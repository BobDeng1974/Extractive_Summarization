by @entity0 everyone cares about their personal safety , but when queuing to see a @entity6 game , or before boarding a plane , lengthy security measures can seem like a drag			1
a new security checkpoint , which resembles hi - tech honeycomb , promises to speed up this tedious process - and has already proved a success at the @entity14 stadium in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the machine scans the contents of bags in seconds to detect weapons and chemicals - without guests having to open them up - and can also process tickets for events , five customers at a time			1
it scans the bags and processes up to five tickets at a time to get football fans into stadiums faster the scanner processes tickets for events , and scans bags at the same time to cut security queues			1
people open one of the doors and place their closed bag inside , before walking round it and collecting the bag at the other side , which has been security checked in a matter of seconds			0
it was trialled at the @entity14 stadium in @entity15 , @entity16 for the @entity6			1
it can handle five customers at a time			0
less security staff are needed as a result of using the machine and it helps protect people 's privacy			0
there are no details about how the machine works exactly , but it uses multiple sensors and an artificial intelligence algorithm to analyse the contents of people 's bags to spot weapons and chemicals			1
the company behind the scanner says it will be rolled out at more stadiums and possibly airports in the future			0
@entity79 , based in @entity80 , @entity81 , deployed its @entity82 for security screening at the stadium , which has a capacity of 43,900			1
‘ the @entity82 automated detection system not only provided highly reliable bag screening , it also put fans " back in charge " of their own belongings as the nature of the @entity82 allowed fans to place their items into the honeycomb shaped device - that conducts five concurrent bag scans - and expedite their entry into the stadium , ’ said @entity101 , director for @entity102 , which organised the security for some of the @entity6 stadiums			1
‘ rather than having stadium officials hand search personal bags , the @entity82 protects the personal dignity of fans and preserves the entertaining aspects of mass sporting events like the @entity6			1
’ the system is designed to speed up the process of people getting into large sporting events and pop concerts , and could be tried out at airports in the future			0
to use the device , people open one of the doors in the hexagon and place their bag inside			0
they then walk round to the other side of the large device , by which time their bag has been scanned			0
@entity79 , based in @entity80 , @entity81 , deployed its @entity82 for the @entity14 stadium in @entity15 , @entity16 , ( pictured ) which hosted @entity6 games and has a capacity of 43,900 at the same time , the machine can also process people ’s tickets			1
and because there are lots of security scanners in the one unit , five customers can go through the security check at once			0
the company claims the machine is the first to combine the initial greeting and ticketing experience for fans , with security screening			0
it added that the @entity144 scans the tickets and bags with far greater efficiency than humans , can detect security threats , improve guest experience and cut security costs by up to 50 per cent			2
the @entity152 has not disclosed exactly how the machine works but says it uses a ‘ fusion of multiple sensors ’ to check for certain chemicals and materials			2
its artificial intelligence algorithm analyses ‘ sensory output ’ in a bid to eliminate ‘ all too frequent human error , ensuring higher detection rates , reducing false alarms while maintaining very high efficiency			0
’ ‘ equipped with an intelligent , threat - learning engine and ongoing updates , the @entity82 is able to respond to ever - evolving threats , both locally and globally , ’ it said			2
@entity168 , ceo and founder of @entity79 said : ‘ we heard from dozens of soccer fans at the @entity6 about how much fun they had personally interacting with the @entity82			2
‘ this is especially gratifying as it validates the core principle of why i founded @entity79 -- to preserve human liberty while offering the most advanced security - screening technology in the industry			2
’ the system is designed to speed up the process of people getting into large sporting events and pop concerts and could be tried out at airports in the future			0

the @entity82 was trialled at the @entity14 stadium in @entity15 , @entity16 , which hosted @entity6 games
machine uses an intelligent algorithm and array of sensors to scan bags in seconds , as well as processing tickets to speed up security queues
it can spot weapons and chemicals more reliably than human searches
giant honeycomb - like machine can process five customers at once
