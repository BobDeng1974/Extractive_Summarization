by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 15 july 2013 meet the ' betches ' - they think being nice is ' boring ' , looks are everything and it 's better to manipulate men for money then earn it yourself with a job			2
their motto is ' if you do n't have anything mean to say do n't say it at all ' and they abide by the rules : ' do n't be easy , do n't be ugly , do n't be poor '			1
according to childhood friends @entity20 , 23 , @entity21 and @entity22 , both 24 : ' life is not a box of chocolates			1
instead , you should give that box of chocolates to someone else to eat , learn from their expanding ass what happens to people who sample chocolates as a hobby , and remain a size 2			2
' mean girls : from left : @entity20 , @entity22 , and @entity21 founded the website , @entity37 , a satirical self - help guide to avoid being boring and nice it is this sort of wisdom that they dish out to their 140,500 @entity43 followers and share on their website www.betcheslovethis.com			1
the trio , all from @entity47 , coined being a ' betch ' while they were at the @entity51 university , @entity50			1
they initially posted their ' five things betches love ' ( talking s * * * , not keeping up with the news , studying abroad , birthdays and diets ) on @entity58 and as their popularity soared they developed the website that now has 3.7million page views a month			1
@entity21 told @entity62 : ' we did n't intend it to be a business			1
' the site has been so successful in the @entity67 - mostly with females aged 18 - 24 - that they have also published a ' self - help ' book , called ' @entity71 in @entity72 ' , and an online shop where fans can buy merchandise emblazoned with the betch mottoes including ' i want to lose three pounds '			1
they now operate from an office in @entity80 with ten staff writers , are in talks for a tv show , and plan to expand abroad , including to the @entity84 , where a number of their betch idols reside including @entity88 and @entity89			1
success : the website gets 3.7million page views a month and has spawned a book and possible tv show in their book , they make comments such as : ' niceness is boring and overrated			1
girls who think that being ' nice ' is something to aspire to are most likely setting themselves up for a life of mediocrity , boredom , and cats			2
' they add : ' you should learn to be a girl who looks out for herself first and does not allow others to take advantage of her			2
ideally , you should be doing the advantage - taking			2
' they state that a ' betch ' should be ' edgy , speak her mind , and commands a room just by being in it			2
' and yet somewhat contradictorily , they state this should be done without trying to command any power in the world or by striving for any worthwhile achievements			2
this is perhaps epitomised by @entity22 who studied pre-med at university but has now given up career plans to be a doctor to instead continuing expanding the betch business			1
' it 's a lot of shock value			0
we 're trying to be funny but hopefully not too horrifying ' thus they now delve out the following career advice in their book : ' it ’s important to realise that as a woman , you have the special privilege of not needing to work as hard as men do - in the general sense - unless you want to			1
' the truth is that men pretty much gave up their right to demand we do anything , if you consider that for most of human existence , society ran pretty smoothly without our involvement			0
we do n’t have to be the bread - winning gender if we do n’t want to be , and we are f * * * ing happy about that			0
' do n’t get us wrong , we ’re definitely progressive and want our s * * * - talking voice to be heard			0
we ’re just saying it ’s perfectly okay to let men believe they are superior beings without whom civilization would crumble			0
regardless of whether you agree , this ego boost is exactly what they need to do things for you ( e.g. , pay for dinner , overachieve on work projects , propose marriage )			0
' in line with this , their role models and ' betch of the week ' are women who have achieve fame with seemingly little talent such as the @entity169			0
they state : ' make fun of the @entity169 all you want , but @entity172 has essentially manipulated the entire world into becoming obsessed with her family ’s every move			0
armed with only a sex tape and a marital bond to a tight - faced @entity180 , the family used what they had to become an @entity67 dynasty			1
' get the book , get the t - shirt : @entity187 fans can buy merchandise featuring their mottoes such as ' i wan na lose three pounds ' the betch phenomenon will shock and appall many - but if that 's the case you 've missed the joke according to the founders			1
' of course it 's satire , ' @entity20 told @entity62			1
' the betch voice has become very easy to us			1
it 's like an evil whisper in our heads			0
the alter egos we 've made ... it 's extremely exaggerated and a bit ridiculous			1
' @entity22 adds : ' it 's a lot of shock value			1
we 're trying to be funny but hopefully not too horrifying			0
' however , it seems the trio do n't always succeed in this given many of their fans are impressionable young girls who do n't get the satire			1
as a result the website has been criticised for encouraging eating disorders by championing being skinny , even if to them it 's tongue in cheek			1
@entity21 told @entity62 : ' none of us would ever want girls to hurt themselves			1
i feel bad that people out here might be taking it seriously , but we ca n't be responsible for everyone who reads our stuff it should be obvious that it is satire			1
' @entity229 : ' proof that image means everything ' @entity229 ' why ? because she was hot , skinny , never seemed to give a s * * * , and her @entity235 alias , @entity229 , did n’t suggest that she was a monster , a toddler , or an @entity238 seasoning			2
' the reason why @entity229 became an icon is proof enough that the image you make for yourself means everything			0
' sure her cheat days consist of a fish egg and two strawberries , but if that ’s what it takes to be married to @entity250 and produce a litter of @entity253 models while never gaining a pound , so be it			0
' @entity88 : ' the only thing anyone says about her is that she 's hot ' @entity88 ' when she 's not being photographed walking down the street holding a new handbag every other day , she spends two days a week ' working ' for her parents ' party company and spends all the other days um , going to parties			0
' she 's even getting paid to ( have someone else ) write a book about parties			2
there 's something to be said for a betch who literally writes the book on partying			2
' but seriously , the girl could be a deaf and blind zombie and no one would know because the only thing anyone says about her is that she 's hot			0
' @entity89 : ' almost fat ' @entity89 ' @entity89 has been accused of being anorexic since she was 14 years old and betch haters all over the world have been trying to say she promotes anorexia because they ’re jealous of her			0
' all these activists for eating seriously need to shut up			0
i mean , @entity281 says she ’s a size 2 and that ’s almost fat			0
' queen elizabeth ii : ' @entity286 of doing nothing ' the queen ' we usually are n’t huge fans of old people who wear pastel colored hats , but @entity285 is the best queen to come out of @entity293 since @entity294			0
' we were born - again fans when she graced the @entity297 opening ceremonies with her famous pout and new @entity300 status			0
' at the tea - scented age of 86 , the only thing older than this betch of the week is her tiara			0
' @entity305 is literally the queen of not doing work			0
born into a life of luxury , she makes the @entity309 look like the @entity310			0

@entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 coined ' *betchiness* ' while at university in @entity67
@entity316 motto is : ' do n't be easy , do n't be ugly , do n't be poor '
they *advocate* being mean , skinny and manipulative
they 've created successful business with website , book and possible tv show
founders say readers should realise offensive content is satire
