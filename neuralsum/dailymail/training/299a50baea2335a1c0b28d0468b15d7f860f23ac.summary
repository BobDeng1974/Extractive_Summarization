@entity1 suggested @entity2 would try to persuade other @entity17 countries to lift an embargo on arming rebels when the current sanctions lapse in may but he said it was ‘ not out of the question we might have to do things in our own way ’			1
this could involve vetoing an extension of the @entity17 arms embargo so the @entity2 could send guns and ammunition to groups fighting to overthrow dictator @entity35			1
he revealed officials have drawn up emergency legislation to bring in a looser package of unilateral sanctions against @entity6 if the @entity17 prohibitions lapse			0
mr @entity1 told the commons liaison committee : ‘ we are still an independent country – we can have an independent foreign policy			0
‘ if , for instance , we felt that action needed to be taken to help bring about change in @entity6 , to help end this appalling bloodshed , and if we felt our @entity50 partners were holding that back , then we ’d have to change the approach			0
but that ’s not what i hope will happen			0
’ @entity54 , @entity55 chairman of the @entity57 foreign affairs committee , warned @entity2 weapons could fall into jihadist hands in the country			1

while the world stood by and has frankly not done enough in @entity6 , what has happened ? as well as 70,000 people being killed , you ’ve seen jihadist elements , as it were , grow			0
