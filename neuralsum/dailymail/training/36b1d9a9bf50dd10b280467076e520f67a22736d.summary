by @entity1 reporter published : 10:58 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 04:25 est , 21 april 2013 an illegal gypsy camp has finally been removed after an epic three - year battle with villagers			1
but in a final show of defiance , the travellers started fires and torched a caravan before they left			1
it comes after a high court judge threw out an application for the infamous ' @entity13 ' to stay on the site on @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , last month			1
the field on @entity15 is cleared by a gypsy following a high court judge order last month local residents have staged a three - year campaign to remove the illegal gypsy camp from the site , pictured the gypsies set a caravan on fire , pictured , in a final show of defiance as they prepared to leave the site up to 200 local residents , many in their 70s , have kept a round - the - clock human barricade on the green belt land since the travellers arrived in may 2010 to the camp			1
the campaign group , known as @entity39 , maintained the vigil in all weather conditions to prevent more travellers from gaining access			1
the protest lasted a whopping 1,086 days			1
head of raid @entity45 said that they were ' relieved ' the gypsies had finally left - but that the battle was still far from over			1
he explained : ' i think there is a great sense of relief that they are leaving			0
but that is just the end of this part of the campaign			0
up to 200 local residents have kept a human barricade at the site since the travellers , pictured , arrived a traveller sits at the door of the last caravan left at the camp ; the protest with villagers lasted 1,086 days ' they still need to return the camp to the way it was the day before they moved in , exactly the way it was			1
' that means not just leaving but removing all the sewerage and water pipes under the ground that they installed and reseeding the ground			0
' we will keep up with targeted protests until that is done			0
there has already been a for sale sign put up on the land			0
' we wo n't pay a kings ransom for the land			0
the long legal battle has proven it is not for residential purposes , it is an agricultural field			1
' there was only one caravan actually left habitable , we saw them burning another one only a couple of nights ago			1
' but now we need to make sure they do n't just bulldoze everything , they must return it to exactly how it was before they came			0
' we have stayed until they have , but we know that the council have taken legal action against both sides - so we wo n't be off the site until monday			1
' we will be holding a minute 's silence to remember all those campaigners who have sat by the brazier , who have attended the protest meetings and gave evidence at the public inquiry but who have passed away and never saw the fruits of their labours and inspirational contribution			1
' their legacy goes beyond the battle of @entity15			1
' the fire brigade and police were called to the camp , pictured , after the gypsies caused disruption the field on @entity15 , pictured , is almost empty except for one occupied caravan as the gypsies leave the local campaign group , known as @entity130 , kept a vigil in all weather conditions to prevent more travellers from gaining access to the field the judge has given the travellers a further month to restore the site , pictured , to its former green belt state the camp was set up after the travellers bought the land from a local businessman for £ 100,000 and moved in over a bank holiday weekend			1
but angry residents wanted to preserve the green belt which separates the village from @entity147 and @entity148			1
they formed a human barricade to prevent a convoy of lorries from delivering 1,800 tons of rubble to the site later that evening fearing it would ruin their tranquility			2
ever since then , local residents have worked on a rota basis , with shifts lasting anything from an hour to overnight			0
the judge gave the gypsies until april 21 to move and a further month to restore the site to its former green belt state			1
the departure of the gypsies is a victory for local residents , pictured , who campaigned tirelessly landowner @entity168 , 48 , a spokesman for the travellers said that there were ' no winners '			2
he said : ' we have been left homeless and the residents have been left with the stigma of the gypsy site having been there			1
' the head of @entity39 's house is still barely worth £ 5,000 even when we have gone , the history of us being there is all over the place			2
' this was never about green belt land , it was only about not wanting gypsies on their doorsteps , they told me that many times			1
' now the people who lived on the site have had to leave their jobs , the only reason there is still a family there is because she had to work her notice			2
' she has made herself redundant from her job because we have to leave and she wo n't be able to go			0
' i ca n't tell you where the families have gone because many of them are forced to stop at the roadside now and the police have moved them on a few times already			0
' we will still be around , you just wo n't be able to see us any more on the land			0
' the council could have helped us , found a new site and moved us in straight away			2
then everyone would have been happy			0
' once the last families have moved out , the work will begin to return the land to its former state			2
' spring 2009 : @entity168 buys land off @entity15 , @entity16			1
