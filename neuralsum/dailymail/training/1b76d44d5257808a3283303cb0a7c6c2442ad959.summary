by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 there is no question : the @entity4 has been a more exciting competition to watch over the last three years than its more glamorous older brother , and is immediately throwing up talking points left , right and centre			1
here , @entity10 takes a look at five ties to keep an eye out for in the first round for a variety of reasons			2
@entity17 vs @entity18 it may be a decade since the birth of @entity17 – obviously coinciding with the dramatic fall of @entity18 - but this remains a bitter clash			2
so much so that the away supporters are refusing to spend a single penny inside stadium : @entity17 such is their overt loathing for @entity29 ’s club and are planning on eating at a nearby @entity30 before the game			2
the @entity33 store does do a mean meatball , in fairness			2
@entity29 , meanwhile , refused to call the @entity17 by their proper name in a recent interview , merely referring to the @entity39 side as ‘ @entity18 ’			2
not happy : @entity18 supporters hold up placards during their game at @entity17 in december 2012 invasion : away supporters celebrate at stadium : @entity17 but @entity47 's side scored an added - time winner @entity50 vs @entity49 this is a big evening for @entity52			1
even though we ’re only in the first week of the season , the former @entity54 boss has failed to win 13 of his last 18 as a manager			1
that includes the rather peculiar home defeat against @entity60 on saturday – his first in charge – and @entity52 needs to get off the mark quickly			1
@entity63 , after all , were n’t too far away from reaching the @entity65 last season			2
a loss to @entity67 ’ @entity49 would n’t be disastrous in the grand scheme of things but it certainly would n’t help the new boss in the short term			1
big evening : @entity52 wants to get himself a first win as @entity50 boss since taking over this summer @entity74 vs @entity75 this will hereby be known as the @entity78 derby			1
the @entity79 lost their club secretary to the @entity39 side during the summer after @entity78 was n’t given a justified pay rise and change in title by chairman @entity85			0
he subsequently moved to @entity86 as chief executive – a role he was performing at @entity89 without the grand title			0
@entity78 moving on has been to the @entity79 ’ detriment ; he signed most of the players and sorted their registrations – something new secretary @entity94 has staggeringly failed to manage as @entity96 revealed he had just nine ( nine ! ) players available on the morning of their first game against @entity99			0
former pool players @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 could also line - up for the @entity105			0
how many ? @entity75 had just nine players registered on the morning of their game away at @entity99 @entity108 vs @entity109 @entity110 is thought to be a touch out of his depth as a manager of a @entity115 outfit			1
even owner @entity116 said as much when talking to @entity10 last week			1
disparaging is probably the word to go for			0
‘ do n’t forget where he came from ; league five			0
he ’s like a baby , who is in a toy shop			0
well , @entity110 lost his first game in charge at @entity125 on saturday , with @entity109 posing a more familiar challenge given the boss ’s previous experience at @entity129			1
saying that , @entity130 have been in the @entity131 since 2006			0
big night for @entity110 , eh ? you do n't know what you 're doing ! @entity108 owner @entity116 ( right ) does n't fully trust @entity110 york vs @entity136 this should be a little bit lively			1
@entity138 is heaped in nostalgia that radiates through the rickety old stands ; it ’s a ground that can create a brilliant atmosphere			0
it has the semblance of a @entity146 derby , albeit a minor one			0
@entity148 ’s side lost away at @entity129 on penalties in this round last year so they ’ll be out for a bit of revenge .			0

@entity116 's @entity108 play against @entity109 at @entity154
@entity75 are set to see familiar faces at @entity74
@entity52 needs a win for @entity50 as they host @entity49
