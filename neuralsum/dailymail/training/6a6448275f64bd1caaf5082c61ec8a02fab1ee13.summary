' shortly after this paramedics arrived and ms @entity8 rushed to meet them at the top of the sand to show them where @entity14 was laying			1
' i raced up the hill to the ambulance man and he handed me a defibrillator and something else , ' the young woman revealed			0
' i went to run back down to the beach and he stopped me and told me to calm down			0

' that was shattering to hear , ' ms @entity8 recalled			2
the 41 - year - old surfer 's body then lay on the sand for ten minutes while a crowd of ' at least 30 people ' watched on			1
