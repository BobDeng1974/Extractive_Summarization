@entity1 's high school football coach has revealed how he used to beat the star player when he misbehaved - and claimed he was thanked by him afterwards			1
@entity3 said that the @entity4 running back would get up to three lashes with an 18 inch long wooden paddle he kept in his office as part of what he called ' tough love '			1
but afterwards rather than crying or complaining to his parents , @entity1 would simply say : ' coach , thank you ' , said @entity3			1
@entity1 , 29 , has been indicted on charges of causing injury to a child after allegedly beating his son , four , with a switch , when he was visiting the player in @entity35 , @entity23 , in may			1
the boy had wounds on his thighs , backside and even his genitals following the beating			2
@entity1 was suspended for one game by the @entity4 but was allowed back onto the team despite his actions plunging the @entity45 into a fresh crisis over domestic abuse , following the @entity49 controversy			1
but in a u-turn late tuesday , he was banned from all team activities until the outcome of the case			1
it followed an intervention from politicians and also some of the @entity45 's top corporate sponsors like @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , who voiced disapproval over the league 's treatment of its player scandals - including the decision to allow @entity1 to continue to play it also emerged on tuesday that @entity1 had also been accused of abusing another of his sons , also four , but no charges were filed			1
@entity3 , 59 , was @entity1 's defensive coordinator and track coach at @entity71 in @entity23 until his student left in 2004 on a football scholarship for the @entity74			1
speaking from his home in @entity76 , @entity23 , @entity3 explained that he used to hit his students if they stepped out of line			1
he said that he talked to his students before he hit them and then explained afterwards why he did what he did			1
he told @entity81 : ' it was n't my intention to abuse the kids , the kids loved me for it			1
i wanted them to do right			2
they said : " coach , thank you "			2
' tough love ' : friends of @entity1 told how his mother , @entity91 , and father , @entity92 , used corporal punishment to discipline the running back			1
@entity92 once whipped @entity1 with a belt in front of his school @entity1 ( pictured with his mother and father distributing meals on @entity102 n his hometown of @entity104 , @entity23 ) was nicknamed @entity105 , or @entity1 , because he had so much energy , but this meant he was more likely to get a ' whupping ' from his father , relatives said coach : @entity3 told @entity81 that @entity1 had ' suffered enough ' ' @entity1 understands corporal punishment ... it 's not intended to hurt anybody , it 's to get them going in the right direction			1
i have never had a problem with parents calling anyone complaining			0
' the way @entity1 came up , his parents , his mother was disciplining him			1
he understands it , it helped his team mates , his classmates			1
i think that ’s what he was doing ( to his son )			2
' @entity3 said : ' his intention was not to abuse the kid			1
he understands corporal punishment and i do n't think his intention was to abuse the kid			0
' we all sometimes make mistakes , not intentionally			0
he just needs to move on from it			0
i think he 's suffered enough			1
i think he 's learned from this '			2
corporal punishment is legal in @entity23 but it can result in a felony conviction if it is judged to be too severe			0
@entity1 's indictment has intensified the scrutiny on the @entity45 and sparked a nationwide debate on the use of violence in raising children			1
it comes after the controversy with @entity49 , who was seen on video in february dragging his then fiance and now wife @entity148 out of a hotel elevator as she was unconscious			0
@entity49 was given a two game suspension by the @entity45 until a video emerged last week of a shocking video from inside the elevator where @entity49 is seen punching his wife out cold			0
@entity49 was then cut by the @entity155 and suspended indefinitely by the league			0
in a statement @entity1 has said that he is not an abuser and the tough way his parents disciplined him has ' a great deal to do with the success i have enjoyed as a man '			1
but his comments have divided his fans with some , including former @entity168 star @entity167 , saying that there is nothing wrong with it			0
others however believe that corporal punishment is a cruel way of raising a child and results in a cycle of violence which @entity1 has been playing out			1
a report in @entity180 has also shed further light on his harsh upbringing at the hands of his father @entity92			2
too far : corporal punishment is legal in @entity23 but is a felony offense if it is too severe			0
meanwhile , @entity188 governor @entity187 said on tuesday that ' whipping a child to the extent of visible wounds ( above ) , as has been alleged , should not be tolerated in our state ' @entity1 ’s childhood friend @entity194 , 29 , said that one afternoon he beat his son with a belt in the car park in front of 20 students at @entity200 because he had been disruptive in class			1
@entity194 told @entity180 : ' we still talk about it to this day			0
my dad was tough , but his dad was real tough			1
' he added that even though it may shock some people this kind of parenting was ' normal ' in @entity104 , @entity23 , where they all grew up			0
@entity1 's uncles @entity209 and @entity210 said that their nephew 's father used to beat his son with a tree branch			1
so keen was @entity214 to discipline his son that when he was told he needed medication for attention deficit disorder he objected and said : ' it 's not something that a little whipping ca n't take care of '			1
@entity1 was nicknamed @entity105 , or @entity1 , because he had so much energy , but this meant he was more likely to get a ' whupping ' from his father , relatives said			1
his stepmother @entity226 told @entity180 : ' i think every parent has the right to discipline their child			0
he ( @entity92 ) would n't intentionally harm his child			0
' @entity1 was suspended on tuesday after a dramatic intervention from @entity188 governor @entity187			1
he said : ' it is an awful situation			0
yes , mr. @entity1 is entitled to due process and should be " innocent until proven guilty "			1
however , he is a public figure ; and his actions , as described , are a public embarrassment to the @entity4 organization and the @entity188			0
' whipping a child to the extent of visible wounds , as has been alleged , should not be tolerated in our state			0
therefore , i believe the team should suspend mr. @entity1 , until the accusations of child abuse have been resolved by the criminal justice system			1
' my attorney has asked me not to discuss the facts of my pending case			2
i hope you can respect that request and help me honor it			0
i very much want the public to hear from me but i understand that it is not appropriate to talk about the facts in detail at this time			0
nevertheless , i want everyone to understand how sorry i feel about the hurt i have brought to my child			0
' i never wanted to be a distraction to the @entity4 organization , the @entity188 community or to my teammates			0
i never imagined being in a position where the world is judging my parenting skills or calling me a child abuser because of the discipline i administered to my son			2
' i voluntarily appeared before the grand jury several weeks ago to answer any and all questions they had			0
before my grand jury appearance , i was interviewed by two different police agencies without an attorney			0
in each of these interviews i have said the same thing , and that is that i never ever intended to harm my son			2
i will say the same thing once i have my day in court			0
' i have to live with the fact that when i disciplined my son the way i was disciplined as a child , i caused an injury that i never intended or thought would happen			2
i know that many people disagree with the way i disciplined my child			0
i also understand after meeting with a psychologist that there are other alternative ways of disciplining a child that may be more appropriate			0
' i have learned a lot and have had to reevaluate how i discipline my son going forward			2
but deep in my heart i have always believed i could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives			2
i have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success i have enjoyed as a man			0
i love my son and i will continue to become a better parent and learn from any mistakes i ever make			1
' i am not a perfect son			2
i am not a perfect husband			0
i am not a perfect parent , but i am , without a doubt , not a child abuser			0
i am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury			0
no one can understand the hurt that i feel for my son and for the harm i caused him			2
my goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that ’s what i tried to do that day			2
' i accept the fact that people feel very strongly about this issue and what they think about my conduct			0
regardless of what others think , however , i love my son very much and i will continue to try to become a better father and person .			1
