the bond between a mother and her children is supposed to be unbreakable , but @entity4 's kids turned her into a prisoner in her own home			1
the 47 year old single mum from @entity8 , was beaten up to 30 times a day by her daughter @entity9 , nine , and regularly locked herself away in her bedroom to escape from harm			1
her son @entity13 , 11,who often joined in with the abuse , was the first to violently abuse his mother - aged four , he stabbed her in the stomach with a pair of scissors			2
unable to cope , @entity4 turned to @entity29 as a last ditch attempt after hearing about their new programme , my violent child			1
in an interview with the @entity36 today , she said : ' i was frightened of my own kids - my legs would often be bruised and i had to keep them covered			0
' the violence got so bad that @entity4 started to dread her children coming home from school and would start shaking as the clock started to move towards 3.30pm			1
@entity4 sought help from the makers of a @entity29 documentary my violent child after years of violence at home at the hands of her children the aggression would often start as soon as they walked through the front door , with the attacks escalating to the stage where @entity9 once bit her face			1
in one incident , @entity13 attempted to strangle his mother from behind while she was sat in a chair			2
but while @entity13 's behaviour calmed down once he was diagnosed with @entity60 , @entity23 's continued to worsen			0
@entity4 said : ' she started off two years ago with controlling behaviour - she would ask me a question like , ' can i have a packet of crisps ? ' but then say ' yes @entity9 '			2
' then i had to say it , but exactly how she wanted me to			0
i could n't say it too fast or too slow , i had to stand still , i could n't move , i could n't blink and she would repeat herself 20 or 30 times			0
' if i said no , she would get louder , start swearing and hit me			0
' @entity4 comforts her daughter @entity9 after one of her tantrums although many people would find it incredulous that @entity4 allowed the abuse to escalate over a number of years without getting any help , she explains that she was too embarrassed to do anything about the situation			2
@entity4 is n't alone - the number of violent young children in the @entity81 is rising steadily , with 118 boys and girls under the age of 14 prosecuted for domestic abuse in 2012/13			1
after contacting the makers of my violent child , @entity4 and her children started working with parenting experts provided by the television station and @entity4 says she has seen a dramatic improvement in their behaviour			1
@entity4 regularly locked herself away on her bedroom to escape the attacks she now puts their aggression down to the fact that there were few rules in her household for the children to abide by , leaving them feeling insecure			1
she told @entity36 : ' i was inconsistent			0
i had no boundaries and had lost my parental control			0
' my violent child is on @entity29 this wednesday at 9pm .			0

@entity4 , 47 , from @entity8 was attacked daily by her children
the mother used to lock herself in her bedroom to escape the violence
she now admits it was because they had no boundaries or rules at home
