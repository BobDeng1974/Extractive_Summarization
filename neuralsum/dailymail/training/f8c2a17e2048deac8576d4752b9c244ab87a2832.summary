missing : @entity7 , 2 , disappeared after playing with her sister outside the family home on saturday march 1 mitigating factors : an @entity20 was issued and police searched the surrounding area in case she wandered off but her family believes that she has been kidnapped the arrest is reportedly being considered as unrelated to her daughter 's disappearance , but @entity12 's mother says that the arrest is serving as an unnecessary distraction			1
' they should have waited because that even took their mind off @entity7 for a moment , ' @entity7 's grandmother @entity33 said			2
' they can pressure @entity38 , but she 'll never give in			0
she 'll never give in because she did n't do anything			0
' the missing girl 's father @entity40 told local station @entity42 that both he and his wife have taken polygraph tests as well as other members of their family			1
not connected : @entity7 's mother @entity12 has a previous felony conviction , the subject of which has not been revealed , but because police found guns in her home during the investigation , she was arrested for parole violation doing their part : @entity12 's husband said that they have both taken polygraph tests in connection to @entity7 's disappearance and police confirmed that the relatives have been helpful and cooperative @entity66 sheriff @entity65 said that the relatives have been fully cooperative and have turned over their suv for inspection as well as a number of undisclosed items from their home			1
' at far as what was in the bags , obviously we 'll start where the child was last seen and we have evidence response folks who are going to that location and recovering evidence and all of this is a collective effort to discover where little @entity7 is , ' @entity2 special agent @entity73 told @entity86			2
' i 'm not going to talk about anything specific with regard to the investigation			0
' sheriff @entity65 did tell @entity42 that one of the reasons why the suv is being checked out is in case the toddler was run over by the vehicle			0
remaining hopeful : police have told parents @entity40 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) that they believe their daughter is still alive even though temperatures have dropped down to below freezing at night @entity7 disappeared between 10.30am and 11am on saturday march 1 but the family did not report it to authorities until about 4pm because they said they did an initial search themselves			1
an @entity20 was issued on sunday march 2			0
' since her disappearance was reported , multiple state , local , and federal law enforcement agencies have participated in a massive , collaborative search effort , ' the @entity108 @entity2 office said in a statement			2
' significant resources have been dedicated to this investigation , including extensive ground and air searches , and utilization of specially trained search teams			0
' what happened ? @entity7 , right , was playing with her sister , left , when she vanished but police have not said anything about what the sister did or did n't see local and federal authorities have searched 4 - square - miles surrounding the family 's home with the help of 300 officers and volunteers as well as search dogs			1
in spite of the fact that she has been missing for 10 days at this point , they still remain confident that she is alive , citing a kidnapping as the most likely scenario			0
