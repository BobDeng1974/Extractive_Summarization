by @entity0 when the fixtures for each new season were published , one of the first games i would look for was @entity5 away			1
once i knew the dates of the @entity8 derby and the showdowns with @entity10 , i would make a point of finding out when @entity12 would go to @entity13 as it was always one of the best away days of the season			1
for starters , more often than not we would come away with three points ; i had a good record at @entity13 — i won seven of the 14 matches i played there in the @entity23 — but it was also one of my favourite arenas			1
the atmosphere set it apart			0
you could feel it on the bus ride in , when you would see thousands of fans in those black - and - white shirts lining the street to give you some stick			0
we used to have a good laugh about it on the coach			0
under pressure : @entity40 has been the subject of intense criticism from @entity5 fans and local media i loved the passion of the @entity5 fans			1
it was the same with @entity48			1
whenever i was up in the @entity49 , i always thought they were two clubs you would love to play for			0
that passion , though , would leave both teams vulnerable			0
@entity5 , for instance , would always fly out of the blocks but we would sit back , soak up the pressure , then pick them off on the counter-attack			1
nobody could ever accuse @entity49 football of lacking emotion but that , at times , is a hindrance and @entity5 manager @entity40 was right when he explained earlier this season how fans can get too high or too low , depending on results			1
it does nothing to help with stability			0
looking on from afar at @entity5 and @entity48 , i have constantly been left scratching my head			1
both clubs have all the elements you need for success — first - class stadiums , excellent training grounds , huge fan base — yet , they always seem one step from turmoil			0
though they lost their first game 4 - 0 at @entity83 , not at any stage have they been threatened by relegation and have n’t been lower than ninth since last autumn , reaching a high of fifth place on november 30			2
given they flirted with the drop last season then began with that drubbing at the @entity93 , having failed to make a permanent summer signing , i expected them to be fighting relegation			1
that they have n’t is credit to @entity40			2
yet he is under attack , from fans and , most worryingly , the local media			0
i remember when the @entity103 turned against @entity104 and @entity105			0
once a manager loses the faith of those you would expect to be sympathetic , it is very difficult to get back onside			0
@entity5 have been on a dreadful run , losing their last four games by an aggregate of 12 - 0 , giving @entity40 ’s critics ammunition , but he has been compromised by the injury to his leading scorer , @entity117 , who has been out since march 1			1
given the circumstances in which he has been forced to work — @entity117 only came in late on loan then his best player , @entity121 , was sold in january without being replaced — @entity40 has done well this season , and overall he ’s done a very good job in the three - and - a - half years he has been there considering he has one of the lowest net spends in the @entity23			1
message : @entity5 fans in the away end at @entity130 hold up a banner aimed at @entity40 loud and clear : some @entity5 fans have called for @entity40 's exit from the club make a comparison with @entity136			1
they and @entity5 are the only teams who you would describe as being consistently mid-table ; @entity140 is getting praise , and rightly so , but @entity5 have n’t spent their money			2
@entity5 are bigger than @entity136 and should be aspiring to be better than them ; they should not have gone 15 years without appearing in a domestic cup final but until @entity145 really invests , it will be difficult to do anything other than tread water			2
@entity136 have also had a flurry of young players coming through and it amazes me that part of the @entity49 , given its size , has not produced any exciting young talents			1
what happened to finding the next @entity155 , @entity156 or @entity157 ? @entity5 and @entity12 are similar - sized cities with the same intensity for football but how can no young kids emerge up there while we ’ve produced @entity163 and @entity164 , while this season @entity166 and @entity167 have come to prominence ? loss : @entity5 have been without striker @entity117 since march switch : @entity121 , who was the heart of @entity5 's midfield , moved to @entity172 why do n’t @entity5 — or @entity48 — have young lads coming through ? both used a director of football this season but whereas @entity178 did n’t buy enough , @entity177 bought too many before he was sacked in january			1
@entity48 , with eight defeats in 10 games , are doomed barring a miracle but their relegation has been coming ; their turnover of players and managers in recent years has been bewildering and success does n’t breed in unpredictable environments			1
@entity188 has had enough time to save @entity48 — compare what @entity190 has done at @entity192 in a shorter period — but there is no doubt he walked into a difficult job at a difficult club to manage			2
competition : @entity136 are two points ahead of @entity5 in eighth place in the @entity23 arrival : @entity167 and @entity166 are the latest talented youngsters to emerge from @entity8 in many ways , you could say the same about @entity5			1
they tried to promote the idea that they want stability but all they succeeded in doing when giving @entity40 an eight - year contract was invite cynicism			2
the @entity49 , with its rich history , has given us names that will stand the test of time ; we will never forget sir @entity215 , @entity217 ’s brilliant attacking side of 1995 - 96 or the @entity48 team that , against the odds , won the @entity220 in 1973			2
to see it now , with both clubs in differing states of turmoil , is a crying shame			0
it should be a football hotbed , not a place that is stuck in the wilderness			0
doomed : @entity48 are bottom of the @entity23 and look set for relegation to the championship to the heavens : @entity188 insisted he will not quit as @entity48 boss despite relegation looming @entity236 and pace no laughing matter for defenders my sympathies lay with @entity242 on wednesday night when @entity236 turned on his afterburners and raced away			1
i knew exactly how the @entity245 defender would have felt as @entity236 ’s change of gear reminded me of the night i gave a hopeless chase to @entity249			0
he actually ran off the pitch , back on again and still flew away from me ! nothing worries you more as a defender than raw pace and the speed of @entity236 and @entity256 could be the difference when @entity258 go head - to - head with @entity260 for a place in the @entity263 final			0
@entity260 are susceptible to counter-attacks , as they are a possession team who play with their full backs high and wide			0
flying high : @entity236 celebrates his wonder goal for @entity258 in the @entity270 final @entity271 : the @entity272 was too fast for @entity242 as he left him for dead on the way to scoring @entity258 , who have been quietly building a head of steam in @entity277 , have the players to exploit them			2
if @entity280 ’s side do progress , it will be more difficult against @entity282 or @entity283 as neither of those sides will play into their hands , but i have had a feeling for a while this might be @entity258 ’s year at long last			0
threat : @entity236 and @entity256 could fire @entity258 to @entity263 glory many wondered how @entity236 would fare after he made his world - record move last summer from @entity295 but his numbers have been excellent and the goal to clinch the @entity270 was his 20th of the season			0
it is great to see @entity236 excel at the @entity301 and he will now be hoping to emulate @entity302 , the last @entity303 winger to play for @entity258 , and lead them to that elusive 10th @entity263 .			0

@entity13 was one of my favourite @entity23 away days
@entity5 have *remained* well out of relegation *danger* all season
@entity40 has been compromised by @entity117 's injury
@entity121 , @entity5 's best player , was sold without being replaced
@entity5 and @entity48 have no young players coming through
