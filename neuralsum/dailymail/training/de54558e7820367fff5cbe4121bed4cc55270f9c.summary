by @entity0 a premature baby who was born 12 weeks early had to be dressed in teddy bear 's clothes to avoid suffocation as she was so small			1
@entity5 weighed just 2lbs 8oz when she was born in march and had a tiny 10 inch long body			1
the newborn was so small that even premature babygrows were too big for her and mother @entity9 was terrified she would suffocate her under layers of clothing			1
@entity5 , who was born 12 weeks early and was so small , her mother dressed her in clothes for teddy bears mother @entity9 , was terrified of suffocating her daughter under layers of clothing , so dressed her in clothes made for toys however , the 24 - year - old of @entity22 , @entity20 found a novel way of dressing her small daughter by using clothes from teddy bears and dolls			1
and now the social worker buys babygrows and outfits made for toys , which fit @entity5 perfectly			1
she said : ' @entity5 fitted in the palm of my hand when she was born			1
' i tried dressing her in baby grows with drawstrings but they were still huge , and they were all so plain and boring			0
even though @entity5 now weighs 7lbs , the same as the average newborn , her mother still buys her clothes from @entity40 and she now has a princess outfit , left and her own raincoat , right ' one afternoon i was struggling to dress her and looked up and saw a teddy bear dressed in a purple fairy dress			1
' it seemed the perfect answer so i took it off the bear and gently put it on @entity5			2
it fitted perfectly and i no longer panicked that she would suffocate herself			2
' in @entity50 and @entity51 , 7.2 per cent of births are to premature babies , who are born before 37 weeks of gestation , with 1.3 per cent born before 28 weeks of pregnancy			2
a baby born at 23 weeks only has a 17 per cent survival rate , but this increases for every week more the baby spends in the womb			0
by 26 weeks the baby has a 50 per cent survival rate , and by 28 weeks , when @entity5 was born , the survival rate is 90 per cent			1
babies born after 34 weeks of pregnancy have almost the same rate of survival as a full - term baby			0
survival rates of very premature babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy have been rising , and have increased by 13 per cent since 1995			2
after making her discovery , the single mother began taking clothes from @entity73 and @entity75 toys and now @entity5 's wardrobe consists of outfits ranging from those for a princess to a pilot			1
she even has a miniature raincoat for the bad weather			0
now at four months , @entity5 weighs 7lbs , the average size for a newborn			0
but unlike most mothers who turn to @entity88 for their children 's clothes , miss @entity85 is still shopping in @entity40			1
she added : ' people always think she 's a doll , so that gave me an idea			0
i started buying @entity97 clothes from @entity40 because they 're the same size			2
' also , once she grows out of the outfits i can put them back on her teddies , so it 's cost effective too			0
' in may 2012 , @entity103 , then 22 , was diagnosed with unicornuate uterus syndrome - meaning her womb is split in two , increasing her chances of miscarrying and premature labour			0
the condition came to light after the birth of her first son @entity112 , now two , who was born at just 27 weeks , weighing 2lb 2oz			0
miss @entity5 also dressed @entity5 in clothes designed for dolls such as those meant for @entity75 toys miss @entity5 says she got the idea of using clothes for toys after people told her @entity5 was so small , she looked like a doll though @entity112 pulled through after three months in hospital , doctors told her it would be almost impossible for her to conceive again			1
in spite of this she fell pregnant in november 2013 and decided to carry on with the pregnancy , despite fears she could miscarry or give birth early			0
earlier this year , the now mother - of - two went into labour at 28 weeks and @entity5 was born			1
she spent the first six weeks of her life on the antenatal ward at @entity133			0
@entity5 had to spend the first six weeks of her life in @entity133 and had a tiny 10 inch body @entity5 , pictured shortly after being born , has also battled blood poisoning and two bleeds in her brain but against all the odds , she has pulled through and now lives with her mother and her older brother			1
@entity5 has also battled blood poisoning and two bleeds in her brain which means she 'll need regular brain scans for the rest of her life to check for damage			0
in addition , she is also awaiting open heart surgery to fix a 3mm hole in her heart			0
but miss @entity5 added : ' despite her health problems , doctors believe she 's got a normal chance at life			2
' we have to take every day as it comes but i 'm confident her and her brother continue to grow into healthy , happy children			0
