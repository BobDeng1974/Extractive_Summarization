a @entity1 post and a @entity3 ad worked together to solve the 34 - year - old cold case murder of a teenage girl from @entity6 who was found stabbed nine times in the woods in rural @entity9			1
@entity10 was 17 years old when she disappeared without a trace after running away from a juvenile detention center in @entity13 in october 1980			1
in january 1981 , police in @entity15 , @entity9 , found a teenage girl stabbed nine times in the back and chest stashed under a pile of leaves in the woods out of a dirt road outside @entity23			1
for 34 years , @entity10 's family searched in vain for the troubled teen			2
at the same time , detectives from @entity15 never stopped trying to identity the body they found mutilated in the woods			0
coming together : the picture at left is the image used by @entity10 's family on @entity3 posts across @entity13 and @entity9			1
the image at right is a rendering of ' @entity38 ' created for a @entity1 page posted by detectives in an attempt to identify a body found in january 1981 @entity10 escaped from a @entity13 juvenile jail in october 1980 after moving from @entity6 with her mother			1
her remains have been found and identified after 34 years relieved : @entity10 's sister , @entity46 of @entity47 , @entity6 , ( center ) with @entity15 sheriff 's lt. @entity49 and sgt. @entity50 now , social media has brought @entity10 's family and @entity9 detectives together			1
in february , @entity55 confirmed that the body in @entity9 matched missing @entity10 's dna , the @entity54 reports			1
new attention to the case has brought forward a potential suspect , as well			0
@entity60 , who is already in prison for an unrelated murder , is named as a person of interest in @entity10 's brutal death @entity10 's sister @entity46 and her friend posted @entity3 ads across @entity13 and @entity9 with pictures of the teen , hoping someone might recognize her			1
at the same time , @entity15 lieutenant @entity49 crated a @entity1 post for ' @entity73 ' ( @entity1 does n't allow @entity75 page names )			1
it included a digitally - rendered drawing of the victim based on her skeletal remains			0
@entity10 's family aznd @entity15 detectives made a connection six days later when @entity15 911 dispatcher @entity82 was trolling through @entity3			1
long road : @entity84 , from @entity6 , was eventually found dead in @entity9			0
she was last heard from in december 1980 and found dad a month later these are the shoes that @entity10 was wearing when she was found dead			0
police posted pictures of them in the hopes of jogging the memory of anyone who may have known her person of interest : @entity60 has been identified as a possible suspect by his own daughter			0
he 's currently in prison for an unrelated murder she had seen the @entity1 page posted by detectives in her department			2
when she stumbled across ms @entity46 ' @entity3 page , she realized that the rendering of @entity38 and picture of @entity10 looked remarkably similar			0
' i ca n't explain it other than this child was meant to have an identity , ' ms @entity107 tells the @entity54			0
perhaps even more remarkable , authorities in @entity15 and @entity10 's family had crossed each other 's paths some 30 years ago in a failed attempt to find the teen and identify the body			2
a coroner in the early 1980s examined the remains to see whether they matched @entity10 's description - but he said they were n't close enough for further investigation			2
ms @entity46 , @entity10 's sister , also considered the @entity15 remains in the search for her missing sister - but says she must have glossed over them , @entity125 reports			1
all the new attention has also brought forward a potential suspect in @entity10 's murder			2
convicted murderer @entity60 's own daughter told the news that media coverage of @entity10 's case jogged her memories that the teen had been staying at their house in 1980 before she disappeared			1
@entity141 says that her father was a violent , abusive man			0
and he was also the one who claimed to have found @entity10 's body in the woods and alerted police			2
detectives have not filed charges , but say they are investigating whether @entity60 murdered the teenager nearly 35 years ago			0
@entity10 's remains have been cremated and brought back to @entity6 , where her family lives			0
