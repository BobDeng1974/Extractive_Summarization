officials stressed that tuesday 's blowout would n't be close to as damaging as the 2010 @entity10 oil spill , in which an oil rig , the @entity12 , exploded off the @entity3 coast killing 11 workers and spewing millions of gallons of oil into the @entity18			1
no injuries were reported as a result of tuesday night 's fire , @entity19 , a spokeswoman for the @entity20 said			1
the blaze continued , unabated , into wednesday she said it was n't known what caused the gas to ignite			2
it also was n't clear early wednesday how and when crews would attempt to extinguish the blaze			1
@entity20 said earlier tuesday that a firefighting vessel with water and foam capabilities had been dispatched to the scene			2
@entity44 was hired to try to bring the well under control			0
@entity19 said @entity44 personnel approached the well earlier tuesday night , before the fire , but they determined it was unsafe to get closer when they were about 200 feet away from it			1
continues : the well is located 55 miles off the coast of @entity3			1
though it continued to burn wednesday , the accident is nowhere near as disastrous as the @entity12 spill , around 100 miles to the east the gas blowout was reported tuesday morning			1
the @entity57 kept nautical traffic out of an area within 500 meters of the site throughout the day			0
the @entity61 restricted aircraft up to 2,000 feet above the area			0
@entity20 said inspectors flying over the site soon after the blowout saw a light sheen covering an area about a half - mile by 50 feet			0
however , it was dissipating quickly			0
earlier this month , a gas well off the @entity3 coast flowed for several days before being sealed			2
@entity70 , a member of the @entity71 in south @entity3 , said the travel restrictions might pose an inconvenience for participants in an upcoming deep sea fishing tournament			2
worse spill : to the east of @entity27 265 , the ill - fated @entity12 spill became the worst in @entity80 history when it caught fire in 2010 and leaked 205 million gallons of oil into the @entity18 ‘ it could change some plans as to where some people plan to fish , ’ he said			2
tuesday 's blowout occurred near an unmanned offshore gas platform that was not currently producing natural gas , said @entity19			0
the workers were aboard a portable drilling rig known as a jackup rig , owned by @entity94 , which was a contractor for exploration and production company @entity96 @entity96 reported to the bsee that the rig was completing a ‘ sidetrack well ’ - a means of re-entering the original well bore , @entity19 said			1
the purpose of the sidetrack well in this instance was not immediately clear			0
a spokesman for the corporation did not have the information tuesday night			1
industry websites say sidetrack wells are sometimes drilled to remedy a problem with the existing well bore			0
‘ it 's a way to overcome an engineering problem with the original well , ’ @entity111 , an energy expert at @entity114 's @entity113 said			0
‘ they 're not drilled all the time , but it 's not new			0
