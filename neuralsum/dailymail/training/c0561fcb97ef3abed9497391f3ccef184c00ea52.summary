fears are growing that @entity2 's boxing career will have to be put on hold , at the very least , after being stabbed in the leg in @entity5			1
@entity2 is now ' stable and sitting up in bed ' , according to his promoter @entity7 , who has flown to the hospital bedside of @entity10 's newest world champion as doctors begin assessing the full extent of the damage			1
there is little or no chance of @entity2 making a first defence of his @entity18 welterweight title as scheduled in his home city of @entity20 on december 6			1
the @entity20 star had won 32 fights as a professional before earning his shot at the @entity18 welterweight title , a journey that had more than it 's fair share of roadblocks			1
@entity2 was the mandatory challenger to the great @entity53 as far back as 2010 but instead had to bide his time			2
a switch to promoter @entity7 saw an upturn in his fortunes as he progressed from fighting in leisure centres to filling out arenas			1
victory over @entity61 two years ago manoeuvred him into position to fight then champion @entity63 but injuries to both men saw the fight postponed three times and eventually cancelled			0
instead , he faced the undefeated @entity36 , outpointing the champion to become the sixth @entity68 to hold a world title in the division and the first since @entity73 's brief stint in 2006			1
that victory should catapult him into the realm of mega-fights with a domestic dust - up with bitter @entity10 rival @entity40 on the cards for next year			0
@entity79 if , as suspected , there is muscle and trauma damage as well as the blood loss which required substantial transfusion , the worst case scenario is that he could miss out on a projected mega-money @entity86 spectacular with @entity40 next year			0
@entity7 told @entity88 on friday : ' i can confirm he has a leg injury but there is no injury to his arm			2
he is stable and sitting up in bed , with his family and myself at his bedside			0
' i have not yet spoken to his doctors so i ca n't comment on the severity of the issues , but i will be making a statement later today			0
' @entity7 was unable to comment on a tweet purporting to be from the @entity95 that claimed the boxerunderwent ' a major operation that saved his life '			0
@entity2 is understood to have been on a night out in @entity106 with his heavily pregnant partner , @entity107 , who left early and was not present when the altercation occurred			2
he is said to have met up with friends after parting company with his girlfriend , before heading back to @entity112 in the early hours			0
it is believed he may have spent time with his attacker on the night of the incident			0
onlookers at the scene , close to the @entity106 resort in southern @entity5 , have described a trail of blood from an apartment at the @entity112 complex , to a second apartment where @entity2 is understood to have attempted to gain entry by smashing a patio window			2
@entity2 is being treated at @entity127 and police remain at scene of both the scene of the attack pictures of blood splattered on the concrete which are said to be connected to the stabbing of @entity2 flying the flag : @entity2 is an attractive opponent for @entity40 having upset the odds to beat @entity36 in @entity42 in training : @entity10 boxer brook , pictured in 2010 , enjoys a run in his hometown of @entity20 rising : @entity2 is unbeaten in 33 fights			1
he was scheduled to return to the ring in december , but that 's in doubt plans for @entity2 to travel to @entity147 next week to be at ringside for @entity150 's rematch with @entity151 have been scrapped already			2
this is not the first time @entity2 has been stabbed as the result of a late night altercation			1
following the first incident , in @entity20 seven years ago , he was out of action for six months			0
it will be deeply unfortunate for @entity2 if these latest wounds jeopardise his career , at 28 , just as he is about to cash in on his unbeaten career			0
his battling , against - the - odds victory over @entity36 in @entity164 a fortnight ago finally made him a world champion and extended his record to 33 straight wins .			1
