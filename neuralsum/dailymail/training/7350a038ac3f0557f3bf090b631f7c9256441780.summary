with temperatures in the @entity2 still baking hot , wealthy @entity0 are seeing out the end of the summer in @entity5 's rather milder climes			1
and , in what is becoming an annual tradition , they have brought their supercars with them			0
as these astonishing pictures show , the streets of @entity10 and @entity11 are still currently lined with expensive motors which have been shipped over to @entity14 while their owners seek shelter from the sun ( not to mention some retail therapy ) in the capital			2
with their @entity21 number plates they 're a traffic warden 's nightmare but a car spotter 's dream , with marques including @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32			1
and they 've all had the requisite custom paint jobs			0
fans of the ostentatious cars , known as the ' carparazzi ' , are descending upon @entity5 to photograph the often extremely rare vehicles			0
but local residents are not fans of the supercar spectacle , complaining the drivers take the parking spaces without respecting parking rules			1
others complain of drivers revving their cars ' engines and treating the well - heeled streets as a racetrack until the early hours of the morning			2
however , as this top picture taken outside the @entity51 shows , either the cars ' owners - or perhaps more accurately , their chauffeurs , are rather good at reverse parking - no mean feat when the car involved is worth north of £ 1million			0
@entity59 : this line - up of two @entity61 , two gold - plated @entity62 , a @entity32 , a @entity30 and a @entity63 , is worth at least £ 3.1 million they can afford a parking ticket or two : this exclusive @entity30 is one of many ultra-expensive cars to have hit the streets of the capital within the past few months summer : wealthy residents of @entity0 countries frequently transport their cars to @entity5 during the summer months to escape the stifling heat in the @entity2 glamorous : the cars - including a @entity75 - have been zooming around pricey parts of the city such as @entity11 , @entity10 and @entity78 a @entity80 car covered in @entity21 writing ( above and below ) as well as photos and social media tags is one of the more unusual sights for the ' carparazzi ' fans sleek : the vehicles , such as this @entity90 ( above and below ) , have been attracting admiring looks from passers - by this summer as their owners shelter from the heat colourful : the cars are often in eye - catching shades and have been customised with scant regard to price or , some might say , taste you would n't call it understated : this gold - plated @entity30 is parked outside @entity105 , where it has received a traditional @entity14 summer soaking high roller : a @entity32 with an @entity21 licence plate parked on double yellow lines outside five - star hotel 45 @entity111 , which overlooks @entity112 shopping trip : an enormous suv parked outside @entity105 , the landmark department store in @entity10 , a favourite for supercar owners this matte blue @entity30 ( above and below ) , one of several on the city 's streets with a @entity80 numberplate , has had a soaking in a @entity5 rain shower end of the season : many of the supercars will soon return to the @entity127 - but some , like this @entity128 , appear to be based in @entity14 full - time glitzy : this silver @entity133 ( above and below ) was yet another one of the glitzy cars to zoom past the @entity51 , infuriating residents on central and west @entity5 this white @entity136 ( above and below ) - one of the supercars transported over to @entity5 for the summer by its rich @entity0 owner - was seen on double yellow lines the sports car , which can sell for up to £ 850,000 and can reach speeds of more than 200mph , was seen parked out @entity105 in @entity10 this week despite being built for the desert sands , a converted @entity142 - worth an estimated £ 350,000 - was among the cars stuck in traffic in west @entity5 this week			1

wealthy @entity0 escape the stifling summer in the @entity2 by coming to @entity5 - and they bring their supercars with them
expensive marques lining the streets of @entity10 and @entity78 include @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32
locals complain their drivers have no respect for parking rules and treat the *smart* @entity5 streets like race tracks
but car *enthusiasts* - *dubbed* the ' carparazzi ' - love what is now an annual spectacle and descend with their *cameras*
