by @entity0 and @entity1 the letters are said to be ¿ particularly frank ¿ and contain the @entity4 's ' most deeply held personal views and beliefs ' on a wide array of political issues taxpayers face a legal bill of tens of thousands of pounds as ministers fight to keep secret details of prince @entity13 ’s political lobbying			1
senior judges yesterday ordered the release of ‘ black spider ’ letters written by the @entity4 to labour ministers , overturning a ruling by the attorney general , @entity19			1
mr @entity19 , the government ’s most senior legal officer , vetoed their release last year , saying it could undermine the @entity4 ’s political neutrality and make it impossible for him to be @entity25			1
but following the judgment , mr @entity19 immediately declared he would appeal the ruling to the @entity28 in an effort to keep from the public the contents of the letters			1
they are said to be ‘ particularly frank ’ and contain the @entity4 ’s ‘ most deeply held personal views and beliefs ’ on a wide array of political issues			1
last night campaigners called for the veil of secrecy over @entity41 correspondence with @entity42 to be lifted and for all ‘ lobbying ’ letters to be made public			1
a @entity45 spokesman refused to comment yesterday saying it was a ‘ matter for the government ’			0
but senior royal sources indicated the @entity4 was unrepentant about the need for ‘ privacy ’			2
a senior royal source told the @entity52 : ‘ it ’s important to place this in context			2
the prince wrote the letters with the expectation of privacy and the government has since legislated to enshrine that privacy in law			2
’ mr @entity19 ’s decision to appeal the ruling sets the stage for an extraordinary tussle in the country ’s highest court between the government and @entity70 , a journalist from the @entity72 newspaper , over personal correspondence from the future @entity25			1
the 27 letters were written to seven different government departments between september 2004 and april 2005			2
letters from the @entity4 became known as ‘ black spider ’ memos because of his distinctive handwriting			2
prince @entity13 at the @entity81 & @entity82 awards at @entity83 yesterday the targets included ministers at the business , culture , and environment ministries , the @entity89 and @entity90 and the health department			0
they were described in court as ‘ advocacy correspondence ’ in which the heir to the throne sought to influence policy			0
mr @entity70 asked to see the letters using the @entity98 but was refused by the government			2
under the law at the time , there was a crucial test attached to royal correspondence which could only be released if their publication was in the public interest			0
attorney general @entity19 immediately declared he would appeal the ruling to the @entity28 in an effort to keep from the public the contents of the letters in september 2012 a tribunal ruled that the letters should be released as they fell into the category of ‘ advocacy correspondence ’ in which @entity13 promoted his personal views or those of his charities			1
the government did not appeal the ruling , but one month later mr @entity19 brought a guillotine down on the release by using a ministerial veto			1
in his ruling , he warned that it the release of the letters risked suggesting the @entity4 was party political because his letters include disagreements with government policy			1
he wrote : ‘ any such perception would be seriously damaging to his role as future @entity25 , because if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the @entity140 , he can not easily recover it when he is @entity25			2
’ but @entity72 appealed the ruling , to the @entity142 , and yesterday the court quashed the attorney ’s ruling			1
@entity146 , the @entity147 , and two other appeal judges said he did not have ‘ reasonable grounds ’ for forming the opinion he did , and it was not justification enough for him to disagree with the tribunal ’s ruling			1
‘ the mere fact that he reached a different conclusion from the @entity158 in weighing the competing interests involved was not enough			0
‘ he had no good reason for overriding the meticulous decision of the @entity158 reached after six days of hearing and argument			0
‘ he could point to no error of law or fact in the tribunal ’s decision and the @entity169 concerned did not even seek permission to appeal it			2
’ the government was also ordered to pay @entity72 ’s costs of nearly £ 100,000			0
in 2011 the @entity98 was changed so all royal correspondence from the @entity25 , the first and second in lines to the throne was exempt from the law			0
but @entity177 , the spokesman for the campaign group @entity178 said : ‘ it is now time the government gave up their fight and accepted the need for disclosure of @entity13 ’s lobbying			0
’ ‘ @entity19 ’s argument is that it is better to pretend @entity13 is impartial than to prove he is not			0
@entity13 is required to stay out of politics , if he is lobbying politicians then the public have a right to know			0
’ ‘ @entity193 now have the complete freedom to lobby the government in secret and on whatever issue they choose			0
‘ the law must be now be changed to allow the public to know when and how @entity13 and other members of his family are lobbying our government			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity19 said he would appeal ‘ in order to protect the important principles which are at stake in this case ’			0
a @entity208 spokesman said : ‘ the public has a right to know if the heir to the throne is advocating policy or promoting causes to government ministers			0
‘ we welcome today ’s appeal court judgement finding that it was wrong to block the release of the letters			1
‘ we hope the attorney general will recognise he has reached the end of the legal road and that government departments will now publish the correspondence so that the public can judge for themselves			1

@entity41 's political lobbying was ordered to be laid bare by senior judges
but attorney general will appeal the ruling to keep letters secret
