by @entity0 three family members suspected of murdering a toddler have escaped justice because police ca n’t prove who was to blame , an inquest heard yesterday			1
@entity7 was found collapsed in her cot with ‘ catastrophic ’ head injuries and died in hospital hours later			1
medical experts concluded that the 21 - month - old girl received the fatal ‘ blunt force trauma ’ injuries close to the time at which she was found dying			1
tragic : @entity17 was 21 months when she died of a blunt force head injury that caused her brain to bleed in february 2012			1
but two - and - a - half years later , no one has been charged with her death family : the court heard @entity25 , pictured with mother @entity26 , came from a loving family who had no contact with social services her injuries were ‘ inflicted by a third party ’ and not the result of an accident , the inquest heard			2
police arrested @entity25 ’s mother @entity26 , 27 , stepfather @entity37 , 34 , and grandmother @entity38 , 58 , on suspicion of murder because all three spent time being ‘ responsible ’ for the toddler during the period when experts said she must have been battered			1
none of them could offer an explanation for the shocking injuries or recall an accident that could be to blame			0
but coroner @entity49 was told that senior lawyers from the @entity51 decided there was insufficient evidence for a ‘ realistic prospect of a conviction ’ and refused to charge any of the three suspects			1
summer was a healthy and happy girl from a ‘ loving family ’ , the @entity58 inquest was told			1
her parents separated shortly after her birth in may 2010			0
miss @entity26 , an ancillary nurse , began a new relationship with mr @entity37 , a tyre garage manager , in october that year and they were living together at the time of @entity25 ’s death in february 2012			1
detective constable @entity67 of @entity68 said there was ‘ no history of violence or abusive behaviour in the family and no social services involvement ’			0
mystery : @entity25 's mother @entity26 ( right ) was arrested on suspicion of murder after medical records showed her injuries could not have been inflicted by accident but was later released without charge confusion : her stepfather @entity82 ( pictured with @entity25 ) was also arrested and then released because the @entity51 could not determine who had been looking after the 21 - month - old toddler @entity25 ’s father @entity85 , 25 , a plumber , was still involved in her care			1
police took statements from @entity25 ’s relatives and medical experts compiled a series of reports into the injuries she suffered			0
the inquest heard miss @entity26 told police she had gone into @entity25 ’s bedroom at 5.30am before leaving for work			2
the little girl said ‘ bot , bot ’ and miss @entity26 gave her a bottle of milk to drink in her cot			0
she then left the house in @entity105 at around 6am , leaving mr @entity37 in charge			2
@entity107 said @entity109 ’ account was that there was ‘ interaction between summer and herself ’ , which indicated the child was fit and well at that point			2
mr @entity37 was briefly ‘ in the house on his own ’ but is not known to have gone into @entity25 ’s bedroom			0
at 7.40am , grandmother @entity38 arrived at the house to take over babysitting duties			2
investigation : details of the incident that led to @entity25 's death are now emerging in a five - day inquest in @entity58 , which her mother ( pictured right with @entity25 ) and other family members are attending the inquest was told @entity25 was ‘ checked on ’ 10 minutes later in her bed and it was n’t until 8.30am that mrs @entity26 realised something was wrong			2
the retired nurse found @entity25 was ‘ not breathing and her head was floppy ’			2
she immediately started cpr and phoned relatives for help			0
when paramedics arrived at the house at 8.54am , @entity25 was not breathing but had a pulse			0
she was rushed to hospital but died early the next day			0
forensic pathologist dr @entity138 , who carried out a post mortem , said @entity25 suffered bleeding and swelling on the brain , and had bruises on her scalp – the classic ‘ triad ’ of injuries ‘ strongly associated with non-accidental infantile head injuries ’			0
dr @entity138 said the fatal head injury was ‘ caused by a third party ’ and was not the result of a trivial impact			1
the pathologist said he did n’t know if @entity25 had been struck with an object or against a wall			0
and the number of injuries to the head indicated ‘ more than one application of force ’ to @entity25 ’s scalp , he said			1
@entity107 said a file was sent to the @entity51 but no one would be charged with any offence in relation to @entity25 ’s death unless fresh evidence came to light			1
he agreed with the coroner ’s suggestion that the ‘ sticking point ’ preventing a prosecution was establishing how the fatal injury had been caused and ‘ who was responsible ’			0
@entity25 ’s parents and other relatives are due to give evidence later in the week			0

@entity181 died of a blunt force injury to the head in 2012
@entity185 , stepfather and grandmother all arrested on suspicion of murder
@entity51 did not charge any of them as ' it was not clear who was caring for summer at the time ' , the inquest continues
