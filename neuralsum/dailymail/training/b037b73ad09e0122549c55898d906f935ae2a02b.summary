by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 it will now be a crime for an @entity5 citizen to travel to a region considered by the government as a ' terrorist hostile area '			1
prime minister @entity9 announced the dramatic new anti-terror laws today , which aim to stop the increasing number of @entity5 heading overseas to join terrorist fighters			1
it will also include the expansion of the definition of terrorism beyond ' terrorist activities ' to threats on social media			1
the wide - spread changes to the definition of the terror come as the @entity9 government announced they would also be backing down on changes to the @entity25 , which would have scrapped a prohibition on offending , insulting or humiliating individuals based on race			1
foreign minister @entity38 said that in @entity39 , up to 30 @entity5 had been identified as fighting alongside extremists but ' five times that number are now of interest , fighting overseas or becoming involved '			1
the @entity9 admitted the proposed changes to section @entity44 of the act had ' complicated ' relations with ethnic groups			2
@entity9 confirmed that the new definition would encompass the behaviour of social media jihadists such as @entity51 , who has tweeted pictures of himself holding decapitated heads , and make them liable for prosecution			2
the announcement of the new laws and an extra $ 630 million in government spending on anti-terrorist measures , comes as @entity51 , the 30 - year - old former boxer fighting with terrorists in the @entity61 , posted claims of how to access deadly explosives in @entity64			1
the 30 - year - old invited jihadists in @entity64 to contact him if they want to get their hands on dynamite and grenades			0
' anyone in @entity64 who is after explosives ( dynamite sticks , c4 sticks , orica mine sticks , grenades ) lots more			0
if interested @entity75 me , ' he tweeted			0
the new law is part of a suite of measures introduced by the government , under which @entity5 could be arrested for travelling to certain terrorist ' hot spots ' without a valid humanitarian reason , causing fears that the onus of proof will rest on @entity5 who visit these areas to prove they did so innocently			1
one of the most controversial proposed measures would see the phone and internet records of all @entity5 held for two years			1
this would apply to metadata , rather than the content of calls and emails			0
metadata is information kept by telecommunications companies - such as phone numbers , email addresses and the dates , times , locations and duration of phone calls			0
under the new laws , the tweets of @entity5 jihadist @entity51 could be classed as terrorism @entity51 invited followers on @entity111 to contact him about obtaining explosives in @entity64 fighting in @entity113 : @entity51 is believed to have left @entity5 last year to fight in @entity113 during criminal or intelligence investigations this content can be accessed , though monitoring phone or internet use over a long period requires a warrant			1
attorney - general @entity120 said last week that data collection and surveillance was necessary for dealing with the ' insidious threat ' of home - grown terrorism			2
the laws have drawn criticism from @entity127 , the @entity128 and civil rights groups			0
opposition leader @entity130 said the changes had been forced on the prime minister and attorney - general , claiming that ‘ @entity120 has been humiliated by his colleagues ’			2
‘ today ’s back down to allow bigots to be bigots , is a victory for ordinary people , ’ mr @entity130 added			0
‘ his ( @entity120 ’ ) priority as attorney - general has allowed racists to be racist			0
’ @entity142 , acting leader of the @entity128 acting leader said the test for any data retention or surveillance should be whether a person is ' reasonably suspected of having committed a crime '			0
' to simply say everything you do online will be stored now and made available to government is over-reach , ' mr @entity142 said			2
this is the second suite of anti-terror laws introduced by the government in recent months			2
in july the government introduced legislation that could allow @entity5 police and security agencies powers to conduct surveillance in foreign countries and tender the evidence in @entity5 courts as part of prosecution in terrorism cases			1
the laws will allow police to conduct surveillance against @entity5 who go abroad to join jihadist movements such as the @entity168 ( @entity168 ) , pictured marching in @entity113 the law would apply to countries where it was impossible to gain consent from local authorities such as countries in the grip of civil war , like @entity113 , or ‘ failed states ’ like @entity178			2
other changes include the power to suspend people 's passports in order to disrupt their travel plans at short notice and allowing the @entity186 to pass on intelligence about @entity5 to its domestic counterpart , @entity189 , under certain circumstances			1
the changes are meant to address the changes to technology which have rendered some current surveillance and eavesdropping laws outdated and the rise of jihadism			0
on the decision of the government to back down on @entity200 of the @entity25 , mr @entity9 reconfirmed the law needed to changed			1
' but i want the communities of our country to be our friend , not our critic , ' he said			0
' i want to work with the communities of our country as ` @entity209 ' here			0
' the government 's perfectly reasonable attempt to amend @entity44 has become a complication we just do n't need and we wo n't proceed with			0

biggest overhaul to security legislation since *post-september* 11 anti-terrorism laws
laws will extend the definition of ' terrorism ' to include tweets
spy agencies to receive more powers
prime minister @entity9 says ' everyone needs to be part of @entity209 '

the government will provide more than $ 630 million to boost the capacity of agencies such as @entity189 and the @entity241
