by @entity0 published : 13:44 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 01:44 est , 27 july 2012 it was hailed as the future of cinema			2
but it seems @entity7 ’s @entity6 boom may be over before it really began			2
film fans fed up with inflated prices are choosing to stick with the traditional @entity11 format instead			0
the @entity12 said 3d films accounted for a fifth of box office revenues last year compared to almost a quarter two years ago			1
legacy : film fans fed up with inflated prices and disillusioned by the lack of added value from watching many movies in the format , opted to stick with traditional 2d showings instead while 47 3d films were released in 2011 – an increase of almost 20 on 2010 – takings were down			1
according to research compiled by the @entity12 3d films accounted for a fifth of box office revenues last year compared to almost a quarter two years ago			1
it found the average cinema in the @entity7 made £ 32,000 from 3d films in 2010 but this had slumped by half to £ 16,000 in 2011			1
the @entity12 report said : ‘ this year saw signs that @entity7 cinema goers are becoming more selective in their choice of 3d films , choosing the format for films where it makes a real contribution to their experience but sticking to @entity11 where they do n’t perceive any added value			1
’ it had been expected the 3d trend would soar after the success of @entity50 ’s epic @entity49 , which made £ 615 million worldwide , with 90 per cent of the audience watching in @entity6 , and the huge popularity of @entity53			1
hit : @entity54 : @entity55 was hugely popular in the format - grossing more than £ 1.2 million but after an initial burst of interest it appears @entity7 cinema - goers do n’t feel it represents value for money for every film			1
the major cinema groups charge customers of 3d films up to 41 per cent more than those seeing standard films and many charge an additional £ 1 for the special glasses			1
a spokesman for the @entity12 explained : ‘ perhaps audiences are becoming more discerning in terms of how they choose @entity6 and whether to pay the premium prices			0
‘ they will choose [ to watch the format ] when it enhances the experience			0
audiences can see where the @entity6 conversion may not be worth the extra few pounds on the ticket			0
‘ he added that instead consumers were opting to watch in @entity6 when they felt it really made a difference			0
for example , motor - racing documentary @entity54 : @entity55 was hugely popular in the format – grossing more than £ 1.2 million , which made it one of the most popular documentaries of the year			1
similarly the re-release of the @entity91 in @entity6 was an “ event ” which meant many wanted to watch a classic in a new format , grossing more than £ 15 million			0
avatar and @entity53 were huge hits in the format in the @entity7 in 2009 and 2010 , grossing £ 67million and £ 73.8 million respectively in the @entity7			1
by contrast the only standout 3d hit last year was the final film in the @entity102 and the @entity103 – part 2 , which was the final film in the franchise and grossed £ 73 million			1
film fans : the only standout 3d hit last year was the final film in the @entity102 and the @entity103 ¿ part 2 , which was the final film in the franchise and grossed £ 73 million in this film publicity image released by @entity109 , from left , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 are shown in a scene from " @entity102 and the @entity103 : part 2			1
" ( @entity115 photo / @entity109 , @entity116 ) the rest of the @entity6 top five for 2011 , which included @entity119 : on @entity120 , grossed under £ 30 million			2
a recent @entity122 poll found that almost half of @entity7 thought the format was “ over-hyped and just a phase ”			2
another reason for the slump in interest , is that 2011 saw a rise in the popularity of character - led films in @entity7 such as @entity133 , which made £ 45.7 million , and bridesmaids , which made £ 23 million , and these do not need the special technology			1
@entity138 film critic @entity137 said that consumers have also wised up to the fact that sum of the “ 3d films ” are simply a rip off			1
he has said : ‘ @entity143 has jumped on the @entity6 bandwagon and is driving it hell - for - leather			0
‘ the irony is that many of the 3d movies that cinema - goers are paying over the odds for are n’t really in @entity6 at all			2
’ he pointed to @entity151 ’s @entity150 , which actually on featured just 30 minutes of his concert in that format			0
an additional problem is that some people feel unwell when watching in this format			0
around 10 per cent of the @entity7 population has poor binocular vision , which means it is difficult for them to see 3d effects in movies and video games			2
instead , they see a blurry image , and will suffer headaches , eye strain and even nausea as a result			0
experts do not recommend allowing children under eight to regularly use @entity6 glasses because their eye muscles are still developing			0
there are also question marks over whether 3d television will really take off , with some industry figures insisting that until a “ glasses - free , affordable ” option is available it is unlikey to			0
some electronics manufacturers have issued disclaimers to protect themselves from legal claims warning that viewing @entity185 may cause ‘ motion sickness ’ , ‘ disorientation ’ and ‘ eye strain ’			0
last year , sir @entity189 warned 3d television would not take off in @entity7			2
the veteran , whose documentary for @entity193 - was made in the format , insisted it would not become the norm for viewers because it was ‘ too isolating ’			0
instead sir @entity189 said consumers would opt to watch ‘ big events ’ in @entity6 such as @entity202 football matches , @entity204 sports , ground - breaking new nature or history shows .			0

while 47 3d films were released in 2011 – an increase of almost 20 on 2010 – takings were down
the average cinema in the @entity7 made £ 32,000 from 3d films in 2010 but this had slumped by half to £ 16,000 in 2011
