the coroner was informed of her death but an inquest was not needed as there were no suspicious circumstances			0
asthma @entity114 said an average of three people died every day from severe attacks , which can be caused by sudden changes in temperature			1
asthma specialist @entity120 said : ‘ on the majority of occasions the blue inhaler – which relaxes the muscles surrounding the airways – works very well			1
unfortunately , in some cases it does n’t work so well and can have tragic consequences			0
’ more than 5million @entity128 suffer from asthma , including 1.4million children , and the disease kills 1,400 people each year			1
asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways , causing them to constrict and resulting in attacks of breathlessness and wheezing			1
breathing cold , dry air , or humid air , and exertion are all possible triggers			0
winter weather means drier air and when an asthma sufferer rapidly breathes in dry air , it dries the airway			1
this releases histamine that can increase inflammation of the air passages in the lungs , leading to bronchospasm – acute narrowing of the airway – which makes breathing difficult			0
these symptoms are aggravated by extremes of temperature			0
in an asthma attack the lungs tighten , and gradually there is not enough air movement to produce wheezing			2
experts call this the ‘ silent chest ’ and it is a danger sign of a severe asthma attack			2
popular : friends of @entity2 paid tribute to her on social networks such as @entity89 after her tragic death a sudden change in temperature puts stress on the body and is a common trigger for an attack , according to the @entity179			1
‘ it ’s been long known that in people with asthma who are n’t controlled , just swallowing cold or hot liquids can set off an asthma attack , ’ says dr @entity181 , president of the @entity182			2
‘ the temperature sets off a bronchial spasm			0
we know that a change in temperature , down or up , can set it off			0
’ changes in temperature are also associated with more serious attacks in youngsters			0
a 2009 study from the @entity195 suggested that jumps in temperature and humidity were associated with a rise in asthmatic children going to @entity201			0
breathing hot or cold air can also have an irritating effect on the airway			0
this can cause the muscles of the air passages in the lungs to go into spasm and the linings of the airway swell making sufferers gasp for breath			0
attacks can usually be controlled by using a blue reliever inhaler and breathing slowly and deeply			0
however , an ambulance should be called if the attack shows no signs of easing after a few minutes			0
asthma @entity114 recommends sufferers to take their usual dose of reliever inhaler before going out on cold , dry days			2
if it 's cold and windy , wearing a scarf over your face will help to warm up the air before you breathe it in			0
@entity120 , an asthma nurse specialist from @entity114 , told @entity229 : ‘ people with asthma have airways that are very sensitive and twitchy			2
they can quickly go into spasm if there is a trigger , such as a change in temperature or inhaling smoke			0
‘ a recent survey of our users revealed 75 per cent of sufferers found cold air can trigger an attack			0
‘ the trick with asthma is to make sure it is controlled all the time			2
a preventer ( brown ) inhaler works to stop the airways being so sensitive in the first place			0
if they are triggered a blue ( reliever ) inhaler helps			0
‘ if people find they need their blue inhaler three or more times a week they should go back to their doctor to look at their brown inhaler dosage			0
