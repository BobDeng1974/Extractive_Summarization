@entity0 turned sunday 's @entity1 into a procession courtesy of an astute ride from @entity4 , handing owner @entity5 and trainer @entity6 their first ever @entity8 winner in the process			1
@entity4 was at his sharpest tactically aboard the six - year - old , narrowly beaten in the prestigious staying event two years ago , as he allowed his charge to track runaway pacesetter @entity15 , a move which saw the two front - runners establish a 10 - length lead turning for home			2
once @entity20 cracked in the straight , @entity4 sauntered past aboard the admirable stayer and merely needed to keep his mount up to his work to score by six - and - a - half lengths from favourite @entity26 , who snatched second from @entity28 in a bunch finish for the places			2
a delighted @entity31 was thrilled to have repaid the faith shown to him by connections			0
@entity0 comfortably won the @entity1 after being directed by jockey @entity4 @entity5 ( left ) , who owns @entity0 , smiles and pats his horse following the @entity1 victory he said : ' i 've been riding for @entity6 ( @entity39 ) for a good few years and he 's been very supportive of me for a good while so i am delighted to ride a high - profile winner for him			1
' the plan was to get our lad in behind a couple of rivals and get him to drop his head , but he jumped very well and they went a nice gallop so i was pleased where i was			0
' we know our lad does n't stop when he gets to the front so i was n't worried about being there so far out			0
i am very pleased for the horse and for the connections and the yard as he deserves a big one			0
