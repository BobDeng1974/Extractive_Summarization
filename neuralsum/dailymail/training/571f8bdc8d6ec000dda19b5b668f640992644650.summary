i have other sacrifices – i live between two places , it ’s difficult because there are always lots of people wanting to criticise what you do			0

’ miss @entity0 was asked by @entity7 – who was the mp ’s boss when she started in television – if she had designs on @entity12			1
she was also asked about not having children by panellist @entity32 loose women presenters @entity64 and @entity67 questioned miss @entity0 about her plans to inspire young girls to aim higher miss @entity0 appeared on the programme to push her new campaign to break open traditionally male professions for women			1
it comes after she said girls should be encouraged to run around and climb trees as it could help them have more confidence at the workplace in later life			2
miss @entity0 said there is evidence men are more likely to put themselves forward for promotion at work , because they have been ' pushing the boundaries ' from a young age			1
a traditional upbringing in which boys tear around and make dens , but girls sit quietly with their parents has an impact in later life , with women sometimes reluctant to put themselves forward because they are ' looking for acceptance ' , she said			1
recent research has shown that men are more likely to embellish their cvs than women when applying for a job			2
miss @entity0 said girls should be encouraged to run around and climb trees as it could help them have more confidence at the workplace in later life head - hunters have also said they check men 's cvs for longer than women 's because men are more likely to exaggerate their experience while women underplay theirs			1
' there is an element of confidence there ' , the conservative cabinet minister said			0
' i thought it was very revealing that head - hunters check through a woman 's cv for something like 25 minutes to analyse because the chances are she will play down her achievements			0
' whereas it can take two - and - a - half hours to check a bloke 's because they 'll write about things as if they have done them , when in fact that would be a promotion ' , she said in an interview with the @entity134			0
@entity20 , asked about miss @entity0 's admission , said he did not want to put a limit on anyone 's ambition ' i think girls , whether it 's the way they 're brought up , they sit quietly beside mum and dad and speak when they 're spoken to , and boys are allowed to run around outside and climb trees and make dens , and that actually does have an impact later on in life where girls are frequently looking for acceptance by others , whereas boys are much more naturally pushing the boundaries			1
' miss @entity0 will appear on @entity4 's @entity3 tomorrow as part of a series on election issues			1
she will launch the # notjustforboys campaign , intended to boost the number of women in jobs where they are under - represented such as construction science , it and engineering in which 12million jobs will be created in the next decade			2
the minister said these choices need to be influenced at a young age			1
as well as their upbringing , she said girls need to be encouraged to choose ' the right subjects at @entity172 and a-level so you do n't limit your choices later in life , because these are the fast - growing areas , the ones with the greatest opportunities and the ones paying the most money ' , she said			2
' that 's where advanced economies are going , we 've got to make sure our young people are up to speed and can compete in the jobs market			1
' she said misconceptions that tech industries were not glamorous were being rapidly broken down , and girls working in it were increasingly being seen as ' the new it girls '			0
' i would like to think the it girl is the new it girl ' , she said			0
' it is about being powerful and creative , not just an attractive image but being in charge of your own destiny			0
' there 's a lot of people who are getting to 18 or 20 and saying if only i 'd known , if only i 'd got the right subject grades at a levels i would have taken those options			0
we just want to make sure that girls are going forward			0
' among engineering professionals only 7 per cent of women are working in that area			0
yes it has gone up since 2011 , but that 's 93 per cent of women who might think " i would have done that "			2
' so many people like to use the latest phones or programmes , we are saying do n't just be the consumer of technology , be the creator and think of the opportunities that will open up for you			0
