@entity0 had to wait a long time before his sceptical captain gave him a proper bowl on sunday			0
but in wrestling back a test that had been slipping from @entity6 ’s grasp , he soon showed he might become more than just a bit - part spinner			2
@entity8 has made it clear with his sparing use of @entity11 in this two - @entity13 series that he remains far from convinced the @entity15 all - rounder is the man capable of stepping into @entity17 ’s massive shoes			0
it seemed almost in desperation that the @entity6 captain finally threw him the ball with just over an hour of the third day to go			0
he had given @entity22 just one over before then in @entity24 ’s second innings on this dry @entity26 pitch			1
a test that @entity6 had dominated for most of the first two days was slowly being turned on its head by the @entity30 giants @entity31 and @entity32 , and @entity8 ’s need of a breakthrough was becoming acute			1
@entity36 pleased with late breakthrough against @entity24 breakthroughs : @entity0 claimed two wickets in two balls when @entity24 were cruising at @entity26 big wicket : @entity42 celebrates as @entity24 's @entity31 was given out lbw off @entity22 's bowling @entity44 wickets : @entity22 looks determined after taking the wicket of @entity31 for 55 runs short stuff : diminutive but hugely experienced , @entity32 withstood some aggressive bowling @entity49 a job : @entity32 acknowledges his 50 milestone but will be key to @entity24 setting a big total enter the man the @entity54 marketing men call the ‘ beard that ’s feared ’			1
@entity31 , who had just become only the fourth man to record seven consecutive test scores of 50 or more , was in the mood to turn what might be his last test innings in @entity6 into something considerably more substantial			1
yet @entity22 , who had dismissed @entity31 for his first @entity64 wicket at @entity65 , quickly made him his second victim when one of the greatest of all batsmen played him the old - fashioned way with his pad rather than bat , and was lbw			1
@entity8 could easily have then taken @entity22 off to attack @entity72 with either of the men who have tormented him in this series — @entity75 and @entity76 — but he kept his spinner on and was immediately rewarded			2
@entity72 was dismissed for two and two at @entity65 and was out first ball in the first innings here			0
perhaps ominously , with @entity82 due to bowl last , @entity22 got appreciable turn and @entity72 was bowled by a beauty to complete his pair			1
it was two wickets in three balls for @entity11 , and how @entity6 needed that double strike			2
when they had battled their way to 311 for three on saturday thanks to @entity92 ’s maiden hundred in reply to @entity24 ’s 257 , there seemed only one possible winner of this decisive test			0
@entity97 is the world 's best batsmen - @entity98 another milestone : @entity31 earlier reached a record - equalling seventh consecutive half - century danger man : the veteran left - hander added 55 runs to his 79 in the first innings yet the dismissal of @entity107 , frustratingly strangled down the leg - side , was the catalyst for a transformation that saw @entity24 take @entity6 ’s last seven wickets for 54 runs and then fight their way to 214 for four by sunday ’s close			1
thanks to @entity22 , @entity6 remain favourites but if @entity24 can extend a lead that currently stands at 106 beyond 200 , then a team without a test win since their third in the @entity120 last summer at @entity121 will be decidedly twitchy			1
this was undoubtedly @entity24 ’s day from the moment their impressive captain @entity123 showed his seamers how to do it by putting the ball in the right place at barely 75 miles per hour and letting the conditions do the rest			0
@entity123 , little more than an occasional bowler , had struck twice on saturday and took two of the last four @entity6 wickets to fall , with the notoriously fickle @entity26 pitch suddenly resembling a minefield			1
stranded : prior managed just 27 not out before he ran out of partners as @entity6 lost four wickets for 45 runs @entity140 knocked over : @entity76 walks off after his middle stump was displaced by @entity123 opening up the shoulders : with wickets falling around him @entity42 hit @entity144 for six when @entity6 ’s last two men in @entity76 and @entity75 fell to near - unplayable balls , @entity8 ( below ) would have been confident that a lead of 108 would prove decisive			1
but his seamers got it all wrong and @entity24 displayed considerable spirit			0
@entity6 clearly expected uneven bounce but little came when they kept on bowling a fraction too short			0
they did not help themselves with yet another fielding lapse , @entity154 dropping @entity155 when he was on four			0
a wicket then would have exposed @entity31 to the new ball and things could have been very different			0
but @entity75 and @entity161 , worryingly with five tests to come against @entity160 in just six weeks , struggled to make an impression and looked out on their feet by the close			0
it was left to @entity76 , seizing his second chance in test cricket , to take the first two wickets but with @entity31 and @entity32 both reaching their half - centuries @entity8 was running out of ideas before he turned to his spinner			1
floored : @entity154 drops a catch off the edge of @entity24 's @entity155 at second slip out of character : the athletic fast bowler put down a straightforward catch off @entity75 's bowling no idea : @entity75 cops a brilliant bouncer from @entity184 which he can only glove to the bowler ‘ it was nice to contribute and get us back in the game , ’ said @entity22 , who even bowled his doosra in the seventh of his nine overs			1
‘ they were playing very well at the time and i just tried to bowl as straight as i can to sanga because if you get it slightly wrong he can take you apart			0
’ @entity6 still have much to do and @entity32 , almost certainly playing in his last test in @entity6 , is still there after surviving a reviewed lbw call from @entity76 on 45 that just about went in his favour			2
together with @entity123 he could yet push @entity24 ’s lead beyond the 225 which they think , with @entity82 in their ranks and the pitch expected to offer more turn on the last two days , will win them their first @entity64 series in @entity6			2
it is up to @entity6 , who squandered seven chances in @entity24 ’s first innings before throwing away their position of dominance with the bat , to make sure they make no further mistakes .			2
