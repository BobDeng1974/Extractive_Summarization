the deaths of three people who developed a foodborne illness linked to some @entity4 ice cream products has prompted the @entity7 icon 's first product recall in its 108 - year history			1
five people , in all , developed listeriosis in @entity11 after eating products from one production line at the @entity4 creamery in @entity15 , @entity7 , according to a statement friday from the @entity17			1
the @entity17 says listeria bacteria were found in samples of @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , scoops , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
there appeared to be some uncertainty as to where the patients acquired the listeria bacterial infection			0
according to a friday statement from the @entity46 , all five of the people sickened were receiving treatment for unrelated health issues at the same @entity11 hospital before developing listeriosis , ' a finding that strongly suggests their infections ( with listeria bacteria ) were acquired in the hospital , ' the @entity46 said			1
of those five , information was available from four on what foods they had eaten in the month before the infection			0
all four had consumed milkshakes made with a single - serving @entity4 ice cream product called ' scoops ' while they were in the hospital , the @entity46 said			1
' scoops , ' as well as the other suspect @entity4 items , are mostly food service items and not produced for retail , said @entity70 , ceo of the @entity15 creamery			1
@entity4 says its regular @entity27 were untainted , as were its half gallons , quarts , pints , cups , three - gallon ice cream and take - home frozen snack novelties the @entity46 said the listeria isolated from specimens taken from four of the five patients at @entity52 in @entity83 , @entity11 , matched strains isolated from @entity4 products obtained this year in @entity86 and @entity7			1
the five patients became ill with listeriosis during their hospitalizations for unrelated causes between december 2013 and january 2015 , said hospital spokeswoman @entity90			0
' @entity91 was not aware of any listeria contamination in the @entity4 ice cream products and immediately removed all @entity4 products from all @entity96 locations once the potential contamination was discovered , ' @entity90 said in a statement friday to @entity99			1
@entity96 has eight hospitals in @entity11 and @entity101			0
@entity4 handles all of its own distribution and customer service , @entity104 said , so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves , most of them institutional , as soon as it was alerted to the @entity86 contamination feb. 13			2
@entity104 did not suspect handling of those products after they left the @entity7 creamery			2
' the only time it can be contaminated is at the time of production , ' he said			0
that contamination has been traced to a machine that extrudes the ice cream into forms and onto cookies , and that machine remains off line , he said			1
all products now on store and institution shelves are safe and wholesome , @entity104 said			0
however , ' contaminated ice cream products may still be in the freezers of consumers , institutions , and retailers , given that these products can have a shelf life of up to 2 years , ' the @entity46 statement said			2
@entity4 handles all of its own distribution and customer service , @entity104 said , so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves , most of them institutional @entity46 recommends that consumers do not eat products that @entity4 removed from the market , and institutions and retailers should not serve or sell them			2
listeriosis is a life - threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called listeria monocytogenes , the @entity46 said			2
the disease primarily affects pregnant women and their newborns , older adults , and people with immune systems weakened by cancer , cancer treatments , or other serious conditions ( like diabetes , kidney failure , liver disease , and @entity162 )			0
rarely , people without these risk factors are affected			0
a person with listeriosis usually has fever and muscle aches , sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms			0
almost everyone who is diagnosed with listeriosis has invasive infection , meaning the bacteria spread from their intestines to the blood , causing bloodstream infection , or to the central nervous system , causing meningitis			0
although people can sometimes develop listeriosis up to 2 months after eating contaminated food , symptoms usually start within several days			1
listeriosis is treated with antibiotics , the @entity46 said .			0

listeria bacteria were found in samples of @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , scoops , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity193
