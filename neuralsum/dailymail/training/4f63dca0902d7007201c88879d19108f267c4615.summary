by @entity0 published : 18:24 est , 22 september 2012 updated : 05:18 est , 23 september 2012 home secretary @entity1 moved yesterday to damp down calls for a return of the death penalty after the murder of @entity7 policewomen @entity8 and @entity8			1
the callous killing of the two pcs , aged 23 and 32 respectively , led to demands for capital punishment , abolished in 1965 , to be restored			1
the calls were supported last week by @entity13 , widowed husband of pc @entity14 , who was shot dead in @entity16 in 2005			0
call for calm : @entity1 is against return of the death penalty they receive further qualified backing in a new @entity23 poll			1
but mrs may told this newspaper last night that the death penalty would not have prevented the killing of pcs @entity8 and @entity29			1
‘ the murder of @entity8 and @entity8 was a callous and cowardly act , ’ she said			0
‘ but i do not believe in the death penalty , and i do not believe that the death penalty would have acted as a deterrent in this case			2
’ nor did mrs may think arming more police would help			1
‘ we have armed response units who are there to deal with specific threats , but i do n’t want to see police officers routinely carrying guns			1
’ the complications involved in reintroducing capital punishment are illustrated in a @entity47 poll of 1,012 people interviewed online on thursday and friday			2
poll : a survey shows the public 's opinion is split a total of 48 per cent want it restored , with 44 per cent against			1
if it were to be reintroduced , there is a clear preference for executing capital offenders by lethal injection , which is favoured over hanging or the electric chair			0
a surprisingly high number of those who support lethal injections for murderers , two out of three , say they would be prepared to administer the fatal doses themselves			0
however , when the survey delved further into public opinion , the balance appears to tilt in the opposite direction			0
it could lead to murderers having a greater chance of getting away scot free			0
nearly one in four say they would be less likely to return a guilty verdict if they were a juror in a murder trial where the accused faced the prospect of execution instead of jail			0
and more than half say a higher burden of proof would be required			0
similarly , nearly half want more police to be armed			2
but when the pros and cons are explored in greater detail , voters appear more equivocal			0
a total of 67 per cent say carrying guns would not have saved pcs @entity8 and @entity29			1
the public believe police would be marginally at greater risk themselves if they were all armed			2
and 51 per cent say it would lead to more killings by police of innocent civilians , against one in ten who say there would be fewer deaths			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

comes after a @entity23 poll shows 48 per cent want penalty restored , with 44 per cent against
may is also against arming officers , and does not want to see police ' routinely carrying guns '
