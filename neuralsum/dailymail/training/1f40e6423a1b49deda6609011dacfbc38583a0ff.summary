by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday @entity3 correspondent there are those whom @entity6 chooses to bless ... and to say he has been generous to @entity8 would be a vast understatement			1
in her 1980s prime she was a supermodel before the word had even been invented , and today , just three months shy of her 60th birthday , she looks almost exactly the same as she did when she starred in the video of @entity15 , the song her now - ex husband @entity16 wrote for her			1
@entity8 has grown accustomed to exclamations of amazement over her appearance and finds what she calls the ‘ pushing 60 obsession ’ hilarious			1
less amusing , however , is the frequent assumption that her life is without problems			1
protective : @entity8 said she will never let online trolls drive her daughters @entity30 , left , and @entity31 , right , to depression in fact , she and her family have been through a very modern ordeal , one that underlines just how much the world of celebrity has changed			1
indeed , her daughter with @entity16 , @entity30 , was rushed to hospital following a suicide attempt – a victim , @entity8 says today , of the now pervasive culture of vicious online bullying , or ‘ trolling ’			1
no wonder the model says it is now time to the insidious internet anonymity that allows people to persecute others without consequence			1
@entity30 , now 27 , was already in a fragile state of mind in 2009 following a break - up with a boyfriend when the bullying began , explains @entity8			1
and in her delicate condition , the online taunts about her appearance and talent were enough to push her over the edge			1
recently , @entity30 – a budding singer - songwriter who hopes to follow in the footsteps of her father – singled out gossip blogger @entity62 as being one of the worst culprits , saying : ‘ they used to pick on my looks and i used to care too much about how they perceived me			1
@entity62 labelled me a slut			1
i know what it feels like to be bullied			1
on a very large scale			1
’ sitting in her sprawling home in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity8 makes no attempt to hide her distress as she describes the traumatic events that hit the family			1
star parents : @entity80 attracted criticism from online bullies who accused her of cashing on the fame of her parents @entity16 and @entity8 choked with emotion , she says : ‘ what @entity80 has to deal with , what she ’s been through , is the most upsetting thing i ’ve ever had to face			1
as a parent you want to protect your child			1
your whole life revolves around wanting to keep your kids safe , happy and healthy			2
and when you have these evil , hurtful forces that you ca n’t protect them from it ’s just agonising			2
’ describing @entity80 as a ‘ sensitive , late - blossoming child ’ , she says her daughter was deeply wounded by the constant criticism she received , purely as a result of being the daughter of famous parents			1
@entity8 remembers one particularly vicious comment : ‘ they said she looks like the father and sings like the mother			1
’ it is a mentality that is incomprehensible to her			2
@entity112 : @entity8 , pictured during her modelling days , said she was shocked when she discovered the world of online bullies she says : ‘ it bothers me as a human that our society has got to this level			1
my daughter is a beautiful , talented person			1
now she has blossomed , looks-wise , they say , “ oh , it ’s all plastic surgery ”			2
she had a tweak on her nose and that ’s the only thing she ’s ever had done			2
‘ but what bothers me on a personal level is @entity30 seems to be under so much scrutiny and she ’s just a kid			2
we ’ve turned into a society which is used to focusing on the negative			2
we should be supporting each other			2
’ bullies have also attacked @entity8 ’s youngest daughter @entity31 , now 15 , who has recently taken her first tentative steps into the modelling world			1
@entity8 – who also has an 18 - year - old son , @entity139 – may be an internationally famous model and actress , but she sounds like any ordinary mother when she speaks about her concerns			1
‘ it ’s a different world today to the one i grew up in , ’ she says			2
‘ @entity146 follows children home			2
the invasiveness is new and every parent is trying to deal with it			2
‘ i call it “ the other people at the table ”			2
you have to share your kids with the computer and the mobile phone and you do n’t have as much influence as a parent any more because these other people are in your kids lives 24/7			2
' driving to and from school was my time to talk to the children in the same way my parents talked to me			1
now i say something and i hear ‘ uh huh ’ and i look in the rear view mirror and my children are texting			2
’ she says she first discovered the online bullies while going through a bitter divorce from @entity31 ’s father , architect @entity172			2
during their court battle it was revealed he spent thousands on internet porn and cheated on her with the 18 - year - old daughter of a neighbour			1
‘ the blogosphere is the meanest , nastiest place in the world , ’ she says			2
‘ i was never in the computer world until my last divorce			2
for the very first time i got on to the computer and started trawling			0
i looked at some of the stories and would scroll down to the comments			0
@entity191 : @entity30 , above , was criticised by celebrity and showbiz blogger @entity62 among other online bullies ‘ i ’d never even heard of some of the words they were using			1
i discovered the internet is where people with chips on their shoulders can assume a fake identity and just spew venom and bitterness			0
’ she has been shocked to discover that every stage of her children ’s lives has been documented in often cruel detail , but says she now does not even read the comments : ‘ at this point none of us go there			0
’ @entity8 admits she uses social networks to keep her fans up to date – and believes ensuring everyone is identifiable online is the answer			1
‘ i think people need to operate on the worldwide web as themselves , ’ she says			0
‘ i think that ’s the solution			0
we should insist that they use their real identity – like a driver ’s licence			0
‘ people need to be responsible and accountable for their actions and what they have to say about people			0
’ trim : the 59 - year - old supermodel is the same height and weighs the same as her 15 - year - old daughter she ca n’t have failed to notice the attention her own appearance receives online			1
in her case , most of the comment are positive , yet she is keen to downplay the obsession with her age			0
‘ i ’m not the only 59 - year - old who looks good , ’ she says			0
‘ i think there are millions of fit , fabulous 59 - year - old women out there but they are telling everyone they ’re 49			0
women should own their age			0
we should n’t fudge the figures			0
’ @entity8 has never commented previously on rumours her good looks could have had artificial help , but today , for the first time , she admits to experimenting with @entity254 – but says : ‘ it ’s not for me			1
‘ i did n’t like the feeling			0
i like to make lots of faces			0
i like to hold up my eyebrows			0
when i could n’t move my forehead it made me feel depressed			0
' i looked like a boxer who had taken a blow to the head			0
plastic surgery is up to an individual			0
i would caution young girls not to go there			0
you see people with overinflated lips and overinflated cheeks			0
i think that look is ageing rather than anti-ageing			0
’ she is proud of the fact that she and her 15 - year - old daughter – both 5ft 9in – weigh exactly the same			1
‘ we share clothes but it ’s a different weight distribution			0
she ’s a smaller jean size			0
i ’ve got child - bearing hips ’			1
@entity8 has followed a vegetarian diet since the age of 12 and works out regularly in her home gym			1
two years ago , she played @entity286 in the @entity288 and @entity289 production of @entity290 , receiving plaudits for her stamina			0
she does admit to using ‘ tricks ’ to improve her appearance , including clip - in hair extensions , which she is selling through the hair2wear.com company			0
‘ i started using them during @entity290			0
i ’d come off stage and my head would be a mess			0
i ’d take off my @entity303 wig and my hair would be wet at the side and the centre was a springy mess			0
i ’d put on a wig or pull my hair back and put on a ponytail			0
it ’s a simple trick all women can use to look and feel better about themselves			0
’ she says she will never marry again but refused to comment on whether there is a man in her life , saying : ‘ some things are private			0
’ she is famously still close to @entity16 , who this week embarks on a @entity318 tour , and speaks about him with warmth			1
‘ when @entity30 was a baby i ’d put her on his piano lid because i wanted the music to vibrate through her body and infuse her with his talent			0
as she grew up that was her favourite place			0
‘ @entity16 did a concert with @entity327 for president @entity328 and i stood in the wings with @entity328			1
@entity80 walked out on stage and @entity16 picked her up and put her on the lid of his piano			1
‘ the president said to me , “ is n’t that wonderful ? i ca n’t believe i ’m here with you , ” and i said , “ mr president , i ca n’t believe i ’m here with you			0
