by @entity1 reporter created 1:08 pm on 3rd august 2011 it 's a radio station known for irreverent chat , where current affairs and topical discussion reign supreme			1
but @entity6 took on a more otherworldly tone this morning when one of its own sports reporters claimed he had a close brush with a @entity11			1
' freaked out ' sports journalist @entity12 said he was left gobsmacked when he spotted a huge ' disc - shaped ' aircraft hovering above the @entity15 countryside on his way to work in the early hours of the morning			1
unidentified : sports journalist @entity12 says he saw a disc - shaped craft hovering over a @entity15 village mr @entity12 was driving from his home in the @entity20 to catch an early morning flight from @entity23 airport when he saw the @entity11 in the night sky over the village of @entity26 , near @entity27 , he claimed			1
he called his employers at @entity6 and his interview with presenter @entity30 was broadcast to millions of listeners			1
he said : ' i was probably about 15 or 20 miles from @entity23 at 4.15 in the morning and there was this big bright light in the sky descending towards the road			2
' as it got closer it then banked to the left , and as it banked to the left and went across the countryside i could see underneath it			0
' it was n't an aeroplane , and it was n't a helicopter			0
certainly of a kind of - and i dread saying this - disc shape			1
it had several lights flashing all around it			0
claims : the extraordinary revelations were broadcast on @entity30 's show ( pictured ) ' underneath there were at least two large panel lights , soft white lights , and then it just sat or circled a certain area above the field for a few moments			1
' i was so gobsmacked , i was trying to negotiate the road , which was a small country lane			2
eventually i dropped down and lost sight of it but certainly for two or three minutes i saw what , i think , was not a normal aeroplane			0
' the well - respected reporter , who was flying to @entity68 for tonight 's @entity70 qualifying game between @entity71 and @entity72 , said a van driver in front of him also saw the @entity11			1
he added : ' i 'd love the person who was driving in front of me in what looked like a @entity79 silver transporter to contact the police or yourselves [ the radio station ] because they saw it as well			0
' i was wide awake and i 'm of sound mind			0
i was completely freaked out by it			0
this was a long way from @entity23 airport - at least 15 miles - and the aircraft was going westerly rather than easterly towards @entity23			1
' it was not the shape of a normal aircraft it was a big disc , round - shaped craft and it did n't leave			1
' i watched it for two or three minutes before i eventually lost sight of it			0
i decided to go back again through the village			2
it 's a very quiet area and i 've spoken to someone who knows it very well and they said there 's no military installations in that area so i would be intrigued to hear if anybody else saw it			2
' @entity11 expert @entity109 said mr @entity12 's sighting was ' absolutely fascinating ' and was ' clearly not a conventional aircraft of any type '			1
during the interview on @entity6 , which followed his sports report , he added : ' i 'm most impressed , i wish i 'd seen it myself			1
i would assume that a number of other people would have seen this object			0
' it might be extra terrestrial , it might well be one of ours			0
top secret aircraft and spacecraft have been flown by the @entity126 military and by the @entity128 military for quite some time now			2
' as @entity129 said , who developed the stealth aircraft back in 1993 in the presence of two friends of mine : " we now have the technology to go to the stars "			2
and that was back in 1993			0
' when mr @entity109 was asked to elaborate on where this technology came from , he replied : ' @entity143 crafts			0
the study of alien crafts that have been recovered and by liaising with actual aliens who have helped us develop this technology			0
