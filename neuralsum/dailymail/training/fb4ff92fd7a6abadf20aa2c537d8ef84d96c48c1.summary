by @entity0 published : 19:26 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 19:26 est , 12 december 2012 benefits clampdown : disability minister @entity2 defends change the government is to reduce or stop disability allowance for hundreds of thousands of claimants in a bid to end unchecked ‘ welfare for life ’			1
the clampdown comes as new figures suggest that seven in ten of those claiming the benefit go through the system without proper checks			1
ministers intend to reassess an initial 560,000 claimants , and expect that 330,000 – nearly 60 per cent – will get no award or a reduced sum after the checks			1
there are currently 3.2million adults claiming disability living allowance ( @entity24 ) , costing @entity25 £ 13.2billion a year – equivalent to the entire budget for the @entity27			1
the number of claimants has more than trebled since the benefit was created in 1992			1
disability minister @entity2 said without reform , one in every 17 adults would be claiming @entity24 by 2018			1
the @entity34 minister said the vast majority of claimants – 71 per cent – get the benefit ‘ for life ’ , often having filled in an initial claim form about their capability themselves			1
she added that about a third of people with a disability had a change in a condition in a year – some for the worse , but many for the better			1
this suggests that in many cases claimants may no longer need the full benefit or any allowance at all			1
the first 560,000 claimants will be reassessed by october 2015			2
the group consists of those who report a change in circumstance or who have been given a time - limited award that comes to an end			0
in a concession to critics , the government will slow down the timetable for checks on the remaining claimants , which will begin in 2015			1
it is not clear that the same proportion will see benefits reduced in the second stage as in the first			0
an independent review of the first stage of reform will be conducted in 2014			2
the government has already identified £ 630million in overpayments and £ 190million in underpayments , highlighting the turmoil in the welfare system			0
miss @entity2 said : ‘ it has been considered a static benefit , not a dynamic one			0
but there will be people getting better thanks to medical advances or who overcome an impairment			0
so we need new and more regular assessments			0
condemning : @entity90 called @entity91 the party of ' unlimited welfare ' as he faced criticism over the benefits clampdown at @entity97 's questions on wednesday ‘ @entity24 is an outdated benefit introduced over 20 years ago			1
‘ at the moment the vast majority of people get the benefit for life without systematic checks to see if their condition has changed			2
’ the @entity106 is replacing @entity24 with a new benefit , called the personal independence payment			1
it will be designed to target more generous support towards ‘ those who need it most ’			0
the new system will involve a medical expert assessing a claim in a face - to - face appointment , and regular later checks			2
last night , charities voiced a chorus of protest at plans to slash the disability benefit bill			2
a poll by campaign group @entity123 found that 9 per cent of survey respondents said losing the disability living allowance ‘ may make life not worth living ’			1
the group has also protested that the @entity76 had identified cuts in spending before consulting on which elements of benefits needed to be reformed			0
the clampdown on disability benefit emerged as the conservatives and @entity91 traded increasingly bitter blows over efforts to cut the vast welfare budget			2
challenge : labour leader @entity141 's claim that the new benefits system will lower - income families in work was disputed by @entity90 at prime minister ’s questions yesterday , @entity90 condemned @entity91 as the party of ‘ unlimited welfare ’			2
@entity141 made clear @entity91 will oppose @entity76 plans to cap most out - of - work benefits and tax credits to a below - inflation 1 per cent increase for the next three years			0
@entity91 claims that the squeeze will hit lower income families who are in work but in receipt of tax credits as well as the unemployed , but the prime minister insisted that such concern is misplaced			0
working families would be more than compensated by other measures , most notably , a record increase in the basic rate income tax threshold to £ 9,440 , mr @entity90 said			0
officials say the average working family would be £ 125 a year better off next year once the income tax break , the tax credit squeeze and the cancellation of a 3p rise in fuel duty are taken into account			0
savings from the welfare cap are so significant that it would take a 1p rise income tax to plug the gap			0
mr @entity141 accused the government of seeking to ‘ divide and rule ’ , by portraying benefit claimants as ‘ scroungers ’ .			0

new figures show 71 per cent of claimants do not go through proper checks
without reform , one in every 17 adults would be claiming @entity24 by 2018 says disability minister
