it ’s every girl ’s dream to look beautiful on her wedding day			1
but a botched nose job left one woman feeling ‘ more like a boxer than a bride ’ - and considering cancelling her big day entirely			1
@entity7 , 34 , from @entity8 , nicknamed ' @entity9 ' by school bullies had her first nose job at the age of 25			1
but when the operation went wrong , she was left with a nose that she said looked ' worse than before '			2
after being bullied for her nose ( left ) @entity7 , 34 , from @entity8 underwent four nose jobs to achieve the look she wanted for her wedding day ( right ) a non-surgical nose filler treatment she found online 16 weeks before her wedding day finally restored her confidence and allowed her to walk down the aisle to marry her partner , @entity24 , with pride two correction surgeries failed , leaving her nose too weak for further operations			1
but when her boyfriend @entity24 proposed , and the couple set a date for their wedding , mrs @entity7 's anxieties took over			1
she contemplated banning cameras , or cancelling their big day altogether			1
after researching treatments on the internet , mrs @entity7 discovered a non-surgical nose job 16 weeks before her wedding day			1
it restored the shape she wanted and gave her the confidence to walk down the aisle			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ there was no way i could have married with my nose the way it was			1
it looked awful and i was far too self - conscious about it			0
‘ i felt i looked like a boxer with an odd shaped nose after too many fights			2
‘ at one point i thought i would have to cancel the wedding but thank goodness the new surgery worked and my nose looked normal again just in time			1
‘ it ’s taken four procedures but i ’m finally happy with the way it looks			2
’ mrs @entity7 ’s confidence was left left shattered after years of childhood bullying , her peers targeting her nose			1
nicknamed ‘ @entity9 ’ after the character in @entity64 , she avoided being pictured side on and longed for the day she could afford cosmetic surgery			2
before her first nose job , a surgeon showed mrs @entity7 a photoshopped image of what her nose would look like after the operation ( left ) - but the reality was so different it left her wanting to cancel her wedding ( right ) a month after her first nose job , mrs @entity7 was not happy with the result and underwent a further two corrective surgeries and eventually a non-surgical filler treatment when she was 25 she gained access to some inheritance held in trust since she was eight			1
at £ 3,500 it was just enough for a nose job			1
in march 2005 , she met a surgeon who agreed to straighten the nose and remove the bump			2
she was shown a photoshopped image of how she would look post-surgery and loved the result			2
she underwent the procedure in may 2005 but it was another two weeks before she got to see her new nose			1
mrs @entity7 said that after her first nose job and two failed corrective procedures her nose looked like a ' plastic comedy one ' but when she finally looked in a mirror , it was a shock			1
despite hating what she saw , her surgeon assured her it would settle in time			0
however , a month later mrs @entity7 noticed the bridge of her nose was getting wider			1
by march 2006 , her surgeon confirmed that the bone down the centre of her nose had n’t fused properly and was in fact separating			0
he offered to perform corrective surgery , but once again mrs @entity7 was left feeling disappointed with the results			1
her nose looked worse than before , despite the corrective surgery			2
she said : ‘ i could n’t see any improvement to the bridge and the tip and nostrils looked strangely pointed			0
‘ i knew it looked worse than it had before and my confidence plummeted			0
’ to make herself feel better she agreed to a holiday with friends			0
it was there she met her future husband @entity24			0
she said : ‘ i immediately told him i ’d had surgery that had gone wrong and wanted to get it sorted			0
he told me i looked great but i knew i would n’t be happy unless it was fixed			0
’ after returning , her surgeon agreed to break and resent her nose for a second time			2
two weeks later she was horrified to see the bridge now appeared too small for the tip. @entity128 , she parted ways with the surgeon and instead went to her gp , but after three failed operations he warned her it was unlikely she would find anyone willing to operate			0
mrs @entity7 then had no choice but to resort to using make up techniques to try and disguise her nose			1
she said : ‘ i tried to focus on my future and forget about it but it still affected my confidence every day and i avoided cameras as much as i could			0
’ in 2010 , her partner proposed and soon after the couple had their first baby , a son @entity144			0
after @entity144 ’ birth the couple decided to set a date for the wedding , and decided on the august 12 , 2012			2
initially mrs @entity7 was excited			1
but that excitement turned to dread when she started thinking about the photographs , and all the guests seeing the nose that she hated			0
she said : ‘ it was only after i had booked a venue and paid the deposit that i started thinking about wedding photography			0
‘ i started to panic about my nose and trying to think of ways around the problem			0
’ she even considered banning cameras from the wedding			2
she said : ‘ i thought if we could just have the professional photographer than then there was no risk of anyone taking a side profile picture of me			0
‘ i knew i ’d sound awful and ridiculous though			0
i even considered photo - shopping all the wedding pictures or cancelling it all together			2
’ but while researching botched nose jobs online she stumbled across a new treatment that reshaped noses using fillers – without needing surgery			2
there was one problem , the clinic was in @entity180			0
so mrs @entity7 started searching for a clinic in the @entity182 and found a company that offered the treatment			1
with just 16 weeks before her big day she contacted @entity184 , and saw a consultant			1
he agreed her nose job was the worst he had ever seen , but was confident that he could use an injectable solution to restore the shape before the wedding			1
despite anxieties about her nose leading her to consider cancelling her big day , mrs @entity7 said she felt ' amazing ' in her dress and actually enjoyed being photographed on her wedding day after the first round of fillers she burst into tears of joy			1
‘ i finally looked like i had a normal nose			0
it was how i wanted to look after the first operation all those years back			0
two weeks later , after another procedure , she was ready for her big day			1
for the first time in years , she enjoyed being photographed			2
she said : ‘ i felt amazing in my dress			0
as the photographer clicked away i enjoyed every minute			0
‘ i felt like a real bride and not a boxer			0
’ mrs @entity7 is now due to have another round of fillers and has decided to share her story to make others aware this type of non-surgical treatment is available			1
she said : ‘ if only i ’d known about it before i would n’t have wasted so many years hating my appearance			0
