by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 the mother of a disabled girl who died at the age of 11 is suing for compensation , claiming doctors had failed to warn her that she could be born handicapped			1
@entity8 says she ‘ did n’t want a damaged child ’ and would have terminated her pregnancy if she had been told her baby had a one - in - 13 chance of being seriously abnormal			2
her daughter @entity13 had an extremely rare chromosomal disorder which left her nearly blind and in ‘ almost constant pain ’			1
on her first birthday : @entity13 ( centre ) , whose parents were social workers @entity19 ( right ) and @entity20 ( left ) , lived a life of almost constant pain from birth to death she died in 2009 , but miss @entity8 and her partner @entity20 told a court they would ‘ almost certainly ’ have asked for an abortion if they had been fully informed of the risks			1
they have now made a claim for £ 500,000 to compensate them for the damage done to their lives and their careers – and to make up for the cost of raising their daughter			2
giving evidence @entity38 , from @entity40 , told the @entity41 that her life had changed from the minute @entity43 was born			1
she said : ‘ she was in constant pain , screaming and crying			1
our life stopped to look after her			1
‘ i did nothing else but look after her			2
we had to catheterise her and feed her and give her medication day and night			2
@entity13 had an extremely rare chromosomal disorder which left her nearly blind and in ' almost constant pain ' miss @entity8 and her partner were both social workers who were used to working with disabled people ‘ she was constantly being sick , so would need to be changed			1
a vast amount of her life was spent in hospital			1
lots of times she was incubated , in intensive care			2
‘ we saw the country by hospital – @entity67 , @entity65 , @entity66			2
my whole focus while @entity43 was alive was to look after her			0
’ miss @entity8 and her partner were both social workers who were used to working with disabled people			0
in 2001 they tried to sue @entity70 for ‘ wrongful birth ’			0
however after a meeting that year with a group of experts , who said they thought the claim was unlikely to succeed , their legal team told them that they should abandon the case			0
social workers : @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) , both pictured outside the @entity41 in @entity83 , have split up			0
they are suing a leading law firm and barrister for alleged professional negligence @entity43 ’s parents , both 45 , are no longer together – but they are suing law firm @entity88 and a barrister called @entity90 for alleged professional negligence			1
their new counsel @entity91 said the couple had indicated to hospital staff that they would have no hesitation in going through with an abortion if there was a risk of serious disability			0
at 11 weeks pregnant , miss @entity8 had a routine nuchal translucency scan , which tests for chromosomal conditions			1
she was told there was increased fluid under the baby ’s skin , at the back of her neck , but that it was a ‘ soft marker ’ for possible problems			0
however the parents were not told that when cross-referenced with other factors , the results actually showed a one - in - 13 risk of the rare chromosomal abnormality , trisomy , he said			1
doctors also failed to carry out amniocentesis and cardiocentesis tests when she was 15 and 20 weeks pregnant , which would have flagged up the condition			1
miss @entity8 , from @entity40 , told the @entity41 that her life had changed from the minute @entity43 was born mr @entity123 claimed that barrister @entity90 and solicitor @entity124 had taken ‘ their eyes off the ball ’ when handling the case			1
he said the lawyers ignored the fact that important tests had not been carried out			0
he also said they had ignored the parents ’ determination not to have a disabled child when they told them to abandon the case			2
this meant they had missed their chance of receiving compensation from the @entity145 for the damage to their careers , the cost of looking after a severely disabled child and the emotional harm to @entity141 , the court heard			0
mr @entity123 added : ‘ we say it is indefensible that she did not get information , advice , or further testing in the form of amniocentesis or cardiocentesis			0
‘ we would invite a finding of fact that @entity8 made it plain to the doctors and the ancillary staff that she did n’t want a damaged child			2
‘ if there was a risk that there was going to be an abnormality then , dependent on the level of that risk , she would have terminated			0
‘ if there was a confirmation through scanning , then she would most certainly have terminated the pregnancy			0
‘ we say that , in so far as the claim against the hospital is concerned , nothing could be clearer			0
’ he added : ‘ in those circumstances , we could not get a more compelling case where there was a breach of duty			0
’ denying negligence , solicitors from @entity88 insisted that the experts had been given all the facts on which to base their opinion on whether the claim had a chance of success			2
the firm are arguing that the parents ’ claim against them was launched too late			1
allegations : @entity70 , as it appears today they have also said that mr @entity20 was not one of their clients , and that the lawyers did not owe him a duty of care			0
the judge , mr @entity200 , has decided to reserve his judgment until a later date			0
‘ wrongful birth ’ claims are made on the grounds that a hospital has failed to discover abnormalities in good time , depriving parents of the chance to consider having an abortion			1
in the past , parents of other disabled children have managed to successfully argue that medical negligence denied them an opportunity to terminate the pregnancy before the 24 - week legal limit			1
‘ @entity220 birth ’ claims have cost the @entity145 around £ 54million over the past five years .			0

@entity13 lived life of almost constant pain until death
born with an extremely rare chromosomal disorder , with near blindness
