by @entity0 published : 22:25 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 06:57 est , 6 november 2013 a new £ 2 million sewage treatment plant is turning our waste into a sustainable source of environmentally - friendly fertiliser that experts claim could help secure future global food supplies			1
the nutrient - recovery reactor , the first of its kind in @entity11 , is producing high - grade phosphorus - based fertiliser from the ' unique ' waste water coming out of @entity15 , @entity16			1
@entity17 is a key ingredient in fertiliser and vital for the growth of crops but its cost has increased by 500 per cent since 2007 as the availability of mined phosphate rock dwindles from non-renewable reserves			1
a @entity27 spokesman said the @entity28 uses 138,000 tonnes of phosphate fertiliser a year , all of which is imported from abroad			1
but the new reactor will produce 150 tonnes of its phosphate fertiliser - which the company has described as ' @entity35 for plants ' - every year			1
new technology : the new £ 2million sewage treatment facility in @entity15 , @entity16 , which provides a sustainable source of environmentally - friendly phosphate - based fertiliser @entity27 believes the fertiliser could help boost crop production and secure future global food supplies			1
the spokesman said : ' mineable reserves of phosphorus , in countries like @entity49 , the @entity50 and @entity51 , are set to be completely depleted in 100 years , according to some experts , while others say " peak phosphorus " will occur as early as the mid- 2030s , after which it is expected to become increasingly scarce and expensive			0
' this adds to the costs , not to mention the reliance on external sources for such a vital resource , which is used to produce all food consumed by human beings			2
' @entity64 , policy director at the @entity65 , said : ' with the world 's affordable mineable reserves of phosphorus set to start running out in the next 20 to 30 years , this new technology could offer a solution to securing global food supplies over the coming decades			0
' without fertilisation from phosphorus , wheat crop yields will fall by more than half			0
meanwhile , as the planet 's population is predicted to hit nine billion by 2050 , demand for food will increase			0
' sustainable alternative sources of phosphorus , like this reactor at @entity15 sewage works , are vital if we are to keep pace with this demand			1
' the water company spokesman said nutrient - recovery facilities are ideally suited to industrialised areas such as @entity15			1
he said the high - strength organic waste coming from the @entity90 , immortalised in the @entity92 television series @entity93 , was rich in the nutrients ammonia and phosphorous			2
in demand : the new plant is expected to produce 150 tonnes of phosphorus - based fertiliser every year he said this causes struvite , which is a rock - like scale on pipes at the sewage works costing @entity27 £ 200,000 a year to clean			1
the facility , built by @entity106 - based @entity105 , makes the phosphorus form into struvite in a controlled setting , before turning it into crystalline fertiliser pellets			2
the company markets this under the brand name @entity115 , which it says is cleaner than any similar product on the market with lower heavy metal content			0
the spokesman said : ' the new reactor will also improve the quality of treated effluent leaving the sewage works , reducing nutrient levels and in turn reducing algae growth in rivers and streams , which can suck oxygen out of watercourses leaving little for fish and other wildlife			2
' @entity134 , commercial director for @entity27 , said : ' this is a classic win - win			0
we are producing eco-friendly steroids for plants , while also tackling the costly problem of struvite fouling up pipes at our works			0
' the cash and carbon cost of digging phosphate out of the ground in a far - flung foreign clime then shipping it back to @entity28 makes no sense when compared to the local , sustainable process of our reactor in @entity15			1
' as we gain experience with this new technology , we intend to evaluate its suitability for installation at other @entity27 plants in the @entity28			0
' he added : ' @entity15 has taken some stick over the years , from the likes of poet @entity160 and @entity161 , but this scheme is rebranding it as an eco-warrior at the forefront of the global effort to save the planet			0
' @entity167 , president and chief executive of @entity105 , said : ' this new facility is a model for sustainable innovation in the @entity28 and indeed across @entity11			2
' removing nutrients from where they should n't be - in our waterways - and using them to create a new generation of enhanced - efficiency fertiliser is the smart thing to do economically and the right thing to do environmentally			0

the nutrient - recovery reactor , a first of its kind in @entity11 , is based in @entity15
it uses sewage to produce a high - grade phosphorus - based fertiliser
@entity17 is a key ingredient in fertiliser and vital for the growth of crops
the @entity28 currently imports all its phosphate fertiliser - 138,000 tonnes a year
the new plant will offer a renewable source of phosphate fertiliser in @entity28
