flu jabs can halve the risk of heart attacks in middle - aged men , according to a study			1
the vaccine is already given to people with chronic conditions , including heart disease			0
but researchers say the @entity10 should consider offering it to everyone from 50 to 64			1
the study examined hospital data for 559 patients over the age of 40 , around half of whom had suffered a heart attack			0
benefits : the flu vaccine could help cut the risk of a heart attack in middle - aged men by up to a half nose and throat swabs and blood samples were taken when the patients were admitted and again four to six weeks later			1
the results showed around one in eight of the heart attack patients had recently had flu , compared with just under 7 per cent in the comparison group			1
half of all the patients had received the flu jab that year			1
flu had not been diagnosed in around one in ten of those who had the infection , suggesting it may be missed in hospital patients who turn up with other problems , the @entity36 experts reported in the journal @entity43			2
while the research showed that flu did not increase the risk of a heart attack , having the jab appeared to be protective			2
it cut the chance of having an attack by 45 per cent			0
deadly : previous research has suggested that the flu virus can cause blood to thicken or arteries to inflame previous research has shown that flu may encourage blood to thicken or prompt an inflammatory response in arteries that are already narrowed , which could lead to a blockage and a heart attack			1
but the report authors , from the @entity62 in @entity63 , said : ‘ even a small effect of influenza vaccination in preventing ( heart attacks ) may have significant population health gains			0
’ @entity68 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity69 , said : ‘ the flu can lead to serious illness , so getting your flu jab is vital if you have , or are at risk of , heart disease			2
it ’s why many heart patients who are deemed at high risk are already offered the vaccination as a matter of routine			0
’ dr @entity84 , head of the respiratory diseases department at @entity86 , said : ‘ we welcome this interesting research on the flu vaccination ’s effects			0
‘ the study results are a timely reminder that susceptible patients should have their flu jab this winter			0

researchers say @entity10 should consider giving it to everyone aged 50 to 64
previous studies have found flu can cause blood to thicken
