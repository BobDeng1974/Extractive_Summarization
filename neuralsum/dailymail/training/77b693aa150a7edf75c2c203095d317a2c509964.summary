the new treatment could significantly boost older people ’s ability to fight off flu and other viruses a treatment which significantly boosts older people ’s ability to fight off flu and other viruses has been developed by @entity9 scientists			1
once injected with the new chemical , the elderly and vulnerable will have a much for effective immune system , @entity11 researchers claim			1
they say the drug could give a 90 - year - old patient the immune system of someone in their 20s			1
if the treatment performs well in clinical trials , it could severely reduce a niggling public health problem which costs the @entity25 millions each year			0
@entity26 kills 5,000 people in @entity28 annually - the vast majority of them elderly or with existing respiratory conditions			2
part of the problem is that the elderly do not react as well as the young to vaccines			2
the newly - discovered drug promises to boost the power of the flu jab , holding the potential to significantly reduce the danger of common viruses to older people			1
the compound , called spermidine , has been shown to have a significant impact in tests on mice - and scientists have already patented it as a potential treatment for humans			1
each year three - quarters of those aged 65 and over take up the offer to get a flu jab free on the @entity25			1
the policy is the health service ’s main tool against the infection – but the benefits of vaccinating pensioners have been seriously questioned in recent years with critics saying there are no figures to back up claims that lives are being saved			0
this new chemical could solve that problem , the researchers say			0
it could be mixed in with an existing vaccines or be delivered as a separate jab or a tablet			2
the research , published yesterday in the journal @entity73 , showed that the compound restores the immune system ’s inbuilt ‘ memory ’ enabling it to mount a more powerful protective response following vaccination			1
tests have shown the chemical can boost the response of mice to the flu virus and cytomegalovirus – or @entity86 – a common infection which can cause sight problems and pneumonia			1
the scientists think it might be used to tackle a wider variety of viruses in future			0
the newly - discovered drug , which contains a compound called spermidine , promises to boost the power of the flu jab , holding the potential to significantly reduce the danger of common viruses ( such as flu , pictured ) to older people study leader professor @entity105 said : ‘ viral infections like flu are unpleasant for most people , but can be very serious for the over- 65s and vaccines , like the free annual flu jab , are the best form of protection			1
‘ our aim is to make that protection even better , by adding immune boosting compounds to routine vaccinations			0
’ scientists think vaccines lose effectiveness in older people because as we age , our immune system loses its ‘ memory ’			1
it becomes less effective at recognising infections , including those we have had in the past and those we have been vaccinated against			0
the scientists say their aim is to make protection from viruses even better , by adding immune boosting compounds to routine vaccinations a key factor is that the white blood cells that coordinate the response to an infection – called t cells – lose the ability to form a ‘ memory ’ of the infection			2
therefore when elderly people encounter a virus they are unable to mount a strong immune response and can develop a serious , even fatal , infection			1
the new breakthrough rests on the researchers ’ discovery of the key cellular process essential for the formation of immune memory			0
they showed that this process becomes defective in immune cells with age , helping to explain why immunity diminishes over time			0
by targeting this process with spermidine , the scientists managed to restore immune memory , boosting the effectiveness of a vaccine			2
@entity159 , who co-authored the research , said of the drug : ‘ it ’s the equivalent of a 90 year old responding to a vaccine better than a 20 year old , which makes this a very exciting pathway to target as a potential way of boosting vaccine protection in the elderly			2
’ @entity170 works by enhancing a normal cellular process called autophagy , where parts of the cell that have become defective or damaged are broken down and destroyed within cells			0
the researchers found that mice lacking a gene important for autophagy could n’t make memory t cells when given the flu vaccine			0
they also saw that levels of autophagy were lowered in t cells from aged mice , suggesting that autophagy is a vital part of forming the immune memory into old age			0
when aged mice were given spermidine prior to flu vaccination , their t cell response was enhanced dramatically			2
the researchers have patented spermidine and will now see if they can use the compound , or other autophagy - enhancing drugs , to improve responses to already licensed vaccines in mice before hopefully moving on to early safety trials in humans			1
professor @entity202 added : ‘ we think that spermidine could be particularly useful alongside many of the vaccines currently in development that protect against other viruses			0
‘ however , we expect it to be at least five to ten years before a drug reaches the clinic			0

elderly people do not react as well as to vaccines as young people do
