and when their hectic schedule gets too much , well , they fall asleep right where they are			0
in the case of these exhausted pandas , that means perched precariously in a tree			2
this giant panda is fast asleep perched in the branches of a tree in @entity18 , @entity19 province these adorable photographs show the giant pandas fast asleep amongst the branches of trees in the @entity18 in @entity24 , southwest @entity26 's @entity19 province			1
how they managed not to fall out is perhaps a secret known only to pandas , but there 's no doubt they looks pretty relaxed as they catch up on their sleep			2
giant pandas live in temperate - zone bamboo forests in central @entity26 , in mountain ranges in @entity26 's @entity19 , @entity38 , and @entity40 regions			1
their thick black and white fur coat keeps them warm in the cool forests			2
one of the rarest animals in the world - there are only around 1,000 left in the wild and 140 in zoos and breeding centres - they have come to symbolize animal conservation efforts			0
their diet is 99 per cent bamboo , but they also eat grasses , small rodents or even musk deer fawns			0
they have large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles to crush the bamboo			0
while they look like large teddy bears , they are considered as dangerous as any other bear			0
just dropped off : these pandas look shattered as they catch up on some sleep perched high up in the forest out for the count : this sleeping giant panda could n't look more comfortable if he were in a feather bed			1
