a chocolate - mad mum has lost a staggering 10 stone after realising she looked just like a character from @entity4			2
@entity5 , was left red - faced when she saw a picture of herself looking exactly like the bloated blueberry character @entity8 , the greedy girl who swelled to the size of a giant blueberry after scoffing forbidden confectionery			1
the 36 - year - old , from @entity13 , @entity14 , tipped the scales at 21st 10lbs but is now nearly half her size after ditching her diet of chocolate bars , sausage rolls and pasties for healthier options			1
she said : ' i loved chocolate bars up until i saw a picture of myself and was horrified			0
i looked like the swollen blueberry girl from @entity4 and that 's when i knew i had to lose weight			0
' @entity5 adds : ' before , i 'd tried every diet that you could think of including a soup diet and even one where you eat nothing but eggs			1
' i would be eating scrambled eggs , egg and grapefruit , eggs on toast ... but it really did n't work for me			0
' with all the diets i tried , i always found myself hungry and would slip back into old habits and before i knew it i 'd put on weight again			1
unearthing a new confidence : @entity5 had begun to shun family parties for fear of people telling her how much weight she had gained ( left ) and ( right ) @entity5 's new , slender look came after she finally found a diet that worked for her @entity5 ( far right ) began to hate comparisons with her mum ( far left ) who has always been a larger lady the weight became such an issue that @entity5 says she no longer felt ' comfortable in my own skin ' and stopped going to family parties			1
' when i missed my @entity71 's 80th birthday i felt dreadful , but i was sick of people saying i 'd put on weight and that i looked like my mum , who was a big woman			1
' it was a vicious cycle - the more depressed i was about my weight , the more food i ate			0
' @entity5 was nominated as @entity36 's @entity78 for her local club in @entity14 and was shortlisted in their finals of 55 women			1
before losing weight @entity5 would often joke with friends about her size , especially for having to order @entity86 t - shirts and shop at specialist stores for larger people			1
but now , at half the woman she used to be , she 's barely recognisable			0
in her first week of dieting , @entity5 lost seven pounds and seven days later had lost a stone after making her @entity93 to lose weight			2
@entity95 cut back on her beloved chocolate and saw her weight plummet down to 11 stone from then - january 2012 - she continued to battle the bulge and got down to her 11 stone target weight			0
doctors told @entity5 that if she did n't lose weight she 'd have to be put on blood pressure tablets at the age of 34			1
@entity5 said : ' i was really overweight , i 'd eat a whole eight pack of sausages in one sitting			1
' my ankles would swell when i walked , so would my knees and when i bent over i 'd struggle to breathe			0
' what stopped me before was the thought that i 'd be the biggest person in the room but everyone 's lovely and supportive , we all help each other lose weight			2
' now i feel so much happier in myself , i look great and nothing 's holding me back			0
the mum of one ditched processed food and now has an extensive selection of foods that she can cook as part of her weight loss range			0
@entity5 on holiday with her partner after losing the weight , she says the diet has left her feeling ' like a different woman ' with a new lease of life she said : ' the great thing is i can eat anything i just have to tweak recipes to make it leaner and cook it without fat			2
' before i 'd use so much oil when cooking , i 'd have sugars in my coffee it 's no wonder i put all the weight on			1
' now i prefer a healthier option and feel so great for it , it tastes delicious and is good for me			0
' since losing weight i 've been telling everyone - friends , family , anyone i could find that @entity36 truly helped me			2
' i feel like a completely different woman now my @entity152 is now 26 which is great and i have so much energy			0
' although my husband 's told me he 'd love me whatever weight i was but personally i feel so much happier and i have much more energy			1
' now i 'm not afraid to go to any family parties i 'm now showing off my new figure			0
' i 'll never hide away from social occasions again , i feel good having my picture taken again now and we can start filling our family albums with pictures			0
