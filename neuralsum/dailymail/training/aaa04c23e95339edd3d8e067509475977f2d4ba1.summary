but now scientists are using advanced 3d scanning technology to digitally document much - loved landmarks in a bid to preserve them on computers for generations to come			1
a new organisation intends to preserve 500 cultural sites digitally over the next five years and build a 3d - digital library of the world 's most important monuments			1
scientists are using advanced 3d scanning technology to digitally document much - loved landmarks including @entity26 ( pictured ) in a bid to preserve them on computers for generations to come unlike precious artefacts that are carefully preserved in museums , sites such as the @entity3 pyramids , @entity26 and the ruins of @entity33 , are open to the elements and are being slowly eroded			1
increasing numbers of tourists visiting the famous sites can also accidentally cause damage to them , leading a new charitable organisation to try and preserve selected locations			2
launched today at the @entity46 , @entity45 's ' @entity44 ' is a mission to save cultural heritage sites across the globe before they are ravaged by war or terrorism , affected by climate change , earthquakes or floods or fall victim to sprawling cities			1
mapping the sites is a laborious process			0
here , abseilers map @entity26 , which forms one of the 40 heritage sites mapped and collected by the organisation so far @entity45 intends to preserve 500 cultural sites digitally over the next five years and build a 3d - digital library of the world 's most important sites			1
this is a scan of @entity68 in @entity69 that dates from 600 ad			0
the precious pyramid is visited by 1.2 million tourists every year the project uses @entity74 laser scanning and other reality - capture technologies to create digital models of sites , such as this ancient @entity78 in @entity33 , that are accurate to just two to six millimeters			2
this level of detail preserves delicate works of art such as mosaic floor ( pictured ) @entity84 , co-founder of @entity45 , based in @entity85 , said : ' our mission is to create a 3d - digital library of the world ’s most important heritage sites			1
' while there is n’t enough time or money to save all these sites physically , we have the technology to digitally preserve them			1
' by doing so , we will ensure that these treasures are available for appreciation and study for years to come			0
it ’s not an option ; it ’s our responsibility			0

pictured is the scan of the remarkable @entity114 in @entity115 ' otherwise , we will lose our shared history and an important piece of our cultural identity			0
' @entity45 has already mapped 40 sites , including @entity120 , the @entity121 , the @entity122 and the @entity46			1
the project uses @entity74 laser scanning and other reality - capture technologies to create digital models of the sites that are accurate to just two to six millimeters , enabling details to be captured that could otherwise be damaged by weathering			2
this scan of the @entity1 shows just how precarious the monument is			0
the organisation is scanning 500 landmarks to make sure they are available to study for years to come and sees its as a responsibility in each mapping exercise , experts capture billions of data points and as much as 10 terbytes of information			2
using the data collected , @entity45 develops tools to help conservators in managing and preserving locations , that can be a magnet for tourists , as well as letting researchers and members of the public have access to the maps via its website			2
the data collected from each project is stored in an underground bunker in western @entity156 by a company called @entity158 , alongside other priceless collections including musical recordings from @entity163 / @entity162 musicians such as @entity164 and @entity165 and films like @entity167 and @entity168 from @entity169			0
the organisation today launched the @entity171 to enable governments and individuals to nominate sites for preservation and donate money to support the cause			0
sites worthy of scanning will be chosen by a council of international heritage experts , chaired by @entity182 , president of the @entity183			1
he said : ' the first task of the @entity186 was to develop criteria for selecting the 500			0
' while the risk factor will be a chief criterion in selecting sites , we want to use the technology beyond mere documentation to promote capacity building in all regions , and to assist management in periodic monitoring , interpretation , public awareness , and promotion of visitation			2
' in each mapping exercise , such as this colonnade in @entity33 , experts capture billions of data points and as much as 10 terbytes of information			0

@entity45 wants to preserve 500 cultural sites digitally over the next five years
