by @entity0 published : 12:54 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 05:47 est , 4 october 2012 it takes a vivid imagination to place the @entity4 ’s enigmatic smile on this skull – but archaeologists are convinced they can			1
they believe a skeleton unearthed in @entity8 could have belonged to the woman painted by @entity10 in his masterpiece			1
archaeologists who are digging for the remains of the real - life @entity4 have found two new female skeletons			1
the two bodies , one whole , the other fragmented , were found in the same grave in the basement of the former convent of @entity21			0
researchers digging in @entity8 have discovered two new female skeletons in the search for the @entity4			1
it is thought that the alleged ' model ' for @entity10 's @entity4 , @entity26 , was buried there after his death in 1542			1
yesterday 's discovery brings the total number of skeletons found to seven			0
' if everything goes as planned , we will find @entity26 and with her skull we will be able to reconstruct her face thanks to some sophisticated technology , ' mr @entity32 said yesterday			1
' after that we will be able to compare the face to that of @entity4 and maybe for the first time will get an answer that will be based on highly sophisticated technology that does not make errors , ' he told @entity44			1
' with this reconstruction of the face there is a margin of error between four and eight per cent so we will know whether @entity10 used @entity26 or we will be able to draw other conclusions			1
' however , one of @entity26 's descendants , the @entity53 aristocrat @entity52 , has described the researchers ' grave - digging project as a ' sacrilegious act '			2
' what difference would finding her remains make to the allure of @entity10 's painting ? ' she said recently			1
however , even if the skeletons are not the @entity4 , the team has vowed to keep digging			1
bodies were buried one on top of the other at the convent - so the team will keep digging , and reaching further back in history			2
the latest discovery comes amid renewed interest in the painting after the @entity76 - based @entity75 unveiled what is known as the ' @entity78 ' to the public , and said mathematical analysis proved it was the hand of the master at work			0
but other experts remain unconvinced , with @entity85 professor @entity84 telling the @entity86 there is ' no basis for thinking that there was an earlier portrait '			0
the latest discovery is of two skeletons , believed to be female , laying next to other			0
archaeologists have vowed to keep digging at the site , which contains dozens of bodies on top of each other			0
so far , seven skeletons have been found			0
@entity32 recently found the body of a wealthy woman			0
' the ledgers kept by the nuns of this convent tell us that , presumably , the remains are those of @entity106 , a wealthy woman who ( died ) in 1609 , ' he told reporters when the discovery was made			2
but he added that he hoped ' @entity4 's ' bones ' could be right here '			1
@entity111 , was the wife of a rich silk merchant named @entity113			0
in @entity53 the @entity4 is known as @entity4			0
the face of @entity10 's " @entity4 " taken on april 5 , 2005 in @entity116 ' @entity115 ( @entity117 ) and the same detail of a picture released by the @entity75 of what is believed to be an earlier version of @entity10 's masterpiece			1
most modern historians agree that the lady depicted in the @entity4 was @entity113 , who became a nun after her husband 's death			2
she died in the convent on july 15 , 1542 , aged 63			0
an archeological team began digging at the abandoned convent of @entity21 last year			2
they first had to dig through thick concrete , laid down ahead of plans to turn the convent into an army barracks			0
if they do find the body of @entity26 , the team hopes to extract her dna to confirm her identity - comparing it to the dna of her two children buried elsewhere			0
then they will use facial reconstruction techniques to compare her face to that of the iconic painting			0
however some researchers have criticised the research , saying the pace of the expedition means error may be made - such as the team not mapping out where bones and other items are found , ruining evidence such as the spatial relationships between different bodies			2
an archeologist works next to one of the two new skeletons found today during the ' hunt ' of the remains of the alleged ' model ' for @entity10 's @entity4 , @entity165			1
@entity167 quoted @entity169 anthropologist @entity168 , who said : ' although the excavation is being carried out in a professional manner , @entity32 ’s quest to dig up the ' real ' @entity4 is not grounded in scientific research methodology			2
' the news media ’s breathless coverage of it threatens to signal to the public that archaeologists are frivolous with their time , energy and research money			0
' the convent was the burial site of @entity26 , wife of the wealthy @entity8 silk merchant @entity113 , who modelled for @entity10 resting place : the courtyard of the @entity21 convent in @entity8 , where archaeologists have been digging			1

research team aims to keep digging *beneath* convent in central @entity8 in hopes of finding @entity10 's muse
researchers plan to reconstruct @entity4 's face from her skull if remains are identified
