read @entity1 's report from @entity2 @entity3 has admitted he is feeling the heat following @entity6 ’s fifth consecutive defeat on saturday			1
after his side lost 31 - 28 to @entity8 at @entity2 , @entity3 conceded : ‘ clearly the pressure is on because we ’ve not achieved our objectives			1
’ but despite @entity6 ’s woeful form , their head coach was still trying to be positive about their performances			1
@entity6 coach @entity3 admits the pressure is on his team after they suffered their fifth straight loss @entity8 came out on top 31 - 28 at @entity2 on saturday to inflict another defeat on @entity6 ‘ we ’ve had five games against the top two sides in the world and we ’ve not been smashed in any of them , ’ he said			1
‘ in a lot of ways we ’ve been reasonably dominant against them			0
‘ internally there ’s a very strong group working hard together and there ’s no sense of the pressure affecting people			2
’ nevertheless , @entity6 are poised to make changes for the third @entity35 against @entity36 in five days ’ time , with a leading source of concern being the form of fly - half @entity40			1
there will be a potentially ‘ nasty ’ review today before urgent steps are taken to rectify the glaring deficiencies which are undermining their build - up to next year ’s home @entity47			0
@entity6 captain @entity49 looked devastated after the final whistle as @entity6 were beaten again @entity6 's @entity8 loss comes a week after their defeat by @entity53 and 11 months before @entity47 flanker @entity54 said that @entity6 need to keep on plugging away with the @entity47 coming up @entity3 said : ‘ i do n’t think any team stops developing or learning but the clock ultimately stops at the @entity47			1
you also know that if you do n’t win in the short term , while also trying to develop the side in the long term , then pressure can be caused by not winning consistently			2
’ flanker @entity54 added : ‘ we understand we will come under a lot of pressure now			0
everyone relates everything to the @entity47 and puts it in that context and we just have to stay tight , keep plugging on and make sure we keep doing the basics well and preparing as well as we can			0
’ there have been widespread calls for @entity40 to be dropped in the light of his poor form and the fact that he appeared to be in considerable discomfort on saturday			0
but @entity3 said : ‘ we have a lot of faith in @entity40 as a player and as a person			2
we ’ll be sticking by him			0
