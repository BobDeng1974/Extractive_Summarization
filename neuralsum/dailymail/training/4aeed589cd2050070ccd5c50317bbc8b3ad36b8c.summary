by @entity0 @entity1 believes an @entity3 comeback for @entity4 is a non-starter because captain @entity6 ' ca n't handle ' him			1
@entity4 's colourful international career was effectively ended in february when the @entity8 dropped its record run - scorer and effectively sacked him from his central contract			1
entrenched opinions on both sides mean reconciliation is highly unlikely , while the publication of @entity4 's eagerly anticipated autobiography next month , when a mutually agreed confidentiality clause expires , should settle the matter once and for all			2
@entity4 is unlikely to return for @entity3 while @entity6 is still captain @entity3 's record run taker ( r ) , playing here for @entity21 , was effectively sacked in february boycott , himself a former @entity3 skiper , agrees there is no way back but suggests one of the key reasons is an inability from @entity6 to manage his one - time star batsman			1
@entity1 told @entity30 : ' they wo n't consider him again , they wo n't go back			0
whether that 's right or wrong i dont know but they 're not going to go back , they 've made a decision			0
' too many people just feel we do n't need it , we do n't need the difficulty			0
' they know they have enough problems , they do n't want any more problems			0
' keeping somebody like @entity48 , who can give you match - winning performances but can give you headaches , you need a captain who can handle that			0
cricket legend @entity1 claims @entity6 does not know how to handle @entity4 ' i 'm almost sure in my own mind the current captain ca n't			1
@entity6 's a nice lad , you could n't say anything bad about him ... but i do n't think he can handle someone like @entity4			2
' it takes a strong personality and i do n't think he is			0
' ( he 's ) strong in batting , not strong in handling people			0
' @entity1 's fellow @entity62 commentator @entity61 had a trouble - free relationship with @entity4 when he captained @entity3			1
boycott believes that former captain @entity61 ( r ) would have dealt with @entity4 better that may have been down to getting the player at the right stage of his career , but @entity1 believes he would have dealt with @entity4 better than his latter - day predecessors			1
' @entity61 got him at the beginning of his career , it was was much easier because he had n't become such a big figure in cricket , ' added @entity1			2
' @entity61 , if he 'd have been captain later on when @entity4 became a star , i think would have handled him better because he was a very good captain , an excellent captain			2

@entity6 can not handle @entity4 , says @entity1
@entity4 unlikely to return to @entity3 after being effectively sacked
@entity83 born batsman has autobiography coming out in *october*
@entity61 would have dealt with @entity4 better , claims boycott
