former @entity1 spy @entity0 is launching her own fashion brand , it was revealed yesterday			1
the 31 year old redhead - once married to a @entity7 man - launched her line of ' casual clothes ' at a show in the @entity11 resort of @entity12			1
@entity14 's most glamorous secret agent hired talented young designers from @entity1 fashion colleges , said a spokesman for @entity18 , her main employer			1
fashionable : the range includes dresses and women 's handbags that are said to resemble books by famous radically - minded @entity1 writers launched at the @entity28 show 2014 , she wanted to produce clothes ' you could wear anywhere , from a big city to a backwater village ' , it was reported			1
' reporters and fashion magazines ' buyers from all over the world will have a chance to see the first women 's clothing collection by @entity0 , ' said the spokesman			0
her fashion range includes women 's handbags resembling books by famous radically - minded @entity1 writers , it is understood			1
one is a mock - up of the book ' who is to blame ? ' by @entity49 , a 19th century writer and thinker known as the father of @entity1 socialism			1
variety : @entity0 ( left ) said she designed the clothes so they could be worn in a city or village designs : the former secret agent 's interest in a clothes brand began three years ago another is modelled on @entity62 's ' who can be happy and @entity64 in @entity1 ? '			1
a third features revolutionary democrat @entity67 's ' what is to be done ? ' the brand will be called @entity0 - the surname she took when she wed @entity7 former public schoolboy @entity70 who she met on a trip to @entity72			2
the daughter of an alleged @entity76 officer , the flame haired agent was busted by @entity78 police in 2010 on accusations of being part of a network of sleeper agents			1
she was deported in a @entity84 - style spy swap along with nine others , and was then greeted by @entity87 leader @entity86 who took part in a patriotic sing - song with her			1
since her return to @entity1 , @entity0 has dabbled in politics , taken part in risque photoshoots for men 's magazines , and hosts a tv show about the mysteries of the world			1
inspiration : a spokesman for the company said she wanted a @entity1 dress that would ' please her soul ' her interest in a clothes brand ' all began three years and three months ago when @entity0 returned to motherland after jail in a prison shirt , ' said a statement			1
' she disliked these alien clothes and @entity0 went on to search for a @entity1 dress that would please her soul			1
she kept looking for it but did not find ' she was previously reported to be interested in designing new uniforms for @entity1 cosmonauts , though the project failed to materialise			2
in july she hit the headlines with a @entity117 proposal to wed @entity119 whistleblower @entity118 , who was at the time stranded in a @entity14 airport			0
the femme fatale walked out of an interview on @entity119 television when she was questioned about the proposal			0
' i 'm not going to discuss this , ' she told @entity128 's @entity127			0
' ok , the interview is finished			0
' she explained : ' i 'm a very private , discreet person and i still do n't do many interviews because i just do n't like to share			0
' i do n't believe that people would be interested in knowing about somebody 's life			0
' by @entity134 opinion : the designs are ' unimaginative and poorly constructed ' while the concept of a spy - created fashion label is intriguing , @entity0 ’s designs are unimaginative and poorly constructed			2
in the three photos provided to @entity143 , ms @entity0 ’s work displays serious execution issues including rippled hemlines and skewed seams			0
if ms @entity0 wanted to impress with a novelty clothing line worth looking at , she would have created the kinds of sharply tailored separates that viewers of shows like @entity151 and scandal have come to associate with fashionable spies			0
our fascination with fictitious , beautiful spies would have provided ms @entity0 with a vast demographic to sell her goods			0
but instead she has created conservative cotton - candy dresses that look like @entity163 princess @entity161 costumes – for the bible - toting set			2
a long , blue @entity166 dress – worn on a blonde model posing in an antiquated library – looks like a less magical version the dress @entity171 wears to prick her finger in @entity173			0
its improperly - fitted bodice and twisted hem highlight the design ’s likely cheap , synthetic fabric			2
adding to the fairytale attempt is a book clutch design that mimics the signature miniaudieres of @entity184 label @entity182			0
but ms @entity0 ’s book clutch does not boast the same handcrafted intelligence as the @entity182 originals she tries to emulate			0
it ’s brown velvet cover and machine - processed embroidery negates the concept ’s overall charm .			2

the 31 - year - old *introduced* her range of ' casual clothes ' at a show in @entity11
includes dresses and handbags made to look like books
former spy hired talented young designers from @entity1 colleges
