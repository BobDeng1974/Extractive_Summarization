by @entity1 reporter published : 13:47 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 04:58 est , 25 may 2013 a council has ordered its bin men not to go down uneven rural roads because they could suffer ' whole body vibrations '			1
residents in @entity7 , which recently introduced a new three bin system for rubbish , have been left to drag their own bins , sometimes for long distances , after the local authority instructed refuse workers not to go down roads with ' too many potholes '			1
nearly 500 people have complained about the extra loads they will need to pull so the council workers do n't have to experience the ' vibrations '			1
vibrating binmen : refuse workers in @entity7 , @entity22 , have been ordered to steer clear of country roads with too many potholes ( file picture for illustration only ) in one road in @entity30 - prior @entity29 road - residents will have to hike 39 bins half - a - mile , to the road - end			1
some have questioned the decision , saying postmen travel on the roads every day			1
the @entity37 describes ' whole body vibration ' as : ' transmitted through the seat or feet of employees who drive mobile machines , or other work vehicles , over rough and uneven surfaces as a main part of their job '			0
threat : @entity7 council is concerned their bin men could be vibrated by potholes @entity51 councillor @entity50 ( @entity52 & @entity53 ) said : ' residents in rural areas have been informed of a new three - bin refuse collection service , enabling the recycling of cans , plastics , paper and cardboard			1
' however , if the access road is considered unsuitable due to the quality of its surface , the number of potholes or its narrowness , then residents will have to take their bins to the end of the road for collection			1
' this is to avoid the staff being exposed to potentially damaging ' whole body vibration '			0
' @entity78 pointed out that whole body vibration was a @entity81 legislation concept not universally accepted			0
in response to @entity78 's questions at a recent @entity7 meeting , officials said that despite the number of appeals there was no need to review the arrangements as anyone dissatisfied with the result could use the corporate complaints procedure			2
access roads are assessed by a recycling advisor and a council lorry driver			1
@entity78 said that he would be happy to be present on - site during these inspections			2
he said : ' tractor drivers , post office workers and others drive up these roads and tracks without any evidence of whole body vibration damage			2
' the concept of whole body vibration is a product of @entity81 legislation which , as i understand it , has been ignored by , for example , the construction industry			0
@entity112 : many resident are being forced to drag their three required recycling bins up to half a mile away ' @entity117 residents pay the same taxes as their urban counterparts but receive a much reduced level of service			1
' their refuse bins should continue to be collected from the same locations as they are now			0
' @entity7 ’s waste collection service manager @entity124 said : ' @entity7 has a responsibility to protect its employees from injuries resulting from carrying out their jobs			2
' altering the way @entity7 collects waste from rural properties will not only reduce the risk of injury to staff but also provide an improved recycling service			1
' we carried out a very thorough assessment of the 5,400 rural properties we collect waste from and based our decision on the information gathered and advice from independent consultants			0
@entity51 councillor @entity50 said the decision had been made to avoid staff being exposed to potentially damaging ' whole body vibration ' ' we understand residents will have concerns about a change in service which is why we have written to every affected householder and explained to them the reason for moving them to a road - end collection			1
' if householders upgrade their access road they we can review our decision			0
we would be very happy to carry out a reassessment once any upgrading work has been completed			0
he added : ' @entity7 has information from independent consultants that shows that rural collection staff are exposed to unacceptably high levels of exposure to whole body vibration			2
as a result we must take action			0
' risk assessments were completed for each access track leading to rural properties			0
if the access road was deemed unsuitable then bins would be moved to road end in order to reduce the risks to our employees '			0
@entity7 says the following factors would make an access road unsuitable due to the risk of ' vibrations '			1
potholes greater than 40 cm ( about an inch and a half ) @entity185 ' unsuitably surfaced ' access road			0
@entity187 , 41 , who owns the @entity188 , in @entity189 , said the council had n’t seemed to be consistent in the houses they picked			0
she said : ' the council sent out about 4000 letters and about 500 people appealed the decision for end of road collection , of which we were one			1
' one of the issues was health and safety on rural roads and whole body vibration for the bin men			2
' my husband goes up on the farm equipment on the road , the previous bin men used it and other people seem to be fine on it			2
' we were very unhappy about it as we pay our council tax just like everyone else , but would n’t get the same service			0
our road is about three quarters of a mile long , it ’s a long way to drag a bin			1
in one road in @entity30 - prior @entity29 road - residents will have to hike 39 bins half - a - mile , to the road - end ' there does n’t seem to be any consistency either , other people who have bin collections on a different day to us , but on our road , were still getting the service			1
' we would see bin lorries going passed our house , and further up the road for collection , but they said they could n’t get ours			0
' a lot of people who live on these roads are also very elderly , and they ca n’t be trekking bins about			1
' we had a meeting with the council yesterday and reached some solution , but it is only as we were very vocal about it			0
' there will be many other people out of the 4000 who are stuck with this system as they do n’t know what to do ' .			2

*hundreds* of residents in @entity7 are being forced to drag bins up to half a mile
to make matters worse council now operates a three - bin recycling system
around 500 have already contacted the council to question the decision ,
they argue that many people , *including* postmen , use the roads every day
