we are not going to repeat the chaos and instability of the @entity13 years			0
' i have spoken to deputy leader @entity1 and we will stand together to urge the party room to defeat this particular motion			1
' but ms @entity1 , who did not appear with mr @entity2 , would only issue a short and very qualified statement of support			1

mr @entity2 said the mps who called for the spill - mr @entity38 and fellow backbencher @entity51 - were perfectly entitled to call for a challenge			1
however , he said : ' they are asking the @entity54 to vote out the people that the electorate voted in in september 2013			0
' mr @entity38 , a little - known @entity58 mp , announced he had moved a motion to topple the prime minister in an email to his @entity42 colleagues earlier this afternoon			1
he said that the knighthood of prince @entity64 , issued by mr @entity2 on @entity65 , was the final straw for him			2
in his email to his @entity42 colleagues he wrote : ' the knighthood issue was for many the final proof of a disconnection with the people , ' @entity38 wrote in the email			1
' i think that we must bring this to a head , and test the support of the leadership in the party room			1
' i have therefore submitted to the chief government whip a motion to spill the leadership positions of the @entity84			2
' chief government whip @entity85 said the matter had been listed for discussion for the @entity80 room meeting			0
trouble : prime minister @entity2 will reportedly face a leadership challenge on tuesday in @entity90 meanwhile , @entity92 mp @entity91 has branded the move to challenge mr @entity2 as disappointing and divisive			1

the email was copied to other coalition mps and senators			0
the note reportedly reads : ' @entity38 , your actions are disappointing and divisive			0
' in my view you are repeating the ill - disciplined and self - interested behaviours that the @entity58 people explicitly rejected in 2013			0
' you do not have my support for this			0
' i will be arguing strongly against your motion and in support of what i believe is a clear majority of colleagues and constituents who prefer stability and unity of purpose			0
' prime minister @entity2 was taking a selfie with worker @entity120 during his visit the @entity123 factory in the @entity125 suburb of @entity126 on friday while some @entity127 plotted a spill big lift : mr @entity2 will face a leadership challenge at the @entity42 room meeting on tuesday the leadership spill has been motioned ahead of the first major party room meeting of 2015 on tuesday it 's the first @entity42 leadership challenge since 2009			1

' at the first available opportunity i 've come straight to your studios from the airport , i am clearing up what i think is an unfortunate misinterpretation of remarks that i made this morning , ' he said			0
' perhaps because i 'm usually so ebullient , because it was six o'clock in the morning and i was tired rather than effusive and ebullient maybe people have misinterpreted my position , ' he said			0
senior labor figure @entity211 , who was also on the show , retorted : ‘ when you start having senior people who ca n’t say that the prime minister has the numbers then it ’s over			2
