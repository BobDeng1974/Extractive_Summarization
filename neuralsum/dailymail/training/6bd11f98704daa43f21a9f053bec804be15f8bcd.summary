’ the volatile race has elevated and discarded a wide assortment of front - runners , with some falling out of the race or not even deciding to run - such as businessmen @entity41 and @entity43			2
the two who seem most likely to challenge mr @entity8 for victory in @entity5 were former @entity46 senator mr @entity9 and libertarian @entity47 representative @entity7			1
@entity47 governor @entity48 and mr @entity49 seem likelier to give mr @entity8 a long - haul challenge , but mr @entity9 insisted his rise is because @entity54 are ‘ looking for the candidate they can trust ’			1
republicans will gather in living rooms , high school gymnasiums and local libraries for caucuses that start the process of picking the @entity26 nominee on tuesday night			0
struggling : former house speaker @entity49 , @entity63 representative @entity62 and @entity47 governor @entity48 , all pictured today left to right , are all trailing and not expected to do well in @entity5 voters will urge friends and neighbours to support a preferred candidate			1
but for all of the attention paid to the caucuses , they are essentially a nonbinding straw poll that awards no delegates			0

i will go to work to get @entity35 back to work ' @entity8 @entity26 do that at county and district conventions later in the year			2
president @entity31 is n't ceding the stage to the @entity26 while they kick off sorting out the 1,144 delegates			2
the president , fresh off a 10 - day @entity84 vacation with his family rumoured to have cost $ 4million , made plans to host an evening web chat with supporters in @entity5 as the caucuses were under way			0
most polls in recent days have put mr @entity8 and mr @entity7 atop the @entity26 field in @entity5 , with mr @entity9 in third and gaining ground			1
more than a third of voters could yet change their minds			0
but mr @entity48 , mr @entity49 and @entity63 representative @entity62 are trailing and not looking likely to do well in @entity5			1

we can not have another four years of @entity31 ' @entity120 four years ago socially conservative voters united behind former @entity123 governor @entity122 , denying mr @entity8 a first - place finish and contributing to his eventual defeat			1
mr @entity48 told @entity126 that mr @entity8 is simply a ‘ conservative of convenience			1
’ mrs @entity62 , another of the onetime front - runners who has fallen , said she is the ‘ one true conservative ’			1
mr @entity49 , who still insists anyone could win , said mr @entity8 should ‘ level with the @entity35 people ’ about his moderate political views and admitted on @entity133 that he is calling his rival a ‘ liar ’			1
early on , mr @entity49 had insisted he would run a positive campaign , but that strategy disappeared after he sank in the polls under the weight of negative ads paid for by his opponents			2

‘ my shoulders are wide , ’ he told @entity126			0
