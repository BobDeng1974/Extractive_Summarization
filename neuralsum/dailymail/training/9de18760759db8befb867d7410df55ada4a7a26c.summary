a disgruntled resident has posted a hilarious rant on their neighbour 's door , berating them for their angry lovemaking , ' primeval grunting ' and ' @entity9 ' accent			1
in the passive aggressive missive , which is titled , ' to @entity12 ' , the writer even asks their amorous neighbour to bolt the bed to the floor in a bid to keep the noise down			1
the anonymous author lives in the @entity9 suburb of @entity21 which is saturated with hedonistic teenagers and backpackers , and the note was picked up by @entity25 on friday morning			1
and in a clear dig as the mystery lover 's prowess , who they claim is called @entity44 , the fellow resident swipes , ' luckily for me @entity44 does n't appear to last long , and for that i am thankful			0
' i do not wish to pry in on your sex life , apartment 12 , ' they continue , ' however i do ask that before you mount @entity44 ( or the rhino ) i suggest you bolt the bed to the floor as so the rest of the beautiful residents here do not have to listen to your very loud , very short yet very annoying lovemaking sessions			2
the @entity9 suburb @entity21 is a mecca for students , backpackers and fun - seekers searching for sun , sand , sea ... and booze ' let me give you a play by play , ' they continue			2
' as i am asleep , dreaming of playing the perfect game of golf , i near the 13th hole , when suddenly i am awoken by what i can only describe as sounding like a @entity79 attempting to demolish a wall , with a jackhammer , whilst high on meth ... and cocaine			0
' the wordsmith continues , ' i do not know who @entity44 is or how much he weighs , i can only assume it is a lot due to the fact that on several occasions my bedroom slight begins to shake			0
' party - central : @entity21 beach is a haven for hedonistic international back - packers on the hunt for a good time the cranky writer also comes across as a bit snobby as they confess they can handle the ' hordes of alcohol - fuelled guests , coming and going at all hours of the morning			1
' and they admit , ' i can handle your annoying and slightly western suburbs sounding voice as you seem to proclaim your love for your hordes of booze filled guests , ' and ' i can deal with the hordes of intoxicated foreigners screaming ' i love @entity21 ' in broken @entity111 as i eat dinner with my family '			2
berating them for their stray cigarettes that land on the balcony , the troubled typist helpfully reminds the recipient , ' that ashtrays have been around since 1825 and are available from most good retail outlets , ' and points them in the direction of the @entity21 convenience store			0
party time : a scene typical of a friday and saturday night on @entity21 's main streets during the summer over to you @entity128 ...			0
