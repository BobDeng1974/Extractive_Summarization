with her bulging forehead , double chin and thin pursed lips , @entity0 was no oil painting … if @entity6 oil paintings are to be believed			1
twenty - first century actresses , meanwhile , tend to have a natural beauty			0
which has left the makers of the @entity12 's big budget adaptation of @entity14 's @entity13 with something of a dilemma			1
the public largely gets its image of @entity0 from the portrait of her by @entity37 artist @entity36 , depicting her with a noticeably large forehead			2
however , she is played in the series by @entity19 , 25 , who can not be faulted when it comes to her looks			1
according to @entity18 , 41 , chief curator at @entity42 , miss @entity19 – in her first professional role – has features which are too dainty			2
miss @entity18 said : ' she 's too pretty			2
i did challenge @entity46 [ the director ] about that			0
he laughed and said , ' i picked her because of her acting , not because of her forehead '			0
' homeland star @entity51 plays @entity21 in the six - part series on the rapid rise to power of sir @entity55 in @entity57 's court			1
but , speaking yesterday , the historian said it was not a remark she would extend to the whole cast , which includes homeland star @entity51 , 43 , and @entity62 , 30			0
she said : ' they are not all fantastically good looking , are they ? ' @entity65 [ who plays @entity55 ] has a wonderful craggy , creased face and , on the whole , as a cast i would say they are human rather than beautiful			0
it 's not like it 's been turned into a pageant show			0
' reverend @entity74 , professor of the history of the church at the @entity77 , said he did n't see miss @entity19 ' beauty as a problem : ' ideas of beauty change from century to century and you might as well make them beautiful on our terms , because it 's quite possible that the portraits of @entity0 that we 've got were meant to flatter and give the impression that she was a beautiful woman			1
' historians also pointed out that @entity89 in @entity90 , which was used to portray @entity91 , is @entity92 author @entity93 has said courtiers would have had white teeth , as sugar was not yet widely available			1
she also said members of the court would not have been covered in filth he continued that while the show is not an ' exact fit on the history ' , it is an impressive ' evocation of the period '			0
@entity13 , which starts tomorrow night on @entity106 , is a six - part adaptation of @entity108 's @entity13 and @entity110 novels			1
miss @entity18 questioned the authenticity of some aspects of the programme , claiming both the original books and now this adaptation have brought the characters firmly into the modern day			2
she said : ' what @entity14 has done is made these characters people for our times , which is interesting for a historian to watch			2
they are immensely modern , they wo n't be saying thee and thou and being all dramatic and over the top			0
' i think it will make people think the @entity130 were just like us in many ways			0
that 's a massive historical question , in some ways they were and in some ways they were n't			0
' the programme - makers have revealed the lengths they have gone to to ensure historical accuracy – including an unexpected insistence on straight , white teeth and pristine linen			1
@entity14 said a @entity6 drama would be less accurate had it insisted on blackened teeth and filthy courtiers – as it was a time when sugar was yet to become widely available .			1

historians have *spotted* a series of faux pas in @entity12 drama @entity13
actress @entity19 is reportedly too pretty to play @entity0
*location* @entity89 is said to be @entity92
makers *previously* said historians had been brought in to *advise*
@entity14 had insisted characters in show have straight white teeth
said it would be historically *inaccurate* for them to have blackened teeth
adaptation tells the story sir @entity55 's rise in @entity21 's court
