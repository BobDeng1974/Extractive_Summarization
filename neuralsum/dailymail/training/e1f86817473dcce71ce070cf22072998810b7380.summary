by @entity0 published : 02:45 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 02:45 est , 26 july 2013 from full size inflatable dolls to the @entity4 doll created by @entity6 artist @entity5 , there 's no shortage of bedtime companions for lonely singletons			0
but one @entity12 company has taken matters one step further with the launch of a body pillow that comes complete with gel inserts in the buttocks and breasts			1
just in case ( presumably ) male shoppers are n't clear how it works , the makers @entity24 have produced a video showing the pillow 's assets being poked and squeezed as well as a sequence featuring the gels themselves			2
the pink - haired @entity35 made her debut in 2007 and proved an instant hit with @entity12 men , who found other characters such as the demure @entity53 a little too demure			1
last summer , the company launched a version of the pillow with squeezable breast inserts but decided to up the ante with this summer 's launch			1
@entity63 though the @entity62 pillow seems , it is far from the being the first unusual companion for lonely males dreamed up by a @entity12 company			2
@entity67 : the breast implants can be poked as much as the owner likes - as the demo video reveals plastic : the pillows contain silicone implants similar to those used by breast enlargement surgeons along with vending machines that sell used knickers , last september saw the launch of @entity79 , a cafe that lets men cuddle up to pretty women for a small fee			0
recently , the hugely popular venture launched a ' oshiri makura ' service which lets visitors rest their heads on the women 's bottoms in the privacy of a private booth			0
sadly for those men looking for a comfortable derriere on which to rest their head , a minute of oshiri makura time costs 1,000 yen ( £ 6.50 ) - £ 390 an hour .			0

the body pillow is based on erotic computer game character @entity35
the computer *generated* *bombshell* is popular among @entity12 men
the makers did a boob - only version in 2012 but upped the ante this year
