and now - 150 years after the sacred , mountainous land in @entity9 's @entity8 was taken from them by the @entity12 government - the @entity13 are desperately trying to raise $ 9million to get it returned			1
however , the bid has sparked controversy among the native @entity12 tribesman , many of whom are angry that they are being forced to buy back land that once belonged to them			1
the ranch - nearly 2,000 acres - encompasses the sacred site of @entity30 ' @entity29 @entity31 , the vice president of the @entity32 in @entity9 , told the @entity33 : ' it ’s like someone stealing my car and i have to pay to get it back			1
' a portion of the rolling range of mountains , given the name of called @entity29 by the @entity13 tribes , was offered for sale earlier this year			1
the family that have controlled the land since 1876 - the year that general @entity48 died - have accepted a bid for the land made by more than half a dozen @entity52 tribes			1
the group , which includes some of the country 's poorest people , is now scrambling to raise the $ 9million needed to buy back the land before next month 's deadline , the @entity33 reported			1
not for sale : @entity13 at @entity59 , @entity9 , protesting in 2004 against the government taking away treatied land sacred land : the @entity8 was given to the @entity13 in 1868 but mountains ( pictured ) were snatched back by the government after the discovery of gold the move is the latest in a long and controversial battle over ownership of the land after the @entity12 broke several treaties when it took it from the natives			1
the government 's seizure of the @entity8 was described as one of the most dishonourable acts in @entity12 history in a landmark federal court decision in 1979			1
the @entity52 tribes have been blighted by poverty and unemployment for generations			0
if they can not raise the money they stand to lose their sacred land as well as a $ 900,000 initial payment they put down			1
sioux tribal leaders from all over the @entity91 will meet this week to devise a strategy to come up with the remaining $ 8.1million by november 30			1
' our ceremonial patterns would collapse ' : the current owners have always allowed the @entity13 to access the land for prayer rituals way of life : if the @entity13 fail in their bid to buy @entity29 they say their culture could ' come to an end ' the current owners - the @entity107 family - have always allowed the @entity13 to access the land for prayer ceremonies			2
however , if the @entity13 fail in their bid to buy @entity29 they say their culture could ' come to an end ' if the land was bought by an owner who prevented them from visiting , effectively finishing 3,000 years of annual pilgrimages			2
@entity115 , who teaches @entity13 history and culture at @entity118 in @entity119 , told the @entity33 : ' our ceremonial patterns would collapse			0
' heading the purchase bid is the @entity122 in @entity9			0
it 's treasurer @entity124 said : ' this is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for us to get some land back that is very , very dear to us			2
' most of the tribes want to do something , but it ’s very difficult for them to raise any money , especially of this magnitude			0
' gold rush : a prospector in the @entity8			2
the site was snatched back from the @entity13 when gold was discovered the @entity13 have an ancient association with @entity29 , 1,942 acres of prairie in the heart of the @entity8 mountain range			1
they consider @entity143 to be sacred and believe the site was once the setting of an epic battle between good and evil			0
the @entity13 honour this with an annual religious ceremony which welcomes the spring after a long winter			0
in 1868 , the @entity149 granted them ownership but the mountains were taken back by the federal government when gold was discovered			0
the area then became a hot spot for prospectors hoping to cash in on the gold rush			0
the land was homesteaded by the @entity107 , a ranching family , since the @entity160 in 1876			0
despite owning the land where the @entity13 perform healing ceremonies , the @entity107 have allowed the @entity13 to access the site			0
however , they divided their 1,940 acres into five tracts which were sold at auction last month			0
pictures of the lot show the land to be a remote prairie where wild deer roam			0
the @entity172 was accused of using deplorable tactics from drive the @entity13 from @entity29 before it appropriated the land , including starving them			1
in 1979 , more than 100 years later , the @entity12 @entity176 said of the federal government 's actions : ' a more ripe and rank case of dishonourable dealing will never , in all probability , be found in our history			0
' a year later , the @entity184 ordered the government to compensate the @entity13 for seizing the @entity8 site , but the tribes refused to accept the money			1
they believe accepting compensation effectively condones the sale of the mountain and they instead have insisted @entity8 is returned to tribal authority			2
despite the fact the government compensation fund has grown to more than $ 800million as it sits in a bank account accumulating interest , the @entity13 have refused to use the money to buy @entity29 .			2

time is running out for tribes to buy back sacred land taken from them by the @entity172
they have just weeks to come up with remaining $ 8.1million needed to purchase portion of the @entity8
