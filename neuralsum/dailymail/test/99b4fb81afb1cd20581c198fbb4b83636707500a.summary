the police van in which @entity2 supposedly sustained his fatal injuries does not come with a bolt sticking out from the back door , @entity0 has confirmed			1
designs from the car maker show that the @entity8 - the vehicle used by the @entity10 - is smooth on the inside of both cage doors			1
@entity0 spokesman @entity13 confirmed to @entity14 that the standard issue @entity16 has bolts that are built into the door and do n't stick out			0
mr @entity13 said that law enforcement agencies are known to customise their own vehicles and that the @entity10 may have done so to their fleet			2
the development raises a number of questions about the official account put out by the force which emerged today in a report of its internal investigation into @entity2 's death			1
in their report @entity64 said that there was ' no evidence ' @entity2 sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest , which was caught on camera on a street side on april 12			1
instead he supposedly broke his neck after falling head - first whilst being transported in one of the @entity10 vans , a @entity8			1
@entity2 's ' catastrophic ' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt ' in the back door of the van ' , the report said			1
fatal fall ? the van is pictured above during a previously - undisclosed stop dead : @entity2 is pictured above being arrested by @entity44 officers on the day he severed his spine in custody according to @entity64 's sources @entity2 was standing in the van and was bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door			1
but a review of official diagrams of the @entity16 by @entity14 raises a number of issues with this			0
the picture of the vehicle on the cargo specifications shows the two sets of bolts at the very top and very bottom of the door			0
this means that even if they had stuck out , @entity2 would have had to have either been thrown 5ft into the air or have his head right on the floor in order for him to have been hurt			2
the catalog for the van shows a picture from another angle and makes clear that the only things on the back door are a grille to let air in and the door itself - with no bolt sticking out			2
a picture taken by the @entity124 of the van in which @entity2 was carried shows that the right hand side door is smooth and does not have a bolt sticking out of it			1
the left side is not visible			0
not on us : a @entity0 spokesman told @entity14 that their vans do n't include protruding bolts - but left open the possibility that @entity10 modified their vehicle @entity0 routinely modifies a number of its vehicles for law enforcement use , a lucrative market for the company			2
they have proved popular with the public too and the @entity8 is the same vehicle used by @entity144 as her ‘ @entity145 ’ on the presidential campaign trail			0
the brochure for the @entity16 states that it ‘ delivers on a grand scale ’ and that it seats up to 15 people , including prisoners			0
there are frontal airbags and head curtain side - impact air bags but only for the front three rows which would be occupied by police			0
according to @entity0 , which is owned by @entity157 , the vehicle is the ‘ unmatched capability you need on the job ’			0
@entity14 has approached the @entity10 for comment .			0

medical *examiner* 's report described how @entity2 may have injured neck
theory claimed he fell *forward* while cuffed and hit his head on a bolt
but specifications for the @entity8 van show no such bolt
photographs of other @entity10 also *contradict* theory
@entity2 's spine was somehow severed while in police custody on april 12
