@entity1 manager @entity0 insists he is ' relaxed ' about @entity3 's contract situation despite claims that the latest discussions have failed to find a solution to a long - running impasse			1
the club have tabled what a couple of weeks ago @entity0 described as an ' incredible ' offer - reported to be in the region of £ 100,000 a week			1
a few weeks before that the @entity13 boss had suggested an agreement was imminent but latest reports suggest there has been no movement in negotiations			0
@entity3 has still not penned a new deal despite being reportedly offered £ 100,000 - a - week @entity13 manager @entity0 ( left ) insists he is ' relaxed ' about the situation @entity21 2014 - 15 appearances 25 goals 6 assists 8 @entity3 has been locked in talks over a contract extension for several months but the 20 - year - old has told club officials he wants to focus on the remainder of @entity1 ’s @entity21 season and on winning the @entity29			1
given @entity3 ’s status as one of @entity35 ’s top emerging talents , @entity30 and @entity31 are watching on closely			1
likewise , @entity21 clubs will also enter the race if it becomes clear @entity3 is available			1
nonetheless , @entity0 claims he is not overly concerned by the current situation			2
' there is nothing new to report on it			0
i am quite relaxed about @entity3 's situation , ' he said			1
' he is not going anywhere in a hurry - he has still got this season and another couple of years to go on his contract			2
' i think it is quite obvious when you look at @entity3 's situation anyone with @entity3 's best interests would see @entity1 as the best option for his career			1
the @entity55 - born winger has scored 10 goals in all competitions this season @entity0 had previously claimed that the club would not be held to ransom by the player 's agent ' he turned 20 in december and he has made 114 appearances , which is a remarkable amount at a club of this size to be given that opportunity			1
' he has made it clear himself that he loves being here and i think he was quoted as saying this is the best place for any young player to develop , so that makes me quite relaxed			0
' i am sure the club and his representatives will find the solution for that			0
' @entity0 has previously suggested the club would not be held to ransom by @entity3 's agent and said the contract offer they had made was more than fair for a player of the @entity84 international 's age and potential			1
asked why he thought a deal had not been agreed yet , the manager said : ' i 'm not sure			0
it is not in my area really			0
' i speak to @entity3 about his football and concentrate on his football and see what goes from there			2
' @entity3 and @entity94 , who has been captaining the side in the absence of the injured @entity97 , are the two players whose contracts appear to be taking most of the headlines			2
sterling trains with captain @entity97 ( right ) who has recovered from a spell out with a hamstring injury however , with @entity1 closing in on a top - four place and having one eye on a possible @entity29 final , it is imperative they do not allow off - field issues to distract them			2
@entity0 is confident neither player will drop their standards as he believes they are both focused on the job in hand			2
' these are two players who want to ensure they are here for the future , ' he added			0
' the model of this club is to develop the talent and create world - class players and then , of course , it is important we keep those - especially when they are here already - and that is something we are working hard to do			0
' the players are working well , they are concentrated , and that side of it they have to leave to their representatives and the club so we 'll just focus on the football			0
' it is never easy but there are players , with all due respect , in @entity140 and @entity141 who are working on six - month or one - year contracts			0
@entity144 captain - in - waiting @entity94 ( 3rd left ) is also yet to sign a contract extension ' it is a lot more insecure at that level than it is at this level so i am sure they will cope fine knowing they have two or two - and - a - half years left on their deals			1
' @entity1 will have to watch the race for the top four develop without them this weekend as they do not play until monday when they travel to @entity161			1
the squad has been boosted by the return of @entity97 from a hamstring problem which has sidelined him for seven matches while @entity169 , after his head injury last weekend against @entity167 in the @entity29 , and midfielder @entity168 are both fit			0
defender @entity171 has also returned to training after a long - term knee problem .			0
