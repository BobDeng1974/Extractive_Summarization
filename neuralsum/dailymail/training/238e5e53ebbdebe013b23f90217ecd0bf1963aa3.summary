by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 02:03 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 04:22 est , 3 january 2014 the story of the @entity3 has been the same for @entity4 from first to last and it followed a dismally familiar pattern for them on the first day of the last test when they wasted a clear opportunity to bowl @entity10 out cheaply			1
@entity4 backed up their promise to usher in a new era , with the @entity3 long gone , by picking three debutants in the same match for the first time in seven years but they could not avert the same old script unfolding at the @entity1			0
when @entity10 had crashed to 97 for five after @entity18 had finally won a toss the door was open for @entity4 to force a consolation win and avoid the horrible spectre of a 5 - 0 @entity3 humiliation against a less than great side			2
but there was a horrible start to their innings when @entity30 was out for a duck , caught at leg - slip by @entity50 off @entity39 , and @entity4 went in eight for one			1
not since @entity18 , @entity53 and , lest we forget , @entity51 made their debuts in @entity56 in 2006 have @entity4 fielded three debutants in the same match and the results of two the trio were mixed to say the least			2
nice work : @entity34 watches a beauty of a pull shot in his imperious spell at the crease gotcha : @entity67 's massive appeal pays off as @entity68 is dismissed early on finally : @entity37 and @entity34 stopped the @entity43 rot with a robust partnership for @entity10 @entity4 left out @entity53 and @entity71 , both of whose test days may now be numbered , and more surprisingly @entity73 with , as expected , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 coming in and taking @entity4 ’s tally of players used here to a record 18 for an overseas series			1
it would be wrong to expect instant results from such inexperienced players but @entity76 in particular had the debut of his worst nightmares while @entity75 , who turned into more of a batsman than leg - spinner for @entity89 last season , showed that he is far from the finished article as a bowler			1
no @entity4 player can match @entity95 ’s introduction at @entity96 last summer for pure misery but @entity76 , making his bow at the highest level at 29 , came close by having to twice leave the field mid-over with hamstring trouble			0
@entity4 had not trusted any of their three giant fast bowlers to play since @entity110 ’s less than auspicious performance in @entity104 but they gave the @entity105 his chance despite concerns about his fragility in a five - day contest			0
it was an understandable selection but what was a concern was the sight of @entity76 in conversation with the @entity4 physio , doctor and team director @entity118 in the nets ahead of the day ’s play			2
if there were genuine worries about his fitness before the game then @entity76 should not have played here			0
it emerged afterwards that he had cramp and had not torn his hamstring as first feared it did not seem to matter when @entity4 had an excellent first session , taking four wickets , and when they added a fifth almost straight after lunch , but the emergence of @entity37 seemed to scramble the brains of the bowlers and rob them of all their discipline and control			2
first they started to bowl too short at the fiery wicketkeeper and then engaged him in yet another verbal battle on which he has thrived throughout a series in which he has scored at least one half century in every @entity41			0
it was terrible cricket from @entity4 as they allowed @entity37 and @entity34 , who has answered all doubts about his ability as a @entity146 5 , to add 128 for the sixth wicket at four an over and probably change the course of this @entity41			1
the long walk : @entity26 pumps his fist as @entity151 makes his way back to the pavilion early on : @entity18 and @entity151 read through their teams before the first ball is bowled not too shabby : here 's how @entity34 reached 115 in the @entity158 wagon wheel calamity : @entity76 's test debut was cut short after the bowler picked up an injury heartbreak : @entity76 cuts a dejected figure as the @entity4 medical staff give him a once over a side can rarely have dominated a five - @entity168 series to such an extent with such an average top six as @entity10 and their limitations were in evidence again as @entity174 ’s footwork was horribly exposed , @entity165 was a bit unlucky to play on , @entity151 looked uncomfortable against pace and @entity68 became @entity4 ’s first lbw victim of the series			1
when @entity179 , who has struggled in his first @entity168 series , became @entity182 ’s second wicket @entity4 were on top , as they have been so often on this tour with the ball in their hand			0
but @entity37 , and then @entity34 , changed all that			1
@entity26 has been a ray of light amid the gloom of this series and he too showed that he has much to learn with the ball when he bowled inconsistently at times and gave away four no balls with his habit of knocking the bails with his hand in his delivery stride			0
another dubutant : @entity75 watches after bowling in his first ever @entity168 popular figure : @entity200 gets ready for a picture with some @entity203 girls say cheese : during a break in the play , @entity200 poses with some fans at the @entity1 but , with @entity76 indisposed and @entity67 being sucked into bowling too short at @entity37 , @entity4 needed their rookie all - rounder to stand up and be counted			1
@entity26 , scorer of a mature century in @entity210 , did not disappoint			0
@entity26 , who had induced that fatal pull from @entity165 and had taken the key wicket of @entity151 , added @entity37 after he had made his sixth half - century in seven innings in this series before finishing the @entity43 innings with three wickets in an over			1
the @entity89 man was even on a hat - trick when he dismissed @entity221 first ball but quickly added @entity34 after @entity222 had kept him out			2
his team - mate at @entity89 , @entity75 , had claimed his first @entity168 wicket in his fifth over , recovering from an opening spell in which he conceded 21 runs in three overs , when @entity39 hit him straight up in the air			1
near miss : @entity34 evades a bouncing ball from @entity182 top team : @entity34 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) elevated the @entity43 ' total after an early struggle it had been a shock when @entity4 dropped @entity73 but the fact is he had become as shot as the bulk of the other @entity4 players in this series while they clearly wanted to have one last look at @entity30 before consigning him to the list of players they will draw a line under following this series			1
that look did not last long as @entity39 , his rise from joke figure the last time @entity4 were here to formidable performer now complete , toyed with the opener before having him caught by @entity222 before the close			0
only a second innings century is likely to save the 33 - year - old from the test axe now			0
@entity257 had been promoted to @entity258 for this match but the demise of @entity30 led to the emergence of @entity67 in a continuation of @entity4 ’s questionable policy of using nightwatchmen in such circumstances			0
at least @entity67 and @entity18 survived to the close but with @entity39 ’s tail up and this @entity1 pitch still green @entity4 face yet another tough battle if they are going to get towards parity here			2
the prospect of 5 - 0 remains all too real			0
not again : @entity39 snared @entity30 ( left ) for a duck lightning : the speed merchant lured the @entity4 batsman into being caught at slip lining up : @entity4 fielders watch intently during @entity10 's innings			1

@entity26 takes six wickets on first day of fifth test in @entity1
@entity34 prevents @entity43 collapse with sublime 115
@entity37 chips in with 75 after @entity10 reduced to 97 for five
@entity30 dismissed for a duck by @entity39
@entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 make @entity41 debuts
@entity73 , @entity71 and @entity53 drop out
