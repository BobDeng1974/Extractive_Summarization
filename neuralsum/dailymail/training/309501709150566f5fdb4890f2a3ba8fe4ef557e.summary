one of the biggest concerns about smart household gadgets is how much data they collect and share about you and your home			1
and , with this in mind , a @entity10 government consumer watchdog has laid out guidelines that call for increased privacy and security across connected devices , for fitness , smart homes and other uses			1
at the moment , the guidelines are only suggestions and ' best practices ' that companies are encouraged to follow , but the agency did call on @entity24 to consider legislation to cover such data security			1
the guidelines were announced by @entity29 chairwoman @entity28 at the @entity31 conference in @entity32 ( pictured )			1
these guidelines call for increased privacy and security across connected devices , but are currently only suggestions and ' best practices ' firms are encouraged to follow the guidelines were announced by @entity29 chairwoman @entity28 at the @entity31 conference in @entity32			1
' not only is deeply personal information at stake but as you have more and more devices it means there is more potential for exposure , ' she told attendees			0
' if you want these new technologies to flourish , you want to make sure consumers understand what is happening , understand what is being collected , with whom that information is being shared , how this information is being used			0
' although the term ‘ @entity57 ’ ( @entity57 ) first appeared in 2005 , there is still no widely accepted definition			2
@entity57 includes gadgets bought by consumers , as well as products and services designed for businesses to help machines ‘ communicate ’ with each other			1
for example , the term @entity57 can include the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) tags businesses place on products in stores to track their inventory , or sensors that monitor electricity use in hotels			1
for the purposes of the report , the @entity29 uses the term @entity57 to refer to devices or sensors - other than computers , smartphones , or tablets - that connect , communicate or transmit information over the web			1
it is limited to the gadgets sold to , or used by , consumers			2
as part of the report , the @entity29 recommends a number of actions			1
these include building security into devices at the outset , training employees about the importance of security , adding measures to stop unauthorised people accessing the device or network , and monitoring connected devices and providing security updates as soon as risks are identified			1
last year , the @entity29 studied 12 mobile fitness apps and found they shared data with 76 separate entities			1
ms @entity28 continued : ' if i 'm wearing a fitness band that tracks how many calories i consume i would n't want to share that data with an insurance company			1
' the @entity29 report made no specific legislative recommendation for @entity57 but said ' there appeared to be widespread agreement that companies developing @entity57 products should implement reasonable security			1
' the report added : ‘ the @entity29 recognises this industry is in its relatively early stages [ and ] does not believe that the privacy and security risks , though real , need to be addressed through @entity57 - specific legislation at this time			1
‘ however , while @entity57 specific - legislation is not needed , @entity24 should enact general data security legislation			1
’ this interactive image shows how internet of things devices can be used in a ' connected ' living room - and other rooms in a smart house			2
these gadgets are connected using @entity131 , set up by chipmaker @entity132 in 2011			2
the software can be added to smart devices to make them ‘ talk ’ to other devices running @entity131 the guidelines would apply to the billions of devices that connect to the internet including cars , fridges , toothbrushes , fitness trackers , locks , security systems , and more			1
but @entity147 president @entity146 said : ' at best , this is just another exercise in workshop theatre ; at worst , the @entity29 is trying to regulate the @entity57 by stealth			1
' the report concluded : ' the @entity57 presents numerous benefits to consumers , and has the potential to change the ways that consumers interact with technology in fundamental ways			1
' in the future , the @entity57 is likely to meld the virtual and physical worlds together in ways that are currently difficult to comprehend			2
to mark @entity162 , a study from internet and mobile security company @entity164 found that 41 % of people post content about others online today is @entity162 - an international effort focusing on : ' respecting privacy , @entity170 and @entity171			1
' it is dedicated to helping people better understand how to protect personal information online			0
commenting on the campaign , @entity175 , chief technical officer for @entity176 at @entity177 told @entity179 : ' when dealing with very sensitive information , people need to know about very secure measures , such as information rights management			0
' security is about knowing what the danger is and how to deploy the appropriate level of protection			0
' if we want a truly data - secure society we need to start by ensuring people know what value their data has , then they can make informed decision about how to secure it			0
' @entity196 , vice president of cloud services , identity and data protection at data security firm @entity200 added : ' mobile devices are becoming a popular target for hackers			1
' this is hardly a surprise given so many of us have between one and three of them , and they are increasingly used to store sensitive work files and personal information			0
' the challenge with these devices is that because they connect to the cloud , data ends up being stored in multiple places and this gives the hackers multiple attack points to use			2
' therefore , unless security controls are in place and companies understand the location of where the data is being stored , there is a greater risk that these devices or their data could be breached			1
' a @entity164 survey has revealed that ' an alarmingly high number ' of people do n't give much consideration to what they post online			0
for example , while 64 per cent of respondents said they give thought to their online reputation 36 per cent said they did n’t			0
a further 77 per cent said they also consider what they post might affect other people , but 23 per cent said it ' barely entered their minds '			0
more than 40 per cent said they post content about other people , while 59 per cent said they never do			0
' from a security and privacy perspective , the predicted pervasive introduction of sensors and devices into currently intimate spaces - such as the home , the car , and with wearables and ingestibles , even the body - poses particular challenges			1
' it added the @entity29 will continue to ' enforce laws , educate consumers and businesses , and engage with consumer advocates , industry , academics , and other stakeholders ' to promote appropriate security and privacy protections			1
there are also industry - led bodies that are already working on securing and standardising the @entity57 protocols			2
there are also industry - led bodies that are already working on securing and standardising the @entity57 protocols for smart gadgets ( illustrated in this graphic )			2
for example , the @entity131 has developed ' a secure , persistent connectivity protocol ' between @entity278 routers and cloud providers @entity57 gadgets include the the august smart lock ( pictured left )			2
fitted to the existing door lock , the battery - powered device is controlled by the august app. to open the lock , anyone with a code can approach the door , enable their phone 's @entity288 and press the relevant address from the app ( pictured right ) for example , at this year 's @entity292 , the @entity131 announced it had developed ' a secure , persistent connectivity protocol ' between @entity278 routers and cloud providers			0
@entity131 members include @entity132 , @entity297 , and @entity298 , among others			0
this protocol is a step towards managing the security and privacy of all smart gadgets that are used in the car and home , and the work is based on an existing open source protocol called @entity131			1
@entity131 was set up by @entity132 in 2011			0
it is software that can be added to smart devices to make them ‘ talk ’ to other devices running @entity131			0
the company has since partnered with a number of companies that have developed smart household devices to help develop the software further			0
another device is a smart security alarm called @entity321 ( pictured )			2
it can be connected to smart lights from @entity324			0
the lights could then flash in the bedroom , to silently alert homeowners to an intruder downstairs such @entity57 gadgets include the the august smart lock			2
fitted to an existing door lock , the battery - powered device is controlled by registered phones or tablets using the august app. to open the lock , anyone with a code can approach the door , enable their phone 's @entity288 and press the relevant address from the app. the lock takes a few seconds to scan for a paired @entity288 device			0
it then confirms the visitor 's identity			0
using @entity131 , this lock can also be connected to a smart smoke or security alarm , such as @entity348			2
when the alarm detects smoke , it triggers an event that is picked up by the lock			0
the lock then automatically opens to let people leave the house in a fire quickly			0
another device is a smart security alarm called @entity358			0
it can be connected to smart lights from @entity324			0
the lights could then flash in the bedroom , for example , to silently alert homeowners to the fact there is an intruder downstairs .			0

guidelines were announced by the @entity29 ( @entity29 )
they call for for increased privacy and security across connected devices
report expressed concern how much data gadgets collect and share
@entity29 found fitness apps , for example , can share data with 76 other firms
the ' @entity57 ' includes gadgets bought by consumers , as well as business products and services that ' communicate ' with each other
guidelines are currently only suggestions firms are encouraged to follow
but , @entity29 called on @entity24 to consider legislation to cover data security
