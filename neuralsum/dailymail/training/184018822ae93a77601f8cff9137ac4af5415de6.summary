by @entity0 @entity1 inflicted the fatal knife wound that killed @entity3 , a court has ruled			0
high on drugs , she cut the @entity10 exchange student ’s neck with a kitchen knife during a row over money , the court in @entity6 has said			0
miss @entity14 , 21 , a @entity15 student , was found half - naked , her throat slit , in the cottage she shared with @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity6 , in november 2007			1
then , in a retrial earlier this year , the pair ’s acquittal was overturned and they were sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively			0
a third man , @entity40 national @entity3 is serving a 16 - year sentence for the killing			0
the court in @entity22 has now published the reasons behind @entity18 and @entity32 ’s reconviction			1
prosecutors had originally maintained the murder was the result of a sex game gone wrong , but the judges dismissed this theory , saying an agreement to have group sex ‘ was not compatible with @entity3 ’s character ’			1
found guilty : @entity18 and @entity56 served four years in prison before being acquitted and released			2
however , they were reconvicted by the @entity22 appeals court on january 30 , and sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively the killing , they said , followed an argument between the two girls , which ‘ exploded into violence ’ with @entity18 under the influence of drugs			1
statements by @entity69 , taken by police , said that @entity14 had previously accused @entity18 of taking money from her room			1
court papers conclude that miss @entity14 must have had ' multiple aggressors ' and her death was not solely down to @entity3 ( file pic ) and on the night of the murder these tensions came to a head when @entity1 let @entity81 , an acquaintance who had a history of petty crime , into the house , the judges said			1
‘ because the accused were high and because of the level of tension between the girls , it exploded into violence			0
’ during the attack it was @entity81 who held @entity3 back , while @entity1 slit her throat , the reasoning said			0
@entity32 also held a knife			2
‘ the dna on her wrists and inside @entity3 lead us to say that @entity81 during the attack was not holding a knife but had his hands free which he used to carry out sexual violence and to help to immobilise the girl			0
’ of two knives used in the murder , the smaller one , which produced the wound on the right side of the neck , was held by @entity115 , it said			2
‘ the blade which produced the wound on the left side of the neck , from which most of the blood emerged and which caused the death of @entity3 , was held by @entity1 , ’ the court report said			2
the judgment reinstated two crucial pieces of dna evidence discredited in the original appeal court that let @entity18 and @entity32 walk free			1
the amount of @entity97 on the alleged murder weapon , a kitchen knife seized from @entity32 ’s house which had traces of miss @entity14 on the blade , was then disputed as too small			1
papers say that @entity18 killed miss @entity14 , and was backed up by boyfriend @entity32 ( pictured ) and the court found dna on miss @entity14 ’s bra strap belonging to @entity115 could have been the result of contamination			1
but in the latest judgment the court confirmed that the kitchen knife ‘ had the victim ’s dna on the blade … and was the same knife used by @entity1 to stab @entity3 in the left side of the neck , in so causing the only mortal wound ’			0
the court accepted that @entity32 ’s dna was on @entity3 ’s bra , leaving them ‘ in no doubt that @entity1 and @entity115 were in the house that night ’			2
@entity6 ’s highest court must now confirm the conviction			0
then @entity6 will attempt to extradite @entity18 but their chances of success are minimal , diplomatic sources say			2
