by @entity0 published : 02:47 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 02:47 est , 17 october 2012 media mogul @entity1 swatted away a shareholder revolt at @entity4 's annual general meeting last night			1
a motion for the 81 - year - old to step down as chairman of @entity9 ’s parent company was easily defeated in a vote at the @entity12 meeting			1
other attempts to diminish the @entity15 ’s control also failed in the wake of the company ’s huge 44 per cent share increase over the past year			1
powerful : the motion to remove the wealthy @entity20 from his post as @entity4 chairman was easily defeated there was no mention of the £ 7million former @entity9 chief @entity26 reportedly received when she resigned at the height of the phone hacking crisis in july last year			1
the meeting also failed to discuss claims that @entity32 was being lined up for a top job in charge of @entity35 in the @entity36 despite the uproar over his handling of the scandal in @entity40			1
mr @entity1 made his feelings clear in a @entity42 posting in the run - up to the meeting , declaring that ‘ any shareholders with complaints should take profits and sell ! ’ ‘ if you do n’t like it , do n’t buy the stock , ’ he added in one flinty exchange with a shareholder yesterday			2
referring to the scandal that resulted in the closure of the @entity56 and the arrest of @entity59 journalists , the @entity20 tycoon admitted at the meeting that the company had ‘ mishaps			1
’ but he insisted @entity4 had ‘ seized the opportunity to make amends			1
’ @entity9 has now been dogged by the accusations of phone hacking at its newspapers for years			2
' golden goodbye ' : there was no mention at the meeting of @entity26 ' £ 7million pay - off when she resigned over the phone hacking scandal at @entity9 tabloid the @entity56 now - defunct tabloid the @entity56 allegedly conspired to hack the voicemail of celebrities and even the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl @entity78 in 2002			1

executives and journalists from @entity9 publication @entity59 have also been arrested over the allegations			0
despite the scandal , @entity82 was awarded a bumper pay - off when she resigned over the allegations , it emerged yesterday			0
the sum is thought to have consisted of cash and pension payments as well as an allowance for legal fees and the use of a chauffeur - driven car			0
the award - much higher than the £ 1.7m cash pay - out previously reported - looked set to rile investors at today 's meeting			2
mr @entity1 's words last night did not stop some institutional investors from demanding changes in the way @entity4 is run , but there was no rebellion of the kind he faced at last year ’s meeting at the height of the scandal , when he again overcame calls for his ouster			0
on trial : @entity82 , pictured leaving the @entity119 with her husband @entity120 , who is also charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice his critics did get their chance to speak at yesterday ’s meeting on the @entity35 film studio lot – but only after he had announced that their motions had already been outvoted			2
@entity129 , of @entity130 , said it was a ‘ conflict of interests ’ for mr @entity1 to serve both as chairman and as chief executive officer			0

’ @entity143 , of the @entity40 @entity144 , supported the move to strip mr @entity1 of the chairmanship			0
‘ i ’d like to thank you very much for making us a lot of money – but this wo n’t go away as an issue , ’ he added			0
even though the @entity1 family owns 13 per cent of the equity in the company , it still controls 40 per cent of the voting stock			1
prince @entity158 , a @entity160 investor and a strong supporter of mr @entity1 , owns an additional seven per cent of the voting stock , making any real changes almost impossible without the chairman ’s acquiescence			1
after the 80 - minute meeting , mr @entity1 and his board of directors left without a serious blow being landed			0
they even got a round of applause .			0
