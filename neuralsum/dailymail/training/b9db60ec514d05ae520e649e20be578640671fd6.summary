harmful : making young girls wear pink reinforces gender stereotypes , according to an educational expert making girls wear pink is wrong and could harm their future , an education expert has warned			1
@entity8 , a spokesman for a private schools ' organisation , said the idea of having blue for a boy and pink for a girl is ' pernicious ' because it leads them towards certain roles regardless of their real identities			1
she said : ' there will be those who say that pink and blue colour coding does not matter - that it is just a fact that boys like blue and girls like pink			1
' she added : ' if we designate a particular colour to a gender , it leads us to designate all manner of other things by gender too			2
' the result is girls and boys read different kinds of books , play with different kinds of toys , study different subjects , consider different occupations , have different roles within the workplace and family and are ultimately valued differently by society			1
' what is pernicious about this is that everyone is then attributed with roles and characteristics regardless of their individual identities and talents			0
and this then occurs before a child is even born			0
' writing in the magazine @entity60 , produced by the @entity61 , she writes that , at the time of the @entity64 , the colours were reversed			0
according to a 1918 edition of @entity66 , the rule at the time was pink for the boy and blue for the girl			2
@entity73 was considered a softer colour which was prettier for girls , and also the colour in which the @entity76 was often depicted			2
ms @entity8 , the association 's communications manager , wrote : ' most of us want a society in which people are judged according to their whole identities rather than just their gender			0
modern phenomenon : girls clothing is increasingly only available in pink shades - but a century ago , the colour was associated with boys ' we can only have a hope of this if we stop presuming an array of character traits - starting on the basis of colour preference - go hand in hand with a person 's biological sex			1
' ms @entity8 spoke out after the parents ' group @entity99 launched a campaign to remove ' boys and girls ' signs in shops			1
@entity107 and @entity106 are among those who have already pledged to make its toys ' gender neutral '			0
as previously reported in @entity111 , @entity99 was set up by a group of @entity114 parents in november 2012 , calling for a change in the way toys are marketed to boys and girls			0
they had noticed girls were increasingly being encouraged to play with dolls , prams and kitchens - all inevitably in pink colours - while toys deems to be for boys were cars , guns and sports - related			1
colour - coding babies : this gives them roles and characteristics regardless of their individual identities and talents from birth one of the campaign 's founders , @entity141 , 44 , a self - employed copywriter from @entity142 , who has a six - year - old daughter , told the @entity111 : ' it does bother a lot of parents , we seem to have tapped in to a huge and growing sense of frustration with the way toys are promoted according to outdated , illogical and sexist stereotypes			1
' i ca n't speak for any of the others but what pushed me to make a stand was the realisation , after my daughter was born , that gender stereotyping in children 's products had become worse than when i was a child myself back in the @entity161			0
it 's something that has become almost impossible to escape and is very limiting for children			0
' a similar @entity165 , calling for reading material not to be marked as ' for boys ' or ' for girls ' is backed by children 's laureate @entity169 , poet laureate @entity170 and the author @entity171 .			2

@entity8 said pink for girls and blue for boys is ' pernicious '
she said colour - coding reinforces gender stereotypes
leads to children playing with different toys and reading different books
when they grow up , they will consider different occupations
in 1918 , blue was considered a *feminine* shade
