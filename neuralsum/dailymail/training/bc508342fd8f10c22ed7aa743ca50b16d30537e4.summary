by @entity0 published : 07:07 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 09:08 est , 23 july 2013 as the heatwave engulfing @entity3 shows no signs of abating , it seems men are seeking new ways to stay cool in the office			2
rather than sweating it out in a full suit , men are opting for smart , tailored shorts that can be teamed with a shirt and jacket			0
this @entity15 type look has become so popular that some shops are reporting over a 200 per cent rise in sales from last year			2
@entity19 have seen a risei n sales of over 200 per cent on last years figuresd			1
pictured are the @entity23 twill shorts , £ 45 as temperatures reached the mid-thirties last week , @entity19 reported their best ever week for short sales , with sales of smart shorts up a massive 226 per cent on last year ( not entirely surprising , given the cool summer we endured ) , and 33 per cent higher than the previous bestselling week			1
the trend for above - the - knee shorts was a major look at @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 on the spring / summer 13 catwalks and , since then , tailored shorts have begun surfacing as officewear for overheated city dwellers , whether worn with a casual polo shirt or as part of a smart suit			2
this trend sees a move away from the short - shorts craze that has been adopted by stars like @entity47			1
last week high street sales data revealed that demand for men ’s shorts that sit at the top of thighs , rather than knees had shot up by 156 per cent in the previous week alone			1
the tailored shorts evoke a slightly more sophisticated feel : more elegant post-work cocktails on the terrace than dodgy @entity59 throwback , and is the sort of look that will see @entity3 men looking cool yet chic in the workplace and beyond			0
the high street has quickly adapted to cater to this trend and wide ranges of tailored shorts are available at shops from @entity68 to @entity69 at @entity70			0
@entity71 £ 19.50 , teamed with @entity72 £ 49.50 , @entity73 £ 12.50 , and @entity74 £ 49.50 , all from @entity68 the current best - selling styles at @entity19 include the private label chino , belted cargo and linen short styles in reds , bright blues and greens – adding a real point of difference and to some , a controversial twist to the ‘ office ’ look			1
@entity90 , @entity91 at @entity19 , says , ‘ last week alone , shorts sales rose by 52 per cent , week on week			1
‘ the tailored short offers our male customer a stylish sartorial solution and alternative to the traditional trouser that maintains a level of cool for summer			0
‘ our customers are dressing up their shorts with brogues , desert boots and loafers for a more formal look in the office			0
’ @entity109 crew @entity107 , £ 14 @entity70 @entity110 with belt , £ 15.99 - 29.99 from @entity112 @entity113 : £ 24.00 @entity19 @entity114 , @entity115 ( £ 35 ) @entity118 @entity117 casual twill shorts , 18 , @entity119 @entity120 , @entity121 , £ 35			0

@entity19 have seen sales over 200 per cent higher than last year
last weeks sales were *36* per cent higher than previous highest week
more chic than the current trend for super short - shorts for men
