manning is the @entity34 private charged with the biggest leak of classified information in @entity5 history			0
however , being nominated does n't necessarily say anything about a candidate 's chances			2

favourite : @entity8 is a human rights activist who became @entity9 president in december earlier this month a @entity74 authority that oversees foundations in @entity76 - including the @entity77 - said it would investigate whether the peace committee is complying with @entity80 's will			1

@entity104 , the director of the @entity106 , and a prominent voice in the @entity80 guessing game , said his favourite for the 2012 award was @entity111			2
he is an @entity5 scholar and advocate of non-violence cited as an inspiration for the @entity115 and other protests			1
giving the prize to him would be a way for the committee to address criticism			2
mr @entity104 's other top picks were ms @entity12 and the @entity124 human rights group , and @entity127 religious leaders @entity125 and @entity128			1
he said they have ‘ spoken out against the misuse of religion in legitimating conflict ’			0

could be honoured : former @entity11 prime minister @entity10 , left , and @entity13 human rights activist @entity12 , right , are believed to be among the candidates the wave of @entity115 protests began in @entity9 and swept across @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity62 and most recently @entity151 , where president @entity152 has cracked down ferociously on his opponents			1
the protests got a nod from the @entity80 committee in 2011 , when @entity62 protest leader ms @entity61 shared the prize with ms sirleaf and ms @entity60			2
mr @entity136 said the @entity160 freedom drive remained the world 's most acute conflict and was far from exhausted as a @entity80 theme			0
‘ there are still 34 or 35 armed conflicts in the world and i think they ( the committee ) have to get back to recognising heroes of conflict resolution or people working for the victims of war , ’ he said			0
‘ there are many prizes for good deeds in the world , but only one price for peace of this size and format			0
’ the @entity80 also include awards in medicine , physics , chemistry and literature			0
