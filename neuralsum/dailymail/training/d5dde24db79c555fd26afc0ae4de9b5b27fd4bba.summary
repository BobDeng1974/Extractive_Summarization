by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter after fleeing a city tower block in search of the good life , @entity3 and @entity4 spent five years sleeping in a tent and living off the land in a bid to build @entity12 ’s greenest home			1
armed with an axe and hand tools , they pieced together scrap metal , tyres and wooden crates until a one - bedroom cabin – complete with compost toilet – rose out of the muddy field they had bought			1
now the couple have been served with an enforcement notice to tear it all down – because it was against their eco-friendly beliefs to apply for planning permission			1
eco-palace : @entity3 and @entity4 's home , called @entity30 , took five years to build country retreat : ms @entity32 , left , and mr @entity3 , right , left @entity33 five years ago to embark on their project planning row : officials from @entity38 have now said that the home must be torn down ( @entity41 ) convenience : the couple have an outdoor compost toilet they argue that the process would have wasted too much paper and energy			1
mr @entity3 , 34 , said : ‘ we wanted to build a home that would let us truly live as one with nature			1
‘ the process was a lot slower but it was extremely satisfying			0
we wanted to reduce carbon emissions as much as possible			0
we took the decision to build without planning permission because the council ’s procedure is not environmentally friendly enough and it goes against our personal principles			2
’ five years ago , mr @entity3 and 54 - year - old partner @entity32 left jobs as carers and moved out of the tower block in @entity62 , north @entity33 , where they were living			1
they bought a 20 - acre field in @entity66 , @entity67 , put aside £ 20,000 for construction costs , and set about scouring farmland and scrap yards for unwanted materials which they could use to build their home			1
inside : the couple prepare a meal in their eco-home 's kitchen heating : mr @entity3 stokes with wood - burning stove to keep the house warm attic room : the two pose in the bedroom of their painstakingly - contructed home , made in part from scrap happy scrubbing : the couple 's bathroom gets heated water from a wood - fired tank at one with nature : the couple keeps ducks , which provide eggs , and also have sheep for wool and a vegetable plot they built foundations out of tractor tyres filled with gravel and used haulage pallets and railway sleepers to construct the walls and roof			1
today the house is made up of just one bedroom , a living room , kitchen and bathroom			0
water is drawn out of the ground via a bore hole and they use an outdoor compost toilet			1
and just like @entity117 and @entity118 from @entity120 sitcom @entity121 they grown their own fruit and veg and rear animals – ducks for their eggs and sheep for their wool			0
because they have no electricity , they keep their food cool in an underground ‘ fridge ’ – a compartment dug two and a half feet deep			2
the couple say their neighbours were initially supportive of their ambition to live self - sufficiently			0
they were relying on locals not alerting the council to their project so they would be given automatic planning permission after four years			2
but two years into the build , the couple say locals changed their tune when they revealed plans to run an eco-friendly retreat and host green workshops in their field			2
under construction : the couple built the house , pictured during the process , without using any power tools order : @entity38 in @entity67 have told the couple they must tear the house down handiwork : mr @entity3 and ms @entity32 decided against using power tools for the whole of the five - year construction period @entity164 : the wood to make the house was partly sourced from old lorry crates a neighbour gathered ten signatures and submitted the petition to @entity38			1
mr @entity3 and @entity32 appealed against the first enforcement notice three years ago and are now in the process of appealing against the second one			1
mr @entity3 , who earns a living selling homemade produce and doing part - time care work , said : ‘ what we ’ve done is n’t illegal			2
‘ we ’ve had a lot of drama with the neighbours			0
some have been really supportive while others have gone against us and started a petition			0
‘ the idea of the conservation project was to provide retreat accommodation and run courses and workshops on sustainable living			0
the house and surrounding land enables us to be totally self - sufficient			0
this life is not for everyone but we love it			0
we would be devastated if we had to knock down			0
’ a council spokesman said : ‘ i can confirm @entity38 has served an enforcement notice that they remove the structure			2
‘ however , as it has now gone to appeal , we have to wait for the inspector ’s decision before we can take any further action			0

@entity3 , 34 , and @entity4 , 54 , left @entity33 five years ago to build their dream house in the *countryside*
they used railway sleepers , lorry tyres and scrap metal to build up the house , and used no power tools
home has an outdoor compost toilet , no power or running water , and an underground *pantry* instead of a fridge
the couple are now *facing* an order from @entity38 in @entity67 to tear down their home after complaints
they decided not to apply for planning permissions because the process uses up too much paper and electricity
