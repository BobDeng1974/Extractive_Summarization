the @entity13 - based model , pictured in a plus - size campaign ( left ) and as she is today ( right ) , was secretly ' repulsed ' by her body , so she checked into a military - style fitness camp and lost three stone before she lost the weight , @entity5 , seen in her plus - size prime , scored a number of high profile campaigns , which could earn as much as £ 2,000 for a day 's shoot as a size 16 or size 18 impressive results : in spite of this , she knew she would never be happy unless she got into shape once and for all , so she checked into no 1 @entity22 ' now i have the body that i always wanted , i hope to get work as a slimmer model			1

@entity5 appeared in promotions for @entity75 names like @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , who were keen to target customers of all sizes			2
but despite her success as a model , @entity5 had been battling her weight for years , fluctuating between 13 and 14 stone			1
