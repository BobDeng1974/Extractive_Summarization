@entity1 's upturn in fortunes and the absence of @entity4 makes @entity5 confident of causing an upset at title - chasing @entity7 this week			1
@entity9 's honeymoon period at the @entity11 helm did not last too long , with the pressure ratcheting up thanks in no small part to four defeats in six league matches on home turf			2
it was a miserable record which looked set to extend when @entity19 put @entity20 ahead early in sunday 's match , although efforts from @entity23 and @entity24 secured @entity1 a much - needed 2 - 1 win			1
@entity42 's men have been mightily impressive this term , so much so that going through the season unbeaten looks realistic , but @entity5 believes the suspension of star turn @entity4 offers a glimmer of light			1
' we 're full of confidence , ' the striker said			2
' obviously we are coming off three wins in a row now in all competitions , so we 'll take that confidence into the game on wednesday			1
' we 're looking to get the result			0
obviously @entity7 are going to be trying to do the same at home , but they are missing their main man up front			1
so they have to change a few things , and we 're feeling good			2
' the @entity7 game is not the be-all or end - all , but it would add to the great momentum we have at the moment if we could beat them			1
' that is what we want to do and we will give ourselves the best possible chance			0
' @entity5 ( left ) is confident @entity1 can upset @entity42 's team on wednesday as well as an upturn in results , @entity1 head to @entity29 buoyed by an improved team display			1
the @entity9 revolution has yet to fulfil expectations at a club symptomatic with style but on sunday the team played in the high - pressing , attacking manner he became known for at @entity81			1
' we have been working hard , getting our shape together and sliding together , pressing high up the pitch , ' @entity5 said			1
' i thought we did that well today and obviously it worked well because we got the result in the end			0
' we have been working on it recently			0
we 're getting used to it more , getting fitter			0
@entity92 to read the latest ahead of the big match at @entity29 ' i thought the lads worked very hard			1
you saw in the first half we were out of the blocks , trying to get the ball back high up the pitch and that 's how we got our second goal			0
' that winning effort was a particularly important moment for everyone connected with @entity1 , given it brought @entity24 's 593 - minute wait for a goal to an end			1
' i am delighted for @entity24 to get his goal , ' @entity5 said of his team - mate			1
' he has been a tad unlucky in the recent games , so it means a lot to him to get on the scoresheet			0
' obviously the lads are very happy for him and hopefully he can push on and get a few more			0
' while @entity1 ready themselves for the short trip to west @entity118 , @entity20 will look to get back to winning ways when @entity120 visit on wednesday			1
the defeat at @entity11 ended an eight - match unbeaten streak in all competitions , after which manager @entity125 lamented a lack of fortune			2
@entity24 ( centre ) scored against @entity20 to ensure @entity1 are back in top form @entity130 offered no excuses , though , playing down the absence of injured midfielder @entity133 and the influence of thursday 's @entity136 match in @entity137			1
' we ca n't expect to win every game , ' the @entity20 defender told the @entity141			0
' it 's a tough place to come			0
' i do n't think you can just point your finger at thursday night - they are tired as well			2
' it 's easy to read it that way but this is the @entity33			2
' we can change this feeling quickly			0
that 's the beauty of the @entity33			2
we ca n't dwell on it too much			0
' we have to learn from our mistakes and then move on and be ready			0
there are lots of games coming			0
