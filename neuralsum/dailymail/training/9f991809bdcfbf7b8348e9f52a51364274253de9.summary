by @entity0 published : 08:39 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 04:57 est , 19 march 2013 a dictrict council wants to ban apostrophes from street signs to ‘ reduce potential confusion ’			1
unsurprisingly , @entity6 officials were unable to explain what trouble could arise from correct use of punctuation			1
and they admitted that the the apostrophe purge has been pursued unofficially for years			0
banned : existing apostrophes such as @entity12 in @entity6 will not be changed but no new signs will be permitted to use such punctuation official guidance : @entity16 said in future all road signs should avoid using punctuation entirely too difficult : a local proofreader said it was as if punctuation is being ' erased ' from public consciousness @entity6 has issued new guidance for street naming which says ' all punctuation , including apostrophes , shall be avoided			1
' the authority argues the policy will ' eliminate ' any potential confusion in the event of an emergency			1
new streets have not contained apostrophes for many years but the guidance is now being made official , it added			2
residents and plain @entity39 campaigners have criticised the decision but the council said apostrophes could only be found in three existing street names in the district			1
@entity46 @entity45 said abandoning apostrophes was a ' backward step ' it added that @entity50 and @entity12 both in @entity51 and @entity52 in @entity53 were all named ' many , many years ago '			1
@entity54 , from @entity6 , said there was no national guidance that stops apostrophes being used			1
but proofreader @entity45 from @entity58 hit out at the decision			2
' it 's almost as though somebody with a giant eraser is literally trying to erase punctuation from our consciousness , ' she said			0
' to me there 's something terribly @entity69 and terribly reassuring about well - written and well - punctuated writing			0
' some may say i should get a life and get out more but if i got out more and saw place names with no apostrophes where there should be i shudder to think how i 'd react			2
' ms @entity45 said while she accepted language had to evolve in her opinion the council 's decision was a backward step			1
@entity80 from the @entity81 said punctuation including the apostrophe was one of the basic rules of language and he described the council 's decision as nonsensical			0
local residents reacted furiously to the move			1
commenting on @entity90 said : ' if the @entity16 stop using it correctly , people are never going to learn ! ' is it because the people they employ are not sure where it goes either ? ' @entity98 said : ' finally ! i 've been going around for years complaining to my husband about abysmal punctuation , and @entity39 is n't even my first language			2
' @entity103 posted : ' i think the decision shows that the council is confused about the proper use of @entity39			0
use it or lose it			0
' tricky : incorrect use of apostrophes is a common occurrence but does that mean they should be banned ? confusing ? in future all @entity6 road signs in the district will have to be more like this baffling : residents slammed @entity16 for issuing the bizarre guidance extinct : campaigners say the apostrophe is one of the basic rules of the @entity39 language @entity126 posted : ' bad grammar , spelling and punctuation really annoy me			1
' i can remember when at school in the 60 's that it was a major part of our @entity39 education			0
our teachers would mark our books in red pen with the corrections in the margins			0
' the thing you dreaded the most was the ' see me ' comment at the end ! ' @entity145 posted : ' it irritates me no end when people use apostrophes like glitter to be scattered randomly around			2
' a statement from @entity16 said : ' our proposed policy on street naming and numbering covers a whole host of practical issues , many of which are aimed at reducing potential confusion over street names			0
' horror show : a classic example of apostrophes being misused @entity164			0

@entity6 says no new signs can contain apostrophes
argues they could cause ' confusion ' in an emergency situation
wo n't change existing signs such as @entity50 and @entity12
local proofreader @entity176 slams move as ' backward step '
