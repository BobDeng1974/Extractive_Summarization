@entity0 has declared he sees no impediments to him returning to take a hands - on role at @entity5			1
the @entity7 - based businessman has requisitioned the @entity9 board for an egm at which he , @entity11 and @entity12 hope to replace chairman @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity16 placemen @entity15 and @entity17			1
the current incumbents are resisting the request though , and have asked the regulator of the @entity21 to rule @entity0 unsuitable for directorship on account of his 41 contraventions of @entity25			1
@entity0 ( above ) sees no impediment to him being able to return to a hands - on role at @entity5 @entity5 chairman @entity13 ( left ) with @entity15 ( right ) @entity0 previously agreed to pay the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) £ 40m as part of a settlement and was fined £ 186,000 rather than face 84 years in prison			1
as well as satisfying the @entity34 of his suitability to take up a directorial role , @entity0 , who served on the @entity5 board , must also pass the @entity40 ’s fit and proper person criteria which takes a dim view of criminal convictions and association with insolvency over the past five years			1
recent reports in his adopted country pertaining to the discovery of unlawful activity within @entity30 had raised questions over the validity of the investigation that led to what @entity0 this week described as a ‘ favourable tax settlement ’			1
but , citing the fact he is already executive chairman of a public company , @entity0 on wednesday waived his right to see that matter reopened by launching a staunch defence of his credentials			1
@entity16 ( left ) appointed his associate @entity15 ( right ) as @entity5 chief executive in december a statement on his behalf read : ‘ there has been media coverage in the @entity66 following a report in the @entity7 @entity68 that dealt with the suspension of senior managers of the @entity7 revenue services ( @entity30 ) for allegedly operating a rogue intelligence unit that spied on senior politicians and businessmen			1
i am named in the report as one of the business people who was spied on			0
‘ it was suggested in the @entity68 report that this unlawful activity by @entity30 could put many of the recently concluded tax settlements at risk - mine included			2
this is an obvious conclusion for the journalist to reach			0
if @entity30 obtained information unlawfully and such information was used to coerce settlement with me ( or any other taxpayer ) then i could apply to have my settlement set aside			0
according to my advice that is the correct legal position			0
‘ for the avoidance of doubt i wish to make my position clear			0
i will not be making an application to have my settlement reviewed and / or set aside for two reasons : off - field politics have prompted numerous protests from @entity5 fans this season ' 1			1
my settlement resulted from prolonged and robust litigation that was fully in the public arena			0
there was no information produced or used by @entity30 that was unlawfully gained and , in my opinion , the individuals i dealt with at @entity30 acted in good faith - both during and after my settlement negotiations			2
i consequently have no legal basis to argue for the review and setting aside of my settlement			0
even if my legal team could make out a case for review i would not pursue it			0
i am happy with the settlement and the opportunity this created for me to lead a normal business and personal life			0
my business interests have performed very strongly post-settlement with the @entity7 government by far my largest customer			2
i am also able to enjoy my role as executive chairman of a public company without the integrity issues that previously dogged me			2
' importantly , i also now have sufficient time and resources to invest in getting @entity5 back on track			2
’ the future of the @entity129 giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems			0

@entity0 does not see any reason for him not to return to @entity5
@entity7 - based businessman wants a hands - on role at the club
but he has 41 contraventions of @entity7 income tax law
@entity0 wants himself , @entity11 and @entity12 on the @entity5 board
he wants to replace @entity16 *'s* men , @entity15 and @entity17
