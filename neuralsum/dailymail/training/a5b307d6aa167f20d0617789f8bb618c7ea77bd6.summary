by @entity0 published : 16:05 est , 19 may 2012 updated : 05:54 est , 20 may 2012 her career as an @entity4 expert for the @entity5 had taken @entity6 to many exotic locations , but the tiny island of @entity9 captured her heart			1
divorced , and with her son @entity12 almost grown up , it seemed like the ideal time to make a fresh start and build her dream home – so she decided to sell her house in @entity18 to pay for a plot of land on a hillside overlooking the @entity22			1
her new life appeared to be complete when she fell in love with and married @entity25 , a @entity26 17 years younger than her			2
he was the muscular young builder she had employed to construct her house			2
tragically , however , @entity6 , 50 , died in hospital earlier this month in circumstances that have prompted the local police to open a criminal investigation			1
secret wedding : @entity6 , her hair in dreadlocks , married @entity25 in 2009 - she did n't tell her family she was marrying him @entity9 police commissioner @entity36 said yesterday : ' as far as i know , no arrest has been made			1
the matter is still under investigation and we are still working with the hospital authorities towards determining an exact cause of death			0
' a post-mortem examination has been conducted but further work is required			0
we are intending to speak to several people in connection with this matter and one of those will be her husband			0
' now her heartbroken parents have revealed the extent to which her dream of happiness on the paradise island turned into a nightmare			2
in phone calls home , a disturbing picture of @entity6 's life emerged that alarmed her elderly parents			1
she claimed she had been defrauded over the purchase of her land and then blocked by the police from taking any action			1
she discovered that the person who sold her the land was not the only person who claimed ownership of the plot			2
and after completing her £ 120,000 home , she faced voodoo - style intimidation – with dead animals left outside her house			1
@entity6 's married life appeared equally troubling , with stories of domestic violence and hospital treatment emerging within a year of the 2009 wedding and a petition for divorce being filed by her last year			1
investigation : commissioner @entity36 said no arrest has been made her 80 - year - old mother , @entity86 , said : ' she rang me regularly to say what was happening and it worried us terribly			2
' i do n't know how much money she lost over the sale , but it was a lot			0
she tried to get the police involved , but they would n't let her press charges			2
' then several neighbours – who had been very pleasant when she first moved in , even asking her to read a eulogy at a funeral – claimed to be descendants of the original owner of the land and said they were entitled to a payment			2
she spent a fortune in local courts establishing she had the right to sell the house she had built			2
' the judgment in her favour did not end local resentment in the tiny village of @entity113 , a poor community of 60 houses mostly built of tin			0
according to her mother , @entity6 's life ' turned very nasty indeed '			1
@entity9 is predominantly @entity119 but as is the case in many former @entity122 and @entity123 colonies , some of its 166,000 inhabitants also practise a form of voodoo called @entity129 and they directed these dark forces against the @entity131 in the house on the hill			1
her mother , who lives with husband @entity134 in @entity135 , near @entity136 in the @entity137 , said : ' @entity6 told me there had been dead dogs and cats left in her garden as a warning			1
' she said it was a form of voodoo designed to intimidate her and she was very frightened			2
' by this stage , her marriage was offering little comfort and neighbours said they regularly heard arguments coming from the marital home			0
when @entity6 wed in june 2009 , she kept it a secret from her family			1
the nuptials were witnessed by the groom 's parents and her best friend			0
wearing a tight - fitting floral dress , she had her hair dreadlocked @entity161 - style and looked a picture of happiness as she pledged herself to her smiling suitor			1
but within a year , 5ft 1in @entity6 was in hospital and filing charges of assault against her new husband			1
@entity134 , 79 , a retired professor of engineering , said : ' she said she had been in hospital over a week			0
she had pictures taken of her injuries so she could prove how bad it was			0
at @entity174 that year @entity173 brought his five - year - old daughter to visit @entity176 when @entity6 was spending time here with @entity12 but we refused to meet him			1
' we took the little girl out but we wanted nothing to do with him after what he was supposed to have done			0
' @entity6 was an attractive , outgoing woman			1
we wished she 'd ditch him and find somebody normal			0
' @entity6 initially pressed charges against @entity25 for grievous bodily harm but these were withdrawn in january 2011 when the matter went before magistrates			1
dream home : but @entity6 's house on the hill caused legal disputes with locals in april last year , she filed for divorce on the grounds , acceptable in @entity9 , that the marriage had lasted less than five years and @entity173 moved out			1
but this was not the end of the relationship			0
according to @entity6 's mother , while her daughter was away on one of her frequent foreign trips @entity173 would move back into the house			1
whether it was the loneliness of a single life in a tiny , hostile community where the only shop is a dilapidated caravan selling cold drinks , or the fear of failing at a second marriage , @entity6 's feelings for @entity173 remained strong and she kept seeing him			1
then , last month , @entity6 was readmitted to the island 's general hospital			1
a day later she suffered a stroke and a heart attack			0
her son @entity12 , 18 , and her sister @entity221 , 49 , flew out to be at her bedside but after two weeks in a coma she suffered respiratory failure and died on may 4			0
initially , the death was described by the police as a ' tragic accident ' and due to ' natural causes ' but last week @entity229 revealed that officers had changed their minds and had made it a criminal investigation			0
the news that their daughter 's death was being viewed as suspicious by the authorities has caused anguish to her parents			0
her father said : ' to think she still wanted to go back to that man is very painful for us to bear			0
the entire venture had been a nightmare			0
' @entity6 had always been very successful			1
she 's always been a good provider and earned enough to send her son to boarding school , but in @entity9 she went from a position of being quite well - off to one where she was constantly having to ask for our help			0
revealed : how the @entity229 reported @entity6 's death last week it seems that while they welcome foreigners over there as tourists , it is fatal for that tourist to be so attracted to the place that they acquire land			1
' her mother added : ' we just want the @entity9 police to investigate it properly			0
@entity6 loved @entity9 – the climate , the countryside and the people – and i think she felt utterly let down			2
' she was a friend to the whole world and had dedicated her life to going to poor places and making a difference to their health needs			0
' i really want to know why she died , and if anyone is responsible for it then i hope they are hunted down so they do n't ever have the chance to do it again			0
' @entity6 's death comes less than five months after another @entity131 , lawyer @entity282 , 46 , who also married an islander , fell 100ft from a cliff to her death			2
her family accepted the police verdict that it was an accident			0
@entity25 could not be reached for comment .			0
