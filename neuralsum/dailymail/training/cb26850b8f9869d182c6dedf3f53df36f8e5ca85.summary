by @entity0 published : 17:04 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 17:05 est , 7 june 2012 the head of the @entity2 has demanded a huge drive to recruit more ethnic minority and women soldiers			1
general sir @entity6 said military chiefs had been ‘ unsuccessful ’ at ensuring the forces reflected the make - up of @entity11 society			1
the chief of the general staff said the @entity2 could reach full strength only by getting better at recruiting from ethnic communities , who make up 29 per cent of young people of fighting age , and women			1
important : @entity2 recruits from ethnic communities make up 29 per cent of young people of fighting age			1
sir @entity6 said the @entity2 had to get better attracting such recruits and women the country ’s top soldier said : ‘ for a long time we have been trying to get the balance in the @entity2 across the piece , including female soldiers , more in kilter with the make - up of @entity11 society			1
‘ we have made strenuous efforts in the past to correct this imbalance , without startling success			0
‘ those who are serving from different ethnicities in the @entity2 are making a huge contribution on a day - to - day basis and on operations			1
we need to acquire more of them			0
’ in december , the @entity42 broke with 100 years of tradition to allow women to serve on submarines for the first time			0
general @entity6 says there could be significant ‘ side benefits ’ from boosting recruitment , especially from @entity52 communities and places from where there is a terror threat			1
benefits : general @entity6 says there could be significant ¿ side benefits ¿ from boosting recruitment , especially from @entity52 communities and places from where there is a terror threat the @entity2 was ‘ very proud ’ of soldiers from foreign and @entity71 countries who had joined up , but recruitment ‘ at home ’ was vital to ensure the force was at full strength			1
general @entity6 ’s comments to a conference organised by the @entity76 think - tank , echoed those made last month by @entity78 when he indicated regiments with significant numbers of soldiers from @entity71 countries would be abolished or merged			1
the defence secretary said the most vulnerable units were those that failed to recruit their full complement of soldiers in @entity11 and made up their numbers from @entity88 and the @entity89			2
the @entity2 will be downsized from 102,000 personnel to 82,000 by 2020 in an effort to cut costs			2
the @entity93 will inform another 2,900 soldiers as early as next tuesday that they are to be axed , shrinking @entity2 numbers to 97,000 – their lowest since the @entity96			1
about 1,000 posts will be axed in the @entity98 and 300 in the @entity42			0
@entity100 mp @entity99 , a former commander of @entity11 troops in @entity102 , warned the cuts would see the @entity2 reduced to little more than a home guard			2
he said : ‘ @entity2 used to be defined by being 100,000 - strong			2
if it is less than that , some people argue it is a self - defence force			0
we will certainly carry less clout in the world			0
’ mr @entity78 is poised for a bitter backlash over plans to slash the number of @entity2 regiments			2
women wanted : women like teritorial army soldier @entity117 , pictured , could make a big difference to @entity11 forces fighting abroad the last cavalry regiment in @entity121 , the @entity123 @entity122 , has already launched a campaign to save itself from the chop			0
@entity126 , whose son @entity127 , 31 , died in @entity128 serving with the unit , said : ‘ my son would turn in his grave if he could know what was going on and be doing the same as me – standing up to bureaucracy , standing up for @entity121 life			0
’ @entity136 defence spokesman @entity135 accused mr @entity78 of ‘ presiding over decline , not planning for the future ’			0
he said : ‘ the government plans to plug self - made capability gaps rather than reform our forces for the future			0
