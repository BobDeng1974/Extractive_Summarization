by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 seemed perfectly at ease on wednesday as he peacefully practised at @entity4 with his new team headed by @entity6 – seemingly immune to the pressures of next week			1
he did so having been boosted by confirmation that @entity4 ’s unique seeding formula had bumped him up from his ranking of fifth to third position in friday ’s draw , providing some kind of insulation			1
this was guaranteed , leaving him to enjoy the day ’s highlight of a 200 metre race at a nearby running track between his fitness coach @entity20 and @entity22 , coach of @entity23			0
the whole team plus interested onlookers piled over to @entity26 to see @entity22 win by a close head			0
wait is over : @entity2 reacts after becoming the first @entity30 winner at @entity4 since 1936 standing tall : @entity2 celebrates his historic @entity4 victory as he his applauded by the crowd golden moment : @entity2 beat @entity33 ( right ) to win his first @entity4 title last year @entity35 pulls out of @entity4 warm - up the atmosphere may be more serious come tomorrow morning when the draw was made , but at least @entity2 knows that he will not have to face his three main challengers – @entity33 , @entity40 or @entity41 – until the semi-finals			1
it means that @entity2 ’s theoretical quarter final opponent would be one of @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 or @entity49 , yet it is all ifs and buts			2
the mathematical formula , which rewards grass court performances of men from the previous two years , saw to his promotion , while relegating @entity56 champion @entity46 down to number five			0
the @entity58 , a first round loser in 2013 , has reacted phlegmatically to the prospect , and in any case he has bigger concerns are being struck down by a heavy fever earlier this week			0
when @entity4 next year goes to having a three week gap between the @entity65 and @entity66 it is likely to heighten debate about whether the formula is necessary at all in an era when baseliners can play perfectly well on the grass			1
second best : @entity73 @entity40 has been seeded second for @entity4 too strong : @entity40 celebrates beating @entity2 at the @entity65 earlier this month collision course ? @entity2 and @entity40 are on the same side of the @entity4 draw and could clash @entity77 : @entity78 has been backed by @entity79 to impress at @entity4 already there is a fundamental inconsistency with the tournament reserving the right to alter the women ’s seedings , something they did yesterday by inserting @entity87 and @entity88 into the number eight slot in the doubles			1
another area under increasing debate is whether 32 seeds are needed , with many believing that it distorts competition and can make for an over-predictable first week , although that was emphatically not the case at @entity4 twelve months ago			2
the number of seeds was doubled in 2001 but many feel that it is time to go back to the old system of a privileged draw for only 16 players , when getting seeded was a notable career boast in itself			0
@entity105 trains with @entity6 for the first time dream team ? @entity2 has recently appointed @entity6 ( right ) as his new coach			0

@entity33 is top seed , @entity40 second and @entity41 fourth
@entity2 last year became first @entity30 winner at @entity4 since 1936
@entity87 top women *'s* seed , with @entity115 second and @entity117 third
