a baffled couple have been ordered by the council to pull down their garage , driveway and wall - 30 years after planning permission was given			1
when @entity5 and @entity6 bought their home in @entity9 , @entity10 in 1986 one of the main attractions was the large extended double garage , which had been recently been built			1
but now @entity12 claims the extension – built with a previous council 's planning permission – is encroaching on a public footpath , even though there is a 4ft wide tarmac strip running past their house			1
@entity21 standing next to the garage and wall that the council are insisting is pulled down the problem became apparent when the retired couple , who are looking to rebuild their garage , noticed that the previous owners had n't registered the extension with @entity29 and decided to apply for ' possessory title ' or squatters ’ rights			1
their research revealed that planning permission had been given for a change of use for the land from an amenity area to a private garden in 1983 , and plans for a garage extension and driveway were granted the following year			1
the @entity42 even have a letter from the former @entity44 in 1985 , confirming that a boundary wall put up the following year conformed to official specifications			0
mrs @entity21 , a retired milliner , said : ' there 's never been an objection in 30 years and we ca n’t see what they will achieve apart from a bit of extra grass they will have to maintain			0
' i do n’t know why they want to make an issue of this other than that they can and they have the financial backing to do it			0
but it will cost us thousands of pounds – savings we hoped to put to better use in our retirement			2
' the @entity42 even have a letter from the former @entity44 in 1985 , confirming that a boundary wall put up the following year conformed to official specifications on @entity69 , the new unitary @entity10 was established			0
the @entity42 live in @entity9 in the @entity10 villager @entity70 , 85 , who has been a councillor for 40 years , said : ' in my mind this is total silliness , stupidity and lack of common sense on the part of the @entity10			2
' the original land the footpath was on is untouched and nothing is encroaching on the path that 's there now			0
' on april 1 , 1996 , @entity84 and the borough were abolished , and it became part of the new @entity10 council .			0
