by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:04 am on 29th june 2011 after the sweltering heat yesterday at @entity4 , violent thunderstorms disrupted play at @entity6 today as parts of @entity8 were battered by heavy rain			1
temperatures had soared to @entity11 yesterday , with trains cancelled and queueing chaos as massive crowds rushed to @entity15 to see @entity16 in action in the baking heat			1
but as southern parts of the country braced themselves for flash flooding following the hot spell , the women 's quarter finals were heavily disrupted as rain stopped play			1
riding out the storm : four diehard tennis fans sit on the steps at the bottom of @entity31 as rain disrupts @entity33 taking cover : the normally packed @entity31 had a lot more spare space today as rain kept many fans away queueing in the rain : fans determined to visit @entity6 braved the torrential downpours heavy downpours arrived shortly before the 1pm scheduled start of play , as tournament officials said there would be a delay of at least one hour			1
covers went on the courts and the @entity51 roof was moved into place so that play could continue			1
but the rain was so relentless at @entity4 that as it pounded down on the Â£ 80m @entity51 roof , the umpire had to shout to make himself heard during play			1
in @entity60 's quarter - final against @entity61 , a sudden burst of thunder made @entity60 jump as she walked towards the baseline			1
write caption here taking cover : staff on @entity51 take no chances and cover the surface before the roof is moved into place ' shame about the weather ' : @entity74 gestures across @entity51 as rain briefly disrupted play while the roof was moved into position newly crowned @entity79 winner @entity78 enjoys a sport on a different kind of green as he takes in the action from the @entity84 on @entity85 royal approval : princess @entity87 - minus any kind of headwear - watched the tennis with boyfriend @entity90 ministers have asked @entity92 to explain how train passengers were left ' stranded in very uncomfortable conditions ' in ultra-high temperatures			1
a series of incidents on mainline services led to delays and cancellations last night and again this morning as temperatures touched @entity102			1
@entity92 said a number of incidents had nothing to do with the hot weather and it was not correct to say that the infrastructure could not cope with a heatwave			1
among the passengers whose services were disrupted were those on @entity112 trains , where there were overhead wire problems			2
an @entity92 spokesman said : ' there has been an assumption that everything that has gone wrong was due to the heat			2
' but we had incidents that were nothing to do with the heat , such as broken - down trains and trespassing on the line			2
' he went on : ' it 's not right to say the infrastructure ca n't cope with the heat			2
' the match on @entity51 was the only one able to continue in the wet weather , but that did not stop hundreds of diehard fans watching the action from under umbrellas on @entity31			2
although there was guaranteed action on @entity51 , play on @entity139 was heavily delayed by the unrelenting rain			2
the @entity139 programme began with @entity145 eighth seed @entity143 's match against 32nd - seeded @entity147 @entity146 , with unseeded @entity149 @entity148 second on against @entity152 fourth seed @entity150			2
elsewhere , lightning struck electrical signalling on train lines in @entity156 which affected commuters leaving @entity158			1
lightning strikes meant delays of up to 90 minutes on services in the @entity162 and @entity164 areas of @entity165			1
passengers affected were on trains run by the @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity172 companies			2
passengers travelling on @entity175 trains to the airport were among those whose journeys were disrupted			2
another lightning strike was at signalling at @entity180 in @entity181			1
this led to 45 - minute delays to @entity185 ' services between @entity186 in @entity187 and @entity188			2
there were also disruptions to one of the @entity8 's busiest airports after lightning hit an air traffic control tower			1
the incident , at @entity196 in @entity197 at around 2pm , led to the temporary failure of some ground - based systems			1
planes continued to land but there were no departures for around half an hour			0
no one was hurt and there was no structural damage			0
parts of the country are bracing themselves for flash flooding today after forecasters predicted heavy rain and thunderstorms in the wake of the heatwave			0
the @entity215 and @entity216 have warned of localised flooding in @entity15 , the @entity218 and eastern @entity218 , saying up to 40mm of rain could fall in the space of a few hours			0
hail storms are also expected as the weather makes an abrupt u-turn following the hottest day of the year so far yesterday			1
brollies all round : the wet spell at @entity6 has followed several days of uninterrupted play following glorious sunshine rain stops play : @entity230 weather hammers down outside @entity51 following high pressure caused by yesterday 's heatwave still smiling : the constant rain did n't stop this couple from enjoying themselves with a drink running for cover : groundstaff are expertly trained in getting the @entity4 courts covered within seconds , while right , more rain - swept fans brave the wet weather the @entity215 has issued a flood alert for rivers in the @entity244 of @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 , with up to 30mm of rain predicted			1
surface water flooding could also occur in other regions hit by heavy storms			0
today : warm with heavy showers or thunderstorms possible in southeast @entity218 and @entity255			0
elsewhere , a much fresher - feeling day , though with showers developing in some central and northwestern parts through the afternoon			0
tonight : most places dry overnight , with showers becoming confined to the far southeast and northwest			0
turning locally rather cool under clear skies in central and western parts			0
wednesday : a fine day for much of the @entity8 , with sunny spells and a moderate westerly breeze			0
scattered showers are possible in many areas , most frequent in the north and west			0
thursday to saturday : generally dry with sunny spells on thursday			0
turning cloudier with occasional light rain in northern and western areas during friday and saturday , but staying fine elsewhere			0
an @entity215 spokesman said : ' @entity215 staff are on 24 - hour alert and teams are monitoring river levels as the band of rain moves across the country			0
' the public are encouraged to tune in to local media for weather forecasts for their area and to keep an eye out for signs of surface water flooding			0
' the threat of heavy rain comes after temperatures soared in a heatwave that saw the mercury reach @entity292 in @entity293 , @entity294 , in the hottest day of the year so far			1
a @entity216 spokesman said the ' sheer volume of rainfall falling in such a short space of time ' in some areas could lead to surface water flooding in some places			0
but the extremely dry spring , which has left some parts of east and central @entity218 officially in a state of drought , means that most rivers are at low levels and are unlikely to flood			0
according to @entity312 , showers and thunderstorms are expected in south east @entity218 and @entity255 during this morning			0
temperatures in @entity15 are not forecast to climb higher than @entity314 , while the west and the north will even see the weather turn chilly			1
@entity318 , a forecaster at @entity312 , said : ' there will be heavy showers and thunder storms developing in @entity218 and @entity255 during the morning			0
' there will be a risk of localised flash flooding but during the afternoon and evening the storms should clear eastwards			0
' temperatures in @entity15 and the @entity218 are forecast to drop to @entity326 later in the week and to @entity327 elsewhere in the @entity8			1
it was n't just the tennis : fans take cover as rain stopped play at the @entity334 during @entity336 's @entity335 against @entity337 @entity230 outlook : head groundsman @entity339 and reserve umpire @entity230 outlook : head groundsman @entity339 and reserve umpire @entity230 assess the conditions at the @entity334			0
