with its giant spires and magnificent dome to rival that of @entity5 , @entity1 's impressive cathedral looks like it has been skilfully crafted by a team of architectural experts			1
it 's impossible to believe that it has been single - handedly built by a former trappist monk who had never laid a brick in his life			1
the as yet unfinished building , a little over 12 miles outside of @entity14 , has been painstakingly built piece by piece over 50 years by 86 - year - old farmer @entity17			1
after working as a farmer and bullfighter , deeply religious mr @entity17 - or @entity20 as he is known - spent eight years at a @entity64 monastery			1
but he was forced to leave when he was struck down with tuburculosis in 1961			0
during his illness , he vowed that if he survived it he would build a chapel and name it after the @entity69 to whom he prayed while he was sick			2
true to his vow , @entity20 began building what he describes as his act of faith in 1963 and despite his lack of skills or building materials , is still working on the project today			0
vow : the former @entity64 monk began building the giant church after surviving tuberculosis in the early 1960s visitors welcome : the cathedral has never had planning permission but it is believed it is tolerated because it has become a tourist attraction over the years makeshift : the cathedral 's pillars are made from oil drums with @entity20 scouring the local area and other construction sites every day for waste materials dividing opinion : the cathedral 's giant towers dwarf surrounding apartments , with some locals said to consider the building to be an eyesore construction site : @entity20 estimated six years ago that it might take him another two decades to finish the work he has started despite the scepticism of many friends and locals , @entity20 has remarkably managed to build the place of worship without using so much as a crane			1
the vast columns of the structure are made from empty oil drums , while the covering on one of the domes is made from discarded food tubes			0
but , with @entity20 working on his own aside from occasional help from his six nephews , the cathedral is far from finished with windows left unpainted , one of the domes to be covered and the floor to be completed			0
the inspiration of @entity5 with its huge central dome is plain to see , but @entity20 's ideas were also taken from the @entity126 , and a variety of @entity40 castles and churches			0
no regrets : the former monk has said that if he had his life again he would start the cathedral over , but this time would build it twice as big unfinished : many of the staircases in the cathedral are left unfinished and the monk says that he might not live to see the cathedral completed room with a view : the grounds of the giant building are seen from one of the church 's spires - the tallest of which is around 131ft tall still going : @entity20 's cathedral is seen back in 1993 after 30 years of building work - it still remains unfinished 20 years on @entity20 told the @entity151 : ' when i look at what i 've created , it overwhelmes me and i give thanks to the lord			1
' if i lived my life again , i 'd build this cathedral again only bigger			2
' twice the size , because for me , this is an act of faith			0
' the church has never received planning permission , but it is believed that it is allowed to stay by local authorities because it has become something of a tourist attraction			0
homage : the monk has named the cathedral after the @entity69 whom @entity20 prayed to when he was ill with tuberculosis picturesque : the cathedral is pictured surrounded by trees that have grown around the impressive structure construction site : the cathedral looks a lot closer to being finished now than it did in pictures taken back in 1993			2

@entity17 has worked on the building at @entity1 near @entity14 since the early 1960s
he had no architectural training and no construction experience and had never laid a brick before in his life
the former @entity64 monk vowed to build the cathedral after surviving a bout of tuberculosis
