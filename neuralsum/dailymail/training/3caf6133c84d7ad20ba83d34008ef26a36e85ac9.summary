@entity0 made another gaffe on the campaign trail on wednesday by mistaking what century it was less than 24 hours after his ' put y'all back in chains ' race - baiting caused uproar			1
@entity0 seemed to mistake this century for the 1900s when he told a @entity10 crowd : ' folks , where 's it written we can not lead the world in the 20th century in making automobiles ? ' in a statement to the @entity19 , @entity17 campaign spokesman @entity16 was quick to take a jab at @entity0			1
@entity16 said : ' @entity17 and @entity21 will ensure @entity22 leads the world in the 21st century by strengthening middle - class families and creating jobs			0
a campaign based on rage and divisiveness ca n't hide the president 's failed record			0
' even as he 's faced with a chorus of @entity52 uproar , president @entity29 is standing by his man			1
the commander - in - chief fended off criticism of @entity0 after the vice president declared during a campaign stop on tuesday that @entity29 's opponent @entity17 wanted to ' put ya 'll back in chains			1
' hours after those comment hit the airwaves , @entity52 came out in force to suggest that it might be time for the president to put the 69 - year - old @entity0 out to pasture			2
among them was former @entity68 gov @entity67 , who went so far as to propose that @entity0 should be replaced with @entity69 if @entity29 wants to be re-elected			1
speaking on wednesday , @entity29 clarified @entity0 ’s remarks , telling @entity71 that he meant consumers would be worse off if the @entity52 succeeded in doing away with new restraints on financial institutions			1
" in no sense was he trying to connote something other than that , " @entity29 said			2
in @entity32 for a bus tour , @entity29 said the reaction to @entity0 's remarks was a function of politics , but he did not blame him			1
backlash : @entity67 called @entity0 's remark ' disgusting ' ' the truth is that during the course of these campaigns , folks like to get obsessed with how something was phrased even if everybody personally understands that 's not how it was meant , ' @entity29 told the magazine			1
he added : ' that 's sort of the nature of modern campaigns and modern coverage of campaigns			0
but i tell you , when i 'm traveling around @entity32 , that 's not what 's on people 's minds			2
' on tuesday in @entity104 , @entity10 , @entity0 told a crowd : ‘ ' he [ @entity17 ] said in the first 100 days he ’s going to let the big banks write their own rules , unchain @entity109			1
' before an audience that included hundreds of black people , @entity0 added : ' they 're going to put y’all back in chains			1
' @entity67 , who was @entity116 ’s running mate during his failed presidential bid in 2008 , called the quote ' disgusting			2
' shake up : @entity67 has said @entity29 should replace @entity0 with @entity69 as vice president swap : @entity67 suggested that @entity29 , pictured at a campaign stop on tuesday in @entity32 , replace @entity0 with his secretary of state , @entity69 , right she suggested that the @entity29 campaign would be much better off if it dumped @entity0 for @entity69			1
@entity67 told @entity125 host @entity124 on tuesday : ' the strategists there in the @entity29 campaign have got to look at a diplomatic way of replacing @entity0 on the ticket with @entity69 ... @entity0 really drags down that ticket			1
' she added that she hoped @entity29 would not take such a step because ‘ an @entity29 / @entity134 ticket would have a darn good chance of winning			2
' @entity67 was joined by another prominent @entity52 , former @entity137 mayor @entity136 , who questioned the vice president ’s ' mental capacity			2
' @entity136 told @entity141 : ' i 've never seen a vice president that has made as many mistakes , said as many stupid things			0
' questions : former @entity137 mayor @entity136 has called @entity0 ' not very bright ' in life of his recent gaffes ' i mean , there ’s a real fear if , @entity153 forbid , he ever had to be entrusted with the presidency , whether he really has the mental capacity to handle it			0
' i mean , this guy just is n’t bright			0
he ’s never been bright			0
and people think , “ well , he just talks a little too much			0
” actually he ’s just not very smart			0
' there is , however , very little chance that @entity29 would drop @entity0 as his running mate and it is doubtful that @entity134 would even want the job			1
even as @entity29 stuck up for his no. 2 , it did n’t stop @entity0 from making yet another gaffe on the campaign trail			1
he 's at it again : @entity0 made another gaffe on wednesday when he told a @entity10 crowd when he seemed to mistake this century for the 1900s january 2012 : during speech at a manufacturing plant in @entity173 the vice president spoke about outsourcing to @entity176 and put on a bad @entity178 accent while asking ' how many times do you get the call , ' i like to talk to you about your credit card			1
' december 2010 : during the swearing in of a @entity52 senator @entity52 in @entity185 , @entity0 told the @entity187 newcomer to put that hand on the @entity189 and raise his left			2
according to the congressional rulebook , it should have been the other way round.march 2010 : he dropped the f - bomb during the signing of the administration ’s historic health reforms , apparently unaware that the microphones would catch him out when he whispered into the president ’s ear immediately before the announcement , declaring : ' this is a big f * * * * * * deal ! ' march 2010 : mr @entity0 said ' @entity153 rest her soul ' in reference to the mother of @entity207 prime minister @entity206			2
mr @entity206 's mother is alive ; his father had died			0
realising his misstep , he corrected with : ' @entity153 bless her soul '			0
october 2008 : speaking in @entity212 , @entity213 about @entity116 's economic strategy , he said : ' look , @entity116 's last - minute economic plan does nothing to tackle the number - one job facing the middle class , and it happens to be , as @entity219 says , a three - letter word : jobs			0
' september 2008 : during a political rally in @entity226 , he urged wheelchair - bound state senator @entity227 to rise and be recognised , saying : ' @entity228 , @entity227 , let ' em see ya			0
' realizing his mistake , he said : ‘ oh , @entity153 love you … what am i talking about ? ’ september 2008 : after he was named the vice presidential nominee , he addressed a crowd in @entity232 , @entity173 , questioning how he beat out @entity69 : ' @entity69 is as qualified or more qualified than i am to be vice president of the @entity22 , ' he said in @entity173			1
' quite frankly it might have been a better pick than me			0
' august 2008 : he also mixed up @entity29 ’s name at his first campaign rally with the president , introducing him as : ' a man i 'm proud to call my friend			0
a man who will be the next @entity243 - @entity242 ! '			0

@entity0 makes another mistake in a speech to a @entity10 crowd , apparently mistaking this century for the 1900s
@entity29 comes to @entity0 's defence over ' put ya 'll back in chains ' remark in front of crowd that included hundreds of black people
faced criticism from *republicans* like @entity67 , who suggested that @entity0 be replaced with @entity69
