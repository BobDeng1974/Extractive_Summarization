the tool was introduced to football to help referees keep players sticking to the rules , but @entity5 found a way to make vanishing spray disappear on tuesday night			2
@entity9 striker @entity8 was lining up for a free - kick against @entity11 on the right - hand edge of the penalty area in the @entity15 clash , an angle not favourable for a shot at goal			1
the official had marked the spot for the kick to be taken from , but former @entity22 defender @entity5 , decided to scoop up the spray and move it to the side while @entity25 was not looking			0
@entity5 decides he does n't like the look of where the referee has marked out the free - kick the former @entity11 man rubbed out the foam with his hand while @entity8 waited behind him @entity5 then rubbed the foam from his hand into a different position the @entity33 then pointed to the new position for the free - kick and @entity8 promptly lined up his shot			1
perhaps @entity5 was trying to make up for his poor defending for the game 's opening goal			0
although playing in midfield , @entity5 moved back into his area to mark @entity41 but lost track of him just as his former team - mate rose highest to head past @entity44 in the @entity9 goal			2
@entity9 , though , equalised with a headed goal of their own after the break			0
@entity48 met @entity50 's cross to nod past @entity51			0
the @entity33 defender points to where he thinks @entity8 should now take the free - kick from the @entity56 striker sets up the ball in the new position while the original foam can still just be seen the @entity9 duo got away with their trick as the referee was busy establishing order in the box @entity11 midfielder @entity65 pulls on @entity5 's hair during the @entity15 clash			1

@entity5 lined up against his old club as @entity9 *hosted* @entity11
the referee *awarded* @entity5 a free - kick in the first half
the position of the foul was marked with vanishing spray
@entity5 scooped up the foam and moved it when the referee was n't looking
@entity9 drew 1 - 1 against @entity11 in the @entity15
