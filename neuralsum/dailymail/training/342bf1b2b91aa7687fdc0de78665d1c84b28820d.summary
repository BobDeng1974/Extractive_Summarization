' he was one of the most decorated airborne troops of the @entity12 who never knew when he was beaten			2

lt @entity38 said in an interview later : ' we were marched over to a bare patch where the bodies lay and a very hysterical civilian with two pistols assumed charge of a firing squad of 12 civilians armed with some ancient double and single barrel shotguns			1
' one ringleader incited the crowd to avenge the death of the two locals and show no mercy to the @entity47 troops			0
he reached the point of raising his arm to command the firing squad to take aim			0
