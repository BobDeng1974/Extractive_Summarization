lucky to be alive : @entity0 , with daughters @entity2 , lives to tell of her ordeal the weekend had been perfect : the sun had shone and the charming cottage they had rented in rural @entity9 had provided a much - needed break after months of gruelling @entity12 treatment			1
coming home , however , the roads were so choked with holiday traffic , @entity0 and her husband @entity13 had decided to take a scenic detour , making the journey to @entity20 much longer than expected			1
so when @entity0 , then 26 , walked through the front door she went straight to bed			1
but instead of drifting off to sleep , the music therapist suddenly found herself feeling breathless as a strange tingling sensation began shooting down her left arm			2
within a few moments , an excruciating pain gripped her left shoulder			2
‘ i kept gasping , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ @entity13 and i were terrified			2
i had no idea what was happening and @entity13 ran to call an ambulance			2
’ within hours , @entity0 , who does n’t smoke or drink , was in intensive care in @entity36 in @entity37 , having suffered a major heart attack caused by a blood clot			1
she says : ‘ i remember lying there , strapped to monitors , thinking “ how did i get here , what am i doing here ? ” ’ the doctors had no idea what had caused it — @entity0 had never suffered any cardiac problems before			1
it was only two days later , when she mentioned she was in the middle of @entity12 treatment , having already had three failed cycles , that the penny dropped			1
‘ they told me blood clots are a potential complication of @entity12 drugs , ’ she says			2
‘ sitting in the car for hours had caused a blood clot , which had moved to my heart			1
the @entity12 had been bad enough but now , all i could think was what chance did i have of conceiving after a heart attack ? i just could n’t stop crying			1
‘ i could n’t understand why no one had told me this could happen			2
if i ’d known , i would n’t have spent hours sitting in a car			2
’ the news got worse : the attack had caused a small hole in her heart , which had to be surgically repaired			1
doctors advised @entity0 to wait another nine months before having any more fertility treatment , to avoid putting her body under more strain			1
‘ it was a desperate time , ’ says @entity0 , from @entity78 , @entity20			1
‘ it seemed the very treatment that was supposed to help me achieve my dream was cruelly taking it away from me			1
’ @entity0 had needed @entity12 because she suffered from polycystic ovary syndrome , which made it difficult to get pregnant naturally			1
‘ i was never told that by having @entity12 i was putting my health at risk , ’ she says			2
‘ in fact , when nothing happened after the first two cycles , the doctors simply doubled the dosage of fertility drugs			0
’ @entity0 ’s story sits uneasily with the much - peddled notion that @entity12 is a safe way to have a baby			1
instead , stories like hers raise the terrifying question of whether some ivf clinics are cynically capitalising on women ’s desire for a baby , without paying due care to their health			1
around 45,000 ivf cycles are performed in the @entity126 every year to help the one in six couples who suffer from infertility			1
it ’s free on the @entity130 in some areas , but private clinics charge around £ 5,000 for a single treatment			1
the process usually involves injecting stimulating drugs for two weeks so that the woman ’s ovaries produce as many eggs as possible — usually 20 to 30			1
these are then fertilised before being implanted into the womb			0
it ’s thought that the more eggs that can be harvested in a single procedure , the better : any spare embryos can be frozen for use at a later date			0
" blood specialists warned us there was a risk but nobody told us that @entity12 could be life - threatening " @entity152 yet it seems not all women are warned of the serious risks — including death — that can result			0
last year , a @entity158 study found women who get pregnant through @entity12 are almost twice as likely to develop potentially fatal blood clots because of the drugs used			1
deep vein thrombosis happens to four women per 1,000 who get pregnant through @entity12			2
the risks are very real			0
in 2012 , @entity166 , 26 , from @entity167 in @entity168 , died from a massive stroke , triggered by a clot , just weeks after getting pregnant through @entity12			1
she was already receiving treatment for a condition called anti-phospholipid syndrome , which makes the blood prone to clotting , but her family say she was n’t aware her @entity12 could prove fatal as it can also increase the risk			2
her husband @entity178 said : ‘ blood specialists warned us there was a risk of clotting from changing @entity166 ’s medication , but nobody told us that @entity12 could be life - threatening			1
’ regardless of how they conceive , all women are more prone to clots in pregnancy as the blood tends to coagulate more easily			0
however , @entity12 carries an extra risk because it can result in ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome ( @entity192 ) which again raises the chance of a clot			1
@entity192 is caused by the body over-reacting to the drugs used to stimulate the production of eggs			0
it ’s surprisingly common , affecting women after around one in ten cycles of @entity12 drugs			0
tragic : @entity166 , pictured with husband @entity178 , died of a stroke just after getting pregnant through ivf ‘ the problem with over-stimulating the ovaries is that this , in turn , produces larger amounts of the hormone oestrogen , ’ explains @entity203 , consultant gynaecologist and medical director of @entity205 in @entity206 , @entity207			1
‘ increased amounts of oestrogen can make the blood thicken and could cause it to clot			2
‘ certain women are particularly vulnerable to @entity192 such as those who suffer with polycystic ovary syndrome , and those under 35			0
’ and @entity192 can also lead to other complications			0
@entity222 , who needed @entity12 because of her husband @entity223 ’s low sperm count , was 15 weeks pregnant when she began suffering agonising pains in her left side			1
‘ i felt like a knife twisting inside me , ’ says the 27 - year - old , from @entity228			0
‘ all i could think was “ please save my baby and make this stop ”			0
i felt i ’d done the hard part by getting pregnant			2
we were absolutely desperate to have a family — i could n’t lose my baby now			0
’ agonising : @entity222 , 27 , suffered painful ovarian torsion after undergoing rounds of @entity12 treatment she was rushed into hospital one sunday and diagnosed with ovarian torsion , where heavy doses of @entity12 drugs cause cysts to develop on an ovary and twist it out of position			1
surgeons immediately removed @entity222 ’s left ovary and fallopian tube but she had to wait an agonising 24 hours before discovering if the baby had survived as the scan clinic was closed for the weekend			2
‘ i was utterly overwhelmed when i discovered the baby was ok , ’ she says , ‘ but the rest of the pregnancy was awful			0
i could hardly stand up for about five weeks because of the surgery			1
’ thankfully , baby @entity256 was born healthy after a three - hour labour			0
‘ i felt absolutely overwhelmed with love for him			0
i ’ve never felt such happiness , ’ says @entity222			0
‘ i could n’t stop looking at him in wonder and thinking “ it ’s over , i ’m finally a mum ” , ’ she says			0
‘ all that hurt and frustration and misery just melted away and all my husband could say was “ my son , my son ”			0
’ but consultant gynaecologist professor @entity269 believes many women are suffering unnecessarily and do n’t need to be given huge amounts of drugs			0
relief : @entity222 could n't believe it when she gave birth to @entity256 though she had to have her left ovary removed she practises ‘ natural ’ ivf at the @entity277 , and does n’t try to boost egg production with drugs , instead harvesting the eggs that a woman produces naturally			2
if that does n’t work , they use a low - dose stimulant for just a few days to produce between two and seven eggs , not the usual 20 to 30			0
she says : ‘ by not stimulating the ovaries , we get the strongest eggs , the ones chosen by the body as most suitable for fertilisation			0
‘ by looking at the quality of a woman ’s eggs , not the quantity , we can give her the greatest chance of success while minimising the risks			0
’ following her horrific experience with @entity12 , @entity0 eventually gave birth to a healthy baby , @entity3 , who ’s now seven , after undergoing ‘ natural ’ treatment , along with low doses of fertility drugs			1
‘ even now i struggle to find the words to describe that moment , ’ she says			0
‘ i never , ever imagined that i ’d hold my own baby in my arms			0
and then she was here			0
’ incredibly , 16 months later , @entity0 discovered she was pregnant again , this time thanks to @entity308			1
it seems her ovaries were naturally stimulated by @entity3 ’s arrival and started working normally			0
her second daughter , @entity2 , is now five			0
but despite this , @entity0 remains angered by how little information is given to some women about the possible health risks of @entity12			1
‘ when you have @entity12 , it ’s all - consuming , you ca n’t think about anything else , ’ she says			0
‘ the sheer volume of drugs you take is massive — i had horrible mood swings and i remember once dropping a vial of one of the drugs on the floor by accident and going crazy			2
‘ the stress on my relationship was massive			2
and then i had a heart attack , which nearly killed me			1
‘ yet @entity3 is the proof that women do n’t need to be pumped with heavy doses of these drugs and doctors should n’t take such a cavalier attitude as they seem to do now			0
‘ they have to rethink their methods			0
no woman should be allowed to die just because she ’s desperate for a baby			0

after intense treatment @entity0 *'s* *relaxing* break turned into a *nightmare*
@entity0 suffered a heart attack and had to undergo surgery , lessening her chances of conceiving
the young couple had to wait another nine months before having more ivf
other possible side effects include ovarian torsion
in 2012 @entity166 , 26 , died from a massive stroke , triggered by a clot , just weeks after getting pregnant through ivf
