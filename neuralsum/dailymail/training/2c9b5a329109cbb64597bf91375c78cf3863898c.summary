the @entity0 in later life has been launched at a @entity3 summit - and its mission is to avert what the think - tank @entity5 has called ' the next big housing crisis '			1
fronted by @entity10 and backed by housing providers as well as the charity shelter , it aims to convince councils to recognise the changing needs of older people			1
@entity5 says there is a ' chronic undersupply of appropriate housing for older people ' , and more and more are living in homes that are unmanageable			1
there is a ' chronic undersupply of appropriate housing for older people ' this has a negative impact not just on their health and wellbeing but on the rest of the housing chain , because properties are not being freed up for families desperate to get on the ladder			1
one man who has managed to make the switch from large family home to retirement accommodation is @entity37 widower @entity36 - thanks to his daughter @entity38			2
returning from @entity40 to live with her father , she saw him struggling with the house and garden and suggested he downsize			0
' i did n't want to change my gp , and found a development in @entity47 that allowed me to stay with the practice , ' says @entity36 , 75			0
the former insurance broker sold his house in @entity51 and bought a one - bedroom apartment at nearby @entity53 , run by @entity54 , for Â£ 275,000 on a long lease			2
he spends half the year at a holiday apartment in @entity57 , so the fact that the property would be looked after while he was away appealed to him			0
another plus was that the town centre is just a few minutes ' walk away			0
@entity53 comprises 46 private one - and two - bedroom apartments designed for retired owners			2
there is a lounge for coffee mornings , games afternoons and cream teas , and a manager is on hand to deal with any problems			0
another boon for @entity36 - the brother of late anti-smoking ' guru ' @entity76 - is that the development has guest rooms where visiting family can stay			0
a @entity5 report last month estimated that if all those interested in buying retirement property were able to do so , 3.29 million properties would be freed up .			1
