what would you get if one of the @entity4 's corgis ran off with one of sir @entity8 's @entity7 huskies and had a puppy ? a corgski , of course , just like @entity12 at just 18.5in from foot to shoulder , this diminutive fellow looks as if he was the runt of his litter			2
he is , in fact , a fully grown husky - corgi cross			1
but , unbelievably , @entity20 has been abandoned and he 's looking for a home			2
he 's become a favourite with workers at the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , who have been looking after him since he was found			1
@entity20 ( pictured ) is a 18.5in high fully - grown husky corgi cross			1
after being abandoned , he has now taken refuge at the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 huskies , such as the one pictured , have become increasingly popular due to shows such as @entity34 pictured is a typical @entity37 corgi			1
@entity20 is part corgi , part husky , and is looking for a new home ' it quickly became apparent that he was the epitome of the saying good things come in small packages , ' says the @entity24 's @entity46			2
' he caught the eye of our staff when he arrived , but as he was found as a stray , little is known about his life before			0
' @entity20 is described as gentle , intelligent and big - hearted			0
there are currently 54 other wolf - like breeds being cared for by the charity 's network of animal rehousing centres			0
the @entity24 is in no doubt that the trend is partly due to fans wanting to follow the stars of @entity34 and @entity62 , which have popularised wolf - like dogs such as @entity64 and @entity7 huskies			0
but many new owners are often unprepared to cope with the specific exercise and socialisation requirements of these breeds – and make a lifetime commitment to them – resulting in a significant number eventually being abandoned .			0
