by @entity0 a @entity2 high school student has unwittingly started a revolution by refusing to change out of a pair of shorts that high school authorities deemed too short			1
@entity7 , a grade 11 student at @entity8 , donned a pair of denim shorts on may 21 , one of the first hot days of the season but was ordered to change by her school 's vice principals			1
she refused , and instead printed a poster that she plastered over the school , questioning why girls ' bodies were the focus of the rules instead of boys ' behavior			1
get shorty : @entity7 says she was humiliated in front of her class for wearing a pair of shorts on a hot day during third period on that day , two vice principals entered her classroom and told everyone to stand up so their outfits could be inspected			1
' and when they came to me after about two rows of looking they stopped and told me my shorts were too short and i had to change , ' @entity7 told the @entity35			1
' they continued to tell me would be suspended if i did n't start following the rules			0
when i told them i did n't understand why i had to change they told me that it does n't matter - i do n't have to understand the rules , i just have to comply by them			0
' @entity7 felt singled out and humiliated in front of her class , but what concerned her more was a set of rules that focused on girls ' bodies rather than boys ' behavior			1
so instead of complying with the rules , she went and printed up about 20 posters and stuck them up all over the school			0
the posters read , ' do n't humiliate her because she 's wearing shorts			1
instead of shaming girls for their bodies , teach boys that girls are not sexual objects			1
' statement : although @entity7 's poster only remained up for about 10 minutes before teachers took it down , it had the desired effect support : @entity7 has had strong support on social media and other girls at her high school are wearing shorts to school in solidarity the posters were taken down by teachers after about 10 minutes , but they live on in social media			1
@entity7 also has won the support and admiration of other girls at school			0
' most people are agreeing with her , women should n’t have to cover themselves up completely because we should n’t be viewed as sexual objects , ' student @entity85 told @entity90			2
@entity91 , 15 , showed up wearing shorts in support of @entity7			2
she said the dress code verification - making girls stand up with their arms by their sides to ensure their outfits are fingertip length - is ' humiliating			0
' school rules : the school district spokesperson says there are dress rules for both girls and boys ' people are being judged for the way they dress , they have to change because boys look at them			2
the boys should be the ones who have to learn to treat women better and look at them in a different light , ' she told @entity116			0
the chairperson of the @entity118 told @entity90 that @entity7 has been suspended for not following the rules			0
' the rules are there to help the children learn and prepare them for their future work places , high school is a job for them , they are there to learn to function in society , so it ’s important that the rules be followed , ' @entity120 says			2
' girls and boys have rules on dress codes ; it is not a girl , boy thing , that ’s not the point			0
' i was in violation for showing my legs , ' she says			0
' and that , point blank , is a problem for me			0
