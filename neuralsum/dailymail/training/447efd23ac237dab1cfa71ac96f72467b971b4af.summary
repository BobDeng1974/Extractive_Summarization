every schoolboy knows the story of how the dinosaurs were wiped out by a giant asteroid 65million years ago			1
but an intriguing theory has arisen suggesting that the dinosaurs may have an asteroid to thank for their existence - with an asteroid possibly sweeping away all contenders 201million years ago , allowing the terrible lizards to rise to the top of the food chain			1
paleontologist @entity13 and geologist @entity14 of @entity15 have been exploring this theory and looking for evidence that an asteroid did strike the @entity18 , causing the @entity21 - @entity20 extinction			1
round 2 : an artist 's impression of how the six - mile wide asteroid might have looked as it ploughed into our world , decimating life on the surface over the past 450 million years , life on earth has undergone at least five great extinctions , when biological activity nosedived and dominant groups of creatures disappeared			1
the final one - so far - was 65 million years ago , when it appears that a giant meteorite brought fires , shock waves and tsunamis , then drastically altered the climate , which killed off the dinosaurs and set the stage for mammals - and eventually us - to evolve			1
a team from @entity15 explore the coasts of @entity48 to see if the sediment holds clues to the past many scientists are now starting to think we are on the edge of a sixth extinction - his one driven by human destruction of other species and their habitats , and our quickening releases of carbon dioxide into the air , which threatens to bring another round of rapid climate change			1
the causes of the fourth extinction - the one that paved the way for the dinosaurs - are a mystery			1
@entity70 and @entity71 have been gathering clues from sites including ancient lava flows in @entity75 , wave - washed sea cliffs along the coast of @entity78 , and in rocks deep beneath the modern landscapes of @entity81 and @entity82			2
the @entity21 - @entity20 extinction wiped out half the species on earth : eel - like fish called conodonts ; mammal - like swamp - dwelling therapsids ; early crocodilians ; monkey - faced tree - dwelling lizards ; many broad - leaved plants ; and others			1
dinosaurs were until then a relatively minor group , but hung on and subsequently evolved rapidly in size and diversity			2
until recently , the exact timing remained murky , but by 2002 evidence from fossils and other sources showed it was extremely sudden - spanning just a few thousand years or maybe less , at 201.4 million years ago			1
as for the causes , among other things , scientists have contemplated gradual shifts in climate and sea levels that reached a deadly tipping point			2
however , bets today have shifted to massive volcanic eruptions that alternately cooled and heated the atmosphere with soot and carbon dioxide – much like human pollutants today			1
mass extinction : a mega asteroid is the most likely cause of the major extinction event 65million years ago - and perhaps the previous one recently , @entity70 and @entity71 have introduced another possibility : a meteorite like the one that killed the dinosaurs			1
but evidence for all the ideas remains incomplete			2
' the only thing we can say for certain about the @entity21 - @entity20 extinction is that it happened , ' said @entity70			1
' it could have happened over 10,000 years , or it could have happened in a day			1
' in 2002 , @entity70 and @entity71 coauthored a paper in the journal @entity130 showing that large dinosaurs showed up in what is now @entity81 just 10,000 years after the @entity21 extinction			1
moreover , they showed that rocks from that time contain a spike of iridium – an element rare in earth ’s crust , but abundant in meteorites			2
soon , other researchers found seemingly related evidence near the @entity21 - @entity20 boundary , including roughly matching iridium layers in @entity75 and @entity147 , and quartz in @entity149 apparently shattered by some gigantic impact			0
but the case was inconclusive ; for one thing , there was no known meteorite crater from that time big enough to have spread such an iridium layer , nor caused global damage			1
meanwhile , @entity71 , @entity70 and others began to build the case for volcanism			0
roughly concurrent with the extinction , the single giant continent of @entity162 , then comprising most of earth ’s landmass , began splitting up			1
one rift evolved into the @entity166 , as new continents moved apart ; this was accompanied by repeated massive outpourings of lava over hundreds of thousands of years , forming the @entity166 magmatic province - igneous rocks that underlie today ’s coasts of eastern @entity173 and parts of @entity175 and @entity176			1
@entity178 particles from eruptions would have darkened skies for years , chilling the planet			2
such particles settle quickly , but another major component of volcanic eruptions is carbon dioxide , which stays in the air for centuries , warming it up			0
thus , alternate chills and heat waves would have prevailed			0
@entity71 and @entity70 have gathered perhaps the clearest evidence of such a scenario so far			0
last year , in another science paper , they showed that lava flooded what is now the @entity196 northeast several times in spurts separated by about 200,000 years each			2
using deep drill cores penetrating below today ’s heavily settled landscape , they have analyzed those lava sheets , along with intervening layers of ancient soils built up during pauses in the volcanism			0
the soils , they found , contain spikes of carbon dioxide five to ten times the levels of today - enough to kill off much plant and animal life with excess heat , and acidify the oceans with chemical reactions			0
' the flipping back and forth between extremes of hot and cold , quite possibly would be worse than either one alone , ' said @entity70			0
the earliest lavas in the @entity196 northeast seem to come about 10,000 years after the sharp extinction boundary , so it is hard to show a connection there ; but lavas in the @entity224 of @entity75 that @entity70 has sampled seem to coincide directly with it			1
round 1 : an underwater volcano erupts near @entity228 in 2009 - perhaps a reminder of an extinction more than 65million years ago this year , the scientists drilled more cores in @entity81 in an attempt to refine their data			1
in 2010 , the meteorite idea popped up again , when a separate research group re-dated a badly eroded meteorite crater near @entity238 , western @entity239 , previously thought to be 214 million years old			1
instead , they found it is 201.4 million years old - exactly matching the @entity243 boundary			2
the crater is only a sixth the size of @entity247 ’s @entity246 , which is correlated with the dinosaurs ’ demise , and probably not big enough to cause global catastrophe - but enough to intrigue @entity70 and @entity71			0
they have been drawn also by accounts of recently identified sedimentary rocks along sea cliffs in @entity255 , @entity78 and @entity256 from the same time			0
one layer seems to have been formed or altered by some giant tsunami or earthquake - a possible product of the impact			0
' we still favor volcanism , but a role for a meteorite in softening up ecosystems for the onslaught that followed is not impossible , ' said @entity70			0
' at this point , we have a big hole ; evidence of shaking ; an iridium layer ; and a disappearance ,			0
all around the same time			0
but we do n’t know if it was at exactly the same time			0
' as @entity14 recently told nature reporter @entity274 : ' the only way we are ever going to be able to unravel this mystery is to work out a timeline , as precise as we can make it , of all the various events around the world that led up to it			0
' in 2011 , @entity71 and @entity70 headed to the @entity48 to investigate how the rocks there relate to the extinction - specifically , whether they contain an iridium spike indicating a meteorite @entity286 has also visited the @entity224 of @entity75 , where giant sheets of volcanic basalt and other rocks dating to this time lie exposed			2
in 2012 , they also returned to a site that is a staple for college geology - class field trips : a rock layer in @entity295 , @entity82 , that is one of the few places where the sharp but often deeply buried @entity21 - @entity20 boundary is clearly visible to the naked eye and easily accessible			0
the layer sits exposed in a bluff near a housing development			0
they hope to drill this site as well			0
whatever the exact mechanisms of the extinction , the researchers see parallels with today			2
rapid changes to the atmosphere , including massive carbon dioxide releases , obviously took a toll – possibly on time scales similar to our own current boom in carbon - dioxide production and the resulting warming of the world			2
' there probably are very significant lessons to be learned about processes in the doubling of @entity322 , ' said @entity70			0
' we have to get , however , the pattern , and the basic chronology and the basic history right first , before we try to learn great lessons about what lies ahead for us in the future			0

mass extinction event 201million years ago may have been caused by a massive asteroid which landed in @entity239
