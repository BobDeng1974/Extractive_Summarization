nabbed : @entity11 , 23 , and @entity21 , 24 , were arrested december 8 after police say they forged bank documents in order to squat illegally in a foreclosed $ 1million @entity13 , @entity2 home bad timing : the home had been foreclosed sine 2011 , and the @entity18 may have gotten away with the fraud for longer , police say , but they happened to move in less than a month before an @entity31 couple finally decided to buy the home legitimately @entity34 police say the couple removed the home 's existing locks and replaced them with their own when they moved in , @entity39 reports			1
authorities say the young couple , who 'd recently had a baby , then began to boast about their property on @entity44 , where they posted photos of themselves in the pool			1

' the only furniture in the house was a pool table			1
' investigators say @entity11 wrote on her @entity44 : ' this is the house we just bought			2
we have a lot of work to do , it 'll take some time but @entity63 was n't built overnight			0
' when a friend of the couple 's admired their palatial new pad on @entity44 and asked how they snagged such a find , @entity21 said it just takes time ... and skill			2

when the bank that owned the home told authorities the @entity18 did not own it , investigators showed up			2
the @entity18 graciously gave them a tour and showed them a cell phone photo of a quit claim deed -- a document used to transfer property from one party to another quickly but with little legal security			2
not a care in the world : police say the couple even snapped themselves enjoying the pool and posted the photo to @entity44 not the sharpest : police say the fraud was discovered after the home was purchased along with the 200 acres on which it sits			1

a @entity44 account for the business gave a suspicious and hurried farewell to customers on december 1 , just a week before the @entity18 turned themselves in while the home had languished in foreclosure since 2011 unpurchased , the @entity18 chose the wrong time to pretend they bought it			1
less than a month after their allegedly faked documents say the @entity18 bought the house , an @entity31 couple bought it for real			1
