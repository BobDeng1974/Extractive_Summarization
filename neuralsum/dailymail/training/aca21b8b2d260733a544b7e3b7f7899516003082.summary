two years ago lingerie shops were staffed by men which could prove awkward when women had to discuss underwear sizing with the men			2

' with @entity4 female athletes now joining their fellow female competitors from @entity142 and @entity143 , it means that by @entity6 every @entity144 will have sent women to the @entity23			1
' @entity142 and @entity143 , two other countries that have never sent any female athletes to the @entity6 , are also including women on their teams for the @entity3			1

the @entity128 has been in negotiations with the @entity4 for months on securing the participation of women			2
they said the two @entity4 athletes were entered by the @entity131 by the official deadline of july 9			0
adherence : in @entity4 when in public women are required to wear a black abaya and head scarf by law rights groups hailed the decision as a step forward for @entity4 women in their quest for basic rights in a country that severely restricts them in public life			2
' it 's an important precedent that will create space for women to get rights and it will be hard for @entity4 hardliners to roll back , ' said @entity188 of the @entity190 - based @entity189			2
good news : @entity128 president @entity127 described their entry as ' very positive news ' in the @entity4 city of @entity196 , @entity197 , a housewife in her 20s , said : ' this is fantastic news and it 's about time			2

the world already knows that women can do great things - maybe now @entity4 can know that too			2
' @entity207 , a 28 - year - old @entity4 man who works at an investment firm in @entity196 , said the athletes were likely to face " heavy criticism " in the country , but that the government should support @entity213 has a reputation as a cautious reformer and supporter of women 's rights			2
last year he announced plans to allow women to vote in municipal council elections and join the consultative @entity222 council			0
the country 's official sports body , the @entity225 , only caters to male athletes and women do not take part in sports at state schools			0
so women athletes have to fund themselves and arrange their own training , mostly abroad			0
a @entity4 official told @entity234 earlier this week @entity4 women participating in the @entity6 would have to obey the dress code of @entity9 law			2
he did not elaborate , but other conservative @entity9 countries have interpreted this to mean a headscarf , long sleeves and long pants			0
@entity4 is one of three countries , alongside @entity143 and @entity142 , never to have sent female athletes to the @entity6 but the latter two confirmed earlier this year that their delegations would include women			1
