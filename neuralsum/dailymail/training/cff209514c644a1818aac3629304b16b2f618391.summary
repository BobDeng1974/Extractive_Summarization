defense secretary @entity0 admitted on friday that three @entity2 nuclear missile bases in @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 were so badly managed that they had to share a wrench used to tighten warheads to the business end of @entity10 missiles			1
' how did they do it ? they did it by federal expressing the one wrench around to each base , ' @entity15 told reporters friday morning during a press conference called to introduce new system - wide reforms affecting the nation 's entire intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal			1
' they were creative and innovative and they made it work			0
but that is not the way to do it			0
we now have a wrench for each location			0
we 're going to have two for each location soon			0
' the three facilities in question house about 450 nuclear missiles			1
the reviews found a ' disconnect ' between what nuclear force leaders say and what they deliver to lower - level troops who execute the missions in the field			1
deputy defense secretary @entity65 added that the shared hardware was ' a little toolkit to thread the bolt so that the wrenches could attach [ to a warhead ] , and they were being fedexed around as the secretary said			1
' ' for me , a @entity74 , that 's a metaphor ... for how far things had fallen			1
' the near - comical situation arose , @entity65 said , ' because people stopped reporting it			1
they had reported it over and over and they just worked around it			0
' @entity15 said a lack of sustained attention and investment in the force had caused @entity2 's nuclear warfare system to ' slowly back downhill			1
' but ' the good news , he said , ' is there 's nothing here that we ca n't fix			0
the good news is that none of this has endangered @entity2 , @entity2 , or put our security at risk			2
' he added that the @entity50 will boost spending on the nuclear forces by about 10 percent a year for the next five years – an increase of nearly $ 10 billion – adding there is no problem on this issue the @entity50 ca n't fix			1
' the internal and external reviews i ordered show that a consistent lack of investment and support for our nuclear forces over far too many years has left us with too little margin to cope with mounting stresses , ' said @entity15 , who was flanked by senior @entity116 and @entity117 officers			0
' the root cause has been a lack of sustained focus , attention , and resources , resulting in a pervasive sense that a career in the nuclear enterprise offers too few opportunities for growth and advancement			0
' online reaction to @entity15 's revelation was the digital equivalent of a nation shaking its collective head sadly , it was n't a garden - variety wrench that the @entity116 could have found at a @entity136 or a bike shop @entity15 is ordering top - to - bottom changes in how the nation 's nuclear arsenal is managed , vowing to invest billions of dollars more to fix what ails a force beset by leadership lapses , security flaws and sagging morale @entity15 ordered two reviews in february – one by @entity50 officials and a second by outside experts – as a result of a series of @entity153 stories that revealed lapses in leadership , morale , safety and security at the nation 's three nuclear @entity116 bases			1
the good news , @entity15 said , ' is there has been no nuclear exchange in the world			0
' acknowledging the years of neglect , which included glaring problems that prompted then - defense secretary @entity166 to fire his top military and civilian @entity116 leaders in 2008 , @entity15 vowed renewed accountability			1
' previous reviews of our nuclear enterprise lacked clear follow - up mechanisms , ' he said			2
' recommendations were implemented without the necessary follow - through to assess that they were implemented effectively			0
' @entity15 added that this time , people will be held accountable to ensure the improvements are done			0
navy adm. @entity179 , the head of @entity180 , said the nuclear force has been operating securely			2
' you do n't see the mushroom cloud or that sort of thing			0
we must continue that , ' he told reporters			0
@entity15 's moves , while not dramatic , are designed to get at the core of the problem			0
among his more significant moves , he authorized the @entity116 to put a four - star general in charge of its nuclear forces , according to officials			2
the top @entity116 nuclear commander currently is a three - star			1
lt. gen. @entity199 is responsible not only for the 450 @entity200 but also the nuclear bomber force			1
@entity15 has concluded that a four - star would be able to exert more influence within the @entity116 and send a signal to the entire force that the mission is taken seriously , the defense officials said			1
@entity15 also ok 'd a proposal to upgrade the top nuclear force official at @entity116 headquarters in the @entity50 from a two - star general to a three - star			1
the review 's authors , retired @entity116 gen. @entity215 and retired @entity117 adm. @entity216 , found fault with one of the unique features of life in the nuclear forces			1
it is called the @entity223 , designed to monitor the mental fitness of people to be entrusted with the world 's deadliest weapons			0
over time , that program has devolved into a burdensome administrative exercise that detracts from the mission , the authors found			0
@entity15 concluded that despite tight @entity50 budgets , billions of dollars more will be needed over the next five years to upgrade equipment			1
that will include a proposal to replace the @entity239 - era @entity238 helicopter fleet that is part of the security forces at icbm bases			0
the @entity116 declared them out of date years ago but put available resources into other priorities			0
the @entity117 , which operates nuclear - armed submarines , has had its own problems , including an exam - cheating scandal this year among nuclear reactor training instructors and has suffered from a shortage of personnel			2
@entity253 : missile maintenance crews often have to descend into silos to perform upkeep or repairs – which are n't possible without the right tools @entity2 's nuclear weapons system still relies heavily on the @entity261 missile when he ordered the reviews , shortly after the @entity116 announced it was investigating an exam - cheating ring at one @entity266 base and a related drug investigation implicating missile crew members , @entity15 was said to be flabbergasted that such misbehavior could be infecting the force			1
' he said , ' what is going on here ? '' said one senior defense official , who spoke about the review on condition of anonymity			2
@entity276 , a nuclear expert with the @entity278 , said thursday that while he had not seen the @entity15 reviews or heard what actions @entity15 was ordering , he was skeptical that it would make much difference			0
' throwing money after problems may fix some technical issues but it is unlikely to resolve the dissolution that must come from sitting in a silo hole in the @entity289 with missiles on high alert to respond to a nuclear attack that is unlikely to ever come , ' @entity276 said			2
a cascade of embarrassments befell the @entity116 over the past two years , beginning with an @entity153 story in may 2013 revealing one missile officer 's lament of ' rot ' inside the force			2
another @entity153 story in november disclosed that an independent assessment for the @entity116 found signs of ' burnout ' and elevated levels of personal misconduct among missile launch crews and missile security forces			2
the @entity153 also disclosed last year that four @entity266 launch officers were disciplined for violating security rules by opening the blast door to their underground command post while one crew member was asleep			0
just last week the @entity153 disclosed that the @entity116 fired two nuclear commanders and disciplined a third , providing evidence that leadership lapses are continuing even as top @entity116 officials attempt to bring stability to the icbm force			2
after his @entity50 announcement @entity15 was expected to fly to @entity322 in @entity3 , home of a @entity10 missile unit whose recent setbacks are emblematic of the trouble dogging the broader nuclear force .			1

toolkit needed to connect warheads to @entity261 missiles were in short supply so three mechanic crews fedexed one kit back and forth
the single wrench was the only hardware available to service 450 missiles
' for me , a @entity74 , that 's a metaphor , ' said deputy defense secretary @entity65
@entity50 chief @entity0 described the foul - up in the context of a top - to - bottom review of @entity2 's nuclear arsenal
@entity50 panel is recommending changes to *counteract* ' burnout ' and aging *technology* in the @entity2 missile force
