@entity122 mp dr @entity121 condemned the ‘ free advertising ’ being given to big name brands			1

’ fizzy drinks are one of the biggest causes of obesity in children , she added			1
‘ if you can not persuade some parents to stop giving them to children , you could get them to make a less harmful choice			0
‘ i share the concern that sending people vouchers starts to look a bit more like advertising			2
there are other mechanisms that much more powerful			0
’ the @entity45 suggests making drinks using fresh fruits and fizzy water , instead of buying branded pop dr @entity121 , a former gp and member of the health select committees , suggested discounts and offers should be offered on low - sugar and low - salt products in store to encourage shoppers to switch			1
‘ @entity19 ’s and @entity18 are getting a bit of free advertising			1
it is a form of product endorsement			0
‘ do i think it ’s the best way of reducing harm ? no. it is a good way of ticking a box and getting endorsement from @entity167 ’s government			0
is that really going to address the nation ’s obesity crisis ? ’ @entity171 , spokesman for the @entity172 , said : ‘ i regard it as being straightforward advertising which has been foisted on the @entity175 by an industry which wishes to put itself in a good light and has convinced @entity178 it is a brilliant idea			1
‘ it ’s just another way in which the punter is being persuaded to go off and buy this , that and the other and the only winners are the stores that you buy them in			0
’ @entity122 mp dr @entity121 said the campaign was giving government endorsement to global food brands @entity31 insists that there are no obesity or dietary related health risks to drinking diet versions of carbonated drinks			1

professor @entity204 , national director of health and wellbeing , said : ' no company paid to be included within the packs			0
all organisations that signed up to be @entity31 partners for the campaign were able to support in ways appropriate to the campaigns objectives			2
' all partners were asked to supply money off next purchase vouchers to help incentivise families to make healthier swaps and reduce the amount of fat , sugar and calories in their diets			2
' @entity31 will consider the results of the campaign and review whether no added sugar carbonated soft drinks is permanently included into the retail guidance			1
prof @entity204 added : ' @entity30 is about encouraging families to make some easy like - for - like swaps to their diet in january and beyond to remove calories , fat and sugar			0
‘ clearly the " ideal " swap would be from sugary drinks to water , hence the fridge magnet fun reminder ‘ you oughta swap to water ’ , but there are still significant benefits to be had in encouraging a nationwide shift from sugary to sugar - free / diet variants			0
' research shows there are no obesity / dietary related health risks to drinking diet versions of carbonated drinks			0
