a @entity1 student whose reputation was trashed by @entity4 's discredited tale of a violent gang rape on campus has taken the magazine to task for not firing anybody after its story fell apart			1
@entity12 , a former friend of supposed victim ' @entity12 ' , spoke out after he featured in the now - infamous feature a rape on @entity15 , and was painted as a callous social climber who discouraged a rape victim from speaking out			1
' i think the @entity4 absolutely should be held accountable ' , he said in a tv interview monday , and added the under - fire magazine has risked its reputation by not disciplining @entity23 , the reporter who wrote the story			1
the most important failing , they said , was not contacting @entity12 and another student , @entity38 , who spoke out alongside @entity12 in an interview with @entity41 's @entity40			1
@entity12 and @entity38 - who were referred to by pseudonyms in the story - would have been able to tell @entity23 that there were serious inconsistencies between what @entity12 had told them and the story the article credulously repeated			1
@entity4 's story said that @entity12 , sitting in a dress stained in blood from a gang rape by seven different men just hours before , sobbed to her three friends , who told her to take it no further			1
still employed : @entity4 will not take any action against @entity59 , whose reporting was roundly discredited the story said the three - @entity38 , @entity62 and an unnamed woman - were preoccupied with the ' social price ' of being associated with rape accusations			1
@entity38 and @entity12 were painted as wannabe frat boys whose prospects of acceptance would be harmed			1
in fact , they revealed , @entity12 had no blood on her or obvious wounds - and the friends immediately suggested going to the police , which @entity12 said she was not prepared for			1
none of them was ever contacted by @entity23 - in @entity38 's case because @entity12 had falsely told her that he had refused to contribute			1
when asked whether @entity12 herself should have her identity revealed , @entity12 said : ' i do n't see any point in further shaming her			2
nobody can track her down , i 've even spoken with some friends from her home town - nobody knows where she is			0
' i think she 's learned her lesson			0
i think the @entity4 absolutely should be held accountable			0
' when asked whether @entity23 should be fired , he said : ' i think the @entity4 puts its reputation seriously at stake for not doing that			0
' i think the next article she comes out with it 's going to be hard for people to take seriously			2
' responding to the same question , @entity38 said : ' i think much more than anybody losing jobs or not losing jobs i think it 's important that @entity4 and other media outlets look at this more as a story of what not to do in reporting			1
' report : the @entity32 is expected to release a review of the botched story sunday night many were sceptical when @entity4 responded to the damning review sunday night by standing by @entity23 , her editors and her fact - checkers despite the avoidable problems their story had caused			2
@entity118 , the publisher of @entity4 , confirmed to the @entity119 that everybody would remain in their positions			0
he defended @entity23 's reporting , and described @entity12 as ' a really expert fabulist storyteller '			2
@entity59 , who went to ground as the row over her article erupted , issued an apology in the wake of the review , admitting ' i did not go far enough '			2
her piece credulously recounted @entity12 's tale the story of an anonymous student - referred to as @entity12 - who said she was lured to the @entity135 house and raped by a gang of seven men			1
anonymous : @entity12 has never been identified			2
police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation it described the ordeal , during which @entity12 said she was passed from man to man in an excruciating three hours of pain , during which she was also supposedly penetrated with a beer bottle upstairs during a pledging event			2
the article recounted the event in vivid , graphic detail based on @entity12 's account			1
it said : ' there was a heavy person on top of her , spreading open her thighs , and another person kneeling on her hair , hands pinning down her arms , sharp shards digging into her back , and excited male voices rising all around her			0
' when yet another hand clamped over her mouth , @entity12 bit it , and the hand became a fist that punched her in the face			2
the men surrounding her began to laugh			0
describing the moment she supposedly passed out from pain , it continued : ' someone handed her classmate a beer bottle			0
@entity12 stared at the young man , silently begging him not to go through with it			0
' and as he shoved the bottle into her , @entity12 fell into a stupor , mentally untethering from the brutal tableau , her mind leaving behind the bleeding body under assault on the floor			0
' the review spelled out extensive contact between @entity59 and @entity12 , spanning eight interviews			1
@entity59 wrote 405 pages of notes about the story			1
@entity12 also spent four hours speaking to a @entity4 fact - checker			2
@entity59 had asked repeatedly for the name of the supposed attacker , but @entity12 said she was not ' comfortable ' with the idea of him being contacted for the story			1
but they ultimately decided to rely on her for virtually all the information in the account , which led to inconsistencies not being discovered until after publication			0
@entity59 asked @entity12 again for the name once the public interrogation of her account began			1
this time she agreed - but it emerged she did not even know how to spell the surname of the man , referred to as ' @entity216 ' in the story			0
experts at @entity219 concluded that @entity59 , her editors , and the fact - checking department all failed to try hard enough to speak to the accused , and other people mentioned in the story			1
claims : the story published in november focused on a @entity1 student named @entity12 who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus ' @entity135 fraternity two years ago			1
above , the frat house on january 15 , 2015 another possible way @entity59 could have found out inconsistencies in the story would have been giving fuller details to the fraternity and @entity1 when asking them for comment , the review said			1
@entity239 , the chapter president of @entity135 , was asked to comment on the allegations without being given dates of the supposed attack or any details about who was involved			0
he told the review : ' it was complete bull * * * t. they were n't telling me what they were going to write about			0
they were n't telling me any dates or details			0
' when the full story was published , @entity135 responded by pointing out there had been no party on the date @entity12 gave			1
they also said that - despite claims of a pledging ritual taking place at the time - the fraternity house was then home to no pledges			0
the review concluded : ' @entity4 's repudiation of the main narrative in a rape on @entity15 is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable			1
' the failure encompassed reporting , editing , editorial supervision and fact - checking			0
' the magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that , if pursued , would likely have led the magazine 's editors to reconsider publishing @entity12 's narrative so prominently , if at all			1
' the published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine 's reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from			2
' it recommended that @entity4 tighten its procedures around fact - checking and offer more details when requesting comment from subjects			0
it also questioned the use of pseudonyms , and said the magazine should consider banning them			0
at the same time as publishing the review , @entity4 announced that it was ' officially retracting ' the story , which has amassed more than 2.7million views online			0
the page where the story was hosted until sunday night now redirected to the @entity219 review , which has the subtitle ' an anatomy of a journalistic failure '			0
@entity305 , one of @entity12 's editors , described the scandal over the article as ' it 's been an extraordinarily painful and humbling experience '			1
he later added : ' ultimately , we were too deferential to our rape victim ; we honored too many of her requests in our reporting			0
' we should have been much tougher , and in not doing that , we maybe did her a disservice			0
' in a personal statement released online , @entity59 said : ' reading the @entity219 account of the mistakes and misjudgments in my reporting was a brutal and humbling experience			0
' i want to offer my deepest apologies : to @entity4 's readers , to my @entity4 editors and colleagues , to the @entity1 community , and to any victims of sexual assault who may feel fearful as a result of my article			2
she said that as a reporter she must : ' weigh my compassion against my journalistic duty to find the truth			0
' however , in the case of @entity12 and her account of her traumatic rape , i did not go far enough to verify her story			2
' i allowed my concern for @entity12 's well - being , my fear of re-traumatizing her , and my confidence in her credibility to take the place of more questioning and more facts			1
these are mistakes i will not make again			0

@entity355 published a rape on @entity15 in november 2014 issue
graphically recounted supposed gang - rape of @entity1 student
@entity59 wrote article based on interviews with victim ' @entity12 '
did not speak to @entity12 or @entity38 , who were portrayed poorly
they could have revealed @entity12 's *unreliability* before story went to press
@entity38 today took the magazine to task and said its reputation is shot
