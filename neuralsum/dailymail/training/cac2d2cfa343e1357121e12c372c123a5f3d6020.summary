people who have lucid dreams have superior problem - solving skills , scientists claim			1
researchers say that people who can recognise that they are dreaming while being sound asleep , can solve problems in the waking world better than those who remain unaware of the dream until they wake up			1
this is because they are have an extra level of insight , according to a new study			1
researchers say that people who have lucid dreams - those who can recognise that they are dreaming while being sound asleep ( stock image ) - can solve problems in the waking world better than those who remain unaware of the dream until they wake up the concept of lucid dreaming was thrust into the spotlight in the 2010 film @entity22 , where dreamers were able to spot incongruities within their dream			1
experts believe that some people have lucid dreams because they have an extra level of insight			1
this means that their brains detect they are in a dream because events would not make sense otherwise			1
this cognitive ability translates to the waking world when it comes to finding the solution to a problem , by spotting hidden connections or inconsistencies , according to scientists at the @entity44			1
the concept of lucid dreaming was thrust into the spotlight in the 2010 film @entity22 , where dreamers were able to spot incongruities within their dream			1
a screenshot of the film , starring @entity52 is shown lucid dreams suggest that a person has superior problem solving abilities when they are awake , according to this latest study			1
and the content of dreams has been interpreted since the ancient conisations of @entity61 and @entity62 , where dreaming was considered a supernatural intervention			0
in @entity62 , dreams were considered prophetic or omens			0
a 16th century @entity67 book on dreams raised the question of lucidity - how we know we are dreaming and how we know we are awake , in his famous book , @entity72 , @entity73 argued that the motivation of all dream content is wish - fulfilment and that the root of a dream is found in the events of the day preceding the dream , which he called the ' day residue			2
' he suggested that adult dreams could not be easily interpreted by the individual who had them , but that the dreams expressed latent thoughts in their subconscious			0
later , @entity91 said that dreams shed light on the unconscious of a person and their world and could contain hidden symbols			0
the study , published in the @entity100 ’s journal , @entity101 , is the first empirical study to demonstrate the relationship between lucid dreaming and insight			2
‘ it is believed that for dreamers to become lucid while asleep , they must see past the overwhelming reality of their dream state , and recognise that they are dreaming , ’ said dr @entity105 , senior lecturer at the @entity106			0
‘ the same cognitive ability was found to be demonstrated while awake by a person ’s ability to think in a different way when it comes to solving problems			2
’ the study examined 68 participants aged between 18 and 25 who had experienced different levels of lucid dreaming - from never to several times a month			2
they were asked to solve 30 problems designed to test insight			0
each problem consisted of three words and a solution word			0
each of the three words could be combined with the solution word to create a new compound word			0
for example with the words ‘ sand ’ , ‘ mile ’ and ‘ age ’ , the linking word would be ‘ stone ’			0
results showed that frequent lucid dreamers solved 25 per cent more of the insight problems than non-lucid dreamers .			0

scientists from the @entity44 say that people who have lucid dreams have an extra level of insight
this means that their brains detect they are in a dream because events would not make sense otherwise
