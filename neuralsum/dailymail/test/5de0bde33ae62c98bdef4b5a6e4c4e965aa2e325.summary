former @entity1 captain @entity0 believes @entity2 should not walk straight back into the international set - up , even if he piles on the runs for @entity5 this season			1
@entity2 has returned to the @entity7 in a bid to stake a claim for an @entity1 recall , although the 34 - year - old only managed 19 runs against @entity13 on sunday			1
@entity1 were held to a draw in the opening test of a three - match series against @entity17 last week , and calls for a @entity2 comeback continue to linger ahead of the @entity19 this summer			1
@entity2 scored 170 in his first outing for @entity5 this season but scored just 19 against @entity13 ' there are a few bridges that still need to be rebuilt , ' said @entity0 , who had just penned a congratulation message to @entity25 , @entity1 's leading @entity27 wicket - taker , as part of @entity30 's celebratory flag tour			1
' even if @entity2 scores runs there might not be spaces available			1
if @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 play well , there might not be a place for him			2
' you 've got to have somebody who is n't playing well to get @entity2 in			1
' he does n't just come straight back - that would be unfair on the people in there at the moment			0
' if he does get runs , fine , but that 's not the end of it			2
' if people are playing well in the team , why should he just get straight in ? ' @entity2 is keen to play for @entity1 again after being sacked in 2014 @entity36 and @entity35 both hit centuries in @entity53 while @entity37 also showed signs of good form with scores of 83 and 59			1
the scorecard was less encouraging for @entity1 captain @entity58 , however , who could only manage 11 and 13 , stretching his run without a test century to 33 innings			2
@entity58 's poor performances saw him removed as one - day captain before the @entity64 earlier this year and @entity0 admits more questions will be asked of the @entity1 skipper if he fails to find runs against @entity17			1
' @entity58 knows what he 's got to do , he 's got to get some runs , ' @entity0 said			1
' we can keep speculating but i suspect at the end of the @entity17 series , they 'll look at it and if he has n't got any runs there might be some questions asked			0
@entity35 scored a century in the first test against @entity17 ' he might possibly get the series against @entity81 - the fact is @entity58 has got more 100s than anyone else has and people do go through bad patches in their careers			0
' @entity58 has had a break , when he was left out of the one - day series , he 's had time to get himself sorted			0
' maybe he needs a break from the captaincy , that 's for people to sit and decide , i suspect it 's about the runs though , not the captaincy			0
' he 's a well - respected man in the team , the fact is he 's a batsman , he 's a captain and if he fails to get the runs somebody will have to make a decision			0
' @entity58 's future may be affected by who the @entity103 chooses for the new director of cricket role , created to replace sacked managing director @entity107			0
@entity0 has signed a giant flag congratulating @entity25 on becoming the leading @entity1 wicket taker in test matches @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 have all been mentioned in connection with the post , but @entity116 is unsure what the point of the position will be			1
' i 've tried to think what the role could be , ' @entity0 said			2
' if it 's going to be someone more hands on with the team , how is that going to affect the coach ? ' can it be any different to the job @entity107 did ? you do need someone in charge of the overall structure			0
' at the end of the day , it 's all about the players - it 's about how they perform			0
' i just hope the @entity103 do n't rush into the decision and they get the right person , because different people will do a different type of job			0
' former @entity142 president @entity0 was signing @entity30 's ' @entity144 ' flag which will be touring the country this week			2
@entity30 is celebrating @entity25 becoming @entity1 's all - time leading @entity27 wicket - taker by giving 10 per cent off its entire cricket range			2
