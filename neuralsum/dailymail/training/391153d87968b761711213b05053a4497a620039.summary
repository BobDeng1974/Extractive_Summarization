the moon once had a magnetic core which helped it generate a magnetic field stronger than @entity4 's is now , researchers say			1
they believe a lunar dynamo , a molten , churning core at the centre of the moon , may have powered an intense magnetic field for at least 1 billion years			1
however , researchers are still baffled by how it was powered , and when it ended			2

planetary dynamos are generated by the process of induction , in which the energy of turbulent , conducting fluids is transformed into a magnetic field			0
the motion of @entity4 ’s liquid core is powered by the cooling of the planet , which stirs up buoyant fluid from the surrounding liquid — similar to what happens in a lava lamp			0
' we think planets generate magnetic fields by moving electrically conducting fluids inside them , ' said study co-author @entity36 , a planetary scientist at @entity37			0
flowing metal in @entity4 's core makes the heart of the planet a dynamo - a generator of electrical current - which in turn generates @entity4 's magnetic field			1

' we have recently argued from magnetic studies of @entity61 samples that the moon also generated a dynamo in its molten metal core			2
' our data suggest that , despite the moon ’s tiny size — only 1 percent of the @entity4 ’s mass — its dynamo was surprisingly intense ( stronger than @entity4 ’s field today ) and long - lived , persisting from at least 4.2 billion years ago until at least 3.56 billion years ago			1
' this period , which overlaps the early epoch of intense solar system - wide meteoroid bombardment and coincides with the oldest known records of life on @entity4 , comes just before our earliest evidence of the @entity4 ’s dynamo			0
' the moon today does not have a global magnetic field			1
however , moon rocks that astronauts collected during the @entity61 missions suggested the moon once had a magnetic field billions of years ago			1
but scientists were uncertain whether the moon generated a magnetic field the same way @entity4 does , or if the magnetic fields seen on the moon were instead produced by outside forces			1

however , moon rocks that astronauts collected during the @entity61 missions suggested the moon once had a magnetic field billions of years ago			2
for instance , cosmic impacts on the moon could have sparked super-heated plasma that generated strong , brief magnetic fields , explaining the magnetized rocks the astronauts discovered			0
@entity36 and former @entity37 student @entity102 's review , published in @entity103 , believe the corew ould have been ' a convective dynamo powered by crystallization of an inner core could potentially sustain a lunar magnetic field for billions of years , ' he told @entity37			1
' an exotic dynamo mechanism that could explain the moon ’s strong field intensity is that the core was stirred by motion of the solid overlying mantle , analogous to a blender			0
' the moon ’s mantle was moving because its spin axis is precessing , or wobbling , and such motion was more vigorous billions of years ago , when the moon was closer to the @entity4			0

@entity123 dynamo was a molten , churning core at the centre of the moon
powered an intense magnetic field for at least 1 billion years that was far stronger than @entity4 's is today
researchers are still baffled by how it was powered , and when it ended
