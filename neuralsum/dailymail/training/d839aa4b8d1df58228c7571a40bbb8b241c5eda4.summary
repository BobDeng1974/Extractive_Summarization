by @entity0 published : 20:19 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 20:29 est , 23 october 2012 the latest craze to sweep @entity2 is n’t a new brand of coffee , or even some underground indie band – it ’s a conservative evangelical church			1
but rather than hymns and hallelujahs , the @entity7 in @entity2 caters to a niche audience of contemporary young adults , and no subject is off limits			1
those in the congregation regularly discuss traditionally taboo topics of sex and drinking , but in stark contrast , they hold many traditional biblical views and think homosexuality is a sin			1
@entity2 's best : @entity7 's services are held in a converted warehouse and feature rock ' n roll music founding father : pastor @entity28 , pictured , founded the church in the late 1990s ; since then , the size of the congregation has grown exponentially enter @entity28 , who founded the church in the late 1990s			1
he has become something of a symbol of the religious organization , often wearing signature rolled jeans and a blazer			0
he said that he was motivated to start a new kind of church after he realized most of the members of local churches were female , and the men , too , were effeminate			2
he said in a 2006 interview : ‘ if you want to win a war , you have to get the men			0
’ thus began his tough - love approach to @entity49			0
@entity28 holds services in a massive warehouse in @entity2 , though @entity7 now has several auxiliary campuses all over @entity53 , with another in @entity55 , and one in @entity57			1
the services often feature rock and roll music with guitars , bass , and drums , as opposed to traditional hymns , perhaps played on piano or organ			0
the website states the atmosphere is ‘ casual , reflective , and open to all			0
’ the church ’s @entity70 page shows a long line of events , where led lights are given to children at a party for @entity78 heroine @entity77 , and a wing cook - off , complete with artisan sauces			2
likewise , many members sport tattoos , and enjoy indie rock - not things typically associated with a conservative @entity49 movement			0
good clean fun : a member dresses up as the @entity88 for a @entity89 at @entity90 catering : food trucks provided snacks for one church event ; one member snapped this picture on @entity96 and @entity28 himself does n’t shy away from topics , talking to millennial and gen y - ers about seemingly out - of - bounds topics like oral sex , as @entity102 first reported			1
he also teaches that women should submit to their husbands as the church submits to @entity106			2
as @entity102 points out , @entity28 ’s teachings are very in - line with hot - topic secular views of the decline of young men and the rising of young women			1
but , as the publication notes , @entity28 believes that women ’s strength is caused by men ’s weakness			2
the church offers counselling in gender roles			1
there are many stories of couples who were unhappy in their marriages , often times because @entity7 said they were n’t submitting to their @entity126 - given roles of wife as nurturer and husband as bread - winner			1
those who have chosen to leave the church have met a fair amount of controversy			0
a blog called @entity135 chronicles the stories of those who left , giving reasons of why they felt it right to go and how they thought the church wronged them			0
prayer : members of @entity7 pictured praying before the start of a service mingling : members celebrated at a @entity7 campus with sno - cones , cookies , and popcorn one former member , @entity152 , said that he was punished after it was revealed he was ‘ sexually involved ’ with another church member			2
in the @entity161 issued , it was alleged : ‘ the repercussions of @entity152 ’s sin have been widespread … as a result , he is under church discipline with the hope and goal of full restoration upon walking in a repentant lifestyle			0
’ he had to sign a contract over his ‘ plan of discipline ’ that involved writing out the chronology of his so - called illicit relationship and share it with a pastor			0
he was also to write a list of people he sinned against			0
a feature in the stranger last january questioned if @entity7 was in fact a church , or just a cult , churning out the types of men and women who would be beneficial to it , citing several cases where members balked at one part or another of the church and were punished for not adhering to the church ’s authority			1
the article notes that @entity28 believes in his ' womb to tomb ' philosophy - of creating and cultivating believers in @entity106 - but ' only if ( members ) do n't ask too many questions			2

@entity7 founded in late 90s to *attract* young men and women
now one of @entity2 's *fastest* - growing congregations , with auxiliary campuses in @entity53 , @entity200 , and @entity201
while church does n't shy away from many ' taboo ' topics , some question its fairness in teaching gender roles
