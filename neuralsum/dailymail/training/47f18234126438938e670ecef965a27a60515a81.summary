by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 7:14 pm on 3rd november 2011 @entity3 's protesters were handed a two - month reprieve yesterday after the authorities offered to allow them to stay until the @entity6			1
in a humiliating climbdown , the @entity7 said it would abandon legal action against the campers if they leave peacefully in early 2012			1
but protesters are already aiming to stay through the @entity12 next summer – which would guarantee international attention for their cause and embarrassment for the government			1
hard at work : a protester with a mask of @entity20 on his head cleans the @entity23 camp area outside @entity24			1
and a clash between campsite and authorities is likely before next weekend , when saturday ’s @entity28 will bring tens of thousands of spectators to the @entity7 , and @entity31 , as both feature services at @entity3 ’s			0
as late as @entity32 was preparing to hand the camp a 48 - hour eviction notice , but was forced to change its policy after the @entity24 publicly backed the protesters			1
four of the protesters then met representatives from the local authority in an attempt to resolve issues in a non-violent and non-confrontational manner			2
reprieve : protesters were due to be served with legal notices , but that action has been called off archbishop : dr @entity48 ( left ) has kept his counsel since the protest began but , after the resignation of @entity53 @entity52 ( right ) , he has spoken and backed the demonstrators chancellor @entity55 was last night on collision course with @entity58 leaders after it emerged he has serious doubts about moves to bring in a ‘ @entity64 ’ tax on bankers			1
the @entity66 tax will hit shares , bonds and currency deals – but bankers fears it will harm @entity72 ’s position as a financial centre			1
as one of the central planks of the protests at @entity24 , the tax is also backed by @entity78 dr @entity48			1
he said : ‘ there ’s an impatience with a return to “ business as usual ” – represented by still soaring bonuses and little visible change in banking practices			0
’ but a private letter by mr @entity55 to bank chiefs claims the ‘ necessary international consensus does not exist ’ to impose the tax			2
as part of last night ’s deal , the @entity7 asked protesters to reduce the number of tents to enable access to @entity24 and abide by health and safety legislation			2
@entity97 , 49 , who attended the meeting , said : ‘ they want a slight but visible reduction of tents , but otherwise we can stay until the @entity6			2
‘ i think this is a huge climbdown for the @entity7			0
at the start of this week it was taking legal action to evict us and about to hand us our notice			1
now it is allowing us to stay until the @entity6			2
’ the offer will now be discussed at the camp ’s general assembly , which is held twice a day , and with a vote on the proposal expected today			0
but many protesters have already expressed a desire to stay long - term under the cathedral			1
camp spokesman @entity117 said : ‘ some of our camp say it should be a permanent back - drop and we should be here for the @entity12 and beyond			0
‘ but things are changing so fast that we ca n’t really say anything for certain			0
guessing at any sort of timeframe is something we ca n’t really do			0
we ’ve had offers of better tents so we can upgrade the camp which would enable us to stay for longer			2
’ the looming difficulty for @entity132 authorities now is the annual @entity28 next saturday , when a parade of 6,000 people , including a large military presence , attracts thousands of spectators			0
mr @entity117 said : ‘ we wo n’t take the tents down for either @entity31 or the @entity28 but we will work with @entity3 ’s			0
‘ we ’ll be provocative but peaceful			0
we want to get people involved but not anything disruptive			0
we want this to be a safe space for campers and visitors , and it ’s not about interrupting the cathedral ’s work			0
’ protest leaders have met with @entity3 's officials to discuss were health and safety and to ensure that upcoming events at the cathedral run smoothly ' @entity153 ' : @entity154 became the second of the cathedral 's senior clergy to resign in less than a week an unlikely crowd : a demonstrator directs questions to @entity161 ( second from right ) , and the @entity163 , @entity164 ( right ) at the weekend there are now around 24 occupy tent protests around @entity167			1
one such rally is taking place in @entity170 , where tents have been pitched on the cathedral - owned @entity172 for the past three weeks			0
@entity174 has declared the protest illegal but those on the @entity177 are understood to be ready with a legal challenge if an attempt is made to move them			2
occupy @entity170 : people walk past tents belonging to anti-capitalist protesters @entity184 : protesters in @entity170 say they have no intention of leaving yet anti-capitalist : a protester smokes a cigarette as he sits beside a fire at the @entity170 camp			1

@entity193 backs dr @entity48 ' call for greater *responsibility* by high *earners*
@entity20 stops short of supporting @entity199 's call for ' @entity64 tax '
@entity203 legal action against protesters
occupy @entity72 group now vows to stay until at least @entity207
