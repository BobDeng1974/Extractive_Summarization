by @entity1 reporter published : 00:38 est , 17 june 2012 updated : 09:18 est , 17 june 2012 rapper @entity3 performed in @entity4 last night - and , contrary to rumours beforehand , he was not arrested over his role in a vicious nightclub brawl with @entity8			1
however , the notorious fight did make an impact on @entity3 's @entity11 show on saturday , as he appeared to refer to his troubles twice during his set			1
the concert came as it emerged that the nightclub where @entity3 and @entity8 fought over @entity17 star @entity16 , sending several injured people to hospital , has been closed ' indefinitely '			1
scroll down to see the video of @entity3 and @entity8 performance : @entity3 managed to get through his @entity4 concert without being apprehended by police @entity3 performed at the @entity24 in the town of @entity26 , and opened his set by saying : ' when i woke up this morning , i had to think about a lot of things			1
' but he continued : ' but the only thing i gave a f * * * about was that i was in @entity4 tonight , ' according to the @entity32			2
later in the set , he seemed to make another reference to wednesday night 's scuffle , when he said : ' it 's last call and you 're really too drunk to give a f * * *			2
' a n * * * * * in the corner is standing there looking at you funny			2
you bump elbows with him on the way to the bathroom , but really there 's only one n * * * * * that you got to think about			2
' @entity49 sources had suggested that the star could be arrested at the concert if he did not turn himself in , but by the time the evening came around there was no sign that he would be taken into custody			1
meanwhile it was reported by @entity57 that @entity58 , the nightclub in @entity4 's @entity61 district , has been shut down indefinitely over a number of violations apparently unrelated to the a-list brawl			2
earlier a second bystander released photos of her injuries that were a result of the flying bottles during the fight			2
no love lost : @entity8 seen in @entity4 earlier this week , and @entity3 , right , seen in @entity72 in march			1

@entity80 had to get stitches on her right hand and has a bruise in the middle of her forehead			2
' i heard people screaming ... so i tried to get away from the action and hid behind a couch , ' she told the site			2
what she did n't know at the time was that the fight , which left the club looking like a war zone with broken bottles everywhere , was supposedly caused by notorious rapper @entity8 sending @entity3 , whose real name is @entity3 , a bottle of champagne			1
while the gesture may seem nice , the closest connection that the two men have is that they have both been romantically linked to @entity107			2
that appears to be too close for comfort , as @entity3 reportedly sent the bottle back to @entity8 with a note reading ' i 'm f * * * * * * the love of your life , deal with it '			1

police seem to agree , as the @entity136 reported that while they are considering @entity8 a ' witness and victim ' , they are now on the hunt for @entity3			1
' i believe the police are building a case against @entity3 and his thugs , ' @entity8 's lawyer @entity140 told the paper			1
@entity146 ' thugs ' included fellow rapper @entity147 and a bevy of security handlers			2
another serious question comes for @entity8 , however , as some of his own posse may have been known gang members , which would be a violation of his probation agreement for his previous assault charge			1
