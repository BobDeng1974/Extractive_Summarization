’ @entity16 have a deep bench of presidential candidates to choose from in 2016 , with as many as a dozen current and former lawmakers , including @entity15 , a former governor himself , hinting at plans to form exploratory committees next year , and it would be highly unusual for the party ’s most recent presidential nominee to compete for the presidency again			1
