by @entity0 published : 20:35 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 06:38 est , 11 march 2014 @entity2 , the adventurous and news - making author and reporter who skewered the marketing of @entity6 in ‘ @entity7 ’ and tracked his personal journey from sympathizer to scourge of convicted killer @entity11 in the blockbuster ‘ @entity12 , ’ died monday at age 71			1
@entity2 , who announced last year that he had been diagnosed with inoperable prostate cancer , died from complications related to his disease			1
his attorney and longtime friend @entity18 said he died at a hospital in @entity21 , @entity22			0
few journalists of his time so intrepidly pursued a story , burned so many bridges or more memorably placed themselves in the narrative , whether insisting on the guilt of @entity11 after seemingly befriending him or moving next door to @entity31 's house for a most unauthorized biography of the former @entity34 governor and @entity36 vice presidential candidate			1
passed on : veteran writer and journalist @entity2 , seen here at the home he rented next to @entity31 's in @entity39 , @entity34 to write a book about her , is dead prolific : @entity2 covered everything from politics to sports and travel			1
he suffered from terminal prostate cancer the tall , talkative @entity2 had early dreams of becoming a sports reporter and wrote books about soccer , horse racing and travel			1
but he was best known for two works that became touchstones in their respective genres — campaign books ( ‘ @entity7 ’ ) and true crime ( ‘ @entity12 ’ )			1
in both cases , he had become fascinated by the difference between public image and private reality			0
@entity2 was a columnist for the @entity62 in 1968 when an advertising man told him he was joining @entity65 's presidential campaign			1
intrigued that candidates had advertising teams , @entity2 was inspired to write a book and tried to get access to @entity65			1
the @entity71 turned him down , but , according to @entity2 , @entity6 aide @entity70 allowed him in , one of the last times the ever - suspicious @entity6 would permit a journalist so much time around him			1
garment and other @entity6 aides were apparently unaware , or unconcerned , that @entity2 ' heart was very much with the anti-war agitators the candidate so despised			1
the @entity36 's victory that fall capped a once - unthinkable comeback for the former vice president , who had declared six years earlier that he was through with politics			2
having lost the 1960 election in part because of his pale , sweaty appearance during his first debate with @entity87 and aware of his reputation as a partisan willing to play dirty , @entity6 had restricted his public outings and presented himself as a new and more mature candidate			2
@entity2 was far from the only writer to notice @entity6 's reinvention , but few offered such raw and unflattering details			1
‘ @entity7 ’ was published in 1969 , spent months on the @entity96 ' best - seller list and made @entity2 an eager media star			2
he quit the @entity62 and followed more personal interests			0
he wrote a novel , ‘ @entity112 , ’ and the idiosyncratic ‘ heroes , ’ a memoir that told of the breakup of his first marriage and romance with his eventual second wife , @entity106 , and his failed quest for role models , among them author @entity109 and @entity111 sen. @entity110			0
in 1979 , he was a columnist for the @entity114 when an argument without end was born : @entity2 was approached by @entity11 , a fellow @entity117 resident , about a possible book on the 1970 killings for which the physician and former @entity121 was being charged			1
diverse interests : @entity2 's @entity31 book @entity124 seen as a tawdry exercise in gossip mongering by some , but his willingness to go the extra mile by literally moving in next door to the former governor made him stand apart			1
@entity12 , on the other hand , was a massive success and famously follows @entity2 's befriending a @entity121 - turned - physician accused of slaying his wife and child in 1970 in the early hours of feb. 17 , 1970 , @entity11 's pregnant wife and two small children were stabbed and beaten to death at the family 's home in @entity142 , @entity143 the date , location and identities of the victims are virtually the only facts of the case not in dispute			1
@entity11 , who sustained a punctured lung and minor injuries , had insisted that the house was overrun by a gang of drug - crazed hippies that chanted slogans such as ‘ acid is groovy ’ and spelled ‘ pig ’ in blood on a bedroom wall , a murderous rampage seemingly inspired by the then - recent @entity163 killings			0
but investigators suspected otherwise , believing that @entity11 killed his family and arranged the apartment to make it appear others had committed the crime			0
@entity11 was initially cleared of charges , then indicted , then finally brought to trial in 1979			0
he was found guilty and sentenced to three consecutive life terms			0
groundbreaking : @entity2 gained renown when he skewered the marketing of @entity6 in @entity7			1
his work became the model for political journalism ‘ @entity12 , ’ published in 1983 , became one of the most widely read and contested true crime books in history			2
@entity2 wrote not just of the case but of his own conclusions			2
he had at first found @entity11 charming and sincere but came to believe he was a sociopath who 'd committed the killings while in a frenzied state brought on by diet pills			0
@entity2 ' findings were n't welcomed by @entity11 or by some fellow journalists			2
@entity11 sued in 1987 , alleging @entity2 had tricked him by pretending to believe in his innocence , and he received an out - of - court settlement of $ 325,000			2
@entity193 writer @entity192 cited @entity2 as a prime case of the reporter as a ‘ kind of confidence man , preying on people 's vanity , ignorance , or loneliness , gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse			1
’ @entity2 wrote in his defense : ‘ the attempt to manipulate through ' cons and lies ' was — it seems clear to me now in retrospect — something @entity11 engaged in with me			2
appearance of the book was forceful proof he had not succeeded			0
’ @entity2 hoped to have the last word with the e-book ‘ @entity215			0
’ ‘ @entity11 was convicted of the murders of his wife and two young daughters in 1979 , ’ @entity2 said in 2012			2
‘ in all the years since , every court that has considered the case — including the @entity222 — has upheld that verdict in every respect			0
@entity11 is guilty not simply beyond a reasonable doubt , but beyond any doubt			0
no amount of speculation , conjecture and innuendo can change that			0
’ @entity2 , who had been working on a book about his illness , wrote openly about his personal and professional follies and setbacks , whether cheating on his first wife or helping himself to the gourmet crabmeat in @entity109 's kitchen			1
he struggled financially at times and battled depression and alcohol abuse			0
a 1993 biography of sen. @entity87 , ‘ the last brother , ’ was widely ridiculed for including invented dialogue			0
none of his latter books approached the popularity of ‘ @entity12 ’ or such other crime works as ‘ @entity249 ’ and ‘ @entity250			0
’ he returned a $ 1 million advance to write a book on the @entity254 murder trial , expressing disgust that the former football star had been acquitted			0
but by the 21st century he had cleaned himself up			0
he was an enthusiastic commentator on @entity257 , posting regular updates about his health and current events			0
and he was back in the news , if not on the best - seller lists , with a biography of @entity31 , ‘ @entity124 , ’ which failed to sell many copies despite allegations of drug use and a premarital fling @entity31 had with basketball star @entity268			1
the real headlines were in the reporting : anxious for a close look into @entity31 's world , @entity2 scored a front - row seat when he rented a house next door to her in @entity39 , @entity34			1
read some of @entity2 's biography on @entity279 great @entity278 ...			2

@entity2 skewered the @entity6 campaign 's use of *corporate* - like marketing to sell the candidate like a *consumer* product
he *infamously* befriended a @entity121 accused of murdering his wife and child to write best - selling @entity12 before deciding the man was guilty
in 2010 he *infuriated* the @entity291 when he moved into a home *extremely* close to theirs in @entity39 , @entity34 to write a book about @entity31
he suffered from terminal prostate cancer
