by @entity0 published : 17:34 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 02:14 est , 4 april 2013 @entity1 has been urged to drop his plans to regulate the @entity3 because they ‘ run counter to bedrock principles of a democracy ’			1
some of @entity9 ’s leading journalists have written to the prime minister saying he will encourage dictators around the world to suppress their newspapers unless he takes a ‘ step back ’ from creating a new watchdog backed up by statute			1
their letter warns that @entity18 will lose its ‘ moral authority ’ to criticise authoritarianism elsewhere if it brings in a statutory response to the @entity20 into press standards			1
under fire : an association of some of the top journalists in the @entity9 has written to @entity1 , pictured , to urge him to rethink @entity3 reform plans the @entity29 signed up to a deal thrashed out at 2.30am last month which will see a @entity31 , underpinned by law , used to establish a new watchdog to police the press regulator			1
controversially , the deal was drawn up in the office of @entity37 leader @entity36 in the presence of four members of pressure group @entity40			0
media organisations in the @entity18 have warned that the plans , which will see papers that refuse to sign up threatened with punitive damages in court , are likely to be in breach of @entity48 law			1
mr @entity1 backs the plans but the @entity49 compares them to draconian rules in place in @entity52			1
the letter , signed by the committee ’s executive director , @entity56 , says : ‘ those news organisations that opt out of the mechanism face the prospect of “ exemplary damages ” , a concept that reminds us of @entity64 ’s unpalatable media law in its potential to foster self - censorship and chill investigative journalism			0
’ it says statutory under - pinning does ‘ run counter to bedrock principles of a democracy ’			0
powerful members : @entity73 , left , founder of news website the @entity75 and former @entity77 anchor @entity76 , right , are on the board of the @entity49 to protect journalists it adds : ' it is the job of journalists to hold governments to account and thus ensure the full participation of citizens			0
' a natural antagonism therefore exists between the press and those in power -- but in some instances , governments seek to pass legislation to restrict the media and even criminalize investigative reporting			0
' it would be highly regrettable if such leaders could point to the @entity18 parliament as precedent for introducing statutory media controls or regulations			1
' the committee , based in @entity102 , is an independent , non-profit organisation that promotes press freedom worldwide			0
its directors include senior figures from : the three main @entity9 television news networks @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity77 ; the @entity109 , the @entity110 and the @entity111 ; the @entity102 and @entity113 magazines			1
@entity76 , one of @entity9 ’s best known former news anchors and @entity73 , founder of the @entity75 , the @entity9 news website , sit on its board			2
their letter warns that the ‘ hasty ’ way the deal was thrashed out sends the ‘ wrong message ’ to the rest of the world where dictators want to ‘ rein in irksome reporters ’			2
it says : ‘ prime minister , we urge you to take a step back from the current proposals , which do not take into account the implications for press freedom beyond @entity137			0
deal : plans to reform regulation of the @entity3 were thrashed out after @entity141 published his report into newspaper practice ' online journalists and bloggers and those outside the @entity148 - based , national newspaper establishment need to have their voices heard too			0
' the haste with which this deal has been put together leaves too many unanswered questions			0
‘ journalists , especially those working under authoritarian regimes , are watching and hoping that their colleagues in @entity18 can find a better solution than regulation anchored in law			2
‘ mr @entity1 , we think that in the interests of global press freedom , you should allow them the opportunity to do so			1
' many responsible journalists in @entity18 acknowledge the sins of @entity137 , but most argue that these can be addressed through existing legislation			2
' use the criminal law to prosecute criminal behavior ; make the civil law more accessible to the victims of unscrupulous newspapers ; and do not try to impose standards of fairness and accuracy in newsrooms through statute			2
' last month the @entity179 highlighted how the world ’s media has reacted with astonishment to the plans to shackle newspapers with state regulation			0
even the @entity186 and @entity187 scorned the plans			0
newspapers in @entity189 accused the @entity18 of censorship while a state - owned @entity187 tv channel announced : ‘ the measure puts in danger freedom of expression and democracy			1

@entity9 *'s* leading journalist have warned that @entity18 will lose ' moral authority '
