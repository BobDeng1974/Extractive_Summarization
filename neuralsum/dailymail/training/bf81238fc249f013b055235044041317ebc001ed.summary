by @entity0 published : 13:45 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 15:15 est , 6 december 2012 @entity2 ceo @entity1 says the company will produce one of its existing lines of @entity7 computers in the @entity8 next year			1
in a series of interviews he revealed the giant will spend $ 100m to move a production line from @entity13 to the @entity8			2
he also spoke about his relationship with @entity2 co-founder @entity15 - and denied claims he was ' like a robot '			1
@entity2 ceo @entity1 has revealed plans to move one of the firm 's major production for its @entity7 computers to the @entity8 from @entity13 @entity1 made the comments in part of an interview taped for @entity27 's ' @entity26 , ' but aired thursday morning on ' today ' and posted on the network 's website			1
in a separate interview with @entity31 , he said that the company will spend $ 100 million in 2013 to move production of the line to the @entity8 from @entity13			2
' it ’s not known well that the engine for the @entity37 and @entity38 is made in the @entity8 , and many of these are also exported — the engine , the processor , ' he said			2
' the glass is made in @entity44 , and next year we are going to bring some production to the @entity8 on the @entity7 ' we ’re really proud of it			2
' we could have quickly maybe done just assembly , but it ’s broader because we wanted to do something more substantial			2
@entity2 's @entity51 computer could be the first to be manufactured in the @entity8 after the firm revealed it plans to spend $ 100m to move production from @entity13 ' so we ’ll literally invest over $ 100 million			1
' this does n’t mean that @entity2 will do it ourselves , but we ’ll be working with people , and we ’ll be investing our money			1
like most consumer electronics companies , @entity2 lets contract manufacturers assemble its products overseas			1
however , the assembly accounts for little of the cost of making a pc or smartphone			2
most of the cost lies in buying chips , and many of those are made in the @entity8 , @entity1 noted in his interview with @entity27			1
the company and its manufacturing partner @entity72 have faced significant criticism this year over working conditions at the @entity13 facilities where @entity2 products are assembled , prompting @entity72 to raise salaries			1
@entity2 ceo @entity1 has revealed plans to move production of one of its @entity7 computers from @entity13 to @entity8 @entity1 did n't say which line of computers would be produced in the @entity8 or where in the country they would be made			1
regardless , the @entity8 manufacturing line is expected to represent just a tiny piece of @entity2 overall production , with sales of iphones and @entity38 now dwarfing those of its computers			1
@entity1 said in his interview with @entity27 that companies like @entity2 chose to produce their products in places like @entity13 , not because of the lower costs associated with it , but because the manufacturing skills required just are n't present in the @entity8 anymore			1
he added that the consumer electronics world has never really had a big production presence in the @entity8 as a result , it 's really more about starting production in the @entity8 than bringing it back			2
@entity2 originally made its computers in the @entity8 it started outsourcing production in the mid- 90s , first by selling some plants to contract manufacturers , then by hiring manufacturers overseas			1
it assembled imacs in @entity109 , @entity110 , until 2004			0
the news comes a day after @entity2 posted its worst stock drop in four years , erasing $ 35 million in market capitalization			1
@entity2 shares fell $ 1.79 to $ 537 in thursday morning trading			1
@entity1 , left , with @entity15 at the launch of the @entity51 computer			1
@entity1 today said @entity15 ' best trait was his ability to change his mind @entity1 also revealed how @entity15 ' made @entity1 's elevation to ceo drama - free			1
' he goes , “ i never want you to ask what i would have done , ' said @entity1			1
' just do what ’s right - he was very clear			0
he was making this point , and he says , “ i hope you listen to my input if i want to input on something			0
” @entity129 said , “ of course			0
) but he was so clear , and i have to tell you that it ’s probably removed a tremendous burden from me that would have been there otherwise			0
and he repeated this much closer to his passing			0
i think in the second instance , i think he did that because he knew it would lift a burden			0
it was his way of making sure @entity2 would not be burdened by the past			1
' maybe the most underappreciated thing about @entity15 was that he had the courage to change his mind			1
and you know — it ’s a talent			2
' @entity1 also spoke about how he is perceived outside the firm			1
' the person you read about is robotic			0
' there are some good things about that , perhaps			0
) discipline comes to mind			2
but it sounds like there is just no emotion			0
people that know me , i do n’t think they would say that			0
i certainly am not a fist - pounder			0
that is n’t my style			0
but that and emotion are two different things			0
on @entity2 's remarkable year of innovation , he said : ' no company would have done what we did this year			1
we changed the vast majority of our @entity37 in a day			0
we did n’t kind of — you know , change a little bit here or there			2
' @entity38 , we changed the entire lineup in a day			0
the most successful product in consumer electronics history , and we change it all in a day and go with an ipad mini and a fourth - generation @entity38			2
' who else is doing this ? eighty percent of our revenues are from products that did n’t exist 60 days ago			0
is there any other company that would do that ? ' @entity2 's chief executive @entity1 , talks with @entity27 's @entity191 @entity1 spoke to @entity192 in one of his first major interviews he also addressed the firm 's issues with its @entity198 service			1
' we had a list of things that we thought would be a great customer experience , and we could n’t do it any other way than to do it ourselves			0
we set on a course some years ago and began to do that			0
' so it was n’t a matter of saying , ' strategically it ’s important that we not work with company x. ' we set out to give the customer something to provide a better experience			0
and the truth is it did n’t live up to our expectations			0
on @entity2 's litigation with @entity218 , he admitted ' it is awkward			1
for us , this is about values			0
' what we would like , in a perfect world , is for everyone to invent their own stuff			0
' but we want people to have their own ideas and invent their own stuff			0
so after lots of trying , we felt we had no other choice			0
' on why mobile software head @entity235 and retail chief @entity237 were replaced , @entity1 revealed : ' the key in the change that you ’re referencing is my deep belief that collaboration is essential for innovation — and i did n’t just start believing that			1
' i ’ve always believed that			0
it ’s always been a core belief at @entity2			1
@entity15 very deeply believed this … so how do we keep doing that and keep taking it to an even higher level ? you have to have to be an a-plus at collaboration			2

@entity2 boss @entity1 revealed plan in first major interview
also spoke of his *admiration* for @entity15 , claiming the @entity2 co-founder 's biggest talent was his ability to change his mind
