many people set the mood for a romantic night in with candles , but now they could use a genetically engineered glowing plant for a date with a difference			0
a light - producing plant called @entity7 that glows like a firefly has been created by @entity10 scientists			1
bioengineers spliced genes from bioluminescent bacteria with a pot plant to create the plant , which can be used as a lamp in the dark			2
a light - producing plant called @entity7 that glows like a firefly has been created by @entity10 scientists			1
it is pictured in daylight ( left ) when it looks like a regular pot plant , but it can be seen to emit light in darkness @entity30 , the company behind the innovation , which is based in @entity28 , @entity29 , claim @entity7 is the first light - emitting plant			1
it is a genetically - modified version of a regular pot plant called @entity33 and glows continuously during its lifetime			1
the firm is auctioning the first batch of glowing shrubs and taking pre-orders for further plants it is are currently nurturing			2
the phenomenon of living organisms glowing in the nature is called bioluminescence			0
there are over twenty independently evolved bioluminescent mechanisms found in nature as seen in glow worms , bobtail squids , deep - sea anglerfish and bacteria			0
autoluminescent plants - shrubs that produce light - are created by introducing the light - emitting pathway from marine bacteria into a plant 's chloroplasts			1
the company said that its plants are similar to fireflies			0
its light emission ‘ machinery ’ is encoded in its cells to let it constantly emit visible light during its life cycle of between two and three months			0
‘ the glow of @entity7 is best described as comparable in strength to starlight , ’ the company said			0
it suggests that people should appreciate the plant ’s ‘ dim ambient glow ’ in a darkened room and it might take a few minutes for their eyes to adjust to appreciate the effect			0
the plant was created by splicing genes from a bioluminescent bacteria with a pot plant , allowing bioengineers to create the plant , which can be used as a lamp ( pictured ) ‘ after the initial glow of the plant is visible , the plant ’s features and glowing parts become increasingly more prominent as the eyes continue to adjust , ’ the company explained			1
it took dr @entity92 , bioengineer and the founder of @entity30 , several years to make the plant prototypes , which for the first time show that plants can emit light on their own			2
the findings of his research were first described in the journal @entity101 in 2010 but it was not until december of last year that he announced the first commercially available glowing plant , named @entity7			0
scientists have been trying to create light - emitting plants for around 30 years , but @entity30 ’s creation is not painted with dye and does not rely on ultraviolet light to trigger a temporary glowing effect like previous innovations			1
‘ @entity30 ’s plants are the first autonomously luminescent , or autoluminescent , plants that emit light on their own without the need for chemicals or uv light , ’ the company claims on its website			2

here the plant is pictured in sunlight ' @entity30 's plants are the first autonomously luminescent , or autoluminescent , plants that emit light on their own without the need for chemicals or uv light , ' the company claims on its website it aims to bring cleaner , sustainable and affordable plant - based light alternatives to the world			2
the plants being auctioned will be shipped in transparent boxes containing nutrient - rich gel and will grow until they fill it up , when they can be transferred to a normal plant pot. while the plant glows in its box , the company said it improves with transfer to pots due to more open access to atmospheric oxygen .			0

@entity7 claims to be the first light - emitting plant and was made by bioengineers at @entity30 , @entity28 , @entity29
