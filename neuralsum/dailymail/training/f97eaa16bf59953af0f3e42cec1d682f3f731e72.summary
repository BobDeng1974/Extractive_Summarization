by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 professed it would be a ‘ perfect day ’ if his horse @entity4 was to triumph in the @entity5 at @entity6 on thursday afternoon and @entity8 ’s young stallions followed up by beating @entity9 in @entity10			1
but @entity1 has more faith in @entity4 doing the business than @entity8 reaching the latter stages of the tournament			1
‘ i think @entity4 is more likely to win than @entity8 are to reach the semi-finals , ’ said @entity1 , ‘ @entity8 ’s group is very hard , it ’s toss of a coin to get out of the group			1
if they do then maybe the quarters but then it ’s a potential meeting with @entity22 or @entity10 - and they ’ll have too much			2
’ @entity5 contender : @entity1 's pride and joy @entity4 is gunning for @entity5 glory at @entity6 on thursday top team : @entity1 with @entity28 , his trainer at @entity29 @entity1 is sending the strongest team yet from @entity29 to @entity6 this week and his beloved six - year - old @entity4 , trained by @entity28 , is the headline act			1
‘ we always saw him as a long term project , we did n’t over race him as a baby and now he ’s doing exactly what should be in many ways			2
his two races this season have been exceptional			2
he ’s in as good a form as ever and has a good chance but i keep telling myself to have a horse running in a race like this is staggering			2
even if he tailed off last , he ’s still the best horse i ’m ever likely to own , he ’s the apple of my eye			2
’ @entity1 began to plan for @entity29 in his mid- 20 ’s , knowing he would require something to occupy his time after his football career had finished			1
it has now grown to 95 horses			2
@entity8 will need a big performance from the likes of @entity55 on thursday night must win : @entity56 knows thursday 's game is now huge after saturday 's defeat against @entity59 ‘ i see too many people finishing football then considering what next and it ’s a bit too late by then , ’ he said , ‘ i ’ve got a few businesses			1
horse racing is only 10 % of my life			2
the main focus of my life is still football , commentating and running a management company for young footballers			0
‘ in many ways nurturing horses is the same as nurturing footballers			0
i ’m interested in the mechanics of what makes someone fast , or able to run for longer or further			0
if i got injured it was always “ why ? how ? what happened to my body ? how do we piece it back together and make sure it ’s stronger so ca n’t happen again			0
” horses are mammals , their muscles work identically to humans			0
the only thing that ’s different is they cant speak			0
’ @entity1 sat on a horse for the first time last year under the instruction of his wife , @entity93			1
he compared the pressure on jockeys at @entity6 to the @entity8 football team in @entity10			1
‘ i think the pressure is all relative , ’ said @entity1 , ‘ @entity6 is their world cup so it ’s about how they handle it			1
the pressure in their mind will be as great as ever the same as for a footballer at the @entity106			0
“ but they can handle it because they know they can do it			0
put me on a first tee of a golf course with 100 people watching and i ’m petrified			0
ask me to stand in front of 10mil and kick a ball straight not nervous because i know i can do it			0
’ @entity1 welcomed @entity119 players @entity120 and @entity121 , who both have horses with @entity1 , into his hospitality box at @entity124 last month @entity125 winner : @entity1 ( centre ) and the @entity128 team after their colt won the @entity130 at @entity6 in 2011 @entity1 pleaded for @entity56 to be bold and play the youngsters in his squad so one of them might experience the same life changing tournament as he did in @entity136 in 1998			1
‘ i hope the likes of @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 get a big say in it because i think they can do well , ’ he said , ‘ i think our strength lies in some of these young unproven players that are quick , had good seasons , are not scarred from past failures and have self belief			0
i can only look back to how i felt going into a @entity106			0
instead of fearing who you play against as you do later on , it ’s totally the opposite as a kid			0
you ’re just thinking i ’m going to score , do n’t think about who you ’re playing against			0
’ national hero : @entity1 celebrates after scoring against @entity155 in the @entity156 @entity29 stables in @entity159 , @entity160 , has recently taken on two of sir @entity163 ’s horses , one of which , @entity157 , is heading to @entity6			1
things did n’t turn out so well for @entity166 , the horse owned by @entity120 and trained at @entity1 ’s yard			1
‘ he did n’t make the grade so is n’t in training any more , ’ said @entity1 , ‘ let ’s just say he was n’t as talented as his owner			1
’ @entity1 is an ambassador for the @entity174 , which continues at @entity6 17 – 21 june			1

@entity1 's stable star @entity179 goes for @entity5 glory at @entity6
@entity183 *pundit* hoping the @entity8 can beat @entity9 the same evening
former @entity8 *striker* has more faith in the @entity4 than the national side
