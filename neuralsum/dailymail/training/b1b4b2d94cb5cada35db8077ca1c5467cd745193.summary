by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson when former @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 coach @entity2 begins work as the new coach at the @entity8 this week he will begin the biggest overhaul of the team since his pal @entity11 took charge in 2008			1
established key names could leave @entity3 and they will need replacing			1
@entity14 looks at exactly who will be ‘ incoming ’ and ‘ outgoing ’ as the revolving door at the @entity8 begins to spin			1
the 22 - year - old keeper signed from @entity24 should arrive this week			1
out @entity25 will join @entity26			1
he leaves as @entity3 ’s most decorated goalkeeper			2
@entity28 will cease to be the reserve keeper			1
@entity31 ’s great pal has shown in the run - in that he no longer has what it takes to fill @entity36 goal in times of emergency			2
on their way : goalkeepers @entity25 and @entity28 will leave the club this summer in a no 2 will be brought in			1
@entity45 ’s @entity44 , @entity47 ’s @entity46 , @entity49 ’s @entity48 and @entity51 ’s @entity50 are all candidates , although the latter might end up at @entity54 if , as expected , they lose @entity55			2
practically signed , sealed and delivered to @entity57 , meaning it ’s the end of an era for arguably @entity3 ’s greatest ever right back			2
on his way : @entity56 is not expected to be at @entity36 next season calling it quits : @entity60 retired at the end of the season and will be a big loss in trying to replace the irreplaceable one will be a tough job			1
@entity68 has the hair for it			1
he also has the chaotic , occasionally calamitous style that @entity60 showed earlier in his career			1
in even if @entity68 signs , @entity3 will still look to further strengthen their weakest area			1
@entity76 ’s @entity75 and @entity78 ’s @entity77 will be leading candidates			2
@entity81 ( of the question ) @entity80 and @entity83 are also on @entity36 ’s wishlist but both look like staying right where they are ( @entity87 and @entity88 respectively )			0
the @entity89 : @entity68 has been a long term target for @entity3 and could step in for @entity60 out @entity91 was sold to @entity3 fans as someone who could play in the centre of defence or in midfield			1
the former was plainly never true and he has never been given the chance to demonstrate the latter			0
will be sold if a buyer can be found			0
in @entity36 want another midfielder and some have put @entity103 on their wanted list			0
hard to think why @entity105 would sell			0
@entity106 is another target but new @entity109 manager @entity108 might have other ideas			0
one in , one out : @entity103 could come in at @entity36 and @entity91 could be heading for the exit @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114			1
none of them will leave for so much as a euro less than @entity3 want , and it ’s clear they wo n’t all leave			2
but for @entity36 to bring in as many players as they want to it ’s clear they will have to sell big too and these three all have suitors with cash to spend			2
@entity114 the most likely of the three to eventually move on			1
out @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 will also be show the door to make way from returning loanees			0
in @entity132 will return to play for his former @entity3 team boss			0
@entity134 could sign one of the above to fill the gap or take 18 - year - old @entity138 on loan			0
on the move ? @entity141 could be heading for the exit at @entity36 and could return to the @entity143 return : @entity132 looks set to head back to @entity144 after a loan spell at @entity134 in it used to be that @entity147 worked so well that there was no need for a @entity150 but @entity36 now see the need for a big centre forward who can offer solutions when all else fails			1
@entity156 has been discussed although , as with @entity103 , why would @entity105 sell ? @entity157 and @entity158			0
such is the huge respect for these two players they will only go if they decide to			0
neither can be assured a first - team place in the new @entity3 and so if @entity157 is tempted by an @entity164 adventure and @entity158 fancies a @entity166 or @entity143 swansong , they will be allowed to move on			0
@entity167 faces : @entity31 signed his new contract with club president @entity169 and after all that in and out , there will also be some of the proverbial			0
shake it all about for @entity31			0
after the announcement of a new £ 16.3m - a - season contract on friday he could yet dash off to @entity176 for @entity178 preparations without actually signing it , such is doom and gloom that now surrounds the four - times @entity183 winner			0
@entity2 ’s first job when he starts work on july 7 will be to get @entity3 ’s talisman back in the groove .			0
