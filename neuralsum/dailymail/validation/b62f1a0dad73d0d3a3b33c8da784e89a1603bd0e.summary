@entity0 is facing an uncertain future after being put up for sale for £ 4.8million			1
the historic attraction is one of three piers which have been put on the market by owners @entity8 for a collective asking price of £ 12.6million			1
@entity11 - home to the famous 33 metre high ( 108ft ) @entity12 and the closest of three piers to @entity14 - @entity13 and @entity15 in @entity16 , were all constructed in the 19th century			1
@entity19 , which stands at 341 metres long ( 1,118ft ) , and @entity13 , which is 150 metres long ( 492ft ) , do not benefit from listed status , despite opening in 1864 and 1892 respectively			1
but @entity28 , a director at @entity29 , who are selling the piers for @entity8 , said it would be very unlikely that a new owner would make significant changes			2
he said : ' in order to sustain their value and ensure that value appreciated , they would not change dramatically under new ownership			0
' in our opinion , the value is in the existing use and this is unlikely to change at either of the @entity14 piers			0
' the @entity46 piers , which were constructed using cast iron piles , steel frames and wooden decking , all boast amusement arcades and rides and generate a collective income of around £ 1.6 million a year for @entity8 through annual concession agreements			2
grade two listed : @entity15 is also on sale - and altogether they can be bought for £ 12.6million st @entity58 , director at @entity8 - which also owns @entity60 - said the group was selling three of the four piers as it was ' restructuring its assets '			1
he said : ' these assets are jewels in the crown of the @entity69 's coastline and we are delighted to offer them to the market either as separate lots or collectively			0
' mr @entity28 added : ' each of these piers are truly iconic structures , having been popular visitor attractions in two of the @entity69 's best known resorts for over a century			2
' each pier is being offered for sale freehold , subject to the various concession agreements in place			0
' as profitable attractions , we 're confident this sale will attract major interest			0
' a spokesman for the @entity90 , which promotes the preservation and continued enjoyment of seaside piers in the @entity69 , said : ' these piers are all in good order and trading successfully , and , given that @entity97 is almost upon us , i have no doubt that they will quickly find a buyer or buyers			0
