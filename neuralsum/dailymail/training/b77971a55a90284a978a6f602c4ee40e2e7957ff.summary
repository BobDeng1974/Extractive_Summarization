ayatollah @entity0 blames the @entity1 and ' wicked ' @entity2 for creating the @entity3 which has seized control of a swathe of @entity6 and @entity7 @entity9 's supreme leader has blamed the @entity1 and ' wicked ' @entity2 for creating the @entity11 terror group which has seized control of a swathe of @entity6 and @entity7			1
ayatollah @entity0 's sharp remarks , in his first speech since prostate surgery last month , were a reminder of @entity9 suspicions of the west despite the rise of a common foe			1
' @entity1 , @entity22 , and especially the veteran expert of spreading divisions , the wicked government of @entity2 , have sharply increased their efforts of creating divisions between the @entity27 and @entity28 , ' he said			0
@entity11 , known to its detractors by its @entity31 acronym @entity32 , has overrun swathes of war - torn @entity7 and @entity6 in recent months			1
despite being adversaries for decades , @entity28 power @entity9 and the @entity1 both oppose the militants and have armed local groups fighting them			2
senior officials from both countries have denied any plans to work together , however			0
' they created @entity43 and @entity32 in order to create divisions and to fight against the @entity46 , but today , they have turned on them ( @entity11 ) , ' @entity0 said			1
the @entity1 along with several @entity27 monarchies began a campaign of air strikes against @entity11 militants in @entity7 on september 23			1
other @entity53 countries , including @entity2 , have also taken part in bombing raids against @entity11 positions in @entity6			2
@entity0 's accusation appeared to be reference to @entity53 support for the rebel forces fighting @entity62 's close ally , @entity7 president @entity61			1
@entity63 have emerged as the rebels ' strongest military element			0
there are persistent rumours that many rebels trained and armed by the @entity69 have gone on to join @entity32			2
a recent survey of armaments used by @entity32 found the @entity1 was the third biggest source , after @entity73 and @entity74			1
@entity75 worked alongside @entity77 forces to study small - calibre ammunition recovered from jihadi forces			0
@entity9 also believes the @entity1 and @entity2 are using the @entity81 threat to justify their renewed presence in the region			0
' a careful and analytic look at the developments reveals that the @entity1 and its allies , in efforts that are falsely termed countering @entity89 , seek to create division and enmity among the @entity92 rather to destroy the root causes of that ( terrorist ) current , ' @entity0 said			2
' shi'ites and @entity27 must know that any action or remark , including insulting one another , leads to increased sensitivities and ignite flames			0
this will certainly benefit the common enemy of all @entity92			0
' @entity11 fighters fighting @entity77 forces in @entity105 : despite being adversaries for decades , @entity28 power @entity9 and the @entity1 both oppose the militants and have armed local groups fighting them @entity0 's criticism was a counterpoint to an apparent thaw in @entity2 - @entity9 relations when president @entity115 met @entity2 prime minister @entity116 in @entity117 in september - a move that was criticised by hardliners at home			1
that meeting followed decades of strained relations which worsened when @entity2 closed its embassy in @entity62 after hardliners stormed it in november 2011			0
@entity2 decided in june this year to reopen the facility , but the embassy has yet to open its doors .			0

ayatollah @entity0 says @entity32 is part of a divide and conquer *strategy*
