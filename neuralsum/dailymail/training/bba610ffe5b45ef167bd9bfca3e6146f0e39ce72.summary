@entity0 begin the defence of their @entity3 title against @entity4 in a qualifier on tuesday evening but a crucial selection dilemma faces head coach @entity7 ahead of the tie			2
who should @entity7 start as no 1 - @entity11 veteran @entity10 , or @entity13 stopper @entity12 ? it seems peculiar to think that @entity10 ' position in goal is under threat , yet the voices calling for the 33 - year - old to be replaced are growing in both number and volume			1
@entity25 , on the other hand , has been capped just twice for his country and playing just 97 minutes in the process			0
if the choice was to be measured on just experience and pedigree alone , there is no comparison - yet when form , age and ability are introduced , it becomes a far closer contest			0
whereas @entity10 crumbled under the pressure during the @entity39 - including putting in a calamitous showing against @entity57 in @entity0 's 5 - 1 group stage loss - and has failed to nail down the no 1 jersey at @entity11 , @entity25 has been one of the bright sparks in @entity62 's otherwise disastrous reign at @entity63 to date			1
the 23 - year - old struggled during his first season in the @entity66 but , in the three campaigns since , he has become one of the finest ' keepers in the league - assured under the high ball , cool in one - on - one situations and superb as a shot - stopper			2
save : @entity25 ( right ) makes a save from @entity75 during @entity0 's 2 - 0 friendly loss to @entity77 last week glory : @entity10 ( back centre ) has lifted an unprecedented three major trophies as @entity0 captain nightmare : @entity10 endured a torrid @entity39 campaign , including a disastrous display against @entity57 @entity25 was between the sticks for @entity0 's 2 - 0 loss to @entity77 last week and made some crucial saves to keep the score respectable			1
the feeling around the country is that @entity7 may part with the old - @entity91 and @entity92 have already retired - and try and blood in a new generation of players , including at goalkeeper			0
@entity97 dropped @entity10 two years ago and , although many thought it was merely a trademark @entity100 - style move designed to cement his authority , the goalkeeper has not recovered since			0
his position as @entity11 's first choice has not been assured throughout the whole of @entity107 's reign at the club , but he has been an ever - present in the @entity0 line - up during that time			2
if rumours are to be believed , however , then @entity10 may no longer be no 1 for club or country			0
step forward @entity12 ... thinking time : @entity25 could make his competitive debut for @entity0 against @entity4 on tuesday night dive : @entity25 has been in splendid form for @entity13 over the last couple of seasons			1

@entity10 ' starting place with @entity0 is under threat from @entity12
@entity0 boss @entity7 must choose between @entity125 stoppers
@entity25 played full *90* minutes in 2 - 0 friendly loss to @entity77 last week
@entity0 host @entity4 in @entity130 on tuesday
@entity11 stopper @entity10 has @entity125 record 156 caps to @entity25 's two
the 33 - year - old skippered @entity0 to three *consecutive* major trophies
@entity13 goalkeeper @entity25 is on form and is only 23 years old
