@entity0 missed two golden chances as @entity3 champions @entity2 started the defence of their campaign with a whimper against @entity8			1
missing suspended manager @entity9 , @entity2 looked toothless without @entity10 , even against the leakiest defence in last season ’s competition , and the @entity14 could not step up to fill the gap			1
at a rowdy , intimate @entity17 , the favourites looked tired after their @entity19 exertions on friday against @entity20 and lacked incision , showing why they have been linked with playmakers like @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 this summer			2
scroll down to watch @entity2 manager @entity9 sent off in @entity19 failed to fire : summer signing @entity0 missed two golden opportunities to score for @entity2 banished : @entity2 manager @entity9 has been banned from the touchline for eight matches @entity8 : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 55 ) , @entity44			1

subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69			0
booked : @entity59 , @entity53 referee : @entity71 att : 11,070 despite winning the title , @entity2 still contrived to end last season — an incredible , unforgettable one for @entity75 supporters — in disappointment			1
the @entity78 final defeat by arch - rivals @entity20 was so ‘ @entity2 ’ in its nature it was almost fitting — so , so close , but yet so far			1
a constant theme throughout the club ’s history			0
asked whether the club would be giving up their game - by - game stance to the season , which @entity9 insisted the club were adhering to last year , the response was negative			1
he still sees his team as the underdogs to the league ’s giants , @entity90 and @entity20 , and wants them to take each task as it comes , forgetting about arcing grand - plans of lifting titles or competing in @entity95			2
@entity9 was banned for this match , having been given five managerial yellow cards last season			1
deadlock : @entity8 deserved their point as the reigning @entity3 champions started their season slowly we wo n’t be seeing him on the touchline for a while longer , after he was hit with an additional eight - game punishment for his unruly behaviour against @entity20 in the @entity19 last week			1
but the team have been well drilled by the @entity107 and stuck to their roles under the watchful eye of the hulking @entity110			0
if officials thought they had got out of the frying pan , they are firmly in the fire now , because the assistant coach has a capacity to go berserk that is even easier to trigger than @entity9 ’s			2
@entity2 have been somewhat deconstructed over the summer , with @entity118 recalling @entity119 and signing @entity120 and @entity10			2
@entity121 was another who left , leaving the club working hard to plug the holes			0
on paper , the likes of @entity60 and @entity0 should be able to make a decent fist of the challenge , but they struggled against @entity8			2
having seen @entity90 and @entity20 win their opening matches , the task for @entity2 against @entity20 rivals @entity8 was clear			1
last season @entity9 ’s side won the title with 90 points			1
given the millions the ‘ big two ’ have spent on reinforcements , the total could be closer to 100 this time around			0
the spirit and resilience from last season was still evident , with captain @entity58 taking an almost ludicrously high boot from @entity39 to his face in the opening few minutes and @entity55 and @entity54 taking no nonsense at the back			0
tough night : @entity2 were far from the form that saw them beat @entity20 to the @entity146 chances were at a premium at the start of the match , with @entity60 being denied by @entity33 when the goalkeeper was quick off his line to intercept a through - ball			1
at the other end @entity118 ’s on - loan youngster @entity44 was finding getting the better of right - back @entity53 to be hard work , just like his parent side did last season in the @entity78			0
in the 25th minute @entity2 put together a brilliant move , with @entity60 flicking the ball into the path of @entity56 , galloping up the field from left - back			2
his low ball was met at the far post by @entity0 , but the former @entity166 man could only find the side - netting			2
he had another brilliant opportunity moments later when @entity8 centre - back @entity35 needlessly gave the ball away on the edge of his own box			0
@entity62 played it into the path of @entity0 but the forward ’s low strike was well saved by @entity33			0
on the occasions @entity8 got forward , @entity2 defended in numbers to keep them at bay , with @entity119 ’ replacement @entity52 being well shielded by his backline , leaving him without a save to make in the first half			0
toothless : without manager @entity9 on the touchline , @entity2 lacked their usual spirit and desire with @entity2 struggling to win the midfield battle they took off @entity62 and brought on youngster @entity63 , who spent last season on loan maturing under @entity194 at @entity8			1
it did nothing to help , with @entity8 beginning to dominate the game			0
@entity44 began to have more of an influence and former @entity198 forward @entity43 forced a good save from @entity52 with a firm header after the electric @entity41 whipped it in from the right			0
although the striker was an abject failure at @entity203 , he caused @entity2 more than a few problems after entering the fray as a substitute			2
by the end of the game it was the home side that looked far likelier to break the deadlock and @entity2 will consider themselves lucky to have escaped with a point			0
with @entity9 unable to conduct affairs from the sidelines and instead stuck up near the press box , the players would not have been looking forward to their intense manager finally getting to let off some steam on the short coach - ride home .			1
