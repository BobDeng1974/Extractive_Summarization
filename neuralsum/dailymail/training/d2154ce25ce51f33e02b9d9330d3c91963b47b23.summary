the 96th @entity0 will either conclude on sunday with @entity1 leaving his latest mark on the road to greatness or a shootout for the ages			1
either way cancel any plans to go out , because this is going to be a fitting conclusion to a classy season in the four majors			0
has there been a more exciting day in the game this year than saturday ’s third round ? played at a @entity18 venue , it generated @entity18 levels of hysteria as fearless wannabes , evergreen veterans and unsung @entity23 took turns alongside the man of the moment to produce shots of stunning quality			1
for the final two hours of play the noise was unbelievable as roars echoed all over the property			0
fist - pump : a strong back - nine allowed @entity1 to stay in control heading into the final round at @entity36 up - and - down display : @entity1 rolls his eyes as he leaves his tee shot on the eighth hole just short of the green in trouble : the 25 - year - old looks into the creek for his tee shot on the second hold during his third round patient : @entity1 waits for his caddie as he gets ready to his his ball after losing his drive off the fourth tee scrambling : the @entity53 comes out of the crowd after hitting up to the fourth green upping his game : @entity1 picked up shots on the back nine with birdies at the 10th , 15th and 16th holes perhaps inevitably , given how the last month has gone , it was @entity62 who had the final word to seize a narrow advantage			1
at one point there were an incredible ten players either tied or within one shot of the lead			1
then @entity1 rolled in a 20 footer to birdie the 15th			1
at the near 500 yard par four 16th he pummelled a drive 340 yards and his nine iron finished 18 inches from the flag			1
he birdied the 18th from the sand as well for his third gain in four holes to regain top spot			2
it was truly mesmerising to watch			0
just as compelling was the pairing of @entity81 and @entity82			1
@entity81 birdied four of his last five holes to give himself a shot at his sixth major on sunday but he was still outscored by two shots by the 28 year old @entity87 , who shot 65 to the 67 from the player he grew up idolising			1
‘ it was just a dream come true today , ’ said @entity82			2
so @entity1 will go into the final round with a one shot lead over @entity82 on 13 under after a 67			1
he will not only be trying to win back - to - back majors but complete his third win in a row , after a stupendous run of play that has seen him complete his last 11 rounds in an aggregate of 45 under par , with just one round in the seventies			1
distraught : @entity1 reacts to a missed putt for birdie at the picturesque 13th hole picture perfect : @entity1 hits an impressive shot on the sixth hole at @entity36 @entity110 , the man who chased him so hard at @entity111 at @entity112 last month , is just two back			1
then comes the popular @entity81 and @entity114 , with quite a cast on nine under including two @entity116 in @entity117 from @entity118 and @entity119 from @entity120			0
given @entity36 ’s place in @entity124 , they ’d be appropriate champions , would n’t they ? on seven under par , six shots back are two former world number ones in @entity128 and @entity129 , and they will probably need to break the major championship scoring record of 63 to win			1
after yesterday ’s play , you would n’t rule out someone shooting such a score			0
@entity1 said he knew hearing all the roars that he needed to do something down the stretch			2
‘ there was a lot of noise out there and it was n’t being generated by me , so the birdies at the 15th and the 16th were huge , ’ he said			2
‘ it means i am still in control of the golf tournament but clearly i am going to have to play really well and shoot a low number in the final round			2
but i ’m loving it			0
this is why we play the game and practice all these hours on the range			0
' it has its stresses but i would n’t want to be anywhere else			0
you ’ve got to enjoy being in the lead because that ’s what it is all about			2
’ swing low : he drives his tee shot down the fairway on the 10th hole during his third round going for a walk : @entity1 makes his way to the ninth tee with his caddie @entity170 @entity1 and @entity114 certainly had their fair share of adventures in the final group			1
the 25 year old @entity53 and the 26 year old @entity175 are known for their penchant for spectacular rounds laced with birdies and eagles			1
but it was a par that each of them made in turn early on that fairly took the breath away			2
first up was day , whose jumpiness over the opening holes was personified with a horrendous hook off the second tee			2
it led to him taking off his socks and shoes , rolling up his trousers , wading through a creek and back – but still walking off the green with a par. not to be outdone , @entity1 came up with one of his own at the par four 4th			1
the tee had been moved up on this hole to make it driveable , and @entity1 duly took dead aim			2
he was soon dropping his club in disgust , however , as the ball sailed miles left and dropped into a creek			0
after taking a penalty drop , it left him with a difficult pitch back , which he played well to 12ft			0
now he was looking at a par putt that , had he missed , would have meant he was giving up at least two shots to the field and three shots to some			0
but his solid putting , a feature of his brilliant run of form this summer , came to prominence once more , and he was pumping his fist as the ball disappeared			0
as both players had proved , sometimes pars are every bit as pivotal as birdies			0
@entity1 notched his first birdie of the day at the next , and was a ball - width from making it two in a row at the difficult 6th , as his try from 25ft stopped on the edge			1
he duly made one on the next hole to establish a two shot lead			1
the tone for the afternoon was set			0
chatting : @entity114 of @entity175 and @entity1 chat as they walk to the seventh green in @entity241 nice approach : @entity1 chips on to the green at the eighth hole of the @entity245 almost inevitably a good bit of the excitement was being generated by the irrepressible @entity110 , the bright spark in this dark season for @entity251 golf			1
tied fifth at the masters , tied runner - up at the @entity253 and @entity111 , he has given himself another realistic shot at winning his first major with a fine round of 67			1
then there was @entity259 @entity258 , whose 66 was one of the most admirable rounds of all			0
after looking a certainty all year to make his @entity18 debut at @entity265 next month , the 38 year old @entity259 arrived here having dropping into the 9th and precarious last spot in the automatic standings			0
with the likes of @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity129 all looking for one of the three wild cards at present , the pressure was clearly on			0
how well @entity258 has responded and how much he deserves to make it			0
@entity258 told @entity275 last week : ’ no matter how much you try to forget about it , the @entity18 is always at the back of your mind tormenting you			0
’ now lieing in the top ten in this big - money event on eight under , he can remove all the torment with a good final round today			1
‘ all i could do this week was go out and take control of my own destiny , and i certainly built towards that with this round , ’ he said			0
‘ this was about perfect			0
’ with overnight rain and no wind rendering the course defenceless , there was a chance for the early starters to post a low score and make a statement			0
emerging @entity300 @entity299 and scot @entity301 both shot 66 and @entity302 a 67 , and all of them will have the chance to post a top ten on sunday			1
relief : the 25 - year - old reacts after saving par on the tricky 11th hole at @entity310			2

@entity53 finished third round at 13 - under par for the tournament
@entity1 fired a round of 67 at @entity36 on day 3 of @entity245
he keeps his one - shot lead at the top despite an up - and - down display
@entity82 is just one behind after finishing with three birdies
