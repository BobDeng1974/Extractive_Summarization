@entity3 are 11th in the standings , some 26 points behind @entity12 's men but @entity1 will hope to mastermind an unexpected victory as he did against @entity14 earlier this month			1
@entity15 will serve the second of a two - game touchline ban following his sending off against @entity19 and so will watch from the stands			1
@entity7 will be without the suspended @entity21 , who was handed a two - match ban for an altercation in last weekend 's match in @entity25			1
they could hand a debut to 21 - year - old @entity28 midfielder @entity27 , who joined this week from @entity29 for Â£ 9.7m			1
join @entity30 from 2pm for live coverage with updates from @entity33 in @entity7			2

@entity38 are in action against @entity40 later , as they try to match title rivals @entity7 's score and @entity14 play @entity19 tomorrow			1
that is all from me today , thanks for joining			0
not an enjoyable day for @entity1			2
his side took the lead in the first minute through @entity47 but they could only hold on for two minutes before @entity48 made things level			0
@entity12 's side powered on from there and were denied several times by @entity53 before @entity54 put real 2 - 1 up			1
a double from @entity56 in the second half , including an absolutely astonishing second , pulled @entity7 further out of sight and had it not been for @entity53 , things could have got very humiliating for @entity1			1
@entity7 4 - 1 @entity3 @entity53 blocks @entity61 from point blank range , another great save ! not long left here at all for @entity3 to endure			1
no hat - trick for @entity56 today as @entity61 replaces him for the final moments of the game			2
@entity66 is also withdrawn and @entity67 takes his place			0
he may have conceded four this afternoon but @entity53 has kept the score down from @entity7 's ruthless attack			2
he is one of the few players @entity1 will be pleased with today			2
how is it not five ? @entity73 is denied by @entity53 after racing clear of the @entity3 defence and while it is another great save from the goalkeeper , you would expect @entity73 to hit the back of the net with the amount of time he had			2
it started so well for @entity1 , but the game has proved to be as miserable as the weather in @entity7 today			1
he has not been able to repeat his @entity14 heroics and the @entity85 will want to forget today as quickly as possible			0
76 - @entity56 gets his second of the match and it is the best goal of the game by far ! the @entity90 striker has been superb for @entity12 's side and he gets his second in stunning style			1
he plays the ball into @entity95 , who returns it to him on the edge of the area before lashing an astonishing strike across goal that bends up into the top corner			0
@entity53 does not have a chance with that , incredible strike ! @entity7 4 - 1 @entity3 @entity56 @entity48 , scorer of @entity7 's first goal , is done for the afternoon			1
he leaves the field to a rapturous reception from the @entity7 supporters and @entity110 replaces him			2
@entity111 joins @entity112 in the book for @entity7 , after putting in a rather brutal challenge on @entity115			2
@entity7 now seem to have taken their foot off the gas , but the damage has been done to @entity3			1
there is around 20 minutes left			0
it 's 3 - 1 @entity7 , who have been in ferocious form from the moment they fell behind to @entity3			1
here 's a picture of @entity56 celebrating with @entity73 , who provided the assist for his strike , their side 's third goal of the game			2
@entity1 uses his final change , with goalscorer @entity47 being taken off and @entity133 , a defensive midfielder , coming on			2
it looks like it might be a case of damage limitation for @entity3			0
@entity7 pressing forward relentlessly now and @entity56 almost had a second and @entity7 's fourth			2
@entity73 slid the ball across the penalty area from the left and it needed a touch from @entity141 to direct the ball away from the attacker			0
meanwhile , here is a shot of @entity54 celebrating after putting @entity7 2 - 1 ahead			2
it is hard to believe that they were ever trailing this game , even if it was for only two minutes			0
it 's a sublime goal from @entity7 , who instantly undo any defensive reassurance that @entity1 ' decision to swap @entity153 for @entity154 may have brought			1
the @entity90 striker exchanges passes with @entity73 on his way into the penalty area before slotting cooly past @entity53			0
3 - 1 , and it has been coming			0
@entity7 3 - 1 @entity3 @entity56 it is an interesting swap from @entity1			1
@entity153 has the potential to provide @entity7 with some concern with his attacking forays but he has been hooked in favour of a defender , who @entity1 will no doubt hope can offer some reassurance in their own third of the pitch			1
@entity1 has made a second change of the match , taking off @entity153 and replacing him with @entity172 , a left - back			1
but a powerful header from @entity48 levelled the scores after three minutes			0
@entity54 put the hosts ahead on 36 but @entity111 has been the key player for @entity7 , carving @entity1 ' side open with ease			1
if they stop him , they may have a chance of getting back into the game			0
@entity3 's players celebrate going ahead against @entity7 in the first minute at the @entity4			1
@entity73 sent a free kick over the bar after @entity56 was chopped down by @entity184			0
at half - time , the score is 2 - 1 but @entity33 , @entity187 's man in @entity7 , says ' @entity3 will do well to have kept this at 2 - 1			1
' it all started so well for @entity1 , as his side went ahead in the first minute through @entity47 but @entity48 swiftly pegged them back before @entity54 put the @entity191 holders into the lead			0
it should be 3 - 1 ! how is it not 3 - 1 ? @entity73 has just found himself all alone , only @entity53 to beat with @entity48 and @entity56 either side of him and he has missed the target completely ! @entity1 is furious , absolutely furious			2
@entity73 is equally as embarrassed			0
@entity56 's initial chance came from another cross from @entity111 , who seems hell bent on causing the destruction of @entity3 today			2
his movement is clever , his passing accurate and incisive and @entity3 just ca n't contain him			0
36 - there is only so much @entity53 can keep out			0
he does exceptionally well to block @entity56 's initial shot but the rebound falls to @entity54			0
the defender does n't need a second invitation and stabs the ball home			0
finally , @entity7 have the lead			0
@entity7 2 - 1 @entity3 @entity54 @entity112 has the first yellow card of the game for a late challenge on @entity214 after 31 minutes			1
@entity48 is now denied by @entity53 , who beats away a fearsome strike from the @entity217 international			0
@entity7 come again , but @entity56 's header is very high and @entity53 watches the ball sail over the bar			2
this is a tough test of @entity3 's defensive credentials			2
this is an ominous sign for @entity3 and @entity1			1
@entity73 has 11 goals in 11 games for @entity7 when @entity21 has not been in the side			1
in an end - to - end opening 10 minutes , @entity73 's involvement was minimal but he has just forced a corner after his fierce shot was deflected out of play , and @entity3 eventually scramble the ball away			1
@entity53 to the rescue for @entity3 and it is @entity111 who is again the creator			0
he threads an enticing ball through @entity3 's defence and into the path of @entity56 , who has his chance smothered by the onrushing goalkeeper			2
@entity7 are growing into this now			0
that substitution is not something @entity1 would have wanted to have done so early in the game and he will hope it does not upset the organisation of his team			1
he has not lost in six encounters against @entity12 and he 'll be desperate to extend that run today			0
and it is @entity115 who replaces @entity251 after 17 minutes			0
not what @entity1 wants to see here			0
striker @entity251 hobbles off and @entity253 starts warming up			0
@entity7 are starting to look a little bit more comfortable after a frenetic opening 10 minutes			0
but @entity48 's strike has not deterred @entity257 , who could not get much closer to taking the lead again			0
@entity260 's shot from the edge of the area is weak and finds the path of @entity153 , who stick his foot out and diverts it narrowly wide of the post			0
the score remains 1 - 1 but if the game continues in this manner , it wo n't be for much longer			0
it was a tremendous header @entity48 , sending a cross from @entity111 into the roof of the net and leaving goalkeeper @entity53 with no chance			0
what a start here ! @entity1 was in dreamland ... but his joy lasts only two minutes as @entity48 swiftly levels for @entity7			1
three minutes gone and already there are two goals ! @entity7 1 - 1 @entity3 it has not taken @entity257 any time at all to stun the @entity4 ! one of the young players that @entity1 has pushed into the first team , @entity47 , gets the goal with a header from a corner ! @entity3 1 - 0 @entity7 @entity33 is at the game for @entity187 : two former @entity7 players in @entity3 's line - up and both @entity260 and @entity153 were given warm welcomes by club staff when they arrived at the stadium just over an hour ago			1
@entity73 starts for @entity7 - his record when he plays without @entity21 in the side is 11 goals in 11 games			1
@entity7 expects more of the same today			0
and here is how @entity3 will line - up at the @entity4 confirmation here of the @entity7 starting line - up hello and welcome to live coverage of today 's @entity6 clash between @entity7 and @entity3			1
@entity7 are without @entity21 today , as he serves the first game of his two match ban for a red card last weekend			1
as for @entity3 , @entity1 has sent shockwaves through the @entity308 league once already by beating @entity14			1
