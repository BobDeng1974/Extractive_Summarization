beat neighbour : @entity8 ( pictured ) , a former councillor , hit pensioner @entity10 three times with his crutch after he fell to the ground , the court heard deputy district judge @entity27 told @entity8 , an ex-liberal @entity8 councillor , that if he had been a younger man or had a record of violence , he would have been given a jail sentence			1
@entity31 heard that @entity8 told police that mr @entity10 had approached him from behind and tapped him , which led him to believe that he was being attacked in october last year			1
judge @entity27 said : ‘ you did n't see who it was , but instinctively you struck behind you with your crutch			0
‘ when you turned , mr @entity10 was there and you accept you tried to take hold of him and he fell to the floor and then you accept that you struck mr @entity10 three times with your crutch when he was on the floor			1
' imprison you at home ' : the judge told @entity8 that if he was younger or had a history of violence , he would have got a jail term , instead he was handed a curfew ‘ there was something which provoked you to behave this way			1
however , an elderly man on the floor being hit with an implement is very serious			0
‘ if you were a young man or had a record of any violence then this would be a case of custody , but i am going to imprison you at home and deal with you in the community			0
’ @entity8 , who walked into court with the aid of two crutches , confirmed this version of events by simply saying : ‘ @entity65			0
’ @entity8 pleaded guilty and was handed a curfew order			2
the judge added that @entity8 's account was not ‘ materially different ’ from that of his victim and that she needed to hear no further evidence before passing sentence on one charge of assault by beating			2

it might be that a curfew is appropriate			0

asked by the judge whether he had anything to say for himself , @entity8 accepted that he could have handled his confrontation with mr @entity10 without violence			1
@entity8 said : ‘ i would like to forget the whole issue and i can only apologise to the bench profusely			0
' despite what his neighbours said , @entity8 added : ‘ i am not an aggressive person and i can only apologise for the inconvenience that this has caused you this morning			0
i would adhere to a curfew , obviously			0
’ @entity101 squabble : @entity8 's confrontation with mr @entity10 is thought to have come about after an argument over the cutting of grass and washing of wheelie bins on the cul - de - sac road they live on ( pictured ) after consulting with probation service officers , the judge sentenced @entity8 to a four - month curfew confining him to his home between 7pm and 7am			1
