by @entity0 published : 15:04 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 15:04 est , 25 november 2013 his name might not be as recognizable as @entity5 or @entity6 , but according to @entity7 , @entity8 - based , @entity3 jeweler @entity1 is one of the world 's most influential gem artists			1
the @entity12 museum is celebrating @entity1 's @entity14 atelier with a retrospective - marking the institution 's first - ever show dedicated to a living , contemporary jeweler			1
@entity1 is famously reclusive and does not lend his designs for magazine shoots or red carpet appearances , however his jewelry is among some of the world 's most sought after auction pieces			1
floral advance : @entity1 is famous for his floral - inspired designs like the 2001 @entity27 ( @entity28 ) and the 2011 @entity29 ( r ) the @entity7 's @entity14 exhibit highlights the signatures of @entity1 ’s @entity14 gem atelier through the over 400 exemplary pieces of his work that are on display			1
raised in the @entity36 , @entity12 , the 70 - year - old designer is highly regarded for his pavé work – a technique that entails setting diminutive gems in even smaller settings to create a rolling surface of stones			1
more than just setting assorted gems , @entity1 uses pavés as a method for creating multidimensional objects			0
much like a painter , he uses various tones of colored stones to shade and highlight the figures he ’s setting , which typically take the shape of flowers and butterflies			0
@entity1 ’s creative instincts began in needlepoint – another craft in which he is an expert			0
he is one of very few jewelers to set his pieces in dark alloy metals , which he says exemplify the hues and shine of his colored gems			0
the jeweler is famously reclusive and has only exhibited his work once before , in @entity67			1
he produces somewhere between 100 and 120 one - of - a - kind pieces a year in the interest of artistry , rather than widespread commercial success			0
incredible auction success : while @entity1 does not advertise , his items are so coveted that they can fetch more than two times their original price at auction after graduating from @entity76 , @entity1 moved to @entity8 in 1966 and opened a needlepoint store in the @entity79 capital with his romantic partner @entity80			0
while his handiwork was sought after by design houses including @entity84 and @entity85 , it was n’t long before @entity1 ’s interest in jewelry rose to the forefront of his mind			2
after clients asked him to reset their finer pieces , @entity1 decided to reinvest his focus in jewelry and moved back to @entity12 in 1976 to work for @entity94			1
he quickly returned to @entity8 and opened @entity14 on the @entity95 in 1978 as an upstart venture , with just three rings made from less costly materials like moonstone and coral			0
less than ten years later , @entity1 moves his operations to a larger space in the famous @entity79 plaza where he continues to operate today , on an appointment - only basis			2
needlepoint start : the designer 's formative experience with needlepoint inspires his work like a 1994 @entity111 ( @entity28 ) and a 2008 @entity112 ( r ) @entity1 has been called the ‘ fabergé of our time , ’ by designer @entity113 and the ‘ single greatest jewelry of our time , ’ by former loyal client @entity117 , who purchased more than a dozen of his pieces while married to billionaire @entity120			1
the creator : @entity124 ( above ) is now 70 years old , but he says he has no intention of selling his company unlike other jewelry designs which depreciate in value after their original purchase , @entity1 ’s creations have been shown to typically double in value when auctioned			1
his investment - worthy proven objects have been favored by @entity133 and @entity134			0
@entity1 is famously finicky about who is allowed to buy his designs , and he is known to refuse purchase when he thinks an item is not befitting of its buyer			2
the designer is so particular in fact , that for the only other retrospective of his work to have ever been staged ( at @entity67 ’s @entity144 in 2002 ) , he required that the exhibition space remain nearly pitch black and for the museum to provide each visitor with a flashlight so they could discover their own favorite focal points			2
he also required that the space be scented with his signature @entity14 scents , which are only presently sold in two locations – a small store in @entity8 and at @entity155 in @entity12 for $ 472 per ounce			0
the @entity7 exhibit will run until march 9 , in the museum ’s @entity158 and @entity160 .			0

the exhibit marks the @entity7 's first retrospective of a living jewelry designer 's work
@entity14 's @entity1 is famously reclusive , and only creates around one - hundred of his renowned designs each year
