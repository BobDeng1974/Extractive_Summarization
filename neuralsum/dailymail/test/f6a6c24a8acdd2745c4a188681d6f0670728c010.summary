the baggage handler who caused an emergency landing when he woke up inside the cargo hold of an airborne flight has come forward for the first time to detail the frightening experience , but still wo n't explain how he fell asleep to begin with			1
@entity6 sat down with @entity7 for an interview , and says he was exhausted and dozed off while loading a plane at @entity10 on april 13 and woke up when a piece of luggage landed on his head			1
the airport worker , who appears to be in his early 20s according to @entity17 , would n't explain how he had the time to take a nap on the plane but says it used to be common practice : ' i mean when i first started the job , we took naps			1
above , a picture of @entity6 being rescued from the cargo hold after the plane was forced to turn around rude awakening : @entity6 woke up when a piece of luggage landed on him and then he called 911 - but his call cut out after just 44 seconds since it was pitch black inside the cargo hold , @entity6 was at first confused and disoriented but then quickly realized that the plane was moving			1
' in my mind , i said , " this is not happening			0
this is just a joke			0
" ' junior his first move was to call his company , @entity57 , which provides baggage services for airlines			2
but the person who answered the call at the office thought it was a prank call and just hung up			0
desperately , @entity6 next called 911 and struggled to communicate to the dispatcher his unusual and unlikely situation			0
' hello , i 'm trapped in this plane , ' @entity6 tells the operator in audio released of the 911 call			2
' you 're where ? ' the dispatcher asks			0
' i 'm inside a @entity72 feel like it 's moving in the air			0
can you please sent someone to stop it ? ' @entity6 says			0
unfortunately the phone call cut out after 44 seconds and then @entity6 was on his own			0
that 's when he started to lose hope , sending a text message to his mother saying he loved her , afraid he was going to die			2
last words : @entity6 says he was scared he was going to die , so he sent a text message to his mother , saying he loved her			2
the area @entity6 was trapped in was pressurized and temperature controlled , so his life was never threatened help me ! after his call to 911 cut out , @entity6 started banging on the ceiling of the cargo hold and passengers and crew heard , prompting the flight to turn around turn around : the pilot headed back to @entity10 after just 14 minutes in the air			1
@entity6 says he is sorry for the passengers whose flight to @entity105 he delayed luckily that was never the case since the cargo hold where @entity6 fell asleep is temperature controlled and pressurized , so he was never in danger of freezing or running out of oxygen			1
what saved @entity6 from being trapped on the flight for it 's two and a half hour journey to @entity105 was his decision to start banging on the roof of the cargo floor			2
' i was yelling , " help me , somebody â€™s down here , " ' he said			0
@entity6 's cries for help were so loud that passengers and crew members heard and the plane was turned around after just 14 minutes in the air			1
