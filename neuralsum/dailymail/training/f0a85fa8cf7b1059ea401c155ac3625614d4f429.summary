the @entity5 attached coded messages about @entity45 military movements to the birds which flew across the @entity8 with the precious intelligence			1
but one chilling note that has emerged after 70 years was written in @entity45 and informed the @entity49 the @entity5 recipient had been shot for spying having been found with a pigeon			0
a bird can be seen peeping out of a crate as it is carried by a member of an @entity33 bomber crew setting off on a mission over @entity5 self - releasing pigeon carrier : the cunning timing device developed to aid the plucky pigeon drop into occupied @entity27 by delaying the chute release until the birds were clear of the aircraft training : aircrews being trained by a @entity65 operative in the correct deployment of the birds a @entity69 operative loads a pigeon into a parachute cannister to be dropped over occupied @entity27 some 32 racing pigeons were awarded the prestigious @entity25 - the animal version of the @entity74 - for their acts of heroism in @entity77			1

its general manager , @entity79 , took them along to the @entity82 's @entity12 to show them off			0
he also revealed the stories behind their award as well some of the other madcap inventions made by @entity49 boffins and used to gather intelligence using the birds			0
these included a clockwork camera strapped to the belly of a pigeon that automatically took reconnaissance snaps of @entity95 - occupied @entity27 before returning home			1
of the five medals due to be featured on this sunday 's @entity12 , two were awarded to pigeons that delivered important intelligence from @entity27 six times between them			1
a plucky pigeon being released from in mid air above occupied @entity5 posters were put up across @entity49 warning the hungry populace not to shoot down the precious birds and ( right ) a @entity108 medal for gallantry awarded to the birds another , named ' @entity112 ' , brought back the first news of the disastrous landings at @entity115 in september 1942			1
most @entity33 planes took with them at least one carrier pigeon in the event of crashing behind enemy lines with no radio communication			0
a bird named , ' @entity122 ' , saved the crew of one downed plane by flying 288 miles in seven hours with an sos that led to the men being rescued			0
mr @entity79 said : ' thousands of racing pigeons were used by the @entity15 in the war and they saved lives and brought very important intelligence back from the @entity5 about the @entity45			1
' the @entity49 dreamed up all sorts of ways of getting them to the @entity21			0
' they strapped them in little parachutes so that they could n't fly off and dropped them out of the planes over a pre-arranged position			2
long haul hero : dickin medal winner ' @entity142 ' made an epic 480 mile trip from occupied @entity145 in july 1942 @entity146 : a piece of vital wartime intelligence that was brought back to @entity49 by one of the @entity150 ' then there were problems with pigeons flying into the tail planes of faster aircraft so the @entity49 put the pigeons inside little boxes with a cork screw fan and the friction of the wind wound the fan which opened the box allowing the pigeon to drop out			2
' anybody caught with a racing pigeon in @entity5 were considered to be spies and were court martialled and possibly executed			2
' the @entity45 had special teams called @entity170 units based along the coast which were snipers and their job was to try and shot @entity175 - bound pigeons out of the sky			0
' all the pigeons were interested in was getting home but they regularly had to fly through shot and fire to do that			0
some of the pigeons were even fitted with small cameras to bring back aerial photographs a @entity49 paratrooper equipped with pigeon in cannister prepares to jump into enemy territory ' they returned to their owners who then made contact with the military and passed on the coded messages			1
' the @entity194 was set up in the war and involved over 200,000 birds being given to the armed services			0
those that flew over @entity95 - occupied @entity27 were part of the @entity69			0
in 1943 @entity201 , founder of the @entity203 's @entity202 ( @entity204 ) set up the @entity25 to honour the bravery of animals in the war			2
