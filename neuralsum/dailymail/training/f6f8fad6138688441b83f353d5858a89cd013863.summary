by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 09:05 est , 26 september 2013 @entity2 secret services are probing whether exiled tycoon @entity3 is still alive after faking his death in @entity5 , according to an astonishing claim today			1
the staunch enemy of @entity8 is believed by @entity10 police to have committed suicide by hanging in a bathroom at an ex-wife 's home in @entity15 on march 23			1
at the time , there was speculation in @entity10 that he could have been killed in a hit by @entity2 secret services , and in @entity20 that @entity21 could have behind his demise			1
conspiracy theory : a @entity2 newspaper published these images of how oligarch @entity3 might look in disguise as secret services confirmed they are investigating claims he may still be alive recent reports in @entity2 have cited sceptics claiming that his death was staged - possibly by @entity10 secret services			1
and today a @entity20 tabloid newspaper claims both the @entity34 , the country 's domestic secret service , and the @entity37 , seen as equivalent of the @entity39 , are probing whether he is still alive			2
the paper also published bizarre artist 's impressions of what @entity3 might look like in disguise			0
' we are seriously considering a version that @entity3 did n't die , ' an anomymous special services source is quoted as saying by @entity49 , a leading @entity50 newspaper			1
' our staff have conducted certain investigations which gave us grounds to believe that he is alive			2
' enemies : @entity3 fled @entity2 soon after @entity8 was elected @entity57 president in 2000 , fearing arrest on charges he claimed were political there was no immediate official comment today from the @entity34 and @entity37			1
@entity3 , a scheming power behind the vodka throne of @entity64 , fled @entity2 soon after @entity8 was elected @entity57 president in 2000 , fearing arrest on charges he claimed were political			1
earlier @entity8 had been his protege			2
soon after @entity3 's death , @entity8 said that he had received appeals from the tycoon to be allowed to return to @entity2 , evidently admitting his errors in calling from @entity10 for the strongman to be toppled			1
' it was clear that @entity3 did n't act alone , but with a help of security service specialists			0
we are working on versions that @entity10 or @entity79 security services were involved in mocking it up , ' the source was quoted as saying in @entity49			2
@entity3 's corpse was reported to have been found by his bodyguard who smashed down a bathroom door			0
unanswered questions : a police @entity86 on the road leading to @entity3 's home , where his body was found in a bath on march 24			1
he is believed to have committed suicide the source echoes other recent @entity2 reports in saying that no photographs have emerged of his corpse , and that his coffin was sealed at his may 8 burial , contrary to normal @entity99 funerals			1
' there were cases when i organised ' deaths ' of people who were scared of revenge , and staged mock funerals , ' he said			0
' they were very similar to @entity3 's funeral , with a body in a closed casket , and with his close circle though dressed in mourning colours - in this case there were even mini-skirts - walking with smiles on their faces			0
' the colourful father of six was buried in @entity118 reportedly with two ex-wives and two long term mistresses present as well as a number of glamorous lovers			0
the report claimed that with his death , criminal cases against @entity3 ceased ' as there is no - one to prosecute , so his wealth will not be taken away '			0
in fact , however , the @entity2 government and others with claims against him are seeking compensation from his estate on what was left of the fortune of a mathematics professor turned business mogul who was his country 's first billionaire after the collapse of the @entity140			2
