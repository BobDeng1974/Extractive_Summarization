so it was unfortunate that the 140lbs mountain lion who made it all the way from @entity13 to @entity14 met a grisly end after being hit by a sports utility vehicle on a highway last month			1
the animal originated in the @entity21 region of @entity13 and was tracked by @entity22 from its hair and droppings as it passed through @entity25 and @entity26 in 2009 and 2010 , officials said			1

@entity55 ’s mountain lion population is estimated at 100,000 , mostly living in western regions and seldom travelling more than 100 miles			2
authorities initially believed it was a captive animal that escaped , but tests showed it was not neutered or de-clawed and had no implanted microchips - commonly used in domestic animals			0

although it was an anomaly , mr @entity34 said the presence of the wild mountain lion is a good sign of the ability of @entity14 's conserved land to sustain wildlife			1

this guy had a really adventurous spirit ' state environment official @entity34 genetic testing showed the cat had the same genetic structure of the mountain lion population in @entity13 's @entity21 region			1
genetics experts in @entity134 matched the dna with samples collected from a cat spotted in eastern @entity25 near @entity137 and in northern @entity26 from late 2009 through early 2010			2
it was unclear what route the animal took to @entity14 , but biologists said it could have travelled south near urban areas or north through @entity3			2
