that 's close enough ! the buffalo pursues the car until it gets a mouthful of bread from the lady a lady holds bread from the window as they approach and without warning one sticks its whole head into the car to take the food			1
recoiling as a large tongue winds itself out of its mouth , the squealing woman drops the bread , which is swallowed immediately , before returning to get another piece			0
spotting the bread the buffalo puts its head back through the car ’s window , making the woman scream in excited panic once more			2
without warning the buffalo sticks it head inside the car window , causing the lady to recoil keeping up with the car , the buffalo winds its long tongue around the food and licks the lady as it devours it another lady in the car shouts : ‘ @entity53 up guys , windows up , ’ as the animal looks around for its next bite			1
and after receiving its final piece of bread , the mammal extends its head even further in through the window to give the woman a great big lick			2
