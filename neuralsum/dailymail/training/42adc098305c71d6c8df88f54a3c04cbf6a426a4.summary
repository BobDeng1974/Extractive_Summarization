by @entity0 published : 20:13 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 20:18 est , 27 march 2013 with their colourful bills and theatrical eye markings , they are sometimes called the clowns of the sea			1
but ever since i saw a breeding colony of puffins on an island in the @entity11 , i ’ve had an enormous respect for the bird			1
for much of the year they fish far out in the @entity15			1
they ’re amazing swimmers and can dive 50 metres or more in pursuit of fish			1
then , around this time of the year , they get together on a rocky island or cliff - top to begin their incredible courtship displays			1
a glimpse of a breeding pair ‘ kissing ’ — rubbing their bright orange beaks together in a characteristic bonding activity — is unforgettable			1
in danger : puffins are one of a number of @entity35 species which are suffering because of the cold weather so is the sight of a parent bird returning to its underground nest with half a dozen fish neatly arranged head - to - tail in its bill			1
tragically , this ageless drama is likely to be severely curtailed this year			2
as the country shivers in unseasonably low temperatures , hundreds of frozen and emaciated puffins are being washed up along the east coast			1
experts say they are dying because of wind - chill and the difficulty of feeding in turbulent seas when fish are going deeper			1
one ecologist spoke of it as the worst ‘ puffin wreck ’ in half a century			2
and it ’s not just sea birds that are suffering			2
across @entity61 , the @entity60 winds have plunged nature back into lockdown mode just as she was preparing for her big spring show			1
it ’s as if someone pressed the pause button just at the start of an action adventure movie			2
where i live on @entity73 we ’ve thankfully been spared the snowfall that ’s brought misery to so many parts of @entity61			1
even so , the icy blast from the east has halted spring in its tracks			2
on many hedge - banks primroses have been out for a fortnight			1
but in the biting winds they ’ve become limp and lifeless , tattered imitations of what they were meant to be			2
on the trees and hedgerows bud - burst has ground to a halt			1
even the blackthorn — whose brilliant floral display is the most dependable of all the signs of spring — seems unwilling to put on a show this year			2
cold comfort : farmers have been battling to save lambs as they are born into perishing conditions never has the old adage been truer — ‘ ne’er cast a clout [ warm piece of clothing ] ’ til may is out ’			1
below the flower-less branches , a cock pheasant hunkers down to shelter from the wind			1
in a normal year , he ’d be strutting and scrapping in a ritual contest for a mate			2
today , all he thinks of is survival			2
in the field behind our house , the ewes and lambs have gone out to sparse pasture			2
three weeks ago the turf appeared to be greening up			2
now the plants on which the wealth of the countryside depends are back under starter ’s orders			2
this means both ewes and lambs will be on frugal rations for a while			2
the only thing that ’ll bring better times is a warm soil			2
conditions are far worse in snow - hit areas , of course			1
for many days , exhausted sheep farmers and shepherds have been probing deep drifts for signs of life			0
despite the popular jokes , sheep are intelligent , resourceful animals			0
i ’ve seen our hardy @entity73 sheep survive happily by foraging under a foot of snow			0
but when they ’re trapped beneath drifts several metres deep , there ’s little chance for them			0
that ’s why for many farming families the spring of 2013 will be memorable for all the wrong reasons			0
for a reminder of a kinder spring i re-read a chapter of @entity159 ’s war - time classic , @entity160			1
he writes of march : ‘ at the very end of the month the butterflies reappeared			0
i expect to see peacock and brimstone and tortoiseshell , as a rule , about the third week of the month			0
‘ i count among my great joys in the year this first sight of brimstone hovering in the sunlit lane and feeding on the fresh spring flowers			0
among my great thrills is the sight of those golden wings fluttering over the primroses			0
’ march is also the time for hibernating mammals to wake , says @entity159			0
‘ among mammals , dormice and bats are our only true hibernators			0
in march they begin to stir			0
it is the ear rather than the eye that catches the first signs of returning liveliness — little irritable squeakings , as though they resented the return of spring and would like another month in bed			0
’ for hibernating mammals , the spring of 2013 will provide a very rude awakening			0
mammals such as dormice and hedgehogs spend the weeks before hibernation building up fat reserves to see them through their long sleep			0
when the winter is unusually long — as it has been this year — waking can bring the risk of starvation			0
insect - eating birds and bats are also likely to suffer			1
in the big march chill , insects are scarce			1
so the many small birds and bats that rely on them for food are likely to be on starvation rations			0
so is the wakening frog as it slides from its wintering place among a heap of damp , dead leaves			0
there ’s no food , and when it reaches the pond there ’s a solid layer of ice on top			0
butterflies are nowhere to be seen			0
the numbers of many species were hit hard by the deluges of last summer			1
the current icy weather will come as a further blow			1
battling the elements : sheep farmers have been scouring snow drifts for signs of life yet for all the harshness of this frozen spring , there are compensations , too			0
a couple of days ago i took the high road home across the top of the @entity245			0
in the dusk light , the roadside hedges and trees were painted in the gleaming , almost incandescent white of a thick hoar frost			0
i stopped the car in a lay - by and switched off the engine and lights			1
it was a breath - taking sight			1
the cold @entity60 air was clear as crystal			1
looking across the @entity258 i could see the lights of distant @entity260 as clearly as if it had been at the bottom of the hill			0
and there , in the cold clarity of the frozen night , came the hope that only we humans know			1
however long this extended winter lasts , there will be a spring			0
the half - opened buds will finally burst and blossom will at last drape the trees			1
the hedgerows will explode into life , and bees and butterflies will once more fill the air			0
in fact , there ’s every likelihood that spring — whenever it comes — will be more showy and flamboyant than ever			0
nature has an amazing way of balancing things out			0
it ’s hard to believe that just one year ago we were all concerned about the drought ! there ’s another message from this frozen spring , one that ’s rather more sombre			0
for all our planet - changing skills and technology , we ’re still at the mercy of the cosmos			1
a blast of icy air from the polar regions can even now — if not bring life in @entity61 to a halt — make things extremely uncomfortable			1
however sophisticated our society may be , we continue to depend for our well - being on the elemental forces of nature			1
we ignore them at our peril .			0
