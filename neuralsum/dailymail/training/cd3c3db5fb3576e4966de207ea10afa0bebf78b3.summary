from clearer information on waiting times and treatment to a refurbishment of waiting rooms , measures are being put in place to reduce anxiety in a hospital 's busiest department			1

under attack : designers , psychologists and healthcare experts were commissioned to come up with innovative ways to keep people calm in waiting rooms and protect @entity25 workers new features are likely to include bus stop - style screens with live updates to keep people up to date with waiting times			1
a @entity41 spokeswoman said that designers , psychologists and healthcare experts were commissioned to come up with innovative ways to keep people calm in waiting rooms			0
the year - long project , which was run by the @entity45 , discovered ways to ease patients ' frustration and anxiety and to help them understand why they might have to wait , the spokeswoman said			1
patients are likely to see screens giving live updates about the number and types of cases that staff are dealing with			1
waiting rooms will also display clear signs and maps explaining the different stages of treatment			1
a new approach should be taken to how patients are greeted in the units , it was suggested			0
for managers planning refurbishments , there is specific advice about lighting , decor and seating			0
the suggestions will now be tested in three @entity72 - @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 's and @entity76 ' in @entity77			0
attacks on @entity25 staff are thought to cost at least £ 69 million a year , the spokeswoman said			1
calming measures : three @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 's and @entity76 ' in @entity77 ( pictured ) , will trial new ideas figures published last week showed there were 57,830 assaults on doctors , nurses , paramedics and ambulance crews in @entity26 during 2010/11 – up 1,112 compared with the year before			1
almost 70 per cent of the attacks involved patients not responsible for their actions because of medical conditions , an adverse reaction to treatment , mental health problems or severe learning difficulties			2
fewer than one in 40 attacks ended in a prosecution			0
health minister @entity100 said any violence and aggression towards staff is ' totally unacceptable '			0
' @entity25 staff work hard to save lives every day and they should be able to carry out their work without fear of assault , be it verbal or physical , ' he said			1
' we want to safeguard staff and patients and that is why we asked the @entity45 to look at helping a and @entity116 departments become calmer and safer environments			2
concerns : dr @entity119 said that one attack on a @entity25 staff member was too much ' these are practical solutions to help support and reduce the pressure on busy staff - ways in which hospitals can easily redesign the environment according to their budget and how difficult situations can be diffused by simply giving patients more information			1
' @entity45 chief executive officer @entity132 added : ' for not much more than £ 60,000 hospitals can now quickly and easily install this system which could significantly reduce the burden of aggression from patients			2

‘ quite frankly one is too many			0
no one goes to work expecting to be assaulted and this is all the more upsetting when we consider that some members of the public are attacking the very people trying to help them			0
‘ assaults on staff are never justified , but the worry is that if pressures increase and people wait longer , the levels of frustration will rise			2
' it is somewhat reassuring that sanctions have increased and i hope that this will go some way towards acting as a deterrent			0
everything must be done to prevent members of the public from carrying out threatening or violent acts , and those that choose to do so should be made to face the consequences			0
‘ it is high time trusts step up and look to invest more in prevention and protecting their staff from assaults in the first place			2
’ @entity180 , the unison union ’s head of health , said : ‘ the increase in violence is a national disgrace			0
it is no good saying some of these assaults were the result of patients ’ medical conditions			0
