during the @entity2 , a stream of celebrities poured into the @entity3 to talk about the iniquities of the @entity5			1
star after star called for tighter regulation on newspapers , telling @entity10 how the tabloids had hounded them , made their lives miserable and used every ‘ dark art ’ imaginable			1
but the phone hacking trial has lifted the veil on the other side of the relationship between celebrities and the tabloid press – and it ’s a side @entity10 ’s cast of famous faces was less eager to discuss			1
the jury heard evidence about the alleged affair between @entity26 and @entity27 self - confessed phone hacker @entity31 claimed he had uncovered the relationship when he hacked the 007 actor 's voicemails with combative lawyers prepared to scrutinise the evidence of witnesses , the trial revealed the underbelly of celebrity : how friends , family and even the famous themselves willingly sold stories to the @entity45 for money , influence or to extend their own time in the spotlight			1
there were revelations about @entity53 ’s son @entity52 , socialite @entity54 and @entity55 , ex-wife of golfer @entity56			0
it emerged that former home secretary @entity58 complained to a friend that ‘ hyenas ’ had betrayed him – little suspecting his friend was the one who had tipped off newspapers and would ultimately sell his voicemails to the highest bidder			0
and perhaps most dramatically of all , @entity65 star @entity25 was confronted in court with information that a close member of his own family had sold secrets about him			1
visibly shaken , the actor said the unnamed male relative had admitted giving information to the newspaper but said he had not known the man had taken the tabloid ’s money			1
the jury heard claims the actor had effectively approved a front page story revealing his former fiancée @entity26 ’s affair with @entity82 star @entity27			0
law denied he had sanctioned the 2005 article , but the court heard his publicist had asked the tabloid to ‘ back - date ’ miss @entity26 ’s affair with @entity27 so it would appear she cheated on law before he was caught out in a fling with his children ’s nanny			2
in a taped conversation with a journalist , @entity25 ’s publicist appeared to be speaking on his behalf when she said : ‘ if you could definitely pre-date it so that she cheated first , that ’s the thing he wants the most			0
’ @entity102 , then editor of the @entity45 , was so confident the article had been signed off by @entity25 that he told sub-editors to avoid calling him a ‘ love rat ’ and emailed a colleague saying : ‘ this story is effectively from @entity108			0
’ the affair between @entity110 and @entity27 was a key part of the prosecution case			0
self - confessed phone hacker @entity31 claimed he had uncovered the relationship when he hacked the 007 actor ’s voicemails			1
but miss @entity26 ’s own driver had apparently sold the story to the tabloid for £ 6,000 after catching the actress at a secret rendezvous with @entity27			1
there is no dispute that phone hacking happened at the tabloid			1
miss @entity26 , for example , received £ 100,000 damages from @entity129 ’s @entity128			0
but lawyers at the trial set out to show that journalists and newspapers relied on countless legitimate sources to gather information			2
the judge told lawyers he was anxious the trial should not unravel into a ‘ celebrity chat show ’ dominated by star witnesses			1
unlike the @entity2 – which faced criticism that it gave celebrities a platform to make any complaint about the press they chose , seemingly without challenge – trial witnesses had their evidence scrutinised to the standards of a criminal trial			1
former @entity152 @entity151 and her husband @entity153 sit in a taxi as they leave the @entity156 after being cleared yesterday @entity153 ' deputy and later editor of the @entity45 @entity102 was swept from court after being found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones among the startling revelations : @entity163 the son of footballer @entity53 admitted he had ‘ actively encouraged ’ some media intrusion into his personal life			0
the 33 - year - old pocketed £ 2,000 from the @entity45 for the story of his own sordid nightclub tryst with @entity171 ’s daughter @entity170			0
@entity163 pocketed £ 2,000 from the @entity45 for the story of his own nightclub tryst with @entity171 ’s daughter @entity170 he also passed on stories about his friends			1
mr @entity175 said : ‘ @entity163 is a full - time “ celebrity ”			2
he needs publicity in order to remain a full - time “ celebrity ”			2
he sometimes supplies information to the @entity5 himself			0
’ @entity181 - @entity180 @entity183 ’ goddaughter was revealed as one of the @entity45 ’s sources for information about the @entity187			2
@entity54 was revealed as one of the @entity45 's sources for information about the @entity187 former royal editor @entity190 ‘ outed ’ her as the source for its story about prince @entity195 ’s 21st birthday party at @entity196 being gatecrashed by ‘ comedy terrorist ’ @entity198 in 2003			2
then @entity102 confirmed the newspaper had paid a ‘ female ’ source for this story – and other royal scoops – although he did not name @entity204			0
@entity26 @entity110 - hailed as a ' hacking heroine ' when she took civil action against the @entity45 and gave evidence to @entity10 - used her time as a witness to complain once again about media coverage miss @entity26 – hailed as a ‘ hacking heroine ’ when she took civil action against the @entity45 and gave evidence to @entity10 – used her time as a witness to complain once again about media coverage of the evidence surrounding her ‘ very brief encounter ’ with @entity27			1
‘ this is a really difficult and uncomfortable part of my life to discuss , seeing as it ’s been allowed out of the courtroom and into the hands of the world ’s media to be gossiped [ over ] and analysed , and me vilified for it , ’ she said			0
it ’s been turned into this titillating piece of information			0
i really regret that it has been allowed to be analysed in the way that it has			0
’ trial judge mr @entity175 said he was sorry if coverage had upset @entity110 but assured her the evidence had been necessary			2
he did not say – but some in the courtroom could be forgiven for thinking – that the actress ’ hurt feelings were not his priority in a complex trial in which seven people ’s reputations and liberty hung in the balance			2
@entity243 @entity55 , ex wife of golfer @entity56 , also gave evidence to the court the ex-wife of golfer @entity56 denied claims she had told @entity153 about a ‘ violent event ’ during her 14 - year marriage in the hope @entity153 would expose her ex-husband in the @entity252 mrs @entity55 , who accepted a payout from the @entity45 for phone hacking , denied she had invented her evidence to boost her civil claim for aggravated damages			1
she was accused of telling a ‘ bare - face lie ’ in her evidence , when she claimed @entity153 had told her it was ‘ easy ’ to hack phones			0
mrs @entity55 , 43 , said @entity153 told her about phone hacking at a meeting in 2005 in which the then @entity252 editor had also laughed about her own arrest for an alleged assault on her then husband , @entity267 actor @entity266			1
mrs @entity55 was accused of lying when it emerged that @entity153 ’ arrest did not take place until several weeks after the meeting .			0
