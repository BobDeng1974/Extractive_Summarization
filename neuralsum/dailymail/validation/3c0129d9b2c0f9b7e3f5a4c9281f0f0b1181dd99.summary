sacked : @entity0 , 57 , has lost her latest £ 110,000 - a - year job at @entity2 after her department failed to allocate social workers to look after hundreds of vulnerable children a council manager who retired from her £ 160,000 - a - year job after the deaths of four children only to take a new social services job has been sacked after a fresh scandal , @entity6 can reveal today			1
@entity0 lost her £ 110,000 - a - year job at @entity2 after her team failed to allocate social workers to look after hundreds of vulnerable children			1
@entity2 's @entity17 mayor sir @entity16 has said ms @entity0 was sacked after her ' botched review ' caused her social services department to ' fall apart ' , which could have put children in the city at risk			1
but @entity6 can reveal that she moved to @entity2 despite retiring from her £ 159,346 - a - year job ( total remuneration including pension contribution ) at @entity27 in 2012 as it emerged that the deaths of four children were being investigated			1
one of the serious case reviews probed by child protection experts was the murder of five - year - old @entity32 by his father @entity33 , who burnt then beat his son to death			2
ms @entity0 announced she was retiring from her job as director for family services a day after @entity33 was jailed for life , the council said the timing was coincidental			2
another of the reviews considered whether the authorities could have stopped the murder of eight - week - old @entity45 , who had her skull crushed by her father @entity47 in november 2011 after getting drunk on beer , whisky and vodka			0
@entity51 insisted ms @entity0 's retirement had been spoken about for ' some time ' before the four serious case reviews were announced			1
but instead of retiring completely she then moved to @entity2 as strategic director @entity54 and @entity56 earning between £ 110,000 and £ 115,000 - a - year until her departure on friday			2
revealing her sacking , sir @entity16 said there had been a ' complete failure ' to inform the council 's leadership about the scandal , which meant @entity0 was dismissed with immediate effect			0
he added that her management meant ' children have potentially been put at risk and this can not be tolerated '			0
cases : mrs @entity0 retired from @entity51 in the wake of four serious case reviews , including @entity33 's ( left ) murder of his child @entity32 and @entity75 ' murder of his baby @entity76 ( right ) ms @entity0 was sacked with cabinet member @entity77 after the council was presented with a draft report of a recent @entity81 inspection of its social services department			1
inspectors found that a poorly - managed review of front - line social workers carried out in the summer of 2014 by ms @entity0 ' resulted in more than 30 leaving the authority during which time vulnerable children were put at risk by not being allocated the social workers they needed ' , the council said today			1
critics have today demanded an end to the ' @entity94 ' at the top of councils where staff on huge salaries are allowed to resign or retire after scandals only to quickly find a new ' cushy ' job			0
@entity101 , chief executive of the @entity102 , said : ' it 's bad enough when taxpayers foot the bill for enormous salaries at town halls , but it 's quite another when they are paying rewards for failure			0
' what really angers hard - working taxpayers , though , is when council top brass are removed from their post but find themselves in a cushy role elsewhere in the public sector			0
more has to be done to bring this merry - go - round to a grinding halt			0
' after her recent sacking ms @entity0 has also been suspended as chairman of the @entity122 , a role where she could charge up to £ 500 - per - day for her services			1
she was offered the job last year despite concerns over whether she was as suitable appointment but was removed from her post today			0
a @entity130 spokesman said : ' this morning @entity122 ( @entity131 ) and @entity130 have become aware that @entity0 's interim contract as director of adult services at @entity2 has been terminated			2
' following discussions with ms @entity0 , it has been agreed that she will be temporarily removed , without prejudice , from her position as independent chair of the @entity131 whilst enquiries are ongoing '			2
ms @entity0 was unavailable for comment today .			0
