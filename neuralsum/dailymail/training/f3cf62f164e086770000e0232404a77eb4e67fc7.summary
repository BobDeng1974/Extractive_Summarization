two rogue trader garage bosses have been forced to pay thousands of pounds to customers who were billed for work that was never carried out			1
@entity3 and @entity4 , of @entity5 and @entity6 , gave motorists inflated invoices for repairs to their cars which were unnecessary and in some cases were not even done			1
the pair have now been banned from running a company for 10 years , and ordered to repay their ill - gotten gains after they admitted ' misleading commercial practices containing false information '			1
prosecutor @entity18 told @entity19 yesterday that three customers were wrongly charged £ 1,550 , £ 1,350 and £ 505 respectively			1
banned : @entity4 , left , and @entity3 , right , ran a fraudulent garage business in each of the cases , mechanics had told their customers that they needed to repair or replace their gearbox , but never actually did so			1
they also charged for repairs to brakes , oil and other car parts which were not carried out			1
the company was sentenced to £ 15,000 in fines , and told to pay nearly £ 2,400 in compensation for the bogus invoices			1
judge @entity35 told @entity3 and @entity4 : ' both of you conducted yourselves as company directors with a complete disregard , a blatant disregard , for the trust that hard - working , decent people put in your company to have their vehicles repaired			1
' not only did you provide invoices that were false , you took money from those people , in a way that caused them considerable distress and upset			2
' if it had not been for them being sharp and noticing what had not occurred to their vehicles , you would probably have got away with this			2
i suspect you probably got away with a lot more than is before me			0
' @entity4 , who apparently ran the business , claimed he was not involved in the bogus repairs and did not know what was going on			1
bogus : @entity4 told a pensioner she needed to spend £ 1,600 on her car but never carried out the repairs @entity62 , 74 , was told he needed a new gearbox even though his car showed no sign of having a problem with its gears			1
' he told me a needed a new gearbox and charged me for one , ' he said after the case			2
' i suspected it had not been done			0
i had a good look inside , underneath and on top			0
in my mind , he had n't changed the gearbox			0
' trading standards got an automotive assessor to come and look at my car			2
they saw the clutch had been changed but , in their opinion , it did n't need replacing			0
they agreed that the gearbox had not been changed and neither had the flywheel			0
' a 67 - year - old woman , who asked not to be named , said @entity4 told her after her vehicle was taken for an @entity91 : ' it 's really bad			1
it 's going to cost £ 1,600			2
' she added : ' my husband went grey when he heard about the bill			0
i thought he was going to collapse			0
all it failed its @entity91 on was a bad tyre			0
' we knew then we had been done over so we went straight to trading standards			0
they said they had already got him in their sights			0
' i ca n't think why he could do something like that to people			0
he could see we were n't young			0
would he do it to his own parents ? ' after the hearing , a spokesman for @entity114 said : ' our trading standards team investigated after receiving a number of complaints about how the pair had misled customers by charging for motor repairs that had not been carried out			2
' the company is no longer trading and @entity4 has stopped working in the garage business .			1
