by @entity1 reporter he is the man behind some of the most famous portrait paintings in history			0
yet , ironically , art experts still have relatively little idea what @entity7 himself looked like			1
because the @entity12 genius left no self - portraits from his youth , academics have been forced to explore their suspicions that he may have placed his image into one of his own masterpieces			1
code cracked ? art historian dr @entity21 has presented new evidence which he believes shows that @entity7 used his own face for two apostles , @entity25 and @entity26 , in his painting of the @entity28 staring them in the face ? dr @entity21 references a portrait believed to be of @entity7 in his later years showing him with a @entity34 nose and flowing hair , much like the two apostles			1
@entity25 is also pointing his finger upwards in the 500 - year - old mural , a gesture which @entity7 's contemporaries viewed as a @entity7 trademark now one art historian believes he has uncovered new evidence that the great man inserted himself not once , but twice , into his famous mural , @entity45			1
@entity21 , the author of the international best - seller @entity46 , makes reference to a poem written in the 1490s , while @entity7 was painting @entity45 , by his friend @entity51			2
in it , @entity51 makes fun of an unnamed artist for putting his image into his works ' however handsome it may be '			0
dr @entity21 also cites the famous portrait of a man in red chalk , sketched around 1515 , which is thought to show @entity7 in his advancing years			0
he has a @entity34 nose , flowing hair and a long beard , much like the faces of the apostles @entity25 and @entity26 in the 500 - year - old @entity28			1
clues : according to dr @entity21 , the portrait of a man in red chalk ( left ) , believed to depict @entity7 around 1515 , has similar features to those shown in the two apostles			0
some art experts also believe the @entity74 ( right ) may be a self - portrait steeped in history : @entity45 was painted on an end wall in the dining hall at the monastery of @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity82 , for @entity7 's patron @entity83 and his duchess @entity84 @entity25 's upturned finger was also considered by contemporaries as a trademark @entity7 gesture			1
dr @entity21 told the @entity89 : ' @entity45 is the only work that no one , either crackpot or academic , has tried to identify as a @entity7 portrait			0
' renowned @entity7 scholar @entity93 said : ' of all the apostles that ( @entity7 ) would wish to be identified with , i think @entity25 would be top of his list because @entity7 was a great believer in asking questions rather than accepting what people tell you			1
' @entity45 was painted on an end wall in the dining hall at the monastery of @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity82 , for @entity7 's patron @entity83 and his duchess @entity84			0
it has faded substantially over time , but underwent a 21 - year restoration from the 1970s which sparked considerable controversy because of the subsequent changes in tones and colours			2
finding images of @entity7 in his paintings has become a popular pastime with academics , with some even suggesting that the @entity74 is in fact a self - portrait in disguise			2
@entity119 will publish dr @entity21 's latest research in @entity7 on august 30			0
it will also feature as @entity123 's @entity122 at the same time .			0
