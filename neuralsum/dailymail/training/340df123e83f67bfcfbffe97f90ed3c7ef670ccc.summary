@entity3 's family today said they still do not know how she died , 13 years after her body was found in @entity5 the family of @entity3 said today they still do not know how she died 13 years after she was killed in @entity8 by a millionaire @entity5 property developer			1
@entity3 was 21 when she disappeared in the @entity5 capital where she had been working as a bar hostess in 2000			1
her dismembered body was discovered buried in a seaside cave near an apartment owned by @entity3 , 61 , who could not be charged with murder as @entity3 ’s body was so badly decomposed			1
he was cleared of manslaughter due to a lack of evidence but later found guilty of her abduction , dismemberment and the disposing of her body in 2008 after the @entity3 family appealed			1
an inquest at @entity26 today recorded an open verdict into her death			1
after the hearing @entity3 ’s father @entity29 , 60 , said : ' i really hoped they could have gone through it all and came up with some suggestion of how @entity3 died			1
' @entity3 is now serving life imprisonment for what happened to @entity3 , as well as the rape and murder of @entity40 nightclub hostess @entity39 , who died in @entity8 in 1992 , and a string of rapes on other women			1
mr @entity44 added he felt ‘ let down ’ by the @entity5 court system , where verdicts are determined by three judges rather than a jury			1
he said : ' it is simply not geared up to deal with a case and trial of the nature of @entity3 ’s			2
they depend so heavily on confessionals over there			0
' i ca n’t imagine if it had been in a @entity59 court and such evidence had been presented to a jury of 12 people they would have originally directed there was no case to answer			0
' the @entity5 police were very slow and needed a push to get going but it is the court system that let us down really			1
' @entity3 's father @entity44 ( left ) and sister @entity70 listened as the coroner recorded an open verdict today @entity5 police believe @entity3 , who filmed sex attacks on his drugged victims , could be responsible for up to 900 rapes			1
@entity3 's sister @entity70 , who was 19 when she died , said today ’s verdict made no difference as ‘ lucie ’s still gone			1
’ she said : ' today is just a formality for us , the last thing			0
it ’s over in a way , but it will never be closure for us			0
we still have to live with what happened			0
' i think @entity3 ’s death just reinforces how tragic it is that a 21 - year - old girl can go on holiday with her best friend and end up murdered and here we are 13 years later in a dingy coroners court			2
' the value of life is so important but it ’s family and friends that are left behind who end up living with the sadness of it all			0
“ if it was n’t for @entity3 , a man who had 900 videos of him raping women and killed an @entity40 girl could still be out there			2
' lucie ’s death brought those cases into the public domain and put this serial rapist in prison for the rest of his life			0
' recalling the last time she saw her older sister , @entity70 , now 33 , said : ' it was the night before she flew to @entity5			0
i remember that night i slept with her in her bed			0
@entity3 ( left ) is serving life imprisonment for the abduction of @entity3 ( right ) and dismembering and disposing of her body			1
he has also been convicted of the murder of @entity40 @entity126 ' it was such a long time ago			2
but life goes on , we have to move forward and just cope with things as best we can			0
' she said the hardest times were family occasions , @entity135 and @entity3 ’s birthday			2
on september 1 this year she would have turned 35			0
her dad @entity29 added : ' the thing i find hardest is the life we would have had with @entity3			1
' many of her friends are now married and have children			0
having her future taken away from us and not being able to share it with her is what is most difficult to deal with			0
' earlier the inquest heard several post mortems were performed in @entity5 and the @entity59 which revealed traces of sedatives and the ‘ date - rape ’ drug @entity153 were found in her body			1
an unidentified black substance was also found in her mouth			0
coroner dr @entity158 said : ' it ’s been an awful long time i know			0
i think it is the longest case that i can think of without being concluded			0
even now we do n’t have all the answers we ’d like			0
' @entity165 , pictured with her sister , said the family will never have ' closure ' over her death @entity171 ' court coroner dr @entity158 recorded an open verdict and admitted the family were not given ' answers that would in any way satisfy you ' he told @entity3 ’s family : ' i ’m so very , very sorry you lost @entity3 in such sad circumstances and that no one ’s been able to give the answers that would in any way satisfy you			1
' the inquest heard former @entity186 air hostess @entity3 had only been in @entity5 with her friend @entity187 , also 21 , two months before she went missing on july 1 , 2000			1
that night she had been working at the @entity189 hostess club and is believed to have gone back to @entity3 ’s apartment			2
when she failed to return the next day her friend reported her missing			0
@entity3 ’s parents made several visits to @entity5 and spent thousands of pounds trying to find her			2
but her remains were found on a beach 60miles from @entity8 , near @entity3 ’s apartment , in february 2001			2
she was identified by dna but the coroner said without a cause of death he must record an open verdict			1
