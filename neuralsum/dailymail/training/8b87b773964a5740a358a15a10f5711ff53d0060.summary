@entity5 has announced it is rolling out adverts to the @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , having trialled the concept in the @entity14 since november			1
the @entity14 ads ( pictured ) look like @entity5 pictures posted by friends , but in the top right corner the time is replaced by the word ' sponsored ' adverts were first introduced to @entity5 in the @entity14 in november last year			1
the adverts look like @entity5 pictures posted by friends , but have ' sponsored ' written in the top right - hand corner			1
adverts can be hidden from a feed by clicking the ' more ' button , which consists of three small circles			0
users can give feedback to companies about they liked or disliked a particular advert			0
the first brands to sign up to the scheme were @entity41 , @entity42 's , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
the company said that advertisers has seen positive results ‘ well above the ad industry ’s average for performance ’			2
@entity5 was acquired by @entity57 in 2012 for $ 1bn and has over 200million users across the globe			2
the company said that it is ‘ methodical and deliberate ’ about choosing which brands pop up in users ’ feeds			0
there are strict rules that advertisers have to adhere to , such as no text to accompany images and no product shots			0
instead , images should capture ‘ moments ’			0
in short , the adverts are designed to look like they are posted by your friends			2
adverts being rolled out in the new regions are expected to follow the same format as those shown in the @entity14 and , if their introduction also follows suit , global @entity5 users will initially rubbish the decision to introduce adverts , before accepting and even liking them , as seen with their @entity14 counterparts			1
