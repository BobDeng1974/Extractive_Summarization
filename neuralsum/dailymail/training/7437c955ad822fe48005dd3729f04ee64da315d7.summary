an @entity1 doctor could be struck off for refusing to abort a baby girl because the child 's parents only wanted to have a boy			1
@entity6 said the couple 's request to terminate the 19 - week - old foetus ' offended my moral conscience ' and refused to consider carrying out the procedure			2
but officials claim he had a duty to refer the couple to another doctor for help and advice - and now he could have his medical licence revoked following an investigation into his conduct			2
controversy : gp @entity6 refused to abort a 19 - week - old foetus whose parents did not want to have a daughter ( file photo ) dr @entity6 , 55 , has been practising as a @entity23 in @entity28 , a suburb of @entity30 , for nearly three decades			1
he revealed earlier this year that a couple of @entity33 origin had asked him to abort their unborn daughter because they only wanted a boy			1
the doctor , who is a devout @entity39 and a former activist in the conservative @entity41 , refused the request for ethical reasons			0
however , under @entity45 state law abortion is permitted up to 24 weeks of pregnancy , and doctors who object to the practice are obliged to refer their patients elsewhere			2
dr @entity6 claims he does not know any doctors who would agree to perform a sex - selective abortion			1
home : dr @entity6 , a devout @entity39 , works in the suburbs of @entity30 , pictured ' it 's very wrong , i do n't know any doctor in @entity45 that would be willing to refer a woman that wanted to have an abortion just because of gender at 19 weeks , ' he told @entity62			1
' i refused to refer the patient because there was no medical reason to do it and it offended my moral conscience			0
' but when he went public with his story in april , the @entity68 of @entity45 launched an investigation following a complaint from board members that he had failed his patients			0
officials told him in a letter that his ' professional conduct ' had been questioned , although neither the woman herself nor her husband lodged a complaint against him			0
dr @entity6 said : ' i think it demonstrates the problem with abortion law that stops doctors from using their conscience whether it is appropriate or not			1
' the woman underwent an abortion with a different doctor a few days after seeing her gp			0
however , when she became pregnant again this year she decided not to find out the sex of the baby before it was born			0
sex selection is widely considered taboo in developed countries , but is so popular in parts of @entity98 that there are now many more boys than girls being born in countries such as @entity103 , @entity33 and @entity104 .			0

@entity6 approached by @entity33 woman who was 19 weeks pregnant
she asked for an abortion because she and her husband wanted a boy
dr @entity6 refused and did not refer them to another doctor
he is now under investigation over claims he failed his duty to patients
