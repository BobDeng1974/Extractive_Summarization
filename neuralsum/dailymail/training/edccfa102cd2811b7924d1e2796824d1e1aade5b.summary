@entity1 manager @entity0 has revealed that a move for @entity4 midfielder @entity3 has not progressed			1
@entity0 , speaking following @entity1 's impressive 2 - 1 win over @entity6 , was honest in admitting that @entity3 is no nearer to joining the @entity8 side			1
' there ’s no update on that at the minute to be honest			0
he ’s still @entity4 ’s player			0
there ’s nothing went forward on that , ' @entity0 revealed			1
en route ? @entity1 are interested in signing @entity4 outcast @entity3 for £ 7 million win : @entity17 celebrates his @entity1 goal against @entity6 on sunday afternoon the @entity19 went on to confirm that @entity20 is close to sealing a move back to former club @entity22			1
' @entity20 looks like he 's going to sign for @entity22			1
he 's been great for me since he 's been here			2
it 's a chance for him to go back , he 's in his last year			2
' we 'd obviously lose him in the @entity26 so it 'd make sense going back home			0
if we can do one or two lads to come in , then i 'd look to do it			0
' away from the transfer window , @entity0 believes owner @entity33 's honesty over his desire to sell the club has contributed to their best @entity37 start in eight years			1
@entity1 's 2 - 1 win over @entity6 , a scoreline that does not quite do justice to their dominance for the first hour , took them to seven points from a possible nine heading to the international break			1
that is their best opening three - game return since 2006/07 and a far cry from the embattled atmosphere that shrouded the club towards the end of last season			2
some expected another year of struggle after @entity52 businessman @entity33 put the club on the market in the summer , a move that has yet to lead to any concrete interest , but @entity0 feels the transparency has helped everyone			1
' i think what has helped is the chairman coming out and saying what he said , ' explained the @entity19			2
' that 's given people a clear picture of what is happening			0
' everybody knows the situation with the football club now , the way it is , it 's out there			0
' the chairman 's being great , he 's done everything he can here			0
positive : @entity1 's win over @entity6 on sunday afternoon made it seven points from a possible nine for @entity0 's side gaffer : @entity0 is very happy with the start that his side have made this season ' the crowd have galvanised as well			1
they 've realised if they stick with it and get right behind it i 'm pretty sure we 'll win more than not			0
' @entity1 endured a slightly nervy finale against @entity6 as @entity89 's deflected header halved a two - goal deficit created by the electric @entity91 and @entity17 inside 36 minutes			1
the hosts should have been home and dry by the hour mark , but saw @entity95 and @entity96 denied by the woodwork			0
@entity0 , whose side were dire at home last season , was content to focus on the positives of @entity1 's early dominance			1
' i thought in the first half we were outstanding			0
if we 'd scored another couple i do n't think anyone could have begrudged us that and that would have made the second half a little more easy , ' @entity0 said			2
' @entity111 , especially in the first half , was unplayable today			0
' the movement of the midfield was terrific , the passing was so sharp , our willingness to go and win the game was excellent			0

@entity1 are looking at signing @entity3 for a fee around £ 7 million
