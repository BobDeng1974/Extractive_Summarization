by @entity0 published : 14:02 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 14:17 est , 17 february 2013 fateful night : if proved authentic , the violin of @entity2 will have survived the tragedy in which more than 1500 people lost their lives the violin believed to have belonged to the heroic band master who played as the @entity8 sunk is set to sold at auction for a record price			1
if proved authentic , the violin of @entity2 will have incredibly survived the tragedy in which more than 1500 people lost their lives in the @entity12 on april 15 , 1912			1
the final extensive scientific tests are underway to prove its authenticity but experts believe it to be genuine			1
it is expected to fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds on april 20 when it is auctioned by titanic experts @entity21 and son based in @entity23 , @entity24			1
it has passed all other tests over the last seven years and the results of the last investigation are due early next month			2
a plan of the @entity8 used in the inquiry into the doomed ship sold for a record £ 220,000 in 2011 but it is believed the instrument will exceed this price			2
the anonymous seller of the violin claims that @entity38 , @entity2 ’s bereaved fiancé , retrieved the violin after his death			1
the instrument had been a gift from her			2
the fate of @entity2 's violin has always been a mystery to @entity8 scholars			1
all eight members of the band that gallantly played as passengers lined up for evacuation to the lifeboats perished in the disaster but the bodies of the band leader and two other musicians were pulled from the water by a search crew from the @entity59 and taken to @entity60 , @entity61			2
violinist @entity62 from @entity63 in @entity64 and bass player @entity65 from @entity66 were laid to rest in @entity67 but @entity2 's body was repatriated to @entity69 and buried at @entity70 , @entity71 , the town where he was born and raised			1
gift of love : @entity2 , pictured front row , fourth from left with violin in the @entity75 , was given the violin he played on that fateful night by his fiance @entity38 newspapers at the time reported that @entity2 was found fully dressed with his violin strapped to his chest			1
however , when the effects of @entity85 were itemised by @entity86 of the provincial secretary in @entity60 there was no mention of it			0
other than his clothes and spare change he had only a ring , a pen , a silver matchbox , a gold cigar holder , a watch and chain , a collar stud , a pair of scissors and two pieces of correspondence			0
it was not among the possessions handed back to his father @entity106 who collected the body from the @entity109 at @entity66 docks			0
the assumption has long been that the instrument was spirited away by someone involved in collecting the corpses			2
now the instrument believed to be @entity2 's is currently being handled by the leading titanic memorabilia auctioneer @entity21 and son who hold every record set for items from the ship and are considered the world 's leading authority on its artefacts			1
incredible story of survival : the violin of bandmaster @entity2 who played as the @entity8 ( pictured ) sank , is set to sell at auction for hundreds of thousands of pounds they have so far spent many thousands of pounds seeking to establish beyond any doubt that the violin is the genuine article			1
a spokesman for the company declined to comment on the impending auction			0
but a source close to the sale confirmed : ‘ it is the most iconic and important item ever connected to the @entity8 to come up for sale			0
leading titanic memorabilia auctioneer @entity21 and @entity117 have so far spent many thousands of pounds to prove it was @entity2 's violin ‘ we are talking about high six figures			1
there will be worldwide interest			0
all the tests have proved its authenticity so far			1
there is just one final test left and the results are due in early march			2
if that confirms the authenticity then it will be sold			2
‘ the auctioneers have been thoroughly professional and painstaking over this			0
they have been on the case for seven years			0
’ @entity159 @entity21 said previously : ‘ when i first saw it five years ago i was amazed			0
if i did not think that the probability was there i would not have bothered			0
‘ the research is expensive business but because of the historical importance of this item the money is secondary			0
we can not rush the scientists			0
’ during his research for the band that played @entity174 , a book that tells the story of all eight of the @entity8 's musicians , top @entity171 author @entity170 came across a collection of photographs purporting to show the violin , a leather case , and various sheets of music			1
he said : ‘ i was suspicious at first but when i looked closely i could only conclude that this was the real thing or the result of an extremely elaborate and well informed hoax			0
‘ i am convinced that it is genuine and impressed by the scope of the scientific and historical tests that have already taken place			1
‘ i ca n’t imagine anything more valuable connected to the @entity8			0
’ @entity2 's fiance @entity192 moved to the @entity194 seaside resort of @entity195 after his death but never married			1
she died alone in 1939			0
among the supporting evidence that she retrieved the violin after his death is a 1912 diary where she had apparently drafted a letter to the authorities in @entity60 thanking them for acceding to her wish to have the violin sent to her			1
the draft letter in her diary reads : ‘ i would be most grateful if you could convey my heartfelt thanks to all who have made possible the return of my late fiance ’s violin			1
may i take this opportunity to express my appreciation to you personally for your gracious intervention on my behalf			0
’ mr @entity170 said : ‘ when i checked the name of the provincial secretary for @entity60 it corresponded with what was written in the diary although @entity226 had written @entity227 instead of @entity228			0
the band played on : the band play on as the @entity8 begins to sink in a scene from @entity233 's 1997 film version			2
all eight band members perished ‘ the most convincing thing about the violin , which was in a brown leather case with the initials @entity239 stamped on it , was the inscription on the tail - piece			2
it said : “ for @entity2 on the occasion of our engagement from @entity38 ”			1
‘ this seemed not only to explain why she wanted it back so badly , and why it did n't automatically go to @entity2 's parents , but perhaps why @entity2 kept it with him in the water			1
’ mr @entity170 also points out that the ink letters that were found on @entity2 were near perfect and had not been affected by the sea			2
he said : ‘ because the violin was a gift from @entity38 to @entity2 on their engagement it makes sense that she was the rightful heir rather than @entity2 's parents			1
‘ i wonder whether @entity2 clung on to it so tightly because it was a gift from his wife - to - be			2
otherwise he might just have let it go			0
‘ if this turns out to be what everyone involved hopes and believes it is , i think it will ; be the most expensive @entity8 artefact ever offered for sale			0
it was not only once on the @entity8 but it played a key role in the story			0
on top of that , it symbolises the love of two people			0
