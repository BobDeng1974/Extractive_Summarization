by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 04:37 est , 12 april 2012 @entity3 workers should be forced to delay their retirements now or see £ 750billion added to the national debt , the @entity1 warned yesterday			1
it said the country faced financial ruin if the average lifespan in the @entity3 rose by just three years more than predicted			1
the organisation warned that if that happened , £ 750billion would be added to the national debt by 2050 to pay for the increased cost of pensions and healthcare			1
@entity16 future : the @entity1 suggested a further increase in retirement ages , higher contributions into pension pots from employers and employees , and smaller payouts to those in old age that would push the debt burden up from 76 per cent of national output to as much as 135 per cent			1
in a report into so - called ‘ longevity risk ’ , the @entity29 - based @entity1 urged governments to tackle the problem now before it is too late			1
it suggested a further increase in retirement ages , higher contributions into pension pots from employers and employees , and smaller payouts to those in old age			0
the report also said countries should consider linking the retirement age to life expectancy – an option being explored in @entity46			0
‘ an essential reform is to allow retirement ages to increase along with expected longevity , ’ the @entity1 report said			1
‘ this could be mandated by the government , but individuals could also be incentivised to delay retirement			0
’ the proposals raise the prospect of millions of @entity3 working into their seventies and even eighties			2
the state pension age is already being increased to 67 for men and women by 2028 , and to 68 by 2046			0
warning : the @entity1 said the national debt would spiral out of control if the average lifespan in the @entity3 rose by just three years more than predicted however , experts say linking the pension age to life expectancy would inevitably mean more rapid increases			1
nevertheless , @entity68 , an assistant director at the @entity1 , said such a plan would ‘ keep the number of years in retirement constant ’ and ease the strain on the public finances			1
‘ the longer you ignore it , the more difficult it becomes to resolve , ’ she said			0
‘ the time to act is now			0
’ demographers continue to expect the rise in life expectancy to slow down – but such a phenomenon has yet to occur in @entity3			2
after the @entity83 , when the state pension age was 65 for men , their life expectancy was 66.4 years , while women ’s was 72.5 years			2
in 1977 the government was guided by actuaries who predicted that average life expectancy in 2011 would be 71			2
in fact , men today typically live to 77 , while the figure is 82 for women			0
by 2056 , the life expectancy for a man and woman living in @entity98 is expected to be 84 and 89 respectively			0
the @entity1 said forecasts ‘ have consistently underestimated how long people live ’			2
pension book : over the years as people have began to live longer , the pressure on the country has increased it claimed that predictions about longevity over the past 20 years had been too low by an average of about three years			2
the @entity1 forecasts that the global cost of providing for an elderly population – based on replacing 60 per cent of pre-retirement income – will double over the coming 40 years			1
in advanced countries such as ours , the annual cost will rise from 5 per cent of gross domestic product to 11 per cent			0
‘ if individuals live three years longer than expected – in line with underestimations in the past – the already large cost of ageing could increase by another 50 per cent , ’ the @entity1 argued			1
it said this would heighten the threat to government finances and could also damage ‘ the solvency of private financial and corporate institutions exposed to longevity risk ’			0
the risks were greatest for institutions offering defined benefit pension plans and life annuities , it said .			0

@entity1 predicted national debt could spiral to 135 *%* of national income by 2050 if the average lifespan in the @entity3 rose by just three years more than predicted
