these shocking pictures show a young bear being chained to a tree and attacked by dogs as part of a baiting competition to hone hunting skills in @entity7 , eastern @entity8			1
the controversial contest , held in the forests of the diamond - rich @entity11 , is celebrated in the region as a way of recognising the best canine bear hunter			1
attacks by brown bears on humans are a danger in many parts of @entity8 , particularly at this time of the year as they awake hungry following the long winter hibernation			1
brutal game : the picture shows a young bear chained to a tree while several dogs undergo ' hunting training ' with the predator under attack : @entity29 , a five - year - old bear , can be seen attacked by a number of dogs as she is chained to the tree by her neck tradition : once the dogs have found their way to @entity29 , they have to bark as loudly as they can with their cajoling scored out of 100 points many have to be killed when they encroach into built - up areas looking for food , often with dogs trained to stalk them in order for hunters to shoot them			1
but the images of the five - year - old chained up bear being attacked and bitten are likely to anger animal rights and anti-hunting groups in the @entity53			1
in @entity8 , hunting of many kinds is a respected and mainstream activity and such contests as shown on these pictures raise few eyebrows			2
the pictures were taken by photo - journalist @entity60 during a visit to the @entity62 , near @entity7 , where he captured competitors taking part in the 6th @entity67 contest to find the best individual hunting dog , and the best pairing of dogs , reported @entity71			1
the ' sporting event ' sees the dogs released about 100 metres ( 330ft ) away from the bear , and they have to rely on scents and traces of the animal to find it within two minutes			0
once they have found their target chained to the tree , the dogs have to bark as loudly , and as menacingly , as they can with their cajoling scored out of 100 points			2
the more fearsome the harassment , and the greater the number of bites on the bear , the higher the score for the dog			0
face to face : @entity29 the bear growls at one of the dogs she faces during the cruel ' hunting competition ' near @entity7 , eastern @entity8 dog training : the ' sporting event ' sees the dogs released some 330ft away from @entity29 and they have to rely on scents and traces of the bear to find it within two minutes having fun ? : the dog owners said @entity29 has been used in the ' hunting contests ' for a number of years , even claiming she enjoys them and has grown to understand the dogs the pictures were taken by photo - journalist @entity60 during a visit to the @entity62 , near @entity7 , mr @entity60 said : ' ideally after bursting into a loud bark the dog must attack the beast from behind , constantly twisting it around , thereby keeping the bear in one place and giving the hunter an idea of where to go			1
' rating the work in pairs took into account the coherence and mutual assistance between them			0
' if only one of the dogs attacked the bear actively , the score was reduced and if the second dog did not pay attention to bear at all , the pair was disqualified			2
' the dogs also have to show how well they can stop a bear from running away , replicating what would happen in the wild if they were waiting for a hunter to come and kill it			2
the photographer added : ' it was rather hard to calm the over-heated dogs			0
' seeing that their owner was approaching , the dog began to bark at the beast with renewed energy and it took a lot of effort to pull them back from the bear			0
' cruel : the dogs ' owners stand ready to leash their animals after they have had their go at ' hunting ' @entity156 just within reach : the young bear reaches out in an attempt to get hold of a white dog all over ? @entity29 the bear appears to have decided to take a time out from the fighting , seemingly lying down on her back unusually warm weather across @entity8 has prompted bears to awake from hibernation early with warnings that they could attack people as they forage for food			1
a number of sightings of the animals has been made in parts of @entity175 and the @entity176 in recent weeks , much earlier than normal			0
in the southern @entity175 region of @entity178 - where about 3,500 bears live - two men were savagely attacked , suffering serious head and arm injuries , with one of them losing an eye			2
it is thought that the dogs taking part in the competition in @entity7 were not experienced hunting animals but were instead only there for ' sporting purposes '			0
the bear , called @entity29 , has been used in the contests for a number of years with claims she enjoys them and has grown to understand the dogs			1
mr @entity60 said : ' to aggressive dogs capable of painful bite , @entity29 's attitude was different			0
' despite her apparent slowness , her attacks , like any wild animal , were extremely sharp and unexpected			0
' to be fair , it should be noted that in all the years of holding such events , no dog has been injured by her paws and teeth			0
