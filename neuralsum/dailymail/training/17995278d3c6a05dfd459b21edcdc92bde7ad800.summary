@entity2 @entity1 agents escort a group of undocumented immigrants into custody as they try to cross the @entity6 - a hotspot for illegal immigration on the @entity10 border with @entity11			1
@entity13 arrests rose 65 per cent last year and they hit 16,000 in march alone , fuelled by human smugglers who pay tax to drug cartels			1
attempts to cross the border alone are met with violence			1
about 70 bodies were found in the area in the six months from october , more than twice as many as the same period in the previous year			1
@entity1 agents escort a group of undocumented immigrants in the @entity13 three sets of remains wait to be picked up and examind after they were exhumed in @entity26 , @entity11 just across the @entity6 from @entity27 , @entity11 , stands a dormitory - style shelter filled with people recently deported and other migrants waiting to cross the border			1
the long rows of bunk beds offer immigrants a place to rest on their long journey			0
but the shelter is no safe haven in a town controlled by the @entity41 cartel			0
armed men once showed up and took away 15 men , who were probably put to work as gunmen , lookouts or human mules hauling bales of marijuana into the @entity2			2
as @entity50 takes up immigration reform , lawmakers may have to confront the reality of this place and others like it , where people say the current system of immigration enforcement and deportation produces a constant flow of people north and south that provides the cartel with a vulnerable labor pool and steady source of revenue			0
' this vicious circle favours organised crime because the migrant is going to pay for safe passage ' , said the rev. @entity69 , who oversees immigrant - assistance efforts for the @entity72 diocese			0
the cartel controls who crosses the border and profits from each immigrant by taxing human smugglers			2
at the shelter , the cartel threat was so alarming that shelter administrators began encouraging immigrants to go into the streets during the day , thinking they would be harder to round up than at the shelter			0
there have been record numbers of deportations in recent years and tens of thousands landed in @entity89 already this year , the state that borders @entity11 from @entity91 to @entity92			1
@entity93 is often singled out as the busiest border crossing for immigrants entering the @entity2 , but more and more migrants are being caught in the southernmost tip of @entity11 , in the @entity1 's @entity13 sector			1
the @entity6 snakes westward , forming the border between @entity10 , left , and the @entity2 near @entity100 , @entity11 members of @entity103 forensic team exhume body of an unclaimed illegal immigrant in @entity26 , @entity11 the @entity13 area has become the busiest sector for illegal immigration on the @entity2 - @entity10 border those arrested , pictured , are part of a 50 per cent increase in illegal immigration in the last year apprehension statistics are imperfect measures because they only capture a fraction of the real flow , but the arrest numbers are definitely shifting			1
arrests in the @entity119 , @entity93 , sector dropped 3 per cent last year , while @entity13 arrests rose 65 percent			1
the makeup of the immigrants apprehended here is changing , too , driven by people flowing out of @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			0
the @entity1 made 94,532 arrests of @entity130 immigrants along the south - west border last year , more than double the year before			1
and nearly half of those came in the @entity13 sector			2
the @entity1 is responding by redirecting personnel , sending most new graduates from its academy to the @entity13 , according to senior @entity1 officials			2
when immigrants from @entity140 and @entity10 arrive in @entity91 ahead of their trip to @entity140 , they are met by smugglers who have to pay the cartel tax for every person they take across the border			1
attempts to cross alone are met with violence			1
some immigrants are kidnapped and their families extorted by the organisation			0
reported murders in @entity89 , the state that borders @entity11 from @entity91 to @entity92 , increased more than 250 percent in the past four years , according to the @entity10 government			1
official statistics are generally thought to undercount the real toll			0
soldiers recently killed six gunmen in a clash in @entity91			0
and yet , even with the high - degree of danger for immigrants crossing this part of the border , they keep coming			2
members of @entity166 archeology and forensics laboratory dig up the casket of an illegal immigrant at the @entity169 in @entity26 , @entity11 the @entity6 , which forms the border , is a hotspot for illegal immigration tracks left by the @entity1 await immigrant footprints in a field near the border @entity140 migrants continue to use the route up the @entity180 side of @entity10 and through @entity89 because it 's the shortest to the @entity2 , said @entity181 , a professor at @entity182 in @entity183			1
the smugglers choose the route , and even if immigrants have heard about the violence in @entity89 , ' they trust that the premium they 've paid includes the right of passage , ' he said			2
they continue to leave their home countries for economic reasons			0
although the @entity2 economy has provided fewer jobs for immigrants during the @entity199 and a long , slow recovery , opportunities south of the border have been even more limited , @entity193 said			2
that 's why the rev. @entity202 , a @entity203 priest who founded a shelter for immigrants in the southern @entity10 state of @entity207 , said the answer is in regional development , not increased border security			1
' this situation has grown because ultimately the migrants are merchandise and organised crime profits in volume , ' he said during a recent visit to @entity91			0
@entity217 , a member of the @entity218 whose district includes @entity27 , said the immigration - reform debate has so far left out discussion of the security and economic development in @entity10			2
' the incentive for people to cross over illegally from @entity10 will never subside until these individuals feel safe and until they are able to feed themselves and their families , ' @entity217 said			1
at the 150 - bed shelter , more than half of the immigrants have just been deported from the @entity2 , @entity69 said			0
the others are immigrants preparing to cross			2
he said shelter workers constantly chase out infiltrators who are paid by smugglers to recruit inside			0
at @entity202 's shelter in southern @entity10 , threats from organised crime forced them to bring in four state police officers and four federal ones , who have lived at his shelter for the past year as protection			1
@entity202 now travels with bodyguards after having fled @entity10 for a couple of months last year following threats			1
one immigrant at the @entity91 shelter was a 48 - year - old man who would only give his name as ' @entity248 ' because he feared for his safety			0
he said he had arrived two days earlier after traveling from @entity250 , @entity125			0
@entity248 said he had lived in @entity251 for 10 years but had been in @entity125 for the past four			0
he was trying to make it back to @entity253 , where he has a 15 - year - old daughter			0
asked about his prospects for successfully crossing the river , he said : ' it 's difficult , not so much for the @entity1 '			0
his chief concern being the cartels .			0

arrests up 65 per cent on @entity10 border with @entity11 as drug cartels drive *lucrative* human smuggling trade
number of bodies found in @entity13 doubles in a year as those attempting to cross the border alone are met with violence
