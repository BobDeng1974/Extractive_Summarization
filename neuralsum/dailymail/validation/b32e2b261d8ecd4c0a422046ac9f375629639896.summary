the soothing tones of @entity1 drifted through the air at @entity3 as the teams prepared for extra-time			2
some were down on their haunches , receiving pellets of information , others flat on their backs receiving muscle rubs			2
' @entity13 , ' sang @entity1			2
if this were @entity18 cricket it might have been his theme tune , a special request on his 37th birthday			2
why worry ? this was all under control			2
someone seemed to be guiding @entity25 on a celestial path into the last eight			1
was it @entity29 ? @entity30 ? @entity31 ? @entity32 ? @entity33 and the @entity32 ? or another other - worldly force			1
@entity25 players look dejected after being dumped out of the @entity36 at home to @entity38 @entity25 boss @entity33 looks furious on the touchline after watching his team twice concede a lead turned out it was none of them			1
turned out there was something to worry about			2
that something was @entity38 , a team with bottle to match their talent			1
a team which took everything @entity33 could throw their way , scored twice from set - pieces and emerged triumphant			1
it leaves @entity25 to focus on the @entity56 title			1
@entity57 looked down from his seat in the @entity59			2
the @entity36 will have to wait for another year			1
and it leaves @entity61 football to contemplate the prospect of no teams in the last eight for the second time in three years			2
@entity25 can have no complaints			1
almost every decision went their way			2
still @entity33 had the audacity to shake his head when the fourth official declared two added minutes at the end of extra time			1
@entity57 looks down from his seat in the @entity59 as @entity25 crashed out of @entity71 his players left the pitch in scenes reminiscent to the defeat against @entity76 , only this time they would not blame the referee			1
and it all seemed to be going to plan , when the chaos first descended before half - time , @entity33 snuggled back into his seat alongside @entity82 in the @entity25 dug - out			1
a few yards to his right , @entity83 was flapping his arms in despair			2
on the pitch , @entity87 was in danger of losing control			1
story of the game : minute 31 , minute 43 , minute 58 , minute 96 , minute 114 as is the fashion at @entity3			0
at least , that 's how it went on the previous outing , an equally frenzied draw against @entity98 , the fall - out of which was still falling out days later			0
@entity38 manager @entity83 holds his arms out in the direction of the fourth official as @entity33 looks on former @entity25 man @entity87 gestures towards @entity102 striker @entity101 during wednesday 's encounter here was @entity33 's chaos theory unfolding again			1
traps set were stumbled into by @entity38 , a club still naive to the injustices of this competition in the closing stages , when the teams are so tightly matched , tactics cautious and the importance of decisions by the officials magnified beyond belief			1
@entity25 learned the hard way over the years but are now among the most seasoned			1
they break up play , they milk the contact , they circulate the tacklers , they over-react and pressurise the officials			0
on the side , @entity33 and the @entity32 do their bit			0
it does not guarantee anything , of course			0
not against this calibre of opposition			0
but every little helps , and their manager understands this better than most			0
hence his pre-match posturing and the clear mind to react when the tie tilts and blurs			0
@entity131 took the ball around @entity30 ( right ) but rattled the post with the goal exposed @entity38 frontman @entity131 reacts after missing the chance to put the @entity137 side ahead in the 58th minute as the first half ended in manic scenes , @entity33 made his decisions			1
here was the theory amid the chaos			0
off came @entity143 , to prevent a second yellow card , to tighten the centre of the pitch with @entity147 and to add the fizz of @entity149			1
cards played , the manager was tenser and prowled his technical area during the second half , his hands sunk into his coat pockets , until it was time to remonstrate and demand more his players			0
tighter , faster , they could not allow the tempo to slip against @entity38			1
perhaps he should have scored			2
his team - mates threw themselves to the turf in despair			0
minute 43 was a penalty @entity25 might have had			1
minute 31 was the red card for @entity167			1
it was harsh and it might have killed off weaker teams			0
they have bottle to go with their ability			0
@entity38 striker @entity167 is shown the red card after a collision with @entity25 's @entity143 the 33 - year - old heads into this challenge with @entity143 ( left ) in the first - half which got him sent off the @entity38 forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with @entity143 @entity25 captain @entity183 ( left ) reacts after @entity167 's tackle on @entity143 in the first - half at @entity185 @entity25 had work to do			1
they had to stop football breaking out , for one thing , because when it did , the @entity189 were better at it			0
as in @entity170 , @entity30 came under fire as those in front of him started to wilt			0
it has been an intense campaign and , despite his fears about the relentless intensity of the @entity61 game and the way some training sessions are more competitive than the games in @entity189 football , @entity33 has been low on rotation			0
he has relied instead on the rotation enforced by various suspensions			0
on thursday night he lost @entity207 , and the decision to send on @entity209 backfired when they conceded almost immediately			0
minute 81 they liked at @entity212			0
minute 86 , not so much			0
when @entity214 scored , the first thing @entity33 did was to turn to the crowd and urged calm			1
then he sent on @entity209			0
when @entity87 equalised , again he called for calm			1
this time the message was aimed at his players			0
take it into extra-time if necessary , with the extra man			0
no - one had minute 114 on their @entity98 bingo card			2
this time the chaos theory did not work			0
@entity38 defender @entity87 celebrated excitedly after scoring against his former club at @entity3 @entity229 's late header loops over the outstretched arm of @entity30 to knock @entity25 out			1

@entity25 out of the @entity36 after away goals defeat by @entity38
@entity167 was given a straight red card for a foul on @entity143
@entity214 opened the scoring for @entity25 before @entity87 equalised
@entity29 scored from the penalty spot following @entity229 *handball*
@entity243 defender made amends with header six minutes from the end
