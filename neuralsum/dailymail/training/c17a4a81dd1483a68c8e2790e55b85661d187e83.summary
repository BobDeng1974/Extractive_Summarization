@entity2 ’s @entity1 app is designed to help you get the most out of life by improving your well - being and fitness			1
but could it also be used to predict when you ’ll die ? that ’s what a new app called deadline is claiming , saying the tech can be used to predict exactly when you ’ll kick the bucket			1
the morbid app uses a variety of data including your blood pressure , height and sleep pattern to come up with the prediction that is apparently accurate to the second			2
an app created for @entity25 - based @entity2 's @entity24 predicts when you 'll die			1
called @entity9 ( pictured ) it apparently uses @entity2 's new @entity1 technology to give you a ' ticker ' ‘ you 're going to die			1
sorry , we all do eventually , ’ company @entity30 writes on their @entity32 page			0
the app costs £ 0.69 ( $ 0.99 ) and is available now for @entity2 devices with @entity24 or later			1
first your heart stomps pumping , so the flow of blood around your body stops , according to the @entity41			0
this causes the blood to coagulate , forming clots and becoming thick and lumping			0
your muscles then stiffen in a process known as rigor mortis , which also stops you breathing and means no oxygen gets to your cells			0
your cells thus too begin to die , releasing enzymes that make your body very welcoming to bacteria and fungi			2
these decompose and putrify your body and ultimately , within a year or so , most of the flesh on your body will have decomposed leaving just your bones behind			0
‘ but , what if you knew the date of your death ? ‘ would it motivate you to be healthier ? ’ the company claims to use @entity1 data , in addition to a few questions about your life style , to give you an estimated time of death			1
it pulls in a variety of information and tells you how long you ’ve got to live in years , months , days , hours , minutes and seconds			0
living a healthier lifestyle will apparently give you a longer life expectancy in the app. and with @entity2 ’s new notification system for @entity75 8.1 the app will keep your ‘ ticker ’ updated on your home screen			1
however , according to @entity80 the app ’s claims of being accurate are not entirely true , instead being just ‘ a genetic algorithm that forecasts your death ’			2
the ticker ( left ) shows you the time down to the second that you 'll die			1
exercising more and improving your health ( right ) increases life expectancy			1
however some have said the app just uses a random algorithm earlier this week a video from the @entity41 talked through the exact process of how you die			1
from your bodily functions shutting down to the process of embalming to make you presentable for your funeral , all of the gruesome details were discussed			0
when blood stops circulating your cells begin to die			2
this makes your body bacteria and fungi start to decompose your body			0
to stop this scientists can pump you full of chemicals - called embalming			2
this keep you presentable for about a week such as for your funeral			0
but ultimately your body will decompose to bones in a year or so .			0
