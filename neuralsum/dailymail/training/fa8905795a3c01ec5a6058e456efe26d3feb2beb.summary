@entity0 has threatened to fast - track the execution of a would - be suicide bomber the @entity4 is trying to free if the terror group kills its captured pilot , it was reported today			1
the government has apparently warned that @entity8 and other jailed @entity10 commanders would be ' quickly judged and sentenced ' in revenge for @entity13 's death			2
it comes after a deadline for a possible prisoner swap allegedly set by @entity10 passed yesterday with no clue over the fate of @entity19 or fellow @entity22 hostage @entity20			1
intelligence sources said @entity10 's refusal to prove that @entity13 was alive meant any deal with the militants was doomed			1
now @entity0 has reportedly stepped up its rhetoric by warning of its intent to retaliate if the negotiations end in bloodshed			2
@entity34 , chief international correspondent for @entity37 's @entity36 newspaper , told @entity38 : ' i have reliable contact in the @entity0 government who says a message has been passed to @entity10			1
' it warns that if they kill the pilot they will implement the death sentences for @entity8 and other @entity10 prisoners as soon as possible			1
@entity10 is threatening to kill him unless @entity0 releases a terrorist @entity0 has threatened to fast - track the execution of a would - be suicide bomber the @entity4 is trying to free if the terror group kills @entity19 , seen here after being captured in @entity56 in december in its latest audio recording , @entity10 threatened to kill @entity51 if a deadline was not kept for the release of would - be suicide bomber @entity65 by dusk @entity68 time thursday - around 5.30pm ( 2.30pm gmt ) ' there are other prisoners in @entity0 that @entity10 would like to free			1
' @entity38 has attempted to contact the @entity0 government for comment , but a spokesman has not yet responded			2
shortly after reports of the ultimatum emerged , @entity0 issued a statement saying they were still waiting for proof that the captured f - 16 pilot was still alive			1
@entity0 had agreed to an @entity10 demand to free @entity65 who failed to fulfil her @entity82 mission as a suicide bomber			1
in return , @entity10 said it would not execute the 26 - year - old pilot , who was seized in december after crashing near its hq in the @entity56 city of @entity57			1
in its latest audio recording , @entity10 threatened to kill @entity13 if a deadline was not kept for the release of @entity65 by dusk @entity68 time yesterday - around 5.30pm ( 2.30pm gmt )			1
but it appeared to make no promises to release him , another condition the @entity0 government is demanding			2
it was not clear from the recording what would happen to mr @entity20 if the deadline was missed			2
@entity0 has threatened to speed up the execution of a would - be suicide bomber the @entity4 is trying to free if the terror group kills its captured pilot @entity102 , seen above in a picture being held by fellow hostage @entity20 in a video posted by @entity10 last week demanding the release of an @entity68 terrorist the @entity0 government has apparently warned @entity10 that @entity8 and other jailed @entity109 extremists would be ' quickly judged and sentenced ' in revenge for pilot @entity51 's death @entity22 also said it had no new progress to report			1
@entity22 prime minister @entity113 said every effort was being made to secure the release of journalist @entity20			1
' we are gathering and analysing information while asking for cooperation from @entity0 and other countries , making every effort to free @entity20 , ' he told a parliamentary panel			1
government spokesman @entity122 told reporters repeated @entity22 's ' strong trust ' in @entity0 to help save the freelance journalist			1
mr @entity122 said the government had been in close contact with mr @entity20 's wife @entity128 , who released a statement pleading for her husband 's life			2
' i fear that this is the last chance for my husband , and we now have only a few hours left , ' ms @entity128 said in a statement released through the @entity137 , a @entity138 - based organisation for freelance journalists			0
ms @entity128 said she had avoided public comment until the last minute to try to protect her daughters , a newborn baby and a two - year - old , from media attention			0
showing the strain : @entity22 prime minister @entity113 reacts during a meeting as the country anxiously awaits news of a prisoner exchange with @entity10 which was due to take place at sunset in the @entity152 stress : @entity154 , the father of @entity0 pilot @entity51 who has been taken hostage by @entity10 , is seen after meeting with @entity0 's @entity157 following a protest by the pilot 's relatives at the entrance to the royal palace to ensure the government does all it can to secure his son 's release an audio message purportedly posted online by @entity168 said the @entity0 pilot , lieutenant @entity51 , would be killed if would - be suicide bomber @entity8 was not delivered to the @entity171 border by sunset yesterday , @entity68 time			1
there was no mention on whether the pilot or mr @entity20 would be traded for her			2
the authenticity of the recording could not be verified independently but the possibility of a swap was raised on wednesday when @entity0 said it was willing to trade @entity8 for the pilot			1
after sundown in the @entity152 , with no news on the fate of either lt @entity13 or mr @entity20 , the families ' agonising wait dragged on			2
in the @entity0 capital @entity191 , the pilot 's brother @entity188 , said his family had ' no clue ' where the negotiations stood			2
' we received no assurances from anyone that he is alive , ' he said			0
' we are waiting , just waiting			0
' @entity0 's government spokesman , @entity198 , signalled last night that , in any case , a swap was on hold because the hostage - takers had not delivered proof the pilot was still alive			1
@entity8 , 44 , faces death by hanging for her role in a suicide bombing , one of three simultaneous attacks on @entity191 hotels in november 2005 that killed 60 people			0
she survived because her belt of explosives did not detonate			0
she initially confessed , but later recanted , saying she was an unwilling participant			0
@entity215 and anxiety : people gather at the @entity219 border control in @entity171 , one of the possible sites where it is believed the prisoner exchange deal between @entity10 and @entity0 would have taken place dr @entity225 , from @entity227 's @entity226 , believes that a prisoner swap would benefit @entity10 in the short - term , for propaganda purposes , but would ultimately weaken them			1
he told @entity38 : ' the @entity232 and the @entity234 government are probably the only governments that have taken an assertive stance towards not negotiating with terrorists			0
' a prisoner swap will only have propaganda value for @entity10			1
' it is not of any operational significance			0
but symbolically they will be able to demonstrate to their own people and potential recruits in the @entity246 that they have the bargaining power to issue demands to powerful governments			0
' also , @entity10 needs this symbolic success as the fall of @entity252 is a major symbolic defeat after they poured so many resources in it			0
' after all it seems they will not prevail there			0
it is also a significant blow against the @entity0 government , which as part of the @entity232 - led coalition is under significant domestic and external @entity22 pressure to do something			1
' @entity10 would make @entity0 look weak compared to local extremists in @entity0 and to coalition partners , most notably the @entity232			1
' but to be honest , with @entity10 urgently in need for new financial resources , i think that a prisoner swap is always better than ransom			1
' the initially claimed ransom would have added significantly to their budget ( it would have covered 10 per cent of their annual budget )			0
they ca n't smuggle oil anymore , avenues of extortion have been exhausted			0
' so kidnap for ransom is the only significant income they can generate			0
not getting the money is a good thing			0
it will weaken rather than significantly strengthen the organization			0
' we ca n't say much about the swap at the moment			0
just that it will be done by intermediaries			0
but both sides would be stupid to try to use the actual swap at the border to play games			0
for @entity0 it will jeopardise the life of their pilot and for @entity10 it would undermine their credibility as negotiation partners in kidnapping cases			1
' as i said , @entity10 needs kidnap for ransom to maintain their financial self - sufficiency			2
' a man , believed to be an islamic state militant , is seen near the northern @entity56 town of @entity312 as he is pictured from the @entity171 border town of @entity219 , where it is believed the prisoner swap may take place she is from the @entity68 city of @entity319 and has close family ties to the @entity68 branch of @entity82 , a precursor of @entity168			1
three of her brothers were @entity82 operatives killed in fighting in @entity68			0
@entity0 has faced tough choices in the hostage drama			2
releasing @entity8 , implicated in the worst terror attack in @entity0 , would be at odds with the government 's tough stance on @entity109 extremism			0
but @entity157 is under domestic pressure to bring home @entity334 , who was captured in december after his @entity0 @entity335 crashed near the @entity168 ' de facto capital of @entity57 in @entity56			2
he is the first foreign military pilot to be captured since the @entity232 and its allies began air strikes against @entity168 more than four months ago			0
@entity0 's participation in the air strikes is unpopular in the kingdom and the pilot is seen by some as the victim of a war they feel should not involve the country			2
lt @entity13 's relatives have expressed such views and accused the government of bungling efforts to win his freedom			0
' they abandoned @entity13 , the son of the army ! ' chanted protesters gathered at a ' diwan ' , or meeting place , in @entity191 for tribesmen from @entity357 , southern @entity0			0
ms @entity128 has revealed that she exchanged several emails with her husband 's captors and that in the past 20 hours she received one that appeared to be their final demand			0
she urged the @entity22 and @entity0 governments to finalise a swap that would free both hostages			1
' i beg the @entity0 and @entity22 governments to understand that the fates of both men are in their hands , ' she said			1
the hostage drama began last week after @entity10 released a video showing mr @entity20 and another @entity22 hostage , @entity376 kneeling in orange jumpsuits beside a masked man who threatened to kill them in 72 hours unless @entity22 paid a £ 132 million ransom			1
that demand has since apparently shifted to one for the release of @entity8			0
the militants have reportedly killed mr @entity384 , 42 , although that has not been confirmed .			0
