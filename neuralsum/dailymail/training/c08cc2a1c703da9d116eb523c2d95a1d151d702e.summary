@entity2 ’s 100th @entity1 appearance was clearly something to celebrate — though perhaps the @entity5 skipper was being a touch ambitious by attempting to score from 100 yards , his first - half free kick falling short and dribbling wide			1
still it is a remarkable achievement for @entity2 , who made his first appearance in the competition as an ungainly 22 - year - old against @entity13 club @entity12 alongside @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 in 2003			1
@entity5 captain @entity2 reached 100 @entity1 appearances for the club on tuesday night @entity2 ( right ) made his @entity1 debut as a 22 - year - old against @entity13 club @entity12 in 2003 @entity20 warned that his former club ’s ground could be a bit of a bear pit			1
and so it proved with the incessant chanting and deafening whistles that greeted the first - half performance of @entity30 referee @entity29 showing @entity32 fans at their vociferous best			2
their anger reached a peak when former @entity37 player @entity36 opened the scoring			0
@entity39 boss @entity20 warned his side that @entity32 's @entity41 could be a bit of a bear pit @entity36 ( second right ) scored the only goal of the game as @entity5 won 1 - 0 at @entity32 @entity47 is a little too slow around the pitch to justify his £ 37million price tag for some @entity51 sides			2
certainly @entity52 baulked at paying that in august			0
that said , he knows his role in front of the back four well and his muscular frame represents a considerable obstacle			0
@entity61 would be glad to have a player with those qualities at @entity64 on sunday			0
@entity32 midfielder @entity47 ( right ) attracted interest from @entity52 in the summer a world champion he may be but @entity67 is on a miserable run in front of goal			1
after some wayward finishing against @entity72 last week he missed two great chances here			0
maybe @entity20 had a point when he told him to be more clinical after a hat - trick at @entity76 last season			0
@entity67 ( bottom ) endured a torrid night in front of goal for @entity5 against @entity32 @entity67 ( right ) missed a glorious chance in the first half to give @entity5 the lead but saw his shot go wide			1

@entity2 made his 100th @entity1 appearance on tuesday
@entity5 captain made his competition debut against @entity12 in 2003
