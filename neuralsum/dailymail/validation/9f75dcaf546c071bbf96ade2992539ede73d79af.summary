two single beds @entity1 , canes hanging from coat hooks and retro @entity5 food tins on a gingham - covered countertop - these are the poignant images that capture the lives of two elderly sisters in their family home			1
@entity12 and @entity13 were born in the house in @entity15 , @entity16 , in 1916 and 1922 , never married and even shared a bedroom in their family home for 27 years until @entity12 's death in 2008			1
now their quiet , old fashioned life together has been documented by a photographer @entity23 , with her picture series , @entity25			1
@entity12 's picture is in the centre , to the right is their brother @entity36 in his @entity38 uniform the new owners have kept the enamelled pots and pans and other vintage pieces of kitchenware and continue to use a ' cool cupbord ' with perforated metal door and sides for storing cheese , butter and eggs @entity50 ( left ) was born , lived and died in her home in @entity15 , @entity16 ; after the loss of her sister in 2008 , @entity13 , now 99 , ( right ) sold the house in 2013 to move into a care home @entity23 's pictures are as much a document of the sisters ' lives together and of a glimpse of a vanishing @entity5			1
her images record an immaculately kept house with vintage features such as antimacassars on the armchairs , tins of treacle in the kitchen , a dressing table and highly - patterned carpets			1
there are no computers cluttering up surfaces , or plugs , wires and cables wending around furniture and only a few black and white photographs decorate on the walls			0
the women were born into a well - known local family , which originally set up a successful coaching business in the town in the 1840s			2
they also had two brothers @entity86 and @entity88			0
@entity23 said : ' very much a family home in the early days , the sisters shared the house with their mother and their @entity93 until both mother and aunt passed away			1
this was @entity12 's home all her life			1
' aged 23 and 17 respectively when the @entity100 broke out , the @entity13 sisters came of age in an era of thrift , rationing and self - sacrifice			1
and their wartime experiences are evident throughout the house			2
the dressing table in the twin bedroom that @entity12 and @entity13 shared			1
their beds are seen reflected in the mirror the new owners have kept the old @entity115 hoover along with the carpet that remains in this room @entity12 and @entity13 shared a bedroom from the 1950s until @entity12 's death			1
the picture on the wall is of their family friend and @entity125 pilot @entity124 who was never found after bailing out over the sea near @entity127 both of their brothers survived the war and there is a picture of @entity86 , who served in @entity134 and @entity135 while @entity88 fought in the jungles of @entity137 , on the guest bedroom mantelpiece			2
in their neat , almost spartan , room is a black and white photo of their family friend and @entity125 pilot @entity124 who victory - rolled over the house whenever he flew over the island			2
on 4 june , 1941 , he was seen to bail out over the sea near @entity127 but was never found			0
the smaller photograph in the corner of the same frame is @entity149 , a bomber pilot who was engaged to one of their cousins			0
he failed to return from a bombing mission over @entity154 in 1940			0
@entity23 said : ' in 1957 @entity13 left to live in @entity155 , though returned to the house almost every weekend			1
on retiring in 1981 she returned to live with her sister and they remained there together until @entity12 's death			2
' neither of them ever married			0
despite being a large house the sisters shared a bedroom right up until @entity12 passed away			1
' these plastic flowers were given to the sisters by the grandmother of the woman who delivered their lunches in the last two years of @entity12 's life			1
@entity173 remembers how impractical these armchair ' tables ' were andmugs of tea would slip off unless held on to tightly @entity13 sold the house in 2013 but her coat still hangs on the coat rack along with the sisters ' canes ( left ) ; the women hung their sunday best dresses on the back of the bedroom door ( right )			1
their niece @entity173 , who says her aunts were always smart dressers , remembers @entity12 wearing this two - piece on warm summer days the @entity16 - based photographer was asked to take her camera around the house by the new owners after @entity13 - the last of the @entity13 family in @entity15 - sold her house in 2013 to move into a care home			1
she said : ' the new owners are lovely - a middle - aged couple with a teenage daughter			2
they are all massive appreciators of old things so it could n't be in better hands			0
' they 've kept a lot of the sisters ' furniture and objects , selected from the things that the sisters ' family did n't want , many of which are currently in storage , but they plan to display them around the house once the decorating is completed			1
' they invited me to come and document the house precisely because they appreciated it all so much - they really wanted a record of how it was			2
i presented them with an album of photographs at the end of the project			0
' the pictures took first place in the @entity232 at the @entity233 this month			0
the new owners of the house have kept this @entity238 's @entity237 tin and many other old containers including over-the - counter medicines and salves , with a view to displaying them in the house in future the sisters had an identical much - loved chair and even @entity13 is n't sure whether this one was hers or @entity12 's @entity23 documented the interior before it was renovated			1
she said : ' @entity250 had changed for many years and the house was full of wonderfully dated features			2
but the house wo n't be entirely transformed			0
' they 're keeping the essentials of the house the same - lots of paint required and a few new curtains and carpets , but pretty minimal really as they want the house to retain its wonderful character , ' she said			0
' for example , keeping the woodchip wallpaper , just giving it a lick of paint , and holding on to some of those amazingly dated carpets			0
even the old hoover has been kept as it 's working perfectly			0
' the biggest change is the kitchen - it was absolutely tiny , a galley kitchen really : the kitchen pans photograph was only just about doable with a wide angle lens and the camera right against the opposite wall			0
so the old sitting room is now a wonderfully spacious kitchen with window out on to the garden			0
' the rug was made by @entity93 's long - term boyfriend ' @entity283 '			0
the pair stepped out every wednesday afternoon until he passed away but they never married			0
the blue china dog also belonged to @entity93			0
