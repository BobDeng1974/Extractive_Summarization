one of the most bizarre decisions of the season so far occurred in @entity2 on saturday afternoon between @entity3 and @entity4			0
the visitors were denied a seemingly perfectly legitimate goal inside the opening 15 minutes , with referee @entity8 deeming the ball had gone out of play before re-entering the field and ending up in the back of the net - ruling out the effort			0
the @entity4 players were left flabbergasted at the decision , expressing their disbelief at @entity18 - who instead awarded a corner			2
@entity4 close on in goal as they look to take an early lead against title rivals @entity3 the ball loops in the air as it looks to be heading towards @entity3 's goal the referee deems the ball went over the bar before reentering the field of play awarding a corner the ball ends up in the net as @entity4 look to have taken the lead inside the opening 15 minutes a @entity4 looks on in disbelief after the award of a ghost corner as opposed to a goal the referee waves away the protests as he stands by his decision to award a corner as opposed to a goal quite how @entity8 came to the decision of awarding a corner was particularly baffling , with the ball clearly remaining in play throughout the period			1
it would prove extremely costly for the visitors who eventually fell to a 3 - 0 defeat against their title rivals			1
and to compound matters @entity3 leapfrogged @entity4 in the process , moving up to second in the @entity59 just three points off the leaders @entity62 .			0
