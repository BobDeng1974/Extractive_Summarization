the huge cheque was almost a quarter of the £ 3.1million donated to the party in the third quarter of this year			1
the @entity1 union , run by @entity20 , was @entity3 's biggest donor in the third quarter of 2013 , despite the public spat with @entity4 ( right ) over allegations of vote - rigging in @entity15 labour sources insisted there was ‘ absolutely no link ’ between the donation and the dropping of the inquiry into the @entity15 scandal			1
a source said the cash was a regular instalment of affiliation fees taken from union members ’ subs			0

mr @entity39 said : ‘ despite @entity4 ’s promises of change , nothing has changed			0
the union bosses still buy the policies , fix the selections and pick the leader			0
it ’s the same old @entity3			2
‘ if @entity4 is serious about standing up to @entity20 , he should reopen his inquiry into the @entity1 ’s attempt to fix the @entity3 selection in @entity15			2
if he ’s too weak to govern his party , @entity4 is too weak to govern the country			0
’ a @entity3 source said the bumper payment was a regular instalment of affiliation fees , adding : ‘ these payments are made on a scheduled basis at agreed times throughout the year , unrelated to any other matter			2
’ the source went on : ‘ there is absolutely no link			0
throughout the @entity15 matter our motivation has always been , and will continue to be , to uphold the integrity of the @entity3			2
’ the party faced further discomfort over the @entity15 scandal yesterday after leaked emails suggested @entity3 ’s general secretary @entity75 had struck a secret deal with mr @entity20 to allow the union to sign up new members in the constituency in the run - up to the selection meeting			1
unite is alleged to have signed up a number of local people in @entity15 as @entity3 members without their knowledge			2
the emails show that @entity1 ’s favoured candidate @entity87 , who is employed as office manager for @entity3 ’s former deputy chairman @entity89 , was pushing for these new members to be formally recognised by the party in time for the selection meeting			1
she said a deal had been ‘ agreed ’ between ‘ @entity92 ’ and mr @entity75 for their direct debit details to be collected after the selection process had taken place			0
