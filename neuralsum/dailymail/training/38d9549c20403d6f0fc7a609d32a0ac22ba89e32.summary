months after it revealed it had concealed the sexual abuse of children by priests for decades , the @entity0 has released thousands of more files on about three dozen more abusive clergy members to fulfill cardinal @entity7 's pledge to make them public before he retires			1
the archdiocese first made public files on 30 abusive priests in january , and on thursday it posted the additional files on 35 more on its website			1
altogether , the 15,000 pages of documents outline how the archdiocese dealt with abuse allegations over the past six decades			1

@entity30 said @entity7 did n't want bishop @entity33 to have to deal with the issue when he assumes leadership of the nation 's third largest archdiocese later this month			0
a report provided by the archdiocese to media this week suggests the documents are similar to those made public in january that described how the archdiocese hid the histories of abusive priests moving between parishes , did not swiftly remove the men from the priesthood , and in some cases helped them remain priests for years after allegations against them were deemed credible			1
the files cover more than 350 incidents of abuse since 1952			2
the vast majority of the reported incidents happened when the late @entity59 @entity58 and @entity60 headed the archdiocese			2
@entity7 took the helm in 1997			0
not included among the documents are allegations against former priest @entity64 , whose case could have shed light on how @entity7 handled suspected abuse			2
@entity64 pleaded guilty in 2007 to abusing five children and his case prompted an internal investigation of how the archdiocese responds to abuse claims and an apology from @entity7			0
but @entity30 said the archdiocese is prohibited by law from releasing @entity64 's file because there remains pending civil litigation .			0

the @entity0 revealed in january that they had covered up abuse allegations against 30 priests for decades
on thursday , they exposed 35 more allegedly abusive clergymen who were never reported to *authorities*
