these everyday actions , using ordinary objects , are so common in our lives that our brains skim over the smallest details			0
but what if you held a microscope up to the unseen world ? what kind of perspective would we get on common objects around us ? @entity18 's instrument owners were invited to submit their best images for inclusion in @entity22 promotional materials for its giant screen film ' @entity24 '			1
this view of a cigarette filter , revealing cellulose acetate fibers , was the may winner in the ' around the @entity30 ' category that 's exactly what an annual image contest organised by @entity18 , an @entity33 - based imaging company , alongside @entity22 , aims to find out			1

‘ i was in the garden of my parents ' house admiring the @entity48 , ’ recalled mr @entity44			1
‘ i noticed a little ball hanging from a branch of the tree which was going to be a flower in a few days			2
‘ it seemed to have some beautiful yellow spots into it , so i decided to take it and have a look at it in the microscope			2
