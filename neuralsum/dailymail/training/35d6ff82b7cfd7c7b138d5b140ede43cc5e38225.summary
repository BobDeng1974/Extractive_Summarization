@entity25 owner @entity8 apparently placed a curse on the team during the @entity59 when his pet goat @entity61 was denied entry into @entity4			1
he even asked the owner of the @entity6 , @entity64 for admission			2
@entity64 replied , ' @entity66 in , but not the goat			0
' the story goes that @entity69 became enraged , threw up his arms and vowed , ' the @entity6 ai n't gon na win no more			2

but fan @entity87 also reached for the foul ball , and outfielder @entity88 was unable to make the play			0
