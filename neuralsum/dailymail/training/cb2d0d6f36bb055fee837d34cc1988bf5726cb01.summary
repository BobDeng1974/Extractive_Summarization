and in his conference speech , @entity35 said he wanted to ‘ look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 ’			0
but mr @entity0 said he could ‘ knock both ideas on the head			1
’ ‘ the idea that of that £ 16billion [ welfare budget ] we are just going to scoop out £ 10billion from welfare which will inevitably hit the poorest before asking anything of the wealthiest , no. flatly no. of course not			2
