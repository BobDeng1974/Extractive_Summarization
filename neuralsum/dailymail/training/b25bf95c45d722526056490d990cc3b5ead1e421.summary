by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:10 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 17:37 est , 3 march 2014 this year 's list of global billionaires has revealed that @entity5 made the most money in the world in over the past 12 months			1
@entity8 reports that the @entity11 founder 's net worth nearly doubled , going from 2013 's estimate of $ 15.2billion to $ 28.5billion as a result of the social network 's increasing share price			1
that still was n't enough to earn him the top spot , however , as @entity20 founder @entity19 came in at number one after slipping from the position four years ago			1
@entity36 fashion head turned oil magnate @entity37 who is worth $ 2.5billion			2
@entity39 from the @entity40 who made her $ 1.6billion in online gambling and developed the site @entity43			0
@entity45 's granddaughters @entity46 and @entity47 have been added to the list			2
@entity19 held the title of ' richest man in the world ' for 15 out of the past 20 years , but he was succeeded - briefly - by @entity28 telecommunications magnate @entity26 for the past four years			1
@entity19 , who now spends most of his time in philanthropy , earned his spot back as his net worth increased by $ 9billion to $ 76billion after @entity20 's stock had a promising year			1
that stock jump put him ahead of mr @entity26 who came in at $ 72billion			0
@entity60 owner @entity59 held onto the third place spot for the second year in a row and was followed by investor @entity63 and @entity66 head @entity65 came in fifth place			2
the rest of the top ten show the power of @entity72 family connections , as sixth and seventh place went to @entity74 and @entity75 respectively			2
casino magnate @entity76 came in eighth place , followed by @entity80 heirs - with @entity81 and family coming in ninth and her brother - in - law @entity84 came in 10th			0
their relatives @entity87 and @entity88 also got their own spots on the list , meaning that the @entity84 family was responsible for four of the top 15 billionaires in the world			1
@entity81 's high placement means that she holds onto the title as the richest woman in the world , but that does n't mean that there was n't a great deal of change for women on the list			1
@entity104 of tech : @entity107 co-founders @entity108 , left , and @entity109 , right , came in 17th and 19th with $ 32.3billion and $ 31.8billion respectively @entity110 from @entity111 , $ 6.8billion @entity112 from @entity111 , $ 3billion @entity113 from @entity114 , $ 3billion @entity115 of @entity116 , $ 1.8billion @entity117 owns the @entity119 shoe company that produces @entity121 flip flops , $ 1.5billion @entity122 , the ceo of tech company @entity123 , $ 1.2billion @entity124 from @entity125 , $ 1.2billion @entity126 , fashion designer , $ 1billion more women than ever were included this year , with 172 female billionaires on the list of 1,645			1
that jump marks a 24 per cent increase from last year , as only 138 women were on the list in 2013			1
one of the new female faces was that of @entity31 who is one of the youngest self - made billionaires with a net worth of $ 1.05billion			1
like @entity5 , she was helped dramatically by the fact that the @entity11 share price is now up 130 per cent			2
this year 's billionaire 's list , which is the 28th such issue for the financial magazine , comes on the same day as reports that @entity31 may be turning her gaze from @entity145 to @entity146 there is speculation that she may challenge @entity151 senator @entity150 for one of @entity155 's two @entity154 seats			1
her sizable fortune would make the $ 30 - $ 40million required to win the seat easily within her reach without raising a dime from anyone			0
when @entity163 contacted @entity31 over the weekend , there was no comment			2
however , this morning a source close to her said that ' it is 100 per cent untrue			0
' though the new wave of wealthy technology leaders made their presence known on this year 's list , neither of the @entity11 faces were in the top 20 with @entity5 just narrowly missing the cut off			1
gates clearly led the way with @entity65 not far behind , younger iterations like @entity107 's @entity108 and @entity109 came in 17th and 19th place respectively			2
they were interrupted along the way by @entity179 's @entity178 , who came in 18th place with $ 32billion			1
cover stars : two different versions of the issue were released with @entity31 on one ( left ) and @entity111 founder @entity110 on another ( right ) aside from @entity31 , another first time mention was given to designer @entity126 , whose fortune breached the billion dollar mark after he took his eponymous company public in 2011			1
hard times may have knocked off a few : @entity189 , an oil and gas magnate from @entity119 , was profiled as having $ 10.6billion to his name in 2013 but only $ 300million this year			1
ship - building magnate @entity192 was listed with $ 1.7billion previously but took a hit due to the floundering @entity195 economy			0
mystery money men who could n't be valued : @entity197 , an @entity72 art dealer , is believed to be a billionaire but the value of his collection is unknown			0
@entity202 confidante and convicted sex offender @entity203 was not included			0
his assets - including a $ 50million @entity206 apartment and 100 - acre plot in @entity208 - that could help him reach the billionaire 's club			1
who did n't qualify , even though they 're loaded : @entity8 explained that they do not consider ' royal family members or dictators who derive their fortunes entirely as a result of their position of power '			2
@entity221 president @entity220 and @entity223 leader @entity222 are two such examples , with their murky financial dealings thought to put them above the billionaire mark			0
though he is near the bottom of the list , retail giants were represented well in the top 20			1
between @entity59 , @entity232 's @entity231 , and @entity234 's @entity233 and the four @entity84 relatives , there were seven retail billionaires in the top 20			1
by comparison , there were only six tech billionaires in the same subset , including @entity19 , @entity65 and former @entity242 mayor @entity241			1
@entity8 says a record 1,645 billionaires made the list this year , with an average net worth of $ 4.7 billion			1
that 's up from 1,426 billionaires last year with a net worth of $ 4.2 billion			1
total net worth of this year 's list was $ 6.4 trillion , up from $ 5.4 trillion last year			1
the magazine said that 1,080 of the billionaires were self - made , 207 inherited their wealth and 352 inherited a portion but are still growing it			0
@entity8 said 268 billionaires were new to the list , beating out a prior high of 226 newcomers in 2008			1
and a record number of women made the list this year , with 172 women joining , up 25 percent from last year			1
altogether 100 people dropped out of the rankings , while 16 passed away			0
the biggest loser dropped so dramatically that he is no longer a billionaire			2
@entity189 , an oil and gas magnate from @entity119 , was profiled as having $ 10.6billion to his name in 2013 but only $ 300million this year so he was n't included on the list			1
the @entity72 was the country with the greatest number of billionaires at 492 , followed by @entity272 with 152 and @entity273 with 111			2
billionaires from four new countries joined , adding @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 to the geographic mix. 1			0
@entity19 , $ 76billion 2			1
@entity26 , $ 72billion 3			0
@entity59 , $ 64billion 4			0
@entity63 , $ 58.2billion 5			0
@entity65 , $ 48billion 6			0
@entity281 , $ 40billion 7			0
@entity75 , $ 40billion 8			0
@entity76 , $ 38billion 9			0
@entity81 and family , $ 36.7billion 10			0
@entity84 , $ 34.7billion 11 @entity283 , $ 34.5billion 12			0
@entity231 , $ 34.4billion 13			0
@entity284 , $ 34.3billion 14			0
@entity88 , $ 34.2billion 15			2
@entity233 , $ 33.5billion 16			0
@entity241 , $ 33billion 17			0
@entity108 , $ 32.3billion 18			0
@entity178 , $ 32billion 19			0
@entity109 , $ 31.8billion 20			2
@entity285 , $ 31billion 21			2
