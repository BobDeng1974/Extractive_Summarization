a new antibody injection could ' wipe out advanced cancer ' by rooting out and obliterating tumours , scientists have revealed			0
the research has been hailed a ' tour de force ' , raising hopes the body 's immune system could be trained to attack melanoma , pancreatic , breast and lung cancer			1
the team at @entity14 believe the laboratory - engineered antibodies could eradicate not only primary tumours , but also distant metastases that have spread through the body			1
professor @entity19 , senior author of the study , said : ' the potency is impressive			2
' you actually see tumour eradication			1
' a new study has suggested an antibody injection could ' wipe out cancer ' by rooting out and eradicating both primary tumours and distant metastases , where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body their findings have been hailed a ' tour de force ' , raising hopes the body 's immune system could be trained to attack melanoma , pancreatic , lung and breast cancer , pictured his team concluded their approach differed to other potential treatments that only apply to specific cancers , in that it could target a wide range of solid tumours			1
the process relies on the same mechanism as that which causes animals ' bodies to reject organ transplants , researchers said			1
in both cases , antibodies - molecules that detect foreign substances in the body - trigger the immune system			1
they bind themselves to proteins from the foreign tissue - in this case the tumour - and through the use of signalling cells , alert t - cells , that act like the immune 's system 's swat team			1
when the t - cells come into contact with the ' unwelcome ' tissue , they attack and destroy it			2
researchers isolated the antibodies from mice that were found to be resistant to the cancers			2
they then injected these antibodies , along with chemicals that activated signalling cells , known as dendritic cells , into cancerous mice			0
the mice mounted an immune response and were found to remain cancer - free for more than a year			2
once primed to recognise the cancerous tissue , the t - cells would multiply and not only attack the tumour , but hunt down any metastatic cells travelling through the body			1
the team concluded their approach differed to other potential treatments that only apply to specific cancers , in that it could target a wide range of solid tumours , including melanoma , pictured dr @entity101 , the lead author , discovered both antibodies and the signalling , dendritic cells are both crucial for tumour elimination			1
' within hours after injection , these tumour cells are already coated with antibodies , ' he said			0
he added when the team disabled the antibodies ' ability to bind to the tumours , or the dendritic cells ' ability to ingest the tumours , the t - cells failed to eradicate the cancer			0
' t - cells contain the bullets , but in our system , the antibodies start the whole thing off , ' professor @entity19 , said			0
by adding chemicals that encouraged the growth of the signalling , dendritic cells , to the antibodies , the researchers were able to eliminate six different types of cancer - two melanomas , lymphoma , breast , lung and pancreatic cancer			1
' dr @entity101 was able to show that this combination therapy was extraordinary powerful , ' said professor @entity19			0
' pretty much we could eliminate any cancer			0
' while the researchers tested their process in mice , they said in vitro work with human cancer cells indicates a similar immune - cell response			2
to confirm that , blood plasma from 10 healthy donors was pooled to collect antibodies against four cancers from patients : two lung and two mesothelioma cancers			2
the antibodies with the stimulation factors were able to activate the two lung cancer patients ' dendritic cells in vitro			0
the process relies on the same mechanism as that which causes animals ' bodies to reject organ transplants , researchers said.in both cases , antibodies - molecules that detect foreign substances in the body ( computer generated image , pictured ) - trigger the immune system with the cells from the two mesothelioma cancer patients , the antibodies induced t - cell proliferation in vitro under the same experimental conditions			1
medical oncologist assistant professor @entity181 at @entity14 , who was not involved with the study , called the paper ' a nice tour de force ' and believes the novel therapeutic strategy could utilise the patient 's own immune system to defend against certain cancers			1
he oversees numerous clinical trials involving immunotherapy for cancer patients and thinks an important aspect of the technique is its potential to fight different tumour types			0
he added that given the chemicals used have already been used in other clinical trials , developing them into a therapeutic drug should be ' fairly straightforward '			0
' i honestly think the most important thing is to see if we can bring this new approach into the clinic , ' said professor @entity19			0
' that 's where we want to go			0
' the study was published in the journal @entity210 .			0

study at @entity14 has been hailed a ' tour de force '
@entity215 hopes the body 's immune system could be trained to attack a range of cancers , including melanoma , pancreatic , breast and lung
process relies on the same mechanism as that which causes animals ' bodies to reject organ transplants
expert said results are ' impressive ' , adding ' you see tumour eradication
