a multimillionaire football chairman at the centre of a racism storm has admitted calling @entity5 people ' chingalings ' in a bizzare new interview while trying to defend his actions			1
@entity8 , chairman of @entity9 , is already under fire over remarks he made in another interview where he reportedly said that at some point every @entity13 had called a ' @entity15 '			1
the 78 - year - old is also alleged to have added that ' jewish people chase money more than everybody else			0
he also talked about the high regard in which he held @entity30 people and mentioned how ' two @entity30 boys ' had shown him the ropes in market trading at the end of his playing career			2
however , when asked by the newspaper whether he himself had ever used the term ' chink ' when referring to @entity5 people , he replied : ' when i was growing up we used to call the @entity5 ' chingalings '			1
' we were n't being disrespected ( sic )			0
we used to say , " we 're going to eat in chingalings "			0
' the @entity5 were n't offended by that			0
that was the name everyone in @entity9 called it ( the first @entity5 cafe in @entity9 )			0
' it is now understood that the @entity55 is looking into mr @entity8 's remarks and is deciding whether to take action			2
but his latest comments prompted criticism from the @entity5 community who say the term ' chink ' and ' chingaling ' are highly offensive			2
mr @entity8 had previously come under fire for remarks he made in another newspaper interview while defending the appointment of @entity9 's new manager @entity67 , who is also facing an @entity55 investigation into alleged racist and homophobic text messages @entity70 , a spokesman for the @entity71 told the @entity72 : ' for many in the @entity5 community these words hold deep emotional resonance , as they are often used in conjunction with racial violence , harassment and hate crimes			1
' therefore , to say that " there is nothing wrong " with using such terms or that @entity5 people ' are n't offended ' by their use , demonstrates a dangerous level of ignorance			2
' we have noticed that mr @entity8 has truly gone out of his way to apologise to the @entity30 community , it is a shame that the same level of apology has n't been extended to the @entity5 community			1
' the former owner of @entity94 , who is thought to be worth around £ 200million , has already been asked to respond to an @entity55 misconduct charge over his original comments as he was trying to defend the appointment of @entity67 as the club 's new manager			1
mr @entity8 , who is thought to be worth around £ 200million is the founder of the @entity94 chain and bought his hometown club in february 1995 mr @entity67 is also the subject of an @entity55 investigation into allegedly racist and homophobic text messages sent during his time at @entity107			1
both he and mr @entity108 deny being racist			0
@entity107 owner @entity109 , who sacked @entity67 last december , branded mr @entity8 a ' racist ' following his appointment of @entity67 and subsequent controversial remarks			1
mr @entity8 has said he would resign if the @entity55 ' even suggest i 'm guilty ' of making racist remarks			1
shortly afterwards , two of the team ’s sponsors ended their arrangement with the club , with kitchen appliances firm @entity119 describing its position as ‘ untenable ’			0
but a spokesman for mr @entity8 later said : ‘ the quotes were taken out of context and twisted			0
’ the former @entity126 and @entity127 player bought his hometown club in february 1995 , overseeing an incredible rise from @entity129 to win last year 's @entity130			0
@entity9 currently sit 23rd in the @entity132 standings and have yet to win since their new manager 's appointment .			0
