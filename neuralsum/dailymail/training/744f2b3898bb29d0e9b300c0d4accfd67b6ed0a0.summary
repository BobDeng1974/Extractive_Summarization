@entity0 was on its way from @entity2 to @entity3 on june 16 when crew made the unfortunate discovery			1
their response however has sent the story viral - as flight crew , apparently without irony , placed napkins in the bathroom as a makeshift solution			1
the branded napkins read : ' fly by the tips of your fingers			1
' improvised : @entity9 crew left these napkins ( with an ill - timed slogan ) in the onboard bathroom after they ran out of toilet paper on an 11 - hour flight from @entity2 to @entity3 the picture was posted on the message board @entity35 by someone called @entity38			1
he wrote : ' apparently , they ran out in one lav half - way home and could n't bother to transfer a roll from another			2
' and before you ask , i went back to the lav after i saw this			2
did n't have the phone with me the first time			2
' in a statement , a @entity9 spokesman told @entity51 : ' the aircraft ran low on toilet tissue and our crew improvised and provided customers with paper napkins			1
' we apologize to our customers on this flight for the inconvenience and would like the opportunity to welcome them back			2
' the company came last in a customer service survey released in april			0
uncomfortable : passengers were faced with no toilet paper on an 11 - hour @entity9 flight @entity9 is currently facing a lawsuit filed last month by an 18 - year - old @entity70 high school student who claimd that flight attendants failed to address a passenger who was masturbating in front of her			0
