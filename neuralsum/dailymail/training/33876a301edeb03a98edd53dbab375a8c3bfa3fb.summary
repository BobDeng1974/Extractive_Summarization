by @entity0 published : 16:34 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 19:07 est , 30 january 2014 soaring above a weight of history , the @entity3 squadron has flown its final mission before being disbanded for only the third time in its existence			1
the @entity9 set up @entity3 in 1943 for only one purpose - to carry out @entity11 , breaching dams near @entity14 factories in the dead of night by using experimental ' bouncing bombs '			1
but 71 years , five new fleets of planes and thousands of missions later , the squadron is still at the forefront of @entity23 military operations			1
historic : jets from the famous @entity3 fly from @entity27 , @entity28 , for the final time before it is disbanded for only the third time in its history sunset on an era : wing commander @entity33 , 617 's current leader , told @entity34 : ' there 's a degree of sadness			1
it 's quite a poignant time ' saying farewell : squadron leader @entity40 carries out pre-flight checks before his final flight aboard the aircraft in @entity28			2
they will soon return to @entity45 based at @entity47 near @entity48 , @entity45 , the squadron is about to receive its sixth new fleet of planes , replacing its aging @entity51 with the @entity54 stealth fighter which is due to be introduced in 2016			2
until then @entity3 will be no more			0
yesterday crew members took their last flight aboard 617 's current fleet - from @entity58 in @entity28			1
the air force 's most famous squadron took over aerial reconnaissance there in november and has flown more than 400 missions			2
now its crew members will disperse to join other squadrons or become flight instructors			0
wing commander @entity33 told @entity34 : ' there 's a degree of sadness ; it 's quite a poignant time			1
' i 'm glad we 're able to draw this chapter of this squadron 's history to a close on operations			0
i think that 's fitting			0
' despite the very modern nature of the task in hand , the crew could not forget their past - the image of water pouring from a broken dam is inscribed on their badge			0
weight of history : it is hard for the crew to forget the significance of their squadron number			0
the image of a burst dam is inscribed on their badges in their footsteps : from left , crew members flt lt @entity103 , flt lt @entity104 , wg cdr @entity105 , flt lt @entity106 and @entity107 @entity40 the @entity109 jets will be returned to @entity47 near @entity48 , and @entity3 will reform in 2016 with a new fleet of @entity54 stealth fighters @entity112 now uses tornado jets ( left ) , a leap in technology from the famous bouncing bombs designed by @entity117 ( right ) , who was later knighted born into battle at @entity121 , @entity122 , with just a few weeks ' notice of its star mission , the unit has been through several transformations to keep up with the times			1
it began with @entity129 bombers and received @entity130 the year after the war ended			0
in 1952 defence chiefs provided @entity133 , the first jet - powered light bomber to enter mass production in @entity23			0
the @entity3 then disbanded in 1955 , re-entering service two and a half years later with a new fleet of @entity138 which lasted almost 30 years			1
in 1981 it disbanded again to replace the @entity138 bombers with a fleet of @entity142 jets , which were later upgraded to @entity143			1
although no mission would match the notoriety of the @entity3 , @entity3 saw service for many high - profile tasks			2
it made the first use of the @entity9 's cruise missile @entity149 during the invasion of @entity152 in april 2003			1
vital : the huge dams on the @entity155 protected industrial heartlands for the @entity158 war effort			2
breaching the dams in may 1943 was a crucial blow rushed : dr @entity117 ( right ) had very little time to test his bouncing bomb , which skimmed the surface of the water before impacting low on the dams			2
it was tested off the @entity23 coast in top secret conditions , so confidential that even wing commander @entity169 was not told the full nature of his mission until shortly before the @entity3 was formed on march 21 , 1943 , with wing commander @entity169 tasked to recruit top fliers from other squadrons			1
for weeks not even he was told of the task - only that it was essential to be able to fly low over water			0
they trained by flying over the dams and reservoirs of @entity181 while the bouncing bombs , designed by @entity117 , were tested off the @entity184 coast			0
the crews were tasked with breaching four huge dams on the river @entity155 , the heart of @entity14 industry and crucial to the @entity158 war effort			1
in just a few precious weeks , top - secret tests had shown the bomb had to be dropped at exactly 220mph , 60ft above the water in order to skim across the surface			0
appeal : part of @entity3 's fame can be put down to the 1955 blockbuster @entity199 , which immortalised the raid with the help of the polished glamour of the silver screen			2
right , the squadron 's badge depicting a breached dam with water pouring from it was approved by @entity209 in 1944 , and has remained ever since nineteen modified @entity129 bombers flew into enemy territory on the night of may 16 , with @entity169 deliberately using his own plane to draw away @entity14 aircraft while his team undertook their task			1
eight of the aircraft and their crews were lost , and two of the four dams - @entity219 and @entity221 - were breached			0
upon their return , the crew were honoured for the danger they had faced , the short time they had to prepare and the audacity of what they had done			0
the last surviving member from that night , squadron leader @entity232 ' @entity231 , 91 , recently revealed how he celebrated - with a nice cup of tea			0
the @entity109 jets are now set to return to @entity47 as the @entity3 story fades into memory for another two years , before it rises again , ready to fight another day .			1

the unit is still at the forefront of the @entity9 71 years and five fleets after the 1943 raid on the @entity155 , @entity14
it has flown its last mission from @entity27 before its current fleet of @entity109 jets is replaced
wing commander @entity169 led the unit in spring 1943 with less than two *months* to plan his audacious attack
