high flier : @entity3 ( pictured ) is setting his sights on satellites and wants to use them to get remote parts of the world online			2
the billionaire entrepreneur is reportedly exploring ways to create small and cheap satellites in a project that would pit him against @entity24 and @entity25 he is working with @entity26 , a satellite expert and former @entity24 employee who was involved until recently with developing @entity24 's bid to get less developed parts of the world online , @entity33 reported			1
the race is on to connect the two - thirds of the planet without internet access , with @entity24 and @entity25 both announcing grand plans to roll out access using satellites , drones and even giant balloons			1
mr @entity26 founded @entity43 , based in the @entity44 , which controls a large block of radio spectrum and is said to talking to industry executives – along with mr @entity3 – about plans to launch around 700 satellites , each weighing just 250lbs ( 113kg )			1
the satellites would be half the weight of the smallest kind used at the moment and the constellation would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet			1
the duo may build a factory to make the satellites , either in @entity61 or @entity62			0
two - thirds of the world still remain without internet access			1
@entity24 is planning to change this by launching a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online and now @entity3 and an ex-google employee plan to launch around 700 satellites in an even larger project elon musk wants to use satellites to provide internet access to remote parts of the planet			1
he said to be involved in developing cheap and small satellites with expert @entity26 , of @entity43			2
the duo plan on launching 700 satellites which would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet			1
they would each weigh just 250lbs ( 113kg ) - half the weight of the current lightest commercial offering			2
the duo is considering opening a factory in @entity61 or @entity62 to build their creations for a cost of at least $ 1 billion ( £ 600 million )			0
any satellites produced would likely be launched by mr @entity3 ’s firm @entity92 but there are many obstacles in the way			0
any satellites produced would likely be launched by mr @entity3 ’s firm @entity92 , which has 48 launches planned by 2018			0
last month , the company won a $ 2.6 billion ( 1.6 billion ) contract to develop , test and fly ‘ space taxis ’ for @entity106 in order to put @entity103 astronauts into orbit			0
however , there are many obstacles that need to be overcome before the satellites are deemed a success			0
they are predicted to cost $ 1 billion ( £ 600 million ) to develop and may be able to be launched until the end of the decade , depending on @entity92 ’s schedule			0
mr @entity3 ’s involvement in the long - term is not certain and @entity43 risks losing its spectrum in 2030 too			0
the company currently controls a block of radio spectrum in the @entity123 band , communicating in the microwave range of between 12 and 18 @entity125			0
in june , it was announced that @entity24 is planning on launching a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online			1
according to sources close to the company , it plans on spending more than $ 1 billion ( £ 600 million ) on the technology			2
mr @entity26 was working at @entity24 on the final design of the satellites , which are thought to be small , high - capacity and intended to orbit the @entity137 at ' lower altitudes than traditional satellites '			1
before mr @entity26 left @entity24 , there were reportedly plans to make small , high - capacity satellites designed to orbit the @entity137 at ' lower altitudes than traditional satellites '			1
there is also a project in the world to launch giant balloons to connect remote regions to the internet @entity24 : the internet giant is said to be planning the launch of a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online			1
the project was led by mr @entity26			0
@entity24 is tipped to spend $ 1 billion ( £ 600 million ) on the technology and is also planning on using balloons and drones			1
@entity24 's @entity158 aims to launch high - altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below			1
the helium - filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft ( 15 metres ) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3g - speed internet to remote regions			0
in april , the company also acquired @entity169 , which is building solar - powered drones to provide similar connectivity			0
@entity25 : @entity172 revealed solar - powered drones , satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm 's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries			1
small satellite manufacturers : @entity181 and @entity183 ’s @entity182 are both adept at making increasingly cheap small satellites and have a good track record			2
he only stayed for around one year before leaving to work with mr @entity3			0
sources close to him told the @entity33 that mr @entity26 ’s relationship with @entity24 broke down because he does n't think @entity24 has the manufacturing experience needed for such a commitment			2
if the ambitious project goes ahead , mr @entity3 and mr @entity26 will be competing with established firms such as @entity181 and @entity183 ’s @entity182			0
they will also be going head - to - head with @entity24 and @entity25 too			1
@entity24 's @entity158 aims to launch high - altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below			1
the helium - filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft ( 15 metres ) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3g - speed internet to remote regions			0
it 's hoped that it could save developing countries the high cost of laying fibre cables to get online and lead to a dramatic increase in internet access for the likes of @entity213 and south - east @entity214			1
in april , the company also acquired @entity169 , which is building solar - powered drones to provide similar connectivity			0
@entity25 , meanwhile , has its own drone plans			1
in march , @entity172 revealed solar - powered drones , satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm 's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries			2
in april , @entity24 acquired @entity169 and is building solar - powered drones to provide connectivity			1
@entity25 has its own drone plans			1
@entity172 said solar - powered drones , satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm 's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries he has pledged to work on technology to deliver the internet to ' the next 3 billion people ' - and revealed the firm has hired experts in solar power that can keep drones flying for months at a time			2
the @entity240 's president , professor @entity239 , said : ' the idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old , from low - orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles			0
' ' the difficulty has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost			0
as technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this and @entity25 's intervention in this space is a welcome boost to the area			2
' companies such as @entity25 and @entity24 have a checkered history with privacy , and many have voiced concerns about how the site could use drones to collect data about people			1
in theory , the drones could be used to take aerial images , or collect details about wireless networks and individuals			0
as @entity25 and @entity24 's drones will be used to provide internet to people home 's , there will need to be a limited amount of data collection to connect the homes to the network			1
with this in mind , they are likely to be subject to strict regulation			0
in the @entity103 , for example , the @entity290 's ( @entity290 ) guidelines state private operators are allowed to fly their drones ‘ recreationally ’ and commercial drones are ' prohibited			0
' however , earlier this year judge @entity295 , from the @entity296 ( @entity296 ) dismissed a fine , which the @entity290 had placed on a drone photographer			0
@entity299 said @entity301 ’s camera drone was ‘ not subject to [ federal regulation ] and enforcement , ’ and therefore the fine was n't valid			0
it is unsure exactly what this ruling will mean for companies such as @entity309 , and now @entity25 , but it could see the restrictions relaxed			2
@entity25 and @entity24 are also planning to use these drones in areas outside the @entity103 , and it will depend on the individual country 's laws on unmanned aircraft and surveillance			1
mr @entity3 and mr @entity26 both want to cut the cost of the technology , not least because @entity43 needs a lot of satellites			0
mr @entity3 has an enviable track record of reducing the cost of space travel by simplifying the design of rockets and building components in - house and it is hoped he will help to develop satellites that cost under $ 1 million ( £ 629,008 ) , instead of several million as they do at the moment .			2

@entity333 entrepreneur is said to be working with a satellite expert to develop cheaper and lighter technology with plans to launch a constellation of 700
satellites would be half the weight of the smallest kind used at the moment
