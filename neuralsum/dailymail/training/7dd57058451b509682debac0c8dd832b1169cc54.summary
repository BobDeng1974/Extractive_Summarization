’ @entity3 , who earned £ 140,000 a year plus six - figure bonuses , was fired after being late or absent at least 64 times in two years , the @entity13 heard			1
he is suing his former bosses at commodities firm @entity17 for wrongful dismissal , claiming that socialising with clients late into the night was part of his job			1
the 38 - year - old admitted he enjoyed knocking back up to ‘ eight pints of beer then wine on top ’ , the hearing was told			2
the final straw came when he was allegedly so hungover after drinking until 4.30am on a business trip to @entity29 that he missed three meetings and did not respond to phone calls from his concerned managers			2
mr @entity3 claimed his absences were acceptable given his role in the company and adamantly denied turning up to the office with ‘ red eyes and trembling ’			1
‘ the culture in this organisation is that you can do what you like as long as you make money , ’ he told the court			2
‘ i accept that there is sustained lateness and i am saying that it was accepted because i made money			0
‘ @entity48 was an integral part of entertaining and building relationships with people			0
‘ the picture that you want to paint of me is that i ’m a wanton alcoholic who does n’t care about anything other than drink			1
‘ i ’m not an alcoholic , i do n’t have binge - drinking tendencies and i am quite lucid in a court of law focussing on the issue at hand			2
’ @entity62 , for @entity17 , said : ‘ they fired you because you did n’t turn up for work , for meetings ... you were late , you were drunk			1
’ mr @entity3 responded : ‘ all acceptable as long as we make money			1
this was not a desk , nine - to - five role			0
the point is , nobody raised any issue			0
‘ if you make money you do well – if you do n’t , you get fired			2
’ counter argument : but @entity77 claims he was in fact working hard for the company and that late night socialising with clients were part of the requirements he also claimed that many of his late arrivals at work were due to train delays			1
and he denied claims that he also regularly failed to turn up at his former employer , commodity trader @entity90 , because he was drunk			2
mr @entity62 said mr @entity3 had metaphorically ‘ slapped @entity17 in the face ’ after bosses arranged for him to see medical specialists because they were concerned about his excessive drinking			1
mr @entity3 admitted drinking into the early hours while on the trip to @entity29 in october 2010 , but claimed he had no meetings that day that required his attendance			1
he said : ‘ the reason i was fired was that they needed a scapegoat for the year ’s losses			0
‘ i had been trying to save the year , because the year had been abysmal			0
i was working extremely hard during this period			1
it ’s a results - driven business and i got results so it [ lateness ] was n’t an issue			0
’ his counsel @entity111 earlier told the hearing : ‘ we say the dismissal is a mockery and the whole dismissal process was a sham			0
‘ there was no true or just reason to accuse him of not turning up to meetings when his attendance was not obligatory			0
’ he told judge @entity121 that the married father of three ’s reputation was ‘ on the line ’			0
mr @entity3 , from @entity126 , @entity127 , received a £ 202,000 signing - on bonus in 2009			1
