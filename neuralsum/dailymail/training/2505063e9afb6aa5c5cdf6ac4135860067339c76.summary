a 36st chef who was bombarded with mocking texts about his size from a well - meaning friend has lost a massive 21st in a year - and finally found love			1
@entity6 , 31 , piled on the pounds from the age of 14 , when he started a part - time job in a kitchen and began picking at food all day			1
his weight rapidly spiralled out of control and by his twenties he had ballooned to nearly 36st			2
' the head chef would cook food all day for pub customers and then gorge on fast food for his own meals because he could n't face going back into the kitchen at home			1
to keep up his energy at work , @entity6 guzzled sugary drinks from the bar and ate jumbo - sized packs of @entity35 minstrels in one sitting			1
he had to buy his giant size 7xl tops from a specialist supplier and became resigned to the fact that he would never find love			0
but with the help of some very harsh words from a well - meaning friend , @entity6 started to turn his life around			1
@entity6 's good friend @entity45 , 46 , started to send him texts labelling him a ' fat f * * k ' every day for six weeks , which ended with finally deciding to go on a diet			1
in just 12 months , his weight dropped by almost two thirds , from 35st 10lbs to 14st 4lbs , and his waist size halved from 60in to 32in			1
@entity6 piled on the pounds from age 14 , when he started working in a kitchen and picking at food all day @entity6 would gorge on fast food for his own meals because he could n't face going back into the kitchen at home around the same time he started the diet in january 2014 , he became friendly @entity60 , his neighbour in @entity61 , @entity62			1
@entity6 - who admits he was ' terrible ' with girls - would go to her house during breaks from work at the @entity67 in @entity68 to have his diet milkshake			1
confidence issues meant he never found the courage to tell her how he felt until @entity73 four weeks ago , after he had completed his astonishing weight loss			0
but unfortunately for @entity6 , it looked like he had left it too late - @entity60 , 36 , was preparing to move back to @entity77 , @entity78 , where she comes from			1
for a week and a half , she and @entity6 had a week of uncertainty about their future - by january 11 , she had already packed up her removal van and sent it off on the 200 - mile journey to @entity85			1
it took his well - intentioned friend 's constant reminder of the reality of his size ( left , before he lost weight ) to spur @entity6 into starting his diet ( right , pictured after his weight loss holding a pair of his old trousers ) but as she was about to follow it , she suddenly decided she could n't be apart from @entity6 and instead moved in with him on the spot - exactly a year to the day after he started his diet			1
@entity6 said : ' it was a confidence issue on my behalf			1
i had no luck with girls and did n't think she 'd like me but my confidence changed when i lost weight			0
' i do n't know if she would have wanted to be with me when i was fatter but being more secure in myself definitely made me more attractive as a person			0
' @entity60 , who has a three year - old daughter , said : ' his confidence grew as he lost weight and i was really proud of what he 'd achieved			0
' on @entity73 he told me i was beautiful inside and out			0
' i really realised how much he meant to me when i was moving			0
' we 'd loaded the van up that morning and i was sitting in the house , getting the last bits ready to go			0
' i just said to my friends , " i do n't think i can go " and i said , " i 've got to go and tell @entity6			2
" ' i legged it over to the pub and that 's when i said " i ca n't leave			2
" ' most gratifying of all , @entity6 has now found love with friend @entity60 @entity6 started the @entity127 diet on january 11 last year after his friend @entity128 , a camper van salesman , saw an advert for it in his local gp surgery			1
he was also spurred on by the texts from @entity128 which told him : ' you 'll be dead by the time you 're 40 '			0
@entity6 , who used to feel exhausted and lethargic but is now a bundle of energy , says he feels like a ' new man '			2
he added : ' i just got bigger and bigger as a child , i was never slim			0
' i would combat the embarrassment by laughing it off and i 'd just be the fat jolly one of the group			2
' it took the full six weeks to motivate me to do something but i 'm so glad i did			0
@entity128 has saved my life , i ca n't thank him enough			0
' i never made plans for the future as i always thought i would be dead at a young age , but now i 'm healthy and have an amazing girlfriend - i 'm a new man			0
' @entity6 on his way to losing the weight last summer the one thing @entity6 is frustrated by though , is that he has been rejected by the @entity152 to have excess skin removal surgery			2
he said : ' i 've done the hard work off my own back and the surgery would be a lot cheaper than an gastric band			0
' i see people with boob jobs on the @entity152 and i think it 's unfair that i 've been rejected			0
' however i do understand there are people more in need and i 'm just glad i 'm healthy			0
' the @entity127 diet took him down to just 640 calories a day with his regular meals replaced with milkshakes , soups and bars			2
@entity6 says the diet allowed his brain to ' switch off ' from thinking about food			1
his one normal meal of the day now consists of a low - fat meat from a specialist local butcher with fresh green salads and vegetables .			2

@entity6 , 31 , piled on the pounds while working as a pub chef
but after a friend texted him daily to call him ' fat ' , he began to diet
he then dropped from 35st 10lb to 14st 4lb in just twelve months
