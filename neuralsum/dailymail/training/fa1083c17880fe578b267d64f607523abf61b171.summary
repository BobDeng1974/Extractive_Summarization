the number of @entity2 extremists fighting for @entity3 could double after @entity5 's 15,000 strong offshoot in @entity6 is said to have pledged allegiance to the militant group			1
the merger is believed to have taken place in @entity11 - on the border of @entity6 and @entity13 , where all of the crossings are currently in the hands of @entity17 militia , many of them members of @entity3			1
in april the @entity19 pledged allegiance to @entity5 leader @entity21 , who has previously condemned @entity3 ' brutal attempts to establish an @entity24 state in the @entity25 as too extreme , so the development points to a new split within @entity5 's ranks			1
this would double the number of militants @entity3 previously claimed to have under its command blast : a suicide bombing today at a checkpoint manned by @entity51 security forces in @entity52 killed two members of the @entity51 security forces as well as killing and wounding dozens of others news of the merger between @entity3 and the @entity19 were made by both the @entity59 - based @entity58 and an @entity2 website this afternoon			1
images widely shared by @entity3 supporters online appeared to show @entity19 's alleged leader in the @entity34 region , @entity32 , embracing @entity3 fighters after apparently taking an oath of allegiance			1
@entity21 , the overall leader of @entity5 , has previously disowned @entity3 and proclaimed the @entity19 as its official @entity6 affiliate			1
@entity3 which seized @entity13 's main northern city @entity69 on june 10 , has since marched virtually unopposed towards @entity70 and is in control of major border posts on the frontier with @entity6			1
only today violence continued , as a suicide bombing at a checkpoint in @entity52 killed two members of the @entity51 security forces as well as killing and wounded dozens of others			0
the group also controls large parts of eastern @entity6 , where it has both clashed with rival rebels groups - including @entity19 - and has occasionally fought alongside them			1
@entity83 : the @entity19 ( pictured ) is considered @entity5 's representative force in @entity6			1
it is believed to have between 15,000 and 20,000 active fighters condemned : @entity21 ( right ) , who took overall control of @entity5 following the death of @entity89 ( left ) , has previously disowned @entity3 after branding their brutal campaign in the @entity25 too extreme @entity93 intelligence warned of the growing threat posed by @entity17 insurgents in @entity13 at the start of the year but the advice was ignored , a senior official has claimed			1
the allegations , made by an unidentified official and reported by @entity101 , contradict claims made by @entity93 secretary of state @entity103 yesterday that @entity3 ' growth could not have be foreseen			2
in a briefing , the official claimed the @entity93 had given ' strategic warnings ' to @entity13 about the threat posed by @entity2 groups			1
' we routinely highlighted [ @entity3 ' ] growing threat in @entity13 , the increasing difficulties @entity13 ’s security forced faced in combating [ @entity3 ] , and the political strains that were contributing to @entity13 ’s declining stability , ' he said			1
yesterday @entity103 , who has been in the @entity25 this week , gave an alternative account of the threat , claiming ' people were surprised everywhere ' by @entity3 ' progress in the country			2
the @entity93 and @entity13 did not sign a formal agreement allowing troops to stay in the country past 2011 , so ' we did n't have eyes in there , ' he said			2
' but the @entity13 did n't even have a sense of what was happening [ either ] ' @entity103 added			2
the cycle of creation and breakdown of these loose alliances has complicated the three - year - old insurgency against @entity6 president @entity131 , as rebel infighting led to thousands of deaths and allowed the government to reclaim territory			2
the fact @entity19 has now pledged allegiance to @entity3 almost certainly suggests the latter has emerged as the dominant rebel group			1
an internal report of @entity3 ' activities last year put its total number of fighters in @entity13 and @entity6 at 15,000			1
with @entity19 boasting a similar sized or possibly even larger force , today 's merger could double the total number of militant @entity147 fighting under the @entity3 banner in the @entity25			1
speaking of the merger , @entity149 of the @entity6 observatory of @entity59 - based @entity58 said : ' it is very important because @entity153 is strong in @entity154 '			2
this afternoon @entity13 's prime minister @entity155 rejected calls for a ' salvation government ' to save @entity13 from the growing threat of @entity3			1
speaking in his weekly television address , @entity155 said growing calls for him to step aside to allow others to counter the @entity17 insurgency represented a ' coup against the constitution and an attempt to end the democratic experience '			0
@entity155 's defence of his abilities come in response to appeals - led by the @entity93 - for @entity13 's government to to rise above ethnic divisions and form a united front against rebel forces			2
defence forces : @entity13 @entity175 their weapons in @entity177 , central @entity13 this morning			2
they have volunteered to protect the holy city from @entity3 forces @entity181 : hundreds gathered in @entity184 's capital @entity183 this morning to protest against the @entity17 insurgency in neighbouring @entity13 the developments come as @entity3 continue to try to take control of @entity188 , @entity13 ’s largest airfield - which still contains dozens of military aircraft left over from the @entity93 occupation			1
there are also said to be @entity193 - built surveillance planes and helicopters on the site			0
although the majority of the aircraft are not in working order , many of them could easily be fixed - and with an estimated £ 1.2billion in @entity3 ' hands , the group are more than capable of covering the cost			2
as the country has no real air force , @entity13 officers say without foreign air support they are on an equal footing with @entity3 fighters			1
if @entity3 were able to assemble some semblance of an air force of their own , this would give them a distinctive advantage in the battle for control of @entity13			1
by @entity217 , defence correspondent @entity2 jihadists will sweep through @entity219 as ruthlessly as in @entity13 and @entity6 if the @entity220 fails to ‘ wake - up ’ to the danger , a former head of the military has warned			1
brutal extremists could capture huge swathes of the war - torn country when @entity59 and @entity93 troops leave in december after 13 years of war , said @entity231 of @entity232			0
he said it would be a ‘ tragic waste ’ if insurgents seized control of the battle - scarred nation			0
in total , the conflict has cost 453 @entity59 lives and around £ 20billlion of taxpayers ’ money			0
prepared : a member of an @entity13 volunteer force holds a weapon during training in the @entity248 holy city of @entity177 warnings : a @entity51 peshmerga fighter takes his position behind a wall on the front line with militants from the @entity5 - inspired @entity3 in @entity255 , a town in an oil - rich part of @entity13 general @entity231 , who retired as @entity259 last year , spoke out as fighters for the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) terror group , whose barbaric tactics and cold - blooded executions have provoked international outrage , edged closer to @entity70			1
@entity265 has a current strength in @entity219 of more than 52,000 soldiers , including some 5,300 @entity59 personnel			0
it plans to keep a slimmed down force - including 500 @entity59 personnel - there after 2014 to train and advise local forces			0
but there are fears the reduction in troops will spark a security crisis , raising the prospect of the @entity280 re-seizing power			0
general lord @entity231 warned events in @entity13 could be repeated in @entity219 after the withdrawal of international forces unless the government in @entity286 was given the support it needed			2
he told @entity288 : ‘ we should say “ what do you need ? ” and , collectively with other nations , provide what that is for fear that if we do n't we will see what is happening in @entity13 happening there in nine months ’ time and that will be a tragic waste because it 's not necessary			2
‘ what i am very clearly saying is , please finish off @entity219 properly and meet our commitments made in good faith			0
that may need a bit more than governments are currently contemplating but @entity13 is a wake - up call			0
battle : @entity51 peshmerga fighters behind a wall on the front line against @entity3 in northern @entity13 ‘ i fear what we are seeing in @entity6 and @entity13 could happen in @entity219 next year and the thing we should be focusing on now is containing this crisis			1
’ he said @entity219 forces did not need help from combat forces , but the ‘ more sophisticated parts ’ of an armed forces – logistics , aircraft and command and control			0
general lord @entity231 has said militant jihadism is the ‘ biggest threat confronting the free world ’			0
he said it was vital to give political , economic , financial and security support to countries , such as @entity329 , that were under threat from @entity2 radicals			0
his remarks were at odds with those made by defence minister @entity335 at a conference staged by the @entity337 ( @entity337 ) think - tank on wednesday			0
giving a keynote speech , mr @entity335 said coalition forces had done a ‘ hugely impressive job ’ in @entity219			0
he said it was now a country with a ‘ capable @entity219 security force – able to provide security for their own people … a country that is neither a safe haven nor a launch - pad for those terrorists who seek to attack our way of life			0
’ general lord @entity231 said the crisis in @entity13 had been fuelled by the @entity220 ’s botched attempts to back the moderate opposition forces in @entity6 without providing decisive assistance to toppled president @entity131			2
last year , prime minister @entity358 suffered a humiliating @entity360 defeat over authorising military action against the tyrant			0
the @entity363 said : ‘ if you 're going to act to help a cause in another country , you have to do it properly			0
what we did in @entity6 collectively was enough to keep the war alive but not enough to solve it			0
now it has spread into @entity13			0
’ he also said the invasion of @entity13 by @entity59 and @entity93 forces was a ‘ strategic error ’ directly responsible for the crisis now threatening to tear the country apart			0
he said : ‘ there 's no doubt @entity380 was a very brutal dictator but what it did was liberate a whole load of other forces and we 're seeing that play through today			0
