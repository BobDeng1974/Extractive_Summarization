the girls ’ proud parents , @entity11 and @entity12 , say @entity5 is thriving - and believe she is doing so well thanks to copying her sister			1
@entity5 ( top ) , six , has @entity3 's syndrome and she is thriving with the help of her twin sister , @entity8 , who does not have the condition mrs @entity5 , 35 , said : ‘ children with @entity3 ’s syndrome are very visual and they learn by copying			1
‘ because @entity5 could watch @entity8 reach all these milestones , and then copy her , she has been able to reach them too			1
‘ we could spend hours with a therapist trying to teach @entity5 something , but then all she ’d have to do is watch @entity8 doing it and she could copy			2
‘ there is a special sign language that people with @entity3 ’s syndrome can use , called @entity29			2
@entity8 picked it up easily and was able to teach it to @entity5			2
‘ we always had faith in @entity5 , but @entity8 has made a real difference to her			2
she added : ‘ there are other factors too , and we have excellent medical professionals who work with @entity5 to ensure her progress , but they really do have that twin thing going on			2
’ @entity5 has learned to dance , swim and sing by watching @entity8 but her parents say she does become frustrated if she ca n't keep up with her sister the girls ' parents , @entity11 and @entity12 , believe @entity5 has had an advantage in reaching her milestones because she is able to copy @entity8 when @entity5 was born , her parents had no idea how able she would be			1
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ the doctors are very careful not to say that your child definitely will be able to this , or definitely will be able to do that			0
‘ some children with @entity3 ’s syndrome get on very well in life , while others will have hearing , visual , speech and various health problems			2
‘ it was a just a case of wait and see what happens			0
@entity3 's syndrome is a genetic condition that causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features			1
most babies with @entity3 's syndrome are diagnosed shortly after birth and are likely to have reduced muscle tone , eyes that slant upwards , a low birth weight , a small nose and mouth and short fingers			1
they also have some degree of learning disability but this varies widely between children			0
some children with @entity3 's syndrome also have associated health problems such as heart disorders , digestive problems , hearing and visual impairments , thyroid dysfunction and blood disorders			1
it is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability and around 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the @entity89			0
it is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the baby 's cells			0
currently , no one knows what causes the presence of the extra chromosome but @entity3 's syndrome is more common in children born to older mothers			1
for example , if a woman has a baby when she is 25 there is a one in 1,250 chance of her baby having @entity3 's syndrome , but if a 45 - year - old woman has a baby , there is a one in 30 chance of it having @entity3 's syndrome			1
source : @entity114 ‘ luckily , @entity5 is high functioning , and with @entity8 by her side - plus many experts , doctors and family members who have helped us along the way - she ’s doing really well			1
’ the couple first noticed @entity8 ’s influence on her sister when they were learning to walk			2
mr @entity126 said : ‘ when @entity8 began to crawl , we did n’t expect @entity5 to be able to reach that goal so quickly			1
‘ but when @entity5 started crawling too and becoming more mobile , we realised how important @entity8 was to her sister			1
‘ now , @entity5 sees @entity8 picking up a book to read and she ’s started to do it too			2
‘ @entity8 had swimming lessons and now @entity5 does them too			2
‘ they ’re very close , which is lovely - they both love to sing and dance together - their favourite song is we will rock you			0
it ’s a wonderful thing to see			0
’ mr and mrs @entity5 were unaware that one of their daughters would have @entity3 ’s syndrome			1
it was only when the girls were just a few hours old that doctors diagnosed @entity5 ’s @entity3 ’s syndrome			1
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ i had a normal pregnancy and had no reason to expect anything other than two healthy babies			0
‘ @entity8 was born first and then they gave me @entity5			2
‘ i remember thinking that @entity5 had her eyes shut and that she looked a bit different , but as soon as she opened her eyes i thought she was fine			0
‘ i was a first time mother so i had no reason to suspect anything was wrong			0
‘ then the doctors told me that rather than stay on the ward i could have my own room			0
‘ at the time i thought this was lovely but now i know it ’s because they wanted somewhere private to tell us what was going on			0
‘ at about three hours old a doctor examined @entity5 and asked me if i had ever heard of @entity3 ’s syndrome			1
mr and mrs @entity5 did not know @entity5 had @entity3 's syndrome until she was about three hours old ‘ i said that i had and he told me he thought @entity5 had it			1
he started to point out signs like the extra line on her palm , her small ( almond shaped ) eyes and her low muscle tone and it suddenly became obvious			0
‘ the doctor kept speaking but i felt like someone had put a glass wall between us and i could n’t really see or hear him			0
it was just so surreal , i felt like i was watching a film			0
‘ it was the biggest shock of my life , but as the doctor left us with some leaflets he told me to enjoy my baby - those words really stuck with me and they still do now			0
‘ whenever i find myself getting frustrated i just think back to that moment and i remind myself how lucky i am to have my daughters			0
’ mr @entity126 said : ' when @entity8 began to crawl , we did n't expect @entity5 to be able to reach that goal so quickly			1
but when @entity5 started crawling too and becoming more mobile , we realised how important @entity8 was to her ' @entity5 attends the same mainstream school as @entity8 and the girls ' parents say @entity8 is always there to look out for her sister now , at age six , @entity5 is in mainstream school with her sister			1
her mother said : ‘ sometimes @entity5 gets jealous that her sister can do things easier than she can , but they get on very well			0
‘ they are so close and if @entity5 ever runs into difficultly at school , @entity8 will always be there to help her			2
‘ for a short time another child was picking on @entity5 , but @entity8 stepped in and told the girl how lovely her sister was			1
‘ @entity8 will always find things easier than her sister , but @entity5 is high functioning and she ’s coming on leaps and bounds			2
speaking of the girls ' birth , mrs @entity5 said : ' it was the biggest shock of my life , but as the doctor left us with some leaflets he told me to enjoy my baby - those words really stuck with me and they still do now ' mrs @entity5 said : ' @entity5 is cheeky , funny , outgoing and has a wonderful confidence that we adore - she rewards and touches everyone that comes into contact with her ' ‘ they are just like any other six - year - old girls - they love dancing and gymnastics , and swimming , and they ’re big fans of @entity230			0
‘ they ’re big fans of @entity232 and think they ’re princesses themselves most of the time			0
‘ @entity8 is a very special little girl , and we think she has grown up to be more tolerant , patient and caring than children of her own age			0
