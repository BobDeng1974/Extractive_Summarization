@entity0 claimed a second consecutive @entity2 crown in his final game on @entity5 soil on saturday - but was keen to turn the spotlight on the " incredible " contribution of @entity8 in @entity10 's victory over @entity11			1
@entity12 winner @entity0 landed 13 points with the boot at @entity16 's @entity15 yet felt it was the performance of centre @entity8 that was pivotal to the 23 - 6 win			1
the former @entity20 fly - half , who turns 35 on sunday , will end 17 years of top - class rugby with @entity10 's top 14 final against @entity24 next weekend , and conceded watching @entity8 execute a cunningly - disguised chip that yielded a fine try for the @entity28 playmaker underlined exactly why he will retire this summer			1
' he 's a damn good player who can just about do everything , and he 's the reason why someone like me realises my time is up			2
' you look at him doing what he does , and you think that 's where the future of this team is			2
i certainly want to see him flourish , he 's been an inspiration to me , and i know he will be to this team in the future			2
' since he 's been here he 's done nothing but bring this team up , give them more and make us all better players			2
i would n't survive out there without guys like him , his ability to selflessly do the extra work , take on extra responsibility , make the difficult calls			0
' he could say " that 's not my position , that 's not my job " but he never does			2
there have been times during the season where i have n't made the first few kicks , and i 've asked him to take the next one and he just steps up and does it			0
' he never says anything about it , he just gets on with it , and that 's the kind of guy he is			0
' @entity0 will move straight into @entity10 's backroom staff as kicking and skills coach once he retires this summer			1
the nerveless fly - half 's haul of points on saturday afternoon included a trademark drop - goal off his weaker right foot as @entity10 retained their @entity84 title			1
@entity8 's stubbed chip caught @entity86 cold to allow @entity87 to claim the loose ball and return the favour , with the @entity28 midfielder ghosting home for the game 's first try			1
@entity93 grabbed the decisive score after the break , with @entity11 never able to generate their usual rhythm or power			1
' @entity98 ' : @entity0 kicked 13 points against @entity100 at the @entity15 in @entity16 double : it was the second successive win in the tournament for @entity0 's @entity10 side despite a near - unrivalled professional - era career , @entity0 was once again at pains to shake off the adulation that follows him around the globe			1
' i 've made no secret of the fact i 've been over-supported , i 've been given way too much respect , ' he said			0
' i 've been given too much of an easy life compared to others who have deserved so much more but have n't had it			0
' i 've tried to keep my feet on the ground , otherwise someone 's going to realise i 'm a bit of a fraud			0
' you 're lucky enough to be surrounded by such quality players , and yet it 's not these guys around me that get the adulation and applause			0
' when guys go out of their way to cheer for you , it 's humbling			0
' @entity0 admitted it will be a " pity " not to celebrate @entity10 's triumph in style , with @entity135 's team gearing up for saturday 's @entity137 showdown , a repeat of last year 's final			1
@entity0 said : ' it 's a hell of a day , but a great reward for a long journey for this team			1
and i hope that it can continue for one more week			0
' it 's an experience that will stay with me for the rest of my life : it 's a fantastic present			0
' it 's a pity but we do have to move on very quickly as we have another final to play			1
' @entity11 rugby director @entity150 backed his team to show the resolve required to shake off the defeat and challenge for the @entity155 title in saturday 's @entity157 final against @entity158			1
@entity150 backed captain @entity159 to face @entity160 after continued pectoral trouble , and added : ' one of the great qualities is our ability to respond to the setbacks			0
even if we were playing @entity167 away i would back us to front up , but we 're in the @entity155 final and i 've got no doubt we 'll give a good account of ourselves in that too			2
' @entity159 still has an injury , but he 's able to play with it , and he 'll be able to play next week as well			0
