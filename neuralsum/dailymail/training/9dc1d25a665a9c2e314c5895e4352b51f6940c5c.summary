@entity0 are set to take on @entity1 on monday night in the first super heavyweight clash of the new @entity4 season			1
the two sides filled the top two spots at the end of last season , and after two epic ties between the sides , more fireworks will be expected at the @entity12			0
here , @entity13 runs the rule over the key factors that could determine the result of the game			1
@entity19 ’s men in the middle @entity21 and @entity22 were so strong as a midfield two last season that they allowed @entity0 to play two strikers			1
with @entity28 now at the club , they have more options			0
he is more mobile than @entity30 , so @entity31 can use him and @entity21 to fight @entity1 ’s strength in the middle			2
with the @entity36 boys sweeping up trouble , that leaves @entity22 to go and do some damage further up the pitch			0
but with @entity0 ’s wide men joining the party , expect the midfield to get congested			2
strength : @entity22 was vital to @entity0 's title charge last season addition : whilst new arrival @entity28 should add more defensive resolve to their engine room this time out brace yourself for a fast start			1
@entity0 scored 17 goals in the first 15 minutes of matches last season			2
only @entity1 came close to matching them with 15 goals			0
midfield balancing act without @entity59 , it is going to be interesting to see how @entity1 adapt			2
@entity60 and @entity61 were the standout players last weekend , but @entity63 has a key role to play this season			1
the @entity36 was excellent in the second half of last season and a surprise omission for the @entity69 , though his country has seen sense and picked him for their latest squad			0
his trickery can trouble @entity0 , though that could require @entity75 or @entity76 to sit deep			0
they are naturally more inclined to defend , though @entity76 is better at moving the ball on quickly			0
his quality on the ball could be key in a fiery game			0
standout : @entity60 and @entity61 starred for @entity1 last sunday key role : but @entity63 's creativity could be key to @entity1 's chances this campaign @entity0 more settled with one up top @entity31 went with two strikers for most of last season , but @entity0 played a lone striker home and away against two teams — @entity1 and @entity92			1
@entity31 respected @entity1 ’s attacking style and i expect more of the same tonight			0
with @entity96 out and @entity97 slowly coming back , @entity95 offers the best balance in attack as a lone target man			2
hold - up role : @entity95 could offer @entity0 balance as a lone targetman preference : although @entity31 tends to favour playing two strikers in his team good memories @entity107 will want to draw on last season ’s matches against @entity0			1
@entity1 gave them a scare in a 2 - 1 defeat at the @entity12 and dented their title hopes in their epic 3 - 2 win at @entity115 , only for @entity0 to recover			1
both times @entity0 were tested to the limit and @entity31 ’s side will take nothing for granted			2
@entity120 : @entity107 in discussion with new boys @entity123 ( left ) and @entity124 @entity125 ’s a bonus there is a lot of negativity around @entity125 , but his arrival can energise @entity1			1
you wo n’t have heard many names mentioned more often in press conferences than @entity59 and @entity125 , but @entity107 managed @entity59 well and he can do it with @entity125			0
he is a signing to get the fans out of their seats			0
impact : @entity125 's arrival on @entity140 could energise @entity1 this season 2013 - 14 @entity0 2 - 1 @entity1 2012 - 13 @entity0 2 - 2 @entity1 2011 - 12 @entity0 3 - 0 @entity1 2010 - 11 @entity0 3 - 0 @entity1 2009 - 10 @entity0 0 - 0 @entity1 2008 - 09 @entity0 2 - 3 @entity1 2007 - 08 @entity0 0 - 0 @entity1 2006 - 07 @entity0 0 - 0 @entity1 2005 - 06 @entity0 0 - 1 @entity1 2004 - 05 @entity0 1 - 0 @entity1 city 4 draw 4 @entity1 2			1

@entity0 's midfield pair could determine the result against @entity1
@entity63 could play a key role for @entity107 ' side
@entity95 can play the lone striker role for @entity0
signing of @entity152 will be a major bonus for the club
