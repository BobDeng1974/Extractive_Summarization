@entity7 is a narrow strip of land ( 12 miles long , 3 miles wide ) located about 100 miles southwest of the port city of @entity36			1
like many islands in @entity8 , people digging into the beach there can still find oil from the 1989 @entity36 spill			1
the now abandoned @entity7 city site once was home to 4,000 people , thanks to copper mining			1
the mine closed in 1930 , and now the island is dotted with occasional seasonal cabins and not much else			2
the island is mostly used for subsistence hunting			2

’ @entity122 in @entity123 : even though @entity2 is a resident of @entity6 he has no experience of living along in such a remote location as @entity7 in @entity9 's @entity8 @entity2 said he 'll be safe from the bears			1
he 'll carry a .44 with him at all times , has a shotgun ‘ and a few other weapons , as well			1

there are building restrictions on the uninhabited island , @entity2 said , so he will have to construct his makeshift cabin without digging into the ground for a foundation			1

the challenges do n't faze @entity2 , who is ex-military , except perhaps for one			1
@entity2 will return to civilization in at the end of april 2013 when he will discover for the first time who won the @entity155 election ‘ probably the biggest challenge is the isolation , ’ said @entity2 , adding it was an issue for some of his classmates in an @entity160 survival training course			1
some ‘ did experience hallucinations and even group delusions , just minor things			0
but it is kind of a concern , being alone that long , ’ explained @entity2			2
he said he 's worked with psychologists at @entity169 and the @entity170 , talking through the things he can expect , like nightmares			0
‘ i think i 'll be ok , i 've done a lot of work on my own , and i 'll also have a dog , which probably will help keep things stabilized , ’ said @entity2			2
