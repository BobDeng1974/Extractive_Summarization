but @entity3 is facing problems of its own after gangs of immigrants spent a fifth consecutive night rioting in @entity9			1
officers are battling to keep the capital under control after hundreds of cars were torched , a police station set alight and fire services kept from a major blaze by a stone - throwing mob of youths			1
to make matters worse , rioting has now spread to @entity3 ’s two other major cities , @entity22 and @entity23			1
torched : hundreds of cars like this @entity25 have been set alight in @entity9 during the orgy of violence the disturbances , which have lasted longer than the riots in @entity30 in the summer of 2011 , started last week after police shot dead a foreign - born pensioner who threatened to attack them with a machete			1
left - wing activists came forward to accuse police of racism – a charge strongly denied by the @entity9 force			1
growing unrest turned to violence last sunday in a north - western suburb called @entity43 – where more than 80 per cent of the residents are from overseas , mostly @entity45 , @entity46 and the @entity47			1
trouble then spread to some of the city ’s most deprived areas , shattering the country ’s proud claim that it is a template for a successful and ethnically diverse society			0
no end : police force secure the area as firemen extinguish a blaze in a primary school in the @entity9 suburb of @entity62 as the riots continued for a fifth night on fire : firemen extinguish burning cars in the @entity9 suburb of @entity68 early on thursday night as the fifth night 's violence began documenting horror : residents in @entity68 photograph the burning cars , which were set on fire in a central part of the suburb north of @entity9 on thursday night there were 90 separate blazes in the capital			1
thirty cars were torched and there were eight arrests – mostly of people in their early 20s			2
in earlier attacks , groups of up to 100 rioters targeted schools , nurseries and shops – breaking windows and setting buildings ablaze			2
in @entity93 , south of @entity9 , emergency services were kept from a fire in a restaurant when a gang of youths pelted fire engines with rocks			1
and in nearby ragsved a violent mob set fire to a police station – the second to come under attack in two days			1
destruction : friday morning 's riots , which also saw a second primary school set on fire , resulted in several shops wrecked , multiple vehicle fires across the city fringes and stones thrown at police aftermath : the primary school was completely destroyed by the fire which is being treated by police as arson @entity117 , a @entity9 police spokesman , said : ‘ such fires are mainly lit to lure the police to the scene , who are then attacked			1
’ he admitted officers have been forced to change their tactics , saying : ‘ now if there is a small fire that is not likely to spread , and there is no risk to life , we will send out a patrol and keep an eye on it from a distance			0
‘ but we are not going to bring in the fire brigade unless it ’s really dangerous			0
’ the attacks on emergency service workers have led to private security companies telling employees to stay at home , as mobs have started attacking anyone wearing a uniform			0
several public transport routes have also been cancelled after rioters started hurling petrol bombs at buses			0
@entity9 burning : a car is set ablaze in a suburb north of the @entity3 capital last night chaos : police have been under attack by large mobs , pelting them and fire services with bricks and heavy rocks , preventing them from putting out fires across the city 's fringes the @entity161 and the @entity163 embassy have warned visitors to stay away from certain suburbs			1
government leaders have been stunned by the ferocity of the violence in a country which has long been touted as a paragon of social justice			0
for decades , supporters of multiculturalism have pointed to @entity3 as a classic example of a society which allows immigrants to continue practising their own culture while living peacefully alongside their host communities			2
around 15 per cent of @entity3 ’s 9.5million inhabitants were born outside the country			2
the second largest group of immigrants , after the @entity182 , are @entity183 – numbering more than 125,000			0
former @entity184 total over 160,000 and @entity185 almost 65,000			0
as well as setting cars ablaze , rioters also attacked a police station and a school and nursery the unrest appears to have been sparked after police shot and killed a man wielding a machete on sunday while @entity3 is still relatively affluent , with living standards among the highest in @entity197 , tension has grown in recent years as the country struggles to cope with rising youth unemployment and an ever - growing influx of foreigners			1
unemployment for people born in @entity3 is only 6 per cent , but unemployment among those born outside @entity3 currently stands at 16 per cent			2
the country ’s long - standing ‘ open arms ’ policy for asylum seekers has brought it to a position where it has one of the world ’s highest proportions of asylum seekers relative to its population			0
among 44 industrialised countries , @entity3 ranked fourth in the total number of asylum seekers and second in the number of asylum seekers relative to its population , according to figures from the @entity225			2
the violence has sparked debate in the country on the effect of the government 's social policies policemen secure an apartment building after youths rioted in @entity43 , northern @entity9 government leaders have struggled to explain or control the outbreak of violence , but the anti-immigrant , nationalist @entity238 have soared to third place in the polls			1
the party ’s rise reflects the concerns of many native - born swedes that their country is rapidly changing for the worse			0
@entity3 was ruled for decades by the left - wing @entity249 which has been committed to the creation of an egalitarian society since it was founded in the late 19th century			2
it was ousted from power by the current ruling centre - right coalition , which has failed to make major changes in the country once dubbed ‘ the most successful society the world has ever known ’			0
@entity9 , one of @entity197 's richest capitals , has the fastest inequality rate of any advanced @entity263 economy prime minister @entity264 stressed that everybody needed to take responsibility for their actions if calm was to be restored			2
he added : ‘ it ’s important to remember that burning your neighbour ’s car is not an example of freedom of speech , it ’s hooliganism			0
‘ we have groups of young men who believe that you can and should use violence to change society			0
we can not be governed by violence			0
