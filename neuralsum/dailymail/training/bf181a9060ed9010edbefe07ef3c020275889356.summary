by @entity0 published : 23:45 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 06:59 est , 5 march 2014 @entity2 could be moved from the plains of @entity4 to @entity5 in a last - ditch attempt to save two of their species from extinction			1
black and white rhinos are classed as ' critically endangered ' and are being slaughtered in record numbers for their ivory , with one sub-species , the western black , confirmed as extinct last year but businessmen @entity15 and @entity17 , who founded the @entity5 @entity18 last december , have a plan			1
they are currently in discussions with @entity22 and the @entity5 and @entity4 governments about shipping the animals to @entity25 near @entity26 , central @entity27 , and bred in the hope of creating an ‘ insurance ’ population			1
the white rhino ( pictured here ) is one of two species of rhino that the @entity5 @entity18 are trying to get to @entity5 in an attempt to preserve the threatened species the @entity25 is already home to a small number of black and white rhinos			1
a @entity22 spokesman said the plan was still in its ‘ very early days			0
’ the next step , according to mr @entity15 , is convincing the @entity5 government to relax its strict quarantine laws to allow the animals into the country			0
he said they would then need to convince the @entity4 government to ' loan ' the animals to @entity5 , he told @entity52 ’s @entity54 program			2
2013 was the worst year on record for rhino poaching in @entity4 , with 1004 illegally killed , according to @entity4 @entity57 figures released in january			1
this means nearly three rhinos were poached every day , representing more than a 150 per cent increase on the number killed in 2012 - and a 3000 per cent increase since 2007			2
poaching means white rhino numbers in @entity4 are getting dangerously close to the tipping point when deaths outnumber births , pushing the population into serious decline			2
prince @entity71 recently declared he would like to destroy the royal collection of ivory as a way of taking a stand against the slaughter			0
@entity2 horns , which can earn as much as $ 20,000 per kilogram on the black market , are believed to cure a number of illnesses and ailments , including poisoning , hallucinations , typhoid , carbuncles , cancer , fever , and boils			1
but dr @entity88 of @entity89 told the @entity90 , said : ‘ you would get the same effect from chewing your own fingernails			0
’ the horns are smuggled by transnational criminal networks to markets in @entity97 and @entity98			0
there is evidence of links between the trafficking of rhino parts and other forms of organised crime , such as the trafficking of people , drugs , and weapons			0
2013 saw more than 1,000 rhinos poached in @entity4			2
the white rhino and black rhino are now critically endangered species			0

a record 1004 were slaughtered in @entity4 last year , a 150 *%* increase
@entity124 , which sells for $ 20,000 per kilogram , *wrongly* thought to cure cancer , boils , *hangovers* and *impotence*
