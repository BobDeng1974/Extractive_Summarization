by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 05:12 est , 19 october 2012 @entity2 - controlled robot radiation suits could be used to protect engineers working in the disaster zone around the crippled @entity6 nuclear plant			1
researchers in @entity8 showed of the latest incarnation of @entity10 - a full - body suit that allows wearers to don heavy radiation protection without feeling the burden			1
@entity10 – coincidentally the name of the evil supercomputer in @entity17 's 2001 : a space odyssey – has a network of sensors that monitor the electric signals coming from the wearer 's brain			1
it uses these to activate the robot 's limbs in concert with the worker 's , taking weight off his or her muscles			2
poised : @entity10 on display at the @entity34 exhibition yesterday			1
the new type of robot suits are to be used by workers at nuclear disaster sites and will be field tested at @entity41 's @entity6 power plant @entity42 , professor of engineering at the @entity43 , said this means the 130lb ( 60kg ) tungsten vest workers at @entity6 have to wear is almost unnoticeable			2
he said the outer layer of the robot suit also blocks radiation , while fans inside it circulate air to keep the wearer cool , and a computer can monitor their heart - rate and breathing for signs of fatigue			2
the robot is manufactured by @entity58 , a company unrelated to the fictional firm responsible for the terminator in the 1984 film of the same name			0
@entity10 was on display yesterday as part of @entity34 , which also featured small robots that run on caterpillar tracks designed to move across difficult terrain and gather information in places where it is not safe for humans			1
strong : @entity10 picks up on traces of nerve signals to move in concert with its user , enabling him or her to carry heavy objects more easily , left			1
right , @entity42 , @entity58 president , shows off the pioneering suit @entity58 have developed the technology for a range of purposes , including also as an assistive device for disabled people			0
the company described the suit as a ' cyborg - type ' robot that can supplement , expand or improve physical ability			0
@entity10 works by scanning the user 's skin to detect very weak traces of nerve signals sent by the brain to the muscles via motorneurons			1
based on the signals it receives , the device moves its joints in unison with wearers ' muscle movements , supporting their daily activities			0
nuclear disaster zone : the rubble of the @entity106 nuclear power plant pictured shortly after the earthquake , tsunami and subsequent meltdown that crippled it last year size weight power continuous operating time motions working environment inventor @entity117 of the @entity118 said the devices could be deployed very close to the damaged reactor core at @entity6			0
' we have to think of ways to protect nuclear workers , otherwise @entity6 wo n't be sorted out , ' he said			0
a huge tsunami in march 2011 smashed into the power plant , sparking meltdowns that forced the evacuation of a huge area of northeastern @entity8			0
the decommissioning of the crippled plant is expected to take several decades .			0
