rising heptathlon star @entity0 is relishing the prospect of a future showdown with @entity4 champion and @entity6 team - mate @entity5			1
@entity7 is sitting out the whole of the 2014 season to start a family but @entity0 expects her to be better than ever when she returns to competition next year with @entity12 in mind			1
the 21 - year - old @entity0 has assumed top billing in @entity7 's absence and will focus on claiming @entity17 gold in @entity18 after competing in long jump at this weekend 's @entity21 's @entity20 in the city			1
' @entity36 has the ability to come back and be just the same or better than she was before			0
i think it would be great for heptathlon and the sport and it 's something i 'm looking forward to			0
' she wants to come back for the next @entity44 and @entity45 so hopefully i can keep progressing as an athlete and if i 'm still up there it would be great			0
' @entity0 claimed an impressive fifth place at last year 's @entity44 in @entity50 and has admitted she will go to the @entity51 in the hunt for nothing less than gold			2
and having earned valuable experience when she finished 15th in her major @entity17 debut at @entity57 , @entity0 believes the extra maturity she has gained over the past two years will serve her well			2
flying the flag : @entity0 wants to keep progressing as an athlete and challenge @entity61 ' i went to @entity50 as a junior athlete and on the second day i thought : " oh yeah , i could actually have medalled here , " ' said @entity0			0
' since then we 've all been improving at the same time and i 'm glad i 'm in the mix. i 've got another chance in @entity18 and hopefully the @entity44 in @entity67 in 2017 , so i consider myself a very lucky athlete ' meanwhile @entity0 's @entity70 team - mate @entity69 has withdrawn from the @entity17 in order to fully focus on this month 's @entity72 in @entity73			1
the 17 - year - old , who set a new @entity76 youth record in may this year , has accepted it is best for her development to prioritise the event in the @entity80 , which starts on july 22			0
@entity81 will be replaced in the @entity70 team by @entity83 , who won a bronze medal at the @entity85 in 2010			1
@entity69 said : ' this has been an extremely difficult decision for me to take as i was honoured to be selected to @entity70 , but ultimately it 's right for me and my development to focus on the @entity90			2
' i want to wish @entity83 and the rest of @entity70 all the very best and i 'll be cheering them all on			0
' leap : @entity69 has withdrawn from the @entity17 to focus on the @entity90 nearly there : the 17 - year - old will be replaced by @entity83 in the @entity70 team instead tough : @entity69 admitted it had been an ' extremely difficult decision ' but felt it was right for her development			1

@entity0 anticipates @entity5 makes a comeback after her year out in 2014 to start a family
@entity0 is *seeking* gold from @entity17
the @entity6 team - mates could go head - to - head at @entity12
@entity69 opts out of @entity70 team for @entity17 to compete in @entity72
