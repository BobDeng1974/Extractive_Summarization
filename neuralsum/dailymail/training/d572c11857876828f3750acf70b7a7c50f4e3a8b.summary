by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 07:13 est , 22 june 2012 @entity1 wants the ability to censor the internet - but the @entity4 plans to stonewall the plans at a @entity7 conference later this year			1
@entity1 says it wants wants the right to block access where it is used for ' interfering in the internal affairs , or undermining the sovereignty , national security , territorial integrity and public safety of other states , or to divulge information of a sensitive nature '			1
the member nations of the @entity7 will gather this december to create a treaty for the @entity20 on @entity21 - and @entity1 has already made it clear which way it wants the internet to develop			1
@entity1 president @entity25 has long called for a centralised control of the internet			1
internet block : president @entity25 , right , pictured taking part in a wreath laying ceremony this morning , wants centralised control of the web the @entity4 delegation has vowed to block any proposals from @entity1 and other countries that they believe threaten the internet 's current governing structure or give tacit approval to online censorship			1
but those assurances have failed to ease fears that bureaucratic tinkering with the treaty could damage the world 's most powerful engine for exchanging information , creating jobs and even launching revolutions			2
examples of where the internet has acted as a voice for change include when social networks played a key role in the @entity60 uprisings that last year upended regimes in @entity62 and @entity63			2
the wording of @entity1 's provision for the treaty allow a country to repress political opposition while citing a @entity7 treaty as the basis for doing so			1
the provision also appears to contradict @entity72 of the @entity7 @entity73 , which says people shall have the right to access information ' through any media and regardless of frontiers			1
' an amended treaty would be binding on the @entity4 if it is ratified by the @entity80			1
but approval is not automatic			0
the treaty is sure to be scrutinised by lawmakers wary of its potential impact			2
the @entity7 's @entity86 , which oversees the treaty , does not operate like the @entity88 , where the @entity4 has the power to veto resolutions to which it objects			1
the @entity86 works on a consensus basis			0
proposals can be stopped from serious consideration if enough countries voice their objections			1
a global concern : protesters from the @entity100 group in @entity101 of hackers wear @entity104 masks as they protest against laws they say gives the government control over internet usage more than 190 nations will attend the @entity110 conference and the @entity4 delegation is seeking support for its positions at the preparatory meetings that will continue until the conference convenes			1
' it is important that when we have values , as we do in the area of free speech and the free flow of information , that we do everything that we can to articulate and sustain those values , ' @entity117 , deputy assistant secretary of state and @entity4 coordinator for international communications and information policy , said in an interview			1
the drafting and debating of proposals in preparation for the @entity110 conference have taken place largely behind closed doors			2
public interest groups have criticised the process and said it runs counter to development of sound public policy			0
in response to calls for transparency , two research fellows at @entity141 's @entity140 launched the website @entity146 earlier this month as a way to make documents that have been leaked to them by anonymous sources available publicly			2
the negotiations have sparked rumors that the @entity7 and the @entity86 are plotting to take control of the internet from the loose coalition of nongovernmental organizations that establishes @entity154 policies , standards and rules , they said			1
tents and protesters during a sit - in against the delay of the @entity62 presidential results and the military rulers , today : protesting would be much harder with a censored web the @entity86 's secretary general , @entity168 , has called the takeover rumor ' ridiculous			2
' the @entity86 said the preparatory process is open to all member states as well as hundreds of private sector and academic organizations			0
the member states , not the @entity86 , determine the rules of participation and are free to share documents and information as they see fit , the agency said in an emailed statement			2
several lawmakers questioned @entity117 , who also testified , and @entity182 about the relationship between @entity1 president @entity25 and @entity168 , the @entity86 's secretary general			1
their fear is that @entity25 , who long has pushed for centralised control of the @entity154 , will use his allegedly close ties to @entity168 to accomplish that goal			1
@entity168 , a native of @entity189 , received advanced degrees in electronics and telecommunications from universities in @entity194 and @entity195			0
' is this relationship a concern ? ' asked @entity198 rep. @entity198 , the subcommittee 's chairman			0
' what steps are we taking to be able to counterbalance that relationship ? ' @entity117 told @entity198 he has no doubts about @entity168 's honesty and fairness			0
but @entity182 struck a more ominous tone			0
@entity25 's ' designs ' need to be taken very seriously , he said , and urged proponents of internet freedom to be on guard for ' camouflaged subterfuge ' that could threaten the @entity154 's future			1
the treaty , known formally as the @entity214 , was developed in 1988 to deal with global telephone and telegraph systems that were often state - run			2
the conference in @entity110 , which is being held by the @entity86 , will be the first time in 20 years that the treaty is being opened for revisions			1
independent organizations , including the @entity222 , the @entity223 and the @entity224 , for years have served as the @entity154 's governing bodies			2
they handle core tasks like network and domain name administration and make decisions based on input from the public and private sectors			0
this system allows the @entity154 to evolve organically and rapidly to changes in technology , business practices and consumer behavior , according to open @entity154 advocates			0
yet countries still grappling with how communications have been transformed by the @entity154 view the @entity86 and the treaty as the best avenues for plugging themselves into the global information economy			1
for developing nations that do n't have an effective broadband infrastructure , bureaucratic and regulatory measures can allow them to benefit financially from the traffic that crosses their borders			0
but treaties are static instruments that often are unable to adapt and adjust to the fast pace of @entity154 innovation , said @entity255 , senior manager for public policy at the nonprofit @entity222			0
' further , we do not believe that we should simply take the 1988 regulatory model that applied to the old telephone system and apply it to the @entity154 , ' she said			0
a proposal offered by a @entity262 association of telecommunications network operators would put pressure on content providers such as @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268 to offset the costs of delivering internet traffic to end - users			0
traffic increasingly includes bandwidth - hungry video , and the proposal from the @entity275 essentially argues that the investment needed to expand and improve the transfer of data should be borne by the operators and the content providers			0
@entity117 called the proposal unworkable and said it would have unintended consequences , such as blocking @entity283 , @entity284 and other universities from putting courses online at no cost to users in places where access to education is already limited			0
' if it became necessary to pay in order to make these courses available , they would predictably become less available , which would be very unfortunate , ' he said			0
the threat to internet freedom wo n't come in the form of a ' full - frontal assault , ' @entity182 , a @entity297 member of the @entity298 , said at a congressional hearing last month , ' but through insidious and seemingly innocuous expansions of intergovernmental powers			0
' his warning resonated with members of the @entity310 communications and technology subcommittee .			0
