by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 06:51 est , 11 october 2013 a panicked father had to resuscitate his new born son when he momentarily stopped breathing after delivering him in a car at the side of the road ... just minutes from a community hospital			1
despite pleading with a 999 operator for help , @entity8 , 25 , was told ' nobody ' at the hospital could come to his aid as his new baby struggled to breathe			1
mr @entity8 was driving his partner @entity15 , 23 , to @entity16 after she went into labour with her second child @entity18			1
@entity8 was forced to give newborn son @entity18 , mouth - to - mouth after stopping minutes away from a nearby hospital			1
he was forced to deliver the baby , pictured with mother @entity15 and sister @entity23 but by the time the pair , from @entity26 in @entity27 , reached nearby @entity28 , the baby had almost arrived			2
mr @entity8 was left with no choice but to pull over and call an ambulance and begin to deliver the baby himself - despite being painstakingly close to another hospital , @entity32			1
the panicked father assumed someone from the hospital could come to the family 's aid			2
the 999 operator told mr @entity8 she would call the hospital for help			1
but when she came back on the line , the woman told terrified mr @entity8 : ' nobody can help you			1
' parked less than five minutes walk from the hospital , mr @entity8 was forced to deliver his son in the front passenger seat of their @entity48			1
as little @entity18 , who weighed 9lb 4oz , arrived his father feared he had stopped breathing so administered life - saving mouth - to - mouth resuscitation			1
he said it is ' disgusting ' that staff at the nearby hospital - which does not have a maternity department - failed to come to his family 's aid			1
the couple were en route to the @entity16 when baby @entity18 made his sudden arrival mr @entity8 said : ' i delivered the baby while i was on the phone to the ambulance lady			1
' she said she would ring through to the @entity32 in @entity28 but she came back on and said " nobody can help you "			0
' it ’s disgusting , really - it did n’t have to be a midwife , a doctor could have come out or just anybody with some towels , they would have known more than me - but nothing			2

' i was panicking and the lady on the phone talked me through what to do			0
he started crying and then he stopped			0
i had to do it again			0
' it was all very scary			0
it ’s not something you can prepare yourself for			0
' @entity18 was born at 3.28pm on september 24 - six minutes before an ambulance arrived			1
he was taken with his parents by ambulance to @entity16 and is now back at home with his older sisters , @entity23 , two and @entity93 , five			2

' twenty minutes later i had four contractions in five minutes			0
i rang back and they told me to go through			0
' services at @entity104 are provided by @entity105 and @entity16 and @entity106			0
