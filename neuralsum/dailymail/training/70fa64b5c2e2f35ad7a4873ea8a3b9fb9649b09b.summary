by @entity0 and @entity1 suspended but not struck off : dr @entity2 , 52 , with new husband @entity3 , 66 , pictured together today , who got together just days after his wife , her patient , died of cancer a gp who began an affair with the husband of one of her patients just days after his wife died from cancer has been banned from practising medicine for six months			1
dr @entity2 sobbed yesterday at the verdict , as she was branded ‘ entirely selfish ’ and told to ‘ reflect on her behaviour ’			2
dr @entity2 had been a regular visitor to @entity21 , 69 , in the days leading up to her death , but within two weeks she had moved in with 66 - year - old widower @entity3			1
the couple married in september			0
lawyers for the mother - of - three argued she should escape punishment usually targeted at doctors who prey on vulnerable patients to satisfy their own sexual appetite			0
yesterday , however , the 52 - year - old gp was handed the six - month ban – just a step down from being struck off			2
afterwards the dead woman ’s brother – who previously branded the affair a ‘ betrayal ’ of her memory – told the @entity36 that dr @entity2 had brought her professional disgrace upon herself			2
‘ the past 20 months since my sister died have been extremely difficult for the family and particularly for our 91 - year old mother , who is in poor health , ’ @entity39 , 59 , said			0
‘ dr @entity2 ’ actions and those of @entity3 have been entirely selfish , with no thought for the effect they had on the other members of @entity21 ’s family			1
’ thanking the @entity53 for its ‘ thorough investigation ’ of the case , he added : ‘ i feel a sense of satisfaction that the behaviour of dr @entity2 and @entity3 have been exposed to the public at large and without the work of the @entity53 this would not have been possible			1
’ dr @entity2 was working at the @entity63 surgery in @entity64 when mrs @entity21 went for a consultation in may 2011 complaining of dizziness			1
she was later diagnosed with lung cancer			2
tragic : @entity21 , late wife of @entity3 , who was treated by dr @entity2 as she died of a terminal illness last year over the following ten months , dr @entity2 made regular trips to the couple ’s home , up until @entity72 ’ death in march last year			1
within two weeks dr @entity2 had left her teacher husband and was sharing the marital bed , agreeing to marry mr @entity3 days later			1
dr @entity2 informed partners at her practice that she was in a relationship with mr @entity3 , who was a patient there but had n’t been treated by her			1
she resigned after they accused her of breaching conduct guidelines and the case was referred to the @entity53			0
risk : the doctor knew she faced possible censure from her colleagues and the governing body but was prepared to do so to be with mr @entity3 treatment : dr @entity2 was a doctor at @entity89 in @entity64 when mrs @entity21 was diagnosed with cancer request : dr @entity2 called the @entity53 herself to discuss the implications of her relationship earlier this year the @entity94 ruled she was guilty of misconduct because she ‘ transgressed fundamental rules governing the doctor - patient relationship ’			1
the @entity53 , represented by @entity98 , had called for the doctor to be struck off			0
but at yesterday ’s hearing in @entity102 , panel chairman @entity100 said dr @entity2 presented no risk to patients and would be unlikely to repeat her behaviour			2
however , he rejected submissions that the earlier ruling was punishment enough and suspended her from practising for six months			0
the suspension was postponed for four weeks so she could complete a stint as locum at another surgery in @entity64			0
mr @entity100 said that as well as showing her actions were considered unacceptable , a six - month suspension would give her ‘ the opportunity to reflect further on your conduct and the standards of behaviour expected of you as a medical professional ’			0
afterwards dr @entity2 told the @entity36 : ‘ i accept the outcome graciously as a professional lady			2
’ she declined to comment further			0
following the original hearing , the @entity36 told how @entity72 ’ family had slammed the ‘ indecent haste ’ with which the couple began their relationship			0
her first husband , who did n’t want to be named , claimed she left him , taking their two daughters with her , because mr @entity3 was ‘ younger , had a degree , a good job and money ’			1
he added : ' hurtful comments made by dr @entity2 that we were not a close family only added to our pain as did those made by @entity21 ’s first husband , who took the opportunity of this case to make a series of unfounded allegations against @entity21			1
‘ this action says more about his own bitterness			0
i had hoped he would find solace in his subsequent marriages but this has clearly not been the case			0

@entity21 from @entity64 died from terminal lung cancer in march 2012
within two weeks her husband @entity3 had moved in with her gp dr @entity2 and they *quickly* became *engaged*
the pair married a year later and live in the home mr @entity3 shared with his deceased wife
she is suspended for six months but *avoids* being struck off *permanently*
