but many homeowners are taking to storing more than just dairy products and meat in the fridge			2
a survey by fridge manufacturers @entity26 has found that @entity5 are becoming obsessed with storing items in the fridge that simply do n't need to be there , including nail varnish and paint			1
researchers asked 4,000 homeowners what they keep in their fridge and found that a staggering 26 per cent are storing medicines there			1
more bizarrely still , six per cent store glue alongside their milk and butter , with a further three per cent keeping nail varnish there and one per cent using the storage space for batteries			0
as well as some rather outlandish products being kept in the chiller , @entity5 are keeping slightly less obvious food stuffs that need n't be kept cool in the fridge and may even damage their shelf lives			1
according to top chef @entity54 , storing certain vegetables , fruits and grocery goods can be detrimental to their taste			1
he told @entity56 : ' people keep far too much in their fridge , and it is normally a complete mess			0
' they 've got into the habit of refrigerating absolutely everything when often there is simply no need			0
bizarre : more people are keeping things like paint and nail varnish in the fridge ' we assume a product is always better kept chilled than at ambient temperature , and in the case of protein and dairy that is true , but there are many products that are better kept out			2
' according to @entity54 , tomatoes should n't be chilled because it spoils their flavour by damaging the membranes in the fruit 's walls			0
similarly , citrus fruits shrivel and go tough and potatoes taste is spoiled as their starch turns to sugar			1
although @entity54 recommends keeping soft herbs and spinach , both liable to wilt , in the fridge , root vegetables like carrots are best kept in a cool part of the kitchen			0
warning : tv chef @entity54 gave his advice on what should be kept cool and what should n't damages the taste : the flavour of tomatoes can be impaired if they are kept in the fridge overcrowding a fridge also leads to more food being wasted , says @entity104 chef @entity103 , who puts it down to laziness - people are buying too much in one go			2
@entity108 , head chef at west @entity112 's @entity111 - starred @entity110 restaurant said that her fridge contains things like jams and chutneys - products that have enough sugar in them to act as natural preservatives			0
she believes that part of the problem is manufacturer 's over-cautious advice and our obsession with use - by dates			0
not to be chilled : lemons are better off kept out of the fridge top chefs have said that we risk damaging the shelf life and quality of some of our foods by keeping them in the fridge			1
so what is more at home in the cupboard than the chiller ?			0

a survey by @entity26 found that @entity5 are storing bizarre items in the fridge
