a care home where vulnerable patients were subjected to horrifying ‘ institutional abuse ’ put shareholder profit ahead of the ‘ humane delivery of treatment ’ , a devastating report found yesterday			1
an independent inquiry into the @entity9 scandal also revealed that residents of the home attended accident and emergency departments 76 times in three years – yet no medics alerted the authorities			1
the report lambasted the local @entity18 , police , and health watchdogs for not acting on dozens of complaints by patients and their families dating back up to five years			2
this poor woman was dragged across the floor in this undercover footage obtained by a whistleblower disgusting : staff played games with the patients , shown here placing one person under furniture with the other sat in the seat above			0
campaigners have warned that another scandal like this could happen again but some of the most scathing criticism was reserved for @entity44 , the firm which owned the home – and was paid £ 3,500 a week by the @entity18 for every mentally ill patient placed in the home , which is technically classed as a secure hospital			0
the report , by independent expert dr @entity50 , said the company ‘ appears to have made decisions about profitability , including shareholder returns , over and above decisions about the effective and humane delivery of assessment , treatment and rehabilitation ’			1
it said @entity64 – which is owned by a @entity66 private equity group – ‘ took the financial rewards without any apparent accountability ’			0
dr @entity50 said : ‘ unwittingly , the hospital has become a case study in institutional abuse			1
’ the report was commissioned after @entity9 , which was on a business park outside @entity73 , was exposed by @entity74 ’s @entity26 last year			1
an undercover reporter recorded secret footage of patients being abused by carers			0
the video appeared to show sickening scenes of vulnerable residents being pinned down , slapped , doused in water and taunted			2
since the broadcast , @entity64 has closed @entity9 , at @entity9 in @entity84 , and two other of its string of residential homes in the @entity88			1
on monday , @entity89 , 29 , became the 11th ex-member of the home ’s staff to admit offences relating to the ill - treatment of patients			2
they will be sentenced at @entity97 at a later date			0
yesterday ’s report laid bare the catalogue of failings which allowed the abuse to go unchecked for years			1
between january 2008 and may 2011 , residents at @entity9 were taken to hospital 76 times – including to be treated for epileptic seizures , injury , self - harm , lacerations , removal of a foreign body and for a fall			1
abusers : ( left to right ) @entity113 , @entity89 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			0
( @entity117 left to right ) @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123			0
horrific : this member of staff stamps on the patients hand in yet another shocking image from the now - closed home			2
the private hospital should have been a safe place for patients to be treated with compassion and care but the report said : ‘ putting to one side emotional , verbal and psychological harm … there was considerable visible , physical and quantifiable violence at @entity9 for which patients required hospital treatment and yet there were no safeguarding alerts from accident and emergency			1
’ brave : the abuse at @entity9 was uncovered after this whistleblower spoke out meanwhile , @entity148 received 27 allegations of abuse by staff to patients at the hospital , ten allegations of patient - on - patient assaults and three family - related alerts			1
@entity157 and @entity158 recorded 29 incidents – including nine carer - on - patient incidents			2
these included staff head - butting and punching patients			0
@entity64 itself recorded a total of 379 physical interventions – such as restraint – during 2010 and 129 for the first three months of 2011			0
yet it was only after the @entity26 investigation that the authorities woke up to the true scale of the abuse			2
complaints had either been viewed in isolation , or the authorities had sided with the accounts given by staff rather than patients			0
dr @entity50 said the ‘ silencing ’ of complaints by the victims was ‘ scandalous ’			0
@entity183 , chairman of the @entity184 , expressed the ‘ deep regret ’ of the organisations that make up the board for what happened at the home			0
a @entity44 spokesman said : ‘ we believe we have responded [ to the criticisms in the report ] in a way that demonstrates our resolve to ensure that the events of @entity9 will not be repeated			1
’ failure : the local primary care trust said many of the systems that could have stopped the shocking abuse of patients at @entity9 hospital failed but insisted standards had now improved			1

@entity9 condemned by an independent inquiry for putting profitability before care
residents attended @entity210 76 times , yet no medics alerted the authorities
