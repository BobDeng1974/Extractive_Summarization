by @entity0 published : 13:08 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 15:08 est , 1 may 2013 a wealthy @entity2 oligarch has lost a bitter legal battle against his ex-wife to win a 50 per cent share of her £ 40million @entity7 home			1
@entity8 has been involved in a lengthy court fight to gain what he claimed was his share of the house he and @entity14 bought in @entity15 , @entity16 , through an offshore trust account in 2000			1
the pair bought the home in the capital 's second most expensive street for just £ 6million and spent another £ 1.5million converting it from four luxury apartments to a lavish family home			1
legal battle : @entity27 and @entity14 have been embroiled in a lengthy @entity29 row over the right to her £ 40million @entity7 mansion but despite the value of the property rocketing in the ensuing decade leading up to the couple 's acrimonious divorce , mr @entity32 will not see a penny of the pair 's investment			1
a @entity29 ruling emphasised that the super-rich must live with the consequences if they choose to own their homes through offshore trusts			0
successful investor and former @entity2 politician mr @entity32 and his wife , who set up a chain of exclusive health clubs in her native country , bought the house when mrs @entity14 wished to relocate to @entity7 to give 14 - year - old son @entity53 a top - class @entity55 education			1
the investment vehicle , owned by a @entity58 's trust - dubbed the ' @entity57 ' after their son - is said to have been set up for the benefit of the couple and their children			0
mrs @entity14 lived at the house with her son and her husband was a regular visitor with the pair having another child , @entity69 , in 2003			1
but battle lines were drawn over ownership of the house when the couple divorced in 2009			1
mrs @entity14 - who was named as ' settlor ' of the trust - exercised her right to get her husband excluded as a beneficiary so that he had no interest at all in the house			2
exclusive district : the value of the property rocketed after the couple bought the @entity16 house in 2000 but mr @entity32 has fought his ex-wife ’s move every inch of the way , insisting that he is entitled to a half - share of the property			1
he has also launched proceedings in the @entity58 in which he is seeking reinstatement as a beneficiary of the trust			0
under @entity2 family law , he insisted that - regardless of the trust - he should be recognised as 50 per cent beneficial owner of the house as the couple ’s joint money had been used to buy it			2
however , dismissing his pleas , @entity100 said that mr @entity32 had consented to the creation of the trust with his eyes open and was bound to suffer the consequences			0
the judge , sitting with @entity107 and @entity108 , acknowledged that mr @entity32 did not know the finer details of the trust and did not realise that his rights as a beneficiary could be ' extinguished ' on his wife ’s say - so			0
hearing : a ruling at the @entity29 today emphasised that the super-rich must live with the consequences of buying property through overseas trust funds but he was aware that the house was being bought through a trust and that the ownership structure was inconsistent with straightforward @entity2 law principles of joint family property			2
he knew enough about what was happening to give his ' effective consent ' to it , the judge ruled			0
ruling that mr @entity32 ’s arguments were simply ‘ wrong ’ under both @entity55 and @entity2 law , the judge said he had in any event left it too late to challenge the ownership structure			0
after an earlier hearing in the dispute , high court judge , mr @entity134 , accepted that mr @entity32 ’s exclusion from any interest in the house ' may seem harsh ' , as much of the money used to buy it having been generated from his business			0
however , he said it had never been mr @entity32 ’s intention to use the house as his primary home and his ex-wife ’s continued occupation of the house , with their children , was consistent with the former couple ’s intentions at the time of the purchase .			2

@entity27 and @entity14 bought the @entity16 home in 2000
its value rocketed from £ 6million to an estimated £ 40million today
the couple divorced in 2009 and have fought over the house since
