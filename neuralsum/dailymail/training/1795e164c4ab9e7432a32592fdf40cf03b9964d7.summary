by @entity0 and @entity1 the rate of alzheimer 's disease and other dementias is falling in the @entity6 and some other rich countries , new research shows			2
an @entity6 over age 60 today has a 44 percent lower chance of developing dementia than a similar - aged person did roughly 30 years ago , the longest study of these trends in the @entity6 concluded			1
dementia rates also are down in @entity17 , a study there found			1
however , the epidemic is still growing simply because more people are living to an old age			0
good news : the rate of alzheimer 's disease and other dementias is falling in the @entity6 and some other rich countries , new research shows ( stock photo ) ' for an individual , the actual risk of dementia seems to have declined , ' said dr. @entity28 , a @entity29 expert on aging who discussed the studies tuesday at the @entity32 in @entity33			2
he said the decrease is probably due to more education and control of health factors such as cholesterol and blood pressure			1
the opposite is occurring in some poor countries that have lagged on education and health , where dementia seems to be rising			1
more than 5.4 million @entity6 and 35 million people worldwide have @entity45 's , the most common form of dementia			2
it has no cure and current drugs only temporarily ease symptoms			0
a drop in rates is a silver lining in the so - called silver tsunami - the expected wave of age - related health problems from an older population			1
@entity45 's will remain a major public health issue , but countries where rates are dropping may be able to lower current projections for spending and needed services , experts said			2
recent studies from the @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 have suggested a decline , and the new research extends this look to some other parts of the world			0
decline : the federally funded @entity75 study , pictured , tracked new dementia cases among several thousand people 60 and older in five - year periods starting in 1978 , 1989 , 1996 and 2006 and noted a decline in the @entity6 , the federally funded @entity75 study tracked new dementia cases among several thousand people 60 and older in five - year periods starting in 1978 , 1989 , 1996 and 2006			1
compared with the first period , new cases were 22 percent lower in the second one , 38 percent lower in the third and 44 percent lower in the fourth one			1
the average age at which dementia was diagnosed also rose - from 80 during the first period to 85 in the last one			2
during that time , there were declines in smoking , heart disease and strokes , factors linked to dementia , and a rise in the number of people using blood pressure medicines and getting a high school diploma , which reduce the likelihood of developing the condition			1
' the results bring some hope that perhaps dementia cases might be preventable , or at least delayed ' by improving health and education , said the study leader , @entity105 of @entity106			1
@entity107 , epidemiology chief at the @entity108 , agreed			0
' for those who get the disease , it may come later in life , which is a good thing			0
getting the disease in your 80s or 90s is a very different than getting it in your early 70s , ' he said			0
in @entity17 , researchers from the @entity121 say that claims data from @entity17 's largest public health insurance company suggest that new cases of dementia declined significantly between 2007 and 2009 in men and women			2
women vs men : the study found the decline in dementia rates was more prevalent in women than men dementia prevalence - the proportion of people with the disease - also declined dramatically in women ages 74 to 85			1
there was a trend toward a smaller decline in men but the difference was so small researchers could n't be sure of it			0
the trends corresponded with fewer strokes and better treatment of high blood pressure , cholesterol and diabetes , and more education , they said			1
in @entity152 and @entity153 an updated study of dementia prevalence by @entity155 in 2009 concludes that its previous estimates for the disease worldwide were too low			0
the group now says dementia prevalence appears to have increased from about 5 percent to about 7 percent in @entity152 , and in @entity153 from between 2 percent and 4 percent to nearly 5 percent			0
the estimates were revised based on studies in @entity162 and @entity153 , and the latest @entity164 population projections			0
in @entity167 , researchers from the @entity166 in @entity167 used current population and other sources of information to update a 20 - year - old study on dementia and determined that current projections might underestimate dementia cases by up to 50 percent			1
in countries where dementia appears to be declining , the rise in obesity and diabetes threatens to undo progress			0
' it may be that what we have now is a sweet spot , ' where people with these problems are still relatively young , said @entity107 , of the @entity108			0
' they 're not in the dementia range yet , but what 's going to happen ? we know they 're all in the pipeline			0
