by @entity0 published : 06:19 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 05:17 est , 19 june 2013 if you 've noticed an unusually high number of teenage girls sporting pink hair or dressed up to the nines in @entity8 , @entity10 's kitsch ' @entity2 ' trend could be to blame			0
translated as ' cuteness ' or ' adorable ' , the look involves emphasising child - like features such as big eyes and wearing doll - like dresses in sugary pinks , blues and yellows			0
so popular is @entity2 in @entity10 that even men are getting involved , attempting to adopt androgynous doll - like looks , and in the @entity22 , meanwhile , @entity2 is taking the teen world by storm			1
that 's because the show also hosts a @entity45 fashion show , this year dubbed the ' @entity46 ' , where models will take to the catwalk in sugary style			1
among those to take part in last year 's show is @entity53 , now a @entity55 model , and fan of the ' @entity33 ' style of @entity2 dressing , which includes piling on the lace , bows and frills in order to appear as sweet and girly as possible			1
' i really enjoyed it , ' she says of her appearance at the 2012 @entity2 show			2
' it was really nice to be able to smile in a catwalk and wear the clothes that i really felt comfortable in and enjoy wearing			0
' but she admits that the outlandish @entity45 look can sometimes lead to problems when she 's out and about in @entity39			2
' sometimes being a @entity45 girl can be hard as a lot of people do n't understand the fashion , and will shout at you in the street , ' she reveals			1
' but i do get a lot of people coming up to me and telling me how much they like my style too			0
i went from loving @entity2 things to being a bit of a kawaii - aholic ! ' getting it right : backstage at @entity55 's @entity29 , finishing touches are added looking good : kawaii girls show off their ultra-girly rainbow style ahead of this year 's @entity55 ' i 've always loved cute and frilly things so it was inevitable i would end up in love with @entity37 fashion , ' adds fellow @entity45 girl , @entity91			1
' where i live in @entity93 , there 's not much like it so i 'm always getting asked where i buy my clothes from and for what reason i 'm " dressed up "			0
' and @entity2 really is about dressing up			0
the commonest @entity45 style is called the ' classic @entity33 ' , which despite referencing the @entity99 novel in the name , has nothing to do with looking sexy and everything to do with achieving a look that is as cute , girlish and pretty as possible			1
based on frilled and furbelowed @entity106 styles combined with a hint of goth , girls hope to achieve a porcelain - doll look using lashings of lace , ribbons , bows , ruffles , bloomers , aprons , and ruffled petticoats			2
then there 's the ' @entity33 ' look loved by @entity53			2
featuring even more ribbons , bows , and lace , than the ' @entity33 ' , it leaves out the gothic elements in favour of pastels			1
@entity125 is also popular and involves giant bow headdresses or bonnets , teamed with lighter , less extreme make - up			0
' my initial inspiration was from @entity37 @entity33 brands and the more classic style of @entity33 , ' says long time @entity45 girl and @entity10 organiser , @entity134			1
glamorous : a pretty , wearable take on the @entity45 look created by make - up artist , @entity138 @entity139 hair : a kawaii girl shows off her striking two tone hairdo @entity143 : @entity37 singing sensation @entity144 shows off her @entity2 inspired look finishing touch : from bags to shoes and now nails , @entity8 is on just about everything in @entity10 ' i find it exciting and fun because being a @entity45 girl means you can express your personal style creatively and make it your own			1
' @entity157 has always been something i 'm passionate about and when you love what you do you tend to do want to do it well			0
it is also great to share to everyone what @entity2 style is all about			0
' for that , @entity134 has set up her own @entity167 group , @entity166 and @entity169 , to try and show a wider audience what @entity2 is all about			0
' it 's a great way to meet like minded people , ' she explains			0
' i founded @entity174 so that @entity37 street fashion enthusiasts from all walks of life in the @entity22 can meet and learn and share their love for fashion			1
' ' i love @entity45 fashion as it makes me so happy , ' adds @entity53			1
' i just wish more people were able to enjoy it in the @entity22			2
it gives me a chance to experiment and it makes getting dressed fun again			0
