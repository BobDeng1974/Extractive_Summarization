@entity0 and @entity1 will still try and lure @entity2 from @entity3 in january but both clubs face losing out to @entity5			1
@entity7 ’s medium - term injury means @entity2 may stay at @entity3 for the remainder of the season before leaving next summer when his contract expires			1
both the @entity12 and the @entity13 were willing to pay a fee of around £ 7million to lure the @entity16 international before he became a free agent when the mid-term window opens			2
if that happens then @entity1 will turned their attention to @entity32 ’s @entity20			1
but @entity33 is unlikely to endorse spending the recently quoted £ 30m price tag for the @entity36 midfielder			2
@entity37 could also challenge @entity1 for the services of goalkeeper @entity39			1
as revealed here weeks ago @entity39 wants to quit @entity0 now he is no longer first - choice keeper at the @entity12			1
it is understood @entity0 will sell @entity39 in january for a fee in the region of £ 7m			1
@entity39 ( left ) has been a virtual ever - present since moving to @entity0 from @entity44 in 2004 @entity1 centre half @entity45 is trying to help broker a deal to bring @entity16 international @entity48 , his former national team defensive partner , to the @entity50			1
but the bottom line is matching the fee that @entity53 want - which could be as much as £ 47m			2
@entity48 ( right ) is available for a vast £ 47m from @entity53 with @entity1 and @entity54 interested the @entity13 are unlikely to pay that - but @entity54 may well do - as soon as the january transfer window opens			1
it also seems that @entity54 will pip @entity1 to the signature of @entity59 midfielder @entity58 from @entity60			1
@entity37 will splash out to sign a new striker in the january transfer window			1
as revealed in this column three weeks ago their prime target is @entity66 striker @entity65			1
@entity65 is in sparkling form and is the latest striker touted to solve @entity37 's striker crisis the @entity66 have already rebuffed overtures from @entity71 with regard to a £ 15m offer for the @entity75 under 21 striker			1
but an offer approaching the £ 30m region will force @entity66 to sell			2
@entity78 may move for @entity80 midfielder @entity79 in january if they fail to secure @entity81 , who is on a season - long loan from @entity83 , on a long - term deal			0
the @entity78 are also trying to secure @entity85 on a new contract otherwise they face him leaving on a @entity87 at the end of the season			0
former @entity54 chief executive @entity90 is now working with @entity91 in a bid to help the club ’s ' commercial expansion '			2
the @entity96 hierarchy are working out the feasibility of signing @entity98 next summer			1
the £ 200m transfer fee to @entity83 and all inclusive personal terms approaching £ 500,000 - a - week for the @entity102 are not the main problem			1
@entity98 has been on @entity83 's books since the age of 11 when he moved to @entity106 from @entity102 i am told @entity96 ’s commercial operation think the player is worth the investment and the football advantages with regard to a proper tilt at the @entity115 next season are obvious			1
but fulfilling complex @entity117 rules are an issue			0
@entity119 , football director at @entity71 , faces being ' eased ' out of the club following the ' signing ' of @entity121 from @entity122 as head of recruitment			0
the announcement by @entity53 boss @entity126 that if he manages outside of @entity16 he wants it to be in @entity75 has been registered on the radar of the @entity37 and @entity1 boardrooms			1
@entity126 has spoken of his desire to manage outside @entity16 , with @entity1 and @entity37 interested @entity131 has been taking @entity25 lessons and may look to further his coaching career and horizons in @entity135			1
@entity136 has told pals that he is ready to stay with @entity96 until the end of the season before linking up with @entity140 mid-way through the @entity142 season which starts in march			1
@entity136 ( left ) is enjoying himself in @entity143 and would like to postpone his move to @entity140 @entity145 @entity146 , who has been ' resting ' since being sacked as @entity148 boss last year , will throw his hat into the ring if and when the @entity152 job becomes available @entity154 chairman @entity153 may have been foolish to appoint @entity155 as the club 's new manager given recent circumstances			2
the 77 - year - old may well also have made some ill - advised comments which have not sat well with the politically correct police or indeed indignant faux morality warriors			0
although his comments have in certain arenas been twisted to suit agendas			0
but to accuse @entity153 of being a ' racist ' is wrong			0
moreover such allegations cheapen the front line battle against racism			0
@entity153 claps during @entity155 's first game in charge of @entity154 , a 1 - 1 draw with @entity172 btw that @entity173 , the new isotonic drink which is supplying more and more football clubs and who bought the stadium naming rights at @entity179 , has pulled out of a deal with @entity154 in the wake the controversial fall out following the appointment of @entity155			2
sir @entity184 recently questioned whether captaincy is a good thing for @entity187			0
@entity184 reasoned that the burden of responsibility could weigh too heavily on @entity187 and undermine his performance			0
that could be true with @entity54 and may be something @entity193 will address			0
but with @entity75 it would seem @entity187 has defied those , hands up like myself , who were sceptical about giving @entity187 the armband not least on the basis given his poor displays at the @entity23 in the summer whether he was worthy of the automatic selection that usually comes with being appointed captain of your country			0
@entity187 has thrived since being named @entity75 captain and looks like a player reborn @entity37 return to the scene of the last season ’s crime where their title bid finally hit the buffers when they allowed @entity212 to hold them to a draw having eased into a three - nil lead in the penultimate game of the season			1
@entity219 offer odds of 90 - 1 on another 3 - 3			0
@entity212 to win 1 - 0 is 12 - 1			0
a 3 - 1 @entity37 win is 16 - 1			2
for those @entity212 fans who fondly remember their 4 - 3 @entity224 semi final win over the @entity225 at @entity226 in 1990 @entity227 offer 249 - 1 for a repeat of that			0
earlier that season @entity37 beat @entity212 9 - 0 in the league at @entity231			2
@entity232 offer 500 - 1 for a repeat of that			0
as it ’s turned out , thus far at least , @entity187 seems to have been inspired and matured in an @entity75 shirt since wearing the armband			0
it ’s not just the six goals in six games this season which have moved him to within three of @entity244 ’s 49 goal record for @entity75 that prove the point			0
it ’s been the manner in which he has performed and led what has become a young squad			0
@entity187 was a proper leader in @entity75 ’s impressive 3 - 1 win over @entity252			0
what caught the eye was n’t so much the two goals he struck , but the way all the team , especially @entity259 , seem to want to bust a gut around their new skipper , who , in turn is now performing like a talisman rather than a prima donna .			2

@entity2 could be available for £ 7m but @entity5 look ready to *swoop*
if so , @entity1 and @entity0 will look to @entity32 's @entity20
@entity37 eye @entity39 and @entity65 as they overhaul their spine
per @entity45 wants @entity48 to join him at @entity1
and @entity96 are weighing up an *astonishing* £ 200m bid for @entity98
