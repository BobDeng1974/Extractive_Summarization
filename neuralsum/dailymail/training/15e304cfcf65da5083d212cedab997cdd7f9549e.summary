by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 22 july 2013 congressman @entity1 hit out at the media today for trying to make what he calls a ' personal tragedy ' with the model he once thought was his daughter into an ' @entity8 thing '			1
the 63 - year - old also revealed this morning that even though @entity10 , 25 , is not his biological daughter , he still loves her and they still plan on having a relationship			1
' i loved her and i love her now , everybody parses my words , " i loved her but now she 's gone " but that 's not true , ' he said in an interview with @entity20			2
' we had a bond and these people making these salacious accusations ... it 's different for her and me , it 's plain wrong and i need to go back to doing important work			0
' @entity8 was forced to resign from @entity29 in 2011 after he tweeted sexually suggestive pictures to a number of young , pretty women			2
' with tears in his eyes he added : ' i had visions of her being my heir and going to her wedding and having grandchildren			0
it 's been heartbreaking and devastating , and i 've just been crushed			0
last week , @entity10 gave an interview about the events surrounding the identity of her real father , which @entity1 explained this morning : ' on tv she was saying , " @entity1 is not my father , not my biological father " , and the second part was edited out by @entity50			1
' she was saying we still have a relationship and she sent me a beautiful @entity74 card and it said : ' you will always be my father in many ways			1
' ' the press has made this into a story			0
this is a personal tragedy that should be allowed for me and @entity83 to deal with independently			0
she 's hiding out in @entity85 and she hates it , so does her mother			0
' i 'm in the public eye , i 'm tired of it , i want to get back to legislating			0
this stuff should be left private and if it 's not private it ought to be dealt with honestly			0
' explaining the february tweet that exposed his relationship with @entity10 , he said : ' i was thrilled she was watching the @entity94			1
she was raised in @entity95 and her main issues are @entity97 , expensive , stylish clothes and fun			2
oh and watching her boyfriend play softball			0
texting ? congressman @entity1 was seen sending a @entity102 during the @entity94 in february ( left ) and the recipient was @entity104 ( right ) who he later revealed was his daughter - or so he thought unintended audience : though he meant to send it as a direct message , he sent it to his 6,000 followers and deleted it shortly after @entity10 ( left ) stands with her real father , @entity85 oil businessman @entity112 ' i was happy she watched because i 've been trying to teach her about government			1
i thought , " my daughter needs to know about politics and government " , so i just wrote back " thanks for watching "			2
' the tweet said : ' @entity121 's beautiful girl			1
' he ended the message by writing ' ilu , ' which is short for ' i love you '			2
back in february , @entity1 had initially claimed that the model that he was tweeting during the televised speech was a family friend			1
but that did n't silence critics who thought it odd that the ended the message by writing ' ilu			0
' the congressman later admitted @entity10 was his daughter from a previous relationship			1
@entity1 said last week he was ' stunned and dismayed ' after @entity50 had a paternity test done on the 25 - year - old model with @entity1 ’s participation			1
it revealed that @entity112 - the man who raised her and the ex-husband to her mother - is in fact her father			1
@entity10 , the president of @entity85 - based @entity143 , told @entity144 that @entity1 's claims of paternity ' rocked ' his world			1
@entity148 , the mother of @entity10 , is pictured			2
she had a relationship with @entity1 around the time of @entity83 's birth the 63 - year - old , three - term congressman said that he only discovered he had fathered the young woman when he did a @entity156 search of her mother @entity148 and found out she had a daughter			1
he contacted her after realizing that the ' math looked pretty accurate '			0
' the mom told me we had a lot of catching up to do , ' he told @entity164			0
@entity1 said that the mother confirmed that he was the father , saying that she sees physical similarities between the two			1
the mother said : ' every time i look at her i see the @entity169 in her face			0
' daughter : @entity172 is known about @entity10 except that she is a 24 - year - old model @entity1 told @entity164 : ' i ’m @entity174 - close enough			1
' @entity1 's heritage is a proud point for the politician , as he is the first @entity179 congressman from @entity180			1
from there , he began to build a relationship with ms @entity10 , taking her on a tour of the @entity45 and @entity46			2
he went on to share a picture from the @entity46 with @entity164 reporter @entity185 , who said via @entity102 that during their interview ' @entity1 was emotional while telling the story about his daughter , fought back tears , could feel genuine fatherly emotion			2
' while the emotional reunion likely silences political watchers , it does n't necessarily quiet his constituents who take issue with the fact he was tweeting at all			0
' that goes to show you he had his mind on other things except the @entity94 , ' @entity198 from @entity199 told local news station @entity204			0
' everybody carries a phone but it should have been off for something that important			0
