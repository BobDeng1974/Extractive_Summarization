by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 07:42 est , 13 september 2013 just over a year ago , @entity2 , 46 , was so overweight at 27st , she could n't walk without the aid of a stick			1
today , she 's @entity5 's unlikeliest personal trainer			1
although she 's still a size 24 - 26 , she 's on a mission to get the fuller figured out of their armchairs and into the gym			1
her fledgling business , @entity12 , is aimed at larger ladies and although she says anyone of any size is welcome , the exercises are tailored to the overweight			1
good example : @entity2 ( right ) shows off her moves in front of a class of eager students improvement : @entity2 's classes are tailored to fuller - figured gym goers and have proved hugely popular she said there was a gap in the fitness market for the @entity29 method because there are currently no other classes ' designed for fat people '			1
she said overweight people may struggle to do some of the moves in a traditional workout because of their body shape and mobility			1
she explains : ' if you do something like a grapevine , some of the movements are really difficult because they have fat between their legs and they just ca n't keep up			0
' when they first come in , i can see them walking how i used to walk and they lack a full range of movement			1
' @entity49 's own route to fitness started more than a decade ago when she qualified as a fitness instructor			2
but an unhealthy diet led to her piling on the pounds and eventually , she was so overweight she was told that she would need a gastric band			2
even after the band had been fitted , her weight continued to yo - yo because , as she puts it , ' you can eat anything , really			2
even unhealthy stuff like chocolate			0
' @entity2 said people are sometimes surprised to see someone of her size leading a class but she points out that you do n't always have to be slim to be fit ' my weight went up and down , ' she explains			1
' i needed to do more than diet			0
something just had to change			0
i needed to get off my butt really			0
' her eureka moment came when she decided to give up her role as a community development officer and pursue a business idea that had first struck her a decade before - fitness for the fuller figured			1
a chance conversation at the local job centre led to a small amount of funding being made available and she launched her first fitness class at the @entity84 in @entity85 in november last year			1
' i get all sizes coming to my class because not everybody wants to be slim , some people want to be fit and they are n't always associated ' the first class attracted 27 people and triggered a flood of positive feedback			1
as her reputation grew , @entity2 was asked to run more classes and will soon launch a regular class at @entity97 in central @entity98			1
much to her surprise , not all of the interest has been from larger ladies , although as she explains , some people just want to be fit , not thin			2
' i get all sizes coming to my class because not everybody wants to be slim , some people want to be fit and they are n't always associated , ' she explains			1
all welcome : the class is open to all shapes and sizes ' people who come range from " i need a chair to exercise " to others who are probably fitter than me ! i 've had people who are size 30 and 32 but i 've have people who are a size 8 too			1
' the classes are a good step up into exercise and good way of warming up major muscle groups , building up your core but also a great way to feel more positive [ about yourself ]			2
' exercise is integral for tackling obesity			0
it burns calories , gives you endorphins and it acts like a platform that improvements for people 's lives spirals from			2
' it changes people 's lives and it 's doable			2
we do n't do star jumps and we warm them up and cool them down properly so they come back saying they feel better			0
' it has n't been entirely plain sailing though , as @entity49 explains : ' some people are shocked and you can see them thinking " are you an instructor ? " and looking me up and down			2
but most really enjoy it			0
' obesity is fast becoming one of the biggest challenges facing the @entity152 , with a staggering 62 per cent of @entity5 people now overweight or obese according to figures released by the @entity155			1
worse still , the department has forecast that the cost of treating obesity will rise to a staggering Â£ 6.2bn a year by 2015			0
not right : according to @entity2 , traditional fitness classes are n't always suitable for bigger women but despite the overwhelming scale of the problem , treating the condition still focuses on diet and bariatric surgery such as gastric bands			1
so why not exercise ? ' it 's very important to put together good healthy eating and making positive exercise choices , ' says @entity49 when asked whether the @entity152 needs to do more to get fuller figured patients moving			2
' i think a lot of big people think " oh i do n't like going to the gym " but they just have n't tried it			0
i get loads of inquiries and then people do n't come			0
i think they sit on it and ponder for a while			0
' i do get people who come and find the class just is n't for them but some who do drop out have other issues			1
' i think a lot of big people think " oh i do n't like going to the gym " but they just have n't tried it ' ' some people who are big are going through drama or depressed and do n't come back because of that , ' she continues			0
' it 's about encouraging them to make a positive choice			0
' at the moment , @entity49 is focused on making sure that her @entity97 class is a success but she 's got big plans for the future and thinks gyms and other fitness businesses need to to more to become more fuller - figure friendly			1
' we need institutional and personal change so classes like @entity12 can filter onto the high street , ' she explains			0
' i know this might take a while but in the meantime , i want to try and change as many lives as possible			0
' thousands have been spent on these [ health ] conferences and its not about everyone philosophising			0
let 's just do something and get people dancing and feeling better ! ' and of course , she 's looking forward to living life to the full now she 's no longer hampered by being overweight			1
' i used to get tired walking down the road , ' she adds			0
' now i can run for the bus without being out of breath			0
