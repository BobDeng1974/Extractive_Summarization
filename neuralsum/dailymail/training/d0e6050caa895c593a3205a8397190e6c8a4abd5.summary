whether it 's leaving their phone on the car roof before driving off or sending a message with an autocorrect mistake , most of us have been left red - faced thanks to our phones			2
a third ( 33 per cent ) of blushing @entity27 have mistakenly called or texted the wrong person the most common ' phone pas ' is found to be finger fumbling with two fifths of @entity27 ( 41 per cent ) admitting to red faces after accidentally pressing the wrong button on their phone			1
a third ( 33 per cent ) of blushing @entity27 have mistakenly called or texted the wrong person whilst 19 per cent admit to misplacing their phone in their own home - losing it down the sofa or even somehow putting it in the washing machine			1
with growing dependence on mobile phones , it 's not surprising that the ' phone pas ' is on the rise			1
receiving a text that does n't make sense annoys a third ( 30 per cent ) of @entity27 being rushed or in a hurry is the top reason for the @entity27 's phone pas with a third ( 31 per cent ) citing this as the most common reason , with women ( 35 per cent ) more susceptible than men ( 28 per cent )			1
