' i was talking about my loved ones and my dog			2
anything to keep me from staring at my ankle			2

‘ i ’m not going to tell you how scared i am of bears right now , ’ she continues , flashing her pearly whites with a laugh			0
referencing her agony only a few times , @entity6 desperately focuses on other things , giving shout outs to her friends and family , as well as describing her surroundings			1
