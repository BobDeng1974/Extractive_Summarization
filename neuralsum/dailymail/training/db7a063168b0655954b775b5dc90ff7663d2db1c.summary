@entity0 , described as a ' natural genius ' , has finally had the mathematical functions he came up with on his deathbed proved correct researchers have finally solved the cryptic deathbed puzzle renowned @entity7 mathematician @entity0 claimed came to him in dreams			1
while on his death - bed in 1920 , @entity0 wrote a letter to his mentor , @entity12 mathematician @entity11 , outlining several new mathematical functions never before heard of , along with a hunch about how they worked , decades years later , researchers say they 've proved he was right - and that the formula could explain the behaviour of black holes			1
' we 've solved the problems from his last mysterious letters , ' @entity21 mathematician @entity20 said			0
' for people who work in this area of math , the problem has been open for 90 years , ' @entity0 , a self - taught mathematician born in a rural village in @entity30 , spent so much time thinking about math that he flunked out of college in @entity30 twice , @entity20 said			1
@entity0 's letter described several new functions that behaved differently from known theta functions , or modular forms , and yet closely mimicked them			2
functions are equations that can be drawn as graphs on an axis , like a sine wave , and produce an output when computed for any chosen input or value			0
@entity0 conjectured that his mock modular forms corresponded to the ordinary modular forms earlier identified by @entity49 , and that both would wind up with similar outputs for roots of 1			2
@entity0 , a devout @entity53 , thought these patterns were revealed to him by the goddess @entity55			2
' it was n’t until 2002 , through the work of @entity65 , that we had a description of the functions that @entity0 was writing about in 1920 , ' @entity20 said			1
@entity20 and his colleagues drew on modern mathematical tools that had not been developed before @entity0 ’s death to prove this theory was correct			1
' we proved that @entity0 was right , ' @entity20 says			1
' we found the formula explaining one of the visions that he believed came from his goddess			0
' the team were also stunned to find the function could be used today			0
' no one was talking about black holes back in the 1920s when @entity0 first came up with mock modular forms , and yet , his work may unlock secrets about them , ' @entity20 says			1
a highlight of working on a film about @entity0 's life was getting to browse through some of the @entity7 master 's original notebooks , said @entity20 , right ' @entity0 's legacy , it turns out , is much more important than anything anyone would have guessed when @entity0 died , ' @entity20 said			2
the findings were presented last month at the @entity0 125 conference at the @entity99 , ahead of the 125th anniversary of the mathematician 's birth on dec. 22nd			2
' @entity103 at @entity104 ( centre ) december 22 , 2012 marks the 125th birth anniversary of @entity0 , the self taught mathematician born into a modest and conservative family in @entity110 , a relatively small town in @entity111			0
@entity0 was self - taught and worked in almost complete isolation from the mathematical community of his time			1
described as a raw genius , he independently rediscovered many existing results , as well as making his own unique contributions , believing his inspiration came from the @entity53 goddess @entity55			0
he spent so much time thinking about math that he flunked out of college in @entity30 twice			0
he overcame several hurdles to find a place among the celebrated intellectuals of @entity104			0
@entity0 passed away at the young age of 32 of tuberculosis , but he left behind formulations in mathematics that have paved the path for many scholars who came after him .			0

theory came to @entity0 in a dream on his deathbed in 1920 - but has never been proved
@entity136 could now be used to explain the behaviour of parts of a black hole
