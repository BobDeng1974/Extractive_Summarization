during a segment about maj. @entity8 , a female pilot from the @entity9 who led a mission this week against @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity6 referred to her mission as ' boobs on the ground			1
' now , after outrage from viewers , and even his own wife , following these insensitive remarks , he has apologized			1
' i said sorry to my wife and i apologize to all of you as well and want to make that very clear			2
' this all began when @entity6 's cohost , @entity24 , praised maj. @entity8 on the program wednesday afternoon			1
' @entity45 , you were bombed by a woman , ' @entity24 said			0
' oh yeah , hell came down on @entity11 in @entity12 , because guess what : the first female pilot piloting for the [ @entity9 ] , there she was , leading the strikes			1
dropped the bombs on @entity11 monday night			2
' maj. @entity8 , 35 , was the first woman to join the @entity54			1
' this is really incredible , ' @entity24 continued			0
' @entity56 is who did this			0
i wish it was an @entity61 pilot			0
i 'll take a woman doing this any day to them			0
right after she said this , the men on the panel began making sexist jokes			2
outraged : @entity24 asked the men why they were ' ruining her thing ' as she tried to celebrate the fighter pilot and her accomplishments big deal : maj. @entity8 ( above ) , 35 , was the first woman to join the @entity54 embarrassing : @entity1 anchor @entity74 took the men ( seen above with their fellow panelists on the five ) to task over their comments on her eponymous show later that day ' problem is , after she bombed it she could n't park it , ' said @entity26			1
that 's when @entity6 added , ' would that be considered boobs on the ground , or no ? ' at this point @entity24 became visibly upset with the men , and asked them why they were ' ruining her thing			2
' later that day , @entity1 anchor @entity74 took the boys to task on her eponymous show			0
