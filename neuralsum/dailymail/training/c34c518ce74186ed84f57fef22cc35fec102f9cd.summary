by @entity0 last updated at 9:57 am on 31st january 2012 @entity2 workers yesterday rejected a £ 500 bonus to simply do their jobs during the @entity5			1
@entity7 bosses insisted it was not an ‘ adequate reward ’ for 14,000 staff including drivers , station and ticket staff , signallers and engineers			1
the @entity16 , led by @entity17 , was accused of holding @entity18 and @entity5 chiefs to ransom after talks on the payment ended in disagreement			1
tube workers have rejected the latest offer of pay for not going on strike during the @entity5 the breakdown sabotaged the vip launch of a campaign to persuade spectators and commuters that the capital ’s transport system can cope with the huge demands of the @entity36			2
the bonus would come on top of £ 1,200 extra already earmarked for 3,500 tube drivers for working different and longer shifts during the @entity5			1
and all @entity18 workers are getting a generous four - year general pay deal			1
this will leave the average driver ’s annual salary at more than £ 50,000 for a 35 - hour week with more than eight weeks of holiday			1
general secretary of the @entity16 @entity17 says his union just wants ' a fair deal ' former transport minister @entity50 mp said : ‘ the unions should not hold @entity18 to ransom during the @entity5 as millions of people struggle during these difficult economic times			1
’ @entity56 , of the @entity57 ’ @entity55 , added : ‘ the @entity5 has cost enough without the threat of @entity2 drivers holding the capital and the @entity36 to ransom			2
’ the controversial bonus is an annual payment based on customer surveys			2
both the @entity16 and bosses agree it should be higher this year to reward the ‘ additional effort ’ of staff , but can not agree by how much			1
the rejected amount , claims the union , is made up of £ 100 for meeting ‘ unspecified and arbitrary ’ targets			1
the remaining £ 400 is based on £ 20 per shift over the month - long event , when millions of extra people will use the transport system			1
but the hard - line union objects as those on leave or off sick would receive ‘ less or nothing ’			2
it also claimed : ‘ there is no reward for the increased workload taken on by staff			1
’ @entity16 chiefs are also angry that : ‘ this offer does not reward staff for the work during the run - up to the @entity36			1
’ general secretary mr @entity17 said the union would continue to press for an across - the - board payment to all staff			2
‘ all we are calling for is a fair deal for all the staff involved in delivering the colossal transport challenge that we will be facing this summer , ’ he insisted			1
@entity99 boss @entity98 said the breakdown in talks was ‘ a tactic ’			2
he added : ‘ we will get a deal with the @entity16			1
our staff are going to be very proud to do this			2
’ let the @entity36 commence : the deal would cover a period of almost nine weeks during the @entity5 and @entity108 other transport workers are also cashing in on the games			2
just days ago , workers on the @entity112 were given a deal worth up to £ 2,500 to work up to five hours of guaranteed overtime per week during the event			1
more than 500 staff on the @entity117 are also getting a bonus of at least £ 600			1
the latest dispute threatened to overshadow the high - profile drive to boost public confidence that @entity18 ’s transport network will cope with the huge demands of the @entity5			2
@entity18 's transport commissioner @entity98 has suggested people should ‘ go for a beer ’ to help space out their journeys at peak times during the @entity5			0
he was speaking as a publicity campaign was launched today to try to help people navigate @entity18 ’s public transport system during the @entity36			0
there is information available online of the 30 busiest stations and where ‘ in theory ’ people could be waiting for half an hour , he pointed out			0
mr @entity98 said : ‘ with a bit of forethought and care about when you use the transport system at a very busy time it will all work out alright			0
‘ i have never seen anyone in a tube station for half an hour - go for a beer			0
' we are on track but still have an awful lot to do			0
we have got to get the athletes to the @entity36 but we also have to keep the city moving			0
’ the campaign also suggests other options for people , such as working at different times or locations , teleconferencing rather than travelling to meetings , or alternative modes of transport including walking and cycling where practical			0
those involved included transport secretary @entity160 , @entity18 mayor @entity161 and @entity162 , head of @entity5 organisers @entity163			0
mr @entity98 said : ‘ we ’re not saying it will all run perfectly			0
we ’re trying to make it run as well as we can			0
it ’ll be all right			0
