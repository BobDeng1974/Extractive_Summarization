robbed : police investigating the theft of 12 prize - winning guinea pigs from top breeder @entity5 ( pictured ) have not ruled out - a rival competitor sabotage : heartbroken owner @entity5 ( pictured ) believes only an expert could have targetted the dozen show - quality guinea pigs he said : ' they knew exactly what they were looking for			1
they took two tortoiseshells , two black and two brown , all short - haired guinea pigs that besides being show - quality , were also beloved family pets			1
' they left six which were not show quality , plus two other show ones			2
' @entity5 yesterday issued a desperate plea to the thief to return the treasured pets to him			1
