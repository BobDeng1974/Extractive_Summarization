by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:53 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 09:50 est , 15 july 2013 controversial : the @entity2 of @entity3 argue that a misunderstanding about the benefits system is encouraging some teenagers to have children teenage mothers should lose their benefits if they refuse to live at home with their parents , a group of @entity11 mps warned today			1
@entity16 is urged to introduce tough sanctions on young women to stop the welfare system ‘ encouraging them to have a child ’			1
the @entity2 of @entity3 most at risk of losing their seats at the next election said benefits for teenage mothers should only be paid if they live at home or in special hostels			2
in a new book the @entity3 set out a raft of ideas for future @entity11 policy , including cutting child benefit for parents whose children repeatedly play truant , curbing wind farms and capping the number of @entity38 foreign students entering the @entity39			1
the group hopes to broaden the appeal of the party , particularly in the north of @entity44			0
in a foreward to the book , mr @entity16 says the ideas are ' interesting ' and ' valuable '			0
but the prime minister added that party members would have ' inevitably different views ' about them			0
the most controversial idea is the proposal to force teenagers with babies to live with their parents			1
the mps claim that perceptions of the welfare state mean some young people to think wrongly think that if they get pregnant they will be entitled to free housing			1
this is ‘ encouraging them to have a child ’ , the @entity3 argue			1
according to the @entity63 , the @entity3 suggest ‘ all benefits to teenage mothers should be made on the condition of them living with their parents or in supervised hostel accommodation ’			1
interesting : the ideas have been sent to @entity16 , who today met the president of burma @entity70 , in @entity72 @entity11 mp @entity73 , a member of the @entity2 , admitted the idea was ‘ controversial but insisted tougher action was needed to tackle the welfare state			2
he told the @entity63 : ‘ i know this is a controversial idea , but it ’s one of the ideas that is floated in the book			0
‘ there has been a lot of progress made on teenage pregnancy over the last few years ; we still have high rates in comparison with our @entity89 partners , so i think it ’s one thing that the government should be looking at and the conservative party should be looking at as we look forward to further welfare reform			0
’ controversial : @entity11 mp @entity73 said tackling welfare had to be a priority for the future the @entity2 has been formed of the 40 mps with the slimmest majorities , who could be most vulnerable at the next election			1
mr @entity73 said in these crucial swing seats welfare reform is one of the top priorities			0
‘ it ’s way up there as a priority and people are very concerned about benefits and the welfare system			2
‘ and the book we ’ve published today is a book which is 40 ideas across the 40 most marginal seats across the country			2
‘ welfare reform does form part of it and i think we can be pushing harder on looking at issues around teenage pregnancy , but the book is actually much broader than that			0
it has ideas around how to improve the health service and tackling the growing problems of mental health and mental illness			0
so it ’s a pretty mainstream book in terms of its ideas			0

new 40 group of @entity11 mps *launch* book of policies to win support in 2015
they claim benefits system is ' encouraging ' teenagers to have babies
also want to cut child benefit for parents of *persistent* truants
