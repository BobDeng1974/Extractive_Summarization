@entity1 ’s @entity0 was silently removed from the tech firm 's online store in september due to a lack of parts , said boss @entity6 amidst the furore of the @entity9 launch in september , @entity1 silently killed off its @entity0			1
but it was n't a drop in sales that brought about its demise , according to boss @entity6 , instead it was blamed on a lack of mechanical parts			1
speaking at the @entity18 conference , mr @entity6 said the tech giant no longer had access to the components needs to make the once iconic music player			1
and although sales for the product had fallen significantly in recent years , sourcing parts was the final nail in the coffin			0
mr @entity6 added the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts , but it would n't have been cost - effective and would have involved a ' massive ' task			1
' we could n't get the parts anymore , not anywhere on @entity34 , ' explained mr @entity6			1
' it was n't a matter of me swinging the axe , saying " what can i kill today ? " the @entity40 was the @entity1 ’s first digital music player , and although the original debuted in 2001 , there were six generations released up until 2007			1
when @entity1 ’s online store came back online following its @entity9 event in september , this later model was missing from the @entity0 lineup			1
@entity1 did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line at the time			2
according to an earnings report earlier this year , @entity1 's @entity0 sales in the final quarter of 2013 dropped 52 per cent year - on - year			2
@entity1 also lost 55 per cent in revenue on all models of the music player , compared to the previous year , and the @entity0 makes up less than 2 per cent of the company 's overall income			1
the drop in sales is attributed to the increase in music apps , cloud storage and streaming services including @entity66			0
@entity1 did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line according to an earnings report earlier this year , @entity1 sold 6 million ipods in the final quarter of 2013			2
although that was almost double the sales of the previous three months , it equated to a 52 % drop in sales year - on - year			0
the drop is being attributed to the increase in music apps , cloud storage and streaming services additionally , @entity82 come with @entity83 built - in , making the @entity0 redundant for most @entity9 owners			2
the trend was n't helped by the fact @entity1 had n't released a new version of the music player since the fifth - generation @entity89 , and seventh - generation @entity90 launched in 2012			1
sales of @entity73 were at their highest during 2008 following the launch of the first @entity89 at the end of 2007			0
the @entity89 was designed to look like an @entity9 , played music and ran apps , but could not make calls			0
the peak in sales in 2008 was attributed to the launch of the first @entity89 ( left ) at the end of 2007			0
the ipod touch was designed to look like an @entity9 , played music and ran apps , but could not make calls			0
this was followed by the popular , colourful fourth - generation @entity90 ( right ) similar sales were seen across 2009 thanks to the launch of the third - generation shuffle , fourth - generation nano and second - generation touch			0
since january this year , reports claim @entity1 has sold around 12 million units , which is less than half of 2013 sales figures			2
the highest capacity @entity0 now available is the @entity115 version of the @entity89 , which costs £ 249 in the @entity116 and $ 299 in the @entity117			0
customers may still be able to get their hands on an @entity0 through third - party retailers , until stock runs out .			0
