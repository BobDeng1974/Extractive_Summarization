a 53 - year - old paedophile opened a milk bar near a high school before he assaulted another victim , despite having previously been jailed for two years for sexual offences against a teenage boy			1
@entity6 , who was locked up in a @entity8 jail in the late 1990s , started a new life in @entity10 where he took over the store in @entity13 ’s south east that advertised ' after - school specials ' in late @entity15 revealed			1
the convicted child sex offender was sentenced to seven months jail on thursday after he groped a boy , showed him pornography , and sent him a picture of his genitals			2
convicted child sex offender @entity6 ran a milk bar in @entity13 ’s south east near a high school @entity6 's lawyer said he would appeal the sentence handed down for three counts of committing an indecent act against a teenager			1
the age reports that detectives investigating @entity6 ’s latest sex crime did not know he was running a milk bar			1
this is thought to be because his last conviction was before the @entity36 was introduced to @entity10 in 2004 , meaning @entity6 did not receive police monitoring while living in the state			1
the @entity36 tracks those convicted of sex offences against children after 2003			2
an individual can be placed on the register for a period of eight or fifteen years , or for life , depending on the type and severity of the offences			2
all states now use a website that monitors and shares mandatory information about convicted paedophiles with police across states and enables alerts to be generated when registered persons say that they are planning to travel interstate or overseas			0
however , there have been calls for a public national sex offender register , a proposal recently rejected by all states and territories apart from the @entity64 at a @entity65			0
the @entity64 became the first jurisdiction in @entity67 to introduce a website where the public can look up what convicted sex offenders are in their area , including an image and physical description			0
the @entity64 ’s register will be named after murdered @entity8 teenager @entity76 , whose parents @entity78 and @entity80 have campaigned for over a decade for a public register			2
' every parent has the right to know if there is a dangerous sex offender living in their neighbourhood , ' they said in a statement			0
tireless ‘ name and shame ’ campaigner @entity90 has also fought to have a national public register introduced and told @entity92 that this milk bar story is not an example of someone slipping through the system because a ‘ system does n’t exist ’			1
if there was a national public register the public could have seen this sleazy guy running “ after - school specials ” for kids and they could have checked the register and looked him up , ’ mr @entity90 said			1
mr @entity90 , who has served time in jail and five weeks under house arrest as a consequence of his belief that the public have ‘ a right to know ’ who sex offenders are , also slammed the sentence handed down to @entity6			1
‘ what also angers me is he ’s got a seven month jail sentence despite previous convictions and the lawyer says he ’s going to appeal			0
i hope he does appeal and it gets changed to seven years			0
’ the veteran journalist said @entity67 is home to over 100,000 predators and if it ’s just the @entity64 that uses a public register they will cross state borders to avoid detection			0
‘ the @entity64 is going to bring this in and this story is a prime example of the reason we need it to be national because it ’s a domino effect and people crossing state borders … this gives me even more belief that in three years we will have a national register , ’ he explained			0
