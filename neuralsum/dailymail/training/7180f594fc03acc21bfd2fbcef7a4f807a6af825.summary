by @entity0 @entity2 mp @entity1 has warned the @entity3 is ' not fit for purpose ' and ' risks undermining public trust ' in charities money given to charity could be diverted to terrorists because a watchdog is not investigating abuses properly , a damning report has warned			1
the @entity3 monitors voluntary organisations over three areas of high risk : fraud , whether they safeguard beneficiaries , and counter-terrorism			1
but it now has only two members of staff doing this work and just 42 probes were started last year , compared to 306 a year before the last election , increasing a ‘ risk that serious concerns will go undetected ’			1
in a critical report , the @entity29 spending watchdog said failings could damage public faith in good causes			1
the commission needs a ‘ radical change of pace and rigour ’ , it said			0
bosses were warned to expect ‘ tough questions ’ when they appear before the commons public accounts committee this month			0
its chairman , @entity2 mp @entity1 , said the report suggested the body was not ‘ fit for purpose ’ and ‘ risks undermining public trust ’ in charities			1
it is an indictment of the chairmanship of so - called ‘ quango queen ’ @entity52 , who left in july last year			0
over her six - year reign dame @entity54 , who held a number of other public posts at the same time , attracted controversy for her criticism of independent schools			2
she was paid £ 80,000 for a three - day week			0
the @entity29 report was prompted by @entity62 ’ concerns at a complex tax avoidance scheme engaged in by charity @entity65			1
it gave just £ 152,292 to good causes despite trying to claim back a stunning £ 46million in gift aid from tax authorities on its £ 177million income			0
the commission launched a full investigation in april , admitting the case was ‘ a disaster for the charity sector ’			2
it insists its records suggest the case was unique – but it did identify 13 other charities which required investigation			0
but the @entity29 said the body should have acted far sooner			2
its report found the commission was ‘ not regulating charities effectively ’ and was failing to provide value for money to the taxpayer for its £ 22.7million - a - year budget			1
it said : ‘ it does important and necessary work and its independent status is highly valued , but it does not do enough to identify and tackle abuse of charitable status			0
’ it noted that the @entity29 had ‘ repeatedly identified concerns ’ in reports stretching back more than 25 years , and said that the commission was slow to act			1
‘ it uses its information poorly to assess risk and often relies solely on trustees ’ assurances			0
‘ where it does identify concerns in charities , it makes little use of its powers and fails to take tough action in some of the most serious cases			0
‘ the commission is too passive in pursuing its objectives , letting practical and legal barriers prevent action , rather than considering alternative ways to prevent abuse of charitable status			0
’ the @entity29 criticised the @entity3 for reducing staff monitoring things like counter-terrorism from around eight full - time equivalents to two			1
the report comes as an indictment of the chairmanship of so - called ' quango queen ' @entity52 , pictured , who left in july last year the report said : ‘ it opened 42 monitoring cases in 2012/13 and 72 in 2011/12 , 276 in 2010/11 and 306 in 2009/10			1
this reduction in monitoring cases increases the risk that serious concerns will go undetected			0
’ in the three years to march , not one charity trustee was removed by the commission , only two were suspended and there were only 17 instances where it intervened to prevent charities entering transactions			2
one pound in every ten of its budget was spent on accommodation and staff complaints about an unreliable it system			0
efforts to cope with a recent 40 per cent budget cut failed to ‘ put sufficient emphasis on the rigour of its registration process and its investigation of wrongdoing ’ , the @entity29 said			2
the report concluded : ‘ we welcome the commission ’s intention to change its strategy , and encourage the new board to bring about the radical change of pace and rigour which is so evidently needed			2
’ @entity157 , the commission ’s chief executive , will appear before the public accounts committee on december 16 , nine months after he was grilled on the @entity65 case			2
mrs @entity1 suggested then that there could be as many as 50 other tax avoidance cases – but the @entity29 report said the commission ’s internal investigations had discounted that claim			1
sir @entity167 , of the @entity168 , said : ‘ this report reflects what we have said for years			0
in order to maintain public trust , charities want a vigilant and effective regulator which takes prompt action in the rare instances of abuse			1
