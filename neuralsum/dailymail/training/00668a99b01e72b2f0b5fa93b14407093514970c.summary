@entity16 leader @entity15 became embroiled in the row suggesting mothers could ' sit in the corner ' in restaurants to avoid offending people - and he insisted it was ' not too difficult ' to feed a child in a way that was ' not openly ostentatious '			1

@entity45 's has said it ' embraces ' breastfeeding , but requests that women are ' discreet towards other guests '			1
but mother - of - three mrs @entity10 , 35 , said she was ' shocked and appalled ' when she was told to cover up			1

she travelled from @entity56 with her 18 - month - old daughter @entity57 to be at the protest			0
reaction : the demonstration took place days after @entity10 complained that she was asked to place a large napkin over her baby 's head in the restaurant as she breastfed @entity45 's has said it ' embraces ' breastfeeding , but requests that women are ' discreet towards other guests ' the 2010 @entity71 makes it unlawful for a business to discriminate against a breastfeeding woman she said : ' i am here because someone broke the law by telling a woman to be unnecessarily discreet when she was breastfeeding in public			1
' @entity82 was being discreet when she was feeding her baby			0
we are here to show @entity45 's they are not above the law			0
but they have said nothing to us , they are pretending we 're not here			0
' every time something like this happens , many women are put off for life from breastfeeding			2
' we 're here to challenge that stigma and show women it 's normal and natural			0
' at 2pm today , about 40 mothers sat outside the entrance to the hotel to feed their babies in a protest organised by @entity42 to feed , which campaigns for the ' normalising ' of public breastfeeding breastfeeding mothers and supporters of @entity105 staged a peaceful protest outside @entity3 's in reference to mr @entity15 's comments , she said : ' not everyone agrees			1
i 'm not bothered what people think			0
we 're here to encourage women to breastfeed , regardless			2
' protest : @entity33 feeds seven - month - old daughter @entity34 outside @entity3 's the 2010 @entity71 makes it unlawful for a business to discriminate against a breastfeeding woman			1
setting out his views on the subject on his regular @entity122 phone - in , mr @entity15 said : ' i am not particularly bothered about it , but i know a lot of people do feel very uncomfortable			1
' this is just a matter of common sense , is n't it ? given that some people feel very embarrassed by it , it is n't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that is not openly ostentatious			2
' he argued it was ' up to @entity3 's ' what rules it wanted to operate			0
pressed on whether it would be right for a hotel to ask mothers to use the ' ladies ' room ' to feed , the @entity139 replied : ' or perhaps sit in the corner , or whatever it might be			1
that is up to @entity3 's			0
' it 's not an issue i get terribly hung up about but i know particularly people of the older generation feel awkward and embarrassed by it			0
' @entity155 chief executive @entity154 said : ' it 's bemusing that some people have a problem seeing mums breastfeeding			0
' it is of course a natural , essential human process and those with an issue simply need to get over themselves - babies need to be fed when they 're hungry and there 's nothing ostentatious about a mother responding to that need			0
' @entity171 left no doubt that @entity173 disagreed with mr @entity15 's comments , saying that it was ' totally unacceptable ' for mothers to be made to feel uncomfortable when feeding their babies in public			2
protesters : two mothers sit on the pavement outside the @entity181 in an act of defiance proud : two mothers laugh as they breastfeed their babies today in response to the incident at @entity3 's a @entity187 spokeswoman said : ' it 's for mr @entity15 to explain his views			1
' the prime minister shares the view of the @entity192 , which is that breastfeeding is completely natural and it 's totally unacceptable for any women to be made to feel uncomfortable when breast - feeding in public			0
' posting on @entity197 , shadow home secretary @entity196 said : ' after ' that ' interview , @entity15 should sit in a corner ! ' @entity10 ( left ) was told to cover up while breastfeeding in @entity3 's			1
@entity15 ( right ) became embroiled in the row suggesting mothers could ' sit in the corner ' in restaurants to avoid offending people mr @entity15 later issued a statement to clarify his position : ' as i said on the radio , and as i repeat now , i personally have no problem with mothers breastfeeding wherever they want			1
' what i said was - and it is immensely frustrating that i have to explain this - that if the establishment in question , in this case @entity3 , wants to maintain rules about this stuff , then that is up to them , as it should be			0
' i remarked that perhaps they might ask women to sit in a corner			2
did i say i believe they should have to ? no. did i say i personally endorse this concept ? no. snub : one protester strapped a sign to the back of her baby claiming in future she would be breastfeeding at the @entity231 rather than @entity3 's @entity171 left no doubt that @entity173 disagreed with mr @entity15 's comments , saying that it was ' totally unacceptable ' for mothers to be made to feel uncomfortable when breastfeeding ' we do however have to recognise that businesses have a responsibility to all of their customers , some of whom may well be made uncomfortable by public breastfeeding			1
' it 's a two - way street - breastfeeding women should never be embarrassed by staff asking them to stop and most mums will recognise the need to be discreet in certain , limited , circumstances			2
it is just a question of good manners			0
' the 2010 @entity71 makes it unlawful for a business to discriminate against a breastfeeding woman			0
