he has already created history after the first baby was born following a womb transplant			1
now @entity4 hopes to go one step further – by growing wombs from scratch			2
the @entity9 doctor is working on growing a womb in the lab. while it may sound fantastical , teams elsewhere in the world are ‘ making ’ livers , kidneys and even hearts			1
given to young women who are born without one or have theirs removed due to cancer , the new wombs could allow them to achieve their dream of motherhood			1
now he is working on growing wombs from scratch a lab within a decade the world 's first successful womb transplant saw the birth of baby @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity9 , last month after years of tireless research			1
he was born weighing 4lbs the project is still in its infancy , however professor @entity4 envisages taking wombs from dead donors and stripping them of their cells , to leave little more than a living framework			1
this would then be coated with stem cells – ‘ master cells ’ – taken from the young woman ’s body			2
it would then be grown in the lab , before being given to her as a new womb			0
using the woman ’s own cells would mean it would be an exact match for her own body – removing the need for powerful and potentially dangerous immunosuppressant drugs			0
the @entity60 professor has successfully made a rat ’s womb , however , it will be decade before he has a womb ready to put into woman			1
news of the project has emerged just days after professor @entity4 announced that a baby had been born after a womb transplant for the first time anywhere in the world			1
he has been called @entity34 - a name derived from the @entity73 for ' to conquer ' - to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to have him			0
the breakthrough offers hope to childless women around the world , including some 15,000 in the @entity79 alone who were born without a womb or had it removed due to cancer or other illness			1
@entity34 ’s mother carried him in a womb donated to her by a close family friend			1
he is now a month old and a ‘ perfect baby boy ’			0
his mother , who is 36 , was devastated to be told at 15 that she did n’t have a womb			0
she said : ‘ i have always had this large sorrow because i never thought i would be a mother - and now the impossible has become real			0
' @entity34 ’s mother , who has not been named , was one of nine to be given a new womb as part of the pioneering project at @entity60			2
seven of the transplants were successful – and two of the women are just weeks away from giving birth			0
in another world first , the mothers - to - be have been given wombs by their own mothers			0
in other words , each baby is being nurtured in its grandmother ’s womb			2
the extraordinary procedure , which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant , means each womb will have carried two generations of the same family			2
professor @entity4 , who has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques needed for a transplant , says these two pregnancies prove that @entity34 ’s birth was n’t just ‘ pure luck ’			1
@entity120 and his team performing a womb transplant on a woman earlier this year			2
another six women given new wombs are also said to be pregnant he predicts that six of the seven women will become mothers			0
he said : ‘ if that happens , then it ’s a very effective treatment			0
it ’s a costly treatment but it ’s very effective			0
’ news of his success provides a boost for a similar project in the @entity79 in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb			0
however , close to £ 500,000 is needed if the first @entity79 woman is to be operated on next spring or summer			0
@entity139 , a consultant gynaecological surgeon and head of charity @entity141 , described the @entity9 women – including @entity34 ’s mother , as incredibly courageous			1
mr @entity139 said : ‘ it is a big step , setting yourself up for something that is a big step into the unknown			0
’ professor @entity4 said he was more focussed and disciplined than the @entity79 team			1
however , he believes mr @entity139 ’s project will be successful and predicts the first @entity79 womb transplant baby will be born just three years from now .			1
