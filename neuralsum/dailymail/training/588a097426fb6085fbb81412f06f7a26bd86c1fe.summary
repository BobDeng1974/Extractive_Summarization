by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:51 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 19:51 est , 8 december 2012 @entity5 ’s hopes of replacing @entity6 as @entity3 leader have been ‘ buried ’ by his bungled commons onslaught on @entity9 last week , a @entity3 mp claimed last night			1
@entity11 mp @entity10 said the @entity13 ’s lacklustre response to the chancellor ’s @entity14 plans to slash welfare and raise taxes for the well - off had damaged mr @entity5 ’s leadership prospects – and made mr @entity6 ’s position secure			1
mr @entity10 spoke out amid claims that mr @entity5 and his supporters have given up hope that either he or wife , shadow home secretary @entity24 , could succeed mr @entity6			1
poor performance : @entity11 mp @entity10 , left , accused the shadow chancellor @entity5 , right , of giving a lacklustre response to @entity9 's @entity14 plans to cut welfare @entity9 said the plans in his @entity14 would return ' fairness ' to the benefits system instead , they reportedly plan to throw their support behind mr @entity5 ’s deputy , rising @entity3 star @entity34 , in an attempt to defeat mr @entity6 ’s protege , shadow business secretary @entity36 , said to be admired by mr @entity5 ’s @entity38 foe , @entity39			1
mr @entity10 told @entity40 : ‘ any speculation that @entity5 might launch a leadership challenge to @entity6 is dead and buried			1
it is believed unlikely that @entity5 , right , will now challenge @entity6 , left , for the @entity3 leadership ‘ @entity5 failed to defeat @entity9 when @entity9 was by far the most vulnerable @entity45 member			1
' there was a time when it was felt @entity6 was running to catch up with @entity5			1
that ’s reversed in the past year			2
' what happened last week crystallises that change			2
’ and a @entity3 frontbencher added : ‘ the balls brand was built on an aura of invincibility			0
' but against @entity9 last week , he was as nimble as an arthritic elephant			0
' he ’s been holed below the waterline by one speech			0
’ labour politicians also criticised mr @entity5 for claiming his childhood stammer was to blame for fluffing his lines at the start of his commons reply to mr @entity9			2
a former labour cabinet minister said : ‘ everyone admires the way @entity67 has struggled to overcome his stammer			0
' but to blame it for making a poor speech is feeble			0
’ another @entity3 grandee said : ‘ @entity67 ’s response failed because he had no message and no narrative			0
' if the @entity76 had barracked him because of his stammer , it would have been unacceptable , but they did n’t			0
he dishes it out and he must learn how to take it			0

@entity11 mp @entity10 said any speculation over a leadership challenge by @entity5 is ' dead and buried '
