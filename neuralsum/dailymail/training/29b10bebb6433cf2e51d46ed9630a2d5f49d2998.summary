by @entity0 published : 20:32 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 02:27 est , 31 january 2013 one of the world ’s ugliest creatures could hold the key to beating chronic pain , scientists believe			0
the star - nosed mole , which boasts a bizarre snout fringed by 22 waggling tentacles that are highly sensitive to touch , could lead to new painkillers for people whose lives are blighted by arthritis and other conditions that leave them in constant pain			1
the tiny creature , native to @entity17 , lives underground in almost total darkness and so relies on its nose to ‘ see ’			2
potential : the star - nosed mole , which boasts a bizarre snout fringed by 22 waggling tentacles that are highly sensitive to touch , could lead to new painkillers being developed the points of the ‘ star ’ rapidly survey the floors and walls of its tunnels for tasty worms and grubs , much in the same way as a blind person uses a cane to hunt out obstacles			1
after hitting on a tasty morsel , the mole , which weighs less than a bag of sugar , takes just 230 milliseconds to decide if it is edible and gobble it down			0
quicker than the blink of an eye , this is less than half the time a motorists needs to begin braking on seeing a red light , and makes the creatures one of the fastest eaters on the planet			0
the centre of its snout is particularly responsive to touch , with more than 100,000 nerve endings packed into an area one centimetre square , making it the most sensitive patch of mammalian skin known to man			1
now , scientists are starting to unravel the secrets of its remarkable nose , in the hope of helping people whose bodies are extra-sensitive to pain and for whom current drugs offer little benefit			2
a study of star - nosed moles caught in @entity72 pinpointed genes thought to be key to feeling touch and pain			1
receptors : @entity78 researcher @entity77 said : ¿ by studying the star - nosed mole , we have identified candidate genes that may mediate touch and pain ' if the same mechanism is at play in the human body , it be exploited to develop new treatments for persistent pain , the journal @entity85 reports			1
@entity78 researcher @entity77 said : ‘ by studying the star - nosed mole , we have identified candidate genes that may mediate touch and pain			1
‘ these genes represent new potential targets for the development of much - needed drugs and therapies to treat chronic pain			2
’ chronic pain often takes the form of headaches , back ache or neck pain and can be caused by an injury , cancer or arthritis			0
however , it some cases , it has no obvious cause			0
millions of @entity112 suffer pain almost daily , with almost 8 million working days a year lost to back ache alone .			0

creature *'s* snout has 22 waggling tentacles packed with nerve - endings
@entity78 said they found genes in nose that *detect* pain
nose is thought to be most sensitive patch of mammalian skin known to man
