by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 18:17 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 03:18 est , 12 february 2013 the birth rate in the @entity4 has reached record lows in 2011 , new data shows			1
information from the @entity8 shows that only 13 women per 1,000 gave birth between 2010 and 2011 , the lowest its been since a peak in 1991			1
teen births are also down , with only three percent of teenagers aged 15 - 19 giving birth between that time , or to approximately 31.3 births per 1,000 women			1
falling : teen birth rates have gone down along with the overall @entity4 birth rate in part because of better sexual education and because of the sour economy on the other end of the spectrum , the birth rate increased for women in their 30s and 40s increased by three percent in that time			1
the @entity8 ’s data was published monday in the journal @entity29 , and shows that birth rates among young women in their 20s also fell from 90 births per 1,000 women in 2010 to 85.3 births in 2011			1
@entity8 statistician @entity35 , the lead author of the new report , said that the economy could be one factor for delaying having children			2
' the economy has declined , and that certainly is a factor that goes into people 's decisions about having a child , ' he said			2
' women may say to themselves , ‘ it 's not a particularly good time right now … let 's wait a little bit , '' he told @entity2			2
data shows that birth rates declined drastically during the @entity49 , with women having on average one less child each in the decade that followed			1
and while the birth rate again climbed in the 1950s and 60s , the @entity53 leveled out birth rates to approximately two children per woman			1
the @entity58 has led to stunted career growth , financial uncertainty older women , however , are typically more secure in their employment , he said - and understand that they do n't have as long to wait if they want to get pregnant			0
@entity35 and his colleagues calculated that 3.6 million more babies would have been born to women in that age group over the last two decades had the teen birth rate not been falling since a peak in 1991			1
downturn : birth rates routinely fall during periods of economic downturn , as evidenced after the @entity49 , the @entity74 , and now on the heels of the @entity58 decline : @entity47 also shows that the number of children women are having is going down for @entity79 and black women on the other end of the spectrum , the birth rate among 35 - to 39 - year - olds increased by three percent over 2010 figures			1
in 2011 , 4.7 percent of women in their late 30s and just over one percent in their early 40s had a baby , the @entity8 team found			1
another reason for the lower birth rates could be due to better sex education for young people			0
' the economy has declined , and that certainly is a factor that goes into people 's decisions about having a child			0
' the @entity100 said in their updated guide for teens that @entity103 and hormonal implants should be the first line of defence over more traditional methods like condoms and birth control pills			0
the @entity103 and implants both require a visit to the doctor ’s office and are much more costly than other methods			0
however , they are also the most effective forms of birth control available , save for abstinence			0
other results from the vital statistics report showed a continued decline in babies born prematurely or small , and an unchanged rate of infant deaths			0
black and @entity124 mothers continued to be more likely to have a premature baby than white women , but rates declined among all races			0
infant mortality was more than twice as high among babies born to black mothers as in babies of white moms , death records showed			0
@entity35 said the decline in teen births , in particular , is especially ' welcome news ' and reflects the efforts of programs and policies targeting that age group			2
' it 's definitely consistent with the trends that we 've seen , and it 's obviously good news overall , ' said dr @entity145 , who studies teen pregnancy at the @entity147 in @entity148			2
' i think the main thing behind this is increased contraceptive use , and better contraceptive use , ' dr @entity145 , who was n't involved in the new research , told @entity2 .			0

@entity4 birth rate is lowest it 's been since peak in 1991
@entity8 data shows that there were only 13 live births per 1,000 women between 2010 and 2011
teen birth rate also down to 31.3 births per 1,000 women
economic woes and better contraceptive *options* helped shape trend
