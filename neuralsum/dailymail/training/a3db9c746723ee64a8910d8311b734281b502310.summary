by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 despite appearances to the contrary , @entity2 actually have two centre forwards capable of troubling @entity6 in @entity7 on thursday			1
@entity8 and his players have every reason to fear @entity12 ’s @entity11 when the teams meet in their second match in @entity15 certainly @entity11 ’s recovery from recent knee surgery is fundamental to the @entity19 ’ chances here			1
however , playing up front when @entity2 begin their @entity21 in @entity22 against @entity23 on saturday afternoon will be @entity25 ’s formidable goalscorer @entity24 - and the 27 - year - old has admitted that he is driven on by his rivalry with @entity11			1
‘ we want to be in the best condition possible to help our country			2
it ’s a dream we both share			0
‘ in the past four years we ’ve improved and matured as a partnership			0
we ’ve both done very good things this season			0
we ’ve been working hard for a long time to achieve our objectives for @entity2			1
connection : @entity24 and @entity11 's fathers played in the same local leagye in the north - west of @entity2 ‘ we hope that can continue this summer because we want to do well for our country , for our people , and to keep our position as one of the highest ranked teams in the world			1
@entity11 has been phenomenal this season			1
’ born in the same month in the north - western town of @entity59 , @entity11 and @entity24 never knew each other as children , even though their fathers played in the same local league			1
over the next month , though , it ’s hard to escape the sense that they must present the best side of their partnership if they are to progress from a group that also contains @entity72			0
‘ no , we did n’t know each other as children , but our fathers did , ’ explained @entity24			2
‘ they actually played football together in @entity59 ’s local leagues when they were younger , before me and @entity11 were born			2
@entity11 left for the capital , @entity80 , to play football when he was very small , so our paths did n’t cross on the pitch until we were playing in @entity2 ’s youth teams			1
‘ we ’re both boys from @entity59 , though , and we know every nook and cranny of the place			2
we ’ve grown up with those customs and habits and it ’s a big part of who we are			0
’ @entity24 first came to @entity93 ’s attention as a buccaneering striker for @entity95 in @entity97 @entity96 tracked him closely before he moved to @entity98 with @entity25 last summer			2
more recently , @entity99 considered a bid for him , though that interest has cooled a little under new @entity103 manager @entity102			0
with @entity6 ’s central defensive partnership of @entity109 and @entity110 arguably the weakest part of their line - up , it is possible @entity2 may leave @entity11 out of saturday night ’s game to protect his knee ahead of next week ’s second @entity15 match			1
‘ this is a tough group , absolutely , ’ said @entity24 , who has scored 21 times in 62 international appearances			2
‘ but you ’d expect that from a @entity21			0
it will be both difficult and beautiful at the same time , because if you can compete with the best in the world and challenge them for the @entity122 — not necessarily even winning it - then that ’s a very attractive proposition			0
‘ to win a @entity21 you have to maintain a level of concentration whereby you face the best teams in the world by playing to your maximum			0
‘ we know our first three games are going to be elite , top			0
the competition is going to be fierce from the beginning , but that only makes it more beautiful to play in this tournament , because you have to bring your best face as early as possible			0
’ on your marks : @entity2 warm up in @entity22 ahead of their @entity15 clash with @entity23			1

@entity24 will look to lead the line in place of @entity11
@entity11 is recovering from knee surgery but will miss game against @entity23
@entity24 *enjoys* *friendly* rivalry with his @entity2 strike partner
