anyone who studies for a phd can expect it to involve a lot of hard work			0
but few students can claim to have completed an assignment as tough as this - catching a crocodile bigger than a car			2
@entity9 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , was part of a 12 - man team which caught the animal - the largest crocodile ever to be tagged and released back into the wild			1
haul : @entity18 student @entity9 was part of a 12 - man team which caught this 5.2 - metre crocodile , the largest ever to be satellite - tagged and released back into the wild giant : @entity9 ( left ) , of @entity10 , @entity11 , measures the massive crocodile before releasing it to the wild the crocodile , called @entity27 , is 5.2m long , weighs more than a ton and was caught in @entity29 , near the @entity31 region of @entity33 @entity32			1
mr @entity9 , 24 , travelled to the country to study saltwater crocodiles and to trap and tag them with sat - nav technology so that scientists can follow their movements			1
the scheme is a joint project involving three organisations - the @entity44 department , the @entity45 ( @entity46 ) and @entity47			2
mr @entity9 and fellow volunteers dragged the male crocodile to shore and held it down while it was tagged			1
the animal was then released			0
experts believe @entity53 is the largest tagged crocodile in the world			1
effort : twelve volunteers were involved in the operation to haul the crocodile ashore for tagging massive : the crocodile , called @entity62 , is 5.2m long , weighs more than a ton and was caught in the @entity64 , near the @entity31 region of @entity33 @entity32 two other crocodiles have been tagged as part of the project - in june last year and in january - but they were smaller and scientists were only able to monitor them for about two months each			1
mr @entity9 said : ' when we first saw the crocodile , it was in a trap and it was clear to me that it was going to measure more than five metres			2
' the feeling was pure excitement			0
these are the kind of days that make me love my phd			0
' it 's the third crocodile we have tagged in the @entity64 in @entity31 and this one was considerably larger than the other two			2
' it eclipses the previous record of 4.65 metres , carried out in @entity89			0
' we hope that by mapping the reptile 's nesting locations , it will show us how habitats decline and how human intervention is affecting the reptile 's behaviour			2
' teamwork : the scheme is a joint project involving three organisations - the @entity44 department , the @entity45 ( @entity46 ) and @entity47 colossal : two other crocodiles have been tagged as part of the project - in june last year and in january - but they were smaller and scientists were only able to monitor them for about two months each hold still : men sit on the crocodile to keep it in position for tagging			1
scientists will use satellite technology to monitor the animal 's movements team leader @entity115 said : ' we needed more than 10 men to pull @entity27 out of the trap and carry it to the river bank where we measured it and collared the satellite tag on its neck			1
' it was teamwork and we enjoyed the challenge			0
' datuk dr @entity126 , @entity44 director , said : ' we were a bit unlucky with the two previous males tagged in june last year , and january , with the tags lasting for only two months			0
' hopefully , this tag will last longer and will provide important data on the crocodile 's movements and home ranges			1
' @entity46 director dr @entity135 said there were plans to tag several more crocodiles			0
he said : ' in three days , @entity53 had already travelled 5km and moved away from @entity46			0
it seems to be a transient reptile , rather than a resident			0
' project : a director of the @entity45 said there were plans to tag several more crocodiles research : scientists hope that , by mapping the reptile 's nesting locations , they will learn how habitats decline tale of the tape : @entity53 is 5.2m long , bigger than the previous record for a tagged crocodile - a 4.65m reptile caught in @entity89			1

@entity9 was *member* of team which hauled in 5.2 - metre reptile
crocodile was fitted tag before being released back into the wild
scientists will monitor crocodile 's movements in @entity33 @entity32
experts believe it is the largest tagged crocodile in the world
