landmark ruling : president of the @entity3 sir @entity2 decisions by secret courts that can lead to children being taken from their parents or old people forced into care homes are finally to be opened up to public scrutiny			1
under rules set out yesterday , future judgments in the family courts and the @entity13 must be made public except in cases where there is a clear reason to dictate they should not be			1
councils applying to take children into care or to take control of the lives of the old and sick can no longer hide behind a cloak of anonymity			1
expert witnesses , including social workers , should also be named in public , as should anyone found responsible for wrongdoing			1
the landmark changes break a silence that has surrounded family justice for nearly 100 years			0
they also mark a major victory for the @entity36 which has campaigned against secret courts and exposed a series of major scandals over the past year resulting from justice being conducted behind closed doors			1
the new rules , laid down by the most senior family judge , @entity42 sir @entity2 , say that judgments in the family courts and the @entity13 must always be publicised unless there are ‘ compelling reasons ’ why not			1
only children and adults caught up in disputes and members of their families should be protected by anonymity			2
the guidelines warn that secrecy prevents families who have been involved in cases from complaining when they believe they have suffered injustice			0
sir @entity2 said in guidance sent to judges that there would be ‘ an immediate and significant change in practice in relation to the publication of judgments in family courts and the @entity13 ’			1
the @entity3 ruled the woman should not be told of social workers plans to take her baby after birth he added : ‘ in both courts there is a need for greater transparency in order to improve public understanding of the court process and confidence in the court system			1
‘ at present too few judgments are made available to the public , which has a legitimate interest in being able to read what is being done by judges in its name			2
’ the @entity36 ’s campaign revealed last april that the @entity13 – set up by the last @entity92 government to deal with the affairs of those too ill to make decisions for themselves – had jailed a woman in secret and without publishing any record			1
a @entity99 judge imprisoned @entity100 , 50 , for contempt of court for trying to get her father out of a care home where he had been ordered to stay			0
miss @entity100 had no lawyer to represent her , and no judgment was published			0
in december we revealed how an @entity108 mother who had been forced by the @entity13 to have a caesarean begged a family court judge in vain to allow her to keep her baby			2
everything that happened to the mother , @entity113 , was decided by the courts in secret			0
in the same month we disclosed the case of the ‘ irreproachable ’ father who spent 12 years and £ 100,000 in the family courts trying to win the right to see his 14 - year - old daughter – and who still has not won his case for access			0
currently , secrecy in the family courts – which can remove children from dangerous parents , order them to be adopted , and decide on their custody – is governed by 1960 law			0
this makes it contempt of court to discuss a case when no judgment has been published , a crime punishable by two years in prison			0
successive attempts to open up the courts have been thwarted			0
in 2006 , @entity92 lord chancellor @entity140 blocked a law that would have allowed more light in because state - subsidised charities such as the @entity144 and the @entity145 opposed the idea			0
@entity92 ’s @entity147 , pushed through by @entity140 , set up the @entity13			2
its rules say ‘ the general rule is that a hearing is to be held in private ’			0
sir @entity2 , who took over a year ago as @entity42 , which includes responsibility for both courts , said his new guidance would take effect from february 3			1
he added that further guidance and formal legal practice directions will follow			0
there may yet be full @entity159 legislation , although sir @entity2 said this is ‘ unlikely in the near future			1
’ he said that current rules are ‘ inappropriate where family members wish to discuss their experiences in public , identifying themselves and making use of the judgement			2
‘ equally , they may be inappropriate in cases where findings have been made against a person and the court concludes it is in the public interest for that person to be identified			2

@entity177 and @entity13 judgements will now be made public
expert witnesses , including social workers , are to be named
councils applying to take children into care can no longer claim anonymity
new rules laid down by @entity42 sir @entity2
@entity36 has exposed a series of major scandals over the past year
these have resulted from justice being conducted behind closed doors
