a female anthropologist who spent six years working as a stripper while researching a book about strip clubs says she came to the conclusion that the establishments can actually help save marriages			1
@entity7 , who is based in @entity8 , interviewed 30 of her regular customers at the several strip clubs in which she workd to write @entity11 and @entity12 : @entity13 , a book about the relationship between strippers and their customers , which was adapted from her @entity19 dissertation			1
she also debunked the myth that stripping leaves dancers and customers with unrealistic body image ideals , saying that the clubs proved to her that men have a far wider range of tastes when it comes to female bodies - far wider than women believe			1
nonetheless , the academic says she still would n't want her husband visiting strip clubs regularly - because it 's too expensive a hobby			1
anthropologist @entity7 spent six years working as a stripper while researching a book about strip clubs , and says she came to the conclusion that the establishments can actually help save marriages speaking to @entity44 on @entity45 , @entity43 explains how one of the chapters in her book - the @entity46 : marriage , @entity51 , and @entity52 - she contradicts the popular belief that a man 's ability to be intimate with his wife is eroded by such clubs , attesting that clubs in which she worked actually held together the marriages of many of the regulars she interviewed			1
explaining that most of her interviewees were married , @entity43 said : ' for the men who said that they were in love with their wives and wanted to stay married , what happened in the clubs was transgressive and real enough to be exciting , but was still a fantasy			1
' in the chapter “ the @entity46 , ” i really wanted to question the whole idea of true intimacy			1
what does that even mean ? ' that said , when asked whether or not she would mind her husband visiting the clubs regularly , @entity76 said she would - but mostly because of the money			1
she said : ' honestly , i would n’t like it ! for me , a lot of it is about the money - i do n’t have the disposable income to spend on that kind of entertainment , and if he did have that kind of extra money , i ’d want it to be fair			1
' maybe if i could spend dollar for dollar somewhere else , but unfortunately , there are n't yet places where women can go pay hot young men to stroke their egos			2
that may come in the future			2
' @entity43 says she had ' really positive experiences ' dancing , and learned that men have a ' much more varied perception of what sort of bodies are beautiful or sexy than a lost of women ' @entity43 , who says she is a feminist , also became sympathetic toward her regulars at the clubs			2
she said : ' talking to the guys in the strip clubs , i realized that they were damaged by the sexist culture , too			2
' they felt repellent , that their wives and girlfriends could never accept their desires and that they could never ask advice about sex because they were supposed to somehow know everything			0
' these guys were struggling with how to deal with what they saw as women ’s conflicting demands for both traditional masculine traits and more emotional presence			0
' they were also confused by women ’s desire to be called beautiful but not be objectified			0
' @entity76 said : ' i had really positive experiences dancing			0
i learned that men have a much more varied perception of what sort of bodies are beautiful or sexy than a lot of women think they do ' @entity43 also said stripping gave her more self - confidence and positively affected her attitude towards body image - mainly because she discovered that men have a much wider set of values for what constitutes a beautiful or sexy female body than women themselves do			0
she said : ' i had really positive experiences dancing			0
i learned that men have a much more varied perception of what sort of bodies are beautiful or sexy than a lot of women think they do			0
' the upper - tier clubs had less variety than the lower - tier clubs			0
but even in the upscale clubs , you ’ll see more variety of shapes and sizes than you ’d see in a @entity165 or a @entity166			0
' i had stereotyped men as wanting something narrow , when in fact they have a wide variety of tastes			0
