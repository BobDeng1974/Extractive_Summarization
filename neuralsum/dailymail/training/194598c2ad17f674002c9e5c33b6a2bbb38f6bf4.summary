forget planking , get over owling , this is the hot new posing craze sweeping the internet - putting your breasts on things			1
mamming as it 's known is aimed at both women and men and involves resting your bust on random objects			1
it 's the brainchild of @entity13 and @entity14 who wanted to inspire women to take action and get a mammogram early if they suspect a problem			1
now ad agency executive @entity14 , from @entity26 , has seen her idea go global as more and more people take to the internet to post their ' mamming ' poses			1
she said : ‘ overall the response has been very positive , although there have been some people wondering how a campaign like this is going to “ cure ” breast cancer			2
clean act : the idea is to keep things ' pg ' and not bare too much flesh chest file it : the photographs are all sent to @entity54 which urges people to ' embrace the awkwardness ' the creators wanted to break through the clutter of @entity59 ‘ when i was sick , i asked my doctors about a cure - one actually told me that the best cure we have is prevention			2
‘ prevention is screening like mammograms and self - exams and they are the best tool we have to catch cancer early , and catching it early is how we beat it			2
‘ we would love to see mamming become as big on the web as planking and owling			2
part of the reason that we love mamming as a vehicle for spreading awareness is because it taps into an existing trend that is really fun and relevant to everyone			0
the creators of mamming say that it taps into an existing trend - and is great fun the creator of the mamming initiative ( not pictured ) was a breast cancer survivor and she knows early detection is vital to fight the killer disease bra - vo : this mamming participant has decided to post a rather fruity picture @entity96 's the word : the photographs are a way of women showing solidarity with those having to have mammograms ‘ our goal was to create something fun that would break through the clutter of breast cancer awareness month			1
we 've seen breast cancer awareness campaigns that use humour and sexuality , and ones that do n't mention mammograms or breasts at all			0
‘ we wanted to do something that focused on the woman as being responsible for her breasts and her health			0
overall , we hope that mamming reminds women to get screened , and maybe makes them feel a little less awkward about putting their boobs in the mammogram machine			1
‘ we hope people will keep it @entity48 , but the only real rule is to make your mam awesome			0
we love seeing people get really creative			0
