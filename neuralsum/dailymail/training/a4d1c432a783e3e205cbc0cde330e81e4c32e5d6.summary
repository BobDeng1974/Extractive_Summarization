by @entity0 a lot physically separates the sexes , but all of these differences depend on one single element – the y chromosome			0
researchers have long held the belief that the @entity9 were once identical , until the @entity10 began to evolve and differentiate from the x in males - although the timing of this change was unknown			1
now scientists from @entity16 claim the first ‘ sex genes ’ appeared in mammals around 180 million years ago and may have been caused by changes in global temperature			1
researchers have long held the belief the @entity11 , pictured left , and @entity10 , pictured right , chromosome were once identical , until the @entity10 evolved and differentiated itself , but the timing of this change was unknown			1
now scientists claim ‘ sex genes ’ appeared 180 million years ago and may have been caused by changes in global temperature researchers from @entity28 have discovered that despite its dramatic decay , the y chromosome has preserved a small set of genes over millions of years that have ensured the survival of men			1
and most have little , if any , role in sex determination or sperm production			0
instead , they have been discovered to play a vital role in determining the differences between the sexes in terms of health and disease			0
the findings , published in the journal nature , suggest these y - linked genes could be contributing to differences in how susceptible the different sexes are to disease , and how severely it affects them			0
by studying samples from several male tissues - taken predominantly from the testicles of different mammal species - researchers from the @entity60 's @entity59 took the y chromosome genes from the three major mammal lines			2
these included placentals , such as humans , apes , rodents and elephants ; marsupials such as opossums and kangaroos ; and monotremes - egg - laying mammals which include the platypus and the echidna			0
in total , the researchers worked with samples from 15 different mammals , representing these three lineages , as well as the chicken , which they included for comparison			1
instead of sequencing these y chromosomes , the scientists compared genetic sequences from male and female tissues			2
from this they were able to eliminate all sequences common to both sexes in order to keep only those sequences corresponding to the y chromosome			0
researchers from the @entity60 studied the y chromosome genes from the three major mammal lines			2
these included placentals , such as humans and elephants , pictured left ; marsupials such as opossums and kangaroos , pictured right ; and egg - laying mammals which include the platypus and the echidna by doing so , they established the largest gene atlas of the male chromosome to date			0
the study shows that the same sex - determining gene , named @entity106 , in placentals and marsupials had formed in the common ancestor of both lineages around 180 million years ago			1
another gene , called @entity111 , is responsible for the emergence of @entity85 in monotremes and appeared 175 million years ago			1
both genes , which according to researcher professor @entity115 are ‘ involved in testicular development , ’ and emerged ‘ nearly at the same time but in a totally independent way			0
’ the scientists believe the trigger may have been linked to other sex chromosomes , or environmental factors such as the temperature			2
for example , temperature determines sex in present - day crocodiles and may have played a role 180 million years ago .			1

researchers have long held the belief x and y chromosomes were identical
the @entity10 then evolved and differentiated , but the timing of this was unknown
scientists from @entity16 now claim the first ‘ sex genes ’ appeared in mammals around 180 million years ago
they studied the genome sequencing using samples from 15 mammals
