by @entity0 @entity2 scientists have developed a forecast model that they claim will be able to predict extreme winter weather with up to 80 per cent accuracy			1
if accurate , it could strongly influence the economy , with advanced warnings giving airports , councils , insurers and hospitals more information with which to prepare			0
the breakthrough comes after the @entity15 was criticised for its ‘ pitiful ’ forecasts last winter – thought to be the worst predictions since @entity19 ’s infamous reassurance that there was no hurricane on the way in october 1987			1
stuff of legend : @entity19 famously failed to predict the 1987 hurricane - but he relied on others ' data last november , the @entity15 told councils to expect ‘ drier than usual ’ conditions – only for the @entity2 to suffer the wettest winter since records began			1
until now , even powerful super-computers have been able to perform only slightly better than chance when predicting long - term weather conditions			2
but the latest model , which simulates the climate on a more detailed scale , was found to be 62 per cent accurate at broad predictions of weather conditions when it was tested on 20 years of retrospective data			1
and scientists at the @entity15 claim the reliability will improve , estimating that accuracy will increase to 80 per cent			1
the breakthrough is due to stronger computing power , allowing scientists to take into account much smaller changes in the gulfstream and @entity50 sea ice coverage , which impact on the @entity2 climate			0
the @entity15 ’s @entity53 said : ‘ this will have enormous benefits for the economy and society , and mean that planners can prepare well ahead for winter			1
’ dramatic : a stormy winter this year followed wrongly - placed reassurances from the @entity15 airports and councils would have a better idea how much grit would be needed , while power companies and wind farms would be able to anticipate energy demands , and hospitals could prepare for increases of accidents caused by the ice and snow			1
and after the wettest winter on record , insurers would be able to estimate the potential risks of winter storms			0
it is also a huge boon for the @entity15 , which has been highly embarrassed in the past by its seasonal predictions			2
in 2009 , it forecast a ‘ barbecue summer ’ , which proved to be a washout			0
and last november , a three - month forecast by the @entity15 suggested only the @entity86 and @entity87 might expect average rainfall			2
the forecasters told councils there would be a ‘ significant reduction in precipitation compared to average ’ for most of the country			0
instead , local authorities saw some of the most severe flooding in decades			0
professor @entity99 said : ‘ if used carefully there ’s a good chance of winning , but no guarantee			0
‘ it ’s not possible to predict the outcome every year but we ’re doing it with increasing skill			0

scientists developed new model to forecast weather months in advance
it comes after @entity15 was criticised for ' pitiful ' forecasts last winter
model had 62 **%** accuracy on *historic* data which could rise to 80 **%** in *future*
