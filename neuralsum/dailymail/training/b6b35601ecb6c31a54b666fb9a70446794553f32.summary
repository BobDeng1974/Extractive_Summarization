by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 12:06 est , 25 october 2012 it is not every day you drive 120 miles without noticing a sleeping cat inside the dashboard			1
but bus driver @entity5 did just that - mistaking the animal 's soft purring noise for the engine			1
it was only after mr @entity5 stripped the panels from the vehicle that he found the stowaway kitten sleeping peacefully			1
@entity5 found the kitten in his dashboard after driving 120 miles mr @entity5 had spent the day driving the bus on his 120 - mile standard route across @entity17 , @entity18 to neighbouring towns on october 11			1
after several passengers had reported hearing a strange noise , mr @entity5 stopped several times and searched under all the seats - but to no avail			1
he looked inside the engine - thinking the purring sound was perhaps coming from there - but still could n't find its source			2
he returned to his depot after his five - hour round trip and as a last resort started to remove the vehicle 's panels			1
mr @entity5 , of @entity34 , eventually found the problem when he removed the dashboard panel			1
he said : ' when cars pass you they make a whooshing noise and it sounded like a miaow			0
i thought i was going mental			0
' i stopped several times to look around the bus but i could n't find anything			0
' every time i stopped the kitten stopped making a noise			2
i could n't tell where it was coming from , but it had quite a voice			0
a stroke of @entity54 : driver @entity5 strokes @entity55 the cat mr @entity5 started taking the panels off the bus when he got it back to the depot in a bid to find the noise ' i was pleased i found it , because it proved i was n't going mad			1
' sorry , i 'm in a dash : driver @entity5 with stowaway kitten lucky beside the front of the bus he had to take apart he said in the morning he had found two kittens had jumped onto the bus overnight but they had run off and he thinks the third was part of the same litter			1
@entity75 , who works in the @entity77 's @entity34 office , has now adopted the kitten - and called him @entity55			2
she said : ' we could n't believe he 'd been trundling around all day			0
he was actually feral and bit and scratched me , but he 's calmed down a bit			2
' there are a couple of feral cats that live around the depot , and we think his mum must have taken @entity55 and the other kittens into the bus to keep dry			0
' the driver had left the door open on the bus so they must have got in there			0
and in the morning the drivers coming in must have scared them and they rushed off			0
' but @entity55 must have gone the wrong way and somehow ended up in the dash			0
' @entity55 seemed none the worse for the ordeal .			0

@entity5 drove 120 miles with the kitten in the dashboard
he ripped away the vehicle 's panels after his five - hour *journey*
