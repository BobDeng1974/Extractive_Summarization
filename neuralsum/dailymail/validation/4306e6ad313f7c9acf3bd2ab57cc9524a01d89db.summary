a new @entity1 study may make you think twice about biting into a piece of lettuce			2
scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive – and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them			1
the discovery was made after tests on the @entity12 plant found it can distinguish between insects eating it based on the way they chew and drool			1
' what surprised us was how different plant responses were to each of the caterpillars and aphids			2
the plants could clearly tell insects apart - they really seem to " know " who 's attacking			2
' professor @entity28 exposed a group of @entity12 , which is part of the cabbage family , to cabbage butterfly caterpillars and beet army worms			1
she predicted that as the insects eat the plant , @entity12 could tell by the chewing motion and the drool whether the creature was a butterfly or a worm			1
@entity28 ( left ) and @entity55 ( right ) previously conducted a study that found plants can identify sounds nearby , such as the sound of eating , and then react to the threats in their environment she also believed that the plant could tell several different insects apart , even when they were eating the leaves simultaneously			1
to test her theory , she harvested the chewed up @entity12 , extracted the genes , and froze it in a laboratory			2
plants attempt to defend themselves using different methods , such as giving off spicy flavours and rancid smells			0
these defences are expressed in their genes			0
researchers in @entity76 , @entity77 , found plants give off a gas when under ' attack '			1
super-sensitive microphones picked up a ' bubbling ' sound from a healthy plant			0
but this rose to a piercing screech when it was under threat			0
even a tiny insect bite could have an effect			0
' the more a plant is subjected to stress , the louder the signal , ' said dr @entity92			0
plants do not actually scream in pain			0
but different sounds are heard when the gas they emit , ethylene , is bombarded with lasers			0
the research could help to work out which pieces of fruit and vegetables are likely to stay fresh longer , as a cucumber which is starting to go off produces a squealing sound			0
it could then be separated from the fresher ones			0
based on the gene analysis , professor @entity28 found that the plant can sense when a caterpillar is drooling and provides a different defence mechanism , than if it sensed a butterfly			2
there were also different genetic responses to each worm , showing that the plant knew what was eating it			1
professor @entity28 hopes that this will allow scientists to breed plants that are naturally insect resistant rather than spraying them with pesticides			2
the research builds on a study last year that found plants can identify sounds nearby , such as the sound of eating , and then react to the threats in their environment			1
in this study , caterpillars were placed on @entity12			1
using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant , scientists measured the movement of the leaf in response to the chewing caterpillar			1
professor @entity28 then played back recordings of caterpillar feeding vibrations to one set of plants , but played back only silence to the other set of plants			0
when caterpillars later fed on both sets of plants , the researchers found that the plants previously exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils , a chemical that is unappealing to many caterpillars			1
' what is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations , including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defences , ' co-author @entity55 , said			1
' this indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding vibrations from other common sources of environmental vibration			0

scientists exposed the @entity12 plant to caterpillars and worms
they found caterpillars produce more drool when eating a plant leaf
genetic tests on plant revealed it responded to caterpillars differently
the plant could even tell various caterpillars apart , the scientists found
previous study found plants can identify nearby sounds , such as eating
