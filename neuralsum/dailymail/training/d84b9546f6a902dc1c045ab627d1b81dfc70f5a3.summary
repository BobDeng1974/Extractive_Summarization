ms @entity3 , now 33 , maintains that the former @entity17 chief tried to rape her in a @entity18 flat in 2003			1
judges agreed that she had been sexually assaulted but - because the statute of limitations for such a crime in @entity4 is three years - police stopped investigating last week			2
ms @entity3 said she was satisfied that mr @entity7 ’s status as a ‘ sex attacker ’ had been proved , and that she had achieved a legal ‘ victory ’			1
‘ police recognised that he assaulted me but can not charge him , ’ ms @entity3 told the @entity29 tv station in @entity18			0
‘ this means he is officially a sex attacker , and officially i am not a liar			0
my status as a victim has been established and i am dropping my action			0

i advise him above all to keep a low profile			1
' under fire : @entity7 , pictured leaving a polling station in @entity18 on sunday , was accused of trying to rape ms @entity3 in 2003 this is the second time in three months the former @entity17 chief has been cleared of sex charges			1
in august , @entity49 prosecutors dropped charges that he had raped a maid in a @entity53 hotel room in @entity54 first spoke out after mr @entity7 was arrested on charges of attempting to rape a maid at the @entity57 in @entity58 prosecutors eventually dropped the charges after finding the cleaner , 32 - year - old @entity62 , had told a number of @entity64 just 24 hours later , mr @entity7 was implicated in an investigation into underage prostitution			1

mr @entity7 strenuously denied miss @entity3 ’s claims			1
' eight years ago , the pig stole my life , ' writes ms @entity3 at the beginning of ' @entity99 ' ( ' @entity100 ' )			2
ms @entity3 refers continually to the alleged crime in her 126 - page book , but leaves out the name of mr @entity7			1
this is a common tactic adopted by @entity4 authors as they try to avoid libel charges relating to what they have written			0
despite this , publicity for the book makes it perfectly clear that the book is auto - biographical			0
