within minutes of the final whistle at every @entity3 tie , the two managers are in possession of a full statistical analysis of the match			1
sadly , the temptation is still to look at the scoreline			0
at the sharp end of @entity13 football @entity11 teams can not keep the ball			2
on the continent , this is considered to be a crime			0
it is the primary reason all four @entity11 teams - @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 - were eliminated from the @entity3 before the quarter - final draw			1
@entity22 's players leave the @entity25 looking glum after being eliminated from @entity3 @entity26 stole the show on wednesday , taking 116 touches , 42 more than any other @entity22 player @entity22 had goalkeeper @entity30 to thank for keeping the score to just one at the @entity25 @entity26 joins in the celebrations with goalscorer @entity34 and @entity35 during the first half will we ever learn ? probably not			1
over two legs in the @entity3 second round , @entity22 did not have a single player who touched the ball on more than 74 occasions			1
where was @entity45 ? where was @entity47 ? where was @entity49 ? nowhere , absolutely nowhere			0
in the @entity25 on wednesday , when @entity50 won 1 - 0 and it would not have flattered them had they scored eight , nine or 10 , @entity26 touched the ball 116 times			1
that ’s what we are in the game for , to be spellbound by players who want to make things happen with a clever twist or spin or flick			0
at the @entity64 , when @entity50 won 2 - 1 in the first leg , @entity26 settled for 107 in the @entity67 champions ’ backyard			1
@entity69 was @entity22 ’s highest with 64			2
@entity70 always encouraged his players to ‘ be the boss of the ball ’ when he was head coach at @entity74			0
@entity11 football still looks to be terrified of it			2
former @entity74 manager @entity70 always encouraged his players to ' be the boss of the ball ' @entity79 's @entity78 are joint top for passing accuracy with @entity50 ( 89.2 per cent ) this season to those who followed the fortunes of the four @entity11 teams in the @entity3 , it will not come as a surprise to anyone that none of them are in the top five for passing accuracy			1
@entity50 , who toyed with @entity22 during wednesday ’s 1 - 0 victory in the second leg , are joint top with @entity79 ’s @entity78 ( 89.2 per cent )			1
@entity95 come 10 - time champions @entity96 ( 88.3 ) , followed by @entity98 ( 88.1 ) and another team entrenched in the obsession with possession , @entity99 ( 87.5 )			2
the elite teams rely on possession , keeping the ball in circulation until they can carve out an opening and move in for the kill			0
we will hear some tripe over the next few days , with people convinced that we must continue to refine a mangled , hybrid system to suit @entity11 football			2
well 40 years in and it ’s not working			0
@entity21 were dumped out on tuesday despite being favourably drawn against @entity113 in the last 16 @entity114 saw his @entity21 side crash out of the @entity3 despite a 2 - 0 win in the second leg our national team went out of a @entity119 in @entity120 without even winning a game because they could n’t keep the ball in an average group comprising @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			1
at @entity131 , even with some of weakest teams in @entity13 football at the table , @entity127 will fail dismally because of their inability to retain possession			0
our @entity3 teams are heading the same way because they are incapable of flipping between the demands of the @entity67 and the tactical subtleties of @entity13 football			2
at this point there will be those who cite the classic counter-attacking teams , such as @entity143 ’s @entity142 ( 2010 ) and @entity144 ’s @entity20 ( 2012 ) , who went on to win the @entity3			1
they are the exception , not the rule			0
@entity50 ’s chasing of @entity150 in @entity151 ( 2009 ) and the more humiliating defeat at @entity153 ( 2011 ) was another wake - up call for @entity11 football			1
sadly , we forgot to set the alarm			0
talk to @entity50 ’s players and they are happy to share the secrets of the @entity3 , the magic formula that has been refined over the years at their training ground on the outskirts of the city			1
@entity20 were eliminated by @entity98 despite @entity143 's side having a one - man advantage for 90 minutes @entity166 celebrates after his header took the tie to extra-time before @entity98 went through on away goals @entity171 ' @entity19 were sent crashing out at the group stage of the @entity3 a dejected @entity173 slumps to the floor after a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity177 sealed @entity19 's fate ‘ when we have the ball we keep it at all costs , ’ admitted @entity179 ahead of wednesday ’s second leg at the @entity25 against @entity182 ’s team			1
‘ and when we lose it , we do everything we can to win it back			0
’ @entity179 has won the @entity3 three times - in 2006 , 2009 and 2011 - since he broke into the @entity50 team under the @entity192 coach @entity191			1
@entity194 ’s @entity119 winner knows his stuff			0
@entity50 have two speed settings - quick , and very quick - and their entire system is designed to provoke the opposition into making mistakes			2
@entity22 routinely gave the ball away within five seconds			2
@entity21 ( 57.1 per cent ) are the only @entity11 team to feature in the top five clubs who keep the ball in the @entity3 this season			1
in the @entity205 on tuesday they moved through the gears , with @entity207 ( 141 touches ) and @entity209 ( 126 ) running the show in their impressive 2 - 0 victory			0
@entity127 failed to make it out of their modest @entity119 group in @entity120 last summer @entity127 manager @entity214 watches on in anguish as his side are beaten 2 - 1 by @entity125 @entity217 , so influential for @entity113 in the first leg , fell short in the centre of their midfield with 72 touches			0
his midfielder partner @entity223 had 56			0
@entity78 ( 67 per cent ) , who are moving into a new phase of possession - based football under @entity79 , head the list of teams dominating games , followed by @entity50 ( 64 ) , @entity230 ( 60.9 ) and @entity231 ( 59.6 )			2
those four teams , possibly the most entertaining to watch in the competition this season , are all in the draw for the quarter - final			1
this stuff is staring us in the face and yet we will choose to ignore it because we will be back in thrall with the thrills and spills of the @entity67 this weekend			0
we love its combative nature , the ability to throw up surprises because of its rugged composition , an unpredictable mix of styles , and its raw pace			0
for @entity11 football to succeed in @entity254 , the top teams must evolve , playing a possession - based game and learning to pick their moment in the biggest matches			1
until they do , we all know the score .			0

@entity22 became the latest team to be eliminated from @entity254
city were dumped out of the @entity3 last 16 by @entity50
no @entity11 club made it to the quarter - finals of this season 's competition
@entity21 , @entity20 and @entity19 were all knocked out before the last eight
