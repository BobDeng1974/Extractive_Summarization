@entity1 's hopes of landing their first @entity2 of @entity4 ’s reign have been dashed again as @entity5 deservedly earned a victory that leaves them red - hot favourites to retain their @entity10 title			1
@entity12 ’s men rarely threatened reproduce the form that saw them open the @entity14 with wins over @entity16 and @entity17 as @entity19 ’s second - half try , allied to 14 points from the boot of @entity22 , inflicted a demoralising defeat on the visitors			1
@entity1 travelled across the @entity25 with high hopes of making it three wins from three but were persistently penalised at the breakdown by referee @entity30 as they struggled to gain a foothold in the match			2
video - scroll down to see clips from the game @entity19 ( left ) goes over the line to score a try for @entity5 and take the game away from @entity1 in the @entity10 @entity19 ( left ) had to collect a high ball to go over for the opening try , which was scored in the 52nd minute of the game @entity19 's ( right ) try brought the @entity42 to life as @entity5 beat @entity1 in style in the @entity10 @entity1 's players look dejected after they conceded the opening try of the match against @entity5 and @entity19 @entity19 ( centre ) is congratulated by his @entity5 team - mate @entity49 after scoring the try against @entity1 while not as comprehensive as the 2013 defeat to @entity16 at the @entity52 , or indeed their loss to @entity5 on the same @entity42 turf in 2011 , in some ways this was just as demoralising in a home @entity57 year			1
there were some fine individual performances from @entity1 , with @entity61 outstanding at @entity62 , but collectively the visitors were no match for @entity66 ’s unbeaten @entity65			0
@entity1 , desperate for some silverware three years into @entity4 ’s tenure , must now regroup to face @entity69 and @entity70 at @entity71 but they will do in the knowledge their @entity2 hopes have been shattered again			0
they retain a small chance of winning the @entity14 , but that will prove of little comfort in the light of this comprehensive defeat			0
@entity79 was lashed by wind , rain and sleet in the hours before kick off but mercifully the weather relented to leave the @entity42 pitch slippery but not treacherous			0
@entity1 had made two changes to their starting line - up from the side that beat @entity17 a fortnight ago with @entity88 preferred to @entity89 on the left wing and @entity91 replacing @entity92 after the @entity93 full back failed to recover from concussion he suffered against the @entity17			0
@entity22 was clinical with his kicking and the points he scored provided the backbone for @entity5 's victory @entity100 ( left ) , @entity101 and @entity102 react to @entity1 's defeat against @entity5 @entity104 ( centre ) passes the ball out from the ruck in @entity5 's game against @entity1 on sunday @entity109 ( centre ) of @entity1 is tackled by @entity22 ( second left ) and @entity111 ( right ) of @entity5 @entity112 ( centre ) of @entity1 is hauled down by @entity5 's @entity22 in the clash at the @entity42 @entity5 : @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity49 , @entity19 , @entity117 , @entity22 , @entity104 , @entity118 , @entity111 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124			1
tries : @entity19 penalties : @entity22 ( 4 ) @entity1 : @entity91 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity112 , @entity88 , @entity129 , @entity109 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity101 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136			1
penalties : @entity129 ( 2 ) drop goals : @entity129 referee : @entity30 attendance : 51,500 @entity124 was @entity5 ’s only change as he started at @entity62 in place of @entity143 , who is recovering from the broken vertebra in his back , caused by an intentional knee from @entity70 lock @entity147 which led to a 10 - week ban			2
@entity5 went into the game on the back of a nine - match winning run , including autumn victories over @entity154 and @entity155 , while @entity1 were buoyed by a four - game unbeaten run against today ’s hosts			1
@entity1 were desperate to avoid another slow start after going behind in both their first two games of the @entity14 but , following a lengthy pre-match build up which left the players on the field for several minutes prior to kick off , they were sluggish out of the blocks again			0
@entity165 turned over the ball on the half - way line seconds after kick off and @entity134 infringed at the breakdown after @entity5 whipped the ball wide down the left			0
@entity22 kicked the penalty from 40 metres , with barely two minutes on the clock , before @entity1 conceded another penalty from the kick off and @entity5 roared back into their opponents half			1
with the capacity crowd behind @entity5 , @entity22 hoisted an awkward cross kick which @entity88 was unable to gather and the @entity180 forwards thundered at @entity1 with wave after wave of attacks			1
another penalty was conceded under the posts , which @entity22 converted , as @entity1 found themselves 6 - 0 down having barely drawn breath			2
the visitors finally gained some sustained possession and @entity129 was influential in stretching the @entity180 defence as @entity112 and @entity109 both made telling incursions before the @entity1 fly half slotted a neat drop goal on 12 minutes to get his side on the scoreboard			0
@entity165 missed a long - range penalty attempt and @entity1 blew another excellent chance after fine build - up play saw @entity129 kick a penalty to touch only for @entity131 to throw straight to @entity120 and allow @entity5 to clear			2
@entity91 ( centre ) blasts the ball clear to relieve the pressure on @entity1 from @entity5 in the @entity10 game @entity22 ( right ) of @entity5 tackles @entity129 ( left ) of @entity1 during the @entity10 game at the @entity42 @entity104 ( second right ) clears the ball upfield as @entity134 ( right ) of @entity1 attempts to smother @entity117 ( centre ) is tackled by the @entity1 pair of @entity208 and @entity127 in the @entity10 encounter @entity117 ( centre ) of @entity5 clings to the ball as @entity1 's @entity208 challenges for possession @entity133 ( upper left ) of @entity1 wins the line - out ball under pressure from @entity214 ( right ) of @entity5 @entity165 replied for @entity1 but @entity4 's side could not run @entity5 close in the game at the @entity42 @entity5 flanker @entity217 was taken off after 24 minutes after he was seen lying prone on the floor before attempting to stand up , only to lurch and stagger alarmingly as he battled the medics to stay on			1
the flanker did not return			0
@entity22 kicked his third penalty as @entity5 went 9 - 3 in front with 30 minutes gone but the fly half could not stretch @entity5 ’s lead further when he missed a difficult penalty attempt after @entity127 was penalised for off - side			2
@entity5 took a six - point lead in at half time as @entity1 clung on after 40 minutes that saw that repeatedly penalised by @entity228 referee @entity30			2
@entity5 were fastest out of the blocks in the second half and a sharp break by @entity104 saw @entity19 hack through only for @entity91 to save the day for @entity1 with some brilliant defensive work behind the posts			1
@entity30 again penalised @entity1 at the breakdown on 47 minutes and @entity22 extended his side ’s lead to nine points with his fourth penalty and @entity5 struck the killer blow when @entity104 chiped deep into @entity1 ’s dead - ball area and @entity19 out - jumped @entity91 to touch down			1
@entity19 ( left ) receives treatment during the game against @entity1 but was fit enough to continue and score a try for @entity5 both sides new that victory would give them the upper hand in the race to win the @entity10 @entity1 's players line up for the national anthem prior to the start of their game against @entity5 at the @entity42 @entity22 ’s conversion made it 19 - 3 after 53 minutes and it was impossible to see a way back for @entity1			1
@entity165 added his first penalty to chip away at @entity5 ’s lead after a bulldozing run by @entity61 and gave his side hope after 67 minutes with another three points it proved a false hope as @entity5 held on			0
even @entity88 ’s late try attempt was chalked off when @entity30 spotted a forward pass			0
it summed up @entity1 ’s day .			0

@entity22 led the way for @entity5 with four penalties and @entity19 scored a try
the victory for @entity5 leaves them in the *strongest* position to win the @entity10 with two games remaining
@entity1 hopes of winning the *competition* are now out of their hands
