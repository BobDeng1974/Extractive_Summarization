in what looks to be a horror movie come to life , a terrifying video shows as a hospital patient tears through a hospital attacking nurses with a large metal pole			1
@entity8 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , attacked multiple nurses over the weekend at @entity12 , running through the nurse 's station and hallways of the building as he violently swung a large metal pole at every person he came across			1
in the end , four nurses suffered severe injuries , including a collapsed lung and broken wrist			2
it is not known what caused the attack , though @entity8 , 68 , did suffer from paranoia according to medical workers			1
making the entire incident even more bizarre , police were unable to subdue @entity8 when they located him three blocks away , and , according to @entity50 , three officers were needed to take him down after the probes of their taser failed to attach and take him down			1
then , when they finally managed to get handcuffs on him , he suddenly died			0
scary moments : the man ran through the nurse 's station and hallway hitting everyone he came across victims : four nurses suffered serious injuries as a result of the attack badly hurt : the worst was one woman who suffered a collapsed lung an autopsy has been scheduled			1
' those familiar with mr. @entity8 described a very recent change in which he became confused and periodically delusional , ' said the police department in a release			0
' nothing in mr. @entity8 's past or more recent history indicates a tendency toward violence			2
' one officer on the scene reports that @entity80 , @entity8 's lawyer , said the incident occurred after a family disagreement earlier in the day			1
it is uncertain what exactly happened , but according to @entity86 , ' there was a difference of opinion between @entity8 and his wife and daughter about his treatment â€” so much so that @entity80 sought an emergency order from a @entity94 judge to protect his client			0
' @entity8 told @entity80 at the hospital that he wanted to sell his house and give half of the money to his grandchildren , which he believes indicated that he wanted a separation from his wife			0
the family then caused a scene until @entity80 left the hospital			0
running for their lives : nurses could be seen fleeing from their station into the hallway on the move : @entity8 was eventually found by police three blocks away from the hospital tragic end : @entity8 died shortly after police handcuffed him , this after he was hit with a taser and wrestled to the ground officers were called roughly five hours later , shortly before 2 am when there was a report a man with episodes of confusion had suddenly attacked the nurses at the hospital			1
the actual video footage tracks @entity8 as he goes from nurse 's station to the hallway , hitting anyone he can and not seeming to focus on any specific worker			0
the nurses are caught completely off guard when he first appears , rushing to the door as he lands blow after blow			0
' it is fortunate that hospital personnel were not more seriously injured in the unprovoked attack , ' said @entity142 police chief @entity141			0
' while what prompted the attack may never be known , we await completion of the @entity148 's inquiry , which we hope might answer questions about mr. @entity8 's status for the sake of his family and all those involved in this incident			2

@entity8 , 68 , attacked multiple nurses with a large metal pole at @entity12 in the early morning hours of *sunday*
four nurses were injured in the attack , with one suffering a collapsed lung
it is unknown what caused the attack , though medical workers have said that @entity8 suffered from paranoia
cops captured him three blocks away , wrestling him to the ground after a taser failed to subdue him as the probes did not attach
he *dropped* dead just seconds after he was handcuffed by police
a family disagreement about @entity8 's *future* care on saturday evening involving his wife , daughter and lawyer may have been the cause
