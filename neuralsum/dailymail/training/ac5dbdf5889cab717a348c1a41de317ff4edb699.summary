by @entity0 published : 03:46 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 21:35 est , 18 january 2013 the quest to find scores of buried spitfires in @entity4 was yesterday beginning to descend into farce as doubts grew that any would ever be found			1
@entity7 and disappointment were in danger of splitting the team of experts searching for as many as 136 of the @entity13 fighters			1
the project had finally started after 17 years of effort by a @entity17 devotee trying to find the aircraft last seen boxed up in large crates in 1946			2
excavation : heavy diggers had been brought in to help with the search for the buried spitfires at @entity24 in @entity4 but archaeologists now believe there is no evidence support the claim that the rare aircraft are buried there but divisions among members of the team emerged after they had been searching near the capital @entity35 for two weeks			1
yesterday that dig was suspended and the bizarre treasure hunt will move to a second location 900 miles to the north			2
according to @entity41 , the man leading the hunt , fresh scientific equipment is required before digging can resume at @entity35			1
however , other members of the operation have now cast doubt on the prospect of finding anything at all			0
last night , the internal divisions only added to the confusion over the quixotic attempt to unearth the aircraft			2
they are believed to lie in three locations across @entity4 ( modern - day @entity4 ) and could be worth up to £ 1million each			0
searching : the dig was being led by @entity56 farmer @entity41 ( left ) and has attracted international media attention big dig : @entity60 excavators and tents line the side of the runway at by the side of the runway at the busy airport a 21 - strong team of archaeologists , geo - physicists and sponsors has been at the first site near @entity35 ’s international airport for two weeks and intended to announce their initial findings at a press conference tomorrow			1
however , that was suddenly cancelled on thursday after the team had probed a few feet below the surface and found live cables and functioning technical equipment connected to the airport			0
‘ we had to stop the dig because , while we have equipment to detect spitfires at 20ft , we do n’t have the equipment to detect cables at 5ft , ’ said mr @entity41 , a farmer from @entity56			1
yesterday , the @entity86 reported that some of the archaeologists now doubt the existence of any spitfires			2
since they have yet to visit two other sites identified by mr @entity41 , this has created divisions within the operation			1
‘ the digging went incredibly slowly and i made my opinions known , ’ said mr @entity41			1
technology : mr @entity41 ( left ) looks at ground scans with two of his team of @entity103 archeologists			1
he has spent more than a decade and £ 130,000 working to track down the aircraft hope : the spitfires are believed to have been buried as a way of disposal when the war came to an end blessing : mr @entity41 speaks with a @entity110 monk who was brought to bless the site before digging began site : the @entity4 government has given mr @entity41 's team permission to dig for the planes at @entity35 ( @entity35 ) @entity24 although he is the brains behind the project , the excavation work and archaeologists are being funded by wargaming.net , a video games company , ‘ the archaeologists were n’t digging in the area we believe holds the @entity17 , ’ mr @entity41 added			1
‘ instead , they wanted to see what sort of war remains were buried			0
’ his frustrations were shared by war veteran @entity128 , 86 , a witness to the original burials			0
publicity : a journalist takes photos of research materials related to buried @entity103 spitfires which are thought to be buried in the @entity4 jungle lost : one of the @entity17 ( pictured : the tail fins ) being crated up in @entity4 in 1945 ready to be buried valued : the team hopes to be able to uncover the @entity139 in a good enough state so that they can be reassembled upon their return to @entity103 ( file photo ) last night , having just returned from @entity35 , he said : ‘ they were digging in the wrong place and i told them so			1
’ he has very clear memories of seeing large crates being interred on the site shortly after his 20th birthday in 1946			0
mr @entity128 was stationed in what was then @entity35 while serving in the @entity153			2
‘ i asked this @entity155 chap what was in these huge crates and he said : “ you ’ll never believe it , but they ’re @entity17 ”			0
‘ it was cheaper to bury them than take them home and they did n’t want them falling into the wrong hands			0
’ last night , the sponsors were unavailable for comment			0
meanwhile mr @entity41 made plans to continue digging at the second site at @entity172 where a submerged crate has already been discovered			1
‘ the @entity172 dig looks promising , ’ says spitfire expert @entity174 , who is accompanying mr @entity41			2
‘ they dug a deep hole by hand and at the bottom hit upon the corner of a wooden crate with a metal strap around it			0
‘ the crate was full of muddy water and nothing more was done with it			0
however , it ’s sitting there waiting to be dug up properly			0
’ to add further confusion to the situation , a rival @entity191 excavation team has appeared on the scene in the hope of persuading the @entity4 authorities to allow them to dig for the planes			2
a place in history : a poster unveiling the @entity17 from around 1939			0

archaeologists now say that evidence does not support the claim
no planes have been found at two of the excavation sites
*mechanical* diggers had been brought in to aid search for aircraft in @entity35
excavation work was suspended amid fears it could damage *infrastructure*
spitfires were thought to have been buried in crates during @entity13
@entity221 being led by @entity103 farmer @entity41 who says they are digging in wrong place
