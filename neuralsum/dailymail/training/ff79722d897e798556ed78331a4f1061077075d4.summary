@entity0 says his father had moved from @entity2 to @entity3 to live out his days enjoying the beach , but his retirement came to an abrupt and tragic end during a routine traffic stop last year			1
@entity8 , a retired 61 - year - old autoworker , died in police custody after being arrested outside a @entity10 in @entity3 last @entity11			1
' he was murdered by those officers , ' his son told @entity14			0
@entity8 ' deadly encounter with @entity3 police november 28 was caught on video recorded by a passerby , which shows the man emerging from his car on his own and then surrendering by laying face - down on the beach			1
the footage shows a group of more than a dozen officers surrounding the prostrate man and forming a wall around him			0
in a police report , the 13 officers wrote that @entity0 was pulled over outside the @entity10 on @entity22 for reckless driving , but he fled the scene			1
the documents stated that the 61 - year - old man was charged with resisting an officer with violence			0
but a report filed by paramedics who responded to the scene stated that a police officer told @entity60 workers that @entity17 ran from his car and then collapsed unconscious on the beach			0
evidence : this cell phone video shot by a passerby shows @entity0 emerging from his car ( left ) and then laying face - down on the beach as 13 police officers descend on him with their guns drawn conflicting stories : officers wrote in their reports that the 61 - year - old man violently resisted arrest , but an @entity60 claimed that one of the cops told him @entity17 collapsed unconscious on the beach then again , hospital records obtained by @entity14 indicated that the 61 - year - old retiree ' was found without a pulse by police ' and later passed away from lack of oxygen to the brain			1
but the eyewitness video shot with a cell phone clearly shows @entity8 walking by himself and calmly surrendering to armed police officers			1
the man was taken to @entity85 and placed on life support , but according to @entity17 , he was not notified about his father 's hospitalization until four days later in violation of standing police procedures			0
after the son ordered his father taken off the respirator , he says he was certain that a medical examiner would evaluate his body under a state law requiring an autopsy on anyone who dies in police custody			1
close call : after his son took @entity0 off life support , his body was supposed to be autopsied , but instead it was taken directly to this funeral home and nearly cremated but instead of sending his remains to the medical examiner 's office , police shipped @entity8 directly to a funeral home where the deceased narrowly avoided cremation			1
@entity113 medical examiner @entity112 eventually autopsied @entity0 ' body , concluding in his preliminary report released to @entity116 last month that the 61 - year - old @entity2 transplant suffered 10 broken ribs and bruises on both his wrists from the handcuffs			2
‘ i believe that my father was asphyxiated on the beach in @entity3 by the officers involved that day , ’ said @entity0 ’ son , a former critical care nurse			1
the @entity3 site @entity127 , which has been following the case , reported that @entity17 ' tissue samples have been destroyed			0
in the week after the arrest , some of the 13 officers involved in the case submitted additional reports stating that the 61 - year - old violently struggled to get free			2
@entity0 said his father 's record was far from spotless , with multiple run - ins with the law in the 1990s on charges of domestic abuse and theft , but he can not understand how a simple traffic stop could have resulted in his death			2
checkered past : @entity8 , a 20 - year veteran of @entity2 's automotive industry , had had several run - ins with the law in the 90s on theft and domestic abuse charges both the @entity150 and the @entity152 @entity151 have been investigating the @entity17 case over the past six months			2
‘ we want to be able to provide answers to the @entity0 family			0
we want to provide answers to this community			0
and we want the police officers who are involved to be able to move on from this situation as well			2
’ @entity3 police chief @entity161 told @entity14			0
however , @entity0 ' family and other critics of the law enforcement officials handing the case have pointed to a possible conflict of interest stemming from the fact that lead investigator , @entity169 , is the ex-wife of captain @entity170 , the supervisor of the arresting officers .			0

@entity8 , 61 , was pronounced dead from lack of oxygen to the brain four days after he was arrested november 28 on a @entity3 beach
@entity178 caught @entity0 getting out of his car and lying face - down as he surrendered to police , but officers wrote the retiree violently resisted arrest
@entity0 ' body was nearly cremated before autopsy in violation of state law
