@entity0 conjured an impressive qualifying lap to claim his first pole position for eight races ahead of the @entity5 @entity4			1
since last starting from top spot on the grid in @entity11 in may , @entity7 team - mate @entity6 has claimed six poles in seven grands prix , whilst @entity0 has endured a catalogue of woes			1
but in a straight fight around a power circuit such as @entity19 , it was @entity0 who blew everybody out of the water - finishing more than a quarter of a second faster than @entity6 as @entity7 clinched their seventh front - row lock - out of the campaign			1
now , click here to read the full report ... host commentator thanks for your company today and be sure to join us for tomorrow 's race in @entity19			1
until then , good afternoon			0
@entity33 ; 2 @entity6 ; 3 @entity34 ; 4 @entity35 ; 5 @entity36 ; 6 @entity37 ; 7 @entity38 ; 8 @entity39 ; 9 @entity40 ; 10 @entity41 @entity6 is two tenths adrift of @entity0 after his final run despite going faster in the final sector			1
that means @entity0 will start from pole for tomorrow 's race			1
what a stellar opening lap that was from @entity50			0
turn one should be a tasty affair tomorrow			0
so , after the first runs , @entity0 is ahead of @entity6 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity37 , @entity39 , @entity38 , @entity36 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
we 've got three minutes remaining			0
and @entity0 goes fastest by @entity54 ; surely that will be a time which will prove hard to beat ? the @entity58 driver is looking very handy here			1
@entity6 is quicker than @entity0 in the first sector , but @entity0 has the upper hand elsewhere			1
1:24.552 from @entity6 and that 's fast enough for provisional pole ... but @entity0 is flying - some three tenths up on his team - mate in the middle sector			1
@entity41 is the first driver to lay down a marker : he posts a 1:26.230			0
here we got then ... the battle for the top 10 commences			0
@entity6 is bidding for his fifth straight pole ; something which has n't been done since @entity39 in 2011			1
so , who do you fancy to be on pole ? @entity0 or @entity6 ? @entity0 or @entity6 ? @entity0 ends the session quickest with @entity6 just 0.040secsbehind his team - mate			1
but in front of the tifosi , @entity77 crashes out of qualifying			2
the @entity81 made errors on both of his timed laps , and he could manage only 12th			0
@entity77 locks up heading into turn one , and then runs wide at the chicane , so he eases off the gas to save the tyres and prepare for one final shot			0
he 's on the bubble in 10th so you 'll fancy he needs to improve on his time			2
there are three minutes to run and @entity36 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 face elimination from @entity99 if they ca n't improve on their times			0
the @entity102 emerges from the @entity104 garage and he pops in the fastest time of the weekend			0
he is then urged to get a move on so he can go for a second run			0
and @entity6 storms to the top of the timesheets			1
he is over 1.5seconds quicker than @entity94			0
here comes @entity34 ... what can the @entity112 driver do ? he goes second , two tenths off @entity6 's time			1
ten minutes left to run and only two timed laps : @entity94 leads the way ... but @entity6 is on a flyer ... the @entity120 posts a 1:31.488 which is a long way short of where he wants to be			1
he 'll run again ... @entity96 , in his @entity124 , is the first driver to take to the @entity19 circuit			1
skies are blue , the sun is out and the track is clear			0
@entity0 will be pleased to be back at the top of the timesheets , but the @entity102 must make it count in @entity99			2
an impressive display from both @entity112 men			0
they have to be considered as serious challengers to @entity7 here			0
both @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 drivers are out of the session and that 's the first time both @entity142 and @entity143 have failed to progress to @entity99 since the season opener in @entity145			2
the @entity137 pair look to be in trouble here			0
both @entity142 and @entity143 occupy the bottom six with less than a minute of @entity99 to go			0
after a scruffy lap , @entity0 responds to leapfrog @entity35 and @entity6 and return to the top of the timesheets , one tenth or so faster than his @entity7 team - mate			1
@entity153 , @entity98 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 are heading for the exit while the @entity137 of @entity143 is yet to set a time ... but just as i write that , the @entity159 leaves the pits			0
' that was a pretty shocking lap ' , says @entity0 as he fails to improve his time			2
@entity6 on the other hand does go quicker , and he bumps @entity35 down to second			1
but the championship leader is only 0.035sec quicker than the @entity112 man			0
and @entity35 does lay down a marker in @entity19 as he posts a 1:25.528 to head the timesheets with eight minutes of @entity169 remaining			1
@entity112 have looked handy all weekend , and @entity35 splits the @entity7 duo as he pops into second			2
he is less than a tenth off @entity0 's best time			1
could the @entity175 - based outfit spring a surprise today ? @entity38 gives the tifosi something to cheer about as he heads to the top of the lap charts , but he is soon eclipsed by @entity6 who is more than six tenths quicker than the @entity182 ... but here comes @entity0 ... and , boom , the @entity102 is faster than the pair of them			1
and we 're up and running in @entity19			2
@entity6 , who was battling a gearbox issue , is among the first drivers to take to the track			2
@entity191 work from the @entity7 team there			2
@entity0 is out on the circuit , too			2
@entity0 embraces his dad @entity194 before stepping in the car			2
a pivotal qualifying session for the @entity102 today - he has n't been on pole for 118 days			2
there is more than a little suggestion that this could be @entity201 's final grand prix as @entity203 president			2
indeed , there is talk the iconic @entity206 figure could be gone by the middle of next week			0
the 67 - year - old is in the paddock this weekend and he popped into the @entity203 garage to give @entity38 a hug ... and it looked as though he enjoyed it			0
if an when there is something to say about if i am staying i will make an announcement			0
' following the drama with @entity0 and @entity6 , @entity40 ’s second straight win – following his @entity221 triumph – was somewhat lost			1
' he has been remarkable , ’ says his boss @entity222			0
‘ we have been there to capitalise on the misfortunes at @entity7 , but you still have to be there and deliver and @entity228 has been fantastic at that			0
’ @entity40 is 64 points behind @entity6 leading to some suggestions he might yet capture either of the @entity7 ’ men			1
‘ we are a long way behind but we are just going to go for it , ’ said @entity222			0
‘ the more pressure we can put on @entity7 more mistakes tend to happen so the objective is flat - out with both of them			0
’ the @entity5 @entity4 has been won from pole 11 times in the last 14 years , making it more important than @entity241 , which has only been won from pole nine times in the same period			1
after what happened at the @entity246 @entity4 , i took a lot of time to reflect on the events of the weekend			1
i have since apologised to everybody that i can ; starting with the fans because they wanted to see a battle with @entity0 and that did not happen			2
i have apologised to my team , and to everybody involved with the team			0
i have also apologised to @entity0 ... the @entity102 , whose deal with @entity7 expires as the end of next season , has held tentative talks with the team he left in 2012			1
you can ready more on that story here ... @entity6 encountered a gearbox problem in final practice this morning meaning he missed the entirety of the session			2
@entity0 meanwhile , was quickest			2
' we had an electronic problem on the gearbox which normally we can solve , ’ said @entity7 boss @entity272			0
‘ the guys are working hard and hopefully we can get it ready in time			0
not running light fuel before qualifying is n’t perfect but he is very experienced			0
he was in the debrief , and he knows how the car will behave … he will manage			0
’ a fortnight on from their collision in @entity282 , @entity0 and @entity6 will resume their title back in qualifying for tomorrow 's @entity5 @entity4			1
@entity6 has accepted fault for the crash on lap two of the @entity246 @entity4 , and he was subsequently punished by @entity7 with a six - figure fine			1
he has apologised to the team , @entity0 and the fans - who booed him on the podium , too			1
for @entity0 , he has been cast 29 points adrift of @entity6 , and you get the feeling he must outscore his team - mate in @entity19 if he wants to win this championship			1

@entity0 records his first pole position since may 's @entity11 @entity4
his rival @entity6 will start **alongside** him on the front row at @entity19
@entity34 will start in *3rd* with team - mate @entity35 **alongside** him
@entity0 is 29 points adrift of @entity6 following @entity246 *gp* smash
