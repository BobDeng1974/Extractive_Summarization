a team of medical researchers are on their way to finding a cure for cancer after the discovery of a an amazing rainforest berry which holds cancer fighting properties			1
scientists at @entity9 in @entity10 have used an experimental drug produced from the seeds of the rainforest plant , @entity15 tree ( @entity16 ) , which exclusively grows in far north @entity10 , to cure solid cancer tumours in pre-clinical trials			1
already the drug has been used to successfully destroy or shrink tumours in pets and animals â€“ including dogs , cats and horses and even @entity26 , while human trials are imminent			1
@entity28 ( pictured ) is the plant where the cancer fighting berries are sourced			1
scientists from an experimental drug produced by the seeds of the plant have been used to cure cancer tumors in pre clinical trials the study led by dr @entity38 ( pictured ) found a single injection of the drug @entity41 led to rapid breakdown of a range of tumors which could be effective in human patients the study led by dr @entity38 found a single injection of the drug @entity41 led to rapid breakdown of a range of tumors which could be effective in human patients			1
' we were able to achieve very strong results injecting @entity41 directly into melanoma models , as well as cancers of the head , neck and colon , ' said dr @entity38			2
' in most cases the single injection treatment caused the loss of viability of cancer cells within four hours , and ultimately destroyed the tumours			2
' dr @entity38 says @entity41 works in part by triggering a cellular response which effectively cuts off the blood supply to the tumour			2
' in more than 70 per cent of pre-clinical cases , the response and cure was long - term and enduring , with very little relapse over a period of 12 months			0
' dr. @entity38 also told @entity74 about the use of several models of tumours			0
' including melanoma , head and neck cancer , colon , prostate cancer , and breast cancer , and it works very well in all of them			0
we 're looking at around about a 75 per cent ablation rate , ' he said			0
the @entity9 building ( pictured ) @entity9 where the research has been done to find the cancer fighting berry from the @entity15 rainforest plant he says the drug can start working instantly			1
' there 's a purpling of the area of the tumour itself , and you see that within five minutes			0
you come back the next day and the tumour is black , and come back a few days later and the tumour has fallen off			0
' dr. @entity38 has also described how the compound works in three ways , killing the tumor , cutting off blood supply and activating the body 's immune system to clean up			0
@entity41 ( pictured ) is the compound extracted from the berry of the @entity15 tree which is found in @entity10 @entity41 - 46 is a compound extracted from the fruit of the @entity15 tree which is found in north @entity10 rainforests and has been known to have fast acting medicinal properties			1
finding the wonder - berry can be difficult because the @entity28 is extremely particular about which conditions it will grow			0
but it was discovered by the @entity10 biotechnology company @entity115 and is being developed as a human and veterinarian pharmaceutical through @entity118			1
@entity119 is currently undertaking formal veterinary clinical trials in @entity121 and the @entity122 while a final regulatory approval is still required for a human phase and clinical trial			1
' the human trials planning is a work in progress , ' said a @entity119 spokesman			1
' they have not yet started trials			0
' dr. @entity38 says he is keen to pursue further research to see if this drug could be made more effective			0
' we must stress at this point that @entity41 will only be trialled in the short - term for tumours which can be accessed by direct injection or topical application , ' dr @entity38 said			2
' there is no evidence to suggest @entity41 would be effective against metastatic cancers			2
