by @entity1 reporter published : 14:19 est , 10 february 2014 @entity3 : 15:50 est , 10 february 2014 health officials have begun to predict the end of cigarette smoking in @entity7			1
they have long wished for a cigarette - free @entity7 , but shied away from calling for smoking rates to fall to zero or near zero by any particular year			1
the power of tobacco companies and popularity of their products made such a goal seem like a pipe dream			0
but a confluence of changes has recently prompted public health leaders to start throwing around phrases like ' endgame ' and ' tobacco - free generation			1
' now , they talk about the slowly - declining adult smoking rate dropping to 10 percent in the next decade and to 5 percent or lower by 2050			1
the end is coming : officials say @entity7 may fully kick the habit within the next few decades acting u.s. surgeon general @entity27 last month released a 980 - page report on smoking that pushed for stepped - up tobacco - control measures			1
his news conference was an unusually animated showing of anti-smoking bravado , with @entity27 nearly yelling , repeatedly , ' @entity31 is enough ! ' ' i ca n't accept that we 're just allowing these numbers to trickle down , ' he said , in a recent interview with the @entity1 ' we believe we have the public health tools to get us to the zero level			0
' this is not the first time a federal health official has spoken so boldly			0
in 1984 , surgeon general @entity44 called for a " smoke - free society " by the year 2000			0
however , @entity44 - a bold talker on many issues - did n't offer specifics on how to achieve such a goal			0
' what 's different today is that we have policies and programs that have been proven to drive down tobacco use , ' said @entity55 , president of the @entity56			0
' we could n't say that in 1984			0
' among the things that have changed : - cigarette taxes have increased around the country , making smokes more expensive			1
though prices vary from state to state , on average a pack of cigarettes that would have sold for about $ 1.75 20 years ago would cost more than triple that now			1
- laws banning smoking in restaurants , bars and workplaces have popped up all over the country			1
airline flights have long been off - limits for smoking			1
- polls show that cigarette smoking is no longer considered normal behavior , and is now less popular among teens than marijuana			1
halting all sales : @entity82 / @entity82 has announced it will no longer sell cigarettes as of october 1 - federal officials are increasingly aggressive about anti-smoking advertising			1
the @entity86 launched a new youth tobacco prevention campaign last week			0
at about the same time , the @entity88 debuted a third , $ 60 - million round of its successful anti-tobacco ad campaign - this one featuring poignant , deathbed images of a woman featured in earlier ads. - tobacco companies , once considered impervious to legal attack , have suffered some huge defeats in court			2
perhaps the biggest was the 1998 settlement of a case brought by more than 40 states demanding compensation for the costs of treating smoking - related illnesses			2
@entity105 agreed to pay about $ 200 billion and curtail marketing of cigarettes to youths			2
- retailing of cigarettes is changing , too			2
@entity82 , the nation 's second - largest pharmacy chain , announced last week it will stop selling tobacco products at its more than 7,600 drugstores			1
the company said it made the decision in a bid to focus more on providing health care , but medical and public health leaders predicted pressure will increase on companies like @entity121 and @entity122 to follow suit			0
' i do think , in another few years , that pharmacies selling cigarettes will look as anachronistic ' as old cigarette ads featuring physician endorsements look today , said @entity88 director dr. @entity129			1
mounting pressure : experts believe pressure will eventually force retailers @entity122 and @entity121 's to follow @entity82 / @entity82 's lead these developments have made many in public health dream bigger			1
it 's caused @entity55 ' organization and others to recently tout the goal of bringing the adult smoking rate down to 10 percent by 2024 , from the current 18 percent			1
that would mean dropping it at twice the speed it declined over the last 10 years			0
the bigger goal is to reduce @entity7 smoking - related deaths to fewer than 10,000 , from the current level of 480,000			1
but even if smoking rates dropped to zero immediately , it would take decades to see that benefit , since smoking - triggered cancers can take decades to develop			2
but while some experts and advocates are swinging for the fences , others are more pessimistic			0
they say the key to reaching such goals is not simply more taxes and more local smoking bans , but action by the @entity86 to regulate smoking			2
a 2009 federal law gave the @entity86 the authority to regulate tobacco products			0
the law barred @entity86 from outright blocking the sale of cigarettes , but the agency was free to take such pivotal steps as prohibiting the use of appealing menthol flavoring in cigarettes and requiring cigarette makers to ratchet down the amount of addictive nicotine in each smoke			1
becoming obsolete : displays like this will be less common as more and more retailers stop selling smokes but nearly five years after gaining power over cigarettes , @entity86 has yet to even propose such regulations			1
agency officials say they 're working on it			2
many believe @entity86 's delay is driven by defense preparations for an anticipated battery of legal and political challenges			0
a spokesman for @entity192 , the maker of @entity193 , said the company supports @entity86 exercising its regulatory authority over tobacco products			0
but as a whole , the industry has tended to fight regulation			0
some of the nation 's largest tobacco companies - though not @entity192 - sued to stop @entity86 - proposed graphic warning labels on cigarette packs			1
a federal court blocked the ads. ' the industry makes money as long as they can delay regulation , ' said @entity209 , a @entity211 public health professor who is a leading authority on smoking and health			2
@entity209 and @entity211 colleague @entity215 estimate that , barring any major new tobacco control victories , the adult smoking rate will drop from its current 18 percent only to about 12 percent by 2050			1
if health officials do make huge strides , the rate could drop as low as 6 percent , they think			1
will that ever happen ? more accepted : more teens now smoke marijuana than cigarettes some experts doubt it			1
as long as cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products are legal , it 's likely some people will smoke them			2
efforts to prohibit them are likely to fail , they say			0
( remember @entity233 ? ) ' it 's hard to do a ban on cigarettes because you 're taking something away from people they have and are using			2
once you have something , you hold tight , ' said @entity241 , a @entity242 law professor who focuses on tobacco issues			0
better , he said , to bar people from having a product in the first place			0
he is intrigued by legal efforts in @entity248 and a handful of other countries to ban sales of tobacco to anyone born after a certain year - 2000 , say			0
that would be constitutional , he said			0
the question is : would our culture accept it ? probably not , said @entity259 , editor - in - chief of the scientific journal @entity261			0
' in our culture , we tend to think we have a right to things even if they 're terrible for us , ' she said			0
a growing number of experts believe the most promising option is to get people to switch voluntarily to something else , like electronic cigarettes			2
on the fringe : smokers have already been pushed outdoors for their fix - soon they will be pushed out altogether , if predictions hold true electronic cigarettes are battery - powered devices that provide users with aerosol puffs that typically contain nicotine , and sometimes flavorings like fruit , mint or chocolate			2
they 've often been described as a less dangerous alternative to regular cigarettes			2
but there are few studies exploring exactly what chemicals are in them , and in what concentrations , and whether those levels are harmful			0
they 're controversial : some experts believe that at a time when cigarette smoking has finally become passe in popular culture , e-cigarettes may re-glamorize puffing away in public places			1
' it could go in either direction , ' said @entity304 , the @entity305 's chief executive officer			0
but if the @entity86 can ratchet down nicotine in conventional cigarettes to levels below what 's in e-cigarettes , perhaps everyone who clings to smoking will switch to the higher - nicotine new products			1
that could achieve the end of smoking , at least of combustible , carcinogen - filled cigarettes - or so the thinking goes			1
in the past , ' the country really was n't ready ' to walk away from cigarettes , ' @entity241 said			0
' i think the country 's ready now			0

cigarette smoking is no longer considered normal behavior and is less popular among teens than marijuana
officials believe the percentage of @entity7 smoking will drop to single *digits* by 2050
@entity82 / @entity82 recently announced it will stop selling cigarettes *nationwide* by october
