by @entity0 @entity2 roundabouts are among the most dangerous in the western world because they are designed for capacity and not safety , a new study has shown			1
the report , which was released by @entity8 last week , found that the design of @entity2 roundabouts encouraged drivers to speed through intersections and to ‘ look but not see ’ other motorists			1
@entity2 roundabouts are built according to a tangential design , which means that the driver has very good visibility as they approach the roundabout and is less likely to slow down , or check the roundabout closely as they approach the intersection			2
the @entity19 in @entity22 ( pictured ) is one of the nation 's most dangerous , between 2009 and 2013 there were 291 crashes at the roundabout the researchers suggested that the ideal speed at which motorists should travel through a roundabout is 25 km / hr , but with the current @entity2 tangential design , many motorists do not slow down as they approach the roundabout and regularly go through at speeds in excess of 40 km / hr. @entity2 roundabouts differ from those built in the @entity38 and @entity39 , which employ a ‘ radial ’ design that deliberately aims to reduce visibility			1
these roundabouts are designed to force drivers to reduce their speed as they approach the roundabout , giving them enough time to scan for other motorists and cyclists before entering the roundabout			2
cyclists were particularly at risk on @entity2 roundabouts			1
in @entity55 , one in 10 accidents involving a bike occurs at a roundabout , reported the study			1
this figure gets worse in cities , with almost half of all roundabout crashes in inner city @entity62 between 2004 and 2009 involving cyclists			0
almost half of all accidents at roundabouts in inner - city @entity62 ( pictured ) involve cyclists @entity39 roundabouts employ a radial design ( left ) rather than the tangential design ( right ) used on @entity2 roundabouts			1
the tangential design allows for too much visibility and encourages drivers to speed through the roundabout in @entity77 , 15 percent of all bicycle crashes at intersections occurred at roundabouts , despite roundabouts accounting for only four percent of intersections			0
one of @entity2 's worst roundabouts was the @entity19 in @entity22			0
between 2009 and 2013 there were 291 crashes at that roundabout , though the average has dropped since september 2013 when the roundabout was upgraded			0
the research also found that attempts to improve the safety of cyclists might actually be making conditions more dangerous for them			0
bicycle lanes , for instance , may make a roundabout feel bike - friendly , but actually increase the risk of crashes by positioning bicyclists away from the middle of lanes where motorists look			2
bike lanes also make cyclists more vulnerable to sideswipe accidents and those caused when drivers of parked cars open their car doors in front of cyclists without looking .			0

@entity2 roundabouts are more dangerous than those in the rest of the @entity115 - *speaking* world
they are designed for speed , rather than safety
cyclists are particularly at risk , in @entity55 one in 10 accidents involving a bike occurs at a roundabout
