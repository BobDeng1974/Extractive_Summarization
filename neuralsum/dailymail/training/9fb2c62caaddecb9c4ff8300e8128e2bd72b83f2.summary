the 42 - year - old is so worried , he is investing in @entity8 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand			1
for a man regarded as one of the world ’s leading innovators , his comments provide a sobering warning of the dangers that @entity8 could pose to humanity			1

the 42 - year - old is so worried that he is investing in @entity8 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand in march , @entity1 made an investment @entity35 - based @entity8 group @entity33 , along with @entity36 and actor @entity37			1
@entity33 ’ ultimate aim is to build a ‘ computer that thinks like a person … except it does n’t have to eat or sleep ’ , according to the company 's co-founder @entity43			2
in an interview with @entity46 on tuesday , @entity1 said : ‘ i think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there			2
’ ‘ there have been movies about this , you know , like @entity54 , ’ @entity1 continued			2
‘ there are some scary outcomes			0
and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good , not bad			0

one of its founders warned artificial intelligence is ' number 1 risk for this century , ' and believes it could play a part in human extinction ' eventually , i think human extinction will probably occur , and technology will likely play a part in this , ' @entity89 ’s @entity88 said in a recent interview			1

neuroscientist @entity103 , 37 , founded @entity89 two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans			2
@entity33 is currently attempting to build a program that mimics the brain ’s neocortex			1
the neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals			0
it is around 3mm thick and has six layers , each involved with various functions			0
these include sensory perception , spatial reasoning , conscious thought , and language in humans			0
according to the company ’s website : ‘ @entity33 is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain			1
‘ our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans			0
‘ powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the @entity140			0
’ in october 2013 , the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ‘ reliably ’ solves modern @entity143 - the world ’s most widely used test of a machine ’s ability to act human			2

professor @entity165 said dismissing the film as science fiction could be the ‘ worst mistake in history ’			1
@entity165 has warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to be the downfall of mankind			1
' success in creating @entity8 would be the biggest event in human history , ' he said writing in the @entity173			2
