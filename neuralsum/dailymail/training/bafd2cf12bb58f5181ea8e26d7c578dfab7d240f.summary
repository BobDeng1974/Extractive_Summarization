by @entity0 on my bedside table i have a picture of me lying on the sofa hugging @entity5			2
it ’s a bit blurry because it was taken with an old - fashioned @entity10 camera , but it is precious because it ’s the last picture of me together with my beloved old ginger tom			1
when it was taken , i knew @entity5 ’s days were numbered , but even then we were n’t quite ready to let go of each other			2
as anyone who has welcomed a cat into their home as part of the family will recognise , however sick they get , however skinny and matted , you know when there ’s life in the old furball yet — and when it ’s time to let them go			1
old favourites : @entity0 's treasured @entity10 picture of her old ginger @entity5 who has since died no vet , no friend even , can make that decision for you			2
it ’s a heartbreaking pact you and your pet enter into together , when the time is right			2
that ’s why i was so appalled — and enraged — to read how the @entity44 had stepped in and ordered the destruction of a bedraggled but beloved elderly cat named @entity47 , against his family ’s wishes			1
a neighbour had reported that @entity47 looked unkempt , yet his owners insist he was perfectly healthy — just a skinny , matted mess of old fur			1
he was a long - haired @entity55 who hated being groomed so much that his family took him to the vet every year to be anaesthetised so he could be brushed properly			2
hardly the act of uncaring or neglectful owners			2
eventually , the vet refused to continue this practice on the grounds it was n’t good for @entity47 to have any more anaesthetics , so his devoted owner @entity65 cut his fur with nail clippers while he slept — hence the bedraggled look that alarmed the oh - so zealous neighbour			1
when the @entity44 arrived , they seized the family cat , insisted that he was put down , then issued legal proceedings against @entity65 and her husband @entity73 — an accountant from @entity75 in @entity76 — for cruelty			1
the family also claim that the charity even refused a stay of execution for four hours to give their two children , @entity83 and @entity84 , the chance to say goodbye to @entity47 — though an @entity44 spokesman disputes that			1
now , thankfully , the @entity88 has ruled that the prosecution must be dropped , which is a small mercy given what the family have been through			2
they had the good sense to tape their conversations with the @entity44 inspector — and the officer can be heard threatening them with calling in the police if they do n’t agree to have @entity47 killed			1
unsurprisingly , mrs @entity65 can be heard bursting into tears several times			2
the charity says it had been concerned for @entity47 ’s welfare — but is it any wonder that it ’s haemorrhaging donations ? they fell by £ 7 million last year , and membership is down by six per cent			1
many fear the @entity44 has become obsessed with pursuing politically motivated causes , like the prosecution of the prime minister ’s rural hunt			1
last year it prosecuted an owner for not taking a sick cat to the vet , and threatened a woman with prison after she treated her dog ’s fleas with a canine shampoo that could have given it an allergy			1
and a report reveals that 3,400 animals were put down by the charity in 2011 for ‘ non- medical reasons ’ — 44 per cent of all those taken in			2
@entity47 the cat , who was put down against his family 's wishes after they were reported to the @entity44 yes , the @entity44 does fine work , and the vast majority of its actions lead to convictions			1
but it seems as though an arrogance has seeped into this organisation that means it sometimes plays @entity137 with our beloved pets			1
it now feels it can step in and destroy any animal it chooses — even one like @entity47 , who , as tests proved after he was put down , was as healthy as any elderly cat could be			1
reading his story made my blood run cold , then boil , and brought the memories flooding back of my beloved @entity5 ’s last months			1
because he proved that a cat and its owner are the best possible judges of when the time to go is right			1
his arrival in my life in 2003 was somewhat unusual			2
i had just lost my beloved cat @entity157 , brother of the then recently departed @entity159 , and had written about the terrible loss in the @entity161			1
no cat , i thought , could replace my constant companions of almost two decades			1
but that was before i found this adorable six - year - old ginger moggie , who looked after me for 11 years			2
despite his grumpy appearance ( he had an adorable overhanging forehead ) , he was the sweetest , most gentle cat i ’ve ever known			1
i nicknamed him ‘ slipper ’ because wherever i was , he came plodding along — purring so loudly it was like an ever - present buzz - saw			2
he grew fat and happy , and having been very timid , did eventually venture outside , safe in the knowledge that nothing would ever separate us except death			2
as a kitten , he had been in and out of cat homes			1
it was only towards the end , when he could n’t make it up the stairs to my bedroom , that he did n’t sleep curled behind my knees each night			2
by then he had a lot of health problems — he was on daily pills for his failing kidneys and an overactive thyroid			0
like @entity47 , he had crazy fur , too — standing on end as though he ’d gelled it up — because he was n’t able to clean himself properly			1
but luckily he had only one tooth left by then , so he could n’t bite me as i gently helped him swallow his medication , followed by lashings of beef and turkey @entity197			0
but his favourite treat was @entity202 prawns , cut into tiny pieces so he could ‘ gum ’ them properly			0
due to his overactive thyroid , it did n’t matter how much he ate , he just got skinnier and skinnier — his weight dropped from 18lb at his peak to just 4lb			0
it sounds as though @entity47 was in a similar situation — bony , matted and scraggy			1
but even if a cat looks like that , it does n’t mean they are n’t happy			1
all i had to do was open a pack of prawns , and @entity5 was there like lightning			0
at least until one day about a year ago			0
he was asleep on the sofa at the other end of the sitting room when i brought in some prawns , and he did n’t move			0
he also cried out when i picked him up			0
determined that he receive the best care , i called out the vet , who examined him and announced : ‘ it ’s time			0
’ he said he could put @entity5 to sleep then and there , but i knew in my heart he was n’t ready for that — and nor was i. so we decided to see how he fared over the weekend			0
well , @entity5 must have heard us because he rallied and was down off that sofa like a kitten the next day for his prawn treat — although using the cushion steps i ’d built up for him because he had trouble jumping up and down			0
that call to the vet the following monday was one of the happiest of my life			0
‘ nope , it ’s not time , ’ i said			0
‘ but what about the quality of his life ? ’ the vet asked			0
@entity5 , i reported , was happy , not in pain and purring			0
no @entity252 cat pathway for him yet , thanks , i said			1
like the @entity255 family , who knew @entity47 was getting towards the end but was n’t ready to die , i wanted @entity5 to have one last summer			1
that ’s exactly what he got — and another autumn and winter , too			0
i had the vet check on him regularly , and the diagnosis was simply that he was old			0
yet even then , nothing dimmed those beautiful green eyes nor silenced that purr			0
then , just before @entity264 this year , @entity5 had a minor stroke and raced around the room , clearly in distress and howling			0
in the days that followed , the life visibly ebbed out of him			0
then one morning , when i went down to cuddle him and prepare his breakfast , he did n’t want to get off the sofa			0
he looked at me as it to say : ‘ i ’m ready ’ — and i knew he was			0
that ’s the magical thing about cats			0
it happened with both @entity277 and @entity157 : they knew their time had come before i did			0
so i called the vet and held @entity5 in my arms in his last moments			0
he opened those great big eyes and blinked slowly at me , and his limp body just melted into mine			0
and then he was gone			0
that ’s the ending @entity47 should have had — surrounded by the family who loved him , not put down in some strange place at the behest of an official who had threatened his owners with police action .			1
