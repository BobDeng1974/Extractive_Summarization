when @entity1 saw the first flickering video images of a wall of oozing , stinking grease , he knew that his day had taken a turn for the worse			1
this was n’t just a normal sewer blockage			2
this was the mother of all blockages — a putrid , steaming mountain of congealed lard and worse , the size of a double - decker bus and weighing a staggering 15 tons			1
disgusting is n’t the word			2
@entity17 claimed @entity18 had nine circles , while @entity20 insisted that @entity18 was other people			2
but clearly neither had ever been in close proximity to a ‘ fatberg ’			2
it was described as the size of a double decker bus they look revolting , they smell revolting , they harbour disease and they are almost impossible to shift			1
and if one forms in the sewer near your home , then heaven help you			2
unless it is quickly removed , your drains and lavatories will soon be overflowing with filth			2
what ’s most shocking is that the number of fatbergs is on the rise , and our careless attitude to what we flush down the drains and sewers — and our love affairs with fattening takeaway food and cooking oil — are responsible			2
‘ we get immune to most things , but when you come across a lump of decomposing fat , the smell is horrid , ’ says @entity1 , who has cleared sewers for @entity62 for 18 years			1
‘ the fatbergs are usually lard - coloured , with flecks of brown and black , depending on what is in them			1
‘ if you touch it , or if it gets on your skin , then the smell stays with you for five to seven days , no matter how many times you wash or shower			0
‘ it ’s like old rotten compost , or musty dog combined with the smell of sewers			0
’ among the biggest problems are wet - wipes and other products that are flushed away but do n’t break down in the sewer , says @entity1			1
if they snag , then the fat starts to congeal on them and it builds up			1
‘ people flush fat down the sink and think that because they pour a kettle of hot water after it that it ’s gone , ’ he says			1
‘ but of course they just move the problem on			0
no amount of detergent stops it congealing in the sewer			0
’ the accumulation of fat in our crumbling , @entity105 sewers is nothing new — although the amount of oil we are consuming in our diets is			1
sixteen years ago i wrote for the @entity111 about the sludge choking up the drains and sewers of @entity32 — mostly from restaurants and takeaways that failed to fit fat - traps to siphon off the waste			1
back in 1997 , @entity62 reckoned it had to scrape away 37 cubic feet of congealed fat from sewers in the heart of the capital , using hand - picks and pressure hoses			1
but that was from a two - mile area			1
what is astonishing about this latest fatberg is the sheer volume in one giant lump under a single street in an outer @entity32 suburb			1
to put it into perspective , in the @entity134 , @entity62 spent £ 2 million scraping fat from its network			1
last year it spent £ 12 million			0
such costs are inevitably passed on to customers via their bills			0
but nothing has ever rivalled the record - breaking fatberg discovered by @entity1 ’s team in @entity31 upon @entity143			1
that plug of grease was so big it nearly blocked the 2.4m - wide brick sewer and caused toilets to stop flushing in a nearby block of flats			1
left for a few days longer , the sewer would have clogged up completely , forcing raw sewage out of manholes and up through toilets into bathrooms — spreading the kind of filth and disease normally associated with the poorest shanty towns in the world			1
‘ i ’ve never seen anything like it , ’ says @entity1 , whose team worked every night for three weeks to clear it , using shovels and a high - pressure hose			1
‘ we know exactly how much it weighed because we scraped out the fat and took it away to be measured			1
normally you would pull out one or two tons			0
but this weighed 15 tons			0
’ rivers of filth : if workers had n't cleared the mass , raw sewage could have spurted out of manholes across the whole of @entity31 in suburban areas , households are as much to blame as restaurants and takeaway outlets for pouring cooking oil down sinks			1
when the oil hits the cold water in sewers , it congeals			0
fat and oil should be bottled and disposed of in bins , water companies say			1
yet @entity192 alone pour away around 33 - 44 million litres of cooking oil each year			1
the careless disposal of fat is only part of the story of how a fatberg forms			1
we are also becoming more fastidious about our bodies — using wet - wipes as never before			1
once they were used only on babies — now they can be found in bathrooms nationwide			1
as with many things , celebrities have helped fuel the trend			0
sales of wet - wipes are rising by around 15 per cent a year , with many sold on the promise they are ‘ flush - able ’			2
that ’s a word the water companies dispute			0
those ‘ flushable wipes ’ cause 75 per cent of all sewer blockages , according to @entity62			0
the company says it clears nearly 40,000 blockages every year in its 59,000 miles of sewers and pipes			0
it is a similar story for water firms in other parts of the @entity223			0
@entity224 , a @entity62 spokesman , says : ‘ we are seeing an increasing trend across @entity223 of people using wet - wipes instead of loo roll			2
‘ our sewers are designed to take human waste and loo roll , and nothing else			2
when a wipe goes down , it does n’t break down			0
manufacturers say they do eventually , but that ’s in a landfill site			0
in contrast , loo roll breaks down in seconds			0
‘ no moistened wipe has yet to come on the market that is acceptable to sewers			0
’ when wipes are flushed away , they catch on joints or corners of sewers , particularly in older @entity105 tunnels that run under our major towns and cities			0
fat congeals on the wipes , which attracts more wipes — and more fat			2
the bergs build up like foul stalactites from the roofs of sewers			0
about the latest fatberg , mr @entity224 says : ‘ we ’ve removed greater volumes of fat from under the sewers in @entity32 but we ’ve never come across a congealed single lump of lard of this size			1
‘ it was clinging to the roof and the floor , and was the whole breadth of the sewer			0
’ the solution , according to water companies , is for people to look to the continent			0
if they want to use wipes , they should do what the @entity280 do			0
much of the plumbing in @entity280 is unable to cope with toilet paper , so visitors to the loo must place paper in a bin			0
what works for toilet paper , works for wipes			0
the longer - term solution , though , is surely to start investing in bidets			2
what could be cleaner , cheaper and less harmful to the environment than a dose of old - fashioned water and soap ? wipes , meanwhile , are best left for changing nappies			2
otherwise , @entity1 and his colleagues at water companies across the country will ultimately find themselves facing fatbergs the size of mountains .			0

stinking mass of congealed rotting fat and other sickening waste found
sewage workers have never seen the likes of the mass - as big as a bus
it could have sent sewage surging onto the streets of south @entity32
