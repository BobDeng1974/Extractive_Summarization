the @entity0 plans to utilize 3d printing technology to build warheads with smaller more compact parts that both save the army money and allow for more security measures			1
' 3d printing of warheads will allow us to have better design control and utilize geometries and patterns that previously could not be produced or manufactured , ' @entity7 , a researcher at the @entity9 told @entity15			1
@entity7 explains that since 3d printing allows for smaller more precise parts and more sensors , it will make for a safer design that wo n't break the bank			1
precision also allows for more effective and lethal weapons			0
small parts mean big changes : @entity26 printed parts may transform the way that the @entity0 builds weapons such as warheads and missiles ' warheads could be designed to meet specific mission requirements whether it is to improve safety to meet an @entity36 requirement , or it could have tailorable effects , better control , and be scalable to achieve desired lethality , ' @entity7 said			2
3d printing could allow for the printing of intricate structures all at once as oppose to individually assembling a weapon 's parts			2
' 3d printing also allows for integrating components together to add capabilities at reduced total life cycle costs , ' @entity7 explained			2
3d printing will also make munitions more affordable			0
' it is expected that @entity26 will reduce life - cycle costs of certain items and make munitions more affordable in the long run through implementation of design for manufacturability , and capitalizing on the add capabilities that 3d printing and additive manufacturing can bring to munitions and warheads			1
' more efficient : 3d printers allow for mass producing precise parts that will add to weapon safety and lethality all at a cheaper price the @entity68 reports that so far the army has utilized 3d technology to make bio printed skin for wounded soldiers			1
technology can scan a soldier 's injury and replicate it so that doctors can practice treating certain types of wounds			2
' many of the injuries soldiers receive the field are not traditional			0
a lot of the medical community sees [ 3d printing ] as a new approach to medicine			0
we can 3d scan injuries			0
we can replicate with those injuries are			0
surgeons and medics can practice on those specific types of injuries and provide better service to the war fighter , ' said @entity97 , director of the @entity98			0
whether it 's healing soldiers or producing state of the art technology , the @entity100 army has 3d printers on the brain			0
' maybe someday an entire warhead or rocket could be produced as the technology further matures , ' said @entity7			1
second skin : the @entity0 has already begun using 3d printers to replicate soldier 's wounds so that doctors can practice healing different types of war specific injuries			1

3d printing allows for more precise parts and more sensors thereby creating a safer design that wo n't break the bank
the @entity0 uses @entity26 skin to replicate soldier 's wounds for research and to create bio printed skin
' maybe someday an entire warhead or rocket could be produced as the technology further matures , ' said an army researcher
