by @entity0 published : 18:32 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 18:33 est , 25 october 2013 it 's the snack with a proud history stretching back over more than 75 years			2
but the @entity3 is about to have its recipe changed – as part of the new phase of a public health drive			0
the @entity9 will today announce the details of a campaign called the ‘ @entity12 ’ - a partnership with the food industry aimed at reducing the nation ’s consumption of saturated fat			1
as part of the scheme , @entity18 has signed up to change the oil used to make the wafer filling in its best - selling @entity3			2
the move will cut out 3,800 tonnes of saturated fat from more than a billion bars every year			1
changes : the @entity3 is getting a revamp , with a more healthy recipe but despite the alteration , which will see saturated fat levels in a standard four - finger chocolate bar come down from 7.2g to 6.4g , manufacturers @entity18 are insisting that the new recipe is not going to compromise the product ’s taste			1
managing director @entity35 said : ‘ improving the nutritional profile of @entity3 does not come at the expense of quality and taste - consumers will continue to enjoy the same @entity3 as they have for over 75 years			0
’ he added : ‘ this is the next step on the journey where we are improving the nutritional profile of our products			0
‘ @entity3 is our biggest confectionery brand and therefore the obvious choice to identify a saturated fat reduction			1
’ the deal will also see @entity50 , @entity51 ’s and @entity52 reduce fat in their products including some of their own - brand spreads , cheese and breadsticks			2
@entity58 , which is part of @entity60 and owns the @entity62 brand , will reformulate products such as @entity65 breakfast biscuits and @entity67 chocolate cookies			0
@entity68 will cut the amount of saturated fat in their ‘ @entity71 ’ children ’s meal by more than 70 per cent , and catering giant @entity74 – which serves more than a million meals a day across their 7,000 sites - will promote healthier menus as part of the pledge			1
@entity80 and creamy : the @entity18 snack will change the oil it uses to make the biscuit 's wafer - but the manufacturers insist that taste will not be compromised as well as this , @entity87 and @entity88 have promised to reformulate products and look at reducing portion sizes			1
and the nation ’s 10,500 fish and chip shops are being encouraged to switch to healthier oils , such as @entity96 , which contain less of the fat			0
public health minister @entity98 said : ‘ one in six male deaths and one in nine female deaths are from coronary heart disease - this is why it is critical that we challenge the way we eat and that we all make changes where we can			0
’ she added : ‘ it ’s hugely encouraging that companies providing almost half the food available on the @entity112 market have committed to this @entity12 and are leading the way to give their customers healthier products and lower fat alternatives			0

the @entity18 snack will now be made using different oil
this will reduce the saturated fat in each bar from 7.2g to 6.4g
but manufacturers insist that taste will not be compromised
