the share of @entity1 in the workforce has sunk to its lowest point in 35 years			1
it 's a sign of both an aging population and of unemployed people who have given up on their dispiriting job hunts			1

low point : the share of @entity1 in the workforce is at its lowest point in 35 years a gauge known as the labor force participation rate measures the proportion of working - age adults who either have a job or are looking for one			1
this rate fell to 63.2 percent last year , its lowest level point 1978 , according to the @entity33			1
the rate had peaked at 67.1 percent during the late 1990s			0
at the time , it was buoyed by a strong economy , the baby boom generation entering its peak earning years and the entrance of more women into the workforce			1

economists differ over which single factor best explains the decline in labor force participation			0
but few dispute that the trend will likely persist			0
