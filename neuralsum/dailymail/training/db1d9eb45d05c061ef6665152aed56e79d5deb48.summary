there is a contentious agenda at @entity3 's @entity2 , which starts at 11.30am			1
you can follow the main talking points as they are debated , with @entity6 in attendance at the @entity8			2
the agm has had a familiar theme over the last 10 years : patience			1
chief executive @entity11 was preaching that message yet again earlier this week ahead of the meeting - so @entity15 fans could n't be blamed for thinking it was @entity17			1
@entity19 's men won the @entity20 in may , ending their nine - year trophy drought , but there have been few signs this season that @entity3 are ready to mount a serious challenge for the @entity27 title or the @entity29 - @entity19 's holy grail - despite the summer signings of @entity31 and @entity32			1
@entity11 is set to issuer a similar speech at thursday 's agm , but whether the club 's loyal fans and ambitious shareholders are ready to accept the endless calls to wait remains to be seen			1
host commentator @entity6 : it 's all over for another year			2
phew ! it was all very civilised in the end			2
now it is time for questions from the floor : ' were there funds available to strengthen the defence			1
if so why were n't they spent ? ' @entity49 : ' it 's not my wish to double guess what @entity19 wants to do			1
@entity19 calls the shots on football			1
' @entity19 then declines to explain why he has n't signed a defender since @entity58 exit			1
and why does @entity19 never use a 4 - 4 - 2 formation , a system which provided him with the most success in the early part of his @entity3 career ? wenger : ' it 's about balance			1
we have many creative players through the middle			2
so it 's difficult to find a balance between attacking and defending			2
in @entity74 it 's difficult because you ca n't lose a midfielder			2
but you will certainly see it during the season , maybe when @entity80 is fit			2
' @entity11 is then asked for his opinions on an overseas @entity27 game			1
' we have never asked for that , ' @entity11 said			1
' but the @entity27 should not rest on its laurels			1
all avenues should be explored , but it 's far too early to make a judgement on an overseas game			2
' question about the diversity of the @entity3 board			1
it 's currently all male and white			2
@entity95 : ' we will worry about the diversity			2
' @entity11 is then asked about the @entity98 living wage : ' policy on wages is to give out workers attractive rates of pay			1
they are all about statutory rates			2
the issue is subject of debate , this is a matter for government and we will abide by the decisions they make			2
' @entity11 is then asked about safe standing : ' we are open to safe standing , but it 's a matter for the authorities			1
' and then why the club have big cash reserves which are not being spent on transfers			1
' the topic is far more complex than has been reported			0
we do try to keep a reasonable amount in reserve and a reasonable amount for transfers			0
we do n't publicly disclose the amount we do have in reserve			0
but it 's untrue to say we are sitting on cash we do n't want to use			0
' the cost of travelling to away games is then put to the @entity3 board ... @entity11 said : ' we realise the high cost of travelling to away games			1
each club have their own ticketing policies , and we are an attractive proposition for clubs			1
we will be providing away fans with a £ 10 refreshment club voucher over the @entity140 period			2
' question about the succession planning for @entity19 's departure : @entity144 said : ' i do n't comment on other clubs , good luck to them and their problems			1
think that talk is premature , but we follow the situation very closely			0
this club will always be attractive for the best managers in the world			2
but we are keeping an eye on it			0
' and here 's more from @entity19 on the club 's transfer policy : ' we won the @entity20 with a difficult run , but we managed to deliver the trophy and it makes us stronger , more confident and i believe we will have a strong season			1
we bought good players , i believe we 've done remarkably well in the transfer market			0
we wanted one more player , but could n't			0
we will try to rectify that in january			0
we have a good core of young @entity169 players , who feel the value of our club			2
slowly the modern game has lost that			0
so we need your support again			0
i encourage you to be behind us			0
and i 'm sure we will come out this season more united and stronger			0
' and now we here from @entity19 , who recently celebrated his 18th year in charge of the club			1
‘ this is always an important part of my season , i know you are ambitious , critical and sceptical , but you are very loyal			0
and i 'm very grateful to see the same faces because we love this club			2
i know i do n't always please you like i love to , but we give it all to make you happy			0
let ’s remember last season we started with a home defeat and i felt a little tsunami around the club			2
there was pressure for us to sign players and scepticism			0
we showed we were united , together and ready to work hard			0
what has changed compared to a few years ago is other clubs have resources so top players have more choices			2
we signed @entity198 which gave us comfort			0
we made 79 points and you have to be consistent for that			0
when we lost , we lost [ heavily ]			0
we lost five or six			0
if you concede the first goal in a big game 85 per cent of the time you will lose the game			0
' majority shareholder @entity210 has taken to the floor : ' we are proud of what we 've accomplished			1
what a wonderful day that was at @entity214			0
one of the reasons we were interested in @entity3 was because of @entity19 , and we look forward to much more success with him			1
' @entity6 : the formal business of these agms are always mind - numbing but essential			0
@entity222 appointed to the board			0
we start with a question concerning the £ 3million fee paid to @entity210 that was highlighted in recent accounts			1
sir @entity144 answers : ' the fee was proposed by the myself and @entity231 for the services of @entity210			1
there was no competitive tender for this process as it was directly available to us and would have been inappropriate			0
' on this very day a decade ago , @entity3 went a 49th game unbeaten with a 3 - 1 victory against @entity238 - the final match of their unbeaten run ‘ at the time when you do it , it just looks normal and natural , ' said @entity19 earlier on thursday			1
' when i look back at the photos today and i see the quality of each player , i think that ’s where you realise that it was an exceptional team			0
not only those who played regularly , but also those who were on the bench			0
' it had never been done in the @entity27 until then and i ca n’t remember anybody winning the championship without losing a game			1
i ’m very proud of that because there ’s not a lot of room to do better			0
apart from that , the quality of the players i had was absolutely exceptional			0
’ come on , @entity3 fans , we want to hear from you			1
what should @entity271 be saying today ? send us a tweet and we 'll get the best opinions up on the site ... back to @entity276 and @entity277 , one of the @entity27 's smallest players , has revealed he can walk under team - mate per @entity281 's legs without ducking			1
' it 's easy for me because he 's so tall , ' @entity277 says			0
' he 's a great guy			0
' stay tuned for more ground - breaking revelations … and now , for the first time today , we cross over to our man reporting at the @entity8			0
ladies and gentlemen , it gives me the great pleasure to introduce mr @entity293			0
' @entity294 here in the @entity296 at the @entity8 ahead of this year 's @entity2 , ' @entity293 reports			1
' the @entity20 win should take the edge off things , but it still could be feisty			1
it kicks off in 10 minutes or so			0
' while we wait for the @entity2 , a selection of @entity3 players have been answering questions sent in by the club 's fans			1
@entity307 has described @entity15 legend @entity308 as @entity3 's finest player and revealed @entity310 is his best mate at the club : ' i 've known him for 10 years now and i know everything about him ... including his secrets ! ' oo - er. @entity19 has completed his morning press conference and will join members of @entity3 's board for the @entity2 , which begins at 11.30am			1
the @entity318 has revealed that defender @entity319 is out of saturday 's home clash against @entity321 , along with @entity198 , who has a knee injury			1
but better news comes in the form of @entity325 , who is expected to be back in action at @entity327 in the @entity29 next week			0
@entity198 ( left ) and @entity3 have endured a frustrating start to the season in the @entity27 @entity19 has finally ended @entity3 's trophy drought but his side look nowhere near title challengers @entity3 's chief executive @entity11 ( left ) and majority owner @entity210 ( right ) @entity32 and @entity31 arrived at @entity3 in the summer for a combined fee of £ 46million			1

@entity3 hold their @entity2 on thursday
@entity19 , @entity210 and @entity11 are in line to face questions
@entity11 wants club to reach level of @entity342 , @entity343 and @entity344 , but has preached patience
@entity3 won first trophy in nine years after beating @entity321 in @entity20 final in may , but look far from @entity27 title challengers
