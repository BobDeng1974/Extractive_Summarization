does your spoilt furry friend turn their nose at the ordinary dog food , refuse to chow down on the ' not so fancy ' stuff or just picks at their food and gives you that look when you dish it up ? well now there 's a solution , or at least for a couple nights of the week , @entity12 '			0
there 's no doubt that many @entity16 pets are getting the royal treatment these days with a lot of us seeing our furry friends like they 're our very own children			0
now we can spoilt them even more ...			0
with the online company stepping out of the box and appealing to the pet lovers of the nation and this month it has launched a food home delivery service for pets , literally the ' @entity27 '			1
that 's for a dog ? the @entity27 meals are just like ' people food ' and your pet can indulge in takeaway with you delicious ...			1
no doubt pets are loving the @entity12 '			0
8 @entity39 restaurants have jumped on board offer pet owners the choice of getting their furry friend takeaway too that 's for me ? this dog ca n't believe his luck ...			2
. he probably had the penne and we 're not talking about ' so chumpy you can carve it ' from a can type meals or the fishy tastes of ' @entity54 ' but actual gourmet ' people food ' so that when we order in the takeaway dishes we love , we can also grab something tasty for our pets too			1
@entity59 say they wanted to include the whole family so that means ' buster ' the dog and ' @entity64 ' the cat can indulge in saturday night take out , cooked by local restaurants , which can easily be added to any takeaway order			2
* @entity68 in a meat sauce with chicken , zucchini , carrots , and pumpkin ( $ 6 / $ 8 ) @entity74 , @entity75 * goat masala with rice and vegetables ( $ 5 / $ 8 ) @entity79 , @entity80 * grilled chicken kebab with rice and tomatoes ( $ 9 ) @entity84 , @entity85 * boiled chicken fillet with turmeric and garden vegetables ( $ 5 / $ 8 ) taste of @entity90 , @entity91 * grilled chicken breast with mushrooms and pasta ( $ 6.50 ) @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 dips @entity98 , @entity96 * bbq chicken with rice mushrooms and eggplant ( $ 5 / $ 8 ) @entity103 cafe , @entity102 * poached chicken fillet with rice and vegetables ( @entity107 ) ( $ 5 ) @entity108 2 , @entity109 they guarantee the @entity111 will arrive piping hot at the door with the rest of the family dinner			1
just another reason for @entity116 to chase the delivery driver ! at the moment only eight restaurants within @entity39 are taking part in the unique concept and it 's pretty easy to do			2
all you need to do is go to the @entity59 website , pick a @entity27 restaurant , order your own meals online , then follow up with something for your best mate too			2
simple ! online company , @entity59 is appealing to the pet lovers of the nation and have launched a food home delivery service for pets , literally the ' doggy bag ' not just for dogs , @entity136 for everyone all the @entity27 meals are prepared specially for pets and are low in seasoning ' the idea came about after an @entity144 's joke i suggested to do takeaway food for pets ' @entity59 marketing executive @entity146 told @entity148			1
' then we realised it was n't a joke and it could actually work			0
' and looking through the different assortment of meals for your pets there 's no doubt they will get a pleasant surprise when their @entity27 meal arrives			2
just like they 're from the human main menu , @entity27 meals include dishes such as , penne in a meat sauce with chicken , zucchini , carrots and pumpkin for a bargain price of $ 6 or $ 8 from @entity173 's cafe in @entity75			1
maybe your pets like to go super gourmet with a goat marsala with rice and vegetables from @entity179 , @entity80 or how about sharing a late night snack after a few drinks ( of water ) with a grilled chicken kebab with rice and tomatoes from @entity186 and kebabs , @entity85			1
and it 's not just for dogs , they cater for everyone , with all dishes cooked to @entity193			0
some of the areas where ' @entity111 ' are available			0
8 @entity39 restaurants are currently participating with plans to expand across @entity39 and eventually nationally mmmmmhhh dinner ! restaurants have a range of menu items including penne with chicken , goat marsala , chicken kebab and chicken with tumeric @entity208 do you feel like @entity209 tonight ? why not get a ' @entity107 ' for your pooch with your pad thai should be go carbs tonight ? pets can have a grilled chicken breast with mushrooms and pasta at @entity95 at @entity218 pets can get a large or a small meal , i bet most would go for the large right ! ! at anywhere form $ 5 to $ 10 bucks a pop , it 's just like an extra side to your meal and hey if you 're extra hungry , you could probably even pinch some of ' fidos ' , that 's if he let 's you			1
but probably what most caring pet owners are thinking is , will this be safe for our beloved ' max ' or ' kitty ' to chow down on ? @entity59 says all the @entity27 meals are prepared specially for our furry friends and participating restaurants have been briefed on what they can and ca n't use			1
' they 're very simple dishes , ' mr @entity146 told @entity148 , ' @entity241 for instance , are toxic to dogs			0
and everything is very low in seasoning			0
' ' the owner of @entity247 in @entity91 was like ' i really want to do chicken with turmeric but i do n't know if turmeric 's ok for dogs '			0
so he went across the road and talked with a vet who said it was fine			0
' but while there 's only eight eateries that are catering for our pets , we can expect to see more , @entity59 has plans to expand across @entity39 and eventually nationally			1
so pet lovers , who like their pal to eat as good as they do , watch this space , you could soon be dining together with your furry friend from a restaurant near you			0
@entity59 has plans to expand ' @entity27 ' beyond the 8 @entity39 restaurants to right across @entity39 and eventually nationally all meals are specifically made for pets and low in seasoning @entity59 launched @entity27 in october			1
