the group was formed in april 2013 and grew out of @entity30 's affiliate organisation in @entity73			2
it has since become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in @entity5			1
its precise size is unknown , but it is thought to include thousands of fighters , including many foreign jihadists			0
analysts say non-syrians constitute a majority of @entity27 's elite fighter corps and are disproportionately represented in its leadership			2
it holds sway in a number of towns close to the @entity91 border in the north of the country , and has gained a reputation for brutal rule in the areas that it controls			0
the group has been operating independently of other jihadist groups such as the @entity100 and has had a tense relationship with other rebels in @entity5			2

tens of thousands took to the streets in government - held areas even before the results were announced on wednesday evening , waving portraits of @entity123 and the official @entity5 flag			2
but there are widespread claims of vote - rigging in a nation that remains sharply divided in bitter conflict			0
critics said that many of those who voted did so more out of fear than commitment to @entity123 , whose family has ruled @entity5 with a rod of iron for four decades			0
opposition activists say the election was likely to prolong the conflict that has devastated their country and driven nearly half the population from their homes and sparked an exodus of nearly three million refugees abroad			0
meanwhile , president @entity156 's top foreign policy advisor @entity155 on friday said @entity157 was providing ' lethal and non-lethal ' support to select members of the @entity5 opposition , offering more detail than usual on @entity164 assistance			1
top obama administration officials typically declined to say exactly what equipment , arms or ammunition the @entity164 is providing to moderate @entity5 opposition forces			1
but president @entity156 said in a major foreign policy speech last week that the @entity164 would ' ramp up ' support for rebels fighting president @entity123			0
national security advisor @entity155 said in an interview with @entity175 while she was traveling with @entity156 to d - day 70th anniversary celebrations in @entity177 that she was heartbroken about the carnage in @entity5 's civil war			0
' that 's why the @entity164 has ramped up its support for the moderate vetted opposition , providing lethal and non-lethal support where we can to support both the civilian opposition and the military opposition			1

meanwhile , president @entity156 's top foreign policy advisor said @entity157 was providing ' lethal and non-lethal ' support to select members of the @entity5 opposition fighting president @entity123 ( right ) signs of a deepening commitment to @entity5 rebels come three weeks after @entity156 met the head of the opposition @entity211 , @entity210 in @entity157 last month			1
officially , @entity164 support for rebel fighters in @entity5 has been limited to non-lethal aid amounting to $ 287 million , though the @entity215 reportedly participates in a secret programme to train moderate rebels in @entity218			1
opposition leaders are particularly dismayed that the @entity164 has balked at providing anti-aircraft missiles to rebels , fearing they could fall into the wrong hands			0
