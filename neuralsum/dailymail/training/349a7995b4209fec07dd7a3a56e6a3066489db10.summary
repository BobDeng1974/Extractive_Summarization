selling houses @entity2 's green - fingered design landscaper @entity1 is living every gardener 's dream			1
not only is he the lifestyle channel 's resident garden guru , father to two adorable boys and a thriving business owner , but now he will be representing @entity2 at the world famous @entity10 in may			1
having volunteered to help build and exhibit a space for famous @entity15 garden designer @entity14 at last year 's show , this year it 's @entity17 's time to shine and his very personal garden is sure to amaze			2
with that in mind , his garden represents the three most important parts of his life , a way of expressing his personal milestones since his father passed away			1
‘ he does n't know that i was living in @entity2 or have a family or children or anything like that , ' @entity1 told @entity41			1
' so i thought it would be nice to do a garden that celebrates his life and it would be a space that i could talk to him about my life			2
' @entity1 said he was devastated when his beloved father passed away from cancer , but the strong bond his family shares got him through the tough time			1
‘ it ’s not easy when any loved one passes away			0
my sister was three years younger and my brother three years older and obviously it ’s not nice for anything like that to happen			0
luckily we ’re a very close family and we support each other really well			0
' the 33 - year - old 's garden design is heavily influenced by the tragic passing of his father @entity1 's brother now lives in @entity61 and his sister has set up home in @entity64			1
both are them are flying to the @entity66 along with his wife , mother and children to support the tv personality			0
' they ’re all coming back to see this garden so it means a lot , ' he said			2
one of @entity1 's biggest regrets is that his father never got to meet his precious baby boys			1
‘ it definitely would have been nice for my father to meet them and my mum loves them more than anything , ' he said			2
@entity1 , who lives on the @entity81 with his wife @entity82 and their two boys @entity85 , 2 and @entity86 , 3 months , got involved in the world of landscaping and design by pure coincidence			1
born in @entity64 , @entity1 moved to @entity15 when he was 12 - years - old			1
while out driving one day he spotted a drunk driver who had smashed into the gate of a huge country manor			0
the next day @entity1 returned to the house as he had taken the driver 's number plate details			1
that was where he was offered his first job landscaping			0
by the age of 18 , @entity1 had saved up enough money to travel to @entity2 , where he has been living ever since			1
while studying at @entity102 , @entity1 received an email from @entity104 telling him he should try out for a place on a new show			1
@entity1 applied and he had been working for @entity2 ever since			1
@entity1 and his wife @entity82 , who he honours in his garden designs he now considers himself a pure @entity109 and is proud to be representing his adopted country			1
' i like to think that i 'm representing @entity2 and the rest of my team are @entity109 , my training , my life my family are all in @entity2 , ' he said			1
' i see myself as an @entity109 going over there rather than an @entity15 going back , ' between working tirelessly on @entity2 for the past eight years and running his own successful business in @entity120 , it 's a wonder @entity1 has found the time to fit in the @entity10 but he insists he could not imagine himself doing anything else			1
' i get up at 4am and go to bed about 11pm			0
' i try to fit in a bit of family time but it 's mainly work			0
i absolutely love what i do , it never feels like a chore			0
@entity1 will be one of eight designers showcasing their work over the course of the five day show in @entity10			1
his garden will be judged against his own brief and he will also be up for the @entity138 category in the competition , his garden will have the opportunity to be previewed by members of the royal family			2
' we ’ve got our fingers crossed			0
i ’ve said to all the guys working on the show i want our garden to be the best and do the best that they can do and if they can give me that and i can do the best that i can do			2
we ’ve got to be happy with the result we get , ' he said			0
this will be the 11th year an @entity109 has taken part in the @entity156 's annual show and @entity1 admits that the pressure is on			1
one of @entity159 's garden designs titled ' @entity160 , ' which is based on an award winning design by @entity109 landscaper @entity163 in 2013 @entity109 landscaper @entity163 won the @entity138 award for his collaboration with @entity166			2
the nature garden made history as an @entity109 team had never achieved such success at the show			2
@entity1 hopes to emulate @entity163 's victory with his garden which he has called ' @entity160 '			1
' there is a lot of pressure because the last @entity109 who was at @entity10 won it , ' he said , ' there ’s the added pressure of being on television , people expect you to do well because they know you from tv and there ’s the pressure that i put on myself			2
i 've invested a lot of time and money into it and it will be pointless if i do n’t do well			0
' his intricate design will feature many @entity109 influences with sandstone he sourced from the @entity195 and shipped to the @entity66			0

the path is meant to be wide enough so he can walk down it his father and his two kids			0
' the path is two metres wide so i can walk down it with my father and children @entity227 , ' he said			0
the central section is based around a large water feature that is four and a half metres across			0
it empties within five seconds to represent the feeling of life slipping away			0
@entity1 was with his father when he passed away and he said the water feature symbolises the feeling of not being able to bring someone back , knowing what 's happening to them and not being able to stop it			1
above this , hanging off the wall , will be a copper sculpture designed by @entity1 and young award - winning sculpture @entity243			2
the rear section is a sunken intimate courtyard that focuses around a dry stone fire pit , which represents @entity1 's wife as the centre and fire in his life			2
