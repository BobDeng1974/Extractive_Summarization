@entity0 may be one of @entity3 's most popular workout classes , but it appears one star is decidedly not a fan			1
after complaining bitterly about the terrible weather during tuesday night 's episode of @entity9 's @entity10 , host @entity6 went off on an abrupt tangent that saw him slamming the indoor cycling studio			1
if i wanted a lesbian to yell at me i 'd go to the @entity15 ! ' he declared , referring to a famous lesbian and gay bar in @entity17			0
' i would n't step foot in @entity0 , ' said @entity26 , and @entity28 agreed			1
' we would n't step crotch [ in a @entity0 class , it hurts the kitty cat ! ' the @entity34 of @entity35 exclaimed , gesturing between her legs			2
@entity6 , who once confessed that he was ' obsessed ' with @entity0 , was prompted to begin his diatribe after introducing his @entity38 of the day : ' white chicks ' who push him out of the way on the subway when it 's raining			1
thanks to the inclement weather , @entity17 's subway system has been particularly crowded recently - and @entity6 insists that women on their way to @entity0 classes are the main source of the problem			1
' i 'm sorry i c * * k - blocked your warm - up at @entity0 , white ladies ! ' he joked			2
the studio audience cheered at his reference to the indoor cycling studio , suggesting they all felt the same way			0
meow : @entity26 ( r ) and @entity28 ( @entity61 ) voiced their agreement with @entity28 saying that the cycling classes ' hurt the kitty cat ' spitting with anger : @entity6 's furious rant about @entity0 was prompted by his annoyance at the ' white chicks ' who barge him out of the way on the subway viewers shared their reactions to the comment on @entity75 , with one person writing : ' @entity6 just threw so much shade at soulcycle # wwhl # hilarious '			1
another fan wrote : ' @entity0 haters unite , ' and a third said : ' best part of your @entity38 was you hating on @entity0 ! ' the 46 - year - old tv personality also bad - mouths the workout in his new book , the @entity86			1
an excerpt reads : ' i met @entity89 and @entity90 at @entity0 , which i had n't done in a couple years because i always feel like if i wanted to be screamed at by lesbians , i ’d go to the @entity15			2
' the same s * * * coming out of the mouths of these @entity0 instructors that made me go nuts years ago did again today - faux inspiration and " depth " spurted out with the passion of a @entity98 ’s drive - through operator , ' he continues			0
' i got depressed by the tribes of @entity101 in a place shallow enough to make this dime - store philosophy meaningful			0
' devoted fans : although @entity0 boasts an impressive celebrity following , including the likes of @entity108 ( @entity61 ) and @entity109 ( r ) , it seems as though the workout 's popularity may be dwindling wearing it on their sleeve : @entity115 ( @entity61 ) and @entity116 ( r ) have both attended @entity0 classes in the past while wearing the brand 's own line of workout gear he does put a somewhat positive spin on the experience though , concluding it : ' that being said , i sweated out a bottle of tequila and almost puked twice , so i think the workout was a success			1
’ while @entity6 might not be a fan of the classes , they have built up an impressive celebrity following over the years			1
several @entity134 , including @entity135 and @entity136 , have credited the workout with helping them to maintain their supermodel figures , while @entity109 , @entity140 and even @entity141 have all previously sung their praises to @entity0 , which launched in 2006 and charges $ 32 for a 45 - minute group class			2
but while it has maintained its cult - like status for the past few years , it seems the reign of @entity0 may be over			0
indeed , these days many perceive it as a hobby of the ' basic b * * * * ' , as exemplified in a holiday gift guide published on @entity150			0
celebrity favorite : despite @entity6 's feelings about the classes , they have managed to amass an impressive following from a wide variety of famous faces ' by day , she 's front row in her @entity0 class			1
by night , she 's swapping out her @entity161 for margs on the rocks , ' reads the article			0
' and , by now , we 've all heard about the " basic b * * * *			0
" while some wholeheartedly embrace the term ( bros included ) , others cringe at the thought of being a walking cliché			0
' and just last month , @entity0 faced negative press when lawyer @entity172 claimed his membership to the studio had been revoked simply because he was representing a former instructor in a case			0
the lawsuit stated that @entity0 's owners @entity178 and @entity180 barred both mr @entity172 and his client from working out at the facilities just four days after he filed a federal wage theft claim .			2

@entity6 's guests , @entity26 and @entity28 , were quick to voice their agreement
*ironically* , the tv host has previously admitted to being ' obsessed ' with @entity0 classes
