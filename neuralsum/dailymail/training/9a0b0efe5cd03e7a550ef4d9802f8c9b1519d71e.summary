scientists have released high quality images of the brain that they claim will have a ‘ major impact ’ on our understanding of the organ			1
following a five year project involving more than 100 researchers from ten institutions , the experts have released the data that they hope will enable the exploration of the relationships between brain circuits and an individual 's behaviour			1
the @entity17 , which involves scientists across @entity19 and the @entity20 , aims to collect data using advanced brain imaging methods , and to make the data freely available so that scientists worldwide can make further discoveries about brain circuitry			1
the areas in yellow are those that are strongly linked to the area with the blue dot the initial data release includes brain imaging scans plus behavioural information — individual differences in personality , cognitive capabilities , emotional characteristics and perceptual function — obtained from 68 healthy adult volunteers			2
it is particularly notable because the new data is of much higher resolution , and is therefore more detailed , than data obtained by conventional brain scans			2
over the next few years the number of people studied will increase until the researchers reach their final target of 1,200			0
the @entity17 consortium is led by dr @entity57 , alumni endowed professor at @entity58 in @entity59			1
one of the ' connection maps ' created by the team , which shows pathways in the brain of volunteers the project will publish all of its data online and make it accessible for researchers he said : ‘ by making this unique data set available now , and continuing with regular data releases every quarter , the @entity17 is enabling the scientific community to immediately begin exploring relationships between brain circuits and individual behaviour			1
‘ the @entity17 will have a major impact on our understanding of the healthy adult human brain , and it will set the stage for future projects that examine changes in brain circuits underlying the wide variety of brain disorders afflicting humankind			1
’ a composite of the scans of 20 individuals			0
regions in yellow and red are linked to the parietal lobe of the brain 's right hemisphere yellow and red regions are activated by a task involving listening to stories , whereas green and blue regions are more strongly activated by a task involving arithmetic calculations the data set includes information about brain connectivity in each individual , using two distinct magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity106 ) approaches			2
one is based on spontaneous fluctuations in functional mri signals that occur in a complex pattern in space and time throughout the gray matter of the brain			2
another , called diffusion imaging , provides information about the long - distance ‘ wiring ’ – the anatomical pathways traversing the brain ’s white matter			0
brain activations in the brain 's grey matter			0
yellow and red regions are activated when subjects view human faces each subject was also scanned while performing a variety of tasks within the scanner , thereby providing extensive information about brain activation patterns			0
behavioural data using a variety of tests performed outside the scanner are being released along with the scan data for each subject			0
the subjects are drawn from families that include siblings , some of whom are twins			0
this will enable studies of the heritability of brain circuits			0
dr @entity148 , assistant professor of radiology and director of the @entity151 at @entity58 , said : ‘ the @entity17 represents a major advance in sharing brain imaging data in ways that will accelerate the pace of discovery about the human brain in health and disease			1

the @entity17 released high quality images of the brain
they say it will have a ' major impact ' on our understanding of the organ
the project aims to make advanced brain images freely available
