by @entity0 published : 18:49 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 18:49 est , 5 october 2013 under fire : @entity4 @entity3 boss @entity2 has seen a 109 page dossier containing allegations of sexual harassment and bullying at the corporation shocking allegations of sexual harassment and bullying at the @entity4 are laid bare for the first time today after the disclosure of a confidential report to @entity16			1
the 109 - page dossier , seen by senior executives at the @entity4 including under - fire hr manager @entity2 , includes claims that : the damning dossier – called @entity21 at the @entity4 – was compiled by the @entity22 and was one of the pieces of evidence submitted to senior managers at the @entity4 last december after it commissioned an inquiry into sexual harassment and bullying			1
the inquiry , the @entity30 – also known as the @entity31 – was led by @entity32			1
despite the allegations , ms @entity2 said in january there was ‘ not a particular problem ’ with bullying and maintained the issue was historic when the @entity31 was published in may			2
mps last night called for an urgent review into the dossier with @entity41 mp saying he would press the issue with @entity4 director general @entity44			2
mr @entity41 , chairman of the @entity45 , said : ‘ these are strong claims			0
' they provide further evidence of a long - standing culture of bullying and harassment of employees in the @entity4			1
' we want to be assured changes are being made by management and we need to be told what these are			0
’ damning : the @entity4 dossier was compiled by the @entity22 and was one of the pieces of evidence submitted to senior managers at the @entity4 last december @entity63 mp said what happened in the @entity66 department ‘ could easily be described as misogyny ’ , adding there were now questions over the role of ms @entity2 in the @entity31			1
he added : ‘ @entity71 looks increasingly like a @entity73 operation for the @entity4 rather than a real attempt to get to grips with its own rotten culture			2
’ the dossier gives details of a claim that a woman was offered a promotion if she accepted dinners with the boss			1
‘ i naturally declined , but another temporary marketing manager , covering maternity leave , accepted and she was given the job , ’ the woman said			1
women in the @entity66 department said they were told to cover - up and ‘ act like good @entity92 girls ’ – and allege bullying is still going on			1
one presenter whose boss mouthed the words ‘ you ’re c * * * ’ while she was on air said her bullying experience left her suicidal			1
another allegation is that one manager was given a pay - off before he had a chance to be disciplined for sending filthy messages to female graduates			1
the @entity31 , which was set up in the wake of the @entity109 scandal , took testimonies from 930 staff			0
it looked at @entity4 policies and processes relating to sexual harassment and bullying – and led to the corporation overhauling its bullying and harassment policy			1
ms @entity2 , who was called a liar during a parliamentary committee debate after being accused of changing evidence on executive pay - offs , told @entity4 magazine @entity125 on january 14 there was ‘ no reason to believe we have any particular problems ’ with regard to a bullying culture			1
when the @entity31 was published on may 2 , she acknowledged it ‘ does make uncomfortable reading ’ , but added : ‘ thankfully incidents involving sexual harassment were extremely rare and the @entity4 culture of today is very different to the past			1
' clearly one example is too many but i was pleased to hear that sexual harassment is not something our people were experiencing			0
’ allegations : former newsreader @entity145 hit out at the @entity4 in a @entity146 on sunday article outspoken : @entity145 claimed that once your age exceeds your bra size at the @entity4 you are finished one source close to the investigation said : ‘ @entity2 is the woman who was the @entity4 lead on the @entity31 so she knew the detail intimately			1
these issues happened on her watch and she is now the woman who is effectively in charge of implementing change			0
’ mr @entity63 mp added : ‘ as head of personnel , @entity2 has a lot to answer for and should have been sacked some time ago			0
‘ the fact she is still there suggests a lack of seriousness			0
’ concern : mps last night called for an urgent review into the dossier with @entity41 mp , pictured , saying he would press the issue with @entity4 director general @entity44 the @entity4 was also accused last night of breaking recommendations in the @entity31 over the case in the @entity66 department			1
it was alleged one manager found guilty of bullying was disciplined by a friend – counter to guidelines which said complaints should be transparent and removed from those in any way connected to those involved			2
last week , @entity187 , a producer in the @entity66 department , was given a final written warning after the @entity4 partly upheld several complaints of bullying and harassment			1
mr @entity187 kept his job , but one @entity4 insider said the disciplinary action decision was taken by someone known to him			2
reaction : the @entity31 was set up in the wake of the @entity109 scandal one woman involved is due to complain about the decision			0
in december last year , mr @entity187 emailed one woman ’s father from the @entity4			2
apologising to the woman ’s father for ‘ stooping to a low level ’ , he said his daughter had ‘ violated the ethics of @entity206 , friendship and seniority , as well as those of the @entity4 ’			1
the email could have had disastrous consequences as the woman explained : ‘ in @entity66 culture when you see a woman outside her boundaries then you tell the man in the family to sort that out			2
' if my dad was a different @entity66 man , he would beat me up , physically , and stop me from work			0
’ she added : ‘ i have been on antidepressants for two and a half years			0
' i have to stop it but those made me feel alive			0
’ last month former newsreader @entity145 spoke out against @entity4 sexism in @entity16			2
a @entity4 spokesman said it was now implementing more training and a confidential whistleblowing hotline for staff			0
he said : ‘ the @entity4 initiated the respect at work review to help tackle any form of bullying and to ensure that staff have the confidence to report concerns			2
‘ under @entity2 ’s stewardship the @entity4 has made huge improvements in tackling bullying – including bespoke training and cases now being heard outside of the relevant division			1
' recent information showed there were approximately 30 cases of alleged bullying being investigated in an organisation of almost 17,000 staff			0
’ former @entity253 presenter @entity252 won an employment tribunal against the @entity4 on the grounds of ageism after she was replaced by a younger host			2
the 56 - year - old has also claimed to be a victim of sexual harassment at the hands of a senior @entity4 executive			1
the @entity4 is long on soul - searching but short on culture change			2
i wish i could say i was surprised to read these shocking accounts of bullying and sexual harassment , but sadly i ’m not			0
more than 930 people gave evidence to the @entity32 inquiry			1
some have now withdrawn it because they have no faith in @entity4 promises that they wo n’t be penalised for speaking out			0
age discrimination : @entity275 at open sessions held for staff to discuss their experiences of harassment and bullying there ’s been silence – no one except union representatives have felt they can speak openly without facing repercussions			2
after the respect at @entity30 was published , one highranking staff member left @entity288 , accepting her career had effectively come to an end because she had voiced her concerns over an issue that subsequently tarnished the @entity4 ’s reputation			1
measures introduced after the @entity32 inquiry were designed to cut the grievance procedure for sexual harassment and bullying complaints from 90 to 30 days			1
but the deliberation time has doubled to 180 days and some serious cases have not been resolved at all			0
staff who were brave in coming forward with their experiences now feel the people who made their lives a misery at work will get off lightly because there is no real will by human resources to get to the truth			0
i gave evidence to the @entity32 inquiry about a manager who offered me a job , but i then found out he wanted sexual favours in return			1
when i went to see two senior members of staff for advice about bringing a formal complaint , they warned me that the @entity4 would always side with its managers and that if i went ahead it would be unlikely that i would work for the @entity288 again			0
i was a freelancer at the time and could not afford to take the risk			0
the @entity4 is a national treasure			0
in terms of the quality of its news output , it ca n’t be beaten			0
but the viewing public has to know that behind this facade a culture of fear is allowed to thrive			0
this is because executives are a power unto themselves			0
they stick together and guard each other ’s backs .			0
