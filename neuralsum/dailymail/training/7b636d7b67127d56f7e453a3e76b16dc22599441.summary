@entity0 is in the frame for a surprise place in the @entity4 squad despite not having played this season			1
@entity6 will name his @entity4 squad this week and is seriously considering the former @entity9 star because of an injury crisis in his midfield			0
@entity0 is likely to be joined by @entity13 ’s @entity12 or @entity15 ’s @entity14 , both inexperienced players			2
such is his shortage in midfield , with his captain @entity42 retired and @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 injured and @entity46 yet to play for @entity47 , @entity6 may turn to @entity0 , even though he too has yet to play for his new club @entity22			1
@entity6 was at @entity13 against @entity49 , meaning @entity12 could be an option in central midfield for this week ’s squad , while his assistant @entity53 was at @entity54 checking on @entity55 and @entity57 striker @entity56			0
retired : @entity42 quit international football after the @entity59 injured : @entity45 has been ruled out through injury @entity6 had previously indicated he would turn to @entity0 only in emergencies but he may be forced to do so given his lack of midfield options			0
for the @entity66 , the friendly against @entity65 on september 3 looks to be an increasingly hard sell , with only 15,000 tickets sold and , on the back of the most disappointing @entity59 performance , the attendance is likely to be a record low for an international match at the new @entity74			1
the previous low was when @entity4 played @entity76 in november 2011 , attracting 48,876			0
decisions : @entity6 has some big choices to make in his first @entity80 @entity4 squad goalkeepers : @entity84 ( @entity22 ) , @entity83 ( @entity82 ) , @entity85 ( @entity86 ) ; @entity87 ( @entity88 ) defenders : @entity92 ( @entity9 ) , @entity91 ( @entity90 ) , @entity93 , @entity94 ( both @entity47 ) , @entity95 ( @entity90 ) , @entity96 ( @entity90 ) , @entity97 , @entity98 midfielders : @entity100 , @entity101 ( all @entity102 ) , @entity103 ( @entity22 ) , @entity12 ( a @entity13 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , @entity0 ( @entity104 ) ; sterling strikers : @entity107 , @entity108 ( all @entity88 ) , @entity109 , @entity110 ( both @entity47 )			2

@entity0 looks set to be called up for national team duty despite not having played for new club @entity22
@entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 all ruled out through injury
@entity12 and @entity14 in the frame for first call ups
@entity4 play a friendly with @entity65 at @entity74 on september 3
the @entity4 travel to @entity32 for their first @entity31 qualifier five days later
the @entity66 have only sold 15,000 tickets for the @entity65 game
