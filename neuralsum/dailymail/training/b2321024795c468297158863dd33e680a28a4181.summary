@entity0 's young stars were handed a valuable experience last week when @entity37 took six of the under 21 squad to @entity40 for the @entity42 clash with @entity43			1
but if the 4 - 1 last tuesday was @entity46 delight , this monday it was back to the bread and butter as four of those players took on @entity18 at @entity51			0
@entity52 and @entity10 , both of whom came on at the @entity55 were joined by @entity9 and @entity7 - unused substitutes last week - in a strong starting line - up for @entity0 's second string			1
@entity52 gets up to head in @entity0 's equaliser but the @entity61 fell short despite their dominance it was a far cry for @entity0 's young stars , who last week enjoyed a win over @entity43 with the first team but things could hardly have gone worse for the young @entity61 , as they conceded in the first five minutes , @entity27 finishing nicely after being set through by a chipped through ball			1
@entity0 hit back through @entity52 who headed in an @entity9 cross as the back post after 19 minutes			1
but despite dominating the possession , and having two goals disallowed for offside , the @entity61 could n't find a winner , and were punished by two late @entity18 goals			0
@entity76 took advantage of a mistake by the home goalkeeper @entity79 with three minutes to go , and with @entity0 pushing for an equaliser , @entity76 grabbed a second in stoppage time to round off the win .			2

*bolton* take early lead through @entity27 after just five minutes
@entity0 hit back through @entity52 header 14 minutes later
