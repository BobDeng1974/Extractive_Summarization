the mummified remains were found during renovations to the staircase at 107 @entity33 , @entity10			1
it was originally covered in black hair , but this has faded since the rat was removed			1
it is thought to have been mummified due to the dry conditions inside the cavity			0
typically , microorganisms ‘ eat ’ the body , causing it to decompose , but in certain conditions , these microorganisms die before they get the chance , meaning the bodies do n’t decompose in the same way			0
following the discovery , the rat was taken to the @entity51 by builders j.r @entity54 and @entity53			2
it was then sent to experts who determined the rat had been undisturbed since the 14th century			1
the project was overseen by historian dr @entity58			0
the rat was discovered inside a cavity at 107 @entity33 in @entity10 ( pictured ) in the late 1990s , while renovations were being made to the property ’s staircase			1

the rat was discovered in the late 1990s at 107 @entity33 , @entity10
it was originally found covered in black hair , which has since faded
experts dated the remains to the time of the @entity2 in the 14th century
scratch marks found inside the wall suggest it was interred while still alive
this has led to speculation it was **trapped** to protect residents from disease
other theories suggest the rat was interred to ward off evil spirits , or that it was **trapped** by accident
the preserved rodent is now on display at @entity51
