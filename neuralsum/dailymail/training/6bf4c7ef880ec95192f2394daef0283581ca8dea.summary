by @entity0 published : 10:50 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 14:54 est , 30 april 2013 president @entity1 today defended his administration ’s slow response to reports of chemical weapon use in @entity6 , in spite of his earlier promises that the use of such weapons would be considered ‘ crossing a red line ’			1
the president said at a press conference on tuesday that ‘ there is a whole host of steps that we 've been taking ’ but he did not specifically say whether his administration would be prepared to take military action against @entity21 ’s regime			1
he said the war - torn country is ‘ a blemish on the international community			1
‘ we do n’t want that genie out of the bottle			0
’ photos and videos of civilians were released online last week that reportedly showed victims of chemical weapons attacks in @entity51			1
the president said that his administration is still working to establish a ‘ chain of custody ’ for the weapons used in the attacks , as he says it is unclear exactly who fired them			1
‘ we do n't know when they were used , how they were used			0
we do n't know who used them , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ if we end up rushing to judgement without hard effective evidence ... there may be objections even among some who are sympathetic with the opposition in the region			2
‘ by game changer i mean we would have the rethink the range of options that are available to us			0
like i said we 're already invested in trying to find a solution that is available in @entity6			2
’ he said that his military teams have been compiling ‘ a spectrum of options ’ in terms of possible @entity30 use of force in the region since ‘ as early as last year ’ but they are still evaluating their plan			0
addressing the issue : tuesday 's press conference was the first made by the president since the @entity88 on saturday but relations seemed tense the talk covered a wide range of issues , including his approval of the @entity96 ’s work both leading up to and in response to the @entity99 bombings , his continued disapproval of @entity101 , and the sequester			1
he took the opportunity to reassure @entity30 in the wake of the april 15 bombing , saying that one of the things he was ‘ most proud of ’ following the attack was the resilience that he saw in @entity111			2
‘ you do n’t get a sense that anybody 's intimidated when they go to @entity116 a couple of days after the bombing , ’ he said			2
he defended the work of the @entity96 , even though they have been subject to criticism following the revelation that both the @entity96 and the @entity122 had the elder suspect , @entity123 on terrorist watchlists but he was allowed to re-enter the country following six months abroad where it is believed that he may have become more radicalized			0
‘ it ’s not as if the @entity96 did nothing : they not only investigated the older brother they interviewed the older brother			0
the question then is is there something that happened that triggered radicalization			0
search : president @entity1 said that investigators had identified the perpetrators ' hours ' after they secured the @entity99 crime scene on monday , but the photo of the suspects was not released until thursday ‘ are there additional things that could have been done in that interim that could have prevented ? we wo n’t know that until that review is completed			1
‘ based on what i ’ve seen so far , the @entity96 performed its duties , the @entity152 did what it is supposed to be doing , but this is hard stuff			2
’ he said that @entity157 intelligence forces have been cooperating fully with the investigation , though the relationship between the two countries is still frosty , as a residual side effect of the @entity162			1
' you know , obviously , old habits die hard			1
there are still suspicions sometimes between our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that date back 10 , 20 , 30 years , back to the @entity162			2
but they 're continually improving , ' he said			0
' i 've spoken to president @entity173 directly			0
he 's committed to working with me to make sure that those who report to us are cooperating fully in not only this investigation but how do we work on counter-terrorism issues generally			2
' on the agenda : president @entity1 said that the continued usage of @entity101 prison camp is hurting @entity30 credibility abroad and is being used as a recruitment tool for terrorists president @entity1 also said that another factor hurting our ability to fight terrorism is the continued usage of the @entity101 , where prisoners are currently holding a hunger strike to show their disgust with their treatment			1
' i do n't want these individuals to die ... all of us should reflect on why are we doing this ? why are we doing this ? ' @entity1 said			1
' i think it is critical for us to understand that @entity101 is not necessary to keep @entity30 safe			2
it hurts us in terms of our international standing			0
it lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts			0
it is a recruitment tool for extremists			0
it needs to be closed			0
' facing the critics : president @entity1 has been criticized for not speaking to the press and holding the fewest conferences of many recent presidents , so he took an hour on tuesday to address that point the press conference was the first that the president held since the @entity219 ’ dinner on saturday night , where funny speeches were used to show a lighter relationship between the @entity88 and the press			1
the weekend revelry evaporated during one tense moment when reporter @entity225 asked the president if he had enough ‘ juice ’ to get through the rest of his term , even though a number of his initiatives - including the gun control bill - have been overturned in the first 100 days of his second term			0
‘ if you put it that way @entity238 maybe i should just pack up and go home , golly , ’ the president said jokingly			0
‘ as @entity243 said “ rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point			0
” ’ the last question of the conference was taken on the fly as he was headed out of the briefing room , when someone asked his thoughts on the revelation that basketball player @entity251 is gay			1
' i had a chance to talk to him yesterday			0
he seems like a terrific young man , and , you know , i told him i could n't be prouder of him , ' president @entity1 said			1
' given the importance of sports in our society , for an individual who 's excelled at the highest levels in one of major sports go ahead and say , this is who i am , i 'm proud of it , i 'm still a great competitor , i 'm still seven feet tall and can bang with @entity268 and , you know , deliver a hard foul -- and for , you know , a lot of young people out there who , you know , are -- are -- are , you know , gay or lesbian , who are struggling with these issues , to see a role model like that who 's unafraid , i think it 's a great thing			1
