by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:57 est , 28 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:47 est , 28 december 2013 more than 1 million @entity3 faced a @entity5 jolt this morning as extended federal unemployment benefits came to a halt , with potentially significant implications for the recovering @entity3 economy			1
a tense political battle likely looms when @entity11 reconvenes in the new , midterm election year			2
nudging @entity11 along , a vacationing president @entity13 called two senators who are proposing an extension to offer his support			1
from @entity18 , @entity13 pledged friday to push @entity11 to move quickly next year to address the ' urgent economic priority , ' the @entity17 said			1
for families dependent on cash assistance , the end of the federal government 's ' emergency unemployment compensation ' will mean some difficult belt - tightening as enrollees lose their average monthly stipend of $ 1,166			1
above , the unemployed attend a job fair in @entity31 , @entity32 last august jobless rates could drop , but analysts say the economy may suffer with less money for consumers to spend on everything from clothes to cars			2
having let the ' emergency ' program expire as part of a budget deal , it 's unclear if @entity11 has the appetite to start it anew			1
an estimated 1.3million people will be cut off when the federally funded unemployment payments end saturday			2
some 214,000 @entity49 will lose their payments , a figure expected to rise to more than a half - million by june , the @entity48 said			2
in the last 12 months , @entity49 received $ 4.5billion in federal jobless benefits , much if plowed back into the local economy			1
presidential support : while on vacation in @entity18 on friday , president @entity13 called up two senators proposing an extension on the benefits to voice his support			1
above , mr @entity13 and his wife address a group of @entity62 gathered at a base in @entity64 on @entity65 more than 127,000 @entity66 also will be cut off this weekend			2
in @entity67 , 11th among states in population , 90,000 people will immediately lose out			0
started under president @entity72 , the benefits were designed as a cushion for the millions of @entity3 citizens who lost their jobs in a recession and failed to find new ones while receiving state jobless benefits , which in most states expire after six months			1
another 1.9million people across the country are expected to exhaust their state benefits before the end of june			0
but @entity13 has no quick fix			2
he hailed this month 's two - year budget agreement as a breakthrough of bipartisan cooperation while his administration works with @entity90 allies in the @entity17 and @entity91 to revive an extension of jobless benefits for those unemployed more than six months			1
the @entity13 administration says those payments have kept 11.4 million people out of poverty and benefited almost 17 million children			2
the cost of them since 2008 has totaled $ 225billion			0
at the depth of the recession , laid off workers could qualify for up to 99 weeks of benefits , including the initial 26 weeks provided by states			0
the most recent extension allowed a total of up to 73 weeks , depending on the state			0
restoring up to 47 extra weeks of benefits through 2014 would cost $ 19billion , according to the @entity109			2
@entity17 @entity110 led by @entity111			0
@entity112 of @entity113 and @entity114 of @entity115 sought to include an extension through march by offsetting the costs with potential farm bill savings			0
@entity110 and some @entity120 plan another push in 2014			0
sens. @entity122 , @entity123 , and @entity124 , @entity125 , have introduced a bill offering a similar three - month extension , and senate majority leader @entity128 , @entity129 , has promised to bring it up			2
but as with much in @entity11 , an extension is no sure thing			1
in phone calls on friday , @entity13 told @entity122 and @entity124 he was glad they were working together to address the problem			1
' it defies economic sense , precedent and our values , ' @entity13 economic adviser @entity136 said in a statement			2
a good thing ? some say that the end of federal benefits will cause the long - term unemployed to leave the labor force , resulting in a lower unemployment rate			1
above , a job - seeker in @entity150 fills out an application at a fair last september house speaker @entity152 spoke with @entity13 about an extension earlier this month			1
@entity152 said his caucus would consider the possibility ' as long as it 's paid for and as long as there are other efforts that will help get our economy moving once again			0
' he said the @entity17 has yet to introduce a plan that meets his standards			0
for other @entity120 , the bar is higher			0
many of them look at signs of economic growth and an unemployment rate now down to 7 per cent and expected to drop further as evidence the additional weeks of benefits are no longer necessary			1
the effect of jobless benefits on the unemployment rates has been fiercely debated for decades			0
to qualify , people have to be seeking work			0
tea partiers such as sen. @entity176 of @entity177 argue that the payments aggravate rather than relieve unemployment			0
the benefits allow some jobseekers to hold out for higher wages			0
without the benefits , they might accept lower - paying jobs , reducing the unemployment rate			1
others may be looking for work only to keep the benefits flowing and will drop out of the job market entirely once the checks stop			0
in theory , that also would push the unemployment rate lower			1
the flip side is that the benefits â € ” in addition to alleviating suffering â € ” get spent on consumer goods , stimulating the economy and creating jobs			1
no more spending : the end of federal benefits could have a noticeable impact on the economy since the unemployed will not longer have their monthly stipends to spend , which stimulates the economy			1
above , a career fair held last may in @entity207 extended unemployment insurance ' is really a lifeline to help pay the bills , put food on the table , and put gas in the tank so people can look for work , ' argued @entity217 , policy co-director at the left - leaning @entity218			0
@entity219 , an analyst at @entity220 , said ending the extended benefits will lower the unemployment rate by half a percentage point as the long - term unemployed leave the labor force			1
while that statistical change may look good on the surface , @entity219 cautioned the drop could be accompanied by a similar decrease in consumer spending			0
that would also hurt clothing retailers , car dealers and other @entity234 businesses			0
extending the program , on the other hand , would boost gdp growth by some 0.2 per cent and increase full - time employment by 200,000 next year , the @entity109 estimated , but at the price of increasing the government 's debt			0
advocates of extended benefits say communities hardest hit by the recession will feel the sudden loss of cash in circulation the most			0
they cite a set of their own troublesome figures : three jobseekers still competing for each opening ; some 4million people in the ranks of long - term unemployed ; unemployment lasting on average 37 weeks , two months longer than most states provide insurance .			1

millions of @entity3 lost their federal unemployment benefits on saturday following a new budget deal passed by @entity11
for now , these @entity3 lose their average monthly stipend of $ 1,166
president @entity13 hopes to *reinstate* funding and called up two senators on friday from @entity18 to support their proposed extension
some believe cutting the benefits will actually *improve* the economy - leading to a lower unemployment rate as many drop out of the labor force
others say the impact will be *negative* , since the benefits are spent on consumer goods which stimulate the economy
