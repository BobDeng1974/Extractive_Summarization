you ca n't be the @entity2 manager by default			1
you ca n’t be the @entity2 manager because the @entity5 are out of ideas			1
you ca n’t be the @entity2 manager because we have managed expectations down to a level where picking some new names while losing every game that matters constitutes level par. you ca n’t be the @entity2 manager without making it out of the @entity17 ’s group stage			1
@entity18 , @entity5 chairman , confirmed it			1
@entity20 will see out his contract until 2016 , at least			1
the country , staring at its worst @entity17 performance since 1994 , and its first group - stage exit since 1958 , must consider itself satisfied			1
this is as good as it gets			0
this is what we must expect			0
this is who we are now			0
the smiling idiots just happy to be at the party			0
but do n’t forget to book that cab home for 11.30pm			2
would n’t want to be out too late			2
@entity20 is n’t a turnip or a wally , but he is n’t the answer , either			1
who is ? the @entity5 do n’t know and are not interested in finding out			1
@entity18 talks blithely of winning a @entity17 in 2022 but his is an organisation devoid of ambition			1
the desire to be better , to progress , to go further , has deserted them			0
they are happy as they are			0
a new kit every year and out with @entity45			0
and that should n’t be			2
we have never looked as comfortable on the ball since			0
favourite @entity2 moment ? @entity2 4 @entity65 1			1
that night it was possible to imagine @entity2 as @entity68 champions			1
best player in your lifetime ? i am still waiting for an @entity2 player who can match pre-injury @entity74 in 1990			1
there are no guarantees from here , even with change			0
there is no outstanding candidate , no @entity83 equivalent of @entity84 or @entity85 , no popular choice as there was in the days of @entity88			1
yet that is not the point			0
we do not know what another manager would bring to the job until we offer that chance			0
we do not know whether , within @entity96 or @entity97 , or @entity98 , @entity99 , even @entity100 , is an insight or a spark that could take this team forward			0
we know what @entity20 did with it , and it was n’t bad , but it was n’t enough			1
the @entity5 has a problem , though , and it is not just in its paltry list of suitable candidates			1
it is pregnant with @entity112 — eight months gone with a mid-table club that has somehow been allowed to take over the way @entity83 football is run			1
@entity20 is the manager , @entity116 is the @entity5 ’s technical director , the friends of @entity116 are on the technical staff			1
what should always be a two - term cycle , at most , has been allowed to grow into a philosophical overhaul that makes regime change at the top even more daunting			0
those at the head of club @entity2 were looking for a quiet life after @entity127 and that is what @entity20 affords			1
they will claim to be nobly resisting a knee - jerk reaction now , yet there is nothing hasty or thoughtless in seeking a better way			0
the fall guy : @entity136 failed to get @entity2 out of the group at @entity138 and did not qualify for the @entity17 two years later water joke : @entity140 winces under his umbrella as @entity2 collapsed against @entity142 costly : @entity127 was paid £ 6million - a - year yet could not transform @entity2 's fortunes one day , the @entity5 will alight on a manager who can bring more from a group of @entity2 players than is expected , just as @entity96 exceeded expectations at @entity149 last season or @entity151 did at @entity152			1
appointing @entity153 was regarded as an exercise in futility at @entity156 , but it proved a stroke of genius			0
if anything , it is more negligent not to try , to simply presume that this is the way it has to be , with @entity2 unable to defeat an @entity164 side beaten by @entity165 or deal with a half - fit @entity55			1
@entity20 has not done a poor job , but results here have been below what was anticipated of the much - ballyhooed ‘ best prepared team at the @entity17 ’			1
there is no shame , no dishonour			0
step aside , let someone else have a go , see where they can take it			0
the small margins are up for discussion			0
losing two games by the odd goal in three suggests @entity2 are nearly a good team			1
yet if @entity20 had the key to that final leap of improvement , where was it in @entity185 ? might another coach improve it ? we will never know until we try			2
expectations can not be managed any lower			0
@entity189 , the @entity5 general secretary , said that @entity20 had done enough to see out his contract just by getting to the @entity17 , but such meek , uncomplaining support is part of the problem			1
if there was a moment @entity2 were set on this dismal course , it was @entity18 ’s cut - throat gesture when the draw was made			1
light - hearted it may have been , but it suggested that little would be presumed of @entity2 here , and chimed with the mistaken belief that @entity20 had already negotiated a tough qualifying group , seeing off the might of @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205			1
perhaps it was this complacency that underscored the decision to leave @entity208 in international retirement , when it was plain bigger challenges awaited in @entity185			0
the sight of @entity2 clinging on for dear life in @entity204 and @entity205 and at home to @entity203 should have rung alarm bells ; instead we were told these were good draws that showed @entity2 ’s defence could handle the pressure			1
it proved a significant misjudgment , like the exclusion of @entity222			0
dead in the water ? @entity18 appeared not to fancy @entity2 's chances in @entity185 at the @entity17 draw signs of decline : @entity2 were fortunate to leave @entity228 with a point against @entity203 when @entity232 showed signs of weakness against @entity235 , if @entity222 had been named in the squad a change could have been made			1
instead , all @entity20 had to play with was the untried @entity236			2
without doubt , @entity2 ’s starting xi could have been stronger			1
much is made of the absence of @entity240 at champions @entity241 , but the strongest attacking team last season were @entity56 , and the strongest defence was at @entity245 , and both elements had an @entity83 core			2
to put them together would then require the addition of four players : a goalkeeper , a right back , a wide midfielder and a second forward			0
it is a better base on which to build than many @entity2 managers have had			2
@entity20 deserves credit for introducing @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 , but it is not as if these selections were from left field			2
without doubt @entity260 and @entity259 are among the best 20 footballers in @entity2 today and @entity258 inside the top 10			2
a new manager would not discard these figures or return @entity83 football to some dark age			1
with very few exceptions , all @entity83 coaches at @entity273 level are trying to play in a sophisticated way			2
@entity96 was captain of a brilliant @entity277 side , and took @entity149 to their first @entity228 final playing a very open game			0
at their best , @entity97 ’s @entity280 have played some lovely stuff , as did @entity283 under @entity284			0
one imagines @entity98 would n’t be a long - ball merchant , either , or @entity287 ’s @entity100 beside him			2
it is not as if @entity20 ’s methods are particularly radical			1
others would carry them on , and pick many of the same players			0
they might , however , locate the 10 per cent improvement that @entity20 could not			2
@entity2 ’s management cycle is out of whack at the moment and has been since @entity140 was dismissed			1
the @entity17 is used to prepare for the @entity297			2
it should be the other way around			0
if @entity20 sees out his deal in 2016 , his successor will get his first tournament in @entity304 in 2018			2
and the next two years are largely meaningless anyway			0
young guns : both @entity258 ( left ) and @entity260 are exciting footballers with the talent to shine in an @entity2 shirt learning the ropes : @entity98 consoles @entity310 after the defeat to @entity312 the qualifying campaign for 2016 is a tap - in			2
third place in a group comprising @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 and @entity321 might be enough			0
if @entity2 can not make it through given those circumstances there is not a manager alive that can help them			1
what it means , though , is that the next time @entity20 will truly be tested is at the @entity297 finals in @entity330			2
and what if it brings more of the same ? what if two years on , @entity2 are still little more than youthful and lively ? what if they are still beset by nerves at crucial moments , vulnerable at the back and prone to wastefulness in front of goal ? what if @entity20 is still hunting that missing piece ? another tournament passes by			1
for whatever reason , some managers influence			0
@entity346 looks a better defender with @entity208 , but he also looks a better player for @entity245 , too , even when @entity208 is not by his side			0
so @entity84 gets more from him			2
when @entity351 goalkeeper @entity350 punted that goal - kick forward and @entity54 rose to head it , @entity55 gambled on the five per cent chance his @entity56 team - mate might not connect properly and began his run			0
@entity346 was not alive to it			0
for @entity245 , for whatever reason , he would have been			0
for another @entity2 manager ? maybe			1
either way , we ’ll never know .			0

you ca n’t be the @entity2 manager without making it out of the @entity17 ’s group stage . except now you can
@entity20 is n’t a turnip or a wally , but he is n’t the answer , either . who is ?
the @entity5 do n’t know and are not interested in finding out .
there is no outstanding candidate , no @entity83 equivalent of @entity84 or @entity85 , no popular choice as there was with @entity88
