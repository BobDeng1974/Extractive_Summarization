by @entity0 published : 07:01 est , 12 january 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 12 january 2013 the @entity1 ' set up a court ' where they investigated an accusation from one of their members that another member had raped them			1
the far - left party heard that instead of reporting the grave accusation to police , a disputes committee heard ' evidence ' from both the accused and the accuser , before a panel exonerated the man - known as ' comrade @entity14 ' - for the alleged rape			1
the minutes of the meeting have been revealed after furious members of the party leaked details to a @entity21 member blogger , who posted the full account online			1
the @entity25 held their own committee meeting to discuss the grave allegations party members exonerated comrade @entity14 , who had been accused of raping a female ' comrade ' revealing details show that one member said the ' party had no faith in the bourgeois court system to deliver justice ' , the @entity37 reported , and the party held its own investigation			1
the proceeding bears similarities to @entity43 courts , which traditionally do not rely on lawyers ; plaintiffs and defendants represent themselves , there no pre-trial discovery process , and there is meant to be no cross-examination of witnesses			0
@entity53 , who runs the @entity55 blog which published the meeting 's minutes , likened the proceedings to a ' sharia - style court ' , the newspaper reported			1
minutes show that the party 's dispute committee - which hands out disciplinary action if it deems it appropriate - clear comrade @entity14 after hearing evidence from him and his alleged victim , a female member only identified as ' w '			1
the unnamed member claimed she was assaulted over a six - month period between 2008 , and 2009 , but did not want to go to the police - preferring the party to deal with her complaint			1
but six of the seven members of the panel found in favour of comrade @entity14 , the @entity37 reported , and cleared him of her accusations			2
however , when the committee 's findings were shared with the party at a december conference , many members were clearly unhappy with the results			2
one member reportedly said that the @entity1 did not have faith in the court system to bring justice the panel 's decision was only narrowly accepted by 213 votes to 209 in a vote			1
one of the dispute committee 's members told the conference : ' we 're not a law court			2
' we are here to protect the interests of the party , and to make sure that any inappropriate behaviour of any kind by comrades is dealt with , and we do that according to the politics of a revolutionary party			2
' the member claimed the panel had tried to support the complainant because : ' we know how the courts and the police make women , you know , try to blame women , how few rapes are reported and how few of them are successfully prosecuted			1
' the woman was allegedly not allowed to attend the meeting where the details were announced to the party			2
but one of her friends spoke on her behalf to the party			2
the woman said : ' the complainant is this case frequently asked to come to this session , so she could be aware of what ’s being said about her , because it is her case after all			0
' she was prepared to speak out so that people could hear about her experiences and learn from what ’s happened here , so that it would n’t happen again			0
but she was denied that right by the @entity130			0
' the friend said that the complainant was unhappy with how her accusation had been handled			0
she said : ' she thought that if she put a complaint to the party that it would be dealt with in line with the party ’s politics and our proud tradition on women ’s liberation			0
sadly her experience was quite the opposite			0
' she feels that she was questioned in quite a reactionary way , and was made to answer questions on the spot as if she was the one on trial			0
' she felt she was being interrogated and felt they were trying to catch her out in order to make her out to be a liar			0
' she did not accept the line of questioning , saying " they think i 'm a s * * * who asked for it "			0
' after the details were heard , a prominent member of the party - @entity1 journalist @entity157 - resigned , the @entity37 reported			1
the @entity159 were unavailable to comment			0
the @entity1 describes itself as a revolutionary party , committed to socialism , internationalism and against racism , imperialism and oppression			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
