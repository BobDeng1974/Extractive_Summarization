by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 7 october 2012 updated : 11:58 est , 7 october 2012 an image of the genius who took physics to new heights is eerily manifested on the side of an @entity8 mountain in this incredible image			1
the face , which appears on the side of @entity12 in @entity13 , has an uncanny resemblance to @entity15 , the @entity16 - born physicist famous for developing the general theory of relativity and forever changing our understanding of the universe			1
anyone viewing the mountain might expect to see nothing more than snowy slopes			2
however , a closer look shows what is actually there - an incredibly accurate profile of @entity15 's famous face			1
relative - ly similar : @entity30 , in @entity13 , @entity8 , bears a striking resemblance to genius @entity15 ironically , @entity15 , who is also famous for the theory of @entity34 , @entity35 and his work on the @entity38 project which led to @entity39 developing the atom bomb , was a citizen of @entity8 from 1911 - 1912			1
in 1921 he won the @entity41 for physics and was so famous that in the period before @entity44 he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain the theory of relativity			0
his ingenious way of handling it was to apologise and explain that he just happened to look like the great man			0
he died in @entity52 , @entity53 in 1955 at the age of 76			0
soaring intellect : here we see the uncannily similar peak set against an azure sky the mountain is similar to @entity60 , a sculpture carved into the granite face of @entity60 near @entity63 , @entity64 , in the @entity39			2
sculpted by @entity66 @entity65 and his son , @entity67 , @entity60 features 60 - foot sculptures of the heads of former @entity39 presidents @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 .			0
