this is @entity1 , the secret desert hq of the @entity3 and the controversial @entity5 group , reportedly central to @entity7 ’s marital split from @entity8			1
ominously for those inside , the razor - sharp fences surrounding the 700 - acre compound of @entity1 have spikes pointing in both directions			1
with motion sensors along the perimeter and a camouflaged sniper bunker hidden in the hillside above , it is unclear whether the prison - style security is to keep people out or to keep them in — or both			0
the base , surrounded by hills near the town of @entity25 in southern @entity26 , was for decades a secret even to most @entity28			1
but now it has been thrust into the spotlight amid claims that @entity7 ended her six - year - marriage to the @entity34 star over fears that he wanted to send their daughter @entity36 to join @entity5			1
although @entity36 is only six and @entity5 usually recruits young people over 16 , @entity8 — yesterday named the highest - paid @entity39 star after earning £ 47 million last year — holds enormous sway in the church and would have no problem pulling strings			1
but @entity5 ’s dire reputation is enough to give any mother palpitations			2
its members wear naval uniforms , use military ranks and are expected to salute to senior church members like @entity8 and call them ‘ sir ’			2
outraged former members say that conditions are anything but fraternal and have painted @entity5 — which stands for @entity5 , a reference to the church ’s early days sailing the globe on ships — as slavery by another name			2
some 800 of the 6,000 @entity5 members are at @entity1 at any given time , but all of them can expect to spend some of their toughest years in the church there			1
formerly a resort popular with the @entity39 industry and known by the unfortunate title of @entity68 after an old @entity70 tribal battle , @entity1 was bought by the church in 1978			2
it has since spent at least £ 30 million redeveloping it			0
enclave : @entity1 , the @entity3 camp on a 500 - acre compound at @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity26 all aboard : the masts of a ship - like structure next to a swimming pool at the isolated @entity1 compound in the @entity26 wilderness headquarters : the @entity3 base in @entity26 has a church , mansion , golf course accommodation and swimming pool spiritual home : the $ 9.4million mansion which former members claim was built for the return of @entity93 who died in 1986 the site boasts comfortable villas where the group ’s authoritarian leader @entity97 and other senior scientologists live and work , a castle - style film studio that produces propaganda , a huge church , a ship - themed swimming pool , a golf course and the mansion of the late @entity3 founder , @entity93			1
the latter , the grand house at the top of the compound called @entity112 , is now a museum but is reportedly kept fully staffed and furnished			0
@entity28 believe in reincarnation , and hope @entity93 may some day return			0
@entity117 members claim they were continually forced to work 20 - hour days for just room , board and a weekly allowance of £ 15			0
physical relationships , marriage and especially childbirth are said to be discouraged as they are seen as a distraction from @entity5 ’s arduous work running the @entity3 organisation			2
recruits sign billion - year contracts because — as @entity28 believe in reincarnation — they are expected to return to @entity5 in future lives			1
when they have tried to leave , some @entity131 — as members are called — have said the church has given them a bill for tens of thousands of dollars for the teaching and training they received while serving in @entity5			0
keeping watch : the @entity1 compound has razor - tipped fences , motion sensors and what appears to be a heavily camouflaged sniper - style nest bunker that over looks the entire property ( pictured ) devout : the religious technology center at the gated compound which sits in arid foothills , 90 miles from @entity149 battle : @entity7 has filed for divorce from husband @entity8 and has asked for sole custody of @entity36			1
the actress reportedly dislikes and distrusts scientology to which her husband is devoted church leaders at @entity1 are allegedly encouraged to instil aggressive , even violent discipline on the compound both with @entity5 foot soldiers and other visiting church members			1
those who fail to submit are reportedly punished in ‘ the @entity161 ’ , a pair of extra-wide mobile homes on @entity1 used as a prison block for @entity28 who have in some way offended their leaders			1
although the church denies the existence of such a place and some believe the buildings have been removed , a string of former @entity28 have come forward to detail the abuse they allege went on there			0
@entity175 , once the second most powerful figure in the church — but who later fell out with the organisation and fled from the base — told a court that between 80 and 100 @entity28 were sentenced to the hole at a time and were required to do group confessions all day and all night			2
he claimed that , one night , @entity97 visited the @entity161 and organised a brutal game of musical chairs			0
putting the @entity187 song @entity188 on the sound system , he announced that only the winner would be allowed to remain a member of the church , prompting a desperate fight as @entity28 came to blows over the chairs			0
the church has denied all allegations , saying that @entity175 was ‘ delusional ’			0
earlier this year , another high - profile @entity199 defector , @entity198 , tearfully told a court how in 2007 she and fellow ‘ @entity202 ’ at @entity1 — including church management from as far afield as @entity204 and @entity205 — were forced to share a single conference room with cubicles and office spaces around it			2
faithful : an aerial shot shows members at @entity213 - where it has been claimed that members are paid just $ 50 a week and tracked down if they try to leave rough terrain : members are allegedly banned from leaving the isolated base , according to former members fun and games ? leisure facilities on the compound include basketball courts residents also have access to a sprawling and well - kept golf course , that 's part of the @entity1 compound there were bars on the windows and the only exit was guarded 24 hours a day by church security men , she said			1
meals were a ‘ slop ’ of reheated leftovers , such as beans and rice , barely providing enough energy for the days ’ main activity — hurling abuse at each other in often violent confessionals designed to get them to admit ill - feeling towards @entity97			0
she described her own 12 - hour ordeal as she was forced to stand in a large rubbish bin while the 100 other inmates poured water over her and screamed in her face that she was a lesbian			0
‘ you ate there , you slept there on the floor and you never left with the exception of a brief period to go take a shower , ’ she said , adding that the place was infested with ants			0
at one point , @entity97 is said to have piled on the discomfort by turning off the electricity — and therefore the air - conditioning — for two weeks , making the temperature inside the @entity161 soar to @entity266 ( @entity267 )			0
rank - and - file @entity5 members toiling away at @entity1 are similarly vulnerable to abuse , some of them claim			1
@entity272 , who spent 15 years in @entity5 , recounted how under - performers at @entity1 were frequently sent to work - camps , where they would be humiliated			1
he recounted how he and many others once had to spend several days in the blistering desert heat chipping out several feet of solidified waste from a dried - out sewage lake			0
they were allowed only hand tools and given neither masks nor eye protection			0
devotion : the church at the @entity3 compound in @entity26 wilderness : @entity5 is run from @entity1 in @entity289 , @entity290 the road less traveled : the strict community of @entity28 have installed tight security at the base			1

700 - acre compound 90 miles from @entity149 is hq of @entity5
centre , *dubbed* @entity1 , was kept a secret to even @entity28 for decades
it 's claimed @entity8 planned to send @entity36 to @entity5
organisation is being *investigated* by @entity305 over human *trafficking*
