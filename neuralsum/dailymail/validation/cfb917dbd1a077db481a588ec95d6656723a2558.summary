@entity0 and her two older children , @entity2 , 11 , and @entity3 , 9 , were in the gallery just beside me for @entity6 – and they chose a belter			1
' there 's going to be quite a lot of shouting , ' i heard mrs @entity0 warn the youngsters as the @entity11 assembled below us			2
this was the last @entity6 of the @entity15			2
for either @entity17 or @entity18 , this was possibly the last hurrah at the despatch box			0
as the prime minister took his seat he looked up and spotted his children			1
an enormous beam lit his face and he winked at them			0
but as he read his usual opening spiel about having ' further such meetings today ' he shot the speaker a rueful little smile , plainly acknowledging that the precious formula of words – used by premiers for decades – might never again fall from his lips			0
magimix time ! mr @entity36 had seemed sure he had the zinger par excellence with which to undo his great rival			1
the @entity51 leader stood at the @entity52 , feet planted wide , a superior twitch on his lips as he leaned into the microphone			1
after a drollery about mr @entity37 's ' retirement plans ' ( that tv interview which has so excited the @entity20 's more crosspatch critics ) , @entity55 ' challenged the pm to give a straight answer to a straight question			1
' will he now rule out a rise in @entity63 ? ' asked mr @entity36			1
mr @entity37 : ' yes			1
' oops ! that was n't meant to happen			0
mr @entity36 had been expecting the pm to give a waffling non-answer			1
all his poise had been predicated on that			0
the eyebrow had been raised in a doubting manner as he put the query			0
his tone had been sarcastic			0
he knew – just knew – that @entity37 would not be able to give a straight answer			2
instead , the low swine had coughed up a horribly direct , undeniable , comprehensible ' yes '			0
not fair , ref ! the @entity36 team had spent hours finessing follow - up attack lines			2
they had envisaged accusing the @entity79 of failing to be clear about their vat plans			2
now the so - and - so @entity37 had gone and ruled out any such rise			1
you ca n't rely on them to do anything			0
from my perch i could not see mr @entity36 's eyes but a colleague who was watching him reports that they revolved like a couple of fruit - machine dials whose lever had just been given a mighty yank			1
his cheeks were sucked in , as were the curtains in @entity98 's bedroom as the tornado strikes in @entity100 of @entity101 the whole @entity11 was taken by similar surprise			0
there was an initial silence , as perhaps happens immediately after a bomb blast before car alarms start to ring			0
had one of @entity51 's main themes for the general election just been obliterated ? it did look horribly like that			2
labour mps sat stony - faced as @entity113 @entity112 roared with laughter when mr @entity37 ruled out a vat increase @entity117 , er , er , er : the @entity36 mainframe went into catastrophic systems freeze			1
he sounded as though he had just swallowed a @entity120 whole			0
' let me say to him , let me say to him , let me say to him , ' he jibbered , gulping for air			0
then , with desperation : ' nobody 's gon na believe him ! nobody 's gon na believe him ! ' this drew laughter from the @entity129 benches , aghast silence from @entity51			1
@entity131 , @entity51 election supremo , was sitting beside mr @entity36			1
she was doing one of those tombstone grins they do in the @entity135 cartoons before all the teeth drop out			0
mr @entity37 capitalised on the ambush ( which , one hears , may have been arranged with @entity138 )			1
he pounced on @entity51 confusion and asked mr @entity36 if he would reciprocate by ruling out a @entity51 tax rise on national insurance			1
after all , @entity142 is meant to be about questions to the prime minister , not from him			1
speaker @entity145 let it pass and mr @entity36 flailed			1
he offered no such promise on national insurance , allowing mr @entity37 to clinch the moment by accusing @entity51 of a ' jobs tax bombshell '			1
only later in the afternoon did a somewhat panicked @entity51 high command deny that it will hike national insurance tax			2
by then the moment had largely passed			0
mr @entity37 appeared to be enjoying his time at the @entity155 , with wife @entity0 and children @entity2 and @entity3 looking on from the public gallery the @entity129 benches were in loud , rampant tumult			1
sir @entity160 ( @entity161 , @entity162 ) hoiked up his trouser legs to betray two horrendously yellow socks ( he had a yellow waistcoat , too )			0
@entity166 ( con , @entity167 ) waved a large , florid mouchoir			0
beside me , young @entity2 and @entity3 grinned enormously and @entity2 clenched her fist , punching the air with a ' yes ! '			0
she is like this aged 11 ? crumbs			0
by 30 she 'll probably be running a multinational			0
behind the @entity37 family party sat another notable visitor : @entity176 , cricket commentator and @entity177			2
@entity176 kept his counsel but if he had been offering commentary box analysis of the session one fears he might have talked of @entity36 's stoomps bein ' uprooted			2
this was a comprehensive clattering of a disorientated , dazed @entity36			2
it was a high - velocity whizzing which left the @entity51 leader a sorry , smoothiefied splodge on the floor			1

@entity0 and her two older children watched on during @entity6
they proceeded to see their *father* , the prime minister , trap @entity36
the @entity51 leader was left flustered after mr @entity37 ruled out a vat rise
his *floundering* *reaction* caused laughter among the @entity113 *backbenches*
