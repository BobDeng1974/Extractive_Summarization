by @entity0 published : 03:34 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 04:12 est , 13 december 2013 it may seem unlikely as the annual @entity3 spending spree gets under way , but a survey has found the @entity6 are among the least materialistic in the world			1
out of 20 countries , people in the @entity6 were ranked third least concerned with material things , whereas @entity11 was top , followed by @entity12 and @entity13			1
more than 16,000 people including 1,000 in the @entity6 , were asked whether they agreed with the sentence : ‘ i measure my success by the things i own ’			2
least materialistic ? a study found the @entity6 is one of the least concerned nations regarding material things			1
londoners , pictured here , are said to believe money is not everything only 16 per cent of @entity6 respondents said yes - with only @entity28 , at 15 per cent , and @entity29 , at 7 per cent , coming lower			1
meanwhile , 71 per cent of @entity11 and 58 per cent of @entity12 people polled said they measured their status by what they owned			1
people in @entity6 were also far less materialistic than those in @entity36 , where 34 per cent of people agreed , @entity38 , which had a score of 32 per cent , or even @entity41 , where 27 per cent of people thought money equalled success			2
the question was asked as part of @entity47			0
in other answers , the proportion of the @entity6 public who feel under a lot of pressure to be successful and make money has risen significantly during the recession , from 27 per cent in 2008 to 39 per cent in 2013			2
frenzy : but it seems that did n't stop shoppers in @entity59 battling for cut price electrical bargains at an @entity62 store in @entity63 last month			0
the shelves were cleared within a minute and a man brawling was arrested the global phenomenon is far more prominent in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , according to the @entity47 survey manic : there were reports of fights breaking out in stores across @entity73 , including this in @entity74 this year this still places @entity6 slightly below the 46 per cent global average			1
we feel under less pressure than those in emerging markets and @entity73 , but under more pressure than some of our @entity84 neighbours , including the @entity85 and the @entity36			0
@entity86 , managing director of @entity47 ’s @entity87 , said : ‘ as the country emerges from recession , the @entity6 public ’s concern about the national economy has fallen			1
but worries about our personal finances persist , and we are feeling under more pressure to make money			0
‘ yet we do not like to see ourselves as measuring success by the things we own , perhaps because we have more possessions to begin with			0
' it is certainly the case that a materialistic outlook is much more common in emerging markets			0
unnecessary : although @entity107 's @entity106 branch is seen here preparing for @entity108 and cyber monday this year , the survey showed @entity6 largely believe money is n't everything ' and the fact that most @entity6 remain optimistic about their own lives suggests that we may actually believe that money is n’t everything			1
’ people remain relatively pessimistic about @entity6 over the next year - with just 25 per cent saying they were optimistic			0
however , 61 per cent of @entity6 were optimistic about themselves and their families over the next 12 months , in line with the global average of 59 per cent			0
optimism about the country ’s prospects is highest in @entity12 at 53 per cent , @entity122 ( 47 per cent ) and @entity123 ( 47 per cent ) , while @entity28 ( 12 per cent ) , @entity85 ( ten per cent ) and @entity36 ( nine per cent ) were the least optimistic			2
the same three @entity84 countries were in the bottom five on personal optimism , with @entity126 ( 40 per cent ) and @entity127 ( 39 per cent ) even lower .			0

@entity47 said @entity6 third least worried about shopping after @entity28 and @entity29
