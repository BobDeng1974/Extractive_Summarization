by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 27 june 2012 updated : 19:25 est , 27 june 2012 revolt : @entity3 's plans to reform the @entity4 are being threatened by a group of @entity7 backbenchers rebel conservative @entity8 are threatening the biggest revolt in the party ’s history over @entity3 ’s plans to replace the @entity4 with a mainly elected second chamber			1
a group of about 100 backbenchers , nicknaming themselves ‘ @entity16 ’ , are vowing to vote down the proposals , warning they will not hand the @entity18 the balance of power in a reformed upper house in perpetuity			1
@entity23 sources concede they are expecting ‘ blood on the walls , floor and ceiling ’ over legislation which threatens to put @entity30 relations under unprecedented strain			2
several parliamentary private secretaries , the most junior members of the government , are considering resigning rather than voting in favour			2
@entity36 insisted yesterday it was ‘ time to make progress ’ over bringing democracy to @entity40 ’s second chamber			1
the government published plans for an 80 per cent elected upper house , with membership cut from 800 to 450			1
elections will be held alongside general elections to the @entity48 , with the first in 2015			2
members will be elected in tranches of 120 at each of the next three elections , with the process of change completed by 2025			1
they would serve a single 15 - year term , and represent large , multi-member regional constituencies			2
crucially for the @entity18 , they will be elected using a form of proportional representation , which all but guarantees no party could ever hope for a majority , meaning their influence will always be critical			1
even after it is reformed , the chamber will continue to be known as the @entity4 – though its members will not be able to call themselves ‘ lord ’			1
after suggestions they would be called senators , @entity72 ( @entity73 ) or @entity50 of the @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , lord @entity67 , the @entity68 said : ‘ we are not calling them senators at the moment – we are not actually calling them anything			0
’ mr @entity36 told @entity8 : ‘ we have been discussing this issue for 100 years and it really is time to make progress			0
there are opponents of @entity84 in every party			0
but there is a majority in this @entity4 for a mainly - elected @entity4 and i believe there ’s a majority for that in the country			1
the prime minister attacked @entity95 leader @entity94 as ‘ hopeless ’ for saying he backed the reforms , but indicating @entity95 would vote against on the basis that more time should be allowed to debate the legislation			0
the @entity100 sent two ‘ big beasts ’ – foreign secretary @entity102 and justice secretary @entity103 – onto the airwaves to try to rally @entity7 support for the plans			1
however , mr @entity103 conceded there was disagreement on almost every aspect of the @entity110			0
he said : ‘ there is n’t a solid majority on almost any detail – bishops , electoral system			0
’ @entity18 leader mr @entity3 said : ‘ the coalition stands on the brink of an historic achievement			1
‘ it can not be right that ordinary , hard - working people are expected to obey laws that are created by people appointed entirely by birth or patronage , who have a generous pay packet and a job for life			0
the time for idle talk is finished			0
now is the time for action			0
’ big beasts : foreign secretary @entity102 and justice secretary @entity103 have been tasked with trying to rally @entity7 support for the plans but @entity7 mp @entity135 , parliamentary private secretary to @entity137 secretary @entity136 , said he would join the @entity7 revolt even if he had to resign			2
@entity7 mp @entity139 added : ‘ i did n’t get elected as a @entity7 mp to throw @entity140 out of the @entity142 parliament			2
’ fellow conservative @entity143 said the plans would mean that in @entity146 , every voter would have six elected politicians : their councillor , a local member of the @entity150 , a list member of the @entity150 , an mp , an @entity152 and a senator			1
he said the @entity110 was a ‘ total nonsense ’ and he would ‘ absolutely without any question ’ vote against it			0
sources close to the prime minister , who used to refer to @entity84 disparagingly as a ‘ third term issue ’ denied conservative mps were being given ‘ a nod and a wink ’ that they could rebel over @entity84 without suffering consequences			0
but one senior mp said when he told a party whip in charge of discipline that he intended to vote against , he was told : ‘ good			0
