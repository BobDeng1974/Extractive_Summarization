drinkers should have three alcohol - free days a week if they want to avoid the risk of liver disease , warn @entity5 ’s most eminent doctors			1
current official guidance on healthy drinking limits is ‘ extremely dangerous ’ and must be rewritten – because it implies that drinking every day is fine , the @entity6 said			1
government advice states men should drink no more than four units a day and women no more than three			0
new guidelines : leading doctors now say drinkers should have at least three alcohol - free days a week but this must also address the risks of daily drinking , doctors insisted			2
they told mps the risk of liver disease , alcohol dependence and serious illness increases if people drink every day rather than taking time off			1
they also urged ministers to consider imposing stricter guidelines on pensioners – perhaps as little as seven units a week for older women and 11 for older men			2
one unit is the equivalent of one small glass of wine ( 125ml ) or half a pint of lager			0
limits : government advice states men should drink no more than four units per day and women no more than three older people ’s bodies are more affected by regular drinking , which puts them at risk of dementia , depression and falls , they said			1
yet pensioners are currently given the same guidelines as all adults			0
in their submission to mps on the @entity59 , the doctors said : ‘ government guidelines should recognise that hazardous drinking has two components : frequency of drinking and amount of drinking			0
‘ to ignore either of these components is scientifically unjustified			0
‘ a simple addition would remedy this – namely a recommendation that to remain within safe limits people have three alcohol - free days a week			0
’ they added : ‘ the implied sanctioning of a pattern of regular daily drinking is potentially extremely dangerous			0
the @entity6 disputes the claim that drinking every day will not accrue a significant health risk			2
‘ frequency is an important risk factor for development of alcohol dependency and alcoholic liver disease			1
’ more than 16,000 people die from liver disease , usually caused by excessive drinking , every year in the @entity5			1
it is @entity5 ’s fifth biggest killer and the only major cause of death increasing year - on - year			1
twice as many people die of it now than in 1991 and rates have soared by 13 per cent since 2005			1
the @entity95 says liver disease is the biggest cause of premature death for women , and the second only to heart attacks for men			1
the first drinking guidelines in 1987 – which were written by the @entity6 – stated that men should drink no more than 21 units a week and women no more than 14			2
on top of this , everyone should take two or three days off a week			0
doctors are angry that reforms to the advice in 1995 dropped this reference to alcohol - free days			0
‘ this in effect appeared to sanction daily or near - daily drinking , one of the key risk factors for alcohol - related harm and dependency , ’ they said			0
‘ if the daily limit of four units was drunk with no drink - free days , this would be the equivalent of 28 units per week ; a 30 per cent increase on the @entity6 ’s guidelines			2
’ @entity126 : young regular drinkers are particularly at risk of developing liver disease later in life the paper added : ‘ further studies have shown an increased risk of cirrhosis for those who drink daily or near - daily compared to those who drink periodically or intermittently			1
’ young regular drinkers were particularly at risk , it said			1
a 2009 study showed increases in @entity5 liver deaths ‘ are the result of daily or near - daily heavy drinking , not episodic or binge drinking			2
this regular drinking pattern is discernable at an early age ’ , the paper said			0
government experts expect the cost of treating people with liver disease will soar by 50 per cent in four years to more than £ 2billion			1
middle - class women are particularly at risk of daily drinking as they often have a glass or two of wine after work , followed by more at the weekend			1
lower limits should be considered for older people , as even modest levels of alcohol consumption can have a more profound effect on their bodies ‘ due to physiological changes associated with ageing ’ , the paper said			0
‘ there is concern current guidelines are not appropriate for older people , ’ it added			1
sir @entity171 , @entity6 special adviser on alcohol , said : ‘ we recommend a safe limit of 0 - 21 units a week for men and 0 - 14 units a week for women provided the total amount is not drunk in one or two bouts and that there are two to three alcohol - free days a week			2
‘ at these levels , most individuals are unlikely to come to harm			0
’ in june , a @entity187 report called for a limit of 11 units a week for men aged over 65 and seven for women of this age			0
the @entity6 quoted these suggested limits but did not explicitly endorse them .			0

more than 16,000 people die from liver disease every year in the @entity5
young regular drinkers and middle - class women particularly at risk
@entity6 say current guidelines must be rewritten
