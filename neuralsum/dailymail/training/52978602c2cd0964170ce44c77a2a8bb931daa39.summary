@entity0 are putting the finishing touches to their bid to lure @entity3 from @entity4 this month – despite @entity5 saying they are wasting their time			1
@entity7 understands @entity0 chairman @entity8 is about to test the resolve of the @entity11 club on the say - so of manager @entity12			1

@entity4 winger @entity3 applauds the travelling supports following the @entity18 2 - 0 win at @entity20 the @entity22 winger hammers a shot off the bar during @entity4 2 - 0 win at @entity26 earlier this month the 31 - year - old midfielder is in the final six months of his contract but so far negotiations over a new two - year deal have been fruitless with the sticking point believed to be the appearance - related aspect of the second year			1
but not only does @entity5 feel any approach to take the player from his clutches now will be swiftly rejected , he firmly believes a middle ground in the talks will yet be found			1
‘ he ’s not leaving in january , ’ @entity5 stated			1
‘ we have to win the league			1
‘ he ’s a good player and we want to keep the best ones			1
‘ the situation is still the same			2
we are talking together and will see if something can be agreed			2
‘ i still think it ’s a possibility because we want to keep him and he wants to stay			2
that ’s the most important thing			2
‘ if i did n’t want him and he did n’t want to stay it would be finished now			2

‘ i still think a deal can be done			0

‘ he ’s a very good players and we ’ll see if we can do this for a longer period			0
' the situation is very clear			0
we want him and he wants to stay			0
