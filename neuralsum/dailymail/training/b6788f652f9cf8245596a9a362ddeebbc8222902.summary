by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:46 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 04:50 est , 8 november 2012 first there were the pictures of debauched racegoers rolling round the paddocks after the @entity6			0
and now there is this jaw - dropping video showing a woman in a tight blue dress , fascinator and high heels so punch - drunk she ’s prepared to take on the entire crowd			1
the footage , shot at @entity15 and posted by @entity16 , features her throwing wild punches , collapsing on the floor and eventually being pinned down			0
her astonishing antics provoke a wealth of comments			0
‘ oh , she ’s terrible , ’ one woman says before a male voice advises ‘ just walk away mate , ’ to someone on the receiving end of her fist			0
five security guards eventually arrive to remove her			0
a slew of newspapers and tv shows featured the story with many appalled that the behaviour at @entity15 had attracted such bad international press			0
more than 70 racegoers were thrown out of the event after incidents involving alcohol			1
out of those , 39 were forced to leave for being intoxicated , four people were arrested for being drunk in public place and 29 were caught trying to bring alcohol into the racecourse			1
paramedics treated 23 racegoers mainly for alcohol - related problems			1
but as the drunken behaviour at the event became the focus of the international press , others were only too keen to highlight @entity74 ’s own less than salubrious record at sporting events			1
debauched scenes from recent race meetings such @entity79 and even @entity80 where a picture of a drunken thug swigging a bottle of pink champagne horrified @entity48 readers			1
crowd watches on : a clip emerged today of the female racegoer so drunk that she was flinging wild punches at anybody near her , falling over , exposing her underwear and eventually being hauled away by security going nowhere : she is pinned down by a man , while shouts of ‘ get this b * * * h out of here ’ and ‘ where 's security ? ’ are heard			2
someone shouts : ‘ calm down sweetheart ’ and another jokes : ‘ take your missus home ’ fun 's over : the woman shouts at the crowd : ' ah you dumb f * * ks ' and another person shouts : ' just another day at the races '			2
then there are cheers as five security guards arrive to take her away from the area one @entity37 newspaper accused our ‘ trashbag ’ nation of ‘ chaotic scenes ’ and being a ‘ frolicking mess ’			2
‘ back in the @entity126 , @entity80 's finest must have been choking on their foie gras and desperately pondering just how we let it come to this , ’ @entity124 wrote in @entity36 ’s @entity125 ‘ we have always done it differently @entity132			2
we 've learnt to excuse those regrettable back tattoos , white leather shoes and bum - skimming skirts			0
it 's cheap entertainment , after all			0
’ he added that @entity74 ‘ sugar - coat ’ the wimbledon tennis tournament to be about ‘ dining on wild strawberries draped in freshly whipped cream and watching the greats of the game do battle			2
’ but we ‘ fail to mention the frolicking mess that is @entity148 , where cross-eyed tennis fans purge themselves of excess liquor before rolling down the mound after yet another @entity152 fails to make the finals ’			0
he said people must step over ‘ acid - tripping hippies ’ at the @entity157 and @entity158 fans are seen ‘ chugging down pints of @entity160 and blabbering on about the @entity161 ’			1
the paper also lambasted @entity74 ’s ‘ dramatically inconsistent take on public etiquette ’ after scenes of drunkenness when an alcohol ban was launched in 2008 on the @entity166			1
in addition it wrote of ‘ a shameful wake of locals who stumbled out of stations , hitching up their dresses and doing up their flies and wobbling off into the night ’			0
meanwhile news.com.au asked the question : ‘ the @entity6 party stopped a nation , but is it the @entity74 who do n't know how to have fun ? ’ social networks were abuzz with @entity37 claiming @entity74 coverage of the race was hard on them			1
@entity186 said : ‘ bit rich of the poms to lecture us on how we handle our grog			0
’ @entity190 added : ‘ they 're only p * * * * d off because they do n't have a big day to match ours : ) whinging poms never happy unless they are whinging			0
. lol ’ commentary : the response to @entity48 's story in the @entity37 media was far from complimentary and @entity199 said : ‘ they 're only interested cos charlies here ! at least there was no nudity eh @entity203 ? ? ’ the @entity6 attracted 105,000 people yesterday , including the @entity205 and @entity206 who are on the @entity37 leg of their jubilee tour			1
a two - mile event , the race has become a social , cultural and sporting icon with attendees sporting their finest clothes			2
but in time - honoured fashion , as the champagne flowed and races were won - or lost - the racegoers became ever - more dishevelled , with some kicking off their shoes to feel the grass of the race track under their bare feet			2
@entity74 racing meets have long had a reputation for getting a bit messy as the day develops , but the hedonistic @entity36 crowds showed the @entity74 that they can party just as hard			1
some rolled around in the paddock revealing their knickers , others sipped drinks through the mouth of a giant horse head , while those who 'd got luck somewhere other than at the tote got stuck in to passionate kissing sessions			0
nonetheless , the day 's racing was deemed a resounding success , with @entity241 , vice chairman of the @entity242 ( @entity242 ) which runs the @entity6 , saying @entity243 for one declared she was ' absolutely delighted ' to be at the race course and ' could not believe ' the crowds			1
the @entity6 is one of the richest flat races in the world with a total prize money pot of around £ 4 million and attracts riders , owners and horses from across the globe			0
best ( and the wrecks ) from from the @entity6 just say neigh : one horse gets distracted by the bar good fortune : one male racegoer strikes it lucky - even if it was n't with the horses big day out : girls looking a little dishevelled after a few hours at the course cause to celebrate ? one racegoer looked in jubilant mood - perhaps having found fortune at the tote that 's rubbish ! one racegoer takes a tumble - and lands in a heap of discarded bottles and beer cans horseplay : a couple take the weight off among the debris whoops ! looks like the ground 's a little soft flat out : a race goer " planks " after the last race at @entity15 wipe out : it 's tiring work having all this fun green and pleasant land : the grass at the course was littered with empty alcohol vessels well - heeled : a race goer adjusts her shoes guess there 's no hemline rules then ! one racegoer with a very short dress enjoys a tipple at the race course jumping for joy : a couple celebrate at the @entity6 , the event seen as the highlight of the @entity301 ouch : looks like somebody fell at the first furlong pole position : one race goer celebrates with a dance spurred on by her friends fillies in their finery : girls don summery frocks and fascinators for the occasion , which was deemed a huge success by organisers should have gone @entity318 : a couple of male guest discard their blazers and demonstrate their best breakdancing moves party time ! revellers dance as a band plays music at @entity15 yesterday bright and breezy : these colourful spectators managed to keep neat and tidy - all the better to show off their vivid creations the royal couple are on a six - day visit to @entity37 to commemorate the @entity332 pop royalty @entity333 arrived in style in a fuchsia fairy - inspired dress while actress @entity338 chose to make a statement with a towering hat @entity341 enjoyed a cigarette in sunshine on the vip balcony with friends including @entity346 and @entity347 @entity37 actress @entity348 poses at the @entity349 model @entity350 wearing an intricate hairband poses with flowers @entity354 enjoyed the races with his new girlfriend @entity357 flamboyant businessman @entity358 dresses to impress chef @entity359 at the @entity6 model @entity360 at the @entity6 cricketer @entity341 at the @entity6 @entity362 ridden by jockey @entity363 heads over the line followed by @entity365 during the @entity366 @entity6 the horses come around the bend in the @entity369 during 2012 @entity6 at @entity15			1
