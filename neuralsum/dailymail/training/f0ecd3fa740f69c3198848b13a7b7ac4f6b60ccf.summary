each week @entity0 gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best @entity5 starting xi of the day			2
@entity7 slipped up to @entity8 while @entity9 were poor in their win against @entity11 , so their are several lesser - known gems in this team			1
formation : 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 @entity15 : @entity16 , @entity17 ( vs @entity18 ) , 8 @entity19 at @entity20 @entity16 was inspired in the @entity17 goal , making two brilliant second - half saves to deny @entity23 , the second shortly before @entity26 â€™s winner			1
@entity27 : @entity26 , @entity17 ( vs @entity18 ) , 7 @entity19 at @entity20 a clean sheet as part of a 10 - man team at @entity20 would have been enough for young debutant @entity26 , but he also had the audacity to score the winner			1
the youngster , who started at the heart of defence , stormed forward from right - back to net the only goal in added time			2
match winner : young debutant @entity26 scored the winner as @entity17 beat @entity18 on saturday @entity41 : @entity42 , @entity8 ( vs @entity7 ) , 7.5 @entity43 at @entity44 @entity42 was superb in defence at @entity44 , highlighted in the fact @entity7 's only goal came from a set - piece			1
the @entity49 , who signed a contract extension in the summer , looks set to have another stellar season as captain in @entity53			0
@entity41 : @entity54 , @entity55 ( vs @entity56 ) 7.5 @entity57 at @entity58 nets the winner and helps his team to a clean sheet , it ca n't get much better than that for a defender			1
@entity65 nipped in front of @entity67 for his goal as @entity70 's side got their season up and running			2
lb : @entity72 , @entity55 ( vs @entity56 ) , 8 @entity57 at @entity58 @entity72 was a constant thorn in @entity56 's side down the left - hand side for @entity55 , bombing foward from wing - back			1
the @entity78 debutant provided many crosses in the 1 - 0 win , and also cleared @entity82 's bullet header off the line			0
@entity84 : @entity85 , @entity86 ( vs @entity87 ) , 7.5 @entity88 at the @entity89 another energetic performance from @entity85 , who covered the most amount of ground ( 7.7 miles ) , but also showed fine technique for his goal			2
volleying home off the bar to put @entity86 2 - 1 up , the winger will be central to @entity99 's plans this season			0
great start : @entity85 started how he finished last season with a goal against @entity87 @entity41 : @entity104 , @entity105 ( vs @entity106 ) , 7.5 @entity107 at the @entity108 he may have scored just twice in 103 @entity5 appearances for @entity105 , but @entity104 netted the goal of the day in the 2 - 2 draw			1
five minutes had passed before the defensive midfielder 's shot from long range flew past @entity115 into the top corner			0
@entity41 : @entity117 , @entity106 ( vs @entity105 ) , 7.5 @entity107 at the @entity108 @entity117 excelled against his former club on saturday			2
constant energy in midfield gave @entity121 just the platform he was looking for			0
@entity124 's second goal with a wonderfully floated cross			0
@entity41 : @entity126 , @entity8 ( vs @entity7 ) , 8 @entity43 at @entity44 not many players can claim to be a match winner at @entity44 , but @entity126 capped a fine performance with a neat finish on saturday			1
the @entity134 midfielder , in his second spell at the @entity132 , summoned @entity135 to an humiliating opening day defeat			1
shock : @entity7 's start to the season was ruined by @entity8 playmaker @entity126 @entity140 : @entity141 , @entity11 ( vs @entity9 ) , 7.5 @entity142 at the @entity143 another man starting against his former club , the @entity144 played in an unfamiliar role on saturday			1
tasked with shutting down midfielders and stopping @entity9 finding their stride , @entity141 covered 7.2 miles at the @entity143 , second behind @entity150			0
@entity151 : @entity152 , @entity106 ( vs @entity153 ) , 8 @entity107 at the @entity108 we have an early frontrunner for the @entity156			0
@entity152 was the only man to score more than once on saturday , netting a penalty and a nice poacher 's finish			0
just a shame he was n't the match winner			0
at the double : @entity152 was the star man on saturday , netting two goals at the @entity108			0
