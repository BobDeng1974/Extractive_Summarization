the climb in @entity10 , @entity11 , was certainly not for the faint of heart , with one wrong step potentially sending them sliding nearly 100ft to almost certain death at the foot of the sheer ice sheet			1
but that did n't stop this pair of daredevils rising to the challenge			2
heartstopping : photographer @entity23 captures his partner @entity24 taking on the frozen waterfall climb in @entity10 , @entity11 @entity26 : one wrong step could have sent mr @entity24 plunging nearly 100ft down the frozen waterfall to almost certain death at its frozen base do n't look down ! after the climb mr @entity23 spoke of the intoxicating mixture of adrenaline and fear that possessed him and mr @entity24 when they first saw the ice column adventure : the frozen waterfall dangling from the @entity41 mountains , in a region nicknamed ' the @entity37 of @entity38 ' , was approximately 82ft tall adventure sport photographer @entity23 , 40 , captured these spectacular images of his partner @entity24 , 32 , taking on the ascent			1
using ice tools , ice screws , crampons and a harness , brave mr @entity23 and his climbing compatriot were able to reach the top of the waterfall in a mere twenty minutes			1
' this was the first time we were able to climb the frozen waterfall , ' said mr @entity23			1
' in the previous years , the [ ice ] never got fat enough for us to do it , or did n't reach all the way to the ground			2
' when we first saw it like this it looked scary , but looking back at photographs reminds me of the excitement we had when we first saw this free standing pillar , the adrenaline and fear of climbing it			2
' the frozen waterfall dangling from the @entity41 mountains , in a region nicknamed ' the @entity37 of @entity38 ' , was approximately 82ft tall			1
great outdoors : this photograph of the climb from another angle shows just how precarious the ascent of the waterfall was kitted out : using ice tools , ice screws , crampons and a harness , brave mr @entity23 and mr @entity24 were able to reach the top of the waterfall in a mere twenty minutes first ascent : mr @entity23 explained that in previous years the column had not been substantial enough to climb , or had not reached all the way to the ground dramatic : mr @entity24 swings his ice axe as he inches his way to the top of the waterfall , which apparently collapsed only a few weeks later talking about the climb , mr @entity23 explained : ' once we got back to the car park at the bottom of the mountain , a local told us that we had just completed the first accent of the frozen waterfall			1
' we later found out that only a few more ascents were completed after us , and several weeks later the pillar fell down ' i always loved adrenaline sports , loved to be in the mountains and be in nature			2
' i fell in love with climbing before i had even tried it ; i was hooked as soon as i brought my first climbing harness			0

one wrong step on the climb in @entity10 , @entity11 , could have sent brave climbers *plummeting* nearly 100ft
the frozen column of ice was in the @entity41 mountains in a region nicknamed the ' @entity185 '
after their ascent the locals told the two climbers they were the first to ever scale the frozen waterfall
