the @entity2 are crumbling , shocking new pictures of the 160 - year - old building reveal			2
roofs are leaking , paintwork is peeling and lifts are creaking to the point that mps have become trapped , missing key votes in the @entity9			0
a huge £ 1billion project to overhaul the entire site is needed to preserve the royal palace , with officials warning that it is has burned down once before and urgent action is needed to prevent a ‘ crisis ’			1
officials admit that there has been ‘ significant under - investment ’ since the 1940s , when the @entity9 was bombed by the @entity40			1
for years contractors have adopted a ' make do and mend ' approach to repairs , while the @entity9 and @entity45 have continued to meet			1
however , experts warn the building is deteriorating at a faster pace than repairs can be carried out during parliamentary holidays			0
dr @entity51 , programme director for the @entity52 , said : ‘ there is very little downtime and the problem is how on earth you undertake fundamental renovations on the scale required under those circumstances			1
‘ the more things become antiquated the chances of a bigger crisis grow			1
it ’s already burned down once , ’ he told @entity61			1
@entity65 , parliamentary director of estates and technical director for the programme , added : ‘ within six months of my joining i had a member stuck in a lift as a vote was underway			1
' the legislation was ultimately passed by seven votes			0
that brought home just how serious these issues are			0
’ many of the 3,00 windows will not close , iron roofs have rusted and leak , toilets regularly flood and the building is riddled with asbestos , in roof spaces , light switches , toilet systems and as a sound suppressant			2
a @entity23 spokesman said : ‘ there has been significant under - investment in the fabric of the @entity2 since at least the 1940s , when parts of the @entity2 were renovated following bomb damage during the @entity94			1
other parts of the @entity2 have not undergone appropriate renovation since it was built			0
‘ to date , all intrusive renovation work has been carried out around sittings of parliament			2
this approach has permitted only the minimum essential maintenance and piecemeal replacement of systems at highest risk of failure			2
‘ currently , the rate and speed at which work can be carried out is slower than the rate at which the building is deteriorating so the backlog of essential repairs ( and in turn the risk of system failure ) is growing over time			2
’ brick work is also crumbling , because the @entity117 from @entity118 is prone to erosion many parts of the houses of @entity23 have not been repaired since they were built , more than 160 years ago @entity122 in the grand corridors inside the building is also peeling , and in many areas has been damaged by water a report two years ago found the @entity129 structure is so stuffed with asbestos and leaky roofs that it will require billions of pounds of renovation just to keep it standing			1
it warned that @entity135 and @entity45 will have to move out of the building within the next decade to enable a massive programme of works to electrics , heating , ventilation systems , drainage and stone work			0
they concluded that the @entity144 - which contains the @entity9 and lords chambers as well as suites of committee rooms , offices and dining rooms - was so poorly - maintained that it is ‘ remarkable that it continues to function ’			1
and they warned that if nothing is done to make it safe , the @entity2 could fall victim to a catastrophic fire the like of which famously destroyed its predecessor in 1834			0
although they did not put a final cost on the work , they say it will be at least £ 1.6billion			0
officials admit that there has been ‘ significant under - investment ’ since the 1940s , when the @entity9 was bombed by the @entity40 beneath the grand corridors and ornate debating chambers , a complex web of cables and pipes has built up over decades officials admit that instead of removing outdated cables , more wires have been added , making it difficult to access them for repairs and maintenance untangling the years of ' make do and mend ' repairs has given contractors a major headache the damning report on the state of the home of @entity183 democracy was ordered by the @entity184			1
it warned : ‘ while the precise cost of rectifying these deficiencies is still unknown , investigations conducted in recent years indicate that it is already in excess of 40 per cent of the insurance reinstatement value of the @entity2			0
’ there has been no renovation to the spectacular building , rebuilt along designs by @entity196 in the 1850s , since the late 1940s , following the destruction of the @entity9 chamber by @entity201 bombs			1
the report goes on : ‘ considering the age of the @entity2 , the 60 - plus years that have passed since the partial post-war refurbishment , the long - term under - investment in the fabric and the intensive use to which the @entity2 is put , it is remarkable that it continues to function			1
‘ the signs of wear and tear , the number and frequency of relatively minor floods and mechanical breakdowns , the high cost of maintaining obsolescent equipment and the large sums that are now having to be spent on aggressive maintenance and risk reduction all provide tangible evidence of the looming crisis			2
' here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the @entity2 to prevent a ‘ looming crisis ’ : asbestos the walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the @entity2 at risk			1
@entity234 much of the building needs re-wiring , and generators do not produce enough power @entity239 many original shafts are filled with wires , and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable			0
heating many boilers date from the 1930s , pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the @entity9 chamber for months flooding faulty guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding , and the @entity257 belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration			0
walls are damp and stained			0
@entity261 @entity260 a problem throughout the @entity2 , particularly as cast - iron roofs are coming to the end of their life			0
@entity266 several pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth - century roof of @entity270 every year , while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the @entity45 chamber drainage pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected			2
fire safety out of date alarms and automatic detection systems ; little ‘ compartmentation ’ meaning fire can spread easily			2
lifts oldest lift dates from 1893 , several contain obsolete components			0
only nine compliant with building regulations .			0

officials as @entity23 becomes antiquated , chances of a crisis grow
' it ’s already burned down once ' , says restoration chief @entity51
there has been ‘ significant under - investment ’ since the 1940s
web of cables and pipes added to in ' make do and mend ' approach
part of our nation ’s most valued heritage ' will be lost forever '
