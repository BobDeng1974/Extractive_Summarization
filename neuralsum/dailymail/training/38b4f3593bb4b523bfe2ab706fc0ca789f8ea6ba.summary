legislation to allow the birth of babies with genes from three biological parents should be put on hold because it is far riskier than previously thought , scientists warn			0
@entity7 are due to vote on whether the @entity8 should become the first country to legalise controversial ‘ three parent babies ’ after @entity11 watchdog the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) gave it the go - ahead			1
advocates have compared the @entity17 technique , which involves inserting a small set of genes from a second mother , to ‘ changing a battery ’ , saying it had no real impact on the baby ’s core dna			1
advocates claim the @entity17 technique , which involves inserting a small set of genes from a second mother , to ‘ changing a battery ’ , saying it had no real impact on the baby ’s core dna ( file photo ) but a growing number of scientists and mps say new research indicates that such children ’s genetic make - up could be affected far more profoundly than had been realised and they may develop unpredictable physical and mental character traits			1
they say that tests on animals have fuelled fears that people born using this technique – called mitochondrial dna transfer – could also face problems such as reduced fertility , shorter lives , learning difficulties and cancer			0
even the respected @entity54 , which had backed the technique , last month called for more research , saying : ‘ it appears we may have seriously underestimated the influence that mitochondria have			1
research suggests they play a key role in some of the most important features of human life			0
‘ this raises the ethically troubling prospect – once widely dismissed – that children conceived in this way will inherit vital traits from three parents			0
’ the @entity17 technique involves taking the nucleus out of the egg of a mother likely to be carrying faulty mitochondria – the ‘ batteries ’ that power cells – transferring it into a healthy egg donated by another woman , resulting in a baby free from a range of devastating mitochondrial diseases			1
but it means the baby would contain genetic material not only from his or her mother and father but also from the donor			0
mitochondria may have their own genes which would interact with matching @entity48 in the nucleus of the cell that could have a much larger impact on a child than has been believed			2
the @entity17 technique involves taking the nucleus out of the egg of a mother likely to be carrying faulty mitochondria – the ‘ batteries ’ that power cells – transferring it into a healthy egg donated by another woman dr @entity96 , senior research fellow in evolution , behaviour and development at @entity100 , said the latest discoveries were ‘ really important ’ , adding there was now ‘ plenty of data suggesting we need to be more concerned than the authorities seem to be ’			1
@entity107 , professor of cell biology and anatomy at @entity110 , said the proposed procedures would pair up different genes in an ‘ arbitrary fashion ’			2
he said : ‘ an analogy would be the engines of a @entity116 and a @entity117			0
each car needs an engine , and the engine does the same thing in both cars			0
but things would go very wrong if you simply swapped them between the two cars			0
it is difficult to anticipate what developmental or physiological malfunctions would result from a mismatch			0
’ @entity132 mp @entity131 said the new research illustrated how ‘ ill - prepared we are to interfere with the genetic make - up of human beings			2
‘ the rush towards legalising genetically modified babies must be halted in light of these new findings			2
’ but proponents of the @entity17 treatment said the benefits were huge and denied they were involved in ‘ @entity144 ’			1
prof @entity145 , of the @entity146 at @entity147 , said : ‘ the risks are small compared to the risks those families face of having children with serious mitochondrial diseases			0
’ the @entity12 , which ruled in july that the technique was ‘ not unsafe ’ and which will regulate the technique , said its expert panel has reviewed more research into the area ‘ than any other body or group of scientists in the world ’			1
it said many of the issues being raised had been considered and it can ‘ see no reason for changing its in - depth views on this matter at this time ’ .			1
