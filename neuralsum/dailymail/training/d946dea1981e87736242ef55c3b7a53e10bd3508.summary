by @entity0 published : 16:44 est , 14 april 2013 updated : 02:16 est , 15 april 2013 @entity2 heavyweights have piled further pressure on @entity4 to clarify his policies and stop protesting about everything the government does			1
three former cabinet ministers – @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 – yesterday urged the @entity2 leader to follow @entity14 ’s advice and offer a positive alternative for voters rather than simply criticising the status quo			1
lord @entity9 , who held nine @entity19 posts , said @entity2 will not be ready for government until it spells out policies on key issues			2
policies : @entity4 has tried to downplay @entity14 's assertion that @entity2 has become a ‘ repository for people ’s anger ’ ‘ i think what [ mr @entity4 ] now has to do is to set out the direction of future @entity2 government on questions like welfare , on the economy , on housing and so on , ’ he said			1
‘ the important thing is to recognise that , as you move from the politics of opposition to the politics of a potential government , that you have to be offering solutions and not just criticising the status quo			0
’ lord @entity9 also dismissed the view of mr @entity4 and his guru @entity44 that the political centre ground is shifting to the @entity46			1
mr @entity14 last week wrote a lengthy critique of the direction mr @entity4 has taken the party , warning that @entity2 has become a ‘ repository for people ’s anger ’			1
but mr @entity4 dismissed the concerns saying his ‘ @entity2 ’ wants to look to the future not the past			2
in an article yesterday @entity10 said mr @entity14 and others were trying to provoke debate about the party ’s future			1
in a @entity61 interview the former home secretary said @entity2 would be ‘ literally going nowhere ’ if senior members could not voice their views			0
mr @entity10 said : ‘ we ’ve got to have the confidence to be able to say where we ’re going , not just a narrative about what the government is doing			2
’ he added : ‘ @entity2 can not and should never be simply the avoidance of the most obvious injustice or collective suicide			0
it has to be about a great deal more than politics built on grievance and the unhappiness of a resentful and selfish public sphere			0
’ former culture secretary dame @entity11 said @entity14 still had a lot to offer @entity80 politics and compared him to @entity82			1
she said : ‘ if it is simply a kind of combustible relationship where any intervention by @entity14 is seen as unwelcome , unhelpful … then i think that is destructive			2
‘ if you take someone like @entity82 … he is a kind of honoured , experienced older statesman that still has value and currency … and i think exactly the same applies to the @entity94 now and @entity14			0
’ a multi-millionaire former tax exile , who has pledged up to £ 1million to help mr @entity4 win the next election , said the @entity2 leader was ‘ committed to making a difference ’			1
property magnate @entity100 gave £ 500,000 last year			0
the latest pledge could see him become @entity2 ’s biggest backer outside the unions			0
mr @entity100 made an estimated £ 100million before spending five years in @entity104 , a move he insists was for lifestyle reasons			0
while there , he paid @entity104 taxes but not @entity80 capital gains or income tax			0
mr @entity4 has attacked ‘ predatory ’ capitalists , tax avoidance and the use of offshore tax havens , and acceptance of the money will lead to accusations of hypocrisy from the conservatives			0
observations : dame @entity11 , pictured , has compared @entity14 's status now to that of @entity82			1

three former cabinet ministers urged leader to clarify what he stands for
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 said follow @entity14 's advice
@entity4 fell and broke his left wrist a week *ago* while *walking* in the hills above @entity134 , @entity135 , aides *revealed* yesterday . he had a minor operation to set the broken bone .
