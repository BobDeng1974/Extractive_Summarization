revealing satellite images show how @entity1 has been flooded with darkness since the beginning of the civil war with 83 per cent of the country 's lights being extinguished since 2011			1
in a picture taken four years ago , the nation 's heavily - populated cities are clearly visible due to the dense cluster of lights they emit			1
but in a photo taken this month , major cities including the war - torn country 's capital @entity17 , have all but disappeared from sight due to destruction , power shortages and people fleeing their homes			1
the study was backed by 130 international ngos that are part of the # @entity45 coalition , which aims to raise awareness about the ongoing conflict			0
former @entity49 secretary of state @entity48 , who briefed the media on the results of the analysis , said : ' what is happening on the ground in @entity1 is a humanitarian and human rights catastrophe of the first order			0
' i believe it is the single most important issue in the @entity59 today , yet it sometimes feels as though the world has forgotten about it			0
destruction : once @entity1 's commercial hub , @entity64 has been devastated by fighting and has lost 97 per cent of its night - time light the war - torn city of @entity64 , pictured last week , barely shows on the satellite images after four years of civil conflict ' the international community can and must supply more intense political pressure to stop the violence and human rights abuses that are fueling this crisis			1
' more than 200,000 people have been killed and another four million have fled the country since the conflict between rebel groups and president @entity82 began in march 2011			1
in this period , the @entity83 has seized control of large swathes of territory in their bid to establish a caliphate across the @entity59			0
one of the most prominent eclipses depicted in the satellite images has taken place in the northern city of @entity64 where fierce fighting between rebels and @entity97 forces has decreased the night - time lights emitted by 97 per cent			1
in @entity97 - held cities such as @entity17 , the change has been less dramatic with a 35 per cent reduction in light output			1
also affected : the nation 's capital @entity17 has also been hit by fighting since 2011 with satellite imagery showing how night - time light has been reduced by 35 per cent people fleeing their homes , power shortages and physical destruction can all contribute to the decline in night light , which offers a unique glimpse into the destruction wrought by the violence in @entity1			1
according to research leader dr. @entity117 , the fall in night light over the course of the conflict is similar to what was seen in @entity124 over the course of the genocide in 1994			2
the scientist said ' the night light data never tells lies ' - but admitted that even he had been shocked at their findings			2
he added : ' more night lights lost means more displaced persons			0
. destruction of infrastructure and power shortages			0
' satellite imagery is the most objective source of data showing the devastation of @entity1 on a national scale			0
' taken from 500 miles above the @entity144 , these images help us understand the suffering and fear experienced by ordinary @entity1 every day as their country is destroyed around them			0
' condemned findings : former @entity151 foreign secretary @entity150 ( left ) and former @entity49 secretary of state @entity48 ( right ) have both expressed their sorrow at seeing the satellite images former @entity151 foreign secretary @entity150 tweeted about the research findings today former @entity151 foreign secretary @entity150 tweeted about the research findings , saying : ' for 4 yrs , @entity1 â€™s people have been plunged into the dark : fearful , grieving for friends lost & the country they once knew			2
' @entity1 deserve much better from int'l community			0
it 's past time to show that we will work with them to turn the lights back on ' in a press conference , mr @entity150 , no the president of the @entity166 , added : ' @entity1 is entering the dark ages , literally and metaphorically ' .			2
