the feature , rumoured to be launching from november , will let users add videos to their smartphones or tablets when they 're online , to watch at a later time offline			2
@entity1 said that the videos will be available for a ‘ short period ’ and according to @entity11 this could be as much as 48 hours			1
the feature will allow users to add videos to their smartphones or tablets to watch even when they do n't have access to the internet it is not clear whether the videos will be available as a temporary download and removed once the 48 hours has expired - similar to how the @entity18 handles offline shows on the @entity20 - or cached			1
‘ your fans ’ ability to enjoy your videos no longer has to be interrupted by something as commonplace as a morning commute , ’ @entity1 said in its @entity28 ’s blog			0
the videos will still be free and will have @entity30 ads running on them			0
the group announced the feature as part of its ongoing updates to its mobile app. last month , for example , @entity1 made it possible for people to browse video recommendations while streaming content			0
last year , the group dabbled in offline viewing by allowing @entity44 users to pre-cache their favourite channels for viewing later the latest development is a major move for the company as downloading video is against its terms of service			1
