by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 has revealed his disappointment at @entity6 's poor start to the @entity8 campaign and has called on his team - mates to show their true quality			1
@entity6 have picked up just one point in their opening two games of the season against @entity14 and @entity15 - leaving @entity16 frustrated			1
however the @entity17 , who said he felt ' good ' after playing his first game since @entity20 's third - place play - off match against @entity21 , believes @entity23 's side will regain their form in the next few weeks			1
clearly we came here to win , and if you go in front after 15 minutes or so , we should have at least held on to that for longer			2
' we were a bit too sloppy in possession , and in that sense we made it too hard for ourselves			2
' we ’ve played two games and only picked up one point , we would have loved to have got six points but it did n’t happen , so we have to bounce back			2
' public backing : @entity16 was full of praise for @entity23 after @entity6 's draw with @entity15 and @entity16 has backed compatriot @entity54 to turn @entity6 into a major @entity8 force once again			1
' i think that everyone has faith and everyone believes in the staff and players			0
we have great players , and it ’s just a matter of time before the points will start coming in			0
' i worked with @entity54 for two years , and he ’s very clear			0
' he ’s clear in what he asks of each player in the team every day			0
so , where i can , i will help the other players			0

@entity6 's @entity16 *unhappy* with ' sloppy ' play against @entity15
the @entity17 heaps praise on fellow *countryman* @entity23
@entity16 played *63* minutes against @entity15 following *return* to *fitness*
