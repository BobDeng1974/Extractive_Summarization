the car ferry that caught fire in the @entity2 killing ten people and injuring dozens more was found to have serious safety flaws during an inspection just 10 days ago			1
the @entity7 was examined by the international maritime authority @entity9 earlier this month and found to have faulty fire doors , too few life rafts and poor emergency lighting			1
the vessel , which was operated by @entity15 shipping company @entity14 , was also criticized for its plans for how to handle passengers in the event of an emergency - raising serious questions over whether the tragedy could have been prevented			1
the news comes as @entity23 officials launch an investigation to establish whether the fire started in one of the many lorries transporting olive oil from @entity15 to @entity23 , or if the highly flammable cargo simply added fuel the flames and made the deadly blaze even more intense			1
inspection : the @entity7 ( pictured ) was examined by the international maritime authority @entity9 just 10 days ago and found to have faulty fire doors , too few life rafts and poor emergency lighting details of the @entity7 's ' grave failings ' in regard to fire safety were published on @entity15 and @entity23 websites this morning , citing a inspection by @entity42 officials on december 19			1
six ' deficiencies ' are understood to have been identified relating to emergency lighting , fire doors and ' life saving appliances ' that were deemed not to meet international safety standards			1
officials are believed to have given @entity14 15 days to amend the problems but there is not yet any indication as to whether they had been addressed by the time the ferry left @entity53 in western @entity15 on its doomed voyage to @entity55 in eastern @entity23			2
trade unions have been quick to attack @entity15 shipping operator @entity14 and @entity23 shipowner , @entity58 , claiming corners were cut to increase profits			2
trapped : passengers , who were travelling from the @entity15 port of @entity63 to @entity55 , @entity23 , became trapped on the top decks as gales and choppy seas hampered evacuation efforts a statement from four trade unions representing @entity15 shipping crews read : ' once again , it is proven that shipowners ' hunt for profit overrides the necessary measures for the protection of human life at sea			2
' ' as has been revealed behind the tragic shipwreck and fire there are serious failures in sea worthiness of vessels with painful consequences for passengers and ship workers , ' it added			2
' with the fire that broke out in the car decks of the @entity90 the lives of 478 passengers was put at risk , ' the four unions went on to say			2
@entity94 , owner of @entity95 , fought back however , saying his company had worked alongside the rescue operation and helped save the lives of several hundred people			0
an injured passenger is transported to hospital in the @entity23 port city of @entity103 after being rescued in the southern @entity23 city of @entity103 , where many of those rescued from the @entity90 were taken for treatment , judge @entity104 this morning opened an investigation into how the disaster occured , raising the possibility that individuals could be charged with ' culpable shipwreck			0
' the probe also aims to establish whether the fire could have started in one of the many lorries on board carrying a cargo of olive oil			0
such claims are bound to raise questions over whether the correct procedures were followed to prevent the highly flammable liquid coming in to contact with naked flames , and if there was sufficient equipment was on hand that could have prevented a small fire becoming a deadly blaze			1
trade unions have also raised the suggestion that the vessel may have been overcrowded , and there remains much confusion over exactly how many people were on board the car ferry			0
@entity23 coast guard teams at @entity140 harbour carry the body of on of those who died on board the ferry this afternoon the @entity23 authorities said the total death toll for the disaster had risen to ten , adding that they they are checking to see if anyone else might still be missing			1
@entity23 's transport minister , @entity150 , said the total of 427 rescued included all 56 crew members			0
the original manifest listed 478 passengers and crew , with officials earlier saying they are unable to immediately explain why only 435 individuals had been accounted for			0
@entity150 said it was premature to speculate on whether people were still missing , but suggested that there might have been some people who reserved a spot on the ferry but did not board			0
an official said that among the survivors , there were also people not listed on the manifest , indicating the possibility that some on board were traveling illegally			0
specialist @entity23 coast guard are continuing to search the interior of the ferry amid flames and heavy rain , and five @entity15 helicopters , a @entity15 frigate and another ship are still in the area .			0

@entity182 was found to have faulty fire doors and too few life rafts
inspectors also criticised vessel for poor emergency lighting and for not having sufficient plans to deal with passengers in an emergency
operator was given until @entity194 to amend the safety issues
not known whether any had been addressed by time of the deadly blaze
death toll in @entity2 disaster is now ten but could still rise further
