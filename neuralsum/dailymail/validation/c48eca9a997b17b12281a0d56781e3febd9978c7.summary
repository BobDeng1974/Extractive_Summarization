the @entity0 must continue to improve intelligence gathering efforts as national security threats are outpacing the agency 's ability to counter them , according to a report released wednesday			1
an audit of the agency requested by @entity8 noted the headway made since the september 11 attacks , which brought criticism that law enforcement agencies were not sharing information			1
the report said in many ways the agency still came up short , as worries continue that groups such as @entity18 are exerting their influence on @entity20 and could strike on @entity20 soil			2
criticized : a report requested by @entity8 noted the @entity0 's improvement since the september 11 terrorist attacks but knocked the agency failing to properly gather and analyze human intelligence			1
pictured : fbi director @entity26 testifies ' these threats are not just knocking on the door			1
they 're in the room , ' said former representative @entity31			0
@entity31 was a member of the original commission that prepared a report in the aftermath of the 2001 attacks , faulting the @entity0 and @entity36 for intelligence shortcomings			2
the newly commissioned report was tasked with reviewing how the @entity0 had responded to recommendations laid out in the original investigation and how it has handled counterterrorism over the last decade			0
it 's release coincides with fbi director @entity26 's visit to @entity46 , where he has asked for $ 8.48billion to boost funding for new initiatives , including cyber activities			1
the report called for the agency to further integrate intelligence gathering and analysis , and tasked it with ' professionalizing ' its intelligence analysts , strategically using analysts in specialized roles			2
the report emphasized the agency 's development of human intelligence is not improving along with efforts to share intelligence among agencies			1
scrutiny : the report coincided with @entity26 's trip to @entity46 to defend an $ 8.48billion request for extra funding in front of a @entity72 subcommittee ' this imbalance needs urgently to be addressed to meet growing and increasingly complex national security threats , including from adaptive and increasingly tech - savvy terrorists , more brazen computer hackers , and more technically capable , global cyber syndicates , ' the report stated			1
the report also faulted leadership changes for slowing improvement			0
it recommended the @entity0 coordinate with private sector entities as a way to counter cyber threats			0
the report covered five terror plots that had occurred over the last several years , which includes the 2009 @entity89 shooting and the 2013 @entity90			0
though it found communication and coordination hiccups between branches of the @entity0 , the report said there was no certainty the attacks could have been averted if these metrics were improved			2
it cited some cases where information that could have been leveraged to forecast attacks was not gathered or analyzed by the @entity0			0
a 2012 rant at a mosque from @entity106 bomber @entity105 was n't caught by the @entity0 at the time , and @entity108 - @entity20 cab driver @entity107 was not identified until his plan to blow up the @entity111 subway was thwarted , according to the report			0
' what 's written in there is not a surprise to anybody in the @entity0 ` cause we have squeezed those cases trying to understand what could we do better , ' @entity26 said .			0
