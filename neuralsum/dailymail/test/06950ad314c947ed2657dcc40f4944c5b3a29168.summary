' open prisons like @entity11 are used for prisoners who are trusted to serve their sentences with minimal supervision and perimeter security and are not locked up in prison cells			1

the men at @entity11 get television at 50p per week , hobbies kits and @entity213			2
but although they are deemed trustworthy enough not to be locked up in a cell , in june 2014 , @entity11 was revealed to have the worst record for fugitive inmates , with 89 on the run			1
@entity117 pledged it was ' determined to find all those still at large '			2
but at the time it only released the names of those it deemed the greatest risk to the public , saying it could not justify releasing the ' personal information ' on the others			0
following a @entity58 request made in september last year , the @entity13 took around six months to respond and did not reveal the names of ten of the 39 prisoners due to ' concerns regarding police investigation and / or risk of harm to the victim '			1
@entity236 , spokesman for the @entity238 trade union for prison workers , today insisted it should not have to take a freedom of information battle to get the names of prisoners on the run			2
he said : ' the court sentences people to prison because they have lost trust in them			0
' so for me , if they walk out of prison , they have broken that trust even further and the public should be made aware that			0
' they should say , ' so - and - so has walked out of prison and while we do n't consider him a risk to the public , he should be brought back '			0
' the @entity13 says eligibility for open prisons has now been revised as part of ' significant work ' to tighten the system			2
but mr @entity236 said ' major problems ' contributing to prisoners running away still needed to be addressed			0
he added : ' there is constant overcrowding and inappropriate prisoners are being sent to open prison when they obviously pose a serious risk to the public			0
