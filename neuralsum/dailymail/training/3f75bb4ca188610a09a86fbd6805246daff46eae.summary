the @entity6 has an ingenious way of spotting motorists who drink , text or do n't wear seat belts at the wheel - by patrolling the motorways in a 40 - tonne lorry			2
the 18 - wheel juggernaut gives him the perfect vantage point from which to peer into other cars and spot any un-driver - like behaviour			2

looking down on drivers : the 18 - wheel juggernaut gives state trooper @entity2 the perfect vantage point from which to peer into other cars and spot any un-driver - like behaviour so instead he just radios police headquarters with what he sees and the control room dispatches a team of troopers to chase the outlaws down in patrol cars and dish out tickets			1
' we should be able to nab some people here ' , he told @entity38 on thursday morning			0
and sure enough , he snared no less than seven offenders from his cab that day , six feet in the air			2
he is one of 97 officers in the state who carry a heavy goods licence so they too can trundle the roads peering into passing cars			1
it is the brainchild of lt. @entity48 who asked @entity2 to drive the semi as part of ' stay alive on 75 , ' a police initiative to raise awareness about crashes on the highway			1
