‘ i am deeply shocked			1
he was n’t involved in a collision with anybody			0
‘ it was just after making a pass with the outside of his foot that he injured his leg so it ’s very hard to believe that you can damage your ligament with just making a simple pass and it ’s very difficult to take that he will be out for a while			0
’ @entity1 has a lengthy injury list as he heads into this weekend ’s fixture against @entity69 in the @entity70 at the @entity71 , but the @entity5 manager insists it is just a coincidence			1

the big injuries we have are really accidental			0

we have been hit hard after seven games			0
i would never have thought we would have had so many bad injuries			0

already they are nine points behind @entity10 after just seven games and four behind champions @entity96			2
the @entity5 chief added : ‘ that ’s an old , ridiculous debate - i honestly never understand what is @entity109 and @entity103 and @entity110 it ’s a debate of another age			0
‘ i ’ve watched the @entity10 game again and we were guilty of not taking the first chances which were there for us and guilty of making a defensive mistake on their goal , but there was very little between the two teams on the day			2
@entity6 gets a hug from @entity10 boss @entity92 after the match at @entity84 ‘ i think we came out angry and frustrated but also coming that we have an important part to play in this championship			1
‘ we can only look at ourselves and think if we want to get something out of the big games we can not afford to make the mistakes we made on the two goals			0
‘ it was traumatic for me			0
the way we lost was very difficult to take			0
the quality of the team is to make the maximum with what you produce on the day and that ’s where we failed			0

he added : ‘ i believe that maybe going forward , @entity96 are a bit more complete			2
‘ @entity96 are more offensive			0
@entity10 defensively are better but it ’s very difficult to say who will be in front but what we want to do is be in front of both of them			2
‘ it is massive , the nine points ( gap ) after seven games , i agree completely , but it is not lost			0
’ @entity158 scored from the penalty spot after @entity37 's foul on the @entity162 playmaker @entity163 finished a @entity81 pass to send @entity5 to their first league defeat of the season @entity168 out for up to 12 weeks with knee injury			2
