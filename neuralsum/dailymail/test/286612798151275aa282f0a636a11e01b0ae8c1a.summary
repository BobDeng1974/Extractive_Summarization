they gave us sanitation , wine , aqueducts and roads , but it seems the @entity6 also gave us one more addition to the list - tuberculosis			2
researchers have isolated bacterial dna of several strains of the disease from the bodies of mummies found in the crypt of a church in the city of @entity18 in @entity19			1
they found 14 different strains of @entity22 bacteria that had infected eight of the bodies in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source			1
mummified remains of 28 - year - old @entity28 ( above ) found in the 18th century crypt of the @entity31 church in @entity18 , @entity19 , were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers they say the strains of @entity22 they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late @entity39 period			1
professor @entity40 , a geneticist at @entity41 who led the work , said : ' by showing that historical strains can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineages , we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that has ravaged the heart of @entity49 since prehistoric times			1
' historians have long taught that @entity53 populations were almost wiped out by diseases such as tuberculosis , brought to the @entity56 by @entity49 explorers			0
but a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame			0
scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to @entity66 where it spread - long before @entity67 arrived in 1492			0
while estimates vary , it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the @entity71 before the @entity49 arrived were killed by ‘ new ’ diseases carried by explorers			0
anthropological geneticists @entity75 of @entity76 and @entity77 of the @entity78 in @entity79 have studied pre-columbian @entity81 tuberculosis genomes			2
the team examined @entity84 from 1,000 - year - old skeletons found in @entity86 as well as other samples and compared them to modern genomes			0
they found a clear relationship to @entity22 lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions			1
the study , which is published in the journal @entity98 , used samples taken from the mummified remains of 26 people who had been buried in a cyrpt of @entity18 's @entity31 church during the 18th century			1
workers attempting to restore the church stumbled on the remains of nearly 200 people in the crypt in 1994			0
the bodies had become naturally mummified in the exceptionally dry air			0
the bodies , many of whom had been wealthy @entity114 , had been placed in the crypt fully clothed and in coffins between 1731 and 1838			0
walled up and forgotten for about 150 years , the coffins were discovered when a construction worker tapped on a wall during renovation work			0
part of the wall gave way to reveal coffins decotrated with skulls and stacked from floor to ceiling			0
the researchers found that eight of the 26 bodies they examined showed signs that they had died of tuberculosis , five of whom had suffered from multiple strains			1
it is the first evidence that mixed infections of multiple strains of @entity22 were common in the 18th century			1
the researchers found that all of the strains belonged to a lineage of @entity22 bacteria known as @entity141 4 , which still causes more than a million tb cases a year in @entity49 and @entity66			1
by analysing the dna from these bacteria , the researchers were able to trace back the evolutionary history of the different strains they found by looking for genetic changes that had occurred			2
@entity22 is caused by the bacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis			2
the researchers found several different the mummies were discovered during restoration work at the @entity31 church in @entity18 , @entity19 ( above ) they found that they all seemed to stem from a single strain of tuberculosis that was in existence between 396ce - 470ce			1
the @entity39 dating supports recent scientific estimates that tuberculosis first emerged about 6,000 years ago , although some have suggested the disease is tens of thousands of years old			0
writing in the journal , the researchers said : ' phylogenetic dating places the most recent common ancestor of this lineage in the late @entity39 period			0
' our dating is consistent with evidence that a strain containing the pks15 / 1 deletion was present in @entity174 by the second – fourth centuries @entity175 ' the findings also suggest that at the time when the mummies died , @entity22 was already raging in @entity49 and killing large numbers of people even before urbanisation and crowded housing created devastating epidemics			1
the dry climate in the crypt preserved the bodies and clothing of the people placed there in the 18th century the church where the mummies were found is in @entity18 in the @entity192 region of northern @entity19 ( shown above ) professor @entity40 , who conducted the work along with researchers at the @entity196 , @entity197 , the @entity198 in @entity199 and the @entity19 @entity200 in @entity201 , said : ' microbiological analysis of samples from contemporary @entity22 patients usually report a single strain of tuberculosis per patient			1
' by contrast , five of the eight bodies in our study yielded more than one type of tuberculosis - remarkably , from one individual , we obtained evidence of three distinct strains			2
' dr @entity216 , the first author of the study , added that their analysis had revealed some of the tragic toll the disease was having at the time			0
she said : ' poignantly , we found evidence of an intimate link between strains from in a middle - aged mother and her grown - up daughter , suggesting both family members died from this devastating infection			2

more than 200 mummified bodies were found in a hidden crypt of the @entity31 church in the city of @entity18 in @entity19 during restoration work
geneticists led by scientists at the @entity41 studied samples from 26 of the bodies and found that eight of them had died of tuberculosis
they discovered dna of 14 different strains of @entity22 bacteria in the mummies
analysis showed the strains all descended from a single strain that begun causing infections during the late roman empire between 396ce - @entity255
