as career moves go , they do n’t come any more extreme than swapping @entity2 for @entity3			1
from @entity5 grit to @entity6			0
sitting in his seaside apartment in the upmarket @entity10 suburb of @entity11 , @entity7 has had time to reflect on the dramatic switch that took him to the @entity15 in the summer after six years at @entity16			1
‘ it ’s the biggest change i ’ve had in my life , ’ says the former @entity18 and @entity19 under 21 goalkeeper ‘ there ’s all the culture surrounding the place — and i live by the sea , so it ’s drastically different from the streets of @entity5			1
people ask how i ’ve adapted but it ’s not like i ’ve gone to @entity30			2
goalkeeper @entity7 has joined @entity32 side @entity3 after a six - year stint with @entity2 @entity7 on moving : ‘ i did n’t have any regrets staying that long but i needed to be put out of my comfort zone ' born : @entity19 , september 24 , 1984 ( 30 ) 1999 - 2002 : @entity36 ( 2 lg apps ) 2002 - 2006 : @entity18 ( 0 ) 2004 - 2005 : @entity38 ( loan ) ( 32 ) 2006 - 2006 : @entity38 ( loan ) ( 0 ) 2006 - 2008 : @entity40 ( 2 ) 2006 - 2007 : @entity41 ( loan ) ( 5 ) 2008 - 2014 : @entity2 ( 209 ) 2014 - now : @entity3 ( 1 ) ‘ i did n’t have any regrets staying that long but i needed to be put out of my comfort zone			1
this is a new life and a new beginning			0
the adventure really appealed to me , being thrown in the deep end			0
‘ it ’s a short career and i ’m just about at the halfway point			2
i really want to achieve things in football , not just plod along and see it out			0
‘ if i really wanted to kick on and reach the places i ’ve dreamed of , like playing in the top leagues or in @entity57 , i needed to change completely			1
’ a clause in his contract meant that @entity7 could leave on a free transfer when @entity2 were relegated last season			1
there were two opportunities to join bigger championship clubs but the 30 - year - old had caught the eye of @entity68 , the former @entity69 defender who is now technical director at @entity3			2
the 20 - time @entity32 champions were offering a two - year contract and the lure of @entity57 football			2
‘ he said he wanted to meet me face to face in @entity76 , ’ recalls @entity7			1
‘ it ’s a @entity32 thing			1
they like to look you in the eye and make sure you ’re up to the job			0
apparently i passed the eye test			0
’ the @entity36 - born keeper has not been afraid to make bold decisions before			0
@entity7 played under @entity85 and @entity86 during four years at @entity18 , and was an @entity88 winner in 2003 , but he left @entity89 for @entity40 in search of first - team football			1
‘ i did n’t expect to be here , ’ says @entity7 , who shot to prominence when he starred in @entity2 ’s @entity93 wins over @entity94 and @entity95 in 2008 after signing from @entity40 on loan			1
@entity98 of @entity99 is denied by @entity100 during their championship match ‘ i did n’t set out to sign for @entity3 , but i made the decision pretty quickly			1
‘ i thought that it would n’t happen but the move was agreed at 10pm and i was on the 8.30am flight from @entity107 the next day			0
‘ this felt right , especially the attraction of playing in @entity111 qualifiers			0
we ended up in the @entity113 but @entity57 football was huge for me			0
’ @entity7 admits he was a little naive about the move but was given a crash course in the passion of @entity32 fans during a pre-season ‘ friendly ’ at lower league @entity119			1
‘ i could n’t believe it , ’ he says			2
‘ i thought there would be two or three hundred and there were thousands			0
it was like they ’d just been let out of prison for their first football match			0
‘ there were fireworks and smoke bombs — and this was a pre-season friendly			0
i came on in the second half and i was jumping around because firecrackers were going off behind me			0
‘ that got blown out of the water when i went to the @entity3 stadium and saw our fans for the first time			1
you ’ve got @entity143 who are the fanatics			0
they ’re behind one of the goals like a hive of bees			0
the noise , the smoke bombs , the fireworks			0
’ that was @entity7 ’s league debut , a 1 - 0 win over @entity155 in september			1
four days earlier , he played his first competitive game on his 30th birthday in a @entity158 - tie against @entity159 , not to be confused with his club ’s bitter @entity10 rivals @entity160			2
@entity163 striker @entity162 celebrates scoring against @entity2 goalkeeper @entity7 at the @entity165 @entity166 of @entity167 sees his close range header saved by goalkeeper @entity7 of @entity2 games between the teams are known rather dramatically as the @entity172 , and the exaggeration is only slight			1
this is one of the most hostile encounters in football			0
away supporters are now banned but that did not stop @entity3 fans setting fire to their own stadium two years ago			1
in march , their coach @entity182 was floored by an object thrown by the home fans at @entity160 ’ @entity185 — which hosts the first derby of this season a week on sunday			0
‘ i ’ve been told it ’s on a different planet , ’ says @entity7			1
‘ i ’ve seen some crazy footage and heard of police getting involved in the dressing rooms			2
i ’ve played in big games but this might be a bit different			0
’ @entity7 believes his @entity32 adventure could open the door to a move to the @entity198 , and has not abandoned hope of a senior @entity19 call - up after representing his country at every age - group			1
‘ i ’ll be 31 by the time i finish here and , being realistic , i can play for 10 more years , ’ he says			2
‘ i never think my chance has gone			0
’ meantime , will he be taking in much of @entity6 ? ‘ my advice is go to the @entity207 but go once			2
it ’s one of the oldest buildings in the world and i did love each of the 45 minutes i was there , but i ’m not going to be getting a degree in @entity32 history			2
‘ for me , it ’s pretty much sand , sea , crazy football fans and @entity3			1
