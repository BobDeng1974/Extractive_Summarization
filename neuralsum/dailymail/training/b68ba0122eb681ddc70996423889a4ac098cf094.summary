@entity8 was six weeks pregnant when she was knifed by @entity5
@entity3 was trying to earn money to support family when she was killed
the trial could not establish the motive for the killing
the prosecution suggested @entity39 may have rejected @entity5 , or that he had warned her away from the mosque
the 21 - year - old tried to claim in court that he was victim of mistaken identity
but he was found guilty by jurors and will spend 29 years in jail for murder
an earlier version of this *article* said that mr @entity5 had killed @entity120 because she was working near a mosque . in fact , this was one of two possible motives suggested by the prosecution and was not confirmed by mr @entity5 .
