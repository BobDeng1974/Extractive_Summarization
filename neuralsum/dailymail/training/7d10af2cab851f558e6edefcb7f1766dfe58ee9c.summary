by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 is 5ft 10in with a movie - star name to match her prolific talent			1
yet she is still just 17 years old ; a schoolgirl waiting for her as exam results in @entity6 , pe and business this summer			1
her selection as the youngest member of @entity6 ’s athletics team for the @entity12 in @entity13 caused those two worlds of teenager and athlete to collide , perhaps a little too soon			1
as revealed by @entity17 , @entity1 has withdrawn from the @entity12 to compete in the heptathlon at the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
she decided to prioritise her long - term ambitions but was also concerned about the lack of contact she would have with her father and coach , @entity27 , as he would not have been allowed to stay in the athletes ’ village			1
this allowed @entity6 to call up @entity31 , 30 , as @entity1 ’s replacement but also sparked much debate and some criticism			1
disgruntled : teenage heptathlon star @entity1 has pulled out of @entity6 's team team : @entity39 heptathlon @entity37 with her father and coach @entity40 @entity1 ’s father left it entirely for her to decide			1
@entity27 , 45 , a former @entity39 junior international triple jumper now working as an it consultant , is not a pushy parent			1
‘ it was a difficult one ; a real dilemma , ’ he said , ‘ but @entity1 thought the right thing to do was the @entity49			1
it was her choice , not mine or anyone else ’s			2
‘ the athletes ’ village was a factor			1
you do n’t want to expose her to that environment without all of her usual support structure around her			0
‘ she ’s just 17 and we did n’t take all these things into account when she was first selected			1
it ’s late notice but it ’s the right solution in terms of @entity1 ’s long - term development			1
people like @entity67 went through @entity49 before they graduated to seniors			0
we wanted to do both but we were n’t allowed			0
’ success has come quickly for @entity37 , the @entity39 junior heptathlon record - holder and second on the under - 20 all - time list behind @entity73 after scoring 6,081 points in @entity75 , @entity76 , last month			0
she trains for only an hour a few times a week yet still has nearly three years to better @entity73 ’s under - 20 score of 6,287 points			2
star : @entity1 , 17 , has already broken @entity73 's @entity39 junior heptathlon record new home : the @entity82 for the 2014 @entity12 in @entity13 pop 's star : @entity37 in action in the girls heptathlon during day 4 of the @entity87 @entity39 ’s heptahlon pedigree is impressive			1
@entity90 and @entity91 have both won @entity93 gold this century and @entity73 , still only 21 , is tipped for glory in @entity13			0
@entity37 has also recently been warm - weather training in @entity96 with @entity97 , the 16 - year - old daughter of @entity39 olympians @entity98 and @entity99			0
@entity1 said : ‘ i remember watching @entity100 at the @entity93 and thinking it was amazing to see a heptathlete in the limelight			1
i watched it and thought , “ i ’d like to be at the @entity93 one day ”			2
‘ @entity100 and @entity105 have all the records so it ’s something for me to chase ; milestones to achieve			2
for the @entity109 in @entity110 i just want to make the team			2
who knows about four or eight years after that ? ’ @entity37 is more like @entity114 than @entity115			0
she excels in the throws and high jump , in which she has cleared 1.93metres this season , although a 200m lifetime best of 24.59sec was her personal highlight of the performance in @entity75			0
she was called @entity123 because her parents were expecting a boy			0
she started athletics when she was just five , she and younger brother @entity126 following dad to the track			0
@entity132 ‘ is n’t sporty but knows all my results , ’ says @entity1 , with a smile			2
what could be an intense relationship between father ( coach ) and daughter is helped by the fact @entity1 is still at boarding school in @entity140			1
‘ it ’s good having @entity142 as a coach , ’ she says , ‘ most of the time ! he ’s been through it when he was younger , so he can help me get through the hard stuff			2
it ’s a good balance			0
’ @entity27 , though , admits it can be difficult combining the roles			2
‘ when things are going well it ’s brilliant , ’ he says , ‘ but there are days when it ’s like @entity154 and @entity155			0
then we look at it , discuss it and in the end she does what i want her to do			0
‘ but she ’s a fighter			0
she ’s determined in training but the best comes out of her in competitions			0
she was n’t always the most talented , or the most natural but she worked hard to become the best			0

@entity1 pulled out of @entity6 ’s team for the @entity12
@entity1 ’s father and coach @entity27 is eligible for *accreditation* for day passes
but no parents or *guardians* can stay in the village with the 6,500 athletes
@entity1 , 17 , has just finished her @entity174 exams
