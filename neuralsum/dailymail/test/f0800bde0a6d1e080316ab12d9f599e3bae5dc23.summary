he ’s a tv star with a love for adventure , so it ’s no wonder @entity4 looks for somewhere a little bit extraordinary for his holiday			1
my husband and i see the tv star lazing with his little boy by one of the five swimming pools in the @entity12 in @entity13 , soaking up the sun. the high - end resort , which opened in 2010 , is renowned as being one of the best in the @entity18 for a luxury family holiday			1
the beautiful @entity20 is a hit with families - and tv stars such as @entity4 but despite the sun shining for around 300 days of the year here and the golden sand being warm beneath your toes , the water is cold @entity20 , which boasts a fine - dining restaurant , is the only five - star resort in the area to have direct access to a beach , and is set within 25 hectares in the protected @entity36			1
so we ’ve come to check it out – after all , why should the kids have all the fun ? from the balcony in our chic @entity42 , we are afforded an incredible view over the glistening waters of the @entity45 from the most south - westerly point in the @entity18			1
but despite the sun shining for around 300 days of the year here and the golden sand being warm beneath your toes , do n’t be fooled – the sea is sharp - intake - of - breath cold			1
adventurer , author , broadcaster and writer @entity4 is a regular at @entity20 couples can overlook the ocean , read the papers , feast on fresh orange juice , and enjoy a classy breakfast the resort boasts a stunning swimming pool surrounded by decking - and close to a restaurant the boutique room in which we stay for three nights is in the resort 's hotel			1
there are also 152 hours and villas in the vicinity , so with 190 accommodation options , there is plenty of choice			1
we ’re just a short walk from the main reception building , as well as the beach			1
inside , the décor is minimalist and comfortable , soft pastel hues , blend well with the wooden floor , mixing stone , cork and other locally sourced materials for this @entity87 - designed interior			1
for larger families , there is the villa option – 23 award - winning , independently owned properties , with three or four large bedrooms , a parking space , a bbq area as well as easy access to the facilities and swimming pools			1
for larger families , there is the villa option – 23 award - winning , independently owned properties , with three or four large bedroom @entity20 , which boasts a fine - dining restaurant , is the only five - star resort in the area to have direct access to a beach , and is set within 25 hectares in the protected @entity36 holidaymakers can also choose to stay in villas at the high - end resort there ’s also a baby concierge service providing equipment to guests – including door protectors , potties , bottle sterilisers , cots , baths and pushchairs			1
it ’s june and the place is busy – i ’m told it ’s almost at capacity , but the only time you can really tell how many people are staying here is at breakfast			0
it ’s an all - you - can - eat buffet style option in the first - floor @entity135 restaurant – which offers a la carte dining in the evening			1
in the morning , there ’s a hum of excitement ; parents doing their best to feed their offspring who know exactly what they do and do n’t want to eat			0
my husband and i eat on the terrace , overlooking the ocean , reading the papers , feasting on fresh orange juice , eggs cooked the way we like them , fresh fruit , cereal , pastries and croissants			0
after breakfast , there are seemingly endless options for children – from face painting , treasure hunts , arts and crafts , to windsurfing , dolphin watching , swimming tennis and football			0
@entity168 , with its quirky decoration and @entity171 camper van hiding in the corner , is the place for a light lunch the balcony offers a scenic view across the glistening waters of the @entity45 the view is breathtaking – sea - carved cliffs jut out around a long , wide beach which is warm beneath your toes so while all that ’s going on , the golden - sanded beach looks relatively deserted			1
we wander down , and the view is breathtaking – sea - carved cliffs jut out around a long , wide beach			1
there ’s plenty of space , so even if everyone at the resort decided to spend the day at the beach , there ’s room for them all			2
so i spend the morning soaking up the rays while @entity200 attempts paddleboarding for the first time			0
i ’m not sure whether it was the fear of falling into the chilly water or that he is a natural , but he makes it all the way out to a small island without falling off – 15 minutes there and 15 back			0
for a day trip , @entity20 is located next to the historic fishing port of @entity213 , one of @entity216 ’s surfing capitals , which boasts rugged cliff faces , as well as a 15th - century port on the southern-most tip of the peninsular ; giving it an end - of - the - world quality			2
for lunch , there a small shop where guests can buy their own food ( although it is more expensive than other local shops due to being in - resort )			2
or there are three restaurants to choose from ; as @entity233 , overlooking the beach , offers fresh seafood dishes and a children ’s menu ; @entity237 dishes up pizza and pasta ; and @entity168 is the place for a light lunch			2
there are also four bars across the resort			0
the boutique room in which we stay for three nights is in the resort 's hotel			2
there are also 152 hours and villas in the vicinity , so with 190 accommodation options , there is plenty of choice unlike other posh restaurants , guests are welcome to bring their children			2
couples seated near to us have babies by their sides , and our meal is n't disturbed in the slightest and after treatments , there ’s a garden relaxation area in which to chill out even further my husband whiles away the afternoon with a swim followed by a game of tennis – there are two courts and @entity20 is home to the @entity18 ’s @entity277 - while i book in for some serious pampering in the spa			1
@entity280 lies apart from the rest of the resort and is an oasis of calm			0
there are six treatment rooms as well as a wet area with a sauna and steam bath – and after treatments , there ’s a garden relaxation area in which to chill out even further			0
i can see this would be the perfect place for frazzled mums to recharge while their little ones are being looked after			0
i book for a 50 - minute massage and leave feeling as though all my worries have been massaged away			2
we are booked into the fine dining @entity301 for our evening meal			0
with white tablecloths , a delicious - sounding menu and an extensive wine list , it really is the ultimate luxury			1
however , unlike other posh restaurants , guests are welcome to bring their children			0
couples seated near to us have babies by their sides , and our meal is n't disturbed in the slightest			0
our villa overlooks the stunning ocean - which is deceptively cold ! for larger families , there is the villa option – 23 award - winning , independently owned properties , with three or four large bedrooms with top quality regional restaurants from both the ' surf ' and the ' turf ' , the restaurant offers a ' culinary journey through @entity13 gastronomy ' presented with a modern twist			1
dishes include braised scallops , beetroot puree , smoked ham and watercress as well as beef carpaccio , feta cheese , rocket and basil sauce for starters			0
then there is octopus , sea bass , mussels , duck breast , sirloin and lamb for mains , with tofu curry or vegetable @entity349 for vegetarians			0
there 's an impressive cheeseboard to finish , as well as a selection of dessert wines			2
it ’s a very grown - up finish to a luxury holiday in a resort which caters for families but is uncompromising in delivering high standards for all its guests			1
and if it ’s good enough for @entity4 ; it ’s good enough for us			0
