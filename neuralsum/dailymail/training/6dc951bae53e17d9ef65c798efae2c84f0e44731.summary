@entity112 midfielder @entity111 is a £ 25m target and a top central defender is also needed , although @entity116 ’s @entity115 remains off limits unless the @entity119 club are knocked out of @entity121 competition early			2
@entity1 have failed to win any of their opening three league games but received some good news for their next fixture when @entity126 @entity125 defender @entity78 , 24 , was granted a work permit following his £ 16m summer move from @entity129			0
