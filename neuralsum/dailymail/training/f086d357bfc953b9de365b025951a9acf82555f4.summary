the @entity27 attacked @entity15 and the @entity16 as ‘ enemies of democracy ’ for their stance , insisting the majority of voters want a say on the @entity35 issue			0
but some ministers privately doubt the wisdom of the prime minister ’s backing for the @entity3			2
its failure risks confusing voters after his public pledge to hold a referendum by 2017 if he remains in @entity46			0

the @entity59 president used a summit between the two countries to tell the prime minister that the @entity13 ‘ can not be expected ’ to follow the example of just one country			2

mr @entity7 said last night : ‘ today the @entity15 in the @entity24 voted to block our @entity3 that would have ensured a referendum on @entity14 ’s @entity13 membership by the end of 2017			1
‘ this is disappointing news for all of us , but we are not going to give up in our efforts to turn our referendum commitment into law			0
after all , we succeeded in passing it through the @entity111 – a huge achievement			0
‘ we are going to try to re-introduce the same @entity3 in the next session of @entity20 and , if necessary , rely on the provisions in the @entity20 to stop @entity15 and @entity16 peers killing the @entity3 once again			1
‘ irrespective of these attempts , the @entity116 remains absolutely committed to giving the @entity14 people their say in a referendum			0

’ conservative hq went further , branding @entity15 and the @entity16 ‘ enemies of democracy ’			0
