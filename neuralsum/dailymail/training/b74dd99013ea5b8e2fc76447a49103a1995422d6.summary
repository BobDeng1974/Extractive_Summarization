the audience sat transfixed as the beautiful ballerina and her handsome prince danced with extraordinary chemistry during the closing scenes of @entity5			0
what the cheering @entity7 crowd did n’t know , however , was that the classic @entity10 fairytale they just witnessed concealed a real - life secret – the most romantic of marriage proposals			0
it came as @entity16 , danced by @entity17 , was asked for directions in the @entity19 , her childhood sweetheart @entity20			1
childhood sweethearts @entity20 and @entity22 , pictured in 2009 , have married after @entity20 proposed on stage romance : they had performed their @entity5 duet dozens of times - but @entity20 added a secret twist one night it was a duet they had performed together dozens of times and required him to hand her a note			1
only now – unbeknown to either @entity35 or the audience – the note read : ‘ will you marry me ? ’ as she theatrically perused the words , her professionalism never faltered			2
instead , she merely pointed and hurried off stage , as the storyline demanded			2
moments later , as the curtain fell and enchanted ballet fans left the theatre , soloist @entity20 approached her backstage in front of the entire troupe			1
he dropped to one knee , presented her with a ring and popped the question verbally			1
miss @entity22 said ‘ yes ’ and yesterday the proposal culminated in a spring wedding – the first of five female dancers with the company planning to tie the knot this year			1
‘ i was really surprised , ’ she said			0
‘ luckily , i was supposed to point the @entity5 in the right direction and run off stage			2
dancing bride : @entity22 , as @entity16 in @entity5 , is usually handed a note asking for directions to the @entity19 during her duet with @entity20			1
but she was left stunned one night when it in fact read : ' will you marry me ? ' wedded bliss : @entity22 greets her bridesmaids as she arrives for her wedding to @entity20 in @entity71 yesterday ' @entity20 had asked the stage manager for permission to switch the note			1
but the only people who knew were my mum and dad in the audience , as @entity20 had rung them to ask their permission to marry me			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity17 said : ‘ as you might imagine , @entity22 was somewhat taken aback on stage			1
‘ but as this happened right at the end of the performance , she at least did n’t have to perform another solo while thinking about her response			0
’ among the first to congratulate the couple after the proposal was @entity90 , then chief executive of the @entity7 and now director - general of the @entity92			2
they are one of five couples in the company getting married this year , featured in the current edition of @entity98 magazine he described the on - set proposal as ‘ the most romantic performance the main stage has ever seen			0
’ yesterday , the couple married at the @entity104 in @entity71 where miss @entity22 ’s stonemason grandfather had worked on the building ’s restoration in the 1970s			1
now both aged 30 , they first met two decades ago after finishing joint first in a children ’s dancing competition			0
but it was not until they began training at the @entity115 as teenagers that they began dating			0
their performances in @entity5 – which has been staged at @entity7 every @entity122 for 30 years – was described by one captivated critic as having ‘ a curving , almost delirious freedom in the upper body ’			0
@entity22 has played numerous roles in the @entity17 and has built a particularly strong relationship with @entity129 , who has described her as having ‘ a presence on stage like no other ’			1
@entity20 has a similarly impressive repertoire , with roles as varied as @entity135 in @entity136 ’s @entity137 , @entity138 in @entity139 and @entity140 in @entity141			2
the four other ballerina brides walking down the aisle this year are @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			0
miss @entity146 is marrying another @entity17 dancer , @entity148			0
all five women are featured in a photoshoot for the current edition of @entity98 magazine .			0
