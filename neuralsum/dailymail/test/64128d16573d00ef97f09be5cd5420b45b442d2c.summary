' there are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we do n't know what her diet and eating habits were like before			2
' by eating lean meat , good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together			0
