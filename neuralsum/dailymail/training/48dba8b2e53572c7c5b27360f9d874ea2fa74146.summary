pub owner and @entity18 councillor @entity1 , who put forward the motion , claimed people in rural areas were ' travelling very minor roads … with very little traffic ' and ' have never killed anyone			1
' the motion was passed by @entity26 , in south - west @entity7 , on monday by five votes to three , with the remainder of the councillors either absent or abstaining			1
three of those who voted in favour of mr @entity1 's proposal are also believed to be publicans			1
the approved motion will now be considered by minister for justice @entity36 who will then decide whether or not to take the issue up with government			1
mr @entity1 claimed his proposal would bring back a social outlet for lonely people in rural areas that has been lost after more strict drink - drive laws were introduced			1
in his proposal outline he wrote : ' to ask the minister for justice to introduce legislation to allow @entity46 to issue permits to people living in rural isolated areas to allow them to drive home from their nearest pub after having two or three drinks on little used roads driving at very low speeds - to be issued at the discretion of the local @entity46			1
' this would greatly benefit people living alone looking at four walls and restore some bit of social activity in local pubs and may also help prevent depression and suicide			0

@entity64 is ranked among the highest alcohol consuming countries in the @entity75 ( @entity76 , 2007 ) he told the @entity18 : ' they 're travelling in very minor roads , often on tractors , with very little traffic and it 's not right they 're being treated the same as the rest of the travelling public and they have never killed anyone			0
' the only outlet they have then is to take home a bottle of whiskey and they 're falling into depression and suicide for some of them is the sad way out , ' he added			0
road safety chiefs attacked the ' off - the - wall ' motion that would serve only to drag the country back to ' a much darker day			0
' the head of @entity7 's @entity101 , @entity102 , expressed disbelief at the proposal			2
he said most of the country 's deaths and injuries from road accidents were in fact in rural areas			2
' there is very strong evidence which makes an irrefutable link between the consumption of alcohol and impairment , ' mr @entity102 said			0

for those that live in @entity12 ( pictured ) , mr @entity1 said : ' they 're travelling on very minor roads , often on tractors , with very little traffic and it 's not right they 're being treated the same as rest of the public ' ' i think we need to proceed with that and continue with the life - saving policies that we have in place			1
' describing the motion as ' off - the - wall ' , mr @entity102 paid tribute to @entity7 motorists for a sea change in attitudes and behaviour towards drink - driving that had made a significant dent in road deaths over recent years			1
' that is what is saving lives and proposals such as this bring us back to a much darker day , ' he said			0
@entity158 councillor @entity157 said she did not want to be associated with the motion			0
it ’s not caused by not being able to go to the pub. there ’s more things in @entity166 than go into your pub , ' she told mr @entity1			1

' we need constructive solutions to help those people , such as greater investment in community resources , and socialising is an important part of this , but alcohol does not have to be			0
' mr @entity180 added that alcohol will exacerbate , not alleviate , mental health difficulties such as depression or anxiety			0
