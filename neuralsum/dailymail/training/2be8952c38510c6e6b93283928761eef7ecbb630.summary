a craze for exotic pet newts has spread a deadly infection from @entity4 to @entity5 that could threaten to wipe out native amphibian species unless action is taken , scientists have warned			1
one of the creatures most at risk from the fungal disease is the great crested newt , already an endangered and protected species in the @entity13			1
the skin - eating fungus , @entity16 , is believed to have originated in south - east @entity4 , where indigenous newts and salamanders are immune to its effects			2
one of the types found to be most at risk is the great crested newt ( pictured ) , which is already endangered but it is lethal to @entity5 and @entity24 species , which have evolved no resistance to the disease			1
last year researchers learned the fungus was responsible for a mystery outbreak in the @entity30 that killed off 96 per cent of the country 's fire salamanders			0
experts now fear an expanding epidemic that has parallels with the human @entity37 crisis			2
as with @entity37 , the salamander fungus is transmitted by direct contact , and there is a danger of it being exported globally on international flights			0
experts fear an epidemic similar to the human ebola crisis , as the infection is spread by direct contact in this case , it is the pet trade that may have to face controls to prevent the infection spreading , say the authors of a new study assessing the threat			1
@entity4 salamanders and newts that could be harbouring the fungus are traded in large numbers around the world			0
between 2001 and 2009 , more than 2.3 million @entity61 fire belly newts were imported into the @entity24 alone			0
researchers from @entity63 , who have already identified two cases in @entity5 , want tighter controls on pet imports to be introduced urgently .			0

craze for pet newts led to fears it could *destroy* native species
one of the types most at risk is the great crested newt , which is already endangered in the @entity13
experts now fear an epidemic similar to the human ebola crisis
