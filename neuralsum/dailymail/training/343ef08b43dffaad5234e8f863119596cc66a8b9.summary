by @entity0 published : 05:52 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 05:08 est , 6 september 2012 the number of homes where no one works has fallen by nearly a quarter of a million over the past two years , figures showed yesterday			1
it means more people are taking jobs rather than living on state benefits , suggesting the @entity10 ’s welfare reforms may be having an effect			2
work and pensions secretary @entity12 has tried to cut back on the misuse of disability and sickness benefits and has capped @entity16 , while trying to get those dependent on benefits into the job market			0
the figures , from the @entity21 , show that the number of households living on benefits has fallen to its lowest level since the recession began to bite four years ago			1
never worked households : official figures show this number has nearly always gone up for 16 years and is currently at 340,000 in 2012 the number of jobless households in april , may and june was down 153,000 on the same period last year and was 244,000 fewer than the spring of 2010			1
but there were still 3,676,000 jobless households in the period , according to the figures			2
some 17.9 per cent of all homes now have no one with a job , down from 19.2 per cent when the @entity10 came to power			0
but five million adults still live in homes without work			0
around 1.75million children lived in households where no one worked , 60,000 fewer than last year			2
and the number of homes – apart from student households – where no one has ever had a job fell to 265,000 , down 26,000 from last spring			2
excluding student households , where everyone is aged 16 to 24 and in full - time education , there were 265,000 households containing only people that have never worked			2
this represents 1.3 per cent of all households in the @entity57			0
war of words : @entity60 , left , says that the government is not getting to grips with unemployment but minister @entity64 , right , says that it shows the @entity10 's benefits reforms are working experts warn that the issue often leads to social problems as families with no history of work are most likely to be involved in crime and their children are most likely to slip into a cycle of truancy , drug abuse and disorder			2
@entity78 told @entity79 today that the @entity61 was failing to get to grips with the problem			1
shadow employment secretary @entity60 said : ' today ’s slight fall in the number of workless households is welcome but after two years of failure this government is barely scratching the surface of @entity57 ’s jobs crisis			1
' there are still far too many workless households but ministers seem incapable of getting to grips with the problem			1
their back to work schemes are n’t delivering and our economy remains stuck in a double dip recession of this government ’s making			0
' shock : @entity57 's dole queue is dropping slowly but there is a worrying number of households where none of the residents have ever had a job overall , official @entity61 figures released today show the number of households where there are no people in employment , including those who have worked previously , has gone down by 0.8 per cent			1
the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) said this was 3.7 million in 2012 - down 153,000 on a year earlier			0
but it is still higher than the pre-recession level of 3.4 million			0
depressing : @entity21 figures show here the number of households containing whole families who have never had a job it means almost one in five homes have no employed adults			1
sickness continues to be the main reason for being out of work in the long - term			0
the government said today that these drops showed their welfare reforms are working			0
@entity64 , the employment minister , said : ' these are encouraging figures			2
through our welfare reforms more people are entering the workplace and more children are living in a household that works			1
' however , we ca n't be complacent			0
the economy remains a substantial challenge , which is why we need the right employment support to ensure that those living in workless households and their children are given the opportunities and help to succeed			1
' the data also reveals a worrying north - south divide , where in some areas up to a quarter of households are out of work			1
the @entity152 had the highest rate of workless households at 24.5 per cent , while the @entity155 had the lowest at 14.1 per cent			1
for the @entity57 as a whole in 2012 , around 17.9 per cent of households were in that position , but seven areas of the @entity57 that were above that average			0
' there are some stark differences across the country			0
for example , in the north - east of the country , 24.5 per cent of households are workless and in the south - east , just over 14 % , ' @entity21 expert @entity169 said			1
out of work : the majority of people who are long - term unemployed are suffering from health problems the latest data released by the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) also showed that the number of households where all adults that live in it work has also fallen			2
from april to june this year there were 10.9 million such households , representing 53 per cent and a fall of 36,000 of homes with at least one person aged 16 to 64 where all adult members are in employment			0
during the same period there were 3.7 million @entity57 households with at least one member aged 16 to 64 where no one was in work , representing 17.9 per cent of households			0
this was the second consecutive fall , compared to 2010 when almost four million @entity57 households had no adults in work			0
sickness , both long - term and temporary , was the main reason given for not working by those people aged 16 to 64 living in workless households , accounting for 1.45 million or around three in every 10 workless people			1
the second most common reason given was being unemployed , accounting for 1.03 million , or around one in five			0
the next three most common reasons were looking after the family , retirement and study			0
north - south divide : the north - east has the highest number of unemployed households , many more than in the south if fully retired and student households are removed , the number of households in the @entity57 that are workless goes down to 2.92 million			1
the @entity21 said there was a rise of 246,000 in mixed households - those containing some people in work and some who are not			2
the number stood at 5.97 million , or 29.1 % of the total			0
the lowest number of workless households was in 2006 , two years before the economic downturn hit the @entity57			1
then the number of workless households was 3.4 million or 17.3 % - 0.6 % lower than this year .			1

this figure is almost double the amount in 1996 , official figures show
out of *500,000* living in these households there are *250,000* children
overall workless household figures , which include those who have had jobs , have dropped by 0.8 % to 3.7m , still *300,000* above the pre-recession figure
most of these are in north - east @entity246 , while the least are in the south - east
' there are still far too many workless households but ministers seem incapable of getting to grips with the problem , ' @entity78 tell @entity79
@entity255 minister @entity254 says ' more people are entering the workplace and more children are living in a household that works '
