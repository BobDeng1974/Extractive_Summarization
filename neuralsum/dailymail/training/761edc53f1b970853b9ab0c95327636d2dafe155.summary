nine batsmen with at least one test century were packed into @entity3 ’s @entity2 team but they could not prevent a quite pathetic collapse on friday that exposed the depths to which a side bereft of all confidence have plummeted			2
a middle session as bad as any in @entity3 ’s miserable last nine months saw six wickets fall on a first @entity11 pitch that remained a lifeless strip of dirt that any self - respecting batsman would want to dig up and carry around with them			1
only a late rally from @entity17 and then @entity18 saved @entity3 from total humiliation but they have much to do if they are to leave one of their most productive grounds still level in a series @entity24 can not afford to lose			1
yet , from the soporific strength of 134 for one and what seemed a certain draw , suddenly and shamefully @entity3 fell apart against an @entity53 team who have not won a single test away from home in more than three years			2
yes , @entity57 was the victim of a quite appalling piece of umpiring from @entity60 , supposedly the @entity61 ’s finest , and @entity45 may have been unlucky to be given out lbw in this @entity64 - free @entity63 series			0
and , yes , @entity27 ’s bowlers have much more experience of the sort of sub-continental conditions gifted to them here in @entity68 rather than the alien ones they are usually confronted with outside their own country			0
but an @entity3 team who have simply forgotten how to win have no excuses for failing to cope with an attack that , like @entity76 ’s before them , should not pose the problems that @entity79 ’s did during the horror winter			0
there were no demons in this pitch and there should not have been anything to fear in a bowling line - up consisting of three seamers only just the right side of medium pace , a trundler and @entity27 ’s second choice spinner			0
yet as soon as @entity27 managed to get an out of shape ball changed just after @entity45 appeared to get an inside edge onto pad when given lbw the whole complexion of the match and possibly the series dramatically changed			1
five more wickets crashed in an afternoon session where @entity3 lost six in all while scoring 74 runs after compiling 88 without loss during the morning			1
it was awful stuff that seemed to stun the usually supportive @entity2 crowd			0
short stay : @entity107 lasted just two balls after having a nibble at one and being caught behind controversial : @entity57 ( right ) was given out caught behind despite the bat being nowhere near the ball the keys to a stunning transformation were the replacement ball that swung much more than the original one and the sudden unexpected burst into life of the erratic but sometimes brilliant @entity25			0
when @entity25 is bad he is terrible but when he gets it right he can be a formidable proposition and here he began the collapse with a spell of three wickets that ripped the heart out of this vulnerable and fragile @entity3 side			1
it was @entity25 who had trapped @entity45 , with the help of what looked like a mistake by @entity132 , and he followed it up by ensuring that @entity134 was denied a century and @entity135 was once again cut off in his prime			1
safe hands : @entity138 ( right ) takes a catch to dismiss @entity140 ( below ) after the ball hit his glove not showing him much glove : @entity140 is hit on the hand by a short ball and caught in the slips neither here nor there : @entity135 tries to pull his bat out of the way but nicks a delivery from @entity25 jubilation : @entity25 is elated after taking the prized wicket of @entity135 @entity135 must be considered culpable in @entity3 ’s demise			1
it was his strangled dismissal at @entity155 that sparked @entity76 into life and now he found a way of getting out just when he seemed poised for a big and vital contribution			0
@entity3 desperately need their senior players to stand up and be counted while the many promising newcomers adapt to their surroundings yet @entity135 fell just as disappointingly as his captain had on thursday when he tried to withdraw his bat and got the faintest of edges through to @entity166			1
worse , much worse , was to come for @entity3 as @entity27 warmed to their task , pitched the ball up to batsmen who prefer the back foot and used the short ball sparingly and hugely effectively , notably when @entity140 gloved to slip			2
oh no ! @entity44 can not believe it as he is dismissed for 71 you 've got to go : @entity45 ( left ) looks aghast as @entity25 celebrates taking the first wicket of the day halfway there : @entity134 raises his bat to salute reaching 50 prior was the man who would either come to the rescue or take the game away from opponents during @entity3 ’s glory years but he was denied the chance to do so here by an unforgivable error by @entity185			1
@entity166 , who captained his side brilliantly , stood up to @entity187 and appealed loudly when a noise accompanied @entity57 ’s play and miss to earn the decision from @entity191			0
yet @entity57 's bat was fully six inches away from the ball and the sound was him clipping his pad			0
it is @entity27 who arrogantly refuse to use the @entity64 and it cost them on the second day when @entity198 was wrongly given lbw by @entity132			0
yet now it was to favour them outrageously as @entity60 raised his finger and seriously weaken the arguments of those of us who regret the advance of technology in officiating			0
there was no doubt that @entity107 touched it two balls later – @entity166 was by now standing back again – and from nowhere @entity3 were 202 for seven and in serious danger of being asked to follow on by a rampaging @entity27			2
that they avoided that possibility was down to a bristling @entity17 , who hit 47 off 42 balls , and then the second productive last wicket partnership of the match that stands at an unbroken 54 even though @entity213 was struck a nasty blow on his hand			2
@entity18 , who started tentatively but grew into the challenge , remains on 78 and is the only one of @entity3 ’s nine @entity11 centurions who can be absolved of blame			1
yet @entity3 are still 105 behind and it now looks certain that this will be their ninth successive test without a win			2
and that is an unacceptable sequence			0
watching brief : @entity24 , out cheaply on thursday , looks on from the balcony well - alnaced : @entity3 no 3 @entity134 clatters a short ball through the leg - side getting behind it : @entity45 plays a straight ball on its merits at the start of the day all - rounder : @entity17 showed his batting ability on his way to 47 on day three dejected : @entity17 reacts after being dismissed lbw off the bowling of @entity187 @entity239 ! : no 11 @entity213 showed confidence with the bat reverse sweeping @entity37			1
