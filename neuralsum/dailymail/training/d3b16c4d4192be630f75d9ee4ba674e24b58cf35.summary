by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:55 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 20:51 est , 29 january 2013 she 's normally known for her combative interviewing style , but @entity5 radio presenter @entity4 was left shrieking in fear when a surprise studio guest made an appearance yesterday			1
@entity5 5 live lunchtime presenter @entity9 started screaming and leapt on her chair live on air after a guest spotted a mouse running around the studio			1
the 47 - year - old was interviewing @entity17 from drugs charity @entity18 live on air at the @entity5 's @entity22 studio just before 1pm when her guest spotted the unwelcome rodent			1
' the brazen mouse was clearly not as afraid of @entity9 as she was of it as it ran onto the desk and across her hand			2
the usually calm and composed presenter became upset and changed studio following the incident			0
mr @entity17 told her that he had seen the rodent when he faltered as he answered a question and she asked if there was something wrong			0
' @entity60 , oh , oh how horrible , ' screamed miss @entity4			1
' oh gosh sorry i 'm live on the radio squealing and kneeling on my chair because there 's a mouse in the room			1
' i thought you were unwell			0
i 'm going to leave it there because i am not sure i can continue interviewing in a a serious manner when i know there is a mouse scurrying around my feet			2
' shock : miss @entity4 expressed her embarrassment at having screamed on air and briefly regained her composure before squealing in fear again drama : workers looked around the studio for the mouse but were unable to find it , prompting miss @entity4 to move studios miss @entity4 appeared to regain her composure , telling listeners : ' i 'm just about ok , but these feet are n't touching the ground , i 've got big boots on as well , there 's no way this mouse could do me harm , it 's quite ridiculous			1
' she started screaming again moments later when the mouse was spotted again , begging others in the studio to get rid of the animal			2
she said : ' if it walks on my hand i 'm resigning			0
it 's on the bloody table			2
' presenter : @entity5 's @entity4 was caught unawares by the rodent as it made an appearance in her @entity107 studio miss @entity4 was then forced to move studio in the middle of her programme after the mouse walked over her hand off air			1
at the end of her show , she told @entity5 5 live colleague @entity115 : ‘ i was in the other studio as normal earlier on and at two minutes to one , one of my guests just went “ huh ” and clutched his chest , i thought “ oh my god , he ’s having a heart attack ” , and i said “ are you ok ? ” , and he said , “ i ’ve just seen a mouse ” and pointed to the little holes in the desk from where various wires come , and there was a little mouse sitting in there			1
' i squealed and put my feet up on the chair as i did not want them on the floor			0
' but the floor was not the issue and the mouse was then on the table and came across my hand			2
’ she added : ‘ i ’m off to breathe deeply and recover from the mouse incident , eugh			2
’ hours after the incident , staff had still been unable to capture the mouse			1
newsreader @entity146 told listeners : ‘ he could be anywhere			0
someone was trying to catch him in a coffee cup with a lid but failed			0
the mouse is on the loose			0
’ the mouse was spotted in the @entity157 's new multi-million pound home which only opened its doors back in 2011			2
miss @entity4 is not the first @entity5 presenter to be startled by a mouse live on air			1
just last month @entity163 weather girl @entity162 was reading out a bulletin on the @entity166 breakfast show when she spotted a rodent in the studio			0
she said : ' we could be seeing gale force winds from time to time during the afternoon			0
' the good news is it will start to ... @entity172			0
sorry there 's a mouse just run past me in my studio			2
' the @entity5 's relocation to @entity22 has been the subject of widespread criticism , with high - ranking members of staff questioning the need for the huge expenditure on the move			1
the luxurious new base at @entity107 , which houses programmes such as @entity187 and @entity188 , cost £ 200 million , with huge amounts of extra expenditure on staff relocation and transport between @entity193 and @entity194			0
the director general of @entity197 has still not purchased a home in the north , despite claiming that he would relocate close to the @entity22 base in 2010 , it was revealed yesterday			0
ridiculous : following the ordeal , miss @entity4 told listeners that her reaction was ' ridiculous ' as here 's no way this mouse could do me harm ' terrified : @entity5 5 live presenter was visibly frightened by the rodent studio : the @entity5 's new @entity107 development in @entity193 asked at a conference whether he had purchased a home in the region , he said : ‘ i do n’t think it is about whether people buy			1
it is about your commitment			0
my intention is still to buy up there			0
’ @entity224 has previously defended staff who have come under fire for living in @entity194 and working at the @entity228 site in @entity22 , such as @entity5 ’s @entity229 , after it emerged that during some periods just 60 per cent of her shows were broadcast from the @entity233			1
around 850 @entity5 staff have been given a total of £ 11 million to cover the costs of moving , as well as one - off payouts worth 10 per cent of their salary , to encourage them to move north from @entity194			1
another 1,000 people will move to the £ 180m hq in the future , sending costs spiralling even further , according to reports			0
