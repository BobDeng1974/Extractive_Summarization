by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity2 released so - called ' criminal aliens ' – people living in the @entity1 illegally who have been convicted of crimes – at a record pace in 2013			1
@entity9 documents obtained by the right - leaning @entity10 show that last year the agency 's @entity12 division encountered 722,000 potentially deportable illegal immigrants , but charged just 195,000 with immigration violations			1
and 68,000 of those who were released back in to the @entity1 population already had criminal convictions that would warrant their expulsion from the country			0
but president @entity23 's preferred policy has favored ' prosecutorial discretion , ' giving @entity12 broad authority to pick and choose which aliens to keep and which to cut loose			1
coming home to roost ? immigration protesters like this group in @entity31 have pushed for policy changes that give special treatment to illegal immigrants in a broad list of categories , inevitably letting countless genuine criminals slip through the cracks president @entity23 has presided over a policy shift that has given his homeland security agency ' prosecutorial discretion ' in handling illegal immigrants , a policy many @entity40 believe is intended to make citizenship options the only viable alternative @entity12 keeps some of them in detention facilities , but releases others who fit their ' discretion ' guidelines despite their criminal profiles			1
about 75 per cent of those detained by @entity12 in 2013 had already been convicted or criminal or immigration crimes serious enough to require them – by law – to remain in custody			1
most of those criminal aliens found themselves in @entity12 's holding cells after local authorities jailed them pending trial for unrelated offenses			2
many of those who were ultimately released never returned to face their immigration cases or other criminal charges , instead fleeing to other jurisdictions or back to their home countries			2
the @entity10 report claims that ' [ a ] ccording to @entity12 personnel , the vast gap between the number of encounters reported and the number of aliens put on the path to removal exists because officers are not permitted to file charges against aliens who do not fall into the administration ’s narrowly defined criteria for enforcement , regardless of the criminal charges or the circumstances in which the alien was identified			1
' @entity31 @entity88 sen. @entity88 , a frequent immigration hawk who opposes loosening policies and putting illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship , lashed out at the @entity94 on monday			1
' the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that immigration enforcement in @entity1 has collapsed , ' @entity88 said			0
' even those with criminal convictions are being released			0
@entity2 is a department in crisis			2
secretary @entity101 must reject the president ’s demands to weaken enforcement further and tell him that his duty , and his officers ’ duty , is to enforce the law – not break it			0
' he added a charge that the @entity23 administration has ' adopted a government policy that encourages new arrivals to enter illegally or overstay visas by advertising immunity from future enforcement			0
' @entity118 nationals and people from other countries continue to cultivate new ways to sneak into the @entity1 , often for work			0
this trio was spotted hiding in a storage compartment under the bed of a recreational vehicle			0
' the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that immigration enforcement in @entity1 has collapsed , ' says @entity31 @entity88 senator @entity88 according to @entity2 , more than 870,000 illegal immigrants are on lists ordering their deportation , but have defied authorities by becoming fugitives			1
in one infamous case , @entity136 police arrested @entity138 , a @entity118 national whose final charging sheet accused him of sexual assault involving a minor less than thirteen years old , sexual relations with a family member , and forcible sexual assault			1
@entity138 still stands charged with multiple counts of child rape against a member of his own family			2
@entity12 let him go under a policy that affords preference to illegal immigrants who are responsible for the care of minor children			1
the 42 charges were n't all filed immediately , so a judge granted him a $ 100,000 bond			0
a friend bailed him out for $ 10,000 , but @entity12 took custody			2
seeing that he was officially a caregiver for a minor child – one of the categories of prosecutorial discretion in the @entity94 's guidelines – the agency released him with a summons to appear in immigration court later			1
that minor was likely the young child @entity169 allegedly raped			0
he never returned to face his charges , either in criminal court or in immigration proceedings			2
the case of @entity175 , @entity173 is indicative of nationwide problems , but @entity12 agents face an extra hurdle there : since @entity136 declared itself a ' sanctuary ' city in 2011 , the @entity179 has closed its doors to federal immigration authorities			1
the @entity184 reported in 2012 that federal agents can no longer interview the county jail 's inmates to determine whether they should be flagged for ' removal ' – deportation i or other immigration proceedings			1
@entity192 , a @entity136 - area illegal immigrant who with a drunk driving conviction already on his record , fled that year to avoid facing a felony charge of vehicular homicide			1
charging documents showed that @entity192 was drunk when he plowed his car into a 66 - year - old man who was crossing the street , dragging him about two hundred feet			0
@entity12 placed a ' detainer ' on @entity192 after he was jailed , ordering his continued detention even if he made bail			2
but @entity175 ignored the directive			0
when @entity192 found enough money to post bond five months after his arrest , he walked out of the jail , never to return			0
immigration officials have complained about a lack of bed space in detention facilities for the annual crush of detainees they process			0
but for the last three years , the @entity2 has consistently decreased the number of beds covered in its annual budget requests			0
the @entity219 reported monday that ' despite claims of a focus on public safety , the administration ’s prosecutorial discretion criteria are allowing factors such as family relationships , political considerations , or attention from advocacy groups to trump criminal convictions as a factor leading to deportation			0

the @entity2 is letting illegal immigrants go in record numbers , *including* those already convicted of serious crimes
a man accused of raping a child in his own family was released , apparently because of a policy of ' discretion ' when *suspects* are child caregivers
another man facing vehicular homicide charges walked away because @entity136 's county jail officials refused to let the feds interview him
according to a new report , just 195,000 out of 722,000 illegal immigrants encountered by @entity12 were charged with immigration violations in 2013
