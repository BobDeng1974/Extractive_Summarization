by @entity0 , political editor last updated at 11:34 am on 8th september 2011 the 50p top rate of tax looks certain to be abolished for high earners by 2013 , while tax breaks are to be accelerated for millions at the other end of the income scale			1
in tandem with a move to scrap the rate , chancellor @entity7 is expected to speed up moves to raise the threshold at which income tax kicks in to £ 10,000			1
a senior cabinet minister admitted yesterday the supertax is doing ‘ more harm than good ’			0
well - timed intervention ? @entity18 said he backed calls to scrap the 50p tax rate on incomes over £ 150,000 as @entity7 faced more pressure to act communities secretary @entity18 spoke out after 20 of @entity24 ’s leading economists called on mr @entity7 to scrap the tax , introduced by @entity26 at the height of the financial crisis			1
but shadow chancellor @entity29 claimed a temporary cut in the vat rate to cut prices at the checkout would be more likely to kick start the economy			1
in a joint letter yesterday , 20 leading economists – including former @entity39 @entity38 members dr @entity36 and dr @entity40 – warned that @entity24 now has one of the highest personal tax regimes in the industrialised world			2
this makes it ‘ less competitive internationally , and making us less attractive as a destination for both foreign investment and talented workers ’ , they wrote			0
mr @entity7 describes the tax , levied on income over £ 150,000 , as a ‘ temporary measure ’			1
there is growing speculation that in his @entity56 next spring he will announce the 50p rate is to be scrapped the following year			2
but abolishing a levy which affects only the wealthiest 320,000 people in @entity24 will be fraught with political danger			0
is it worth scrapping the 50p tax rate to boost the economy ? the chancellor has commissioned research into whether the tax loses more revenue than it brings in by driving wealth creators away and encouraging tax evasion			1
mr @entity18 said : ‘ there is a strong case to say [ the 50p tax rate ] is n’t actually contributing very much and on balance is probably doing more damage than good			1
’ @entity75 sources said their price for agreeing to abolish the tax would be an alternative tax on the wealthy			2
business secretary @entity79 is pushing to revive his idea of a ‘ mansion tax ’ on homes worth more than either £ 1million or £ 2million			1
but @entity75 colleagues say that is unlikely to be approved by mr @entity7 and are working on proposals for alternative taxes on the wealthy once the 50p rate is scrapped			2
‘ we are not ideologically wedded to the 50p tax rate , but when you ’re saying everyone must pay their share you do have to ensure that means everyone , ’ said one			1
keep 50p tax : shadow chancellor @entity29 said the government would be better off cutting the rate of @entity99 to boost economic growth the 50p tax affects nearly 320,000 taxpayers – 1 per cent of the total number of taxpayers			1
they contribute 24 per cent of income tax raised by the government , according to @entity107 figures			1
former conservative cabinet minister @entity108 said scrapping the 50p rate would actually lead to an increase in the overall tax take from high - earners			1
he added : ‘ unless we get more money out of the rich we are not going to get the deficit down			0
’ @entity75 peer @entity116 said cutting the 50p tax rate was ‘ the last thing we want to do ’			1
‘ if you have any money for tax cuts , you do n’t give it to the top one per cent of people , who tend to actually save quite a lot of it			2
it should be given to those at the bottom , to raise the tax - free allowance up to £ 10,000 , because people in that situation will go out and spend it in the shops			1
’ @entity26 ’s shadow chancellor @entity29 told @entity133 that the government would be better off cutting vat			1
' if you really want to get spending and purchasing power into the economy quickly , rather than doing it through personal allowances , which tends to be a bit diffuse , better to have a temporary cut in vat because a cut in @entity99 puts money into people 's pockets straight away			2
it will have more of an impact upon the economy , ' he said			0
' but to be honest , if he was to do personal allowances rather than @entity99 it would be such a change of direction			0
' a @entity155 spokesman said : ‘ the 50p rate is a temporary measure			2
the government is committed to a competitive tax system , but in reducing the deficit , we have always been clear those with the broadest shoulders should carry the greatest burden			0
’ talks : @entity166 accidentally showed off the paperwork as she left @entity168 the chief executive of @entity170 was photographed in @entity168 yesterday with papers suggesting she had been tipped off that banking reforms would be delayed			0
@entity173 @entity166 had been for private talks with the chancellor @entity7 ahead of the release of a report by the @entity177 into the future of the industry			0
the @entity177 is expected to call for banks to be ring - fenced , separating their ‘ casino - banking ’ investment divisions from the retail divisions			0
but miss @entity166 had a document which stated : ‘ it will take a significant amount of time before any changes ( from the @entity177 report ) are legislated			0
’ there has been mounting speculation that the reforms will be shelved until at least 2015 because of warnings from banks that they could trigger another downturn			0
it came as business secretary @entity79 holds a meeting today with smaller banks , such as @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 , to discuss how the @entity200 can make it ‘ easier ’ for new banks to establish themselves in the @entity24			0
blunders with documents outside @entity204 are not unusual , and miss @entity166 is in good company			0
development secretary @entity206 last week risked a diplomatic row when he accidentally showed off a secret @entity158 memo welcoming the departure of @entity211 's president @entity210			0
close - up : the document 's key passage suggests miss @entity166 had been tipped off that banking reforms would be delayed			0

@entity18 says the tax ' is *n't* contributing very much '
@entity29 claims vat cut would give a bigger boost than axing the 50p tax band
