chased : @entity0 spent £ 200,000 pursuing @entity1 for a £ 2000 council tax bill a ' blinkered and aggressive ' local authority spent £ 200,000 chasing a schizophrenic pensioner over an unpaid council tax bill after ' ignoring ' the fact he was mentally ill. @entity0 splashed out £ 50,000 in legal costs alone pursuing vulnerable @entity1 for a bankruptcy order over the unpaid bill of less than £ 2,000			1
the @entity12 local authority wrongly ignored the fact mr @entity1 , 80 , was schizophrenic and has dementia in chasing him over the payment , a judge ruled today			1
the ruling means @entity0 now have to pay trustee fees of £ 70,000 and pay mr @entity1 's legal costs , which solicitors estimate will amount to a further £ 80,000			1
those figures takes the total council spend to an astonishing £ 200,000 - more than a hundred times what mr @entity1 owed in council tax			2
a district judge ruled the authority did not show compassion towards mr @entity1 in pursuing the ' disproportionate ' legal action			2
district judge @entity29 said in her ruling that @entity31 , the council 's tax manager , had ' demonstrated a lack of understanding ' when he said in a statement that there was ' no indication that mr @entity1 was suffering from a mental illness ' and he was ' under no duty to make detailed inquiries about mr @entity1 ' health '			1
the judge added : ' the court is satisfied that it is more likely than not that when the bankruptcy order was made , mr @entity1 was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and vascular dementia and that by reason of those mental disorders he lacked capacity			1
' the council could have shown compassion for him [ mr @entity1 ] even if it did not accept the legal arguments advanced on his behalf			2
' purely on economic grounds it is not proportionate to have pursued mr @entity1 for £ 1,909 and to have incurred what is likely to be in excess of £ 100,000 of costs and expenses			0
' legal representatives for mr @entity1 had previously argued that mr @entity1 's illness made it very difficult for him to deal with his own financial matters			1
the pensioner , who lives in @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity12 , was made bankrupt in 2004 after his debt problems mounted when he neglected to pay a council tax bill totalling £ 1,900			0
barrister @entity70 , representing mr @entity1 , said at a previous hearing that @entity0 showed a ' blinkered and aggressive ' attitude in pursuing the debt and pushing for the bankruptcy order			1
the council insists its insurance will cover the costs and the taxpayer will not be affected			0
it does admit that its insurance premium has gone up , but says this is by a ' negligible ' amount			0
a council spokesman said : ' the council now accepts that mr @entity1 lacked capacity at the time he was made bankrupt and apologises to him for any distress caused			1
' at that time , the council was not aware of any issues surrounding mr @entity1 's mental health , and if it had been made aware of these issues , it is unlikely that the action would have been pursued			1
' the council says it has put in place measures to prevent known vulnerable people facing similar problems			0
but a spokesman added : ' the council is concerned about the implications of the judgement , because it has no means to assess the mental health of debtors where it is not told that there is a problem			0
' the council has been advised that there could be grounds for a positive appeal on this basis but has decided not to take this step because of the potential cost to the public purse and the further distress and uncertainty this may cause for mr @entity1			0
' @entity112 , solicitor for mr @entity1 , said : ' the council 's decision to make mr @entity1 bankrupt , for such a relatively small sum of money , and to carry on with this case for so many years demonstrates a worrying attitude towards vulnerable individuals			2
' mr @entity1 was lucky that help found him			0
however , i am sure that there are many other at - risk people who just slip through the net			0
' this case should act as a stark warning to others , including other local authorities , who might seek to make people bankrupt			0

@entity0 ' aggressive ' in chasing @entity1 , 80
@entity1 's illness ' made it difficult for him to deal with financial matters '
