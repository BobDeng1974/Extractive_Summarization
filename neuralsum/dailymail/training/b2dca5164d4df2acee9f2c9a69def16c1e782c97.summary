jailing him , district judge @entity26 said : ' i hope this is a big shock to you			0
having been given opportunities you still resorted to this type of wholly unacceptable , insidious and disrespectful behaviour			0
' he went on to say the women did n't know they were being spied on which made the case ' even more sinister '			2
as well as the ban on carrying any reflective item in public , @entity0 must surrender any recording device in his possession if asked to do so by the police			1
he must also pay an Â£ 80 victim surcharge			0

you have had opportunities to get help and treatment			0
' when you are confronted with difficulties you resort back to this behaviour			0
whatever difficulties you have there is no excuse for this type of behaviour			0
for women not knowing anything going on to be violated in this way is unacceptable			0
you have had opportunities to sort this out and you have done it again			0
