@entity0 said a @entity2 inquest should be held early so a family did n't go to the pub a solicitor who represented the families of @entity2 victims after the disaster told the coroner he thought his clients just ' wanted their 15 minutes of fame '			1
@entity0 , who was on the @entity12 , following the @entity14 semi-final where 96 fans died , argued for one inquest to be held at 9am to prevent the family of one victim from being able to ' go to the pub first ' , it has emerged			2
the victims ' families have now called for the lawyer to resign after the offensive comments came to light following further study of the newly published @entity27 report			1
the report also showed that mr @entity0 suggested the cut - off point for evidence should ' probably ' be nine minutes earlier than the 3.15pm time eventually imposed by coroner dr @entity30			1
several families wanted this cut - off point pushed back to allow for a thorough investigation			1
documents reveal mr @entity0 , who is now @entity35 ’s deputy coroner , told @entity36 and the coroner some families were ' hotheads '			1
the panel was critical of mr @entity0 , saying his behaviour suggested ' a surprisingly critical , if not contemptuous , view of some of the bereaved families whose interests he represented '			1
the comments were made in february 1990 when mr @entity0 met with the coroner , @entity36 and the force ’s lawyer @entity48 to decide on the format of inquests			1
a note disclosed to the panel of the meeting records mr @entity0 saying : ' there will be some families who want their , someone said , their 15 minutes of fame			1
' i suppose to some extent they are going to have to be given that opportunity are n’t they ? i think the vast majority will go through very smoothly but i think that there will be one or two who are going [ sic ] problems			0
' there will be one or two hotheads who will look for the ulterior motive behind this			0
the vast majority will accept it in the spirit in which it ’s done			0
the press will do the same			0
' later in the conversation mr @entity0 and the coroner discussed start times for inquests and he suggested one family should have an early start in the morning at 9am			1
the minutes quote him saying : ' there is one family who would swell the coffers of the local hostelry before they arrived			0
' today @entity87 , president of the @entity89 , who lost his daughters @entity91 , 15 , and @entity92 , 19 , at the tragedy said mr @entity0 should resign			2
he said : ' this is a form of betrayal , i am staggered			0
' he should consider his position			0
any credibility he might have had has gone out of the window			0
' i thought i was beyond shock after last week but i am so disappointed with him			0
' he said mr @entity0 was another name to add to the list of people who had let down the families of the 96			1
@entity2 victims ' families have called for lawyer @entity0 to resign after offensive comments came to light following more indepth study of the newly published @entity27 report @entity111 , of @entity112 , added : ' i was not impressed with his conduct at the inquests , i felt he was clearly out of his depth			1
' mr @entity0 represented the families while working for @entity119 - based @entity118 solicitors which he joined in 1982			1
he remains a senior lawyer at the firm			0
he became involved after mr @entity87 approached his then boss sir @entity123 , who was involved in the legal cases after the heysel disaster			0
sir @entity123 died and mr @entity0 took over the case			2
his profile on @entity130 ’s website boasts of his role in ' protecting the interests of those who had been bereaved or injured ' at the @entity2 disaster in 1989			0
in mid-september dr @entity30 wrote to the @entity12 to request details of witnesses the families wanted calling at the resumed inquests			0
ten days later dr @entity30 recorded a conversation with mr @entity0 in which the families ’ reactions to the interim inquest were discussed			1
@entity87 , president of the @entity89 , who lost his daughters @entity91 , 15 , and @entity92 , 19 , described mr @entity0 's comments as a form of betrayal the note of the meeting states mr @entity0 considered ' it [ mini-inquest stage ] went very well ' , finishing ' within a few minutes of the scheduled time over a two - and - a - half week period '			2
he stated that a ' few ' families , however , ' had expected more and they were not entirely happy with the way that he had asked any questions ... but he confirmed that the vast majority of families were very satisfied with the way the inquests had been done '			0
this was clearly not the view of the @entity89			0
the documents include minutes of a meeting between @entity89 and sir @entity163 , who had represented other families at another inquest on october 2 , 1990			2
at the meeting it was stated that the mini-inquests had been limited to ' who ' , ' when ' and ' where ' and ' nothing more apart from the alcohol levels was raised '			0
@entity89 representatives said dr @entity30 had been ' quite clearly aggressive ' towards families despite their ' polite ' requests for information on the organisation of the inquests			0
the @entity89 expressed concern about the power of the coroner , the lack of information received by families , that ' fundamental issues appertaining to this disaster ' would remain unresolved and about their lawyers ’ strength of commitment			2
according to dr @entity30 ’s notes on october 12 mr @entity0 informed him that , in fact , several families had ' some small queries on the individual inquests and [ asked ] was i proposing to deal with these and if so when '			2
dr @entity30 asked mr @entity0 if families ’ queries from the mini-inquests were substantial			2
mr @entity0 ' said he did n’t think so ... as far as he could recollect they were relatively minor matters '			2
in the same telephone conversation mr @entity0 suggested a 3.06pm cut - off for evidence			1
mr @entity0 told the coroner ahead of the inquests that ' there will be one or two hotheads who will look for the ulterior motive behind this ' dr @entity30 states in his note : ' i explained to him that i was not intending to go over all the ground of the rescue			1
' mr @entity213 [ sic ] agreed with this			0
he said he thought in his view probably six minutes past three was the cut - off point			1
' i said i felt that it might be a few minutes beyond that but that was basically what i had in mind			0
' dr @entity30 recorded having told mr @entity0 : ' i said that i thought that when we got down to it he would be quite satisfied indeed			1
' i had the feeling that we might be doing a more thorough job than he was expecting			0
' soon after , dr @entity30 announced he was imposing the 3.15pm cut - off point			1
a number of families then wrote to the @entity12 requesting the interim inquests be re-opened and the 3.15pm cut - off point be pushed back			1
mr @entity0 , who is now the deputy coroner for @entity35 , refused to comment .			2

@entity0 also told the coroner he thought some families were ' hotheads '
he suggested cut - off point for evidence should ' probably ' be even earlier than *planned*
@entity27 said it was ' a surprisingly critical , if not contemptuous , view of some of the bereaved families he represented '
families said they felt ' shocked ' and ' betrayed ' , others said he seemed ' out of his depth ' in court
