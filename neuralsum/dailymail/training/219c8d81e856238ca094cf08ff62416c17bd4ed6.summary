by @entity1 reporter published : 14:36 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 16:32 est , 23 may 2013 for a group of first responders who saved the life of a 2 - year - old horrifically maimed in a lawn mower accident last month , their recent reunion proved as much needed closure for them as well as her family			1
' i 'm not an emotional guy , but it 's awesome to see her doing so well , ' @entity15 @entity14 paramedic @entity13 told @entity19 after seeing @entity20 in @entity21 on wednesday			1
' it 's good closure for us , ' the 33 - year - old said , like so many of the other paramedics celebrating her miraculous recovery around him			2
@entity13 said he sat with co-workers sobbing in a church parking lot immediately after moving her into a bayflite helicopter that fateful day			2
he says he 's usually not prone to tears but @entity33 's terrifying injuries and near death really got the best of him			2
on wednesday @entity33 smiled and giggled in the arms of her mother and father during a special visit to the @entity64 headquarters in @entity21 to meet with her heroes after her hospital discharge earlier this month			1
it was on april 11th her mother , @entity32 , watched in terror as her daughter ran after her father , @entity72 , as he unsuspectingly rode a lawn mower up their driveway			1
recovery : @entity33 lost both her feet below the knees and also cut up her left hand and broke her thumb during the horrific accident in her front yard last month new friends : one of the many first responders cheerfully holds @entity33 in her arms as they lined up to eat together closure : the @entity72 family 's visit to the @entity64 headquarters in @entity21 on wednesday provided equal chance for the family to say thank you and for everyone who helped to receive some long - needed closure the mother , @entity32 , gestured for him to stop but he misunderstood her and instead put the vehicle in reverse - backing over his little girl			1
if it was n’t for people like her nextdoor neighbor , @entity102 , who ’s a nurse and was able to slow @entity33 ’s blood loss until paramedics arrived , her daughter - seen on wednesday wearing a red ribbon in her hair above an @entity108 flag dress – would n’t have survived			0
' i mean , i do n't think she understands any of this because she 's two and i think she 's happy to meet new friends , ' mrs @entity32 told @entity19 on wednesday			0
' but for me , it kind of brings a little closure to that night			0
' many thanks : @entity33 sits in the arms of her mother as her father talks with the first responders around him , men and women he owes his daughter 's life to ' we lose contact with patients once they are admitted into the hospital so it gives us a kind of chance to touch base with family and see that our work was n't in vain , ' @entity123 , a @entity124 nurse also told the website			1
@entity33 underwent seven surgeries after her legs were severed below the knees and she sustained cuts to her left hand			1
she also broke her thumb			0
mrs @entity143 credits everyone who helped saved her daughter as her personal heroes , as much as her daughter ’s			0
‘ they helped save my daughter , ’ she said			0
‘ they are a part of my family now			0
