by @entity0 published : 05:27 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 08:20 est , 7 september 2012 curiosity has taken its first sniff of @entity4 air as engineers begin testing all of its scientific instruments			1
the robot sucked the air into its big @entity8 at @entity4 ( @entity10 ) instrument , which is designed to reveal the concentration of different gases on the red planet			0
it is hoped the instrument will be able to find tiny traces of methane , a short lived gas , in the atmosphere			2
researchers will use a super-sensitive analysis machine to search for it			0
' when @entity10 is at its best it can measure various parts per trillion of methane , and the expected amounts based on measurements taken from orbit around @entity4 and from @entity41 telescopes should be in the 10 to a few 10s of parts per billion , ' said @entity1 deputy principal scientist @entity43			1
the gas has recently been observed by satellite and by @entity41 telescopes			0
it is the first time that the chemistry of the atmosphere has been tested from the surface of the planet since the @entity51 in the 1970s			1
it found @entity53 is the main component of @entity4 air			0
however , @entity55 says analysis may take a little more time			2
' it 's so early in the use of @entity10 , which is a complicated instrument , and we have to sort through the data , ' said @entity43			2
@entity55 engineers have also begun testing the rover 's robotic arm			1
@entity55 also released new engineering pictures showing the location of @entity1 's robot arm , which has five joints			1
' we will be putting the arm through a range of motions and placing it at important ' teach points ' that were established during @entity41 testing , such as the positions for putting sample material into the inlet ports for analytical instruments , " said @entity69 of @entity55 's @entity70 in @entity71			1
' these activities are important to get a better understanding for how the arm functions after the long cruise to @entity4 and in the different temperature and gravity of @entity4 , compared to earlier testing on @entity41			1
' since the @entity91 spacecraft placed @entity1 inside @entity4 ' @entity92 on aug. 5 , it has driven a total of 358 feet ( 109 meters )			2
the drives have brought it about one - fourth of the way from the landing site , named @entity97 , to a location selected as the mission 's first major science destination , @entity101			0
' we knew at some point we were going to need to stop and take a week or so for these characterization activities , ' said @entity70 's @entity105 , @entity1 mission manager			1
' for these checkouts , we need to turn to a particular angle in relation to the sun and on flat ground			0
' we could see before the latest drive that this looked like a perfect spot to start these activities			0
' the arm can be extended to pick up samples from the @entity4 surface			0

first time *martian* atmosphere has been tested since @entity51 in the 1970s
comes as engineers begin testing @entity1 's robotic arm
