by @entity1 reporter published : 09:01 est , 25 january 2014 updated : 11:02 est , 25 january 2014 a jury on friday rejected a defamation case against @entity5 over a @entity7 post that suggested one of her attorneys had been ' bought off ' for not pursuing a lawsuit over her late husband 's estate			1
the verdict came after roughly three hours of deliberation in a case that spanned eight days and focused on the @entity20 frontwoman 's postings on the social networking site			0
the case centered on one 2010 post that suggested that @entity25 attorney @entity24 had been ' bought off ' and that was why she was n't representing the singer anymore			2
the lawyer contended during the trial that she was fired by @entity5 and that the tweet and other statements the singer made against her have caused her substantial damage			1
@entity5 's tweet stated , ' i was ( expletive ) devastated when @entity46 of @entity25 was bought off ' in response to a question from user of the popular social media site			1
the message was never meant to be public , @entity5 told jurors			2
she said she meant for it to be sent as a direct message , which only the recipient would see , but it instead went public and was quickly deleted			0
the swift verdict was n't witnessed by @entity5 , who had left court after closing arguments ended friday morning			1
she arrived just as the courthouse was closing down and met her attorneys , @entity62 and @entity63 , in the hallway where she hugged them both			0
@entity5 praised her attorneys and the jury after the verdict			1
asked about her social media presence , @entity5 said she refrained from posting on @entity7 during the trial			2
' i did n't tweet out of respect for the case , ' she said			0
while the case was billed as the first ' @entity74 ' trial in which @entity7 and libel law intersected , @entity62 said it was tried by the same rules as traditional defamation cases			0
jurors determined that @entity5 's tweet included false information , but the musician did n't know it was n't true			1
first - ever : the ' @entity85 ' lawsuit was the first of it 's kind @entity24 attorney @entity87 said the jury 's verdict meant the panel determined @entity5 's statement was defamatory , but the singer could n't be held liable for it			1
@entity24 ' side asked the panel to award $ 8 million in damages and send a message that false statements online had consequences			0

' at the end of the day , her biggest asset in life is her reputation , ' @entity87 said			0
' that she got back today			0
' @entity5 's social media postings have gotten her into trouble several times			2
in 2011 , she agreed to pay $ 430,000 to fashion designer @entity110 over statements she posted on @entity7 and @entity112			0
@entity110 sued @entity5 again last year , alleging the musician libeled her when @entity5 accused @entity110 of theft on the @entity116 's radio show and taunted her on the social media site @entity117			2
the case is pending , but @entity5 said she 's trying to be more careful about her online musings than she was when she tweeted about @entity24			0
' i do n't tweet like i did back then , ' @entity5 said friday .			1
