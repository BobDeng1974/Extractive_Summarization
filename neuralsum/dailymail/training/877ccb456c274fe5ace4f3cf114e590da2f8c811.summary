by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 04:53 est , 26 december 2012 @entity1 on a @entity3 beach			0
now she is walking her new ambition is to learn how to drive a teenager who was told to get on with life in a wheelchair life because she would never walk again is now walking after a pioneering operation			1
@entity1 , from @entity3 , had been confined to a wheelchair since the age of 11 after being born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus ( water on the brain )			1
but children 's orthopaedic expert @entity16 was confident she could get @entity19 standing again			1
after a complex operation in july this year to lengthen the tight muscles at the hips , knees and feet , @entity19 amazed her family by standing up next to her hospital bed			1
supported by a nurse and her mother @entity28 , 52 , the teenager then walked around her ward and the nurses ' station at @entity32			2
the breakthrough was just 10 days before her 18th birthday and left @entity19 and her family with a double reason to celebrate			1
@entity19 , the youngest of five girls and two boys , said : ' when i was 11 , i was given an electric wheelchair and told to just get on with it			1
' after i met @entity16 , i agreed to let her do the op she suggested but i did n't really know if it would work			0
' walking again after my operation did not feel strange and it did n't hurt ; it just felt completely natural			1
' it has been a long road for @entity19 as she and her parents have made more than 500 return trips to @entity32 for treatment			1
she had already undergone 42 surgical procedures on her head , legs , back and stomach			0
@entity19 was born with spina bifida - a fault in the development of the spinal cord and surrounding bones ( vertebrae ) that had left a gap in her spine			2
she also developed the related condition hydrocephalus - where cerebro - spinal fluid does n't drain into the blood stream properly			0
she will still need to return to @entity32 for further treatment including having new splints fitted			2
her father @entity69 , 50 , said : ' we have been coming to @entity32 regularly since @entity19 was just a day old and have nothing but good things to say about it			1
' the staff have been brilliant and there are still one or two we remember from when we first came in all those years ago			0
' meanwhile , @entity19 is hoping to fulfil another dream - learning to drive			2
' @entity16 has given me the drive to go on and make all my dreams a reality and i now hope to begin to drive - and i 'm already saving for a car , ' she said			0
@entity19 with her mother @entity28 and father @entity69 : they have all been impressed with @entity19 's treatment at @entity32 @entity19 is one of 15 children and young people who have benefited from a pioneering accelerated rehabilitation programme developed by the hospital			1
the programme can see patients walking within six weeks of hip surgery through the use of a removable brace			0
conventionally , patients are placed in plaster shorts - known as a spica - for six to eight weeks			0
these hold the hip in place but limit movement , causing muscle wastage , delaying the start of therapy treatment and preventing them from standing for at least three months			0
under accelerated rehabilitation , patients are placed in their brace at night or during periods of rest following surgery , allowing early movement and standing to preserve muscle strength or comfortable seating			0
the programme is already helping young cerebral palsy patients as well as those with spina bifida , where a series of birth defects affect the development of the spine and nervous system			0
' it is fantastic to see children and young people like @entity19 to be up on their feet so soon after major invasive surgery - the early movement with the brace seems to be the key , ' said miss @entity16			2
' i am delighted for @entity19 and her family , especially as they thought she would never walk again			2

@entity19 was confined to a wheelchair aged 11 and told to ' just get on with it '
but expert at @entity32 was convinced she could get @entity19 standing again
days before 18th birthday @entity19 underwent a complex operation to lengthen the tight muscles at the hips , knees and feet
she can now walk and says it feels ' completely natural '
