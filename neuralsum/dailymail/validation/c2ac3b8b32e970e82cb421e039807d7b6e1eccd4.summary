@entity1 and the @entity2 are ' half way down the aisle ' to stitching up a deal to put @entity6 in @entity7 , the @entity0 claimed today after @entity8 dropped the party 's red line over nuclear weapons			1
ms @entity8 said the @entity2 would still be prepared to put mr @entity6 in @entity12 even if @entity1 refused to scrap @entity15 's @entity14 nuclear deterrent – a key plank of the nationalists ' manifesto			1
the @entity20 first minister said the @entity2 would never vote to renew @entity14 but she insisted there were ' many issues we could agree on '			1
ms @entity8 played down the prospects of a formal @entity25 , but said the @entity2 could prop up a @entity1 government ' on an issue - by - issue ' basis			1
@entity8 said the @entity2 could still do a deal with the @entity30 even if @entity6 insists on renewing @entity15 's @entity14 nuclear weapons she said : ' on that basis , there are many issues we could agree on which we would support but we would not vote for @entity14			1
' ms @entity8 's remarks , to the @entity36 , come amid growing pressure on mr @entity6 to rule out going into @entity25 with the @entity2 in a bid to stem the party 's loss of support in @entity20			1
@entity0 chairman @entity42 said ms @entity8 's move opened to door for a deal between @entity1 and the @entity2 after the election			1
he said : ' @entity6 and the @entity2 have signed the pre-nup and are now half - way up the aisle			2
' day after day , vote after vote in @entity51 , @entity6 would be forced to negotiate with @entity52 - the man who tried to break up @entity15 - about how to run @entity15			2
' make no mistake : an @entity6 government , propped up by the @entity2 , would mean more debt than our children could ever hope to repay , higher taxes on hardworking people and economic chaos for our country			2
' a @entity1 government propped up by the @entity2 - handing mr @entity6 the keys to @entity7 - moved a step closer after @entity8 dropped a red line over @entity14 nuclear weapons @entity20 will be able to ' call the tune ' at @entity68 after the general election , according to @entity52			1
the former first minister , who is standing for the @entity72 constituency in may , said neither @entity1 or the conservative ' are fit to govern ' and believes a large group of @entity75 will lead to ' progress for @entity20 '			2
working with @entity77 and the @entity78 , mr @entity52 hopes to ' shake @entity68 to its foundations , to rumble up the @entity80 '			0
speaking ahead of a constituency meeting in the village of @entity83 , @entity84 , he said : ' it is now clear that neither @entity0 or @entity1 will win an overall majority			2
neither are fit to govern			0
' it is also clear that @entity20 is swinging behind @entity2 candidates the length and breadth of the country			2
in that situation @entity20 can call the tune in the next @entity51			0
' now thoughts should turn to what that tune should be			0
@entity8 has laid out a clear strategy and key priorities			0
' we can not give any support formal or informal to the @entity0 because of their track record of hostility to @entity20 interests and the total bad faith of @entity107 towards the @entity20 people the day after the referendum			0
' however , support for any other administration comes with the conditon of progress for @entity20			0
' progress to fully deliver the promises on real powers that were made to the @entity20 people during the referendum			0
progress to signal an end to austerity economics with all the damage that this is doing to the country and finally common sense progress in stopping the waste of countless billions on new nuclear weapons			0
' it comes after a poll of marginal constituencies in @entity20 revealed that a dramatic surge by the @entity2 could see @entity1 lose almost 40 seats north of the border			1
the survey , by the @entity0 peer @entity134 , showed the @entity2 could win as many as 56 of @entity20 's 59 seats – up from just six at present			1
the @entity2 surge would claim seats held by a string of household names , including @entity140 , @entity141 and former @entity142 leader @entity142			0
the poll suggests that @entity1 and the @entity144 would end up being tied on 272 seats each – well short of the 326 needed to command a @entity147 majority			0
but a @entity1 government could be propped up by the @entity2 – handing mr @entity6 the keys to @entity7			1
however , @entity1 's @entity20 mps are urging mr @entity6 to rule out a deal with the @entity2 ahead of the election in an attempt to reverse his party 's dire poll ratings north of the border			1
@entity1 is holding its annual conference in @entity158 this weekend			0
former prime minister sir @entity159 has also warned @entity1 against doing a deal with the @entity2			1
sir @entity159 claimed ' the @entity2 would enter into any agreement with @entity1 with one overriding aim : to break up the @entity15 '			1
writing in the @entity164 , he said : ' @entity1 now have to make a choice			0
' they must summon the courage of their convictions and declare their intent			0
the @entity15 people – north and south of the border — do not deserve to be misled			0
@entity1 must remove any doubt			0
' if the outcome of the general election is inconclusive , will they refuse to govern with the support of a party whose principal aim is to break up the @entity15 ? ' the @entity2 said that @entity1 would ' not be forgiven by the people of @entity20 ' if they refused to work with the @entity180			1
deputy leader @entity181 said : ' for a former @entity0 prime minister to tell @entity1 what to do on the eve of their conference in @entity20 is hugely embarrassing for ( @entity1 ) @entity187			2
' @entity159 wants the @entity0 to be re-elected in may , and therefore he wants @entity1 to rule out an agreement with the @entity2 , because that would stop the @entity0			2
' ' there are no circumstances in which the @entity2 would put the @entity0 into government - the question is if @entity1 have the same commitment , with a number of senior @entity1 figures promoting voting @entity0 in @entity20 , and even the idea of a ' grand alliance ' between the @entity0 and @entity1 .			1
