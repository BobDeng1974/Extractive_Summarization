by @entity1 reporter published : 10:27 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 20 may 2013 an angry elephant took exception to having his picture taken - nonchalantly destroying thousands of pounds worth of camera equipment			1
the seven - tonne bull elephant casually threw the gear into a mud hole after discovering it near his watering hole			1
photographer @entity13 was trying to take close - ups of a herd of males in @entity17 , @entity18 , when the giant mammal struck			2
whoa @entity20 ! the camera goers flying after the elephant takes offence to its presence hope they were waterproof : mr @entity13 went through a number of cameras getting the shots but the costly lesson did not deter the @entity30 as he went through several expensive cameras , ranging between £ 395 to £ 3,945			1
he said : ' elephants are intelligent and curious creatures so i was n't surprised that he inspected the camera with his trunk , sniffing at it delicately			2
' but the utter contempt and disdain when he picked it up and gave it a toss , that hurt my feelings a little			0
' he added : ' if i had to guess , he was merely annoyed that there was this silly , clicky thing in the way of where he wanted to drink			0
' camera - shy : a camera gets a soaking from the bemused beast success : despite the numerous setbacks the tenacious photographer got the up close and personal pictures he wanted mr @entity13 also placed cameras in @entity56 and along the @entity57 in @entity58			1
he planted them at the edge of watering holes , using his past experience to guess where the elephants would wander			0
the 52 - year - old then operated the camera by remote from a truck 30 - 50m away			0
mudslinging : fortunately the photographer was able to get his abused cameras repaired after finishing his trip intimate : mr @entity13 was trying to take close - ups of a herd of males in @entity18 mud bath : this picture , taken by remote , shows the elephants throwing mud over themselves to cool off ' there might be someone crazy enough to lie down in a mud pool and try to photograph elephants from five feet away - but i 'm not that guy any more , ' added mr @entity13 , who comes from @entity85			1
' so i put the cameras out there and let them take the risks			2
it 's all off - the - shelf gear that anyone could buy			0
you just have to be willing to watch it get destroyed			0
' it 's sort of a @entity97 thing i 've unintentionally cultivated of late , avoiding attachments to material things			0
' fortunately mr @entity13 was able to get all of his damaged cameras repaired following the trip - but added : ' next time i try this , i will plan a little better and protect my cameras in waterproof cases			1
