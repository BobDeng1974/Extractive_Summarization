i did n't even know he had heard of @entity5 before , ' @entity1 's legal guardian @entity21 told the @entity23 on wednesday			1
a devoted fan of @entity5 ' since he was back at @entity25 [ @entity26 ] , ' according to mr @entity21 , @entity1 followed the athlete from 2008 until his final day on thursday			1
diagnosed with stage four leukaemia in february the boy underwent a bone marrow transplant in june but it did n't take			0
when his left lung developed an infection , consequently spreading to his right , doctors thought it would be best not to try again			0
' the doctors did a @entity38 scan to see how his lung was doing , but it was getting worse because the infection was spreading more , ' mr @entity21 said			0
' the doctors finally decided they did n't want to put him through another round of chemo because it would pretty much suppress his immune system and they did n't feel like he would be able to handle it			0

' once i heard he had a dying wish , i knew i had to do something more than send him presents and @entity66 with him on the computer , ' @entity5 told the @entity23 after announcing his plans			2
' i 'm usually uncomfortable going to hospitals when the @entity10 do events because it 's pretty tough to see kids in that situation			2
once i heard about ( @entity1 ) , i realized i had to get over it and do it for him , ' he said			2
with african - americans having only a 6 per cent chance of finding a match for a bone marrow transplant - compared to 85 - 88 per cent for @entity77 , according to the @entity78 said while he was visiting @entity1 he 'd provide a swab of his cheek as well			2
