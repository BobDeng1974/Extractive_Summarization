he predicted a nuclear arms race among rival @entity7 states that would carry the dangers without the safety mechanisms of the old rivalry between the @entity13 and the former @entity14			1
in an interview with @entity16 , he insisted @entity17 did not back military action against the @entity19 - as @entity20 is thought to be planning			0
he told the newspaper : " if [ the @entity4 ] obtain nuclear weapons capability , then i think other nations across the @entity7 will want to develop nuclear weapons			1
@entity26 warning : foreign secretary @entity2 said @entity4 's nuclear ambitions could trigger a ' new @entity6 ' that poses an even greater threat of nuclear conflict than the stand - off between the @entity14 and the @entity13 ' and so the most serious round of nuclear proliferation since nuclear weapons were invented would have begun , with all the destabilising effects in the @entity7 - and the threat of a new @entity6 in the @entity7 without necessarily all the safety mechansims			1
' that would be a disaster in world affairs			0
' he said that @entity17 could be in range of @entity4 nuclear weapons and that nuclear materials could fall into the hands of terrorists			1
however he said all options must remain on the table when dealing with president @entity48 's regime			0
hidden powers ? the nuclear power plant in @entity51 , southern @entity4 , is a major producer of electricity but the @entity54 fear possible military dimensions to @entity4 's nuclear power programme			2
there is growing speculation among @entity60 officials that @entity20 may be planning to launch military attacks against @entity4 missile facilities this summer , ahead of the @entity64 presidential elections this autumn			1
several @entity20 diplomats have been unsuccessfully targeted by @entity4 hit squads around the world in the last few days			0
the @entity64 has told @entity20 it does not want @entity20 to attack @entity4			2
however , earlier this month @entity64 defence secretary @entity68 told the @entity69 that he thought the window for an attack on @entity4 by @entity20 is between april and june			2
like the bad old days but worse : mr @entity2 warned of a nuclear @entity6 and a new arms race in the @entity7 that would pose an even greater risk than the historic stand - off between the @entity13 and the @entity14 , whose troops are pictured here president @entity77 has stressed that he wants to allow time for new sanctions to damage @entity4 's ailing economy before turning to a military approach			1
but other @entity64 officials believe sanctions will not work			2
an official knowledgeable in @entity7 policy told @entity86 : ' the guys in @entity88 are behaving like sanctions do n't matter , like they 're economy is n't collapsing , like @entity20 is n't going to do anything			1
sanctions are all we 've got to throw at the problem			0
if they fail then it 's hard to see how we do n't move to the ' in extremis ' position			0
' in his comments to @entity16 mr @entity2 said that the @entity17 government is ' not favouring the idea of anybody attacking @entity4 at the moment			0
' he added that they support a ' twin - track ' strategy of sanctions and pressure , and negotiations on the other hand			0
