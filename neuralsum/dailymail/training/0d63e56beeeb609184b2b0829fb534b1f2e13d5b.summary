by @entity0 @entity1 will undergo surgery on his injured knee at the end of the current @entity6 series against @entity7 in a bid to be fit for next year ’s @entity9			1
the 28 - year - old @entity11 fast bowler has been suffering from patella tendonitis in his right knee for several months but has bowled through the pain barrier this summer after first experiencing significant problems during the @entity17 tour last winter			2
the 6 ’ 5 ” quick has worn a special supportive brace on his knee – originally designed for race horses - this summer which has enabled him to play in all of @entity11 ’s five @entity21 so far and should see him play through to the end of the current five - match series			2
on his knees : @entity1 is set for surgery after the test series against @entity7 but will play the remaining tests he has discussed the possibility of surgery in the past , but sources close to him yesterday confirmed it is ‘ highly probable ’ he will have his knee operated on shortly after the completion of the final test at the @entity34 which finishes august 19			1
the recovery time for the surgery , which will see tendons in his knee cut and shortened , should be in the region of three to four months , meaning @entity1 will miss @entity11 ’s the upcoming five - match odi series against @entity7 as well as the seven - match tour to @entity42 in november – but crucially he should be fit for the @entity9 in @entity43 next february			1
‘ it makes logical sense to have the surgery at the end of this test series as the focus is then very much on the @entity9 , ’ a source said			0
under strain : @entity1 has been struggling with his injury throughout this five - test series main men : @entity1 ( second left ) and @entity55 ( left ) are @entity11 's attack leaders @entity1 has battled manfully through the summer , despite experiencing excruciating pain every time he delivers the ball			1
the pain got so bad during the second test at @entity60 that he was forced to take hot baths in the middle of the night in order to ‘ get some heat ’ through the joint and enable him to get some sleep			0
‘ at lord ’s i was having hot baths in the middle of the night just to get some warmth through it but i can honestly say that i ’m more confident about getting through all five tests than i have been at any point this summer , ’ @entity1 told @entity67 on sunday			0
last week ’s third test at @entity74 , which saw @entity1 take three vital wickets , was considered ‘ make or break ’ for @entity1 but he was able to bowl relatively pain free and therefore avoided having surgery midway through the summer .			0

@entity1 has been struggling with a knee injury throughout @entity6 series
he is *expected* to play in fourth test at @entity83 , starting on *thursday*
@entity11 @entity86 *captain* faces biggest *workload* of any player
