the wreck lay a few metres from the beach			2
hidden away in a small rocky cove , the @entity4 merchantman sat , broken - backed , on the seabed where @entity8 bombs had deposited it more than 70 years before			2
i ’d been apprehensive , not liking the idea of scuba - diving with skeletons			1
' no , no ' , @entity14 , my deeply - tanned curly - haired guide had insisted			0
' there ’s nothing more down there than nuts and bolts and the odd bit of rotted cargo			0
' as i was about to discover , there was far more down there than that			0
spectacular : the bright blue waters of the @entity28 coastline hide a spectacular underwater world i had arrived a few days earlier , touching down at @entity28 's @entity31 airport after a particularly grim 5am red - eye from @entity33			0
i ’d stumbled out of the typically tiny airport to be confronted by a flat concrete car park blotted with bollards and a whiff of hot tar and thyme			1
back in @entity4 for the first time in years , i was headed for a place called @entity42 , a tiny clump of hotels perched on a round bay that had , over the years , been fought over by the @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and latterly , the @entity8			2
but while this might have been the stomping ground of @entity53 , @entity54 , latterly of @entity55 , and @entity56 , there was very little that was @entity58 about it			1
i was staying at the @entity60 , one two hotels at @entity42 , a pretty spot that sprawls across 346 acres of scrub and thyme dotted land that , along with a seashell - shaped beach , also includes a golf course and an on - site olive grove			0
it ’s not cheap but neither are the rooms : mine boasted a large private pool , trails of shocking pink bougainvillea and a bedroom the size of the average @entity79 flat			0
wonderful : @entity80 explored one of the 89 wrecks littering the seabed in the @entity84 luxe : the @entity60 at @entity42 proved the perfect base for an undersea adventure private : each suite has a private pool and stunning sea views tempting though spending most of my time ensconced beside the pool was – and believe me , that ’s what most do – i had a date with a diving instructor to attend			1
@entity4 , although much - loved as a sun - dappled family holiday destination , is n’t known for its diving			2
in reality , there ’s plenty to see beneath the @entity4 waves , whether shoals of tropical fish or the wrecked seabed remains of the many cultures and peoples who have passed through			1
@entity110 , a scallop - shaped stretch of gleaming cobalt water freckled with azure patches of coral is no exception			1
the bay has been the site of several naval battles , the first in @entity120 when an @entity122 fleet destroyed a defending @entity58 fleet in a bloody encounter			1
more recently , a combined fleet of @entity49 , @entity127 and @entity128 ships joined forces to defeat a @entity48 - @entity131 war group in the bay during the @entity133			0
later , during the @entity134 , @entity110 was the site of @entity8 attacks on @entity4 shipping – among them the ship i was about to see , 30ft below the waves of the bay			1
one of 89 wrecks that litter the sea bed , the @entity4 merchantman was the victim of an @entity8 bombing strike , albeit a spectacularly cack - handed one			1
having managed to miss the ship on its first run and instead destroying a rocky outcrop , the rubble of which can still be seen , the bomber was forced to circle around – providing the @entity4 crew with ample time to jump ship			0
timeless : away from the beach , the landscape looks much the same as it did during @entity58 times wildlife : as well as wrecks and tropical fish , the clear waters are famous for sea turtles the second run hit the target , breaking the ship ’s back and consigning it to a watery grave			1
the fishermen who risked their lives to save the sailors returned to @entity110 ’s main harbour of @entity110 to a heroes ’ welcome			1
today , the men of @entity110 , a picturesque little village set around a honey - stone square dotted with cafes , are largely employed in the tourist trade – including as dive masters			1
one such was @entity14 , a genial six - footer with curly hair and a penchant for cigarettes who ferried us out into @entity110			1
the ship we were heading for was tucked away in a quiet cove , a scalloped spot surrounded by asperous rocks blotched with lichen set above a small stretch of bright white sand			0
it was from there that we headed into the sea – no backwards roll off the side of the boat here – and plunged into an underwater world of trailing seaweed and fish in every shade from delicate blush pink to bright nasturtium yellow			2
then the wreck itself hoved into view , dappled with sunshine from above and rusting gently in its watery grave			0
@entity215 encrustations thickened its rails and bows , while brightly coloured fish dipped in and out of its portholes			2
broken - backed , it sat in two pieces with debris scattered around the seabed around it			0
a mysterious collection of cans , burst open with their contents gone			0
all the essentials , in short , for life aboard ship			0
stunning : @entity110 is dotted with beaches , including the scallop - shaped @entity236 further out , the debris gave way to rocks and fish and as the land sloped away , to delicate shells and vast grassy stretches of seaweed			1
small clumps of coral littered the seabed , as did chunks of rock gouged by the sea from the sloping cliffs of the cove			0
a school of transparent , tiny fish			1
it was n’t the vivid world of the @entity259 or the @entity260 but it was beautiful : a shimmering symphony of azure , palest pink and lemon yellow			0
back on the boat , we took a detour on the way back to @entity110 to inspect a smattering of @entity58 graffiti etched onto the pink rock of another small cove – a reminder , if ever there was one , of the long history of this spot			1
ancient villages and an even older landscape surround @entity42 , a harsh , barren and ultimately beautiful place pocked with olive groves that still looks very much as it would have to the @entity46			2
diving in @entity4 might not have the glamour of the @entity259 but for beauty , history and some of the best food in the world , it ’s hard to beat			2
and getting there takes less than four hours - even if you do have to brave early morning @entity290			0
ca n’t say fairer than that			0
