she was offered routine blood tests but they were not classed as urgent			0
her concerned mother @entity43 , 56 , eventually insisted on accompanying her on a visit to the surgery on february 19			1
the doctor who examined her said her symptoms required urgent treatment and she was immediately rushed to hospital where she was given a scan			0
doctors discovered a tumour that had wrapped itself around her bowel			2
the cancer had also spread to her liver			1
@entity8 was transferred to @entity56 's @entity55 and despite chemotherapy , her condition worsened and she passed away on april 30			1
' full of life ' : her mother @entity43 said that @entity8 ( pictured age six , left , and age four in dance clothes ) was a ' unique , bubbly and beautiful person ' who as a teenager loved going out with friends and listening to music mrs @entity8 has opened up about how she held @entity8 's hand in her final moments just 10 weeks after she had been diagnosed with cancer			1
she said : ' @entity8 was a unique , bubbly and beautiful person			2
being a typical teenager she loved music and going on with her friends			0
' she was just so full of life and things were just starting for her , but in january this year she started complaining about feeling ill. ' she would n't be able to go out [ with friends ] because of a sore pain in her side			1
' as time wore on she went to the doctors again and again			2
she had been to the doctors about four or five times , but each time she was prescribed something different			1
@entity8 ( pictured , right , in 2012 with her mother @entity43 , left , and her sister @entity83 , centre ) had initially been diagnosed with @entity14 but doctors eventually realised she was suffering from bowel cancer ' she would never finish the course of the drugs and i was always on at her to take them			1
but she would say they were making her feel worse , not better			0

' her father @entity110 said : ' we were just speechless			0
this was our young , healthy teenage daughter who was so healthy and had everything to live for			0
the worse part of knowing the truth was knowing that @entity8 had to be told too			2
' she was 19 , an adult and she had a right , but we just wanted to save her			0
@entity8 ( pictured left as a one - year - old with her sister @entity83 , then 14 , and brother @entity110 , then six ) fought against the cancer but died on april 30 bowel cancer affects 40,000 @entity123 and kills 16,000 each year			1
symptoms usually include abdominal pain , blood in the stool , unexplained constipation or diarrhoea and unexplained weight loss			1
it is the third most common cancer in the @entity123 , but is the second most common in women			0
around 72 per cent of cases occur in those aged over 65 but numbers of young people developing the disease are rising rapidly			2
the number of young people with bowel cancer has more than doubled in ten years			1
obesity and lack of exercise are blamed for the 120 per cent rise in cases among under - 30s between 1997 and 2006			1
age , a low - fibre diet , being overweight , high alcohol intake , smoking and a family history of the disease increases your risk of developing disease			2
the disease is usually treated with a combination of surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
early detection and treatment usually results in a cure but late diagnosis only has a five year survival rate of 6 per cent			0
' we did n't want her to be frightened			0
a doctor explained that without treatment she would n't survive			0
that day , our whole world just fell apart			0
' @entity8 remained in the @entity170 where she was treated and visited by her parents and her older sister @entity172 , 33 , and brother @entity110 , 25			1
but after just 10 weeks she lost her battle against the disease			0
mrs @entity8 said : ' when @entity8 was admitted , we were just in such shock , even @entity8 was convinced she was going to get better			2
' she even updated her @entity178 status telling her friends that she did have cancer , but she would get better			0
' but every day i watched my beautiful daughter grow weaker and weaker , i just felt so helpless , so useless			0
' she was in a single room because she was so sick and from then on , i just slept in a chair beside her			0
@entity110 was given a fold - down bed and stayed with her every moment for her final month			0
' in the last three days of her life she could n’t speak but i knew she could hear us			0
' on april 30 , @entity43 woke up and noticed @entity8 's breathing had become laboured			1
@entity110 called for the nurse and they advised the parents to call in siblings @entity83 and @entity110			2
' later that day she slipped away			0
we were numb , shell - shocked , devastated , ' added mrs @entity8			1
' it had all happened so fast and it we were living our worst nightmare			0
' we watched our little fighter go through hell but she fought all she could to the very last second			0
' while @entity8 's parents do not blame the health centre for her death , they are seeking answers			2
mrs watt said : ' we do n't want anyone else to be faced with this			0
it was the last thing anybody would ever have expected to have to such a young person			0
' over 600 people attended @entity8 's funeral and gathered at @entity213 on may 3			2
@entity43 added : ' the past few months have just been overwhelming			1
somehow @entity8 knew she had cancer , but she tried to be strong for everyone else			1
' it all happened so fast , we do n’t know if anything else could have been done			0
but we do feel we need some answers , so that we can gain some closure and properly start grieving			0
@entity8 's mother ( centre ) as well as @entity8 's friends and family recently ran the @entity225 to raise money for research into cancer ' our family have had to go through this and we do n’t want anyone else to be faced with this			1
it was the last thing anybody would ever have expected to have to such a young person			0
' now we want to urge parents to really listen to their children			0
even @entity110 and i feel we overlooked @entity8 ’s symptoms but we are not medical people			2
' we should have pushed more , went back to the doctors and insisted			0
' doctors at the hospital told the family that they had never seen a case like @entity8 ’s because she was so young			1
bowel cancer is typically seen in older men but numbers of the deadly disease have risen by 120 per cent in the past ten years			1
@entity8 repeatedly visited @entity32 to get help for her upsetting symptoms but doctors overlooked the possibility of cancer because the media studies student was so young more than 60 of @entity8 's friends and family ran the @entity257 in her honour last month to raise money for @entity260			1
@entity43 said : ' we have already collected £ 4500 for @entity260 with more money still to come in			2
' it was a good day and is for a very worthwhile cause			0
@entity8 would have liked it as all her friends did it			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity32 said : ' this is a very tragic case and our thoughts are with @entity8 's family at this difficult time			1
' we would encourage them to get in touch with us if they want to discuss their concerns further			0

@entity8 , 19 , complained of abdominal pain , a swollen stomach , fatigue , intense thirst and appetite loss in january this year
she visited her surgery five times but each time saw a different gp
doctors presumed she suffered with *irritable* bowel *syndrome* because both her mother @entity43 , 56 , and her sister @entity83 , 33 , had condition
but in february she was diagnosed with bowel cancer that had spread to her liver and despite *undergoing* chemotherapy , she died in april
once thought of as a disease that only affected the elderly , cases of bowel cancer in under - 30s have shot up by 120 *%* in the past ten years
