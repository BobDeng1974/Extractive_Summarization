by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:11 est , 22 september 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 22 september 2013 @entity2 today tried to distance himself from @entity4 ’s vile culture of spin and smears			1
he insisted he had never been engaged in the sort of ‘ reprehensible ’ briefings against colleagues exposed in the memoirs of disgraced @entity12 spin doctor @entity11			1
and he insisted it was not in his nature to take part in such behaviour , claiming : ‘ i am not sure i have ever been accused of being macho			1
’ pressure : with the @entity4 conference dominated by revelations from the @entity22 memoirs , leader @entity2 tried to distance himself from the parties past critics will claim that this latest allegation underlines the public interest in the amoral political world in which mr @entity12 ’s spin doctor operated the @entity30 conference in @entity32 risks being dominated by the @entity22 memoirs , which have lifted the lid on the relentless in - fighting , briefings and smears which dominated the last government			1
the scandal risks reminding voters of mr @entity2 ’s role as a close lieutenant of mr @entity12 , alongside shadow chancellor @entity42			1
this weekend mr @entity42 admitted he was part of a blokeish culture which damaged @entity4			1
he told @entity45 : ' the period up to 1997 and after , yes , it was macho			2
i look back on that as a time we were young and inexperienced			2
' it was something both [ @entity53 and @entity12 ] allowed to happen			1
it was a mistake and it was damaging to the government			2
' but mr @entity2 today insisted he had urged mr @entity12 to sack mr @entity11 amid suspicions about his behaviour , which he said were ‘ not my kind of politics ’			1
image conscious : mr @entity2 was seen walking in @entity32 with his adviser @entity61 , daughter of former @entity4 leader @entity62 the police could be called in to investigate whether @entity11 broke the law when leaking government secretes , former @entity64 spin chief @entity63 has suggested			1
he accused mr @entity11 , @entity12 ’s former spin doctor , of having ‘ admitted not just to venality but criminality ’			1
mr @entity63 added : ‘ i think the other thing that people should be aware of is he [ @entity22 ] has admitted to criminal offences in this			1
’ in his memoir , mr @entity11 confesses to logging into mr @entity12 ’s official email account in the @entity76			1
he also admits leaking details of restricted and confidential documents			2
labour frontbenchers said that mr @entity2 read the riot act to the first meeting of his shadow cabinet , insisting anyone caught briefing against colleagues would be fired			2
mr @entity2 insisted that he now led a ‘ unified ’ party			2
during an appearance on @entity89 's @entity88 , mr @entity2 was asked whether he could ‘ look into your heart during that period and say to yourself that you were completely clean ’			2
he replied : ‘ i think that people who know me would say that i am someone who has never engaged in the factionalism and was never engaged in the briefing			0
‘ that was n't my style of politics			0
it has never been my style of politics and i find it reprehensible and not something i would engage in			2
‘ i am someone who is deeply committed to the @entity30 and deeply committed to @entity105 and that is the way i have always approached my politics			0
’ however mr @entity11 's account of vicious @entity4 in - fighting , serialised in the @entity109 , has cast a shadow over the party 's conference			1
in particular serious questions have been raised about mr @entity12 ’s failure to act to stop the behaviour			1
ex-cabinet minister @entity116 said mr @entity12 must publicly state that he did not know about the activities of mr @entity11 or have his own reputation tarnished			1
she says she is ‘ sure ’ mr @entity2 was aware of his activities			0
@entity116 , who claimed to be a victim of smears from mr @entity12 's faction , told the @entity123 : ‘ @entity12 is not an innocent , it is inconceivable he did not know what @entity11 was doing			1
@entity11 clearly felt it was implicitly sanctioned			0
’ mr @entity12 should be ‘ ashamed ’ of employing mr @entity11			1
he must disown him – or suffer the consequences			0
‘ in the absence of a very clear statement by @entity12 that he did n’t know about it , it damages his reputation			1
only @entity12 can deal with that			2
’ ‘ if he refused , it would destroy the credit given to him for rescuing the country during the banking collapse			0
’ revelations : shadow home secretary @entity138 ( left ) warned @entity4 not to go back to the navel gazing of the past while @entity116 said it was ' inconceivable ' @entity12 did n't know about the smears revealed in @entity11 's memoirs energy firms will be banned from increasing prices while making huge profits under a plan to be unveiled by @entity4 this week			1
@entity2 will take on gas and electric firms to stop them ripping off customers			0
companies will also be forced to pass on savings when wholesale prices fall			0
up to 4million pensioners will be automatically put on the cheapest tariff in a move which could save them up to £ 200 a year each			0
@entity157 energy secretary @entity156 said : ' people are sick and tired of paying over the odds			0
' senior @entity4 figures lined up to distance themselves - and their leader - from the @entity22 revelations			1
shadow home secretary @entity138 , whose husband @entity42 was a key @entity165 , said mr @entity11 was ' out of control '			0
she told @entity169 ' @entity168 programme : ' i think this is ... about a kind of politics that really is appalling , that we should never go back to			0
' it is something that happened some years ago , but i think it 's a sign of how much the @entity30 has changed , the very different climate , the very different way in which @entity2 is managing things and operating things now , that 's a good thing , we do n't want to go back to the navel gazing of the past			0
' @entity157 business secretary @entity187 said of the ex-spin doctor : ' he 's a relic from the past			2
there is no place for that kind of nasty , vile politics in @entity105 today			0
i am glad we 've seen the back of him			0
' he said he was at a shadow cabinet meeting where mr @entity2 was ' very clear he will not tolerate any of that kind of behaviour '			2
' if anyone is found to be briefing against anybody you will be out , there 's no discussion			0
that 's not the way @entity2 does things , " he told a fringe meeting organised by the @entity210 magazine			0
' if any good comes from @entity11 's indulgence , it 's to remind people that that 's not the way we do things			0
' everybody who was around then , and is still around , knows how damaging that was			0
think how much more we could have achieved if so much energy had not been expended on this nonsense			0
