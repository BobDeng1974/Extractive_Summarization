mr @entity8 , from @entity32 , said : ' i was on a night out and i decided to buy a @entity16 to use for snacks over the next couple of days			0
' next evening i was eating a couple of pieces , and i pulled the skin off one and that was when i saw it			2
it looked just like a brain , all white and wrinkled			1
' i was really shocked at the time , it is one of these things you hear about people finding but you never expect to see it on your plate			0

@entity57 : the horrified student sent the chicken back to the fast food chain who said that it was a kidney after tests he added : ' @entity7 have offered me some sort of goodwill gift but i do n't think that is really acceptable , since i do n't want to eat there again			1

we sell 200 million pieces of chicken every year and always try to ensure the highest standards in every restaurant			2
