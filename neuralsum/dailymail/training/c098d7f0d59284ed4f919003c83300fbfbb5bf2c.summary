by @entity0 it 's a competition run by radio stations the world over ... calling in to win a cash prize - but you have to be a particular numbered caller in the line before you can play			1
three workers at a @entity10 phone company thought they could beat the system as they developed a system to ensure they were guaranteed to be the 25th caller to @entity16 's ' beat the @entity15 ' contest			1
the competition airs on the @entity18 radio station five times each weekday during which time successful callers push their luck with a chance of winning up to $ 50,000			1
contest : the competition allows specific callers to try and win money their time runs out ongoing : the competition runs several times throughout the morning as callers try their luck now , an internal investigation is underway at @entity31 to determine if they jumped ahead in @entity16 ’s call queue for its @entity34			2
once the @entity35 announces that the contest is in progress @entity16 picks the 25th caller to compete live on - air			1
@entity31 are not saying exactly what kind of technology was used to ensure they callers landed in the right place , but as the company also control the phone lines that the radio station uses , it would n't take a genius to come up with some sort of method			1
@entity31 are also the sister company of @entity51 who own the @entity16 radio station			2
suspicions : three workers at @entity56 have been suspended whist the radio station and phone company discover if there was any foul play theory : the suggestion is that somehow the workers at the phone company were able to secure their places in line on the radio station switchboard in order to qualify @entity31 have released a statement regarding the issue : ' it was brought to our attention by concerned employees that three employees were jumping ahead in the call queue for the @entity76 on @entity16			1
we moved very quickly to alert @entity16 and to put a fix in place to avoid this happening for their contests in the future			0
' the company said it is taking the issue very seriously and an internal investigation is underway			0
three employees – a man and two women – have been suspended with pay and sent home			0
the statement continued : ' we take a lot of pride in the integrity of our people and our network and we are thankful that our employees were concerned enough to bring this to our attention			0
' ' once brought to our attention , our contest call - in system was reviewed immediately			0
we remain confident in the security of the system and can ensure our listeners ' beat the bank ' and similar contests are completely fair for all , ' said the radio station			2
' we hold the integrity of our contests to the highest degree			0
as a result , we are withholding the final winnings of these individuals pending the outcome of the investigation by @entity31			0
' one of the employees is believed to have won $ 750 towards the end of august			0
conflict of interest : both the radio station , @entity16 and the phone company , @entity31 are owned by the same telecommunications group			1

contest allows listeners to try and win cash - but they have to be the 25th caller
three workers at a @entity10 phone company were able to work the switchboard so they would *automatically* be the winning callers
they *'ve* now been suspended whilst radio station and phone company work out if there was foul play
radio station and phone company owned by the same media group
