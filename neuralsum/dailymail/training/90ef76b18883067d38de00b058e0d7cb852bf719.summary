by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity2 have deleted everything the party said before the last election from its website to stop people checking if they have broken promises			1
a decade of speeches , articles and press releases has been wiped from the archive , with the material also disappearing from search engine results			1
the attempt to rewrite digital history appears to be at odds with @entity20 ’s pro-transparency declaration that political leaders had to ‘ let go of the information that we 've guarded so jealously ’			1
wiped : visitors to the @entity2 website will not be able to find any material which predates the 2010 election speeches and press statements dating from the year 2000 to may 2010 have also been removed from the @entity29 which acts as a public record of the internet			1
the speech and news archive disappeared at some time after october 5 this year , @entity33 magazine reported			0
a robot blocker was posted on the site which means search engines and the @entity29 can not keep a record of what used to be held there			1
as a result the @entity29 has removed the entire record of speeches and news captured since 8 may 1999			0
it includes promises on cutting inheritance , not imposing ' pointless reorganisations ' of the @entity49 and and he pro-environment message ' vote blue , go green '			0
for example , users searching for a story on the launch of the 2010 election manifesto after greeted with a message saying : ' the page you are looking for has been removed , had its name changed , or is temporarily unavailable			0
' web robots have been used to block search engines from finding archive material including speeches and news articles dating back to 1999 the revelation is embarrassing because both mr @entity20 and chancellor @entity67 have highlighted the importance of being open with data online			1
in 2006 mr @entity20 told @entity72 ’s @entity71 conference : ‘ you 've begun the process of democratising the world 's information			2
‘ @entity77 is the right word to use because by making more information available to more people , you 're giving them more power			0
’ it is unclear who is responsible for taking the decision to remove the archive at @entity86			0
@entity88 mp @entity87 said : ' the @entity89 are trying to hide from their own broken promises and failed policy			1
rather than owning up to the mess they ’re making of the economy and fixing it , they are pretending it has n't happened			0
' this cynical stunt wo n't fool any family suffering from a cost of living crisis			0
with hardworking people over £ 1,600 a year worse off under him , it will take more than @entity20 pressing " delete " to make people forget about his broken promises and failure to stand up for anyone beyond a privileged few			1
' openness : @entity2 leader @entity20 used to boast to @entity72 that access to information gave voters more ' power ' the loss of the archive comes as the @entity2 party gears up for the 2015 general election			2
@entity116 trategist @entity115 has been hired full - time in a £ 500,000 deal to deliver the overall majority to mr @entity20 which eluded him in 2010			2
a @entity2 spokesman said : ' we ’re making sure our website keeps the @entity2 at the forefront of political campaigning			0
' these changes allow people to quickly and easily access the most important information we provide – how we are clearing up @entity88 ’s economic mess , taking the difficult decisions and standing up for hardworking people			2

speeches , articles and press releases disappear from @entity135
web robots used to stop search engines keeping records of *pledges*
@entity88 *accuses* @entity20 of trying to ' delete ' broken promises
