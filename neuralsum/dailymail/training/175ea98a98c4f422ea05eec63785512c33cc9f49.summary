more than 600 students at the @entity1 have been put at risk of infection with @entity4 and hepatitis six hundred students have been put at risk of @entity4 and hepatitis because a healthcare worker failed to followed correct clinical procedures			1
past and present students at the @entity1 - who had either vaccinations or blood tests - have been advised to attend screenings for the infections to ensure they have not been infected			2
the advice was given after an investigation was opened into the safety of procedures carried out by a member of staff who was formerly contracted to provide services within the @entity23 at the university			0
experts at @entity26 have said the actions of a healthcare worker put students at risk of @entity4 and hepatitis b and @entity32 the worker involved failed to change the syringe barrels which needles are attached to between each patient			1
this oversight occurred over a period of eight years putting 606 students at risk			1
the affected patients are those that were seen by the healthcare worker between september 2005 and october 2013			1
dr @entity44 , medical director , @entity46 and @entity47 said : ‘ this investigation has taken place as it is understood that , whilst syringe needles were always changed between patients , the syringe barrels to which the needles attach were being reused in the administration of vaccinations			1
‘ this also occurred during blood taking , where a single use holder for a blood collection tube was reused but needles changed			2
‘ therefore , there is an extremely low possibility these errors may have put people at risk of infection from hepatitis b , hepatitis c or @entity4			2
‘ with this in mind , as a precaution , we have reviewed all available university health records and the 606 people identified have all been contacted and invited to attend a blood test at their local hospital or via their gp			2
’ he added : ‘ we are extremely sorry for the undoubted worry and concern people we are contacting may feel on receiving this news			0
‘ i would however like to stress that the risk is extremely low and would encourage all those we contact , who may not already have been screened after their time at the university , to present themselves for blood testing			2
the patients were put at risk by a healthcare worker who failed to change syringe barrels between patients			1
