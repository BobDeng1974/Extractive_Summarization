@entity1 striker @entity0 is confident he will return stronger from his three - month injury lay - off and can forge a dynamic strike partnership with @entity4 forward @entity5			1
@entity0 , 28 , has recovered more quickly than expected since suffering a freak broken leg when challenging for the ball in the closing stages of the 2 - 2 draw against @entity11 on august 23			1
manager @entity12 revealed the @entity13 international could even be in contention for saturday 's @entity17 showdown against @entity18 , although next weekend 's trip to @entity20 is perhaps a more realistic target given the player 's lengthy absence			0
@entity0 , though , believes rather than be in direct competition , the pair have the technical ability to develop a clinical partnership			1
' after an injury of three months , you need to have a good rhythm back - you think you are fit , but the competition is everything			2
i will need a couple of games to be 100 per cent , but mentally and physically i am close , ' @entity0 said			1
' it was the first time for me i have been out for three months , but it was good for my mentality , because i feel i will be back stronger , with more determination - and the doctor told me even my bone will be stronger			2
' @entity0 , who plundered 22 goals last season , added : ' i think we needed ( to buy ) another striker , especially when my injury came			1
' @entity5 has done really well up to now , but i am not worried that we have bought @entity5			2
' i think we will have a good understanding on the pitch and can play together , that is the main thing , we are quite complementary			0
' it is a plus for us , and it will be good for the competition within the group , we will give our best every week			0
@entity5 celebrates scoring against @entity1 ( right ) in 2012 before making the move to @entity67 this summer @entity5 challenges @entity68 for the ball in @entity1 's training session ' we have our best years in front of us as a team , with the quality we have in the squad , now we have the quantity also , that is why i can not wait to come back			1
' @entity0 has been a frustrated spectator from the sidelines , unable to help his team - mates as @entity1 struggled to deliver regular results , despite the impressive form of summer signing @entity81			1
the @entity13 forward , who is helping promote the new @entity85 campaign from @entity86 , believes @entity1 must learn to rediscover their composure once the hard work of getting control of a game has been done			1
' we need consistency , but we also need to know how to close out the game after winning it , like against @entity94 and @entity95 away , ' said @entity0			2
' i could not believe what i was watching ( against @entity94 ) , that is one of our weaknesses , we do n't know how to close the game when we are winning			0
' we must just stay at the back and not take too much risk , i do n't know where it comes from , but we need to improve ourselves in this way			0
' tactically , we all defend together , we are all attacking together , so it is all about the balance of our team , you can not just target the defenders			0
' maybe we need more support for the defence when you are winning the game , just stay and do n't go ( forward ) any more			0
' @entity1 sit sixth ahead of saturday 's showdown with @entity18 , but @entity0 has not given up yet on mounting a title challenge through 2015			1
' it is only november , there are still a lot of games left to play , the main thing is to take maximum points against the big teams , ' he said			0
' @entity123 have got a good advantage , but you never know			0
' @entity0 features in the new @entity85 campaign from @entity86 , the smallest ever advertising in football			2
it demonstrates the extreme detail of @entity85 television technology by showing that every minute detail on the pitch can be seen .			0
