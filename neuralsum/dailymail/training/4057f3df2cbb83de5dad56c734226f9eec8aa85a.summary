it 's the dilemma faced by jetsetting shoppers the world over – buying too many goodies to fit in your suitcase on the way home			2
do you shell out for yet another ‘ emergency ’ suitcase , to add to the piles of unwanted luggage cluttering up your home ? or spend a small fortune shipping your things back ? now an inventor claims to have come up with a better solution , and it ’s one that really could take off – an inflatable suitcase			2
the @entity22 suitcase pictured can triple in size using an electric pump that plugs straight into the mains when it is expanded , the wheeled suitcase can store 120 litres worth of clothes and will cost £ 190 it was inspired , he says , by @entity31 ’s magical bag which famously had room for everything including a lampshade			1
the new case has side walls similar to an accordion , allowing it to expand in height by an extra 17 inches ( 45cm ) , tripling its volume from 40 litres to 120 litres			1
the walls of the suitcase can be inflated in around 20 seconds using an electronic pump , plugged into a mains supply			1
best of all , it allows holidaymakers to save time and money by starting their journey using a compact carry - on size , which is compatible with airlines ’ hand luggage size restrictions , according to one of its makers @entity55			0
once inflated for the journey home , the case – named the @entity22 after a @entity59 pufferfish – can simply be checked it in as hold baggage			1
it is expected to cost about £ 190 when it goes on sale			1
@entity65 , industrial designer at @entity22 , got the idea for the case when he had to buy new luggage on his way home from a trip because his carry - on bag could not fit in all his extra shopping			1
the inflated suitcase , which is now in the prototype stage , can also be used as a surface on which you could stand a laptop or make - up mirror , and has the option of internal shelves to transform it into a cupboard			2
its four multi-directional 360 degree wheels make it easy to manoeuvre around the airport , while the fabric of the sides is impact resistant pvc material found in inflatable boats			0
this means the case should withstand being tossed around the baggage hold			0
its makers aim to incorporate other features , such as a refrigerated compartment to protect perishable items and a light which comes on when you open the suitcase in the dark			0
the company is raising funding through @entity105 , an online crowd - funding website			0
mr @entity55 is hoping the suitcase will be available to order by december next year .			0

the @entity22 suitcase can expand from 40 litres to a staggering 120 litres
