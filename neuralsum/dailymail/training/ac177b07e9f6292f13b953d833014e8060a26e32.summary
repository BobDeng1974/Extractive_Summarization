apps like @entity48 from @entity49 include live field recordings , while @entity45 has geographically - oriented apps that teach users the bird songs of over 2,000 local birds			2
most of these apps are billed as educational , with little thought having been given to the negative effects they might have on mating and migratory birds			2

' i â€™m sure visitors would be devastated if they realised the possible disturbance they were causing to wildlife			0
we need to spread the word that use of these apps is not suitable for nature reserves and can be potentially harmful to sensitive species			1
' @entity106 , from the @entity107 , said : ' repeatedly playing a recording of birdsong or calls to encourage a bird to respond in order to see it or photograph it can divert a territorial bird from other important duties , such as feeding its young			0
' it is selfish and shows no respect to the bird			0
' people should never use playback to attract a species during its breeding season			0
