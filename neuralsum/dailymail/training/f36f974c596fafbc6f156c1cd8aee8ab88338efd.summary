by @entity0 published : 22:08 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 03:58 est , 5 september 2013 graphic warnings on the back of cigarette packets will not deter teenage smokers , researchers have warned			1
even though pictures tend to put young people off smoking more than the written warnings on packets , they are often put on the back of packs making them less visible and less effective , according to research published online in the journal @entity14			1
the results come from two surveys - one of more than 1,000 11 to 16 - year - olds in the @entity18 in 2008 and a further 1,000 questioned in 2011			1
graphic warnings on the back of cigarette packets will not deter teenage smokers , researchers have warned delay : ministers say they want to consider the impact of laws passed in @entity24 mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking most of the teenagers in both surveys ( 68 per cent to 75 per cent ) had never smoked while 17 per cent to 22 per cent had experimented with cigarettes , and around one in 10 were already regular smokers - defined as at least one cigarette a week			1
half of those questioned in both surveys said they had ' often ' or ' very often ' noticed the warnings on packs , and around one in five had read them very often or looked closely at them			2
the number of teens saying the warnings put them off smoking increased between the two surveys , but not among regular smokers			1
in this group , the proportion who said that the warnings stopped them from having a cigarette fell from 32 per cent to 23 per cent			0
the teenagers ' ability to recall images depicting diseased lungs , rotten teeth and neck cancer , remained below 10 per cent while three text warnings on the back of packs with no supporting images were recalled by less than 1 per cent in either survey			2
the authors , from the @entity64 at the @entity65 , said : ' as warnings need to be salient to be effective , positioning pictorial warnings only on the less visible reverse panel limits their impact			1
' @entity70 : health minster @entity71 said she took up smoking because she liked the ' gorgeous ' @entity75 packets they said the fact the @entity18 has used the same pictures since 2008 may also have increased the ' wear out ' factor , particularly for regular smokers			1
' positioning pictorial warnings only on the back of packs may have had a deterrent effect on never and experimental smokers , but for most measures no significant differences were observed			1
' the impact on regular smokers was negligible			1
' @entity88 , @entity89 's head of tobacco policy , said : ' this research boosts the extensive evidence that picture health warnings are very effective in reminding smokers about the dangers of tobacco			2
' we know that well - placed picture warnings work and discourage young people from starting to smoke so we 're delighted that the @entity100 will vote on legislation for picture warnings to appear on both sides of cigarette packs			2
' @entity18 law requires picture warnings to appear only on the back of the pack			1
this research shows why @entity111 legislation is so important			0
' in the @entity18 207,000 young people start smoking every year and - of those who go on to be long term smokers - half will die of a smoking - related illness			1
' we must do all we can to protect the next generation from becoming tomorrow 's tobacco addicts			0
' @entity118 , chief executive of health charity @entity119 ( @entity119 ) , said : ' the evidence is clear : warnings on cigarette packs help deter young people from taking up smoking , and the larger and more graphic they are the better			2
' however , to be really effective , picture warnings need to be on the front of the packs			2
' currently the @entity128 does n't allow this but next week the @entity100 is due to vote on a directive which will require larger picture warnings on the front of all cigarette packs			0
the tobacco industry is lobbying hard against this			0
' @entity119 urges @entity136 not to let the tobacco industry succeed in its multimillion - pound campaign to delay the vote and derail the directive			0
' @entity141 , director of the smokers ' group @entity142 , said : ' everyone , including teenagers , knows there are health risks associated with smoking			0
' increasing the size of the warnings , or putting them on the front of the pack , will make no difference			0
' if you want to smoke you will smoke , regardless of the size or position of the warning			0
' if governments want to reduce youth smoking rates they should crack down on shopkeepers who sell cigarettes to children and tackle illicit trade			0
' they could also ban proxy purchasing and make it illegal to buy cigarettes if you are under 18			0
' instead , tobacco control campaigners are obsessed with headline - grabbing measures , like plain packaging , that merely highlight the failure of previous initiatives			0
