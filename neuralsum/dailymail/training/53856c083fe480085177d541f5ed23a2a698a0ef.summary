former @entity1 midfielder @entity0 believes his old club could be spiralling towards obscurity after more than two decades of @entity5 domination			1
@entity1 began the season with a 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity8 on saturday , continuing their disastrous form of the 2013 - 14 campaign under new manager @entity11			1
the @entity12 has since strengthened his defence with the signing of @entity16 's @entity15 but @entity0 fears his old club 's chances of breaking back into the top four are slim unless @entity20 adds another five ' proper ' players to his squad before the close of the transfer window			1
genuinely scared they could go into the wilderness in the same way @entity45 did in the 1990s			2
' what do they need ? five players			0
five proper players who can hit the ground running and turn round a situation that looks desperate			1
' let me be clear : i am sick of having to criticise the club which i gave my life to as a footballer			0
but @entity1 need to arrest their decline			2
' winner : @entity57 ( above ) celebrates scoring during @entity8 's 2 - 1 win against @entity1 after winning the title in sir @entity61 's final season in charge , @entity1 could only muster a seventh - place finish under the stewardship of @entity65 - and caretaker boss @entity36 - last season			0
hopes of a revival were high following the appointment of the experienced @entity20 earlier this summer , particularly after the 63 - year - old led @entity71 to the @entity73 semi-finals in impressive fashion			0
but with only three new players signed this summer and defensive trio @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 having moved on , @entity1 fans are unhappy about the summer 's dealings			2
@entity82 reach deal for @entity15 new boy : @entity1 have signed @entity84 defender @entity15 from @entity16 down : @entity85 ( right ) looks dejected as his team concede their second goal of the game			0

@entity0 is scared that his former club could go into decline if they do not get back on track this season
he believes @entity11 need five new ' proper ' players
the @entity97 star urged @entity1 to sign @entity98 and @entity99 before they moved to @entity100 and @entity101 respectively
the @entity103 could *struggle* like rivals @entity45 did before the turn of the *century*
