the @entity0 rolled into @entity1 on sunday night with a simple message for @entity3 : we ’re coming at you fully loaded			1
head coach @entity6 has promised to select his strongest side for the test at the @entity9 after a second - string @entity0 line - up scraped to victory over @entity12 on saturday			1
wales have not beaten the @entity14 since 1953 and @entity6 is plotting to extend the 25 - match winning run against a side low on confidence after their uninspiring 17 - 13 win over @entity20			1
‘ we ’ll look to pick the best team we can to counter what @entity3 will bring , ’ said @entity6			1
@entity0 head coach @entity6 says he will pick a side to beat @entity3 on saturday @entity0 stars @entity26 and @entity27 ( below ) are superstars in rugby mad @entity3 @entity27 struggled on his return to the starting line - up against @entity12 at the weekend ‘ we will try and pick the best players we ’ve got to do that			1
@entity3 are a good side			1
i ’m not sure why they ’re ranked where they are ; i think they should be ranked higher			0
‘ they finished fourth at the @entity37 and all they ’ve done since then is improve their team			0
they ’ve got big wingers and a big back three			0
their midfield is strong and there are n’t too many bigger than ( @entity45 ) @entity44			0
’ the southern hemisphere giants received a far more high - profile welcome in @entity1 than @entity3 ’ previous opponents , with television cameras and eager supporters waiting outside their city - centre hotel to catch a glimpse of @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity53			1
it was a stark contrast to @entity20 ’s reception in the @entity57 capital and an indication of the huge step up in performance required if @entity62 ’s side are going to emerge from this weekend ’s test with their credibility in tact			1
@entity6 noted the size and strength of a @entity57 midfield featuring @entity44 as reason to be worried @entity70 forms part of an imposing back three for the hosts who have n't beaten @entity74 since 1953 @entity3 conceded a staggering 22 turnovers against the @entity76 on saturday and such poor ball retention against @entity0 will be punished			1
this weekend ’s showdown has already been dubbed ‘ @entity79 ’ and @entity3 have to make exponential improvements if they are going to avoid an embarrassing defeat in @entity1			1
@entity82 says if @entity3 improve their accuracy they can force an unlikely victory over the visitors returning skipper @entity87 will need to be at his inspirational best but team - mate @entity82 believes an unlikely victory is not out of the question			1
‘ against @entity20 , they are always going to grab the ball and are capable of scoring some great tries , ’ said @entity82			2
‘ a lot of boys who played last week said this game felt harder			0
it was just accuracy and , against @entity0 , we know if they turn the ball over they will score			2
one thing we will work on this week is retaining the ball			0
if we do that , then we are capable of beating @entity0			2
’ poor performances from @entity62 ’s fringe players have made some calls easier than others ahead of monday ’s team announcement			0
but the most difficult decisions rest on the selection of @entity110 and @entity111 at full back and hooker			0
@entity53 made 224 metres — three times more than any of his team - mates — on saturday but now faces competition from @entity117 , who is hoping to be back in contention after suffering concussion against @entity120			2
in the pack , @entity62 must decide whether to wield the axe over hooker @entity111			0
the @entity123 forward is caught in the crossfire of a club - versus - country row , having shunned medical advice from the @entity3 team doctor to feature in friday night ’s defeat by @entity130			1
his boots were filled on saturday by @entity134 debutant @entity133 , whose afternoon started well with a dominant performance at the line - out , but fell apart as @entity20 launched a comeback in the second half			1
@entity110 was man of the match against @entity20 but his place is under threat by @entity117 's return despite having @entity144 sent off in the 53rd minute , the tourists almost snatched victory with a showing inspired by 20st 2lb centre @entity146			2
the @entity149 goliath will be hoping to continue his incredible scoring record — which now stands at 13 tries in 15 @entity152 — at next year ’s @entity37			0
@entity20 have become the forgotten team of the pool stages , but scrum - half @entity155 has warned the bigger nations to write - off the underdogs at their peril			2
‘ we are in the pool of death with @entity163 , @entity3 , @entity120 and @entity164 , ’ said @entity155			2
‘ it will be hard but it will be immense			0
we come over here and we play the next day			0
if we can have time , like a month , then we can make a difference in that pool			0
any team can beat any team , so it is open			0

@entity0 beat @entity12 24 - 16 and @entity3 beat @entity20 17 - 13 on saturday
