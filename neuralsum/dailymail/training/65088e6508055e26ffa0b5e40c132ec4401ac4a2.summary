the last time we met @entity7 had been underground , deep in the @entity6 tunnel system that @entity58 and his gang of homeless drug addicts call home			1
she was in the queue to buy drugs , perched on one of the heating pipes in front of an icon of the @entity68			0
the ring of infected syringe sores around her neck a jagged reminder of her drug - addicted life in the sewers			2
' this is where i destroyed myself ' , she had told us almost prophetically that day			0
she featured as one of the main characters in our film broadcast on @entity26 last month			1
a story that has shocked over two million people who have viewed it around the world and has ramped up the pressure on authorities charged with managing @entity31 ’s homeless youngsters			1
@entity7 , before her death , who featured in a @entity26 news report exposing the underground world beneath the streets of @entity6 fellow inhabitants of the sewers hold up a picture of the 18 - year - old , who was born into acute poverty and abandoned by her parents as a baby over two million people watched the original film on @entity31 's homeless youngsters and the authorities are facing pressure to do more for those in the underground world mourners taking part in @entity7 's funeral procession led a slow march to through @entity6 to @entity110 the mourners carried photographs of @entity7 , as well as a cross and religious imagery during her funeral procession but it is too late for @entity7			1
she collapsed and died in the tunnels last week after suffering from @entity4 , chronic pneumonia and heart failure which cut short her painfully short life			1
she had just turned 18			0
@entity26 was invited back to @entity31 and to her wake			2
we were ushered through the cobble stones and courtyard , past children playing in the dust and adults weeping by the door of the tiny tin roofed shack			0
@entity7 lay in the open casket veiled in a bridal gown , as is custom for @entity17 girls who die before their wedding day			1
a priest stood to one side , chanting prayers as her sisters stood over her , fussing over the veil , or rearranging her beloved pink cd player that they had stuffed under her pillow , music to keep her company in the grave			0
during the procession , mourners stopped at the at the sewer entrance , which led to the place she once called home the sewers are home to hundreds of homeless people , with many @entity154 positive and drug addicts the so - called ' king of the sewers ' @entity58 , right , attended @entity7 's funeral with his head painted in @entity159 , a bright silver paint that the addicts sniff authorities in @entity6 say @entity58 has been removed from the city several times by the police but keeps on returning faster than the police return to take him away as the candles flickered late into the night , @entity7 's friends began to arrive in the house , familiar faces from her home in the tunnels coming to pay their last respects			1
we found @entity175 , one of @entity7 's best friends whom we filmed joking around in the tunnels weeks earlier			2
' we met in a foster house named @entity179			0
i hanged out with her everywhere			0
she was like a sister to me , ' she told us tears streaming down her face			0
one of five siblings born into acute poverty , @entity7 's parents had abandoned her as a baby , sending her to live in a children 's institution on the edge of @entity6 , for the first years of her life			1
it was a factor we were told later by the head of the institution that had impacted deeply upon her life , a lifetime lacking in love that had drawn her deeply into life within the sewers			0
@entity58 and the tight knit gang underground she said had become the family @entity7 had never had			2
' for her getting some attention was an extraordinary experience , ' said @entity203 her sister , ' because now she felt valued in those moments			0
she was happy if anybody was looking out for her or giving her any attention , ' she said			0
the underground world of homeless people living in the sewers and tunnels beneath @entity6 was exposed by @entity26 last month everyone living in the sewers is @entity154 - positive and a quarter have @entity214 , yet they are left to rot in the darkness , huddling against heating pipes and sniffing glue to stay warm some even keep pets such as this dog in the tunnels , even though there is barely enough room for all the people living beneath the city the procession of mourners continued to stream in , silent faces , clutching her hand , kissing her forehead , whispering their goodbyes			1
the following morning , the day of @entity7 ’s funeral , it was the turn of @entity58 – the self - styled ' @entity234 '			2
never shy of a spectacle , he arrived barefoot with his head painted in @entity159 , a luminous helmet of bright silver paint that the addicts sniff			2
a stark reminder of the crazed drug - infested atmosphere where @entity7 had died			1
a window was removed from the house and the coffin was pulled out amidst wails and mournful chaos			0
carried in the back of an open transit van , a small gaggle of mourners led a slow march to the @entity252 , stopping at the sewer entrance , the hole she had once called home			0
for a hearse , a black transit van			0
then a procession through the city , where the pallbearers were drug addicts			1
many of the drug addicts sniff a metallic paint called @entity159 and the smell of the substance is overpowering in the tunnels one of the underground residents inspects a needle ready to inject containing a synthetic drug similar to methadone the same sewer entrance we had disappeared into weeks earlier appears empty			1
nobody stirred until her sister calls down into the tunnel : ' @entity7 is here , this is where she lived with you , come and see her for the last time			2
' gradually they begin to emerge , weary - eyed in the bright light above ground , clutching @entity159 bags to steady their nerves			0
a gaggle of diseased and destitute individuals who have lost their way in life , gathering around the body of one of their own who had lost her life			0
we followed the group to the funeral where @entity7 ’s coffin was lowered into the ground			2
a small crowd surrounded her coffin , weeping and placing flowers over the casket			0
her family she was torn from as a baby and the homeless family that had welcomed her in - briefly united in a moment of tragedy			0
the next day we interviewed @entity308 , the director general of the @entity309 in @entity6 who told us : ' for them life no longer matters			2
they are outcasts , renegades that are avoided and they are primarily lacking love and understanding			0
it was n't their fault that they were born into this situation , or that they ended up in this situation			0
' the homeless and drug gangs enter the underworld via a hole in the pavement on a traffic island in front of the station we asked why more was n't done to intervene before @entity7 's death : ' as far as we know from the tunnels she did n't want to be brought in the daylight			1
her dying wishes , to die in the place where she had found family			0
' ms @entity308 says that they ca n't close the tunnels , for fear of pushing the vulnerable people who find sanctuary underground , into ever - more precarious places and situations			1
but she claims that @entity58 is banned from @entity6 , and has been removed several times before by the police			2
he just keeps on returning faster than the police return to take him away			0
today the tunnels alongside @entity6 's central station remain open for both business and sanctuary , attracting youngsters like @entity7 , who struggle to exist at the very bottom of @entity31 society			1
drug addiction and premature death the price paid for those who choose to live underground			2
watch ' @entity7 : a life lost in the @entity357 of @entity6 ' in a special report on @entity26 tonight at 7pm			1
the leader of the underground world , @entity58 , pays protection money to a local gang and also says addicts are less likely to die down in the tunnels because he offers them a sort of safety			1

drug addicts paid their last respects to @entity7 , an @entity4 victim who died in the underground tunnels below @entity6
she was dressed in a bridal gown , as is custom for *unmarried* @entity17 girls who die before they marry
pictures were captured by @entity26 who exposed the underground world last month
but authorities say they ca n't close the tunnels for fear of pushing vulnerable people into more precarious places
