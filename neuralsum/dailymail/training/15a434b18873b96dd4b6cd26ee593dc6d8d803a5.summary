a middle - aged woman and her son have been arrested after allegedly trying to take her husband to commit suicide in @entity5 , it emerged last night			2
the 65 - year - old woman and her 25 - year - old son are suspected of planning to admit the terminally ill man to the @entity10 clinic in @entity11 to die			1
the female pensioner , who comes from the @entity14 area of @entity15 , was held along with her son on suspicion of encouraging or assisting a suicide before being released on police bail			0
assisted suicide : a 65 - year - old wife and her son , 25 , are alleged to have planned to fly her 71 - year - old husband to this @entity10 clinic in @entity22 , near @entity11 , @entity5 , so he could end his own life so far no members of the family have been named by police and the older man ’s condition has not been revealed			1
but officers have said they are having the mental capacity of the ‘ vulnerable ’ 71 - year - old assessed to determine if he is able to make decisions for himself			1
yesterday a spokesman for @entity34 said : ‘ police have been made aware of suggestions that a man and a woman from @entity15 could be planning to take a vulnerable pensioner to go to the dignitas clinic in @entity5 so that he can end his life			0
‘ it is an offence to encourage or assist suicide under the @entity44			1
‘ our officers are investigating whether any crime has been committed or is likely to be committed if they do not take action			0
’ the spokesman added : ‘ we are currently having the mental capacity of the vulnerable 71 - year - old assessed in order to determine how able he is to make decisions for himself			1
ongoing investigation : @entity34 , headquarters pictured , are now investigating whether the 71 - year - old has the mental capacity to chose to end his life legal battle : @entity58 , 58 , who is paralysed from the neck down , lost is case arguing for the right to die earlier this month but has vowed to take his battle to the @entity63 ‘ the investigation is looking into what steps , if any , the suspects had made in taking the man out of the country			1
‘ if it is confirmed the man had the mental capacity to make decisions for himself then we would not be able to prevent him travelling			0
’ @entity73 , whose social workers know the family , are working with police on the case but said it would be ‘ inappropriate ’ to comment			0
however euthanasia campaigner @entity80 said : ‘ it is ridiculous for them to arrest anyone under these circumstances			0
‘ every year up to 30 people go to @entity5 with relatives and no action is ever taken against them			0
‘ to my knowledge nobody has been arrested in this situation for the last three years			0
’ although legal in @entity5 , assisted suicide is a criminal offence in the @entity93 and carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years			0
despite this , the @entity95 has made it clear that a person accompanying someone to a foreign country to commit suicide is unlikely to face prosecution			2
the guidelines clarifying the @entity93 ’s position on assisted suicide were issued in february 2010 by the director of public prosecutions @entity105 , @entity107			0
they indicate that anyone acting with compassion to help end the life of someone who has decided they can not go on would be unlikely to face criminal charges			2
and while assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in @entity118 and @entity119 , individual decisions on prosecution are based on the circumstances in each case			1
anguish : @entity123 , who had locked - in syndrome , is comforted by his wife last year after he is told the @entity126 decided a doctor is not allowed to help him end his life			2
he died shortly afterwards , but his family have continued the fight to have the law on assisted suicide clarified right - to - die fight : mr @entity123 , a father - of - two from @entity133 , @entity134 , was paralysed by a stroke while on a business trip to @entity137 in 2005 @entity10 has seen more than 1,100 deaths since it opened 14 years ago , including more than 150 @entity93 who have made the decision to commit suicide at its @entity11 clinic			1
a total of 200 people end their life there every year as assisted suicide is legal in @entity5 provided that the helper does not personally benefit from the death			0
and despite complaints about so - called ‘ suicide tourism ’ – 85 per cent of @entity11 voters rejected a call to end legalised assisted suicide in 2011 , while 78 per cent rejected a call to ban foreigners from going to the country to end their lives			2
in may this year it emerged that a retired professional man had become the first @entity93 dementia patient to end his life at the @entity10 clinic			1
the 83 - year - old chose to die because he did not want the symptoms of the disease to be able to progress any further			1

the 65 - year - old and her son , 25 , are accused of arranging to travel to a @entity10 clinic in @entity11 where the 71 - year - old could legally end his life
police are investigating if he has the mental capacity to decide for himself
it is a crime to encourage or assist a suicide in @entity118 and @entity119
but guidelines indicate anyone acting *compassionately* to help end the life of someone who *'s* decided they ca *n't* go on is unlikely to face prosecution
