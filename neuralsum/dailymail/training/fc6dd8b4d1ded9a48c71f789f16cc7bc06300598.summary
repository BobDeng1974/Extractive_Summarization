by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 15 april 2012 updated : 11:35 est , 15 april 2012 at one point they were so close they slept side by side , but @entity6 the black rhino has gone walkabout and his human pal is desperate to track down his two - tonne chum			1
@entity11 has put out an appeal for the missing rhinoceros who has known for more than a decade			2
the @entity15 says he developed a bond with the animal when he first stomped into his life at the age of two after being mauled by a rival rhino in @entity23 on @entity15 ’s western cape			1
just the two of us : @entity11 aboard black @entity26 who he developed a bond with after he helped to nurse him back to health the buffalo breeder then developed a bond with the leathery - skinned mammal during the years he spent nursing it back to health			1
the animal grew to trust mr @entity37 so much that he let him feed , ride and play with him			2
according to the rhino adopter @entity6 became so tame he would come like a puppy - dog when he was called by name and nuzzle him at the farm where he recovered			1
mr @entity37 said : ‘ when i went to visit him he immediately accepted me and i fell asleep outside his holding pen and woke up with him licking my hand			2
‘ he would come up and lie down next to me he knew me and was very affectionate			0
’ on the run : according to mr @entity53 became so tame he would come like a puppy - dog when he was called by name and nuzzle into him eventually returning to health , @entity26 was released into the wilds of the @entity23 in 2006			0
each year mr @entity37 would return to the reserve to track down and play with his friend as these images show			0
but it has now been nearly a year since he has been able to track @entity6			1
mr @entity37 added : ‘ he 's a wild rhino running around 4,000 hectares of bush			1
’ ‘ he was very curious last time i saw him - he recognised me and reacted to my presence ‘ i came up to him and scratched him and he scratched me back ‘ i saw his tracks a week ago but i did n't see him and he is hard to find now			0
’ hide and seek : mr @entity37 plays with @entity6 the two - tonne black rhino			1
mr @entity37 has put out an appeal to try and find his best pal @entity73 time : rhinoceroses are intelligent animals in their own right and mr @entity37 said @entity26 interacted with him on his own level rhinoceroses are intelligent animals in their own right and mr @entity37 said @entity26 interacted with him on his own level by bumping against him so he could climb on the rhino ’s back			2
he added : ‘ he would sometimes get excited and run towards me at full gallop in open savannah with something for me to climb up to get safely out the way			0
‘ so instead of worrying about dodging out the way i would swing onto his back			0
‘ he was only being playful and there was no aggression			0
’ mr @entity37 is eager to find his friend , who is now 12 , so he can finally mate			0
he believes the animal is timid around females after the traumatic injury he received from another bull when he was very young			2
but mr @entity37 said he is still determined to find a suitable mate for @entity6 before he is too old			1
‘ @entity95 are very intolerant of one another and will fight and even kill their own young			1
there are a lot of aggression issues but you need to find the right temperament , ’ he added			0
however the mission to mate @entity6 is a difficult one - the few black rhinos there are for sale can cost up to £ 150,000 and many are aggressive towards both males and females of the same species			1
‘ i 'm looking for the right personality in a female , between six and eight years old , ’ he said			0
‘ if she hates humans or rhinos we 've got a problem , you ca n't just nip off to @entity118 and grab one			0

@entity95 *originally* found after being mauled by a rival bull
owner fed , played and even rode @entity6 the black rhino
pair even slept next to each other at night
