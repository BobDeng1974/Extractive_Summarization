in her lawsuit , @entity9 had sought child support , private school and college tuition and payment of her legal bills			1
but last week , the teenager returned home with her tail between her legs after she dropped the case , and she was pictured outside the home with her parents			1

' following the dropped case , the lawyer representing @entity9 's parents held a press conference confirming that the family had been reunited , but would not say what had sparked it			1
' this is a long process , it 's only the beginning , ' @entity164 said , according to the @entity167			0
' this is a private matter			0
it should have never been brought to the court 's attention			0
it should have never been brought to the public			0

back home : @entity9 's parents have welcomed her back to their @entity191 , @entity1 home , pictured she argued that since her parents have a combined yearly income of between $ 250,000 and $ 300,000 , she was entitled to $ 654 - a - week in child support			1

her parents had claimed their daughter ran off to stay with friends when she turned 18 because she refused to abide by rules they had set down , including to stop dating her boyfriend			2
the judge clearly took a dim view of the lawsuit			0
he said : ' what kind of parents would the @entity210 be if they did n’t try to set down some strict rules ? emotional : both @entity14 and @entity214 began crying in the courtroom earlier this month as their lawyers explained that they had to enforce their rules with their often rebellious child no cares : @entity9 was seen with her friend @entity220 , whose family took her in and paid her legal fees ' i 'm not going to put myself in anyone 's shoes , he 's ( father @entity14 ) trying to raise a child			1
it 's clear to me all the positive qualities @entity9 obviously has , in terms of sports and academics , but i ’m not going to step on a father for how he tries to get his child on the right tracks when she has obviously come off the tracks , to put it mildly			2
' through the hearings , it was revealed that she previously threatened to sue a teacher for kicking her out of the @entity241 dance because he thought she was drunk			0
