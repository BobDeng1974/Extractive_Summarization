to some , the @entity0 is just a glorified food court with hungry truckers and greasy snacks			0
but for 21 - year - old @entity3 , the glass pavilion straddling the @entity5 in @entity6 means so much more - he claims it 's the site of his conception			1
so when news broke that the highway rest stop would close on sunday after more than 50 years to make way for new roads , the @entity10 resident handcuffed himself to a door in protest			1
' it is a weird story , i must admit , ' @entity3 said , according to @entity20 @entity19			2
' about 21 years ago , my parents were at a @entity23 concert here in @entity19 , and one thing led to another			1
they ended up at the oasis … and i was conceived there			0
' they were like , ’ oh yeah , hey , we never really told you how you were born , or your conception , ’ and my parents are weird people , so it ’s not that surprising , ' he said			0
while @entity3 's one - man protest on friday has received a lot of coverage from 103.9 the @entity58 radio station where he works , his parents ( unsurprisingly ) have not weighed in			1
the oasis , as it ’s known by locals , opened in 1959 and houses a customer service center , a @entity63 , gas station and numerous fast food joints			1
with its floor - to - ceiling glass windows and range of facilities , it 's a popular rest stop for travelers and concert - goers seeking a late night snack ... or anything else			0
but @entity73 reported the mega rest stop will close for good on sunday			0
it will be torn down to make room for the @entity78 's multibillion - dollar plans to add a fourth lane in each direction from @entity81 to @entity82 , and to connect the @entity83 with @entity84 and the @entity85 along @entity81 's western edge			0
expansion plans : the oasis will be closed on sunday as part of @entity78 's multibillion - dollar plan to add a fourth lane in each direction to the highway not just a truck stop : the oasis has been a popular rest stop for visitors and locals since it opened in 1959			2

@entity3 protested the closure of @entity31 on the @entity5 in @entity6
he handcuffed himself to a door for a day , claiming it had *sentimental* value
he said he was conceived there after his parents made their way home from a @entity23 concert 21 years ago
@entity3 works , from @entity10 , works for 103.9 the @entity58 radio station
the oasis , which opened in 1959 , houses a customer service center , a @entity63 and numerous fast food joints
it will close sunday *due* to plans to widen the road
