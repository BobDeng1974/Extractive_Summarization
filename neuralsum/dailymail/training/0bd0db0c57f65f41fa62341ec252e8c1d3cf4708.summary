by @entity0 published : 17:27 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 17:31 est , 28 august 2013 when it came to winning first prize , @entity1 thought the trophy for growing the largest pumpkin was his for the taking			1
at 1,500 - pounds and requiring a truck and crane to even move the fruit , mr @entity1 believed he had likely secured first prize a new @entity12 state record			1
but there was a hole in his plan			2
for despite months of tender , loving - care , all his work was for nothing after he noticed a thumb - sized hole at the bottom his gigantic pumpkin			1
pumped up : @entity1 poses next to his giant pumpkin in @entity12			1
@entity1 holds the record for giant pumpkins in @entity12 , and knew he had a candidate this year to beat the record of 1,287 pounds set by him in 2011 there 's a hole in my pumpkin ! when a boom truck gently lifted the behemoth , the big pumpkin revealed a big disappointment : a thumb - size hole that will make it ineligible for the competition at the @entity38 in @entity39 ‘ ‘ it ’s not going to count , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s a bummer , but it ’s the rules			0
’ the rules state that ‘ entries must be free of rot , holes and cracks that reach through to the cavity , chemical residues and serious soft spots			2
’ mr @entity1 is the current state record holder for giant pumpkin growing and his 1,287 - pound effort from 2011 will likely stand even after this year ’s competition at the @entity38 is over			2
‘ it ’s just killing him , ’ said @entity56 , @entity1 ’s sister - in - law told the @entity58			0
judging : the @entity38 pumpkin competition judging in @entity39 in full swing ( and sling ! ) winner : @entity66 's @entity65 who hauled in a pale orange 1,182 - pound monster for the top prize won this year - but he knows what @entity1 is feeling			2
he was disqualified a few years ago also for having a hole in his pumpkin ‘ he eats , sleeps and dreams pumpkins			1
all he does is pumpkins			0
’ mr @entity1 has gotten used to setting records for growing massive pumpkins			0
he set his first record in 2004 with a 700 - pounder and again in 2005 with a 942 - pound pumpkin			2
in 2006 , he grew the first @entity12 pumpkin to pass the 1,000 - pound mark and then set the current record in 2011 with an enormous 1,287 pounder			1
mr @entity1 was disqualified once before when a crack was discovered in one of his giants			0
he believes the hole that occurred this time around may have happened because it was growing ‘ too fast ’			2
operation : just getting the pumpkins to the state fair is quite an ordeal in itself ! better luck next year : the seeds from @entity1 enormous pumpkin will likely be auctioned off for other growers to use at one point , he was feeding the pumpkin 300 gallons of water a day and grew more 40 pounds in 24 hours			1
it took less than three months for the fruit to grow to its present size and started off about the size of a cherry tomato at the start of june			1
it ’s not clear what will become of the fruit			0
the seeds may go at auction for a few hundred dollars			0
there could be anywhere from zero to 900 inside in the end it was @entity66 's @entity65 who hauled in a pale orange 1,182 - pound monster for the top prize			0
he had sympathy for mr @entity1 position			0
just a couple of years ago mr @entity65 grew a pumpkin weighing 1,789 pounds but was disqualified for a small hole			1
‘ @entity0 had a bigger pumpkin , ’ @entity65 said			0
‘ i know what he 's feeling			0

pumpkin grew from the size of a cherry tomato to 1,500 pounds in less than three months
fruit grew so fast a hole formed and it was disqualified from entering the @entity12 state fair competition
this years winning pumpkin weighed 1,182 pounds
