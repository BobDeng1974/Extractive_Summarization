by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 so when did you think @entity3 would crumble on home territory at this @entity5 ? was it when @entity7 took a shock lead in @entity9 to stun the hosts on their big opening night ? what about when @entity14 keeper @entity13 kept everything fired at him out , or even when @entity16 equalised in the final group game ? there was of course when @entity20 hit the crossbar with victory in sight during the dying stages of @entity3 ’s last 16 clash , while local nerves were shredded after @entity27 pulled a goal back late on in the quarter - finals			1
@entity3 , of course , pulled through – they always do			0
no one should be surprised because keeping the @entity3 pinned in their own back yard when it matters most is something no team has done for an incredible 39 years			0
that long lasting run which spans 63 games is surely facing one of its biggest threats when @entity53 turn up for battle			2
@entity3 will be without star forward @entity68 through injury , while captain @entity70 is suspended for the clash with @entity73 ’s outfit – who in @entity74 will surely prove to be one of the biggest credible threats to the streak during those 39 years			2
as fate has it , it ’s @entity74 where this particular story starts			0
in the very same @entity84 ( albeit with a bit of revamp work these days ) where @entity53 will look to upset the locals , @entity81 did the very same back on september 30 , 1975			1
two goals in the final eight minutes helped them see off @entity3 3 - 1 in a first - leg @entity88 semi-final , a tie they would eventually win before going on to lift the trophy			1
it was a @entity3 team in transition – still a good side – but missing key men from the 1970 @entity5 winning team as well as proving slightly too early for the class of 1982			1
@entity49 will raise their game - @entity99 @entity100 man : @entity3 are looking to continue their amazing unbeaten record without injured talisman @entity68 expectation : @entity3 expect their national team to emerge victorious on home soil and lift the @entity5 the likes of @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 had all moved on , while the crop of @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 had yet to come through			1
typically @entity3 remained competitive during this period			0
the 1974 and 1978 @entity116 rewarded fourth and third place finishes respectively , while @entity3 also recorded two semi-final appearances in the @entity88			2
for all their undoubted improvement in class , even the stars of ’ 82 failed to match any of the 1970s performances , while the 1986 side fared little better as beaten quarter - finalists in @entity14			0
a year later , the @entity88 format changed to allow a host nation to stage all the games , but @entity3 were soon under pressure on home soil again when they hosted the tournament in 1989			1
@entity5 qualification @entity135 @entity134 @entity5 @entity136 @entity137 * results including penalty shootout , goals only @entity141 @entity88 @entity142 @entity143 @entity144 @entity145 @entity146 total : @entity147 w 45 d18 l0 @entity148 a less than vintage team stormed to victory unbeaten during the campaign and conceded just one goal in the process			1
home soil seemed to get the very best out of them because a last 16 exit at @entity160 ‘ 90 a year later was their worst @entity5 performance since a group stage exit in 1966			1
the build up to the 1994 @entity5 provided another setback , but only away from home as @entity3 lost their first ever @entity5 qualifier when @entity164 scored twice in the final two minutes to record a famous 2 - 0 win in 1993			1
losing the odd qualifier then became regular for @entity3 but none were on their territory			0
even the side that limped into the 2002 @entity5 that suffered a record six defeats were bullet proof on home turf			2
last year ’s @entity144 was another home obstacle easily overcome with five straight victories			0
these are not poor teams that @entity3 are playing against neither			0
@entity178 , @entity27 and @entity179 are for instance regular visitors but simply can not get the job done in @entity3 ’s backyard , while @entity186 champions @entity184 and world champions @entity183 also offered little resistance			0
in an even bigger sign of what ’s to come , it ’s not just competitive games where @entity3 are so strong at home			2
@entity194 : @entity3 highlights easy does it : @entity196 celebrates scoring the opening goal in last year 's @entity144 final win against @entity183 sealed with a kiss : @entity38 kisses the @entity144 trophy after @entity3 recorded five straight wins the @entity202 are unbeaten in their last 42 international matches on home soil in all games , since losing 1 - 0 in a friendly match in @entity207 against @entity208 in august 2002			1
@entity53 ’s chances of ending this formidable home streak are arguably higher for them than it has been for any other team during this 39 - year period			2
but they will need to find something extra in the tank to slay a @entity3 side who somehow , someway , always stop their opponents from leaving their country with all the glory			0
@entity223 can be replaced - ronaldo			0

@entity3 have not lost a competitive game on home soil since 1975
the @entity3 lost 3 - 1 to @entity81 in the first leg of their @entity88 semi-final
@entity53 will aim to end that record when they meet @entity52 's side in @entity74
the hosts have won four and drawn one ( including one penalty shootout victory ) of their five @entity5 games so far
