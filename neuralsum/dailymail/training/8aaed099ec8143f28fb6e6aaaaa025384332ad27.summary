the amount of new customers more accustomed to luxury goods who shop there now had has forced the store to produce a range of deluxe products			0
@entity151 , the youngest @entity152 chef to win a @entity154 star , has been employed to come - up with a @entity6 menu based on the @entity142 range			2
they are set to take on the upmarket likes of @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity13 's - at a fraction of the cost			1
@entity142 said that it had greatly expanded its luxury range ' due to customer demand			0
' the budget chain says @entity6 would not be the same for the middle classes without ' affordable luxury '			2
so @entity151 - who has cooked for @entity168 - has produced recipes that include reindeer , lobsters , goose , pheasant and partridges			0
@entity6 favourite : @entity37 sprouts have risen 42 % in price from last year - but will still fly off the shelves ' this year we have expended our deluxe range due to customer demand , ' said a spokesman for @entity142			1
' it is a reflection of our growing customer base			0
' they seem to be going down well with customers - where else can you get a lobster for the price we sell at ? it is luxury at affordable prices and @entity151 has worked with that for this year 's festive guide			2
' as mentioned earlier , people are already beginning to make their @entity6 preparations with sales of puddings up 62 per cent from a similar time last year			2
mince pie sales are up 32 per cent and @entity6 chocolate selection boxes are up 42 per cent			2
these figures come from @entity160 but are likely to be replicated across other stores , which are also stocking @entity6 foods and giving away festive carrier bags			0
on sale : @entity6 puddings are being snapped up weeks in advance - last year they were hot property the increase in sales seems to have been driven by retailers starting their @entity6 sales push earlier than ever			0
@entity215 began selling @entity6 - themed confectionary as early as august 29 , sparking something of a backlash			0
separately , advertising watchdogs have received complaints from parents unhappy that early marketing is encouraging children to pester them far in advance of december 25			0
@entity160 began selling @entity6 lines on september 24 , which was not long after many families had returned from their summer holidays .			0
