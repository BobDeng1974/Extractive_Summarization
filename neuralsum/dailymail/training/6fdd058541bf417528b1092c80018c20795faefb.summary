a man who who was fined for refusing to cut back ivy and weeds he let grow on his house for ten years has finally cut them off			1
@entity6 , 50 , left the plants to grow for so long that the house was virtually hidden from neighbours			1
it became so overrun that his chimney could not be seen over the foliage			2
and the wilderness extended so far forward from the house , in a cul - de - sac in @entity16 , @entity17 , that the shape of the building could no longer be made out from the pavement			1
@entity6 , 50 , has finally trimmed the hedge ( left ) that engulfed his house ( right ) after ten years before : mr @entity6 was fined £ 1,000 by @entity23 after refusing to trim his home on council orders after : ten months on , the house has become visible after mr @entity6 cut back the ivy and weeds but , despite the fact the roof and first - floor windows were entirely hidden under the ivy , mr @entity6 continued to live in the house with his wife , @entity33 , 50			1
then , in february this year , he was fined £ 1,000 at @entity34 ’ @entity23 after ignoring council orders to trim it			1
almost a year on , he appears to have finally complied with the order , and the house can now be seen in full			1
council planning officer @entity39 said mr @entity6 had been ordered to get rid of the ivy from the front of the property , including the windows and doors			1
he was also told to remove all vegetation from his garage roof at the back of the house and to clear the front lawn			2
despite the fact the roof and first - floor windows were completely covered , the @entity50 lived in the house the family were able to access the house , with the front door visible underneath the foliage he said : ‘ basically he has been told to make it look how you would expect a house to look - at the moment you ca n’t tell whether you ’re looking at the front or the back of the building			1
’ the breakthrough will come as a relief to neighbours who have described the ' nightmare ' of living next to him and expressed surprise that the couple and their daughter were not embarrassed by its appearance			2
@entity78 described the nightmare of living on the same street as the father - of - one			2
@entity81 , 35 , said : ‘ it ’s a relief he ’s shaved it off , that was an eyesore to live next to for so long			1
‘ i do n’t know how they lived in there , must have cost a fortune in lighting			2
‘ the windows were completely obscured , i wonder if he ’ll leave it now again or keep it trimmed			0
’ then first floor windows in the house are now visible after the plant growth was trimmed this year one resident , who did not wish to be named , said in february : ' that thing brings down the house prices for all our street - it 's an eyesore ' one resident , who did not wish to be named , said in february : ‘ that thing brings down the house prices for all our street – it ’s an eyesore , i do n’t know how they can live in there			1
‘ whenever i see someone emerge from that mess i do a double take , they must either live in complete darkness or spend a fortune on lighting			0
they added : ‘ it ’s crazy how they could let their property get into such a mess			0
it ’s a nightmare to live by			0
' their daughter has gone off to university - i ca n’t imagine her coming back , that ’s an embarrassing place to bring your friends or boyfriend back to			0
' another neighbour added : ‘ @entity125 ’s a real character , a bit of a rebel without a cause			0
i do like him , but he lives by his own rules			0
‘ it would be a bit off - putting for potential buyers wanting to move in next door			0
he ’s been locked in a wrangle with the council for a while now			0
‘ but he ’s a decent bloke really - once that ivy takes hold it ’s a big job to shift it			0
you ’ve got to feel for him in a way			0
