dwindling numbers : the archbishop of @entity2 , dr @entity3 , holds the @entity4 , which celebrates its 400th anniversary this year			2
he has been urged by @entity6 to speak up for @entity7 @entity7 is slowly , but surely losing ground in @entity9 and @entity10 , according to an official survey yesterday			1
the number who declare themselves to be @entity15 has dropped by nearly 10 per cent in five years , while the number of non-believers is growing			1
the state research into race and religion also showed that @entity15 are less than half as likely to attend a place of worship as followers of other traditions			1
the @entity26 showed that @entity7 remains the faith of the great majority of the population			2
but its share dropped from 77 per cent to 70 per cent between 2005 and 2010			2
over the same period the numbers who say they have no religion went up from 15 per cent to 21 per cent			0
the findings were published days after @entity6 ’s speech on the importance of @entity7 to @entity37 , in which he urged the @entity38 and its leader , the archbishop of @entity2 , to take a lead in restoring moral values			1
the @entity26 is the sixth and last in its ten - year history			0
@entity43 launched the research effort in 2001 in the hope of charting levels of prejudice and neighbourhood tensions and finding ways to help ease them			0
communities secretary @entity50 ordered the end of the project earlier this year because ministers considered the £ 4million cost of each survey could not be justified			2
the findings were based on questionnaires answered by 10,000 people , with further groups of 5,000 ethnic minority members and 1,200 @entity61 consulted to shore up findings among smaller groups of the population			0
losing faith ? @entity66 ( above ) is the mother church of the @entity68 and seat of the archbishop of @entity2			0
but its significance appears to be diminishing as fewer people are declaring themselves @entity15 questions covered issues including fear of crime , giving to charity , the state of neighbourhoods and experiences of the downturn as well as matters of religion and race			1
the results on the decline of @entity7 come at a time when many @entity15 feel that equality laws are attacking some of their core beliefs			1
four test cases on the rights of @entity15 , including two involving people refused the right to wear crucifixes at work and two which centre on @entity15 who refused to acknowledge same - sex relationships , are to be decided by the @entity99 in coming weeks			1
the report said : ‘ while @entity7 remained the most prevalent faith in @entity9 and @entity10 , between 2005 and 2010 there was a steady decrease in the proportion of people who identified themselves as @entity15			1
‘ christian people were much less likely than all the other main religions to say that they practised their religion , while @entity61 people were most likely to practise their religion			2
’ disillusioned : the apparent decline of the faith comes as many @entity15 believe their core beliefs , such as being able to wear crucifixes at work , are coming under fire from equality laws however there were signs that , as @entity15 numbers dwindled , their commitment increased			1
a third of @entity15 said they went to church regularly			1
the figure was 33 per cent , up from 31 per cent in 2005			0
urging action : mr @entity6 spoke out recently to stress the importance of @entity7 to help restore moral values fewer than half the population now think racial prejudice is on the increase			1
in the two years to 2010 , numbers who believe racism is getting worse went down from 56 per cent to 47 per cent			0
the authors of the survey , produced by the @entity137 , said : ‘ the positive shifts over time were generally observed across all ethnic and religious groups , and were often most pronounced among minority groups			2
’ seven per cent of the whole population thought racial or religious harassment was a problem in their neighbourhood , and 4 per cent of people had actually experienced racial bullying , in most cases consisting of verbal abuse			0
this was down from 5 per cent in the previous year			0
asian people broadly said they had suffered less racial harassment over the past two years			0
for example , among @entity155 the numbers who said they had experienced racial harassment in the past two years dropped from 20 per cent in 2009 to 13 per cent last year			0
however , @entity159 and @entity160 said their experience of racial harassment had risen .			0

@entity15 also less likely to attend place of worship *compared* to other religions , state survey reveals
comes days after @entity6 urged @entity38 to restore moral values
