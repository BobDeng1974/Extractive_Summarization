by @entity0 the internet has fuelled a rise in sexism and is teaching young boys to think sex should be ‘ graphic and violent ’ , one of the @entity8 ’s top presenters has warned			1
@entity9 , who co-hosts @entity10 , said teenage girls who have sex are now ‘ slut shamed ’ by their peers as youngsters become increasingly vicious online			1
and instead of being given proper sex education by their parents , most of what boys now learn about relationships comes from pornography and violent video games such as @entity23 @entity9 , who co-hosts @entity10 , said the internet has fuelled a rise in sexism and is teaching young boys to think sex should be ' graphic and violent ' miss @entity9 , 59 , has investigated the rise in sexism for a new @entity29 documentary , to be screened on thursday			1
the presenter said she uncovered evidence the internet has made us more tolerant of sexist humour , including jokes about rape , leading to a ‘ new coarseness ’ in the way the sexes interact			1
she told @entity40 ’s @entity41 : ‘ for teenagers now , the internet is as real as the air as they breathe			1
it is a place without morality			2
‘ it is hellish for young boys right now			2
i asked one boy whether he talked to his parents about sex and he looked at me as if i was mad			2
why are n’t parents talking to their kids about sex ? what he was learning about sex he was learning from his peer group and he was learning from porn			1
‘ if all you know about sex is graphic sex , some of it violent , how do you form meaningful relationships ? ’ miss @entity9 , who has two grown - up children of her own , said the internet ‘ multiplies ’ sexism because it encourages people to gather in tribes and target others with cruel abuse			1
miss @entity9 , who has two grown - up children of her own , said the internet ' multiplies ' sexism because it encourages people to gather in tribes and target others with cruel abuse in one new phenomenon , known as ‘ slut shaming ’ , women who show any sexual independence are humiliated on websites such as @entity80 and @entity81			1
she said : ‘ the victims , who are now ‘ slut shamed ’ and humiliated , are the ones who feel the effect – and it ’s damaging the next generation by giving them a skewed idea of what prejudice actually is			0
‘ @entity93 is there in full force , along with a rise in people being overtly vicious			2
' for older generations , the internet can feel similar to simply ‘ pub talk ’ – it ’s something external – but for young people , the web is part of the discourse of how they live their lives			2
‘ we ’re now fully in the age of the internet			2
and it appears to be amplifying misogyny			0
’ miss @entity9 also said the internet has fuelled a rise in sexist humour , which makes us more tolerant towards misogyny in our everyday lives			1
she said : ‘ @entity117 has shown that if you are listening to sexist humour and are sexist you will be more likely to display sexist humour in your everyday life			0
' if you are not sexist and you listen to sexist humour and you laugh , you wo n’t become sexist , but you will egg the ones on who are sexist			0
‘ i was also very shocked by the extent to which some of our best known comedians use rape humour			0
in what circumstances is rape funny ? i find that quite extraordinary			0
‘ when i interview comedians and they say everyone ’s fair game and the whole point about comedy is that it ’s free speech , it breaks taboos			0
but there is no taboo around rape , we know rape is awful , we know there ’s no excuse for rape			0
why make jokes about rape ? ’ miss @entity9 also hit out at ‘ cynical ’ companies which create online porn and violent video games such as @entity23 , in which players are encouraged to kill virtual characters			1
‘ if all you know about sex is graphic sex , some of it violent , how do you form meaningful relationships ? ’ @entity9 she said : ‘ it is a huge selling game made by very brilliant programmers and a brilliant games company , but as far as i am concerned you do n’t have to go to the place in the game where you pay a prostitute , you have sex whatever way you want to have sex with her , which is very graphically detailed			1
‘ then in the game if you attack her and stamp on her and kill her you get your money or your points back in the game			0
the defence is you do n’t have to play that part of the game			0
so why is it there ? what makes it so exciting , what makes it such a crucial bit of your enjoyment ? ’ she added : ‘ my naivety was i thought in the @entity192 it was the start of this onward progress and the relationship between the sexes would be better			0
a lot of the times they are , but some of the times they are not			0
we ’re going through a bad moment and i hope we find our way out of it			0
