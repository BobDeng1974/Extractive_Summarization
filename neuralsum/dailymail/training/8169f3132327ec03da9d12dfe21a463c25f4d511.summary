by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 12:11 est , 12 march 2014 astronauts are often thought to be superhuman , defying death every day while they hurtle around @entity4 at 17,500 miles per hour in reality , however , the day to day life of an astronaut on board the @entity6 can , for long stretches , be mind - numbingly dull			1
from reporting food packaging mistakes to tackling problems of urinating , what occupies an astronauts mind is often less exciting than you might think			2
@entity18 , an @entity19 mechanical engineer and @entity21 astronaut , does some sewing while onboard the @entity6 anonymous journal entries , released by @entity21 , have been described as similar to ' gossip columns ' rather than the serious issues discussed in @entity27 ’s @entity26			1
one of the clearest topics that occupied the minds of those on board the @entity6 were frustrations with everyday tasks			1
‘ it was a frustrating day , ’ wrote one astronaut			1
‘ the urine collection started disastrously first thing this morning			2
‘ i think i got about 75 per cent in the bag ; the rest was all over me			2
not a good way to start the day			2
’ @entity42 , the former commander on the @entity6 , pictured playing with water and the lack of gravity ' interesting , how you can be on top of the world one moment ( literally ) and then be completely demoralised the next , because of what is said on the ground			1
' ' sunday is meant to be a day of rest , but somehow @entity53 managed to make it feel like monday			0
' ' i was awakened in the middle of the night by the ground telling me to close the shutter on the lab window			0
it is beyond me why it could n't wait until wake - up time			1
' an analysis by journalist @entity63 of @entity64 identified several major themes from these entries , including complaints about @entity53 , an obsession with food and homesickness			1
but what really stuck out was the banality of day to day activities			0
‘ one last funny story – during the first month of our stay , i noted that the labelling on two types of food packets were backwards , ’ said one entry			0
‘ today i wanted chicken teriyaki			0
so , i gambled that the labelling problem had not fixed for the new batch of food that came up recently , and selected “ @entity85 ”			0
' ‘ i was rewarded for not having overestimated @entity21 ! the chicken was in the packages labelled beef			0
’ the crew writings , however , were more than just an exercise in maintaining a diary of daily thoughts and events			1
by looking at their entries , researchers were able to gain insights into the mental and emotional well - being of the astronauts			1
' it comes out looking like a gossip column , i 'm sure , ' said astronaut @entity102 before she arrived at the space station			1
' but the point is to identify characteristics that will make expeditions successful			0
' @entity108 cosmonaut @entity107 gives @entity21 astronaut @entity109 a hair trim on board the @entity6 @entity112 of @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115 , was the first to suggest astronauts keep a diary as part of a scientific experiment			1
he was inspired by the logs and journals of polar explorers and diaries from occupants in the @entity125 and in @entity126			0
‘ studying small groups living and working in isolation and confinement is much like studying social issues with a microscope , ’ said professor @entity112			0
‘ there is much that can be learned from the approach that is relevant to nearly all human experience			0
’ it also proved to be a cathartic experience for many of the astronauts on board			0
anonymous journal entries , released by @entity21 , have shown how they read more like gossip columns than @entity27 's @entity26 ‘ with time on my hands for half an hour , i feel slightly melancholy , for some reason , ’ one astronaut wrote			1
‘ this happens quite often in space , among astronauts in general ( and cosmonauts ) , and space seems to somehow amplify our emotions , positive or negative , however they might be			0
‘ maybe it is the remoteness , or the beautiful scene outside , or a consciousness that we are in a unique situation , benefiting from the work of others			0
’ the thoughts and experiences contained in the writings remained anonymous ; only the individual keeping the journal and the investigator had access to the documents			1
but while they may reveal the banality of life on the @entity6 , they also highlight its incredible beauty			0
‘ i think i 'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to understand what i saw here every day for six months , ’ wrote one astronaut			1
‘ the view is awe - inspiring and beyond comprehension			1
’ the concept of a ' day ' aboard an orbiting spacecraft is a abstract : every 24 hours , astronauts on board the @entity6 will experience 15 dawns as the station speeds around the world			1
in a blog post while he was onboard the @entity6 < astronaut @entity189 addressed the topic of timekeeping and the challenge of balance			2
' when humans venture into a harsh wilderness , the fraction of time on task shrinks , while the effort to simply be there grows , ' said @entity189			0
' you are lucky to log six hours of mission tasking and six hours of sleep			0
the rest of the time is spent simply trying to stay alive			0
' when there are no immediate dangers , the crew focuses on scheduled workloads and daily routines			2
the breakdown may vary from day - to - day , but in general includes a 1 - hour meeting with mission control , a 12 - hour workday , a second 1 - hour mission control tag up , and an hour to finalise tasks before dinner			1
@entity217 leep and personal time fall within the remainder of the 24 - hour day			2
within the 12 - hour working day , there is a further breakdown of tasks			1
in general , this comes to 6.5 hours on primary mission tasks , such as research , operations , and maintenance			2
the crew members also spend 2.5 hours on physical training for both research goals and their own health			0
what time remains is quickly consumed by preparations for the primary tasks , unplanned repairs , and general upkeep to maintain smooth conditions throughout the mission .			2

themes that emerged include frustration with daily tasks and missing @entity4
