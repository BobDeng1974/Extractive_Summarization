years ago , when our house was always full of small children , i staggered downstairs with a couple of fellow mothers after a chaotic communal bath - time and found the visiting dads pouring well - earned drinks			1
we reported that , just before we battened down the hatches , all the three and four - year - old boys had been snapping at their pyjama elastic and comparing the size of their willies			1
so did the fathers , for a brief moment , but then , in chorus , they ask ™ ed : ‘ um			1
? ’ civilized , cultured , happily married men , not a porn - hound or a libertine among them , but they could n’t help it			1
@entity23 - worship , willy - pride , is hard - wired deep in the male brain			1
however much they deny it , men do seem to care			1
actors @entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) were subject to much speculation and discussion after their stark - naked performances as @entity34 a few years ago why else would @entity35 have bothered to trot around 15,000 men with a tape measure ( one hopes not the hard , cold , sharp steel sort ) and proudly report that the average length , unstimulated , is 3.6 in and 5.16 in erect			1
i do admire the chaps ’ willingness to collaborate in that measurement in the presence of a researcher with a white coat and a ruler			1
but the very fact that 15,000 men were happy to go through this bizarre academic exercise shows that they mind about their little friends			1
and that they all secretly , privately hoped that their willy would be bigger than average			1
the academics explain that it ’s all about ‘ using the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position ’ , and that it will be very helpful to worried guys with body dysmorphic disorder , and to those prone to ordering the wrong size of prophylactic online			1
so , do n’t tell me men do n’t care			1
further evidence was provided when some of us managed to see both versions of the astonishing @entity34 play at the @entity76 a few years ago , in which on alternate nights the role of the @entity78 , stark - naked during a long opening scene , was taken by @entity30 and @entity29			1
conversations between the male viewers who saw both were predictable , centring on who won that particular contest , and including the immortal line in a theatre - bar argument			1
‘ ah yes , i see what you mean , but is it a show - er or a grower ? ’ we women edged away , to continue our serious analysis of which of the buff actors made the most alluring and convincing monster and which was best at being @entity99			1
@entity100 says she blames author , @entity101 ( pictured ) , for giving men the impression that women are worried about size though to be fair , some of the girls were admiring the surrounding abs , pecs , and glutes			2
we do like a man who looks healthy			2
it ’s a primitive need in the female to bond with a man who is going to be able to take the bins out unaided			2
but honestly , hand on heart , i suspect that very few of us during early courtship — or afterwards , or even after the golden wedding — are particularly worried about whether we are getting the full 3.6in average			1
the idea that we are waiting with a ruler and a scornful frown for the kecks to come off is miles from reality			2
i blame author @entity101 for giving men that impression , with all her crazed descriptions of things rearing up like the @entity131 , or space shuttles , or — my least favourite — a ‘ joyous otter ’			2
i suppose the trouble is that writing sex scenes you have few choices			2
you can resort to heavy innuendo , or do some @entity141 stuff about being carried away to heaven on wings of bliss			2
or you can throw in the towel and pretend the female eye will only be delighted by the spectacle of something that would fit neatly into the @entity150 or @entity151 skyline , somewhere between @entity152 and the @entity153			2
though ideally , of course , not the @entity154			0
the porn industry is obsessed with size , but anyone with half a brain and heart knows porn has little to do with the reality of lovemaking			0
most of us have never cared about size			0
we do n’t carry on like the fearsome coven on tv ’s @entity168 , shriekingly comparing notes in the back of taxis or skinny - muffin cafes			0
it is worth noting , without comment , that much of the genius behind those series and films came from — ahem — men			0
gay men , in many cases			0
out here in the real world , that is not the way women carry on			0
the only ones i ’ve ever known talk about male size were sad , angry girls , unhappy in themselves about their failure to bond happily with any of the possessors of the said tackle			0
@entity100 is keen to point out that most women do n't carry on like the women in @entity168 ( pictured ) , comparing detailed notes on the men they know what we like is much harder to measure			0
i know a lot of women , and have been one for ages , and it ’s simpler than you think			0
we like hugs , we like tenderness , we like men who seem ( often bafflingly ) to be delighted and aroused by the very sight of us , even without make - up and a heavy cold			0
we really like to be laughed into bed and treated with affectionate consideration once we ’re there			0
we like men who think our enjoyment is at least half the point of the exercise , if not a bit more			0
we approve of chaps , of any dimension , who work out how to make the main event fun all round			0
we like men who chat and do n’t mind being rolled over when they snore or hauled around when they have hogged the duvet			0
we like faithfulness and kindness , and a man who loves to cuddle the baby even when it ’s leaking a bit			0
and we really like it when they grow out of caring about the 3.6in , or expecting it to be worshipped .			0
