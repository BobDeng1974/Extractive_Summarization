@entity0 this afternoon issued a dramatic public apology to the victims of the @entity5 @entity4 bombing for mistakes in a government scheme which allowed suspected perpetrators to escape justice			1
the former prime minister told victims that he ' took full responsibility ' for a programme which saw around 200 ' comfort letters ' sent to fugitive terror suspects assuring them they would not face prosecution			1
the letters came to light last year following the collapse of the trial of former @entity5 paramilitary @entity20 - the main suspect for the 1982 @entity22 bombing which killed @entity23 11 soldiers			1
he said : ' if i had been saying we are not dealing with this in any way at all , you can never be certain of these things but i think it is likely that the process would have collapsed			0
' the purpose on everything we have done was to create peace in @entity47 so that there were not more victims of terrorism and more families distressed and losing loved ones as a result of that terrorism			2
' the former pm began the peace process scheme in 2000 which eventually saw 95 of the letters issued by the government to suspects linked by intelligence to almost 300 murders			1
they told people they were not wanted at that time but did not rule out future prosecutions if new evidence became available			0
the scheme was drawn up following pressure from @entity70 to allow the fugitives , who had they been in prison before 1998 would have been released under the @entity74 , to return to @entity47			2
mr @entity0 said he was sorry for mistakes in the scheme which saw letters sent to terror suspects who the police were still perusing			1
but said he would not apologise to those who should have received the letters - those who were no longer wanted on terror offences			0
he said : ' i accept full responsibility , because i was prime minster , for not having put in place the structure for this procedure that might have meant in the @entity20 case ... that the letter would not have been sent and therefore the trial would have proceeded			0
mr @entity0 added : ' i am sorry for those people and i apologise to those people who have suffered as a result of that			2
but i am not going to apologise for sending those letters to those who should have received those letters , because without having done that , we would not have a @entity47 peace process			1
these people have suffered enormously from what has happened			0
' he later said : ‘ something obviously went wrong because there were large numbers of people who said this person was still wanted and the letter was still send			0
everybody has admitted that , as the judge said , a catastrophic error was made			0
’ the former prime minister left after a marathon parliamentary grilling by mps on the @entity47 @entity116 the comfort letters scheme was drawn up following pressure from @entity70 to allow the fugitives , who had they been in prison before 1998 would have been released under the @entity74 , to return to @entity47 the former pm had earlier been accused of being ' extremely disrespectful ' to @entity123 by repeatedly ducking requests to appear in front of the committee			1
in a letter sent last month , he wrote that he had ' nothing to say which will be new to you , the members of your committee or the people of @entity47			2
' the committee has spent more than six months attempting to question mr @entity0 over the secret deals that he made with @entity70			1
after failing to get mr @entity0 's agreement , the committee summoned him to appear			1
in a letter to mr @entity136 chair @entity139 said : ' you have been in the @entity23 regularly over the past few weeks , but you have not been able to find an hour or so to meet us			0
' @entity144 mp @entity143 had accused the former pm of ' being on the run ' from giving evidence			0
the review was commissioned by @entity149 following the collapse of the trial of @entity20 - accused of being responsible for 1982 bombing			2
during the case , it emerged that mr @entity20 had been given a letter assuring him that he would not face prosecution			0
a three - month inquiry into the ' comfort letters ' , led by @entity159 , concluded that the scheme was not unlawful			1
instead , she said that there had been cases where ' not wanted ' notices were issued to the wrong parties			0
former prime minister @entity0 leaves his office in central @entity22 to answer questions at the parliamentary inquiry into the ' on the runs ' the ex @entity171 leader arrived at the @entity173 this afternoon to give evidence about on - the - run letters the review was commissioned by @entity149 following the collapse of a trial involving a suspect in a bombing carried out by the @entity5 in @entity4 in 1982			1
pictured , the bodies of dead horses , covered by blankets , lay on the ground after the explosion in @entity4 killed members of the @entity186 mr @entity20 was released last year when a judge halted his prosecution for the @entity4 bombing			1
@entity192 lieutenant @entity191 ' @entity190 , 23 , died in the explosion in @entity4 on july 20 1982 alongside trooper @entity193 , 19 , lance corporal @entity194 , 19 , and 36 - year - old squadron quartermaster corporal @entity195			0
former @entity47 secretary @entity196 has said the issue of on - the - runs started the day he was appointed in 1999 and mainly concerned @entity70 's @entity199			0
ms @entity199 , the party 's representative to the @entity201 , is one of the most high - profile fugitive republicans , having skipped bail to the @entity204 in 1972 after her arrest in connection with the attempted murder of a soldier			0
@entity70 has argued that those covered by the letters scheme supported the peace process			1
last year the @entity212 complained that mr @entity0 in effect had ' refused ' to appear before the inquiry in person to answer questions about his government 's role .			2
