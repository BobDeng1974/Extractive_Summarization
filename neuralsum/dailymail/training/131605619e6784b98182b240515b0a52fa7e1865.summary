a museum which yesterday became the victim of one of the biggest art heists in history has admitted that there were no guards on duty at the time			2
seven paintings worth around £ 100million , including works by @entity10 and @entity11 , were stolen from the @entity12 in the @entity14 city of @entity15 after thieves broke in at 3am			1
the gang managed to bypass the sophisticated alarm system , in what police say was a well - prepared robbery			0
‘ those thieves got one hell of a haul , ’ he added			0
the paintings included @entity11 ’s @entity40 and @entity41 ( both 1901 ) , @entity10 ’s @entity42 ( 1971 ) , @entity44 ’s @entity43 ( 1919 ) and @entity46 ’s @entity45 ( 2002 )			1
@entity48 ’s girl in @entity49 ( 1898 ) and @entity51 ’s @entity50 ( 1890 ) were also taken			0
@entity14 police confirmed a total of seven paintings were stolen from a museum exhibition showcasing a private collection of over 150 exhibits , and had only been open for a few days			1
the theft is one of the art world 's most dramatic in recent years , and one of the biggest ever in the @entity14			2
@entity62 , a spokesman for @entity15 police , said they received a call alerting them to the theft at around 3 a.m. local time on tuesday			1
investigation : evidence is secured inside the museum from the privately owned exhibition on display at @entity12 where a total of seven paintings disappeared invaluable : the works stolen were on display at the @entity77 show featuring paintings from the @entity80 collection including work by @entity44 , @entity10 and @entity46 ‘ the alarm system in the @entity12 was supposed to be @entity83 , ’ @entity62 said			1
‘ somehow the people responsible for this found a way in and a way out and they found time to take seven paintings			2
so that 's something that is part of our investigation right now			0
’ the paintings stolen include two @entity11 's : ' @entity41 ' and ' @entity40 ' , part of his famous @entity95 series			1
also taken were @entity10 's ' @entity96 ' , @entity44 's ' @entity97 en @entity98 ' and @entity46 's ' @entity99 ' , @entity48 's ' @entity102 une @entity101 dite @entity100 ' and @entity103 's ' @entity50 '			1
@entity104 , chairman of @entity105 's in @entity106 , said the paintings would be worth ‘ more than several million euros , ’ with the @entity10 the best known of the stolen works			1
‘ it 's all about name and fame			0
so the @entity10 is the best known			1
the least well - known is @entity51 , which looks like a @entity48 , so maybe it was a mistake , ’ he added			0
stolen : @entity11 's @entity40 was one of the paintings taken last night painted by masters : woman with eyes closed by @entity46 and @entity96 by @entity10 famous : @entity41 by @entity11 is part of the @entity122 impressionists @entity95 series @entity104 said the art heist was one of the biggest in the country , but ‘ not as big as @entity133 ’ , referring to the work by @entity128 , a version of which was stolen from a museum in @entity132 in 2004 but later recovered			1
in 2010 , five paintings were stolen from the @entity135 in @entity136 including a @entity10 and @entity44 and estimated to be worth a combined $ 124 million			1
however there is hope for a swift recovery of the stolen pieces as experts said it would be next to impossible for the thieves to sell such well - known works on the open market			2
‘ they are going to learn very quickly that these things can not be sold , ’ said @entity145 , executive director of @entity146 , which helps track down stolen works of art. ‘ they do n't even think about it sometimes			2
they may try and call and entice a ransom			0

‘ i 'm confident these will find their way back ’ " he said			0
‘ the police in this area are very good , very well organised			0
i would not be surprised to see them surfacing over the next few weeks			0
’ the @entity12 exhibition , displaying a large part of the @entity80 's avant - garde collection for the first time in one gallery , opened a few days ago to celebrate @entity12 's 20th anniversary			0
