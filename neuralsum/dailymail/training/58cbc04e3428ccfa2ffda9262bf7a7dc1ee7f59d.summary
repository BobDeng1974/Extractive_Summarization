@entity3 's dead body could be locked away in a funeral home for months and the star 's children may never know where he is to be buried , his family told @entity8 today			1
a spokesman for the family said they fear his body is being stored in a funeral home in @entity14 while his widow @entity15 ' plays games ' with other family members that she has been at war with during @entity3 's last few years of his life			1
there is no time limit to how long he can be kept in the undignified state and @entity15 has sole control of his remains and is under no obligation to tell anyone where he is or what she intends to do with them			2
mystery : @entity3 's body is believed to be in @entity14 but the only person who knows for sure is his wife @entity15			1
a spokesman at the funeral home stated on his death certificate would not confirm he is there war : @entity39 has been fighting a very public battle against @entity15 , claiming she was guilty of elder abuse of the star			1
her spokesman today said she fears she will never know where her father is to be buried a spokesperson for the family said today : ' at this point we believe that @entity3 's body is at a funeral home in @entity14 , although it 's difficult to be 100 % sure , our fear is that @entity15 plans to keep @entity3 there for months while she plays her games			1
ultimately our worry is that we may never know where @entity3 is to be buried			0
' @entity3 ’s body is understood to be in @entity14 , @entity57 , after it was apparently shipped there on july 14 - a month after his death - by @entity15 against the wishes of most of his family			1
but there is confusion over what happened next			0
the funeral director from @entity66 , @entity67 , who sent the body and his counterpart in @entity14 have both denied they are responsible			1
@entity3 was one of the most beloved broadcasters of his generation and was the host of the long running ' @entity75 ' , as well as the voice of @entity77 in the cartoon series @entity79			0
he died at the age of 82 at @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity67 , having been suffering from dementia			0
@entity15 , his second wife of 34 years , had already been embroiled in a bitter row with his three children from his first marriage who alleged that she was guilty of elder abuse by not providing him with adequate care in his final months			1
after @entity3 ’s death his daughter @entity39 won a restraining order from a @entity96 judge to stop his body being cremated			1
but as she went to serve it at the @entity99 in @entity66 , @entity67 , she was told the body was no longer there			2
the death certificate drawn up by the @entity99 home says that @entity3 ’s remains were sent to the @entity106 funeral home in @entity14 on july 14			1
@entity107 , president and chief of operations of the company declined to confirm if the body was in @entity14 or if it was even in his custody			1
however he said that ' not uncommon ' for one funeral director to ' sub-contract ' services to another where they could not provide them , be it cremation or looking after the body in another country			2
he said that when bodies were being held in storage they are put in a freezer which he described as a ‘ special container ’ and said that the coroner in @entity14 had a large one it used in the morgue			2
asked if the @entity106 funeral home had such facilities , he said : ' of course '			1
mr @entity107 , who said he could only talk in general terms , said that sometimes people die in the winter and the family want a summer burial so they use the freezer and that legally there was ‘ no time limit ' as to how long it could stay there			2
bitter : @entity15 has been accused of ' playing games ' with @entity3 's elder children			1
she is in sole control of his body in death and moved it days before @entity39 won a restraining order to stop @entity3 's remains being cremated as to who was in charge of @entity3 ’s remains , however , he said that the @entity157 funeral home still had overall responsibility and pointed to its boss @entity157			1
mr @entity107 said : ' mr @entity157 is still in charge			0
he still has contact with the family			0
' i have no agreement with the family			0
i am not the funeral director involved			0
' in an interview with @entity8 mr @entity157 said he was ' baffled ' by the apparent contradiction			2
mr @entity157 had told the @entity169 that he was definitely not responsible for @entity3 any longer			0
in an interview he had said : ' what we did was made sure that @entity3 got to the airport , we released custody of @entity3 to the airline			0
' the airline signed for that and acknowledged that and then at that point we returned to our office , tracked his flight to @entity14 , confirmed that he had arrived , reported that to @entity181 ( @entity15 )			1
' when he landed in @entity14 , i ceased being the funeral director in charge			1
' mr @entity157 told @entity8 that those comments still stood			1
he said : ' my earlier statement ... is still true and accurate today			0
we have no family mandate			0
' why exactly @entity3 ’s body was taken to @entity14 is unclear			1
@entity3 had no known connection to the @entity57 city , his daughter @entity39 has said			0
a possible reason could be a bid by @entity15 to delay any further legal action by @entity39			2
by moving the body to another country , it throws up another legal barrier to @entity3 ’s family who want his body back			2
mr @entity107 said : ' when we are facing a difficult situation the best thing for us is to do nothing until the lawyers have found an agreement			0
we can not get in the middle of a family dispute			0
we are not there to judge			0
' he added that if @entity39 wanted the @entity96 judge ’s decision to apply in @entity14 she would have to make a separate legal application there too			2
@entity3 ’s death has led to bitter words from both sides			0
his brother @entity218 told @entity8 last week that @entity15 ’s decision to move the body to @entity14 was a ' sick joke by a sick woman '			1
at a complete loss over her father 's whereabouts , @entity39 does n't even know if her father may have already been buried in @entity227 in a secret funeral service			0
adding to the drama is that @entity230 in @entity231 , @entity232 , where @entity3 had been being cared for , still want to carry out an autopsy in their investigation into the alleged elder abuse			0
@entity231 police spokesman @entity236 said : ' mr @entity3 ’s matter is an open and on - going investigation			2
' as such the @entity231 @entity239 will not be issuing any statements and or disseminating any press releases pending further instructions from our @entity243			0

family spokesman told @entity8 they fear body is being stored in funeral home in @entity14
say widow @entity15 - who is at war with his children - is ' playing games ' and they could never find out where his burial is
@entity15 moved body to @entity14 on july 14 - a month after his death
was flown there just before daughter won restraining order from judge to stop @entity15 cremating body in the @entity267
