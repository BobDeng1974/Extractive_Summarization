by @entity0 for @entity1 a father battered senseless by a man who taunted his daughter has angrily condemned @entity6 ' joke justice ' after prosecutors let his attacker off with just a £ 400 fine			1
supermarket worker @entity10 , 42 , was beaten up and suffered multiple injuries to his face when he confronted a young man for insulting his 16 - year old daughter @entity14			1
father - of - three mr @entity10 suffered a fractured cheek , broken nose and had to have a metal plate inserted under his right eye socket with doctors warning he might be left partially sighted			1
if convicted , he could have faced five years in jail			0
but without mr @entity10 's knowledge @entity28 was offered a new charge ahead of the trial at @entity44 , @entity45			1
it was agreed he could admit a watered - down offence of ' using threatening , abusive or insulting words or behaviour ' towards the victim			1
mr @entity10 then got a letter from a @entity53 lawyer informing him of the result : ' the public order charge better reflects the evidence in the case			1
' @entity34 footage does not show who struck the first blow or how many blows were struck			0
i know that you may be disappointed with the decision - the courts have an even higher standard of proof than the test i have applied			0
' @entity34 footage of the street brawl involving @entity28 and @entity10			1
prosecutors said it was n't clear enough for a @entity24 prosecution to proceed @entity34 showed the two men facing each other before mr @entity10 was knocked to the ground and beaten the footage captured in @entity79 's car park then showed @entity28 and a friend running off the letter also claimed an ' independent witness ' gave a statement which supported @entity28 's account			1
but mr @entity10 , from @entity85 , in @entity86 , said : ' if this is @entity6 justice then it is a joke			1
the horrific injuries i suffered left me looking unrecognisable and doctors told me i was very close to losing sight in one of my eyes			2
' the police had @entity34 of the incident too which clearly shows him knocking me to the ground			0
what more evidence do you need ? @entity10 's injuries following the attack which left him with a fractured cheek , broken nose and had to have a metal plate inserted under his right eye socket mr 42 , was beaten up and suffered multiple injuries to his face when he confronted a young man who had earlier taunted his 16 - year old daughter @entity14 and left her in tears as she browsed around a market hall mr @entity10 said he saw @entity28 ( pictured ) after the conviction and ' he was laughing at me ' ' the doctors said if i had taken two more punches i would n't be here today			1
how can anyone conclude that what happened to me is insulting behaviour ? ' the incident occurred last november after @entity14 had gone to the @entity122 markets in @entity123 with friends			1
she bumped into @entity125 - a near - neighbour - and shortly afterwards she rang home in tears claiming he subjected her to a string of insults			0
mr @entity10 said : ' my daughter was really really upset			1
she said @entity28 had come up to her and said things like ' you are a slag ' , ' your mum is a fat bitch ' and all kinds of horrible things			2
' i just told her to get herself to the train station and come on home and we will pick her up			0
' @entity10 with his wife @entity143 , older daughter @entity14 and younger daughter @entity145 the @entity79 supermarket in @entity86 , @entity45 , where the brawl took place			1
mr @entity10 also worked there he later had an exchange of phone calls with @entity28 which led to a confrontation at a nearby @entity79 car park			1
@entity34 showed the two men facing each other before mr @entity10 was knocked to the ground and beaten			1
the footage then showed @entity28 and a friend running off			2
mr @entity10 , who still suffers from tingling numbness on the right side of his face and experiences double vision , said : ' i just remember he came for me and i went to block him in self defence			1
' then i remember him pummeling my face , punch after punch - it was unrelenting			2
the next thing i knew was waking up in hospital			0
' we were ready to claim justice for what had happened			2
not only was my daughter and wife traumatised after seeing me like that but i am still suffering			0
' we just could n't believe it when the letter arrived saying he got off			0
it came right out of the blue			0
surely in a justice system the victims should be consulted first if they are going to let someone off who has been charged			2
' i was told not to bother get my own solicitor because the @entity53 was there for us			2
yet the @entity53 never rang us to tell us they had accepted this change of plea			2
i wish i had got my own lawyer now			0
' it just seems the @entity53 just wanted a conviction and it does not matter what they get			2
it is just about ticking boxes			0
when i spoke to them they just said ' this is the decision we came to , we have a conviction and he has been charged '			0
' but he was n't charged for any assault whatsoever			0
i was just doing what any normal dad would do			0
i saw @entity28 after the conviction and he was laughing at me			2
' i asked him if it was funny that i was two punches away from death and he got a £ 400 fine			0
he just replied , ' i am laughing are n't i ? '' mr @entity10 's wife @entity143 , 41 , said : ' when i first went to hospital the injured man lying in his bed did n't look like my husband at all			1
he was beaten to a pulp and initially i thought he was dead			0
he was unconscious and there was blood absolutely everywhere			0
' she added : ' i remember there were police outside his hospital room and they said " do n't worry we are only here if things turn south "			0
' why would they say that if they did n't think it was serious			0
it seems you can go around beating up people and leaving them for dead and get fined £ 400			0
what lesson does that leave ? ' a @entity53 spokesman said : ' we have written to the victim to explain the reason behind the decision made in this case , and a senior crown prosecutor has also spoken with mr @entity10			1
we are more than happy to discuss the matter further with mr @entity10 if this would be of assistance			1
' the @entity53 also said a complaint procedure is available to mr @entity10 and he should contact his victim liaison officer if he wanted to pursue it			1
@entity28 was unavailable for comment .			2
