by @entity0 published : 14:55 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 14:55 est , 5 march 2013 a new study offers more compelling evidence that life expectancy for some @entity5 women is actually falling , a disturbing trend that experts ca n't explain			1
the latest research found that women age 75 and younger are dying at higher rates than previous years in nearly half of the nation 's counties - many of them rural and in the @entity15 and @entity16			2
curiously , for men , life expectancy has held steady or improved in nearly all counties			1
the study is the latest to spot this pattern , especially among disadvantaged white women			1
trend : a map of the @entity5 shows women 's deaths by age ; those in the @entity15 lived much shorter lives than those in other areas of the country weight of a nation : the latest research found that women age 75 and younger are dying at higher rates than previous years in nearly half of the nation 's counties ; the early deaths were linked to obesity and poverty some leading theories blame higher smoking rates , obesity and less education , but several experts said they simply do n't know why			1
women have long outlived men , and the latest numbers show the average life span for a baby girl born today is 81 , and for a baby boy , it 's 76			1
but the gap has been narrowing and data from the @entity54 has shown women 's longevity is not growing at the same pace as men 's			2
the phenomenon of some women losing ground appears to have begun in the late 1980s , though studies have begun to spotlight it only in the last few years			2
trying to figure out why is ' the hot topic right now , trying to understand what 's going on , ' said @entity66 , a @entity68 sociologist who has been focused on the life expectancy decline but had no role in the new study			1
researchers also do n't know exactly how many women are affected			2
@entity75 says a good estimate is roughly 12 percent			0
the study , released monday by the journal @entity79 , found declining life expectancy for women in about 43 percent of the nation 's counties			1
the researchers , @entity85 and @entity86 of the @entity87 , looked at federal death data and other information for nearly all 3,141 @entity5 counties over 10 years			0
they calculated mortality rates for women age 75 and younger , sometimes called ' premature death rates , ' because many of those deaths are considered preventable			1
many counties have such small populations that even slight changes in the number of deaths produce dramatic swings in the death rate from year to year			2
to try to stabilize the numbers , the researchers computed some five - year averages			0
they also used statistical tricks to account for factors like income and education			2
they found that nationwide , the rate of women dying younger than would be expected fell from 324 to 318 per 100,000			2
but in 1,344 counties , the average premature death rate rose , from 317 to about 333 per 100,000			0
deaths rates rose for men in only about 100 counties			0
' we were surprised ' by how much worse women did in those counties , and by the geographic variations , @entity85 said			0
up in smoke : the study also suggested that women who smoke or who have little education also died at an earlier age two years ago , a study led by the @entity130 's dr. @entity129 also looked at county - level death rates			1
it too found that women were dying sooner , especially in the @entity15			0
some other studies that focused on national data have highlighted steep declines in life expectancy for white women who never earned a high school diploma			1
meanwhile , life expectancy seems to be growing for more educated and affluent women			1
some experts also have suggested smokers or obese women are dragging down life expectancy			1
the @entity129 and @entity147 studies both spotlight regional differences			0
some of the highest smoking rates are in @entity15 states , and the proportion of women who failed to finish high school is also highest in the @entity15			1
' i think the most likely explanation for why mortality is getting worse is those factors are just stronger in those counties , ' @entity129 said , adding that abuse of @entity160 and other drugs also may add to the problem			0
some also think the statistics could reflect a migration of healthier women out of rural areas , leaving behind others who are too poor and unhealthy to relocate			0
that would change the rate , and make life expectancy in a county look worse , explained @entity172 of the @entity54 's @entity173			1
' we should n't jump to the conclusion that more people are getting sicker in these geographic areas than previously , ' he said			0
but that is open to debate			0
@entity180 did n't seem to affect male death rates			0
@entity129 disagrees with the theory , saying he has tracked a great deal of movement from urban areas to less - populated counties .			0

new study released by journal @entity79 says that while life expectancy is climbing for educated women , it is falling for those without education
also said deaths are preventable and are caused by obesity , smoking , and changeable habits
