by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:54 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 15:15 est , 15 november 2012 they say the devil is in the detail			0
but for @entity7 agent @entity6 the problem , over the past few days , has been the lack of it - publicly at least			1
special agent @entity10 has been revealed as the face , and torso , of the ' @entity14 ' whose images were found in socialite @entity16 's email account			1
amid the heat of that exposure the news of his own apparent indiscretion was treated as another layer of sexual intrigue in this tangled tale			0
in fact , @entity6 insists , it is nothing of the sort			0
the email was a joke that backfired more spectacularly than he could possibly have imagined and , perhaps , was allowed to			1
emails to a friend : socialite @entity16 arrives home in @entity44 on tuesday night the image in question was not some leering pose , directed at the object of his desire , but a round - robin joke - the sort of which the 47 - year - old special agent was in the habit of sending - that ended with a picture punchline			1
the snapshot showing @entity6 - bald , muscular and shirtless - posed between two buff , bullet - ridden target dummies and carrying the punchline , ' which one is @entity10 ? ' was framed and displayed on his wife 's desk at work			1
his supervisor even pinned it on the notice board in the @entity69			2
serious : @entity6 is pictured at a news conference in july 2005 at the @entity71 in @entity72 in fact as the @entity76 reports , one of the newspaper 's staff was among those to receive the email , sent in 2010 shortly after the special agent had been transferred from @entity80 to the @entity69 's @entity44 office			1
the email was sent on 9 september 2010			2
all of which points to the motivation of the sources that first leaked word of its existence being mischevious at best			0
because if not quite an @entity90 figure fallen to earth , @entity6 reputation has certainly been allowed to wilt in the heat of the media glare			0
july 27 , 2005 , @entity7 agent @entity94 according to the @entity95 has a reputation as a ' hard - charging ' field agent			1
it is a turn of phrase that implies an approach more likely to earn results than friends			0
@entity6 reportedly received a dressing down from his superiors when he impatiently tried to push forward the investigation into the emails received by @entity16			1
in the field : in this april 12 , 2007 , photo , @entity94 , right , works a scene in @entity44 , @entity109 it has been alleged that , frustrated by what he perceived as a lack of progress , @entity6 leaked details of the probe to the @entity116 in @entity117 , contacting representative @entity118 in october and asking for his help			1
mr @entity118 directed him to @entity121 majority leader , @entity120 who eventually passed the message onto the @entity7 director , @entity120 , completing a circle that looped well and truly above the heads of @entity6 direct superiors			2
one week later , on november 6th , @entity127 , @entity120 went to @entity128 the director of national intelligence and @entity134 's immediate superior - who urged him to resign as head of the @entity133			0
in fact , the @entity135 has written to @entity120 to ask why it took him a week to come foward with the information that @entity6 gave him			0
this photo taken wednesday , nov. 14 , 2012 shows the home owned by @entity7 agent @entity94 in @entity141 , @entity109 this is not the first time @entity6 has found himself on the receiving end of his boss 's opprobrium			1
' @entity10 is a passionate kind of guy , ' said one former colleague			0
' he 's kind of an obsessive type			0
if he locked his teeth onto something , he 'd be a bulldog			0
' @entity6 ' strong sense of right ' led him to push forward the investigation that exposed the affair between @entity159 , pictured above at her brother 's home in @entity163 , and gen @entity20 it did n't take long for that tenacity to show			1
for some who have worked with him it is part of what makes @entity6 ' one of the finest agents there is '			1
it is coupled with a strong sense of right - admirable traits but not always the most welcome combination to those concerned with the subtleties of state and politics			2
@entity6 studied @entity179 at the @entity180 and joined the @entity7 in 1996			2
within two years he was made the case agent in the @entity182 which foiled @entity184 's 1999 plan to attack @entity185			2
the trial judge in that case repeatedly praised @entity6 for his integrity and efforts			0
but the agent still managed to fall foul of his bosses for his outspoken opposition to the decision to turn @entity184 over to @entity196 agents			1
he felt that the tactic would unravel what trust had been established and lead to @entity184 's co-operation drying up			0
having served in @entity200 might have felt himself on safer ground , transferred to the @entity203 , but the opposite has proven true twice over			0
@entity44 society was far more dangerous territory than @entity6 could have known			0
@entity207 , gen. @entity20 ; @entity209 and @entity16 and @entity210 watch the @entity212 parade in @entity44 , @entity109 in 2010 in may 2010 he was attacked by a knife - wielding man , outside @entity214 , @entity44			1
@entity6 , who was training with @entity215 and special - forces soldiers at the base , shot and killed the man			2
in an email to the @entity76 he described the incident , ' i had four seconds that seemed like 40 , to go through my mental checks			2
' conscious of bystanders and cars , he waited , ' till he was five feet from me before firing two rounds			0
. after repeatedly warning him			0
' i did n't have time to put on my ballistic vest			2
' embroiled : general @entity230 - seen here with wife @entity232 and daughter @entity233 behind him - is now caught up in the scandal after being linked with @entity16 crazy world indeed			1
the scandal that has spun from the investigaion first started by @entity6 now involves general @entity230 who has also found himself accused of ' inappropriate ' email correspondence with @entity16			1
meanwhile two years after fending off that knife - weilding assailant @entity237 once again finds himself the target of an attack of sorts			0
@entity242 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) are both caught up to their necks in the burgeoning sex scandal popular : @entity16 is pictured left in her yearbook photo and with her husband dr. @entity247 , right on moving to @entity44 , @entity6 and his wife became friends of @entity16 and her husband , cancer specialist , @entity209 , socially			1
they dipped into the party circuit and mingling with the @entity254 in @entity44 and the @entity109			2
two years later @entity16 did what @entity16 seems to specialise in doing			1
she called in a favour			0
she told @entity6 about the emails she was receiving , and @entity6 - hard - charging field agent that he is - responded			1
he could never have imagined that in doing so he would uncover a scandal of such magnitude or that he would become a minor casualty of it all - stripped of his shirt and some portion of his credibility			0
video : calls for an investigation into the timeline of the @entity20 affair			1

@entity273 , 47 , is the @entity7 agent who initiated the investigation that brought down @entity276 boss @entity20
he was revealed as the ' shirtless special agent ' accused of becoming ' obsessed ' with @entity109 socialite @entity16
one of the ' finest agents in the field ' the emails were a joke , he says , sent two years *ago* from a joint email account *shared* by his wife
he pushed the @entity292 investigation into the spotlight with a ' sense of right ' that has put him on the wrong side of @entity69 bosses before
