@entity1 's latest editorial lays out the rules of etiquette surrounding a threesome @entity1 has long been the go - to read for anyone interested in learning how the other half lives - or seeing fellow aristo chums in the party pages			1
but now the upper class bible and subject of a @entity12 documentary , has shared its etiquette tips for a rather racy social situation - how to behave in a threesome			1
the rules laid out include guidelines on personal hygiene and how to pick the third member , if you 're a couple			1
the article notes : ' in sex , as in life , generosity and manners are important - particularly in a threesome			1
' it 's like talking to people on either side of you at a dinner party ; you must share your attention equally and not allow anyone to feel left out			0
' the magazine recommends upping the normal standards of personal grooming ( because ' the stakes have been doubled ' )			2
it also wisely suggests ensuring you are @entity39 - free before sharing a bed with two people			2
besides these basic courtesies , the magazine explains how to have a terribly polite and correct ménage à trois without offending well - to - do friends or rocking your social circle			1
according to @entity1 , if you decide to get frisky at somebody else 's house it is rude not to at least extend the offer of a threesome to the host first			0
and whatever the venue , you can only change your mind about your participation before clothing has been removed			0
to leave once people are naked is classed as ' poor form '			1
once the deed is done , it is apparently acceptable to leave swiftly , without the normal obligatory emotional moments , post-coital embracing or morning - after breakfast			2
if , and when , you run into someone with whom you 've shared a threesome , @entity1 offers very clear rules on behaviour			2
leaving no room for error it explains : ' when you next bump into the participants - at a party , for example - look them in the eye , kiss them on both cheeks ( face cheeks , mind ) and act insouciant			1
' it is correct behaviour to invite the host if you engage in a threesome at a party or another person 's house the eyebrow - raising article is a far cry from @entity1 's usual fare , covering the latest faces at debutante balls and explaining how to behave when invited to a friend 's @entity94 villa , a piece which appeared in this month 's edition of the glossy magazine			1
from society to sex , glossy magazine @entity1 is the @entity102 for correct etiquette in every situation although @entity1 's readership is small , it represents one of the richest ( and poshest ) of any publication in the @entity109			1
however , while threesomes might be becoming popular among the rich and titled , not everyone is a fan			0
@entity112 , former editor of @entity113 and sex columnist , says : ' i tend to think that there 's a sort of sexism at play			0
' most men are very keen on two women and a bloke , but not at all interested in two blokes and a woman ( unless they happen to be a premier league footballer , that is )			0
' and then there 's also the truth - in my observation of friends who 've dabbled in them - that someone gets left out			2
' i 've seen couples invite another person in , only for one party in that couple to get carried away about the new individual , sometimes carrying on an affair behind their partner 's back			0
' three is always a slightly unsatisfactory , someone 's - left - out number			0
just as three friends at school are always forming new dynamics and leaving someone out			0
' @entity1 was recently the star of a @entity147 documentary , @entity148 : inside @entity1 which followed the workings of the historic magazine as editors and writers attempted to capture the upper class zeitgeist			1
