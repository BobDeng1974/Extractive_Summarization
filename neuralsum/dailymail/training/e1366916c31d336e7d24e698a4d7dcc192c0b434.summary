by @entity0 published : 08:49 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 13:14 est , 24 january 2013 thousands of dead starfish have washed up on a beach in @entity3 after a period of stormy weather			1
shocked photographer @entity6 estimates that 4,000 starfish - along with whelks ' eggs and pieces of shell - had surfaced on @entity12 beach			1
experts think that the animals were dislodged by rough waters in the recent wintry weather , with a similar incident happening at the same time last year			1
puzzle : photographer @entity6 was shocked to find around 4,000 starfish and bits of shell on the beach wetlands : @entity27 ' eggs also appeared at @entity12 beach			1
in the past , sea potatoes have washed up poignant : it 's thought that rough seas dislodged the sea creatures at a sandy part of the coastline @entity35 starfish strandings , known as ‘ wrecks ’ , are not uncommon in @entity37 and typically occur once or twice a year as a result of storms			1
most starfish travel alone or in small groups , but congregate in their millions if a particular area of the seabed is rich in food or to reproduce			2
despite its name , the starfish is not a fish but an echinoderm and holds on to the ocean floor using their suction - cupped tube feet underneath their limbs			2
wreck : @entity35 stranding in @entity53 in 2010 they are therefore vulnerable during bad weather at sea as storms send strong currents through the beds where they are feeding , plucking them off their prey			2
the currents then carry them to the shore , and dump them on the beach			0
although tides and strong currents are the most likely cause of this recent mass stranding , in a similar incident in @entity71 last year , starvation was to blame			0
when hundreds of starfish stranded in southern @entity71 scientists said lack of food had made them too weak to hold on to the ocean floor			0
due to environmental hazards and overfishing of mussels , starfish are moving closer to the shore , becoming more vulnerable to tide and currents			0
@entity84 , communications manager at the @entity85 , said : ' these are all common starfish @entity87 rubens			0
' the fact that there 's what appear to be whelk eggs and different shells in these pictures , both shallow water residents , along with the common starfish , would back up the likelihood that it is simply stormy weather that has caused this big strand			1
' we were aware of a strand like this in the region at this time last year , too			0
' @entity104 of starfish and sea potatoes , a kind of sand - dwelling sea urchin , happen quite regularly in different parts of the coast			0
' they seem to occur most in winter , and around sandy areas , when it 's likely that rough seas in shallow water dislodge them in large numbers			1
' strandings like this may be associated with breeding , indicated if all of the specimens that washed up are mature adults , but the common starfish tends to aggregate and spawn most in spring and summer - so that is unlikely			1
' millions of common starfish live in @entity127 seas			1
about the size of a hand , they are pinky orange when alive , but turn a bright orange when dry			0
their ideal feeding ground is a mussel bed , where millions of starfish will congregate at any one time			0
and it 's here where they are most at risk			2
violent storms can send terrifically strong currents through the mussel beds where they are feeding , pluck them off their prey , carry them to the shore and dump thousands at a time on to a beach			0
in the past , some mass strandings have been blamed on overfishing - with dredgers used to scrape the sea floor for mussels dislodging starfish or covering them with mud and sand			2
coastal confusion : similar ' mass strandings ' have happened in the past - mostly in winter , around sandy areas strange : a similar stranding was seen last year			1
sometimes they happen in @entity166 during breeding season			0

@entity27 eggs and shells were also washed ashore at @entity12
*conservationists* said ' strandings ' have happened before
it 's thought rough seas in shallow water may have dislodged them
