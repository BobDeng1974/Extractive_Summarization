by @entity0 published : 04:14 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 19:37 est , 9 december 2013 a computer system handling the government ’s flagship @entity4 scheme can not cope with the ‘ complicated ’ lives led by millions of families , ministers admitted yesterday			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) will today announce £ 40million of new it equipment has already been written off			0
a further £ 91million of bespoke software will become defunct when the system is operational in 2017 , although the department insisted this was ‘ not a write - off ’			2
pressure : work and pensions secretary @entity15 was grilled by mps about the costs and timings of his flagship welfare reform the computer system is so limited that benefits claims involving couples or families have to be dealt with manually , mps were told yesterday			1
work and pensions secretary @entity15 angrily denied the scheme was in chaos , telling the commons work and pensions committee : ‘ there is no debacle on @entity4			1
’ but trouble - shooter @entity29 , who was brought in this year to rescue the £ 2.4billion scheme , said it still faced major challenges in dealing with all but the most straightforward benefit claims			1
he said the automated system could not currently deal with claims involving couples or children			0
a tiny pilot scheme involving just 2,000 people had focused almost exclusively on young single men , whose claims are straightforward			2
officials have to make manual checks if a claimant moves in with a partner or has a child			0
the @entity8 said last night the it problems had to be set against the estimated £ 38billion of economic benefits that @entity4 could eventually bring			1
there is growing unease in government that the most ambitious change to the welfare system for 60 years is falling behind schedule			0
grilling : mr @entity15 ( second left ) was flanked by key advisers , including ( l - r ) @entity4 director general @entity56 , welfare reform minister @entity57 and @entity8 finance director @entity58 the government has abandoned the idea of all services being ' digital by default '			1
@entity63 ordered all departments to make the internet the first port of call for all services			0
but the man in charge of the huge @entity4 welfare reform admitted that the benefits would not be ' digital first '			1
@entity29 ( pictured ) was challenged by mps about the dramatic shift in policy			2
the director general of @entity4 said : ' digital by default as far as i am concerned went away a long time ago			1
that 's my understanding very clearly			0
' he went on : ' it is working			0
there is this constant suggestion it is not working			0
' @entity88 has seized on figures which show that only a tiny fraction of the numbers due to be using the new system by the time of the 2015 general election would be transferred on time			1
only a ‘ handful ’ of the promised 1.7 million would be switched by 2014 - 15 and only 400,000 by the following year - less than 10 per cent of the original target , the @entity96 said			2
as recently as october mr @entity15 insisted his it was still on track			2
but he has conceded that as many as 700,000 claimants will now face a longer wait before being transferred to the new system			2
earlier he refused to comment on @entity88 ’s figures , but admitted : ‘ i do accept , of course , that this plan is different from the original plan			1
’ some 700,000 disabled people will not be transferred by the deadline because of the complexity of their claims			1
millions of other benefit claimants who were due to be transferred to the new system in the next 18 months will now not do so until well after the election			2
the delay is embarrassing for mr @entity15 , who has staked his reputation on the delivery of the scheme , which is designed to ensure it always pays people to work			0
@entity4 will combine @entity119 , income - related @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and housing benefit			1
speaking ahead of his appearance before the @entity126 , mr @entity15 said the delay was to allow the most vulnerable claimants more time to adjust to the change			2
‘ we could easily have tried to rush those people in but we have decided not to , ’ he told @entity131 's today programme			0
‘ they are the people who do n't have any work requirement on them and they have had the biggest change going through the work capability assessment and therefore they need time to get through			0
i think it is only fair to give them longer			0
’ ministers claim the initial roll - out of @entity4 - which combines six means - tested benefits into one monthly payment designed to ensure people are better - off working than on benefits - has been a success			1
they point to figures suggesting it is encouraging more people to look for jobs in what mr @entity15 described as a ‘ cultural shift ’			0
shake - up : @entity4 will combine @entity119 , income - related @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and housing benefit but critics say the limited implementation of the scheme - which has been plagued by @entity156 and other problems - only involve the least challenging cases			1
and it was branded ‘ inadequate ’ and open to fraud in a scathing report by a cross-party committee			0
the @entity163 found that at least £ 140 million had already been wasted on the project , which was blighted by ‘ alarmingly weak ’ management			0
@entity88 's shadow work and pensions @entity166 said the reforms were now in chaos in october , mr @entity15 told the @entity126 : ' @entity4 credit will roll out very well and it will be on time and within budget			1
' today @entity166 , @entity88 ’s shadow work and pensions secretary , said the scheme was in chaos and urged mr @entity15 to hold cross-party talks to rescue it			1
‘ @entity63 and @entity15 repeatedly promised to deliver their flagship policy “ on time and within budget ”			2
‘ that claim , and the credibility they staked on it , now lie in tatters			0
‘ for months on end , the government have tried to avoid answering questions about @entity4 but these @entity192 figures tell the truth of how ( they ) have broken their promises on a spectacular scale			1
‘ they have been forced to admit that they have completely missed their targets and @entity4 will not now be rolled out before the election			2
‘ @entity63 and @entity15 are presiding over a complete mess and it is taxpayers who are picking up the bill with at least £ 100 million of their money written off			0
" giving evidence alongside mr @entity15 at the @entity207 will be @entity29 , the former @entity208 executive drafted in earlier this year to ‘ reset ’ the programme amid growing concerns over delays and it issues			1
he may also be questioned about reports - which he denies - that he sought to have @entity215 pin blame for the failures on @entity8 ( @entity8 ) chief civil servant @entity217			0
in written evidence to the committee , the @entity8 said it was ‘ confident that it has taken , and continues to take , the right remedial steps to address past issues in the @entity4 programme ’ .			0

@entity4 due to combine a raft of benefits into one by 2017
but ministers now admit 700,000 will not be transferred in time
@entity15 concedes : ' this plan is different from the original plan '
trouble - shooter @entity29 said it still faced major challenges in dealing with all but the most straightforward benefit claims
@entity88 says plan is in chaos , promises on being on time have been broken
