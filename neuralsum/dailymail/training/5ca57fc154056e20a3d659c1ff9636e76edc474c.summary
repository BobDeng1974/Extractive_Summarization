he was only found the next afternoon following a work 's @entity14 drinks around @entity16 , @entity17			1
after he died his girlfriend later discovered she was pregnant with his child			1
the surveyor at construction firm @entity21 had been booked to stay elsewhere , but returned to the @entity24 hotel with two colleagues and they fell asleep in the second - floor hotel room			1
tragedy : @entity8 , pictured with his girlfriend @entity28 , died from hypothermia on christmas day 2013 in love : mr @entity8 and his girlfriend @entity28 , pictured in november 2013 however the next morning colleagues @entity32 and @entity34 woke to find mr @entity8 not there , although his coat and shoes were still there and the window was open			1
thinking nothing of it they went for breakfast and took his belongings with them back to the office			2
both men claimed to have drunk so much they could not remember anything about their return to the hotel or the evening 's events			2
it was not until lunchtime later that day that the firm 's secretary was told to ring around local hospitals to track down their missing employee , @entity52 heard			2
his father , @entity58 , fought back tears as he criticised the men for not raising the alarm when they awoke to find the window open and mr @entity8 ' belongings still in the room			1
he said : ' did n't alarm bells ring when you got up @entity8 's coat and shoes were there , thinking where in the hotel is he ? ' you did n't raise the alarm and search for him			1
that 's the thing we ca n't come to terms with			0
' you remember what you did in the morning			0
you went to breakfast while he was lying above you and i hope you feel very bad about it			0
' inquest : @entity52 heard how mr @entity8 ( pictured with his nephew ) was prone to sleepwalking , especially after he 'd had a lot to drink the firm eventually contacted mr @entity8 ' partner , @entity87 , who called @entity17 police to report him missing around 1pm , who rated him as ' low risk '			1
mr @entity8 said to the court : ' i have learned one thing today - if you are " low risk " do n't bother calling the police			1
' ms @entity87 appeared alongside her dead boyfriend 's father where she was equally critical of the firm 's decision not to contact them first to see if he had gone home to sleep off his hangover			2
she said : ' if i had known that he had n't turned up for work the next morning , i would have been worried because it was highly unlike him			0
' coroner @entity106 said that a different course of action by colleagues the morning afterwards could have saved him			0
he said : ' what concerns me is at what stage do you get worried that he had not turned up for work			0
' what we do n't know is if calling him at 10 would have meant he survived			0
' agony : father - to - be mr @entity8 was found ' groaning ' on the flat roof of the four - star @entity121 in @entity123 sporty : mr @entity8 loved keeping active and is pictured here on a snowboarding holiday the inquest heard it was not until the following afternoon that a workman in a first - floor room raised the alarm after spotting him lying unconscious			1
at the hospital doctors attempted to warm him back up while bypassing his heart in an effort to avoid any cardiac arrests as he stabilised but he had been cold for so long that his internal organs , including his brain , had been irreversibly damaged			0
a blood sample taken on his arrival at hospital showed a blood alcohol level of around 110mg , well over the 80mg drink drive limit			0
but pathologist dr @entity142 calculated that with the reading taken at 5pm the day after the works do , his peak level could have been around 300mg			0
mr @entity106 said : ' dr @entity142 tells me that the cause of death , that i accepted , is complications arising from severe hypothermia			1
' it was december , it was getting light at around 7.30 in the morning , this fall would have occurred well before that so that even if they were called at 10 or 11 he would have been out for a significant time in the cold			0
' but we do n't know because it was 2pm until he was found by the ambulance workers who found him profoundly hypothermic at 14.35			2
' i have people die from 300mg , it causes coronary and respiratory failure , people have choked on their own vomit lying in bed			0
' earlier in the inquest mr @entity8 ' family said he had a history of sleep walking			1
however the coroner added : ' people were quite excited about the sleep walking situation , but there is no evidence that			0
' that 's all speculation , there is no @entity181 evidence , there is no forensic evidence , there is only the evidence of where he was found			2
' he said the failure for his drunk colleagues to remember anything about the night made it ' extremely difficult '			0
recording death by misadventure he told the family : ' if concerns were escalated earlier it may have been a different story , but we do n't know			2
' i suspect this will always be with you and i just feel so sad for you , so sad			0
' outside court mr @entity8 ' family and relatives declined to comment			1
