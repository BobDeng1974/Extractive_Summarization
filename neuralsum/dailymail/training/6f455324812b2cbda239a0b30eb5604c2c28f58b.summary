by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 13:02 est , 15 january 2013 a former @entity1 who spent four months wrongly imprisoned in @entity3 has described the horrifying conditions of life in one of the country 's most infamous jails			1
@entity9 , 27 , spent most of his time at @entity12 state prison in @entity13 chained to his bed in solitary confinement after he was arrested for declaring a legally - owned hunting shotgun to @entity3 border guards			1
he endured regular threats on his life from officers and inmates alike , suffered extortion attempts on his family and developed a string of serious health complaints that went untreated until his release before @entity27			1
scary : @entity9 endured regular threats on his life from guards and inmates alike , suffered extortion attempts on his family and developed a string of serious health complaints that went untreated until his release before @entity27 hungry and alone : @entity9 spent most of his time at @entity12 state prison in @entity13 chained to his bed as in solitary confinement ' i was dehydrated , malnourished , i had a lung infection , stomach issues and a number of other things , ' he told @entity41 ' @entity40			1
' it think it was because of a bad environment			0
' extraordinarily , prison guards even tried to extort money from his family in return for his safe release			2
' initially there was some pressure put on me , ' he added			0
' there were threats on my life ... and they tried to extort money from my family			0
trapped : @entity1 @entity58 's ordeal began in august when he and a friend drove across the @entity3 border on their way to @entity63 on a summer surfing trip ' they call your family , they throw threats at you and your family and tell you that " we need your money "			1
' there were times when i was afraid for my life			0
' @entity9 's ordeal began in august when he and a friend drove across the @entity3 border on their way to @entity63 on a summer surfing trip			1
the trip was meant to be a time for relaxation and catharsis following his honourable discharge from the @entity1 after being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by seeing a friend shot dead by a sniper in @entity87 in 2007			1
they wanted to take his grandmother 's legally registered hunting shotgun on the trip and asked @entity93 authorities what they had to do to to take it across the border			2
' we told them we ’ve got this hunting shotgun , " we ’re trying to go through @entity3 legally , what do we have to do ? " ' they gave us paperwork to fill out and said as long as you declare it you should be fine			2
we paid a fee , crossed the border and declared the weapon			0
then things started going wrong			0
' but when @entity9 and his friend crossed the border and handed the paperwork to @entity3 officials , they impounded the rv and jailed the two men , saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun - which they deemed to be an inch too short			1
@entity3 law prohibits civilians from carrying certain types of guns , like sawed - off shotguns - which can be more easily concealed - as well as shotguns with a barrel of less than 25 inches			2
his lawyer , @entity127 said @entity3 officials measured the barrel on @entity9 's shotgun as 24 inches and that it has not been sawed off			1
weapon in question : @entity9 had his great - grandfather 's antique rifle inspected at the border , but he was arrested for carrying it anyway hero : @entity9 was a combat veteran who had been treated for ptsd just before his arrest in @entity3 nevertheless , he was taken to prison and held indefinitely			1
so he whiled away the time by reading the two books he had with him - @entity142 of @entity143 , a true story about @entity1 in combat on the @entity146 in 1950 , and @entity147			2
he read both , all the way through			0
he was finally released just before @entity27 and has been recovering ever since			0
but incredibly , he says he bears no ill will towards @entity3			0
' i think @entity3 's a great place , ' he said			0
' i really wish everywhere could get its act together			0
' @entity9 served in @entity87 and @entity154 before being honorably discharged from the @entity1 in 2007			1
his mother said surfing helped him cope after he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder			2
@entity9 developed ptsd following the death of a fellow @entity1 who was killed by a sniper 's bullet when the two served together in @entity163 , @entity87			1
he had just completed treatment at a center for veterans in @entity167 last year , before getting detained during his misadventure in @entity12 .			0
