by @entity1 reporter published : 15:55 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 16:41 est , 29 august 2013 an elderly couple who have been married for 66 years have both undergone the same life - saving surgery after learning they suffered from exactly the same heart defect			1
@entity7 , 90 , and her husband @entity6 , 92 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , both learned they were suffering from critical aortic stenosis after they struggled to catch their breath			1
but after undergoing the same straight - forward operation , they are on the mend and are looking forward to celebrating their 67th wedding anniversary in november			1
at a press conference on wednesday , doctors explained their condition meant their aortic valves failed to open and close properly , which increased pressure on their hearts and caused chest pains			2
sharing everything : @entity7 , 90 , and husband @entity6 , 92 , discovered they had the same heart defect due to their ages , the couple were not deemed suitable candidates for open heart surgery and underwent a much less invasive procedure , a transcatheter aortic valve replacement , @entity28 reported			1
the procedure involves using a catheter to guides a replacement valve through the bloodstream to the heart , where it is expanded to enlarge the size of the opening of the old valve			1
@entity6 underwent the operation at @entity45 in june , and a month later , his wife checked in for the same procedure			1
they both remained at the hospital for a couple of weeks			2
' i feel great , ' @entity51 said			0
' ( it ) gave me new life			0
' before the operation , ' when i bent over , could n't come up , have a sigh and i just breathe heavy ' , he explained			0
his wife added : ' we 're doing ok			0
so far , so good			0

an old photograph shows them grinning on their wedding day - the same happy smiles they shared during a press conference at the hospital			0
dr. @entity78 explained that the condition usually affects people over 70 and symptoms include chest pain , shortness of breath and fatigue			0
while more than 50 per cent of people in this age group do not live a year after developing the symptoms , he said the less invasive procedure was helping many , @entity28 7 reported			2
' many of these elderly patients would have been too sick to have open heart surgery , ' he said			2
' the transcatheter approach gives them the ability to have valve replace without having a major operation			0
' procedure : they underwent the operations at @entity45 and are on the mend see below for video			1

@entity7 , 90 , and her husband @entity6 , 92 , both underwent a new heart procedure within weeks of each other after suffering breathing *problems*
