success treatment : the ' @entity1 ' has had twice the success rates as the conventional method a half - price version of @entity1 that women could have in their lunch - hour has been shown to raise the chances of having a baby drastically			1
it is particularly effective for those in their late 30s and early 40s and success rates are almost twice as high as the conventional fertility treatment			1
the technique involves using far lower doses of drugs , with the result that it is not only far cheaper , but also has virtually no side effects			1
many women undergoing normal @entity1 suffer from mood swings , nausea and headaches			1
in rare cases it can cause a life - threatening condition whereby their abdomen fills with fluid			0
this new method , known as @entity30 , involves giving women a daily pill for ten to 12 days which contains a low dose of the fertility drug clomid			0
this encourages their ovaries to produce eggs and during this time the women undergo ultrasound scans every few days to check the eggs are developing healthily			0
once the eggs are large enough – around another ten days later – they are removed during a five - minute operation			0
this means women can have it done before work , or during their lunch break , unlike normal ivf which lasts half a day and requires them to be put to sleep			1
doctors from @entity53 , @entity54 , who developed the method say it should be routinely offered to all women as it is cheaper , safer and a far more effective alternative			0
trials involving 520 women unveiled at the @entity64 conference in @entity65 showed that success rates for women over 35 were a third higher compared with those undergoing conventional @entity1			1
the results were even better among the over- 40s – those using this new method were twice as likely to have a baby compared to if they had used the conventional fertility treatment			2
dr @entity76 , a fertility expert who helped develop the method , said it was so effective it offered women in their 40s the same chance of falling pregnant as those in their twenties			0
too good to be true ? the new @entity1 treatment is particularly effective for those in their late 30s and early 40s , using far lower doses of drugs , and also has virtually no side effects in women aged 35 or below , success rates are about the same as standard ivf but the researchers say they would also benefit from using it because it is far cheaper and has fewer side effects			1
dr @entity76 said : ‘ this is perfect for @entity101 and it would save an incredible amount of money			0
this is the magic solution			0
’ a course of @entity108 costs between £ 1,200 and £ 1,800 compared with standard ivf which is between £ 3,000 and £ 4,000			0
the reason it is so much cheaper is that it involves using far lower doses of the fertility drug clomid			1
but this also makes it safer as large amounts of medication can lead to the deadly condition ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome whereby their abdomens fill with fluid – this occurs in 1 per cent of women having @entity1			2
one of main reasons women in their late 30s and early 40s have problems conceiving either naturally or with @entity1 is that they do not produce enough healthy eggs , capable of developing into an embryo and eventually a foetus			2
in fact , the high dose fertility drugs used in conventional @entity1 worsen this problem as although they make a woman produce more eggs , they also appear to result in changes in the dna of the eggs which make them defective			1
but @entity30 only uses very low doses of the drugs that do not make the woman ’s eggs less healthy			2
professor @entity141 , a consultant gynaecologist at the @entity143 fertility clinic create said : ‘ this study is a valuable addition to the growing evidence that mild stimulation @entity1 needs to become the first choice in @entity1 clinics for many women			0

new @entity1 treatment particularly effective for those aged 35 - *45*
technique uses lower doses of drugs , yet is twice as effective
@entity159 lasts only five minutes compared to *traditional* half - day
