@entity0 gritted his teeth , wiped his brow and looked to the sky after winning on grass for the first time in two years			1
he had become only the 11th player in the open era to win 700 tour - level matches but his expression told a story of relief , not records , after he battled back to beat @entity13 4 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3			1
the murmurs began among the @entity16 crowd as the @entity17 , unknown to all but the tennis fanatics in attendance , served out to take the first set over the world no 1			1
after being bundled out in the first round at @entity23 last year by tour journeyman @entity24 , was @entity0 about to take another early bow ? tough test : @entity0 recovered from a slow start to make it through to the second round the @entity30 shuffled to his seat , peeled off his top — much to the delight of some spectators — and could have been forgiven for posing himself that very question			1
but doubts like that are for mere mortals , not for great warriors like @entity0 , who denied his thoughts had wandered to @entity24 or @entity41 , the @entity42 who knocked him out in 2012			1
‘ when you are in a match , you are not thinking about what happened last year or two years ago , ’ he said , ‘ you ’re thinking about the next point , you ’re thinking about finding a solution for that match			0
’ in a curious twist , @entity0 will face @entity52 in the next round , the same stage at which the @entity42 triumphed in a five - set blockbuster			1
but @entity0 is not one to entertain talk of bogeymen			1
‘ i lost because he ’s a good player , ’ he said			0
‘ he plays very well on this surface and it will be a tough match again			0
i know if i want to have chances to win , i need to play very well			2
’ @entity13 might be 51 in the world — 50 places behind @entity0 — but he is no slouch , as evidenced by his @entity68 award in 2012 and the way he attacked from the first point			1
the 24 - year - old immediately raced to three break points , which @entity0 saved			1
but the @entity30 was broken in the ninth game of the set and looked jaded , perhaps feeling the effects of the run to his 15th @entity78 title at @entity79 earlier this month			2
pure delight : @entity0 celebrates his win as he looks to win another @entity23 title effort : @entity0 needed to draw on his reserves to book his place in the next round @entity23 day 2 review in @entity88 last week he lost to world no 78 @entity90 and admitted he is struggling to make the transition from clay to grass with only two weeks between the conclusion of the @entity79 and the start of @entity23			1
‘ mentally and physically you play a long clay - court season , ’ he said			2
‘ if you are able to win @entity79 , you have already played for a long time at your top level — mentally and physically			2
it is normal to go down a little bit			0
the grass deserves to have one more week , as it will next year			0
for the players who are able to play very well and long on clay , having this extra week will help			0
‘ it is always a bit more dangerous physically when you are finishing @entity79 on sunday and you have to play again on wednesday			0
‘ it ’s tough to make the right preparation for the tournament			0
you do n’t have a lot of time to prepare and to play matches on grass but the best players are able to do it			0
’ @entity0 looked the least comfortable of the top four in the opening round but once he has battled through the early stages and found his feet on the greens of @entity120 , you sense a third @entity23 title could be on the cards			1
he would become only the second man after @entity124 to win at @entity79 and @entity23 in the same year on three occasions			2
pumped up : @entity0 was his usual expressive self on court this was a workmanlike and confidence - boosting victory for @entity0 after more than three hours on court but there were some magic moments			1
in the fourth set he slipped , got up and smacked a backhand diagonally which dipped inside the line to set up a break point , which he duly converted for the double break			2
@entity13 fought valiantly , got one break back and forced @entity0 to save a break point as he served out for the match			1
first round victories for world no 1s are rarely celebrated so expansively			0
@entity144 completed his 13th first - round victory at @entity23 with a 6 - 2 , 6 - 7 ( 14 - 16 ) , 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 win over world no 120 @entity148			1
now aged 33 , this could be his final competitive visit here and he will face against 15th seed and 2013 semi-finalist @entity152 tomorrow			0
close : @entity13 could n't keep up his effort and lost in four sets the @entity155 made it clear after his victory how much he enjoys @entity23 , saying : ‘ it does n’t get any better than playing in this tournament , physically i ’ve come through a few things over the last couple of years with surgeries ... but it ’s all worth it out here			2
’ only three times in his 16 visits has @entity144 fallen at the first hurdle , and in 2002 he won the title , beating the now - retired @entity166			0
there are only four other former champions in the men ’s draw , and the one in @entity144 ’s quarter is seven - time winner @entity173			0
‘ i came out being really aggressive and played a great first set , and then it ’s always tough because you ’ve got to start again			0
‘ fitness-wise i felt fine			0

@entity0 beat @entity13 after losing the first set
the @entity180 1 recovered from @entity13 *'s* bold opening *display* to win 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 3 6 - 3 on @entity16
