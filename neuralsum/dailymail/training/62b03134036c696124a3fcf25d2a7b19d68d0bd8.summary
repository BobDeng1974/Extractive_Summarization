by @entity0 political editor , @entity1 billionaire former @entity3 chairman @entity2 has released a series of polls carried out in key swing constituencies @entity7 is tightening its grip on key election battlegrounds across the country as @entity3 voters desert to @entity12 , according to a major new poll			1
the survey of eight @entity3 - held marginal constituencies shows that each one would fall to @entity7 if an election were held tomorrow			1
and polling in four @entity7 - held marginal seats suggests only one would be a close contest , with @entity7 comfortably holding the other three			1
the study , conducted by former @entity3 treasurer @entity2 , suggests @entity22 still has a mountain to climb in order to stay in @entity25 next year			1
and it suggests that @entity28 ’s prospects are being boosted by the reluctance of @entity3 defectors to @entity12 to desert @entity31			2
just under seven out of 10 people who voted @entity33 in 2010 said they would do so again next year			0
of the remainder some 17 per cent said they would now vote @entity12			0
the findings will increase pressure on mr @entity22 to adopt a tougher line on both @entity39 and immigration in the run - up to the election in a bid to persuade defectors to return to the @entity3 fold			2
mr @entity28 receives a further boost from the collapse of the @entity49 vote			0
barely a quarter of those who voted @entity49 last time say they will do so again			0
of those who did not almost a third say they will now vote @entity7			0
lord @entity2 said the findings ‘ confirm my view that it ’s going to be close , but the @entity3 have most to do ’			1
lord @entity2 ’s research has previously looked at the 12 most marginal conservative - held seats , where he has found a strong swing to @entity7			1
this time , polling focused on the ‘ second tier ’ of marginal seats , where @entity7 needs a bigger swing to win			1
voters were polled in @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			0
in all eight seats @entity7 would now win , thanks to an average swing from the @entity3 of 6.5 per cent			1
@entity12 achieved double - digit support in each of the seats , and attracted support of more than 20 per cent in @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity82			0
the @entity49 , by comparison , failed to reach 10 per cent in any of the seats			0
the polling also revealed that @entity7 would hold on to three key marginal seats – @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 and @entity90			1
only in @entity91 would the @entity3 run them close			0
the polling appears to confirm the @entity3 ’ key message that @entity3 supporters who back @entity12 risk putting mr @entity28 into power by the back door			0
@entity3 high command plans to hammer home the message ‘ @entity102 , get @entity28 ’ next year			0
but more than two - fifths of @entity3 defectors ( 41 per cent ) polled in the latest survey ruled out going back to the conservatives under any circumstances			2
@entity22 has a mountain to climb to win the next election , according to a survey of marginal constituencies but despite the apparently gloomy message for mr @entity22 , the new survey contains some cheer for @entity3 supporters			2
despite the average 10 - point @entity7 lead in the marginal seats polled , the majority of voters in these constituencies are either satisfied with mr @entity22 ’ s performance ( 29 per cent ) or prefer him to mr @entity28 ( 29 per cent )			1
just 31 per cent of voters in these seats ( including only two - thirds of @entity7 voters ) would prefer to see the @entity125 in @entity25			2
in another positive finding , the majority of voters in all twelve seats polled believe the economy will do well for both the country and their own families in the coming year – suggesting that @entity7 ’s focus on the cost of living ‘ crisis ’ may be running out of steam .			2

survey of eight @entity3 - held marginal seats shows each one falling to @entity7
poll in four @entity7 - held swing areas shows only one winnable for @entity3
the study was conducted by former @entity3 treasurer @entity2
