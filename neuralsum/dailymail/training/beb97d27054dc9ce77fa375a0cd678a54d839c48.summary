in the heated yoga studio , the sweat is beginning to form on my upper lip			1
just a few minutes ago , we were warming up with gentle sun salutations – the traditional flowing move that opens most yoga classes			1
now i ’m holding 6lb hand weights and huffing and puffing my way through squats , performed on a step platform for maximum intensity			1
and , led by @entity14 , a ponytailed hunk who looks as if he should be modelling in @entity17 , it is becoming clear that this is n’t going to be yoga as my red - faced classmates and i know it			1
stretch and bend : yoga devotees @entity24 and @entity26 are pictured here leaving a class in @entity28 , @entity29 i ’m at the new @entity31 conditioning class at the slick @entity33 studio on @entity35 ’s @entity34 : one of several ‘ yoga bootcamp ’ - style classes to have sprung up across @entity35 , where gentle stretching and meditative breathing techniques meet high - intensity cardio drills			1
inventor @entity40 says : ‘ as much as i love yoga , i ’ve always believed in cross training to stay in peak condition			1
you ca n’t just do one kind of workout – you need to shock your body to see any real change			1
’ and so she created a class ‘ where you would leave feeling physically challenged , but also calm and grounded ’			1
@entity53 fans @entity55 's @entity54 is a 75 minute workout popular with celebrities like @entity24 as well as a yoga warm - up and cool - down , some of the muscle - quaking conditioning moves mimic yoga poses – like the ‘ supta baddha konasana ’ sit - ups , gruelling crunches with your legs splayed and soles together for an intense core workout			1
the yogic principal of ‘ darana ’ – or concentration – is also employed throughout , while @entity40 encourages the use of a mantra , a sacred word or phrase of encouragement , to help you stay the distance			1
‘ a lot of the time it ’s the mind that gives up before the body , ’ she explains			2
a similar principal lies behind the success of @entity55 ’s @entity54 , an excruciating 75 minutes already a favourite among a-listers including actress @entity24			2
@entity55 describes the workout as ‘ a morph of yoga - based breath and meditation , coupled with a sculpting , bootcamp - style class ’			1
using repetitive movements to music to work a muscle group , you soon enter what @entity55 calls the pain room – ‘ which is when i cue the breath ’ , she says			2
‘ you get to that place where the panic button goes off and you think ‘ ‘ no way ’ ’ , but by focusing on their breathing , i want people to learn that they can simply observe what ’s going on for them while they finish the set			2
’ some devotees reportedly experience a physical change after just a few sessions			2
back at @entity33 , @entity14 is wrapping up class with a traditional yoga relaxation			1
as my heartbeat returns to normal , the hard work is soon a distant memory and i leave relaxed , calm and focused – but dripping in sweat			2
there are hundreds of more rigorous yoga classes			1
try : the @entity119 , @entity120 @entity121 , @entity122 the @entity123 , @entity124 or an online class at @entity126 @entity127 ’s gone dairy - free and @entity129 ’s doing the 5:2 diet – and looked every inch the statesman ( although a few inches less , thankfully , than last time around ) when he delivered the @entity133 this week			2
even @entity134 has taking up kickboxing			0
at last , our politicians seem to be following president @entity138 and @entity139 in setting a healthy example			0
@entity138 holds meetings from his treadmill and @entity139 reversed his heart disease and lost two stone by going vegan in 2011			0
where @entity147 leads , @entity146 is n’t far behind			0
but have our alpha males finally realised what @entity35 ’s twenty and thirtysomething women have known for ages – that eating a healthy diet and keeping fit are the best ways to stay at the top of your game ? healthy chancellor : @entity129 is following the 5:2 diet and showed off his weight loss this week , while @entity127 is now dairy free media mogul @entity162 ’s new book thrive encourages us to reconsider traditional notions of ‘ success ’ and to think about our overall sense of wellbeing			0
‘ in the course of achieving it all , have we left ourselves behind ? ’ she asked when i interviewed her on the topic			0
her top tips ? get more sleep and learn how to master technology so that you control it , not the other way around			0
a disgusting fermented yeast called kombucha appears to be the new coconut water			0
all my hip friends are toting bottles of the brew , which promises to aid detoxification , boost immunity and keep joints healthy			0
hardcore devotees even brew their own from a ‘ mother ’ yeast culture , which can be quite dangerous			0
personally , i think it ’s like drinking fizzy vinegar			0
@entity193 @entity192 of @entity35 ’s trendy @entity194 ( @entity195 is a regular ) has told me he sometimes plays reggae to his clients to help them meditate			0
‘ your brain “ entrains ” to the rhythms around you , and reggae tends to have about 60 beats per minute – the speed of a slow heartbeat – which tends to slow you down as a result , ’ he said			0
no wonder they ’re all so laid back in @entity208			0
