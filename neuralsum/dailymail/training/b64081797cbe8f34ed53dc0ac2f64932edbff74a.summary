’ @entity6 resident @entity64 , 76 , said : ‘ the council does not speak for the people of @entity6 , and it certainly does n’t speak for me			0

his dragon - slaying legend is thought to have begun as an allegory of @entity126 's persecution of @entity113			0
‘ i think if anything this will harm understanding of @entity5 people , and it feeds into the ideas that some people have of “ oh , here they go again , pandering to the needs of @entity5 people ” , when actually it is not offensive			2
‘ i can see why they have done this , but it really is too far			0
' they are being overly sensitive , and making assumptions about what @entity5 will be offended by			2
‘ in actual fact we are normal people			0
' we have a sense of humour and have the same concerns as everyone else - we are not just some single group			0
’ there is no mosque or prayer centre in @entity6 , meaning the few members of the @entity156 are forced to go to @entity157 or nearby @entity158 in order to pray .			0
