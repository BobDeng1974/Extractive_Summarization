by @entity0 published : 03:14 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 03:22 est , 20 june 2012 in the months before the terrorist attacks of september 2001 , the @entity2 unit dedicated to hunting for @entity4 complained that it was running out of money			2
analysts considered the likelihood of catching the terror leader to be extremely low , according to government records published yesterday			0
the declassified documents , dated between 1992 and 2004 , are heavily blacked out and offer little new information about what the @entity13 knew about the @entity16 plot before 2001			1
priority : it has emerged that the hunt for @entity4 , pictured here in tv footage broadcast after the 9/11 attacks , had been underfunded prior to the terrorist outrage in @entity24 many of the files are cited in the @entity27 , published in 2004			1
the commission determined the failure that led to 9/11 was a lack of imagination , and @entity13 intelligence agencies did not connect the dots that could have prevented the attacks			2
the @entity35 obtained the documents through a @entity38 request and published them on its website			0
an april 2000 document from the @entity2 's @entity4 unit alluded to a budgetary cash crunch that was cutting into the agency 's efforts to track the terror leader			1
outrage : smoke pouring from @entity47 in @entity24 after its hit by a plane used as a weapon by terrorist from @entity4 's international network at that time , @entity16 was a major concern to @entity13 intelligence agencies because of the 1998 @entity13 embassy bombings in @entity55 and @entity56 that killed many , including two @entity2 employees			1
@entity4 had declared a holy war against the @entity13 , and the @entity2 had received multiple warnings that @entity16 intended to strike the @entity13 a heavily blacked - out document titled @entity61 said ' need forward movement on supplemental soonest '			1
the supplemental budget was still being reviewed by the national security council and @entity66			0
because of budgetary constraints , the @entity4 unit would move from an ' offensive to defensive posture ' , the document said			2
this meant that officials feared they would have to shelve some of their more elaborate proposals to track @entity16 and instead rely on existing resources			2
the @entity76 , referenced in the same document , was one of the more expensive programs the @entity2 ran at the time , according to a source familiar with the initiative			0
aftermath : the @entity47 on the sixth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks when attempts to track down @entity4 were seriously stepped up but would fail to succeed for another five years huge impact : the @entity24 sky line with the @entity47 before the @entity4 inspired 9/11 attack - but new documents reveal that before the terror operation attempts to track down the @entity16 were underfunded the program involved paying off @entity2 tipsters who monitored @entity4 followers traveling through @entity96			1
the source spoke anonymously as a condition of describing the sensitive program			0
the documents do not make clear whether the portion of the budget in question was passed			0
but they hint at complaints later detailed publicly after the 9/11 attacks by previous directors of the @entity4 unit that the @entity110 and @entity111 administrations did not fully appreciate the severity of the threat , and as a result failed to fully fund their operations			2
the documents also show that @entity13 officials were concerned that @entity4 was using @entity120 's national airline to carry in vast cash reserves when he was sheltered by the ruling @entity123 mullahs in the late 1990s			1
the @entity2 's @entity124 in june 1999 urged the imposition of sanctions on @entity127 , then controlled by the @entity123 , in order to put pressure on @entity4 's cash flow			1
his cash flow reportedly depended heavily on flights from the @entity134 into @entity120			2
the document said : ' closing of @entity127 's @entity134 offices would force them to find alternative - and most likely less secure - carriers , routes and methods for moving @entity4 's cash			1
' knowledge : @entity13 officials were concerned that @entity4 was using @entity120 's national airline to carry in vast cash reserves in the late 1990s , but there are hints that previous directors of the @entity4 unit that the @entity110 and @entity111 administrations did not fully appreciate the severity of the threat later that year , the @entity13 and @entity151 imposed harsh sanctions on @entity120 and its airline , shutting down all flights and closing @entity127 's offices abroad			1
the newly released files also offer details about the subsequent investigations into the attacks			0
in one case , the @entity13 intelligence community investigated a link between one of the hijackers and the @entity165 - a connection that was later proved false but that the @entity66 used in its campaign to connect the attacks to @entity169			2
according to a december , 2001 , @entity2 report that was sent to the @entity171 , the @entity2 had already made a preliminary determination that 9/11 hijacker @entity174 had not in fact traveled to @entity175 in the @entity176 in may 2000 to rendezvous with a senior official of the @entity165			0
@entity174 was an @entity178 national who piloted @entity179 into the @entity47			0
that he would have met with the @entity165 was significant for intelligence officials looking for a connection between @entity16 and @entity169			1
lack of focus : it is suggested that president @entity110 and vice president @entity184 ( left to right pictured in 2004 ) were reluctant to fund expensive @entity2 programmes to track down @entity4 for the 9/11 attacks but just one day after the report was sent to the @entity66 , vice president @entity184 claimed on @entity189 's @entity188 that it had been ' pretty confirmed ' that @entity174 had gone to @entity175 several months before the attack			2
according to the @entity193 report , it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity after a @entity196 with a similar name tried to get into the @entity176 but was turned away			0
the document was the basis for a footnote in chapter seven of the 9/11 report			0
even though the information about @entity174 meeting with the @entity206 was later disproved , it still resonated with those bent on going to war with @entity169			0
the hundreds of pages of @entity2 files released tuesday include a chronology of the agency 's efforts to catch @entity4			1
a march 2004 @entity2 report entitled , the rise of @entity4 and @entity16 and the @entity215 , discusses the likelihood of the @entity2 capturing @entity4 in the late 1990s using @entity120 to do the job			1
the @entity2 estimated that none of the available @entity120 units had more than a 10 percent chance of capturing the heavily guarded @entity4			1
another option was using @entity223 , leader of the @entity224 , who was friendly with the @entity2 and fighting the @entity123			0
' even if he agreed to do so , his chances of success against the @entity123 were judged to be less than five percent , ' the report said			0
@entity16 operatives killed @entity223 on september 9 , 2001			2
president @entity111 was criticised for not doing more to catch @entity4			0
but the documents show it would n't have been an easy task , though some at the @entity2 were still hopeful they could get him			0
' the odds of success are iffy , ' @entity234 , who ran the @entity2 's @entity4 unit , said in a 1998 secret memo that was among the declassified documents released tuesday			1
' and the thing could blow up at any point along the way			0
' it would take the @entity13 government another 13 years to catch and kill @entity4 .			1

complaints that intelligence agency 's hunt was underfunded revealed in new documents
@entity16 was already a major concern after @entity13 @entity253 bombings
@entity13 officials knew @entity4 was flying vast cash reserves to @entity120 in the late 1990s
