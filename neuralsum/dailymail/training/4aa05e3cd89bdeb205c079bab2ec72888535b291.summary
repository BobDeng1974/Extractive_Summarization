a nasal spray being developed as a potential vaccine for the deadly ebola virus has been found to be effective			1
scientists at the @entity4 discovered the breathable vaccine offers long - term protection during pre-clinical trials with monkeys			1
since the current outbreak erupted in @entity11 earlier this year , almost 5,000 people have lost their lives - the majority in @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			0
a number of injectable experimental vaccines are being trialled in the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , with plans to extend human trials into other parts of @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
a nasal spray being developed as a potential vaccine for the ebola virus ( pictured under the microscope ) has been found to protect monkeys in pre-clinical trials there are vaccination trials ongoing in the @entity19 and @entity20			1
it is hoped the first results will be available next year but researchers in @entity39 , @entity40 , say their small pre-clinical study is the only proof to date that a single dose of a non-injectable vaccine against @entity45 is long - lasting			1
they claim the discovery could have ' significant global implications in controlling future outbreaks '			0
a breathable vaccine could overcome the logistical obstacles of storing , transporting and administering injectable vaccines in parts of @entity11 most afflicted by the virus , the researchers said			1
the work will be presented tomorrow at the @entity55 in @entity56			0
@entity57 , a graduate in pharmacy and professor dr @entity59 , and dr @entity62 and his team at the @entity64 in @entity65 , developed the vaccine over seven years			1
it was found to improve survival of immunised non-human primates from 67 per cent to 100 per cent , after challenge with 1,000 plaque forming units of @entity72 150 days after immunisation			0
it is significant because only 50 per cent of the primates given the vaccine by the standard route - an injection into the muscle - survived challenge			1
ms @entity57 said : ' @entity45 causes devastating outbreaks with fatality rates of 25 to 90 per cent in @entity11 and @entity83			0
' although progress has been made in understanding the virus ' biology , no licensed vaccines or treatments currently exist			1
' there is a desperate need for a vaccine that not only prevents the continued transmission from person to person , but also aids in controlling future incidences			2
' ' the main advantage of our vaccine platform over the others in clinical testing is the long - lasting protection after a single intranasal dose , ' dr @entity59 added			1
prayers are said for a victim of @entity45 in @entity106 , @entity14 , as healthcare workers prepare to remove the body from public hearth workers cover the body of a man suspected of dying from the ebola virus on the outskirts of @entity115 , @entity15			2
the @entity116 said this week that the rate of infection in @entity15 appears to be falling but warned that the response effort must be kept up or the trend could be reversed ' this is important since the longevity of other vaccines for @entity45 that are currently being evaluated is not fully understood			2
' moreover , the nasal spray immunisation method is more attractive than a needle vaccine given the costs associated with syringe distribution , needle safety and disposal			2
' the current @entity45 outbreak in @entity11 is the largest and most complex epidemic since the virus was first discovered in 1976 , according to the @entity116			2
with a fatality rate currently as high as 70 per cent , officials have declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern			0
the next stage of dr @entity59 and her team 's research is a phase one clinical trial that tests the effectiveness of their vaccine in human volunteers			1
they also plan to further explore their initial data they have collected for the administration of the vaccine as a thin film under the tongue in non-human primates			2
the study was published in the online edition of the journal @entity158			0
a vaccine to protect millions from the ebola virus decades after it was first detected does not exist because the disease previously only affected poor @entity164 nations			1
the head of the @entity116 's scathing conclusion came as nearly 5,000 people have lost their lives to the hemorrhagic fever - the majority in @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			0
dr @entity171 , director general of the @entity116 , criticised drugs companies for turning their backs on ' markets that can not pay '			0
@entity116 director general dr @entity171 said : ' why are clinicians still empty handed , with no vaccines and no cure ? because @entity45 has historically been confined to poor @entity164 nations ' she said the current outbreak - the most deadly in history - has exposed two @entity116 arguments ' that have fallen on deaf ears for decades '			1
addressing the regional committee for @entity11 in @entity185 yesterday , dr @entity183 said : ' @entity45 emerged nearly four decades ago			0
why are clinicians still empty handed , with no vaccines and no cure ? ' because @entity45 has historically been confined to poor @entity164 nations			2
' the r&d ( research and development ) incentive is virtually non-existent			0
' a profit - driven industry does not invest in products for markets that can not pay			0
' @entity116 has been trying to make this issue visible for ages			0
now people can see it for themselves			0

scientists at the @entity4 are developing the breathable vaccine
it has been shown to protect monkeys against the deadly virus
next step is to test vaccine on humans in phase one clinical trials
researchers said *respiratory* vaccine could overcome logistical *problems* of storing , transporting and administering injectable vaccines
