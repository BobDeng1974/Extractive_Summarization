@entity0 said that this was not the first time he had been abused because of the colour of his skin			1
@entity0 , who stood on that @entity6 platform facing down the morons and the bullies and their atavism and their hate			1
@entity0 , who stood with his hands by his sides , implacable and angry , defiant and unbowed , facing down the @entity14 mob on the train			1
‘ you know , i live with racism , ’ @entity0 told @entity16			1
‘ i was not really surprised by what happened to me , even if it was a first in the subway			1
’ @entity0 attempts to board the @entity6 carriage but is refused entry by racist @entity14 fans @entity26 's footage went on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident he had never met the @entity14 fans before but @entity0 recognised the ugly faces that stared out from that carriage at @entity31 on tuesday evening			1
he lives in a capital whose racial tensions were captured so starkly by the film @entity35 20 years ago , a capital which is newly familiar with heinous hate crimes			2
@entity0 knew those faces and , sadly , so did we			2
because racism , sometimes cunningly concealed , sometimes bold as brass , still haunts @entity41 football			1
many are in denial about that			1
many still seek to portray it as a fantasy perpetuated by the politically correct			1
others blame the media for highlighting a problem that they say does not exist			2
most , including football ’s governing bodies , do n’t want to confront it			1
they say they do but when it comes to hard choices , they back off			1
they would prefer to talk about initiatives , t - shirts , tv adverts and catchy slogans			2
they deal in lip service			1
i have had first - hand experience of that so i know how it goes			2
i know how difficult it can get when you seek to highlight even relatively trivial incidents			1
two years ago , @entity72 played a @entity74 qualifier in @entity75 and a few groups of fans sang a song about burning the @entity80 brothers , @entity81 and @entity82 , on a bonfire			2
the song was sung against the backdrop of the racial abuse case that pitted the @entity86 against former @entity72 captain @entity87			2
it was laden with meaning			2
i heard it , some of my press colleagues heard it and some @entity72 fans among the vast majority who were n’t singing it , heard it , too			2
the @entity102 responded by launching a half - hearted inquiry			2
they did not want their reputation sullied or a fine to be levied			2
they said they could n’t find any evidence the song had been sung			2
i asked why witness accounts did not constitute evidence			2
they threw those of us who heard the chants under the bus			2
@entity118 scores during @entity72 's 8 - 0 win in @entity75 where racist chants were clearly audible in a way , that is why what happened in @entity124 on tuesday feels , amid the disgust and shame , like an important step forward			1
it was n’t a surprise to most observers of the @entity41 game			1
it was n’t anything new			2
except that what happened to @entity136 is there on video and with audio			2
@entity26 , who shot the footage , performed a great service to @entity41 football			1
the plausible deniability that football exercised time after time , including in @entity75 , is gone			1
this time , there is no denying it			1
this time , there is no sanitising it			1
this time , there is no hiding from it			1
admitting that race is a real problem in @entity41 football again , admitting we have not made as much progress as we thought we had , is a critical first step			1
oh , we ’ve made some advances , for sure			2
fans do not throw bananas as they used to when @entity161 ’s @entity160 ran past in the @entity162			0
but racial prejudice is on the rise in our society			0
somehow , we have reached a point where our jewish community is , once more , scared for its safety			0
@entity170 , in different forms , seems to be multiplying			0
look at what happens when articulate men such as @entity173 or @entity174 speak out about race on @entity176 : they are doused with foul abuse			0
it is time for football to start taking some bold steps			1
it is not enough to keep playing safe and hoping the problem goes away			0
the trailblazing @entity160 ( right ) runs to training with @entity161 manager @entity185 @entity174 ( left ) and @entity173 are routinely abused on @entity176 when they speak out about race this should not be about isolating @entity14 who are in many ways a model of multi-culturalism , owned by a @entity192 jew who appointed a @entity193 as manager and a @entity195 as technical director and whose employees have overseen a progressive @entity199 initiative			0
@entity14 have acted swiftly and strongly			0
they have been unequivocal in their condemnation of what happened			0
@entity202 said he was ‘ ashamed ’			0
but this is not just about @entity14			0
this has to go further than merely punishing the scum who repelled @entity0 from that train and chanted how proud they were to be racist			0
prison sentences , banning orders ; that ’s easy			0
that just scratches the surface			0
these people are produced by our society , not by our football			1
there is no quick fix			0
but there are ways forward ; ways that will take courage and perseverance and brave leadership			0
it ’s about time , for instance , that the @entity228 stood up and led the way by introducing a version of the @entity232 ’s @entity231 for the lower leagues			1
there is no point involving the @entity236 yet			0
most aspiring black coaches do n’t have enough experience to manage in the top flight because they have been denied opportunities lower down the pyramid			0
@entity202 ( left ) was visibly angered when addressing the racist behaviour on the @entity6 @entity14 owner @entity243 was said to be ' disgusted ' by the incident in the @entity246 capital the idea that getting a job in @entity41 football is a meritocracy , and that would - be managers are not discriminated against because of their ethnicity , is a joke			1
more and more people accept it is a joke			0
more and more people acknowledge it is a stain on our game that there are only four black managers in our league ( four more than there were at the start of the season )			0
it is time for the @entity102 and the @entity228 to accept that the balance needs to be redressed ; that black aspiring managers should at least be given the chance to put their case when a managerial vacancy arises			1
they have delayed long enough			0
they must take steps to fix it and , in the process , send out a message to morons like the men on the @entity6 that we value diversity and the rule of talent in our game			0
enough of saying there is no problem			0
enough of laissez - faire			0
enough of thinking that @entity41 football will heal itself			1
when new @entity294 boss @entity293 , the only black manager in the @entity236 , spoke on thursday , he was asked if he had suffered racism in his career			1
‘ a lot , ’ he said			0
he did n’t elaborate but my guess is that part of what he was referring to were the job applications that went unanswered , the coaching qualifications that went unheeded			0
@entity293 , pictured during @entity294 's defeat at @entity305 , says he has suffered ' a lot ' of racism in his career @entity309 manager @entity308 is one of four black managers plying their trade in @entity72 former @entity14 striker @entity312 has led @entity313 to the top of @entity315 former @entity72 international @entity316 is in charge at @entity318 , who are fourth from bottom in @entity315 ‘ racism is not something that gets eradicated , ’ said @entity293			1
‘ it gets shuffled about and hidden in places you would n’t believe			0
’ when @entity0 tried to get on that train , he did not give up			0
he was repelled and tried again			0
@entity41 football needs to follow his example			1
it ’s time to push back			1
it ’s time to stop pretending everything is ok			1
penalty decisions are not always clear - cut			0
what was @entity333 supposed to do at @entity335 on monday night when the @entity337 goalkeeper , @entity336 , came hurtling out of his goal , launched himself at the ball and missed ? was he supposed to take the hit and risk serious injury ? was he supposed to hurdle the keeper , do everything he could to stay on his feet and accept that the scoring opportunity that should have been his was gone ? @entity336 dives in at @entity333 's feet before the @entity348 striker took evasive action @entity333 touched the ball past the @entity337 keeper with referee @entity352 awarding a penalty to @entity348 or , having taken evasive action and stumbled when he landed , was he entitled to go down ? surely a forward should not be penalised because of a keeper ’s rash challenge ? @entity333 did nothing wrong			1
if the keeper throws himself at the ball and misses , impeding an attacker in the process , he has to take the consequences			0
it is interesting that @entity368 ’s @entity367 400m champion @entity366 still feels entitled to criticise @entity370 president @entity369 for suggesting there is a crisis in the sport , because of allegations made about officials covering up doping in @entity192			0
@entity366 should have taken a minute , remembered that she once missed three drug tests in succession and accepted that , when it comes to doping matters , her voice carries very , very little authority			0
@entity366 , who won @entity367 gold in 2008 , once missed three drugs tests in succession			0

racism , sometimes cunningly concealed , sometimes bold as brass , still haunts @entity41 football
many are in denial about that . many still seek to portray it as a fantasy perpetuated by the politically correct
most , including football 's governing bodies , do *n't* want to confront it . not really . they say they do but when it comes to hard choices , they back off
@entity26 , who shot the shocking footage , performed a great service to @entity41 football
this time , there is no denying it . this time , there is no sanitising it . this time , there is no hiding from it
