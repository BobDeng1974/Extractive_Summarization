by @entity0 a woman born without a vagina has had one made using skin from her thigh			1
the 26 - year - old anonymous woman had surgery in @entity7 after discovering she had @entity10 ( @entity9 ) syndrome when she was 14			1
this is characterised by the absence of the vagina , womb and cervix and is a congenital abnormality affecting one in 5,000 women			0
a woman born without a vagina has had one made using skin from her thigh , surgeons have reported plastic surgeons in @entity24 , @entity25 , used an unusual technique whereby a vaginoplasty was performed using the internal skin of the woman 's thigh			1
this allowed surgeons to avoid opening the woman 's abdomen to get a portion of the colon , which is the usual way to perform the procedure , according to surgeon @entity37 , head of the hospital 's @entity39 and @entity40 department			1
the surgery was performed in 2012 but has only come to light now after a paper about the case was reported in the journal @entity47 , published by the @entity48 ( @entity49 )			2
it follows the news last month that four woman suffering from the same syndrome were given new artificial vaginas grown in a laboratory			1
their new vaginas were engineered by scientists at @entity60 's @entity59 in the @entity61 , using the women 's own cells			1
one of the women who received a new vagina , interviewed by @entity66 , says the procedure helped to normalise her life			0
she said : ' at the beginning it was n't easy , thinking that a part of your body was going to be made in a laboratory			0
it was difficult to understand			0
@entity78 demonstrates the process where four young women born with abnormal or missing vaginas were implanted with lab - grown versions made from their own cells ' but as the years pass and with the good results , you find a way of life which is different but not too far from normality			1
' women with @entity9 have normally functioning ovaries and so will experience the normal signs of puberty but will not have periods or be able to conceive			2
the external genitalia are completely normal which is why @entity9 is n’t usually discovered until women are in their teenage years			2
it ’s usually discovered when the woman tries to has sex or fails to get her period			0
many women are able to create a vaginal canal using dilation treatment , which uses cylinder shaped dilators of different sizes to stretch the muscles			0
however , if this is unsuccessful then surgery will be used to stretch the vaginal canal			0
following treatment women are able to have intercourse and can have their eggs removed and fertilised to be used in surrogacy .			0

the 26 - year - old anonymous woman had surgery in @entity7
was *diagnosed* with @entity119 ( @entity9 ) syndrome
surgeons took skin from the woman 's inner thigh , rather than her colon
follows on from @entity61 scientists growing four vaginas in a laboratory
