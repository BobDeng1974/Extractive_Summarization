by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has told @entity4 clubs to forget about pulling players out of @entity7 duty just because they are tired			1
international football returns to @entity7 next week and public interest in the national side is at its lowest ebb for many years			2
as a result of @entity7 's miserable @entity15 campaign , as few as 35,000 fans could be at @entity16 to watch the @entity7 take on @entity17 in a friendly			1
warning : @entity7 manager @entity2 insists his players can not use international breaks as rests but even though the public are not interested in the match , or the qualifier against @entity24 five days later , top - flight clubs and the @entity7 players they have on their books should not view the upcoming international get together as a holiday , @entity2 insists			1
whenever @entity2 has to choose a squad , he wants his players fully focused when they report for duty , and he feels it should not fall upon his shoulders to rest players if they start to fatigue			1
' the players ca n't regard the international breaks as the unofficial winter break , like a lot of club teams do , they have to accept it , ' the @entity7 manager said			1
' the national team plays seven , eight or nine games a year			0
i think we should have the right to accept that those players are going to be available and play for us and if they need a rest then i think it might be incumbent upon the clubs to give them one			0
' @entity2 insists @entity51 's appointment as @entity7 captain will not lead to burnout for the 28 - year - old			1
@entity51 was appointed @entity55 captain just over a fortnight ago , but @entity2 says the striker will not have too much extra work to do with @entity7 now that he is skipper of the national team too			1
' being captain wo n't affect his work load , ' @entity2 said			2
' nothing more will be asked for him			0
he will have to sit beside me at press conferences			0
rest : @entity2 says @entity4 managers can not treat international weeks as ' unofficial winter breaks ' ' if it was necessary to leave a player out we could , but we have started to create an environment here where the players actually wo n't want to sit out			1
' with @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 having retired , @entity51 is by far the most experienced member of the 22 - man squad selected for the upcoming double - header			2
the second most experienced player in the party is @entity79 , the 48 - cap midfielder who can not hold down a regular first - team place at @entity81			0
despite the lack of leaders available to him , @entity2 is optimistic about the next two years			2
the former @entity85 manager insists @entity7 will qualify for @entity86 - although that is not hard given that the top two teams from each group qualify automatically - and he is confident his team will put on a good show in the tournament its self			2
the 67 - year - old has cited @entity96 's recovery from mediocrity to world champions as a reason for optimism			2
' i am not prepared to approach this with doom and gloom , ' he said			0
@entity2 knows he must not let the disappointment of @entity7 's @entity15 campaign linger if he is to drag the team out of the gutter though			1
' i must not allow the fact that those results went badly to totally blast out of the water all the things we want to do , ' added @entity2 , who said @entity7 's early elimination in @entity115 was down to ' fine margins '			1
' the players have to make certain they ca n't allow the negativity to impact upon them or it will ruin their chances			0
new start : @entity7 may face @entity17 at @entity16 on wednesday night with less than 35,000 fans ' you have to be mentally strong and deal with it , because we ca n't turn the clock back			1
' @entity2 is yet to make his mind up whether he is interested in managing @entity7 beyond the summer of 2016 , when his contract expires			1
only an impressive @entity129 would lead to a public clamour for him to remain , and in two years ' time he will be 12 months shy of his 70th birthday			0
that said , there is hardly a stellar list of @entity136 candidates out there waiting in the wings			0
@entity2 will not make a decision on his future for some time , though , it seems			2
' i have n't given that a thought at the moment , ' he said			0
' i have to make sure at the end of my contract that i am not looking in the mirror and saying ' i wish i had done something different '			0
' in 2016 who knows what will happen			0
maybe i will want to continue , maybe they ( the @entity152 ) wo n't want me , maybe i will want to retire			0

@entity2 will not allow players off @entity7 duty because they are tired
@entity7 boss says international weeks are not ' unofficial winter breaks '
