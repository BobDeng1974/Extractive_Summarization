they have n't always enjoyed the kindest of press but that was n't enough to stop the @entity4 from spending the afternoon touring a newsroom			1
but this was far from being your average @entity8 outfit			0
instead , @entity10 was at @entity11 - the world 's largest paper for children			1
dressed in a tailored brown suit by @entity15 , the @entity4 was all smiles as she toured the newsroom , shaking hands with editorial staff and budding journalists alike			1
grand opening : the @entity4 opened the new offices of children 's newspaper , @entity11 among them was @entity26 , 11 , who was trying her hand at reporting , and her colleague - budding photographer @entity29 , also 11			1
as the duchess was introduced to the newspaper 's staff @entity29 snapped away like a seasoned professional , while @entity26 questioned her in a way that would have done @entity34 proud			2
@entity10 , who is patron of the @entity35 , features in the next issue of @entity11 , in which she answers questions on her reading habits			2
@entity26 , 11 , from @entity40 in north @entity41 , said : ' she wanted me to choose a photo of her for @entity11 and then she said that if she could be any book character she would be @entity45			1
' i asked her why and she said she would love to have her fingers stuck in honey			0
i thought that was a good excuse			0
' @entity29 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , said he only discovered he was going to be taking photographs of a member of the royal family when a camera was thrust into his hands this morning - his very first day			2
looking good : @entity10 was on glamorous form in a brown @entity15 suit and her trademark pearls well done : @entity60 , who was flanked by budding reporter @entity26 , 11 , appeared to enjoy the visit he said : ' it has been been a real honour to meet the @entity4			1
she is just like everyone else and was talking to me like an adult in a normal way			0
' after meeting the newspaper staff @entity10 was told about the work of @entity70 - and she was given a taste of how it will work when she took part in a @entity75 session between children at the @entity11 office and a group of school children in @entity80 , who sang for the duchess			1
available as a printed paper in the @entity83 and digitally abroad , @entity11 has more than two million young readers and has racked up a number of awards for its contribution to children 's issues			1
among them is @entity70 , an interactive web - based communication platform that is freely available to children across the world			2
impressive : also on hand to greet the @entity95 was 11 - year - old @entity29 - a would - be photographer on deadline ! @entity10 shared a joke with 11 - year - old @entity26 during the tour of the newspaper 's offices when @entity10 arrived , the young reporters were using the tool to chat with their counterparts in @entity80 - one of the many countries to benefit from the technology			1
it was all a far cry from the @entity95 ' first visit of the day which , with prince @entity108 , had been to the offices of this newspaper in @entity41 's @entity112			2
the royal couple were touring the @entity114 , which shares the building with @entity116 , and met the paper 's editorial staff and its owner , @entity119			0
@entity108 also shared a joke with the newspaper 's royal editor @entity121 as he and the duchess posed for a photo in front of an @entity114 banner , quipping ' cheap publicity ! ' as he obliged			0
nevertheless , the heir to the throne still managed to make an impression , with football columnist @entity131 describing him as an ' absolute hero '			0
' he is my absolute hero in this country , ' he said			0
' at the risk of sounding like a footballer in a cup final , this is a dream come true meeting this gentleman			0
' real deal : earlier , @entity108 was at @entity143 - the headquarters of @entity41 's @entity114 warm welcome : the royal couple were greeted by @entity114 editor , @entity147 ( left )			0
