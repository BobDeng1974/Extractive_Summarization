by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 19:37 est , 29 november 2012 there are many foods that you might think of as quintessentially @entity4 : baguettes , snails , a slice or two of fromage , garlic , onions and of course frogs ’ legs			1
but when it comes to choosing drinks that sum up the @entity18 experience , there is only one contender : a large glass of vino			0
but in reality , the @entity23 are falling out of love with their most famous tipple , official figures show			0
popularity plunge : consumption levels of wine in @entity4 are at their lowest ever levels , according to research by the @entity4 @entity33 fewer than one in five @entity4 adults – 17 per cent – now drink a glass of wine every day , the statistics from @entity4 ’s ministry of agriculture reveal			1
@entity39 , the official who oversaw the research , said the trend owed much to increasing awareness of the perceived health dangers associated with regular consumption of alcohol – particularly liver disease – along with the nation ’s economic troubles			1
‘ there has also been a real shift in consumption habits : fizzy drinks and fruit juices are taking the place of wine on the @entity4 table , ’ she added			1
stricter drink - driving laws have also put many off having a few glasses of wine after work , as would have been normal in the past			0
in 1980 , wine would be served at , on average , one meal in two			0
by 2010 that had fallen to one in four			0
the number of teetotallers in @entity4 – a group which includes former president @entity66 – has now reached 38 per cent , the figures show			1
the findings reflect a long - term trend that has seen @entity4 ’s average wine consumption fall from 160 litres per adult per year in 1965 to 57 litres in 2010 – equivalent to a drop from three glasses to one glass per person per day			1
wine consumption graph.jpg but @entity4 consumption of wine still outstrips that of their @entity79 counterparts , who drink 28 litres per person each year , roughly equivalent to three glasses a week			1
study co-author @entity82 said : ‘ alcohol in general and wine in particular have become a weekend thing , to be consumed in a convivial or celebratory setting			0
’ @entity4 is the world ’s second largest wine producer , with only @entity88 ahead , and produces between 7billion and 8billion bottles a year			2
the @entity23 are traditionally the biggest consumers of their own wines but the downward consumer trend has left wine producers relying increasingly on foreign markets			0
however , demand for wine has also been falling in many of those other markets			0
the result has been a wine glut , often called the wine lake , which has led to the distillation of wine into industrial alcohol as well as a government programme to pay @entity4 farmers to pull up their grape vines			2
the market for champagne as well as the demand for the expensive ranked or classified wines has been relatively unscathed by the drinking downturn but these constitute only about 5 per cent of @entity4 production .			2

study by @entity4 @entity33 reveals major fall in consumption
average @entity4 person now consumes equivalent of a glass per day
health *concerns* and economic worries *blamed* for fall in popularity
