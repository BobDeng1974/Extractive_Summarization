deadline : the @entity0 ( @entity0 ) is considering introducing a time limit which could block victims of @entity4 's biggest mis - selling scandal from making a claim ( file photo ) @entity29 , of @entity30 , said : ' the banks have been trying to pull a fast one with asking for a time limit for years			1
' to make it work fairly for consumers they 'd need to put out a multi-million pound advertising campaign over the few years before the limit , so people know they have been mis - sold			1
' more importantly they 'd need to ensure they stop rejecting people who they know the ombudsman would order them to pay out to , knowing most people wo n't take it this far			0
' i ca n't see either of those things happening , so a time limit should be a strict no - go			2
' tens of millions of @entity8 policies were sold between 1990 and 2010 to people taking out loans , mortgages and credit cards			1
they were supposed to protect borrowers who fell ill or lost their jobs			0
but banks routinely flogged the cover to customers who could never make a claim because they were ineligible to do so			2
often , victims had no idea they had even been paying for the cover for years			0
since the scandal broke , banks have been inundated with @entity8 complaints			1
although many of these come from actual wronged customers , others are driven by claims from management firms who sign people up by bombarding them with texts and phone calls			0
@entity29 ( pictured ) , of @entity30 , said : ' the banks have been trying to pull a fast one with asking for a time limit for years alongside millions of legitimate claims , banks say they have also spent vast sums wading through vexatious and speculative claims made by these firms			1
the independent @entity83 says it is receiving around 4,000 @entity8 complaints a week , down from a peak of 12,000			2
it finds in the customer 's favour in roughly two - thirds of cases			0
@entity90 , founder of the @entity91 , said : ' i fear that the majority of people who would lose out by a deadline would be those who are vulnerable or elderly			0
the banks had their hands in customers ' pockets for years			0
victims should n't be allowed to be the fall guy a second time around			0
