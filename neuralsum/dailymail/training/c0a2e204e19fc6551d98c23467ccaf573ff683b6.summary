by @entity0 last updated at 12:55 am on 19th august 2011 deceit : dr @entity2 was banned from the roads for drink - driving and used a sample of clean blood from her own patient in @entity8 to try to con testers that she was all clear a family doctor has been found guilty of a ‘ grave abuse of trust ’ for taking blood from a patient and pretending it was her own in an attempt to beat a drink driving ban			1
dr @entity2 , 46 , claimed she was checking for an ‘ underlying medical condition ’ when she took a syringe of the female patient ’s blood			0
but she instead submitted the vial as if it were her blood to medical experts working for licensing authority the @entity25 – along with a forged signature from another doctor – in an effort to convince them she was sober after a string of drink driving convictions and a driving ban			1
a @entity35 panel heard that the married mother of four had sent the ‘ clean ’ sample of blood with the forged signature in an unsuccessful attempt to deceive the @entity25 and have her licence reinstated			1
the same day she had already submitted a genuine sample of her blood at the @entity43 in @entity44			0
confronted with two samples of blood bearing her name – one ‘ clean ’ and one containing ‘ abnormalities ’ – on may 26 last year , staff testing it for the @entity25 at the @entity51 became suspicious			0
she was required to give another sample and admitted her deception during a further blood test at the @entity55 on august 17 last year			0
but as the doctor left the room , and the nurse washed her hands , dr @entity2 snatched the blood vial and fled the hospital			0
in an apparent attempt to see if her blood would come out clean if tested , she sent a sample of it for analysis to the @entity67 in @entity44 – where she once worked – using forms filled out with a former patient ’s name			0
when her sample came back showing ‘ abnormalities ’ she accessed the surgery ’s computer to wipe all traces of it			0
dr @entity2 , of @entity44 , was found guilty of three charges of dishonesty by the @entity35 and suspended for 12 months for serious professional misconduct			1
@entity35 panel chairman dr @entity80 told dr @entity2 : ‘ the panel heard you took the blood from ms a under the pretence it was to be tested to discover if she had an underlying illness			1
dr @entity2 was formerly of the @entity67 in @entity8 ( pictured ) but has been suspended for a year ‘ the panel took a grave view of your abusing her trust in you in such a way			2
’ he added : ‘ your dishonest actions have the potential to undermine the reputation of the profession as a whole			0
’ dr @entity2 admitted the charges of dishonesty , but claimed they were ‘ sudden irrational decisions ’ – a view the @entity35 said was ‘ not credible ’			1
she was previously suspended by the @entity35 ’s fitness to practise panel in 2009 for a period of six months following a spate of drink - related incidents			1
the previous misconduct hearing was told her brushes with the law began in 2004 when she was convicted of drink driving and disqualified at @entity113 ’ @entity114			1
in january 2006 a practice nurse smelt alcohol on the doctor ’s breath ‘ from some feet away ’ while she was fitting a contraceptive coil			2
she was fired later the same month after she appeared drunk and smelling of alcohol at a surgery meeting			2
a further drink driving conviction followed in 2007 .			2

suspended by the @entity35 in 2004 , 2009 and in 2011 for working or driving under the influence of alcohol
