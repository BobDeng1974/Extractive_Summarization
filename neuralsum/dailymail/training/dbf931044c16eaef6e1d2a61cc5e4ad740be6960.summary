by @entity0 published : 18:54 est , 27 january 2013 updated : 18:59 est , 27 january 2013 @entity1 with barrister wife @entity3 - @entity2 the @entity4 was plunged into a farcical leadership crisis yesterday as little - known mp @entity1 was touted as @entity7 ’s replacement			1
the multi-millionaire mp for @entity9 was forced to declare his loyalty to the prime minister ‘ for now ’ as it emerged that an ‘ organised ’ group of backers has called on mps to support him as leader if mr @entity7 loses the 2015 general election			1
allies of the mixed race mp – who has drawn comparisons with @entity20 – have dubbed themselves the ‘ @entity9 set ’ , aping mr @entity7 ’s ‘ @entity23 set ’ of allies			1
insiders said the plans were evidence that mr @entity7 is unpopular with some backbench mps and a figure ‘ untainted ’ by serving as a @entity31 minister would be needed to replace him			1
the @entity32 can reveal that ‘ armed camps ’ of mps are now forming to support future leadership bids by @entity34 , @entity35 , backbencher @entity36 and @entity37			1
but the secret campaign on behalf of mr @entity1 , who has not served as a minister , was denounced as ‘ loopy ’ and ‘ deranged ’ last night as mps condemned the plotting against mr @entity7 in the same week that his promise of a referendum on @entity46 restored @entity4 fortunes			1
one senior conservative said : ‘ oh good			0
we ’re back to being the stupid party			0
’ several mps confirmed that friends of mr @entity1 have been asked to support him as leader – but they stressed that this would only be after 2015			1
but with his cover blown , mr @entity1 took to @entity56 to issue qualified support for the pm			1
‘ right now we ’re 100 per cent behind @entity7 , ’ he said , indicating that could change , before pledging : ‘ i would never stand against @entity7			2
’ mr @entity1 would not need to stand against mr @entity7 because a leadership election is triggered only if 46 @entity4 @entity51 demand a vote of no confidence , which would spark mr @entity7 ’s resignation were he to lose			1
mr @entity1 added : ‘ of course we talk about the long - term future of the party and the long - term success of the party , because we think it ’s the best thing for the @entity70 people			1
’ he claimed the comparisons with mr @entity20 were unfounded but pointed out : ‘ we share the same birthday			0
’ @entity1 allies such as @entity74 and @entity76 @entity75 are said to be impressed by the way he rose from a single parent home on a council estate to make a fortune put at £ 100million			2
@entity1 ( left ) mp for @entity9 was forced to declare his loyalty to the prime minister ( right ) @entity34 dines with @entity84 mr @entity75 was yesterday also forced to issue a declaration of loyalty			1
‘ i want and expect @entity7 , who i admire hugely and support as party leader completely , to lead the @entity4 into the next @entity89 and i also fully expect us to win that election , ’ he said			1
mr @entity1 , 47 , vehemently opposed the creation of the @entity31 , calling on mr @entity7 to run a minority administration			1
he also assiduously courted fellow @entity94 by proposing the abolition of expenses watchdog ipsa			0
@entity97 , the mp suspended after appearing in i ’m a celebrity , said he had ‘ leadership potential ’			2
another backer said : ‘ @entity1 has a fantastic back story			0
it is difficult to see how we get a majority at the next election			0
the assumption is that @entity7 will be stepping down			0
at that point we do n’t want a coalitionist who has been subject to the compromise and taint of government			0
there are a number of people like @entity1 who are unhappy with the direction of the party			0
’ but his critics questioned his abilities , pointing out that despite funding mr @entity7 ’s leadership bid he served only briefly in an obscure front bench job and has never had a ministerial post			2
one serial rebel said : ‘ if i wanted to get rid of @entity7 , the last person i would back would be the kind of idiots who launch a leadership campaign in one of the prime minister ’s most successful weeks			2
’ another mp added : ‘ some people do n’t realise how loopy they look to everyone else			0
’ mr @entity1 would also have to contend with organised supporters of more senior figures			0
some senior female mps will seek to secure the leadership for mrs may , while mr @entity37 ’s lieutenants have been building support for him on the backbenches			2
@entity4 chairman @entity140 said he had sought assurances that mr @entity1 would not run			0
@entity97 ( pictured ) is a supporter of @entity1 where @entity7 rode to victory with the help of the modernisers in the ‘ @entity23 set ’ , @entity1 ’s team have taken to styling themselves ‘ the @entity9 set ’			1
the name is a nod to mr @entity1 ’s seat , where he lives in a lavish former monastery , but is somewhat misleading since the other members are not geographically close			0
they include @entity74 , the mp for the @entity157 , and @entity75 , the mp for @entity158 who has helped co-ordinate @entity46 rebellions against mr @entity7			2
another supporter , @entity97 – currently suspended from the @entity4 whip – is mp for @entity162			0
the mps meet in @entity164 , sometimes at mr @entity1 ’s £ 7.5million mansion near @entity166 which he shares with his second wife @entity167			2
one supporter said : ‘ it ’s like the @entity23 set			0
we ’re looking at what @entity7 and his crowd did before he became leader			0
’ but the @entity9 set lacks the heavy hitters who gathered around mr @entity7 , such as @entity37 and @entity177			1
the @entity9 set is a nod to mr @entity1 's seat where he lives in a former monastery and most of the @entity9 set have been removed from the front bench by mr @entity7 , or were never given a job			1
the ‘ organised group ’ of @entity190 fans claims to number eight mps , but one critic said : ‘ i ca n’t think of more than five			0
and most of them are nutters			0
’ allies of the largely obscure mr @entity1 point out that mr @entity7 was little known by the public before – but he and mr @entity37 were widely touted in @entity193 as the @entity194 of the @entity4 modernisers for five years before assuming the leadership of their party .			1

@entity1 , the multi-millionaire mp for @entity9 , has said he supports @entity7 ' for now '
armed camps of mps are now forming to support future leadership bids
