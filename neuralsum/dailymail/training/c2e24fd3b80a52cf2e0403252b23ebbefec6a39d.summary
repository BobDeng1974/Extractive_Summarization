the stunning ice caves of @entity3 's @entity2 glacier appear in a kaleidoscope of colours as the light and conditions change in these remarkable photographs by local guide @entity10			1
about 200 @entity13 tourists annually brave the network of caves in @entity17 's largest glacier mass found in the south of @entity3 where @entity10 runs tours for keen photographers throughout the winter , the only time visitors can go inside			1
the ice takes on the form of giant teeth or huge waves trapped in suspended animation in the maze of interconnected frozen chambers and they can be a luminous blue or near fluorescent oranges and reds when a fire is lit inside or when the sun outside is rising or setting			0
' normally we find caves in several different locations on the south side of @entity2			2
sometimes they are very special , sometimes not as special but become special in the right light and conditions			0
' @entity10 comes from a long line of @entity3 adventurers , with his grandfather @entity70 in the first group to climb @entity3 ’s highest peak , @entity73 , 1891 when he guided the @entity13 's @entity74 to the top			1
his father , @entity76 , packed in sheep farming to give bird watching and history tours in @entity80 in 1991			0
@entity10 then began taking tours of his own to the peak of @entity73 in 1994 and say his 275 ascents of the mountain is a record			2
he now runs the ice cave tours with his wife @entity88 and son @entity89 through their company @entity90 of @entity2 , formerly known as from @entity92			2
about 200 @entity13 tourists annually brave the network of caves in @entity17 's largest glacier mass in the south of @entity3 @entity10 says while it would seem the ice takes on the blue of the sky , it can in fact appear blue on cloudy day a fiery orange - red reflection illuminates the cave			1
' the low advent sun that makes this crazy red light when it shines through the ice			0
i 've only seen this this one time , ' @entity10 says			0
a man stands in a majestic tunnel of ice that resembles the kind of barrel wave surfers dream about dramatic shards and smooth surfaces feature in this part of the cave network that is ever - changing and slowly moving @entity10 captures a tourist taking in the remarkable scenery beneath the surface veteran tour guide @entity10 gets settled to camp in the cave with a sleeping bag and a fire to prepare food the rippling blue ocean or rock hard ice ? @entity10 captures a close up view of the ice cave 's beauty ' some caves we find are very stable and we can go in there in any weather , but others are less safe and we might not even go there at all , even if they are very beautiful			1
' some caves are only accessible in below zero conditions for example if there is water in the floor that needs to be frozen over to walk into the cave			0
' while some glacial caves are created by geothermal springs , @entity10 says the caves on the south side of @entity2 ' simply form because in the summer the surface of the big glaciers meld due to warm weather and sun and the water falls into thousunds of mullions ( sink holes ) and finally come out of the glacier tongue as a river			1
' he adds : ' when winter is cold enough we can enter many of those tunnels that formed the previous summer			0
when the sun is lower , the glacier does n’t meld much and the tunnels are dry			0
' a glimpse of the outside world from the cave as its roof shines the yellow of the sun @entity10 lights a fire alongside the steep wall of the network of caves in the @entity2 glacier , which covers eight per cent of @entity3 @entity10 says while some caves are very stable , others are inaccessible regardless of how beautiful they may be			1
