the brand , which launched in 2010 , was the result of a chance conversation between the two fashion lovers			0
' it all started with one of our girlie chats by the @entity58 about our dreams and aspirations , ' the two say on their website			0
' within minutes we knew the time was right for us to start a fashion label together , so later that night over a bottle of wine we sketched our favourite dresses and shared our passion for style icons of old			0
' we realised that with our combined enthusiasm , we could create something unique and new that we loved			0
' we decided to create a label that produced gracefully feminine and effortlessly wearable dresses that followed the curves of women ’s bodies			0
