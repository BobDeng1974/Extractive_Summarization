@entity1 head coach @entity0 has managed some of @entity4 's biggest clubs but never before has he had a group of players so dedicated that they asked him to train on their day off			1
the campaign may still be in its infancy but those predicting a season of woe at @entity12 's could not be further off the mark judging by early displays			1
saints enter this weekend 's match with @entity17 second in the @entity18 and looking for a sixth successive win in all competitions			1
@entity0 admits he has never experienced players turning down the offer of a day off @entity23 ( r ) scores a screamer to give @entity1 a 2 - 1 victory over @entity26 in the @entity27 the latest victory saw them return from @entity26 on tuesday as 2 - 1 victors in the @entity27 - a performance and result that saw @entity0 give his players wednesday off			1
there is nothing unusual about that , although the fact his squad instead asked to come to training is something he has not experienced in any of his previous managerial roles at clubs like @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			2
' the players showed a great ambition because we planned last wednesday as a day off after the tuesday and @entity52 said to me : ' @entity54 , we would like to come to train tomorrow ' , ' he said			2
' i said ' but you have a day off - i 've planned a lot of things with my wife ! ' but we changed it and we had a recovering session			0
' i never had that - a team , a squad say ' no day off ' and that means a lot for me , that means a lot about the ambition of the players			2
defender @entity52 ( c ) asked his manager if players could train the day after the @entity26 game ' we spoke to each other and said : ' okay , if you win against @entity73 then you get that day off for next week ' , and we hope to win on saturday			1
' such attitude and togetherness has impressed @entity0 , who himself was one of the world 's best players in his day			1
the former defender was key to @entity81 's @entity80 triumph in 1992 and knows reaching that competition with @entity1 is beyond them this term , despite their fine start			1
' it is n't realistic ' he said of a top - four finish			0
' i remember one of the questions in the last week of starting the season and that question was totally different and that 's football			0
' but you ca n't say anything about that because we 've played only five games in the @entity18 and at the end of the season are 38			0
' we know it 's a long season , it 's a tough season			0
@entity102 celebrates after scoring against @entity103 during @entity1 ' impressive start to the season ' okay , we know we have a very good start of the season , with all the changes we make from the beginning and , of course , after the win of last tuesday the expectations of the fans , of the press is much higher than it was before the first game			0
' but it will be more difficult and we have to realise that and to keep going with what we did until today			0
' few expect @entity1 to come off the rails against a @entity17 side whose away league matches this season have both ended in 4 - 0 defeats			1
a similar result would be particularly sweet for many @entity1 fans given the west @entity128 are managed by @entity130			2
@entity130 was in charge of @entity1 when they were relegated in 2005 @entity130 ( r ) will face his former club when @entity1 meet @entity17 in their next @entity18 match in 2005 , the 67 - year - old was in charge as @entity1 dropped out of the top - flight for the first time in 27 years before rejoining bitter rivals @entity139 just months later - something @entity0 was completely unaware of			1
' he is not [ a popular figure ] ? why ? i did n't know that , ' he said			0
' what i see now in the @entity18 , even in the away games , is a lot of respect of the crowd and that 's much different than we have in @entity150			0
' i think @entity130 is a name , it 's a successful manager and a lot of experience , but i 'm not the person to look to the history of the managers and the players			2
' in my opinion , he 's a manager who i respect and i think everybody has to respect			0

@entity0 admits being impressed by @entity1 stars ' attitude
@entity1 players asked to train after their 2 - 1 @entity27 win over @entity26 despite being given the day off
former @entity45 boss has *ruled* out a @entity80 finish though
@entity1 face @entity17 in their next @entity18 clash on saturday
@entity173 is *shocked* that @entity130 is not popular at @entity12 's
