dr @entity0 , chief executive of the troubled @entity1 , issued an apology after the incident became known paramedics have left bodies unattended at ambulance stations for hours at a time to avoid finishing their shifts late , a disturbing report has revealed			1
crews meant to transport bodies to hospital morgues have instead paid undertakers to do the job for them so they can go home			2
on other occasions they have handed over their vehicles , with a body on board , to workers on the next shift to make sure they could leave on time			2
the shocking lack of respect shown to the dead emerged in a serious incident review into the case of @entity27 by the @entity28 ambulance service			1
mr @entity27 , 32 , should have been taken to a hospital morgue in @entity31 after he collapsed and died in the street in september			1
instead – in an act branded ‘ disgusting ’ by patients ’ groups – his body was left next to bins at @entity39 ambulance station in @entity40 by paramedics about to finish their shift			1
@entity44 , of the @entity45 ’ @entity43 , said : ‘ i ’m saddened and disgusted at how paramedics feel they can treat somebody just because they ’re dead			0
‘ whatever happened to public service ? how would they like it if it was their own relative ? ’ the internal report revealed : mr @entity27 was found a short distance from his home in @entity40 in the early hours of september 24			1
an emergency call was placed at 5.13am and an ambulance crew arrived at 5.30am			0
police also attended but no ‘ obvious trauma ’ was found so they gave permission for the plumber ’s body to be moved			1
it was placed in a body bag , but instead of being taken to @entity64 in @entity31 , it was transported six miles to @entity39			0
the report said : ‘ that crew were due to finish at 6am but in an effort to prevent them being too late off shift , the local rapid response vehicle paramedic suggested that they transport the deceased patient to the local ambulance station to remove him from public gaze			1
the body of @entity27 was left on the floor next to bins for three hours at @entity78 after paramedics from @entity1 did n't want to work late - the service has apologised mr @entity27 was found dead near @entity82 fire station , where police spent three days investigating his death ‘ the police were asked to arrange for the undertaker to collect the patient from the station and convey him to the hospital mortuary			1
’ a police officer remained with the body at the ambulance station but when a new sergeant came on shift at 7.45am he informed the ambulance service that the force would not be arranging transport and they would have to take mr @entity27 to @entity31 ‘ as soon as possible ’			1
the report said there had not been enough time to investigate the ‘ scale ’ of the arrangement with the local undertaker or ‘ if this is isolated to one undertaker ’			0
a service spokesman admitted the practice may be more widespread , adding : ‘ we do n’t know how many [ times it has happened ]			0
’ investigators also found crews coming to the end of their shift had ‘ swapped with an on - coming crew , while en route to the mortuary … on five occasions ’			0
one paramedic has been removed from his role and is working elsewhere under supervision			0
a decision is yet to be made about what action to take with other members of staff involved			0
mr @entity27 ’s relatives declined to comment yesterday but a friend said : ‘ this report has reopened the wounds			1
’ the @entity1 has repeatedly been accused of poor performance - which may have contributed to patients ' deaths			0
a report earlier this year found that its response times were unacceptably slow			1
mr @entity27 's case is the latest embarrassment for @entity1 's £ 232,000 - a - year chief executive dr @entity0 , who in august was revealed to be claiming £ 18,400 a year on taxi rides as he juggles the post with running the @entity143 service			1
dr @entity0 made headlines earlier this year when it was revealed he is now earning £ 232,000 a year - £ 90,000 more than the prime minister - after landing himself a £ 50,000 pay rise for taking on @entity1 alongside his existing role as chief executive of @entity151			0
in 2011 @entity1 was branded the country 's worst after being fined £ 5million for responding to emergencies too slowly - the service was the only one in @entity154 which missed targets for reaching accident scenes on time			1
in april this year the scandal - hit ambulance service was criticised for spending nearly £ 250,000 on pr staff to defend its reputation			2
last year , the trust spent £ 5,000 a week on five members of staff in its pr department , whose job is to respond to criticism and promote the service 's image			2
in september a 90 - year - old woman who shattered her pelvis in a fall was forced to wait six hours for an ambulance to take her to hospital			2
@entity176 was found by a neighbour at 5.45pm on august 29 and guidelines stipulate an ambulance should have taken her to hospital within 90 minutes			2
but the widow , who said she feels she was treated like a ' dog ' , did not arrive at the @entity183 and @entity184 until after midnight			0
earlier this year , @entity186 figures revealed that the trust had been implicated in 155 ' serious incidents ' since april 2010			0
of those , 59 related to the unexpected or avoidable death of a patient - although the trust insisted that it was not responsible for the deaths			0
the @entity193 covers a population of 5.8 million in @entity195 , @entity40 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity183 and @entity198			2
@entity78 - where mr @entity27 's body was left for three hours as crews did n't want to work late the report is another blow for @entity28 service chief executive @entity0 , who has been accused of doing a part - time job because he also runs the @entity143 service			1
dr @entity0 is paid £ 232,000 a year , yet under the former ambulanceman , the @entity143 service has been fined £ 2.6 million for missing targets			0
and the @entity28 service reached just 73.6 per cent of ‘ @entity211 ’ calls – the most life - threatening – within eight minutes in the year to march 2014			2
health minister @entity212 has said : ‘ effectively , dr @entity0 is being paid two salaries at the same time , even though he ’s only doing half a job for each ambulance service			1
’ dr @entity0 declined to comment			0
@entity217 mp @entity216 said : ‘ it is unacceptable and disrespectful to treat those who have died in this way			0
action should be taken against those responsible			0
’ @entity223 , the @entity28 service ’s director of clinical quality , said : ‘ we apologise wholeheartedly to the family for the distress this incident has caused – it should never have happened			1

body of @entity27 found near his home in @entity82 , @entity40
paramedics left him on floor of ambulance station so they did n't work late
report found delay may have affected **post-mortem** *exmination* results
@entity242 have apologised to mr @entity27 's family
mr @entity27 ’s body was left for more than two hours , not one hour as *previously* thought ;
the lack of *refrigeration* may have caused problems with a **post-mortem** examination ;
there is evidence of at least one similar previous incident – and the service admits there may be more ;
none of the paramedics referred to in the report has been sacked over the incident .
