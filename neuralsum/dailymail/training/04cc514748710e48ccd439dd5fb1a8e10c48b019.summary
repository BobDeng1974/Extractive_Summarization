despite fast - flowing lava trickling down from the crater just 15 metres away , a cameraman has captured the dramatic aftermath of @entity5 's volcanic eruption			1
@entity6 , 61 , risked his life to get these stunning close - ups of molten lava flowing from the @entity11 volcano			1
a giant burning mass of molten remains can be seen smouldering in the foreground as the lava continues to spurt from the @entity18 eruption 's crater behind			2
' you feel very , very small in a moment like this in front of a 100m - high melted lava fountain , ' said @entity6			1
' i realised acutely how small and insignificant we are , compared to the awesome power of natural forces			0
the heat emanating from the lava is much more visible during the night			2
' standing close to the margin of the lava field , one realises the unbridled force of the eruption			1
' @entity38 - who along with his son @entity34 and wife @entity36 - has captured many eruptions on the island , added : ' the lava is flooding towards you over the endless black sand and is glowing in the dark			1
' you can hear a constant hissing sound from the crater			0
it is like you are watching the creation of the earth			1
and sometimes you think the earth is going to open up under your feet			2
' @entity6 travelled from the nearest civilisation to get the eruption , from a small farming village in @entity56 three to four hours away			1
' one sees almost nothing but black sand , and at times , you have to rely on small road markers , ' he said			0
' it 's like being on the moon			0
' too close for comfort ? the fearless cameraman ventured within 15 metres of molten lava to capture these apocalyptic scenes from the @entity5 eruption 's aftermath despite fast - flowing lava trickling down from the crater , @entity6 , 61 , risked his life to get the stunning close - ups the lava glows in the dark as it rolls along the black sand towards the cameraman and his equipment @entity6 travelled four hours from the nearest settlement to capture the photographs with his son @entity34 and wife @entity36 ready for your close up ? the photographer has captured volanic eruptions many times before and is seemingly unafraid of the phenomenon a giant burning mass of molten remains can be see smouldering in the foreground as the lava continues to spurt from the crater behind the set up : @entity6 aims his camera at the volcano still smouldering away to capture the stunning shots ' it 's like you 're watching the creation of the earth , ' says @entity6 of the incredible sight view from above : the volcano @entity11 first began violently spewing lava and molten ash in august setting up : ' the heat emanating from the lava is much more visible during the night , ' explains @entity6 , who set up his equipment specifically to capture it in the dark as @entity6 braved the heat metres from the volcano , a geologist and teacher trying to photograph the @entity112 by a lagoon in south east @entity5 90 kilometres away captured these equally stunning shots which he said reminded him of ' @entity114 '			1
in just eight degrees , by the lagoon @entity115 in south east @entity5 , @entity117 from @entity119 town in south west @entity5 , said : ' we were meant to be photographing the @entity112 using the lagoon and the ice blocks in the foreground but we got the red glow from the eruption of @entity11 instead			0
' the eruption on the north side of the @entity129 glacier started two weeks before , so we knew about it but we did not assume we would see the glow			0
' red sky at night : the clouds in the sky reflect the erupting volcano of @entity11			0
the glow is created by a pool of lava lying in the volcano 's crater ' i was born in @entity5 and i 'm 59 years old , so i have seen a lot of eruptions in my lifetime			2
but this was totally new for me , ' said photographer @entity117 only reflect : a lack of wind , clear sky and temperatures of over eight degrees celsius allowed @entity117 to capture the bright reflections the glow is created by a pool of lava lying in the volcano 's crater and reflecting in the sky above			1
and as it bounces back down onto the waters of a lagoon , pictured in the foreground , the red glow stretches to become a rippled red pillar			0
the noise and sights of the eruption were blocked by small intervening mountains and @entity167 's largest glacier - @entity129 - which stands at 1000 to 2000 metres high			1
yet the lack of wind , a clear sky and temperatures of over eight degrees celsius , allowed @entity117 to clearly see the bright reflections			0
the photographer said : ' as i was born in @entity5 and i 'm 59 - years - old , i have seen a lot of eruptions in my lifetime			2
but this was totally new for me			0
it was more like a scene from @entity114 - i have never seen a reflection like this from other eruptions			0

@entity6 , 61 , risked his life to get the close - ups by setting up his camera 15 metres away
standing in front of a 100m high melted lava fountain produced a *series* of dramatic shots
photographer said the experience was ' like watching the creation of the earth '
