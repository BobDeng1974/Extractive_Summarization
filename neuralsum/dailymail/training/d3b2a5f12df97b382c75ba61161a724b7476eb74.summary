by @entity0 @entity1 : @entity3 star @entity2 set to complete £ 37m move to @entity5 on friday after such a miserable season , @entity5 fans have been crying out for a hero			1
in @entity2 , they might just have one			2
with confidence at an all - time low after the @entity12 defeat , @entity2 ’s signing is a glimmer of hope at @entity15			1
he ’s a magician of a player , has a fantastic attitude and he can thread a pass through the eye of a needle			2
he ’s a match - winner , but make no mistake , he ’s not the answer to all of @entity5 ’s problems			2
his arrival is a statement of intent but it ’s just papering over the cracks at the moment			0
waving goodbye : @entity2 looks to be on his way from @entity3 to @entity5 needs more : it is a good start for @entity34 , but the signing is just papering over the cracks @entity5 need an overhaul to get back to the top and they are still short of five or six top - quality players			1
with the likes of @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 all potentially leaving in the summer , it will be a big rebuilding project			0
but signing @entity2 is a good start			1
when @entity46 joined , @entity5 had won nothing the previous year			1
he was the catalyst , the player who made the difference and fired them to the league title			0
@entity2 could have a similar impact and if he gets united into the top four , it will be just as big an achievement			2
the problem for @entity34 is getting his players fit , because a team sheet with @entity58 , @entity2 , @entity59 and @entity60 on it starts to look very dangerous			1
i ’ve always said lining up in the tunnel at @entity15 was nerve - racking because of the number of superstars they had			2
they miss that aura now but with those four they ’ll be able to hurt teams			0
dribbler : @entity2 has proved his quality at @entity3 , and now he can make @entity5 fearsome again link up : @entity46 and @entity59 have been crying out for a creative force behind them potential : @entity60 has burst onto the scene and could help @entity2 trophy after trophy : teams used to be scared visiting @entity5 , @entity34 needs to find a way to replicate this people say he ’s not a @entity5 player or does n’t fit their philosophy but what is their current philosophy ? good players adapt and @entity5 can be flexible to get the best out of their attacking players			1
they could easily go with a midfield diamond with @entity2 at the top of it behind @entity59 and @entity46 , or he could play in a wider role			1
as long as @entity34 restores his confidence he could play @entity2 anywhere across the front because he is expert at playing in between the lines			1
in football we have very short memories			0
all it takes is a bad six months and suddenly you ’re a bad player			0
that ’s just not true with @entity2			2
he played 64 games and scored 20 goals last season and was @entity3 ’s @entity106 , again			0
he has always been good enough for @entity3 , he was just never good enough for @entity107			0
failures : the current crop have suffered unacceptable cup defeats at home ... amongst others window of opportunity : @entity46 arrives for training and @entity5 will hope to have him back soon not looking clever : @entity116 arrives the day after the semi-final penalties defeat by @entity12 arrival : @entity43 , suspended for the @entity12 debacle , drives into the training ground a tough gig : @entity122 looks lees - than impressed as he arrives at @entity124 in the shadows : marquee summer signing @entity126 is recovering from injury coach in the car : @entity131 arrives for what surely will be a chastening day at training flops : @entity135 ( left ) and @entity136 both played in the semi-final loss @entity107 is the kind of manager who can make you feel a million dollars , but equally he can suck the life out of you with just a few words			1
that ’s what happened with @entity2 this season			0
clearly he did n’t fit the @entity107 mould and he looked totally drained			0
that ’s not to say @entity107 is wrong , it ’s just his opinion and if @entity3 win the title , his decision will have been entirely vindicated			0
but now @entity2 has a chance to play regular football again and he will want to impress			0
it ’s up to @entity34 to put an arm round him and get him back to his best , because an on - song @entity2 is the first step towards getting the fear factor back at @entity15			1
lacking confidence : @entity107 not fancying @entity2 does n't mean @entity3 did n't no @entity2 there : @entity2 trained alone in @entity3 's fitness centre and away from the first team on wednesday big decision : @entity3 boss @entity107 is happy to let @entity164 playmaker @entity2 join @entity5			1

@entity2 is a magician of a player but @entity5 need more
@entity34 needs to rebuild squad ... signing @entity2 is a good start
@entity171 linking up with @entity46 and @entity59 is *exciting*
the fear factor could be brought back to @entity15
