the second , called @entity12 : the making of a princess , will focus on his fairy tale romance with his now - wife , the @entity16 ' commoner ' @entity12 , who he met in a pub in @entity18 14 years ago			1
the first charts his younger years as a playboy in the 1990s			1

the couple are pictured here with two of their four children , @entity29 and @entity32 both projects are expected to air on television by the end of the year , with the first funded partially by the @entity1 government and the latter produced by @entity16 company @entity38			0
the royals have been bracing themselves for @entity8 's @entity7 for the last couple of months , with movie producers expected to lift the lid on the prince 's past as an eligible bachelor			2

he told @entity1 film magazine @entity72 : ' it 's a fictional film about the royal family built on facts , inspired by the international wave of biopics about living people , it can be a dangerous area , but that is also part of the motivation			2

' @entity12 from @entity89 first met @entity8 in the bar of @entity18 's @entity91 during the @entity92 the film by @entity38 called @entity12 : the making of a princess is less likely to contain any clangers that could embarrass the royal family , as it focuses on the romance between @entity8 and the now - @entity94 of @entity1 @entity12			1
the script details the hurdles that ' commoner ' @entity12 faced in adapting her normal and carefree life to that of a royal who is known globally for her great sense of style , much like @entity107 's @entity106			1

i did n't know he was the prince of @entity1			0
half an hour later someone came up to me and said , " do you know who these people are ? " ' prince @entity8 returned to his homeland after the games but made several visits back to @entity16 to visit @entity12 and the couple went on short trips around the continent together			0
but it was n't until april 2003 that @entity1 's @entity136 publicly acknowledged their relationship			0
