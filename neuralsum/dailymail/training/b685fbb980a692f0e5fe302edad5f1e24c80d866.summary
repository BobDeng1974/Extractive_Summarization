by @entity0 last updated at 11:46 pm on 4th january 2012 ' flirting ' : @entity1 warned police to watch out for hacks who might try to get them drunk to reveal information police officers have been warned they face the sack if they have ‘ improper ’ communications with journalists			1
a review into the relationship between @entity13 and the media has called for tighter controls on the release of information			1
it even recommends that officers should not drink alcohol with journalists because it ‘ loosens tongues ’			1
but it is feared that the rules will lead to less information reaching the public as officers are deterred from speaking out			2
the guidelines could also allow police to bypass questioning and the potentially critical glare of the media by briefing community groups instead			2
the report , by @entity32 , the former parliamentary commissioner for standards , was ordered by former met commissioner sir @entity33			2
it followed allegations that ‘ cosy relationships involving excessive hospitality between some senior officers and @entity42 journalists ’ had undermined the @entity37 ’s phone hacking inquiry			1
sir @entity33 later resigned following criticism of his decision to hire @entity47 executive @entity46 as a pr consultant			0
he had also accepted a £ 12,000 freebie at a luxury health spa promoted by mr @entity46 , who was arrested in july over alleged hacking			0
yesterday met commissioner @entity52 said there would be ‘ no more secret conversations ’			0
he issued a stark warning to officers that whistle - blowers who act ‘ improperly ’ by leaking stories for malicious , selfish purposes or who merely pass on gossip would face disciplinary action			1
ms @entity1 's report was commissioned by former @entity37 commissioner sir @entity33 , left , who subsequently resigned amid allegations about the force 's pr contract with former @entity68 executive @entity46 , right if leaks did not lead to criminal proceedings , ‘ robust ’ management action would be required , he said			2
officers could be banned from accepting lucrative work as media pundits soon after leaving @entity13			1
the report said such moves had damaged the @entity37			2
it criticised officers such as @entity79 , a former assistant commissioner who was responsible for the original phone hacking inquiry , who became a columnist for the @entity83 two months after leaving the force			0
the @entity83 is owned by @entity68 , the company at the centre of the phone hacking scandal			0
dame @entity1 said : ‘ the speed with which some former police officers take employment within the media is a cause for concern			1
‘ i am also concerned that former police officers , some of whom have been dismissed , take employment with private investigation firms and continue to obtain information from former colleagues			0
’ the report said there was a ‘ range of contact that is not permitted ’ and which , if unregulated , would continue to damage trust in the impartiality of the police			0
officers are advised to watch out for reporters ’ ‘ flirting ’ and ‘ late - night carousing ’ , which were described as ‘ long - standing media tactics to get you to spill the beans ’			1
the report also found that contact between the police and the media had ‘ not been transparent enough ’			1
under the guidelines , officers are to be told to brief community groups instead of mainstream media			2
dame @entity1 said officers should ‘ weigh up the risk ’ when speaking to the @entity121 and formalise meetings by making a note of every conversation , with those records open to a random audit			1
she said : ‘ there are lots of other channels they should be using , because lots of people do n’t hear about what the @entity37 is doing through the press			0
‘ they hear about it through community groups , through community and local papers and lots of new media			0
’ mr @entity52 said : ‘ there should be no more improper contact – that which is of a selfish , rather than a public interest			0
‘ anyone found to have improperly shared information will be subject to misconduct and / or criminal proceedings			0

new guide for @entity13 urges officers to keep a note of every conversation they have with journalists
report urges officers to ' watch out ' for ' late - night carousing ' and ' yet another *bottle* of wine at lunch - all media tactics to get you to spill the beans '
