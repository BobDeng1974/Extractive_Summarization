the lesbian ex-partner of a multi-millionaire property developer has launched a court battle seeking a larger share of her lover 's fortune - even through the wealthy tycoon died more than a year ago			2
businesswoman @entity7 told her civil partner @entity8 that her fortune had been reduced to £ 750,000 at the time their relationship fell apart			1
but after ms @entity7 died of a brain tumour in 2013 , ms @entity8 discovered that she was apparently worth around £ 6million thanks to her investment in @entity15 's gay village			1
ms @entity8 , 40 , now claims she was misled by her ex during their break - up , and says she is entitled to a payout much bigger than the £ 162,000 she accepted as part of a settlement			2
battle : @entity8 , left , claims she was misled over the wealth of her ex-partner @entity7 , right , who died in 2013 the case which reached the @entity27 this week is unique - not only is it believed to be the first lesbian ' divorce ' ever to be heard in the court , it is the first time a dead person has been retrospectively accused of hiding assets			1
the two women , both from @entity34 , were together for 19 years after starting a relationship in the early 1990s , the court was told			1
during this time ms @entity7 became a leading property developer in @entity15 's @entity39 district , as well as opening a bar in @entity41 , central @entity42			0
she built a massive fortune through her business empire , and was named on the @entity47 rich list for the @entity48 with an estimated value of £ 30million , the court heard			0
ms @entity7 and ms @entity8 entered into a civil partnership in 2008 , but they separated the next year and their legal partnership was dissolved in august 2010			1
court battle : ms @entity8 has taken the case to the @entity27 in a hearing at the @entity56 ms @entity8 applied for financial maintenance after the break - up , and was told that ms @entity7 's business had been seriously affected by the recession , leaving her with just £ 750,000 in assets			1
seeking a ' clean break ' , ms @entity8 accepted a settlement of £ 162,000 , to be paid in instalments			2
when ms @entity7 died of a brain tumour in september 2013 at the age of 55 , her ex-partner realised that she was in fact much wealthier than previously thought , the court was told			1
business accounts for the year ending 2010 showed that @entity73 , a property company wholly owned by ms @entity7 , had a net worth of £ 5.5million			1
ms @entity8 's lawyer @entity76 said : ' if ms @entity7 had made full disclosure , it is inconceivable that the court would have approved an award in such modest terms to a wife in such modest circumstances			2
' wealth : ms @entity7 helped to develop @entity15 's gay village centred around @entity39 , pictured last year , a county court judge denied ms @entity8 permission to re-open her claim against ms @entity7 's estate , but that decision was overturned by @entity91			2
' there was material to support the case that there was non-disclosure of potential significance to an ancillary relief claim , ' said the judge			0
' it was ms @entity7 's duty to make full and fair disclosure , not only so ms @entity8 could evaluate her claim and decide upon how to proceed with it , but also so the court could exercise its discretion			0
' ms @entity7 had denied that ms @entity8 's understanding of her financial position was correct			0
the judge must have proceeded on the basis that she had much more modest means than ms @entity8 thought			0
' she added : ' it is surely arguable that there is a public interest in not supporting those who mislead others , in particular the court			0
i am persuaded that the grounds of appeal , as drafted , have a real prospect of success			0
' pointing to the case 's unusual circumstance , @entity122 said : ' the complication of the death of ms @entity7 is significant			0
i 'm not aware of any similar case where the non-disclosure has been acted upon following death of the other party			0
' ms @entity76 said miss @entity8 's appeal was likely to be ' bitterly contested ' by the representatives of ms @entity7 's estate , which was inherited by her mother because she died without making a will .			1
