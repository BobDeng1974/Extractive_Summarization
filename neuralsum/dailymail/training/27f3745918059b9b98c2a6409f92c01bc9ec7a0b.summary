a key prosecution witness in the trial of a former @entity3 student accused of watching his roommate ’s intimate encounter via webcam testified monday that he texted her multiple times as she was being interviewed by police to make the webcam video broadcast seem like an accident			1
‘ i think that he thought we were going to get in trouble , so he wanted to make it seem like it was more of an accident , ’ @entity12 , 19 , told the court			1
both she and defendant @entity22 , who turned 20 today , viewed the web images of @entity26 ’s roommate , 18 - year - old @entity12			1
‘ did you tell them we did it on purpose ? what did you tell them when they asked why we turned it on ? i said we were just messing around with the camera , ’ @entity26 said in some of his messages , @entity53 reported			1
@entity40 responded saying that she told investigators ‘ everything ’ that happened the night of september 19 , 2010 when @entity26 set up a webcam in his and @entity69 ’s room after @entity69 asked to have the room for himself			1
@entity69 jumped to his death from the @entity72 days after that , as the rumours abounded that he was gay			0
@entity40 also testified monday that she agreed to keep it a secret because it was so shocking to see the images - but that it was n't under wraps for long			2
‘ first of all , it was shocking			0
we did n't expect to see that			0
and now that what we did , it was like we should n't have seen it , ’ @entity40 told the jurors			2
‘ we did n't want people to know what had happened			0
’ but within minutes , she testified , she and defendant @entity22 were online chatting with friends about seeing two men kissing			0
others knew : defense attorney @entity98 cross examined witness @entity99 , a friend of @entity26 's who played @entity100 with him and claimed was told during a practice , among other teammates , that he had set up the webcam within the hour , ms @entity40 said , she agreed to show a few seconds of the video stream to four other women who visited her dorm room			1
still , she said , @entity26 did not intend to humiliate his roommate			1
@entity26 faces 15 criminal counts , including invasion of privacy and bias intimidation			1
to convict him of bias intimidation - the most serious charge he faces - prosecutors would have to persuade jurors that mr @entity26 acted out of bias toward gays			1
@entity40 was charged initially but entered a program that will allow her to keep her record clean if she meets a list of conditions , including doing community service , working or attending school full - time			0
she also agreed to cooperate with authorities and testify truthfully in @entity26 's trial			1
she said she has completed about 250 of the 300 hours of community service required			0
there is one requirement that was changed for her			0
she was to go through a program on cyberbullying or dealing with people with ‘ alternative lifestyles			0
’ witness : @entity3 student @entity138 testified saying she saw seconds of the webcam 's stream of two men kissing which she says shocked her since no program like that was offered in @entity145 , she instead saw a psychologist			1
unlike other more casually dressed college students who have testified so far in the trial , ms @entity40 wore a black business suit			0
and unlike the others , she kept her voice audible even during the most uncomfortable moments			0
she said that she invited @entity26 , whom she had known since middle school , to her dorm room for a snack a few minutes after 9pm on september 19 , 2010			1
when @entity26 tried to go back , she said , mr @entity69 told him that he wanted the cramped dorm room to himself for a few hours			1
@entity158 's attendance : @entity12 's mother , @entity159 , attended the trial today ( center ) listening to a witness testify that her son had requested a room change days after his roommate set up the webcam charges : @entity145 prosecutors are seen discussing the case that charges @entity26 with invasion of privacy , bias intimidation and other crimes within a few minutes , she said , he used her computer to view live images from his webcam			1
it was then , she said , that she saw about two seconds of mr @entity69 and an older man kissing			2
even though she said they initially agreed not to talk about what they had seen , she asked @entity26 to tell a friend about it during an online chat that began at 9.20pm and within minutes , word got around the dorm			2
she said she agreed to turn the webcam back on at the request of a woman who was among a group dropped by her room			0
‘ it was the exact same image , except that they had taken their tops off , ’ she said			0
‘ as soon as they saw it , i turned it off			0
’ ms @entity40 was expected to be back on the witness stand for more cross-examination on tuesday			0
also monday , jurors heard from university official @entity201 that mr @entity69 requested a room change about 30 hours after the alleged spying - and a day before he killed himself			2
