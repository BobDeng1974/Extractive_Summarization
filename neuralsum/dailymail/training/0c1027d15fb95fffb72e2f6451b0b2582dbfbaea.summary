according to court papers ' cannibal cop ' @entity12 , was told by an online friend by the name of ' @entity17 ' that human flesh ' is n't quite like pork , but very meaty anyway ' and that he 'd previously eaten a ' black woman and a white child			1
' the disgraced @entity23 officer - who has claimed he has n't ever eaten anyone before - replied ' excellent ' , reveal records at the @entity27 federal court released today			1
prosecutors in the trial of @entity12 want the jury to hear how he openly discussed cannibalism and the taste of human flesh through online chat rooms @entity12 , 28 , is charged with plotting to kidnap , torture , cook and eat at least 100 women and prosecutors also want jurors in his trial to hear of this online exchange between ' @entity17 ' , who is based abroad and @entity12			1
' if we get someone			0
. and we finish the meat early , would you go for another ? ' wrote ' @entity17 '			0
i think we would have to give it time though , ' replies @entity12			2
' why ? go for a completely different type			0
i 'd love to eat another child , ' countered ' @entity17			2
' in addition to the gruesome messaging , court papers note that ' @entity17 ' wrote to @entity12 that ' i also love roasting whole pelvises , mind you only did with the little one so far			2
' prosecutors revealed the chilling messages in response to @entity12 's legal team and their attempts to bar introduction of evidence ' in which @entity17 appears to recount times in his past he has cannabilized children			2
' @entity12 and his estranged wife @entity66 , 28			2
it was @entity66 's discoveries on @entity12 's computer that led @entity71 agents to her husband @entity12 's defense team has said that ' @entity17 '' hyperbolic and twisted recanting of prior instances of cannibalization are either irrelevant , exceedingly prejudicial , or both , ' and are ' only unrelated claims of @entity17 ' repugnant prior acts			1
' mr. @entity12 never engages in the conversation on this subject with @entity17 other than to usher the conversation away from the matter and into sexual fantasies about which mr. @entity12 finds arousing -- all of which have to do with adults , ' public defenders @entity88 and @entity90 wrote			2
however , federal prosecutors have insisted in court that the exchanges are not ' unfairly prejudicial ' and are ' highly probabtive of @entity12 's state of mind and of the existence of an actual , and non-fantastical agreement between @entity12 and the co-conspirator to commit a kidnapping			1
' ' indeed , they are no more sensational , depraved and disturbing than the related portions of the conversations ( which @entity12 concedes are admissible ) about shoving a specific and identified woman into an oven , with her legs folded under her , or cooking her over an open fire , slowly , to prolong her suffering , ' prosecutors @entity99 and @entity101 wrote			1
prosecutors also made the point that @entity12 as a police officer , ' charged with knowing , and enforcing , the law ' , was ' voluntarily communicating with an individual who claimed to have murdered and eaten a child , and who desired to commit other murders with @entity12			1
' @entity12 who will go on trial next month is accused of scheming online with at least three people to adduct , rape , torture , cook and eat women he targeted using a police database			1

' my mouth was watering the whole time , ' @entity12 allegedly told a friend on an online forum after he had lunch in @entity151 with a former college pal			1
the disgraced @entity23 cop later fantasized about slow - cooking and eating the woman , assistant u.s. attorney @entity99 said in court last tuesday			1

@entity173 ’s lawyer has said her client never intended to harm anyone and made that clear to investigators with whom he cooperated for several months before his arrest			0
during tuesday ’s appeals arguments , defense attorney @entity222 said @entity12 was just like 40,000 other people who go online to ' engage in the most heinous depraved chats but they are imaginary			1
