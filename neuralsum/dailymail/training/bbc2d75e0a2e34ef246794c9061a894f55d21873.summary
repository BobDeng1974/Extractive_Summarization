drones are n't the obvious way to give diners a romantic treat but one restaurant is hoping a flying machine laden with mistletoe will do the trick - and bring festive bookings flooding in			1

' we wanted to see how we could make @entity38 get - together in our restaurants even more entertaining			2
' we offered guests the encouragement they need to make their move - particularly the one half of @entity12 adults who have never had a kiss under the mistletoe			2
' our mistletoe drones are the perfect way to do this			0
not only are they great fun for the entire restaurant , but they help people get a little closer at this romantic time of the year			0
' maybe we 'll have had our first mistletoe drone wedding by this time next year			1
' the drone weighed only 1kg and flew over dinners heads with a piece of mistletoe attached to the bottom of it the survey , which was conducted by @entity9 and spoke to more than 2000 people , also looked which professions are most likely to get involved in a romantic incident at a @entity38 party			1
63 per cent of those working in hospitality said they would kiss a colleague , with the property industry coming a close second at 62 percent and those in the media not far behind at 56 per cent			0
but if you do n't fancy kissing @entity104 from accounts this year you 're not alone			0

@entity112 superstar @entity111 , 53 , former footballer @entity113 , 39 , and actor @entity114 , 50 , all came up trumps			0
meanwhile , model @entity116 , 34 , actress @entity118 , 29 , and @entity119 , 31 , are the celebrities men want to kiss the most			0
