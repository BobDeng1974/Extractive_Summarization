with an all - day breakfast by @entity1 , a free personal shopper and the world ’s only @entity4 duty free shop , it is , surely , the poshest airport ­ terminal in the world			1
in fact , it ’s so grand that it will be opened by the @entity12 herself and wo n’t even have a number			1
it will have a name — although whoever came up with this one should be sent to the @entity18			2
as of june , when this £ 2.5 billion ­ monster is opened , @entity20 ’s new @entity19 will be officially renamed @entity22 — which sounds like a statement of ­ republican intent or a very bleak ­ medical prognosis			1
the re-opening of @entity27 at @entity28 next month will see it be renamed as @entity29 i certainly would n’t advise mentioning ‘ the @entity32 ’s terminal ’ anywhere near the @entity34			1
@entity35 will come the retort : ‘ no , she jolly well is n’t			2
’ certainly , as terminals go , it ’s very shiny and very smart			2
but for all the wavy roof design and @entity42 ’s biggest indoor ­ sculpture , not to mention a lot of pr nonsense about ‘ revolutionising the @entity45 ’ , it ’s not much of a change			2
you ’ll still end up in the same old queues to have your nail clippers confiscated by the same old jobsworths before walking half a mile to line up all over again at the gate			2
this week ’s chaotic scenes at several @entity42 airports — fisticuffs and four - hour queues at @entity58 — are a timely reminder that when the computers go down , the colour scheme could n’t matter less			2
if you ’ve lost your luggage , you ’re unlikely to be impressed that the desk attendants have been rebranded as @entity64 ’ ( they really have )			2
i doubt this place will ever see quite such a good - natured band of punters as the 3,000 passengers i join for the first big rehearsal this week			1
after that famously inept opening of @entity20 ’s @entity74 in 2008 , the airport management are taking no chances this time around			1
the new terminal will include a @entity77 and the first duty free @entity4 the builders actually finished ­ construction work last november in order to leave a clear six months for fine - tuning everything			1
this week ’s epic play - acting exercise is the first attempt at an ordinary day			2
with up to 20 million passengers on 23 ­ airlines ( including @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 ) expected through this building every year , there could be 3,000 people ­ coming through here each hour			1
that is ­ double the number using the old @entity19 before it was knocked down in 2009 ( since when its tenant airlines have been lodging in other terminals )			1
there was , interestingly , no problem rounding up this number of volunteers , in exchange for a packed lunch and a sneak preview			1
local newspaper ads have helped to recruit 14,000 volunteers — more than at the 2012 @entity110 opening ceremony — for the entire test programme			1
‘ it ’s a nice day out , and i remember @entity20 in the days when passengers waited inside tents , ’ says retired airport worker @entity112 , from @entity113			1
she and her husband @entity117 , a retired @entity118 navigator , are here to board an imaginary flight to @entity121			2
the new sculpture within the terminal is called the ' @entity124 '			1
it was designed by @entity42 artist @entity126 ‘ @entity129 , ‘ they ’ve knocked 30 years off my age ! ’ every single volunteer has been handed an individual script on arrival , complete with name , age , nationality , boarding pass and replica passport			2
some are allocated an oversize cabin bag to test the reactions of staff at the gate			1
others are told to dawdle in @entity144 and hold up everyone else			2
retired book distributor @entity146 is rather sorry not to be his new alter ego			0
he is playing a ­ youthful @entity149 called @entity150 with a @entity89 ticket to @entity152			0
@entity153 and @entity154 , from @entity155 , @entity156 , are less thrilled			0
not only have they been recast as a male couple from @entity159 , but @entity153 has been given a first class seat to ­ @entity161 while @entity154 has been plonked in @entity162			0
the first thing we all encounter on turning up is a 256 - ft , 77 - ton ­ aluminium - plated creation called @entity124 , which hangs over the covered walkway at the front of the terminal			1
designed by the artist @entity126 , it replicates the exact path of a stunt plane swooping through the terminal			1
the ' @entity124 ' artwork is suspended 18 meters above the ground , weighs 77 tonnes and is 78 meters in length the £ 2.5 million result might best be described as a cross between a drill bit and a piece of pasta , but it is a clever concept , well - executed			0
many people stop to take its photograph			0
‘ we wanted something which reflects @entity42 as a world centre of the arts and of engineering , ’ explains @entity20 ’s development director , @entity186			1
a @entity192 - educated classicist , he explains that the new terminal is part of a 40 - year plan to transform @entity20 from a hotch - potch of five ill - fitting terminals to a sleeker airport with two mega- ­ terminals — this one and @entity74			1
each has a main building linked to a colossal satellite annexe by @entity204			0
on its own , the new ‘ royal ’ terminal is already bigger than @entity207			1
if @entity20 ’s @entity209 owners , @entity210 , get permission for the third runway which they ­ desperately want — and which half of @entity215 does not — then these two giants will have to grow even bigger			1
the much - trumpeted ‘ revolutionary ’ check - in is about as radical as @entity217 but the security hall is unusually big and bright			0
one ­ volunteer , who works at the airport , tells me that she is dismayed by the lack of privacy			0
‘ i have been asked to take off ­ several layers of clothing with a queue of men right behind me , and there are no cubicles , ’ she says			0
‘ people from some @entity232 countries will be appalled			0
’ a construction worker puts the finishing touches to the new terminal which is due to open on june 23 once inside , there are some exotic additions to the usual spread of cheap fags , booze and scent			1
@entity243 ’s perfectionists ’ café will feature liquid nitrogen ice cream and staff will be trained to grind all the burgers along the grain of the meat for optimum juiciness			0
@entity251 ? @entity252 ’s ? ­ forget it			0
the nearest thing to fast food will be a @entity257 ’s deli , and there are no less than two ­ @entity260 stores — one for fine china and fancy tea , the other ­ selling only watches			0
‘ we had five bidders for every ­ outlet and we want to showcase the best of @entity42 , ’ mr @entity186 says.in the atrium , things have turned even more surreal			0
a compere is leading 1,000 volunteers in a formation disco dance to the 1990 hit altogether now for a corporate video			1
i follow a party heading for an @entity275 flight to @entity276			0
it involves going down @entity42 ’s second - longest escalator , along three travelators and up a further pair of escalators			0
‘ i have to say it ’s a long way , ’ sighs @entity282 from @entity283 , who has become a 30 - year - old @entity284 called @entity285 for the purposes of this journey			1
the check - in desks at the airport , which were put to the test during a volunteer exercise no sooner has she made it all the way to the plane than all the outbound ‘ passengers ’ become inbound ones			1
all are handed a new identity and a new script , and are redirected into the arrivals stream			0
@entity282 morphs into a 36 - year - old @entity303 called @entity304 who has just arrived from @entity306			2
half an hour and a long walk later , i meet her again at baggage reclaim where she is supposed to pick up a suitcase			0
except it ’s not there			0
‘ i ’ve lost all my luggage ! ’ she laughs , and then remembers the point of all this			0
‘ i suppose i ’d better try to be angry			0
’ the refurbished @entity27 took five years to develop and build			0
the terminal is bigger than @entity207 alone @entity20 ’s managers are ­ praying that all this role play will pay dividends when their swanky new glass house opens for ­ business in june			1
my one reservation is that it may be a little too upmarket			0
it is certainly impressive , although some of its customers may find it a little elitist for passengers on some of this terminal ’s resident airlines			1
how many of those flying on , say , @entity333 will want a personal shopper or a little something from @entity336 ? and they really must do something about the name			0
why not the queen elizabeth ii terminal ? then , like @entity343 ’s @entity342 , we can all abbreviate it to ‘ @entity344 ’			2
and it wo n’t annoy the @entity34 either .			0

@entity20 *'s* new @entity19 will be officially opened by the @entity32 in june
will be renamed the @entity29 when it opens
terminal is bigger than whole of @entity207
up to *20million* passengers on 23 airlines are expected each year
14,000 volunteers were recruited to test out the new *facilities*
