by @entity0 published : 03:47 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 11:21 est , 10 september 2012 medals and world records may be the goal for all athletes , but a @entity6 sprinter has reminded the world that sometimes just finishing the race is a courageous achievement			0
@entity10 provided the @entity11 with one of its most poignant moments when after injuring himself during the men 's @entity16 final he got up and hobbled over the finish line			1
the runner was in the lead when he pulled up with a searing pain in his leg mid-way down the track and had to look on helplessly as his rivals raced away			0
demonstrating the courage and determination of a true paralympian he got up and limped slowly towards the finish			0
he eventually crossed the line in 1.30.79 while @entity39 of @entity40 won the @entity29 race in 11.05 seconds			0
the devastated athlete then sank to the ground and broke down in tears as the crowd of 80,000 cheered on his herculean effort			0
his desire to finish evoked memories of @entity52 400m runner @entity51 's determination to complete the final in @entity54 after he pulled a hamstring after just 150m			2
wiping tears from his eyes the @entity6 sprinter rises from the floor to courageously hobble on to the finish line the devastated athlete collapses to the floor on the track as his competitors race away from him			1
he eventually crossed the line in 1.30.79 while @entity39 of @entity40 won the @entity29 race in 11.05 seconds finally @entity10 is helped into a wheelchair by staff at the @entity67 before proud teammates drape the @entity6 flag around him @entity51 's will to cross the line after his father had fought past over-zealous officials to help him , is perhaps the most memorable moment of the @entity75 in 1992			1
earlier this summer in the @entity77 110m hurdler @entity76 , the poster boy of the @entity40 team , had given the @entity79 its own enduring image after he collided with the first hurdle in a qualifying heat only to carry on and finish the race			2
the injury agony was a sad echo of four years ago when @entity76 , who won gold in @entity87 in 2004 , was denied the opportunity to repeat the feat in his home games in @entity91 four years later			0
@entity51 is helped by his father in @entity54 after tearing a hamstring in the final of the 400m in what became one of the most enduring images of the @entity79 in the film @entity101 , based on a true story , the @entity100 bobsleigh team came from nowhere to compete at the @entity104 in @entity105 in 1988			1
for the first half of the final day 's race it looked as though they would break the world bobsled speed record , but unfortunately their sled , due to one of the blades falling off , flipped on its side coming out of a turn towards the end of their run , leaving them metres short of the finish line			1
however , the team lifts the sled over their shoulders and walks across the finish to rousing applause from spectators			2
the team , at the end , feels accomplished enough to return in four years to the next winter olympics			0
a brief epilogue states they returned to @entity100 as heroes and at the @entity104 four years later , they were treated as equals			1
in the same games @entity134 made the headlines as a gallant loser who overcame a series of injuries to take part in the ski jump despite having no chance of coming anywhere but last			0
to the sounds of cheers the @entity100 bobsleigh team carry their sled across the finish line in the film @entity101 , based on the story of the 1988 @entity104 team video : @entity10 collapses in the @entity154 final , but gets up to hobble over the finish line video : @entity51 pulls up in the final of the 400m at the @entity75 in 1992 , but is helped across the finish line by his father			1

@entity10 gets up to finish 100m final after collapsing with leg injury
courageous effort is *reminiscent* of @entity100 bobsleigh team carrying their broken sled over the finish line in 1988 @entity104
