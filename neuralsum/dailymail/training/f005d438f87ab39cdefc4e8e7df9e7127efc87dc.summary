by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 4 december 2013 with the familiar winding streets replaced with a sea of concrete , glass - bottomed canals and imposing skyscrapers this is how @entity7 might have looked if ambitious architects had got their way			1
the strange skyline , could be compared with a 1960s science fiction film , shows what the capital might have become , were it not for strict planning legislation and worried campaigners			1
using the latest digital technology including maps and models , artists have created these alternative views of the city for the exhibition almost lost : @entity7 's buildings loved and @entity24 , which opens today			1
alternative : digital technology has been used to show how @entity27 would have looked today had a 1954 proposal to transform the area into a giant conservatory topped with 24 - storey tower blocks had gone ahead skyline : this image created for a new @entity35 exhibition shows how the proposed @entity27 towers would have been visible from @entity37 depicting the worst nightmare of many a @entity40 , the images reveal some of the most bizarre and brilliant development projects pitched for the city over the decades			1
the images provide a glimpse of what the city might have looked like if @entity47 concrete - based designs , popular between the 1950s and 1970s , had been granted planning permission			1
among the most shocking is a 1954 scheme to replace @entity27 with a giant conservatory topped with 24 - storey tower blocks , the district 's maze of busy streets and alleyways swapped for landscaped gardens and glass - bottomed canals			1
in place of the famous @entity60 and @entity61 , visitors could have enjoyed a game of tennis on purpose - built courts , while famous old theatres would have made way for modern concert halls			0
the proposal , dreamed up by @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , was published in architect and @entity73 although it never made it past the initial conceptual phase			0
@entity76 : had a 1968 draft plan to redevelop @entity78 gone ahead only @entity79 would have remained			1
the rest of the historic buildings would have been replaced with concrete structures unfamiliar : designers behind this 1962 proposal for @entity85 thought it would improve the social , commercial and tourist values of the area many of the designs were attempting to re-work the city 's landscape after many streets and landmarks were decimated by bombs during the @entity97			1
the way the city was used also changed after the conflict , with many people leaving @entity7 for the suburbs			0
city planners and designers were also keen to use the latest new materials available , and forms of architecture such as high - rise buildings			0
@entity109 , who curated the show as founder of @entity113 charitable trust , told @entity114 : ' @entity116 talks about the vibrant area of @entity27 , but he does n’t connect			1
' it has taken us time to connect the actual retention of that character and how it connects to people , and buildings and layers of history			0
you ca n’t just knock something down and retain the character			0
' changing places : an aerial view of the proposed @entity131 , which sits alongside the @entity132			0
@entity133 can also be seen in this image , at the far end of the lake reality : @entity131 , as it is today			0
all of the images are on display as part of exhibition almost lost : @entity7 's buildings loved and loathed a decade later sir @entity143 , designer of the @entity144 , proposed a plan to ' replan ' @entity146 by demolishing virtually all the @entity148 and @entity149 buildings around @entity150 , including the @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153			1
sir @entity143 's scheme also proposed the creation of a new riverside square to the left of @entity159 with raised public restaurants facing the river			2
elevated roads ran between this and the @entity164 with an underpass running beneath a raised river terrace in front of @entity168			0
the aim was to take separate traffic from pedestrains and address a 175 % rise in traffic flow since 1945 and anticipated doubling by 1977			0
the exhibition also highlights a digital vision of how @entity78 might have looked had a 1968 development plan gone ahead			1
under the controversial proposal much of the south - western corner of @entity78 would have been lost to concrete terracing , and apart from @entity180 , no other buildings in the area would have been retained			1
the local community rallied against plans to demolish vast parts of the area led , somewhat intriguingly , by one of the planners who had worked on the original demolition proposals			0
new corridors of power : in 1964 sire @entity143 , designer of the @entity144 , wanted to ' replan ' @entity146 by demolishing virtually all the @entity148 and @entity149 buildings around @entity150 alongside the new digital aspect , the exhibition reveals that without the actions of thousands of individuals and organisations who campaigned to save the threatened places , recorded those that were lost and helped drive through protective legislation , much more of the city we know today would be lost or irreparably altered			1
alternative images of @entity204 , @entity85 , @entity37 , @entity131 and @entity205 can also be seen in the @entity35 exhibition at @entity207 at @entity208 , which runs until february			1
the exhibition also features an animated map of all buildings , scheduled monuments , conservation areas , registered parks , gardens and battlefields protected by the @entity217			2
a model of 1840 ’s @entity219 allows visitors to explore the area ’s development over the decades using ‘ @entity227 ’ on @entity223 which are passed over the model and display digital maps of the place as it was and as it is now			2
dr @entity228 , chief executive of @entity35 , said : ' almost @entity229 tells the story of how lucky we have been			2
' thanks to the campaigning efforts of our predecessors we still have a beautiful city to enjoy			0
' while we do n’t face the wholesale destruction of the 1960s and 70s we still face problems today and the sort of technology we demonstrate in the exhibition is part of the modern armoury of conservation			0
' brutal : @entity245 in @entity7 is one of the city 's many examples of brutalist architecture spawned from the modernist architectural movement , @entity250 is a style of architecture defined by concrete fortress - like buildings which flourished between the 1950s and mid- 1970s			1
brutalist architecture is loved and hated in equal measure , with plans to demolish the monolith structures often confronted with campaigns to save them			0
examples of the typically linear style include @entity7 's @entity263 , which houses the @entity264 , and the @entity265 listed @entity245 at the bottom of @entity267			2
initially the style , which often features an ' unfinished concrete ' look was used for government buildings , low - rent housing and shopping centres to create functional structures at a low cost , but eventually designers adopted the look for other uses including arts centres and libraries			2
critics of the style find it unappealing due to its ' cold ' appearance , and many of the buildings have become symbols of urban decay , coated in graffiti			0
despite this , @entity47 is appreciated by others , with many buildings having received @entity265 status			2
@entity295 architects @entity293 and @entity296 were believed to have coined the term in 1953 , from the @entity299 béton brut , or ' raw concrete ' , although @entity302 architect @entity301 clained he used the term in a conversation in 1950			2
the term became more widely used in 1966 when @entity307 architectural critic @entity306 used it in the title of his book , @entity250 : @entity311 ?			0
