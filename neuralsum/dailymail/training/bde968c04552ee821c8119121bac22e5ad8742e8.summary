by @entity0 stress triggers a person 's compulsion to comfort eat , a new study at the @entity6 in the @entity7 has found feeling stressed encourages people to comfort eating , a new study has revealed			1
hormones activated when a person feels anxious or worried have been discovered in taste cells , which identify sweet , savoury and bitter flavours			1
the findings could explain why many people dip their hand into the biscuit tin or raid the fridge when they come under pressure			0
researcher dr @entity21 , a chemical ecologist , said : ' sweet taste could be particularly affected by stress			0
' our results may provide a molecular mechanism to help explain why some people eat more sugary foods when they are experiencing intense stress			1
' he said he believes the hormones glucocorticoids act directly on taste receptor cells when a person is stressed , affecting how they respond to sugars and certain other foods			1
glucocorticoids affect the body by activating specialised receptors inside cells			0
knowing stress can have major effects on metabolism and diet experiments on mice showed their tongues contained receptors for them			0
the highest concentrations were found in those sensitive to sweet and savoury taste , reports the journal @entity52			0
the study showed stressed mice had 77 per cent more hormone receptors in the nucleus of taste cells than those that were more relaxed			2
it suggests the perception of sweet food - which is known to be altered by stress - could be specifically affected by the secretion of glucocorticoids and subsequent activation of their receptors in the tongue			0
dr @entity21 , of @entity6 in the @entity7 , said : ' taste provides one of our initial evaluations of potential foods			2
' if this sense can be directly affected by stress - related hormonal changes our food interaction will likewise be altered			0
' he said although stress is known to affect intake of salty foods the hormone receptors were not found in cells thought to be responsible for detecting this taste - or sour			1
researchers noted a person experiencing anxiety or worry were particularly likely to crave sugary foods one explanation is stress could influence salt taste processing in the brain			1
the researchers say the implications of their findings extend beyond the oral taste system because taste receptors are found throughout the body			1
study co-author dr @entity99 , a molecular neurobiologist , said : ' taste receptors in the gut and pancreas might also be influenced by stress - potentially impacting metabolism of sugars and other nutrients and affecting appetite			2
' about three - in - four people in the @entity108 are now overweight or obese - with comfort eating identified as one of the causes			0
a study of 500 schoolchildren in @entity114 showed those with high levels of the stress hormone cortisol and who turned to food gained body fat .			2

study carried out in @entity7 found feelings of anxiety or worry stimulated a person 's desire to comfort eat
researchers noted a craving for sugary foods , in particular
findings show stress hormones trigger taste receptor cells in the body
