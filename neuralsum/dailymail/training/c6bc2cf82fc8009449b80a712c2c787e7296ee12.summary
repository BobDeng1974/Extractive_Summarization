paramedics say their gear is so inadequate if they treated a suspected @entity5 case tomorrow , they would n't be able to go home for fear of infecting their families			1
a source at @entity17 's @entity16 in @entity17 's @entity18 says medical authorities covered up @entity3 's first @entity5 scare on august 10 , when a man who had recently flown in from @entity22 was kept in the emergency ward car park for four hours while authorities argued over where he would be treated			1
inadequate : despite assurances by @entity3 health authorities that the regular protective gear worn by paramedics ( pictured ) is sufficient to prevent ' contact and droplet ' contamination in @entity5 cases , many health care workers are fearful and are making their own " @entity5 suits ' to wear at work homemade : the white jumpsuit and face visor are not provided to ambulance officers and some other health care workers in @entity3 who are having to scrounge around for gear to keep them safe from @entity5 infection			1
the real thing : a worker in a full hazmat suit removes material while cleaning an apartment of a @entity47 health care worker			0

a hospital worker , who spoke to @entity87 on condition of anonymity , that the case of the @entity22 man - who eventually tested positive for malaria was handled so badly ' that ambulance officers were sent off with potentially @entity5 infected gear , @entity16 and royal @entity95 hospitals argued over who would take him and there was no follow up about the @entity5 issue with the people who handled him '			1
the @entity22 man ' ticked all the boxes ' of the @entity105 ebola virus disease patient risk assessment when he was taken to @entity16			1
@entity107 isolation : this is one of the two designated @entity109 at @entity110 , the only hospital in @entity57 which can test for the deadly virus			0
some health workers do n't believe there are enough beds for potential @entity5 outbreak , although health authorities insist any hospital can take a suspected victim well suited : the @entity120 's station at @entity121 in @entity17 ( pictured ) where paramedics say officers have hazmat suits , the only gear adequate with which to handle suspected @entity5 sufferers flying in from @entity128 completely covered : health workers from @entity131 's @entity130 at the @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity131 , wear the right gear as they take part in an exercise to test @entity131 's readiness for an @entity5 outbreak special training : @entity110 staff including intensive care unit nursing manager @entity141 ( pictured ) have undergone training for how to deal with an @entity143 , but ambulance workers feel they have been left out and are at risk , while staff at an other major @entity17 hospital also feel exposed to danger ' as it turned out , he did n't have @entity5 , ' the source said , ' but if he had and he 'd vomited or secreted some fluid the ambos would have done for			1

' nothing has been communicated to us , so if a suspected @entity5 case turned up tomorrow and i had to deal with it , i 'm not going to go home			1
i could n't take the risk of infecting my family			0
' one worker told @entity87 she had read in the media that the ambulance service had special vehicles to deal with an @entity5 outbreak , but that ' we 've been told nothing , we have n't been given any proper gear , it 's scary '			2
four hour agony : an ambulance in the emergency car park at @entity185 hospital ( pictured ) in @entity17 's eastern suburbs , where a @entity22 man waited for four hours in august , while doctors argued where the potential @entity5 suspect should be treated border security : health care workers have suggested field hospitals be set up at all major airports such as @entity195 in @entity17 ( pictured ) to isolate planeloads should a passenger develop @entity5 symptoms while en route to @entity3 from overseas @entity87 obtained a set of the ordinary @entity159 gear worn by ambulance officers , and the special white suit and perspex face visor and breathing mask some officers are kitting themselves up with			1

' if a person flying to @entity3 developed symptoms on board tomorrow and a whole planeload of people had to be isolated where would they go ? ' the health professional said			2
no chance : frontline health care workers in @entity17 say they are in no way adequately kitted out to deal with @entity5 victims like this @entity228 worker ( pictured ) at @entity230 's @entity229 ' @entity110 has two isolation beds and we have been told that is who will be taking @entity5 cases			2
' surely the quarantine needs to be contained as swiftly as possible			0
so why is n't the @entity238 or @entity239 government setting up field hospitals or isolation wards at the major airports ?

' there is a level of anxiety because it is a disease with high mortality , but it can be treated			0
' staff have undergone training and we need to be super sure the staff know what 's involved and what the risks are			0
' if a patient developed symptoms on a flight , unless that patient was copiously vomiting , the rest of the people on te plane would be absolutely minimal risk , although they would be anxious			0
' the other passengers would be reassured and asked to report any illness developing			0
' if there had been significant exposure they would be asked to place themselves in voluntary isolation , take their temperature twice a day and stay in very close contact			0

' dr @entity70 told @entity87 the @entity22 man who was taken to @entity185 hospital in august ' did not require testing for @entity5 as he did not meet the case definition '			1
how it 's done : aid workers and doctors transfer @entity228 priest , @entity302 , who was infected with @entity5 while working in @entity303 protective equipment : one of @entity110 's two ultra isolation rooms ( pictured ) is stacked with equipment for nurses and doctors to treat @entity5 patients , but some health workers say it is not enough if there is a severe outbreak she said , ' all clinical staff assessing the patient , including paramedics , had the correct @entity159 '			1
