by @entity0 passengers on @entity4 @entity3 flights will soon be able to keep on top of their emails , check @entity7 and stream films thanks to the introduction of high - speed in - flight broadband the airline hopes the partnership with satellite firm @entity13 will help it push ahead of rivals with the lure of super-fast and reliable internet across @entity4 airspace			1
it is thought the service could begin on domestic @entity22 routes within three years before being rolled out across @entity4 , but how much it will cost has not yet been announced			1
from 2016 @entity4 @entity3 flights will be kitted with high - speed internet provided by @entity27 - based satellite firm @entity13			1
the company will be launching a satellite in 2016 to provide the service , which is expected to bridge the gap between airborne @entity32 in the @entity22 and the @entity33 ( stock image shown ) a similar service in the @entity33 , called @entity37 , costs £ 3 ( $ 5 ) per hour or just under £ 10 ( $ 17 ) for a card with 24 hours loaded onto it			1
following the mysterious disappearance of @entity41 flight mh370 in march , @entity13 announced last month it is going to track flights free of charge to prevent such a disaster happening again			1
a total of 11,000 commercial passenger planes will be monitored and followed by the satellite firm , which helped reveal the last position of @entity40 in march			0
in addition , the firm will also provide a ‘ position reporting ’ tool in case flights veer off track , and a so - called ‘ black box in the cloud ’ to track real - time data remotely			0
this remote black box is triggered automatically if the plane deviates off course , or communication is lost , and also sends historic recordings to a team of experts			0
@entity13 ’s service additionally streams cockpit voice recordings			2
this service is being offered to planes which are already equipped with an @entity13 satellite connection , which the firm claims is ‘ virtually 100 per cent of the world ’s long haul commercial fleet ’			2
@entity4 lags far behind the @entity33 where @entity32 is already widely available to air travellers			0
but @entity13 plans to spend up to £ 270 million ( $ 450 million ) to bring @entity4 up to speed with passengers across the @entity75			2
about half of the money will be spent on launching a new satellite called @entity79 , to beam @entity32 down to planes in the air			0
it will share the cost with @entity86 - @entity85 space group @entity84 and expects the satellite to be ready for launching into orbit by 2016			2
@entity13 also plans to build a network of 300 ground stations across @entity4 ’s 28 countries over the next six years , using the same @entity93 broadband technology as the latest smartphones do			2
it said the @entity93 ground network meant on - board @entity32 could be as fast , reliable and cheap as the internet people use at home , for the first time in @entity4			1
@entity3 will test the service on domestic routes at first , before rolling it out across @entity4 , where it operates 600 flight per day on about 130 planes			1
it already offers a limited internet and text message service on its transatlantic business class - only @entity107 to @entity109 @entity108 service			0
and the airline last year became the first in the @entity22 to allow passengers to use electronic devices during take - off and landing , after @entity4 rules were relaxed			0
@entity3 will test the service on domestic routes at first , before rolling it out across @entity4 , where it operates 600 flights per day on about 130 planes			1
it already offers a limited internet and text message service on its transatlantic business class - only @entity107 to @entity109 @entity108 service @entity125 , head of product and service at @entity3 , said the airline could soon be ‘ leading @entity4 in a new era of broadband in the air ’			1
conservative mp @entity132 , minister for universities and science , welcomed the partnership between two leading @entity22 firms			0
‘ today ’s announcement is an important investment in new infrastructure that will promote productivity and growth in the @entity22 and across @entity4 , ' he said			0
meanwhile , @entity13 boss @entity141 said he expects in - flight @entity32 to be a ‘ multi-billion dollar ’ industry by 2020			1
he hopes to do deals with other @entity4 airlines , with @entity3 set to be the first to get its hands on @entity32 in mid-air			2
‘ @entity13 will deliver high - speed mobile broadband to the seat back or to the passengers ’ own mobile device , whether that ’s a laptop or a phone or a pad throughout @entity4 , ’ he said			1
‘ this transforms the potential for connectivity for aircraft flying around @entity4			0
’ pricing would be decided by the airlines , @entity141 said , and passengers could be charged by capacity or per flight , or monthly for frequent flyers			0
‘ it ’s going to be at a rate that is commensurate with terrestrial services , ’ he said .			0

fast internet will be soon be available on @entity4 @entity3 flights
the service will be provided by @entity27 - based satellite operator @entity13
a dedicated satellite is expected to be launched at the end of 2016
in - flight internet via satellite has been available for more than a decade
but it has *previously* been *criticised* for being *expensive* and slow
@entity13 and @entity3 have not revealed how much the in - flight service will cost
