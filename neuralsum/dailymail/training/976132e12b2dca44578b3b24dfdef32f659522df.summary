by @entity0 @entity1 : 14:13 est , 15 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:49 est , 15 december 2013 as they gaze up at us , our pet dogs often seem to know just what we ’re thinking			0
and their position as man ’s best friend is getting stronger all the time – because their ability to understand and predict human behaviour is actually growing with each generation , according to animal psychologists			1
a study from the @entity16 in @entity17 shows that a dog ’s ability to understand humans is innate and does not depend on training			1
animal psychologists say dogs are evolving their ability to understand and predict human behaviour it is a result of breeding and genetic selection , so it will only get more advanced in the future			1
scientists observed how 24 dogs , ranging from the highly trained to the totally untrained , reacted to people ’s unspoken commands , such as pointing at a location for the dog to move to			1
they found the dogs ’ training levels made no difference to their responsiveness			2
dr @entity39 , who led the study published in the journal @entity41 , said : ‘ we found that training levels did n’t make any difference - no matter how well trained they were , it did not make their ability to pick up cues better or worse			1
‘ what made the difference was whether they were familiar with the human who was giving the cues			0
‘ as they get to know particular humans , they pay more attention to them and this may mean they can read and even predict human behaviour with more efficiency as familiarity grows			0
’ she added : ‘ if such abilities can be passed on from one generation to the next , then over time we will see them getting better and better and better at predicting human behaviour			0
’ the unspoken commands included pointing to or gazing at a location for the dogs to move to , and recording how they reacted			0
dr @entity39 , who co-wrote the paper with her colleague @entity70 , said : ‘ dogs have been selected through the domestication process to accept humans as social partners and as such , are very good at attending to their behaviour			2
‘ if such abilities can be passed on from one generation to the next than over time we will see them getting better and better and better at predicting human behaviour			0

study was led by scientists at the @entity16 , @entity17
they showed dogs ' ability to understand humans is innate and does not depend on training
observed how dogs responded to *visual* clues from *owners*
