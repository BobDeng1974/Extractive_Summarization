no it 's not @entity2 's new high - speed crime fighting car - but if it was , it would have speeding crooks quaking in their boots			2
it 's a $ 200,000 promotional sports car , a @entity0 actually , which has been unleashed on schools across @entity7 , @entity8 as a part of a campaign to grab students ' attention and get them engaging with the state 's police force			1
the mean - looking motor vehicle joined a northern @entity7 fleet of squad cars this year , after the success of an earlier @entity20 model - the @entity21 - which was first issued to police for the same promotional reasons in 2012			0
it is suitably equipped , however , as a weapon for high - speed chases with sirens and flashing lights attached			0
at top speed , the blue - and - white cheque sports car is able to reach 259km/hr but that speed is rarely , if ever , required			1
what does work best on students though is its sleek design and unique markings - the brain child of a university student who won a competition to have them plastered on the side of the vehicle			0
the earlier model @entity21 was provided to the @entity54 by @entity55 back in 2012 - but the new model has since been rolled - out with a face - lift it is worth $ 200,000 and comes fully equipped with all the tools you would find in an ordinary patrol car for the past two years , @entity62 have sponsored a @entity21 for officers from @entity64 to attend schools , community events , charity fund - raisers and local youth programs , and generate positive interactions between police and the community			1
the success of the program has seen @entity62 extend their support to sponsoring this white 2014 @entity0 , which will continue to visit events across the state			0
@entity62 managing director , @entity77 said its roll - out was the first of its kind when it was issued to the @entity8 police force in 2012			2
' this is the first time we 've made available a @entity20 to any police force in @entity2 and the curiosity factor alone of a @entity21 in police decals should help the @entity54 achieve awareness and engage people in its community programs '			0
the new vehicle , with blue and white cheques , is an upgraded version of an earlier model rolled - out in 2012 the car belongs to the @entity96 , which operates in @entity7 's north shore the vehicle 's design was put to the public as part of a competition with a student from @entity104 winning			1

@entity0 is worth $ 200,000 and is part of @entity8 police fleet
however , the car is not actually used on the nation 's roads as a crime fighter vehicle
it 's a promotional car aimed to at engaging police with school students
it has a top speed of 259km/hr , blue and white police cheques and a sleek looking streamlined design
