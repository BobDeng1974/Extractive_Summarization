as a @entity1 diehard who once saw treble dreams evaporate in the wake of a refereeing error that favoured @entity5 , @entity6 takes a predictably wry view of the anguish emanating from @entity9 in recent days			1
in 1989 , @entity6 was part of the @entity12 side which contested an @entity14 final with two trophies already banked			1
he was involved in a touchline tussle with @entity17 that saw the @entity5 skipper seize the ball and take a throw - in that should have gone the other way			2
ten seconds later – following a defensive blunder from @entity24 – @entity25 had fired home the only goal of the game			0
@entity1 legend @entity6 says @entity5 have a case of ' sour grapes ' about their recent @entity14 exit twenty six years on , @entity5 have seen their own hopes of a clean sweep disappear amid intense controversy			1
they have written to the @entity35 seeking ' to understand ' how the match officials failed to spot the hand @entity38 used to block a @entity39 shot in their semi-final defeat to @entity42			1
@entity6 views the whole furore as ' a bit of sour grapes ' that speaks of the frustration within his old rivals			1
' it 's hard for officials given the pace of the game , ' said @entity6			1
' @entity5 have been frustrated because they have not managed to win a @entity52 and @entity1 have not been in the league for a number of years			1
i 'm sure if @entity1 were in that position they would have won a @entity52 in that time , probably two or three ... ' the last comment was delivered with a grin			2
@entity6 could rant at refs with the best of them during his time in charge of @entity63 , not least when @entity64 was fooled by a @entity66 dive and awarded @entity67 a penalty that effectively relegated the @entity70 side			1
@entity64 was the extra official behind the goal on sunday and has shared the brunt of @entity5 fans ' wrath with ref @entity75			2
' it basically put us down that day but it was one of those things , a referee 's interpretation , ' reflected a more sanguine @entity6 on his own brush with @entity64			1
' it is crazy now			0
the boy @entity75 is a right good referee			0
results went against me when he was refereeing and i was at @entity63			0
but he is a good ref , an honest guy			0
if he had seen it he would have given the penalty			2
' if decisions went against me at @entity63 , i would say to him through frustration			2
but when i thought about it , he never did it intentionally			0
i don ' t think any of the officials do			0
@entity42 defender @entity38 blocks a goal - bound header with his hand but no penalty is given ' it is impossible for the guy on the line to see it ( @entity38 ' handball )			1
you see the angle of the ref , there is a defender in front of him			0
it is that quick a reaction			0
you have to judge it on what you see and if you do n't see it you ca n't give it			0
' and what of 1989 ? despite the impact of that throw - in call , @entity6 still believes @entity1 only had themselves to blame			1
' @entity120 was the ref - that 's why i 've never sent any @entity120 's cards , ' he quipped			0
' but @entity1 were bad that day			2
@entity5 were n't much better but we did not deserve to win it , we were poor			2
' the throw - in should have gone to us , but fair play to big @entity17 , he grabbed the ball			0
the officials let him away with it and @entity5 won the game , but these things happen do n't they ? ' @entity6 was speaking to promote fan ownership group @entity135 which has over 13,400 members			1

@entity5 were knocked out of the @entity14 semi-final by @entity42 after officials failed to award them a penalty for a *blatant* handball
their @entity14 exit ended any hopes of securing a *domestic* treble this *season*
@entity1 legend @entity6 experienced *similar* frustration in 1989 , when the @entity12 side also *missed* out on winning three trophies *due* to poor officiating
but @entity6 says that @entity5 's complaints about the *incident* are ' sour grapes '
