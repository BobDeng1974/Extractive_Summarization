if you 've ever looked in awe at smart skin being developed for robots , do n't worry - your own is far more intelligent			0
neurons in human skin perform advanced calculations scientists previously believed only the brain could carry out , it has been revealed			1
researchers say that in fact our skin passes far more information to the brain that had previously been thought			1
skin is far more sensitive than we thought , and transmits more information than researchers had previously thought			0
our touch experiences are already processed by neurons in the skin before they reach the brain for further processing			1
researchers found that the skin actually calculates geometric data itself before sending signals to the brain			1
previously , it has been thought that far more basic information was sent			0
this is according to a study from @entity32 in @entity33 published in the journal @entity35			0
it found that the skin actually calculates geometric data itself before sending signals to the brain			1
according to researchers at the @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity32 , this branching allows first - order tactile neurons not only to send signals to the brain that something has touched the skin , but also process geometric data about the object touching the skin			2
' our work has shown that two types of first - order tactile neurons that supply the sensitive skin at our fingertips not only signal information about when and how intensely an object is touched , but also information about the touched object 's shape , ' said @entity65 , who is one of the researchers behind the study			2
researchers found that the skin actually calculates geometric data itself before sending signals to the brain			2
the study also shows that the sensitivity of individual neurons to the shape of an object depends on the layout of the neuron ’s highly - sensitive zones in the skin			0
' perhaps the most surprising result of our study is that these peripheral neurons , which are engaged when a fingertip examines an object , perform the same type of calculations done by neurons in the cerebral cortex , ' @entity65 said			0
' somewhat simplified , it means that our touch experiences are already processed by neurons in the skin before they reach the brain for further processing / '			1

@entity33 team find skin processes touch information before sending it to brain
neurons in skin carry out *complex* calculations
