by @entity0 last updated at 12:47 pm on 21st february 2012 it ’s one of the most technologically advanced devices ever built and will give cosmologists incredible insights into the origins of the universe			1
@entity9 's @entity8 , if it ’s a success , will herald a new era in the understanding of the universe , because it will be able to look further back in time , and with more clarity , than any telescope that exists today			2
@entity9 boasts that the telescope is 100 times more powerful that the @entity16 , a device that has already given star - gazers thousands of stunning images of the cosmos			2
@entity21 above : this image shows an artist 's concept of the @entity8 @entity25 performer : this illustration shows how far back in time the @entity8 will look compared to the @entity27 and the @entity16 but the project has a dark side - it is costing the @entity31 space agency so much money that it is acting like a financial black hole , sucking funds away from other projects and threatening their future			2
the telescope began as a $ 500million project in the late 1990s , but that cost has now ballooned to over $ 8.8billion			1
last year @entity40 tried to permanently halt the project			0
it ’s all systems go at the moment , but it ’s such a drain on @entity9 ’s budget that the agency may only be able to afford one big science mission per decade from now on , with some key projects killed off			0
for example , @entity49 staff warn that a mission to bring @entity53 soil back to @entity54 may now be too expensive to carry out			1
on reflection : the mirrors are prepared for cryogenic testing , where they will be subjected to temperatures dipping to @entity60 , permitting engineers to measure in extreme detail how the shape of each mirror changes as it cools not only that , but @entity8 will sit much further out into space			0
@entity16 is in orbit 350 miles above the @entity54			1
@entity8 will gaze into the cosmos almost a million miles from @entity54			1
the area of @entity8 ’s mirror , meanwhile , is six and a quarter times larger than @entity16 ’s			0
the larger primary mirror the more light from objects the telescope can see			0
three of the 18 @entity8 mirror segments mounted on a test stand at the x-ray & @entity79 at @entity9 's @entity80 in @entity81 fine tuning : engineers from @entity84 inspect the first mirror segment upon its arrival at @entity80 it will also have new communications networks to transmit and store large quantities of data and ultra-sensitive infrared detectors to record extremely faint signals			0
all this means @entity8 will see objects that are fainter and farther away and allow scientists to peer back to a time when galaxies were just forming			0
the @entity8 is due to launch in 2018 , with various components currently undergoing rigorous testing .			1

its cost has risen from $ 500million to $ 8.8billion
it will launch in 2018 and operate nearly a million miles from @entity54
