the owners of the @entity2 pageant have announced that there will be no swimsuit round in next year 's competition			1
in an interview with @entity8 , chairwoman @entity6 explained : ' i really ... do n't need to see women just walking up and down in bikinis			1
it does n't do anything for the woman			1
and it does n't do anything for any of us			1
' she added : ' i do n't care if someone has a bottom two inches bigger than someone else 's			1
we are really not looking at her bottom			2
we are really listening to her speak			2
pictured : 2014 winner @entity31 ( middle ) after getting the crown @entity2 , which was founded in 1951 by mrs @entity6 's late husband @entity34 , started as a contest dedicated exclusively to swimwear called the @entity37			1
but recently , she has come to feel that the swimsuit round is archaic and unnecessary			1
as such , the pageant has elected not to broadcast the bikini portion of the show in recent years , judging the girls privately in front of a small panel instead			1
but as of 2015 , they plan to do away with the swimsuit round altogether			1
' we do n't want to just make them feel like they are walking bodies , you know ? ' explained mrs @entity6			2
mrs @entity6 , who is in her seventies , also revealed that she is hoping to set her competition apart from other pageants by emphasizing brains and personality over physical beauty			2
flashback : @entity2 , founded in 1951 by @entity60 , started as a contest dedicated exclusively to swimwear			1
( left , 1956 winner @entity63			2
left , 1971 winner @entity64 ) change of hands : after mr @entity60 's death in 2000 , his wife @entity66 took over			2
pictured : the @entity70 contestants in their swimsuits one step was the creation of @entity74 , the service element of the competition which she started in 1974			2
in order to win this part of the event , the contestant must be judged as having done the most relevant and important charity project in her nation			1
this year 's @entity2 winner , @entity31 of @entity85 , was crowned last weekend , and it 's clear to see why she best represents what the competition stands for			1
the 22 - year - old is a fourth year medical student and science is clearly in her blood			0
her parents are a doctor and nurse , and in a pre-taped interview for the pageant , @entity31 said that becoming miss @entity97 and @entity2 and studying medicine were her ' childhood dreams '			1
stike a pose : miss @entity103 1987 @entity102 wears a glittery one - piece that is truly a sign of the times @entity107 shot : eight of the beauty queens from the 1981 @entity110 pose for a photo in short shorts , tank tops and heels ' everyone in my town called me little dr @entity118 , ' she said			0
' because i was always the little curly - headed girl running around behind my dad in the hospital			0
' i 'm a test tube baby and i believe my passion for health was born with me , ' she added			0
as well as being a medical student , @entity124 is bilingual and speaks fluent @entity126 , as well as @entity127			0
paying tribute to her country after being crowned , she said : ' @entity97 this is for you			0
i think i will brace myself for what 's about to happen			0
it 's a huge responsibility			0
' brains and beauty : this year 's @entity2 winner , @entity31 of @entity85 , was crowned last weekend , and it 's clear to see why she best represents what the competition stands for good example : the 22 - year - old from @entity97 ( middle ) is a fourth year medical student and speaks fluent @entity126 , as well as @entity127 by eliminating the swimsuit round , mrs @entity6 says she hopes to distinguish her pageant from those like the @entity147 - owned @entity146 , which places a large emphasis on the bikini contest			1
in fact , following the death of her husband in 2000 , mr @entity147 apparently called mrs @entity6 to ask if she was ' ready to throw in the towel '			0
his comments prompted her to take out a $ 5million loan in order to bolster the company			0
' they are not little girls , ' she said of her contestants			0
' this is what i want to get away from			0
this sort of " cute " image			0
no offense to mr. @entity147			0

in recent years , @entity2 has judged the swimsuit portion in front of a small panel instead of broadcasting it on tv , but as of 2015 they plan to do away with it altogether
