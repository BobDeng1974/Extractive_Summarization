previously unbeaten in four starts , the impressive @entity10 @entity9 winner was installed as ante - post favourite for the @entity14 feature after his 11 - length romp in the @entity16 back in july			1
however , after making his own running in the hands of @entity19 for the majority of the @entity22 event , @entity1 was overhauled inside the final furlong and readily eclipsed by @entity24 aboard @entity26 ’s four - year - old			2
success : @entity1 is fancied for the @entity28 , despite a shock defeat taking the lead : coral have eased their odds from 7/2 to 6/1 but still fancy @entity1 for the @entity28 coral reacted by easing @entity1 to 6 - 1 ( from 7 - 2 ) for the @entity28 , while @entity6 was introduced into the market at 16 - 1			1
