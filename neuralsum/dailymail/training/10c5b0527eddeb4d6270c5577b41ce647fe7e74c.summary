by @entity0 one of the most popular houses ever featured on @entity3 's @entity2 is on sale for £ 5,000 less than it cost to build 10 years ago			2
@entity6 and @entity7 spent £ 380,000 on their loch - side home in the village of @entity11 , near @entity12 , overrunning their budget by £ 150,000			1
but despite a decade passing which included a property bubble , a crash and another boom , @entity15 is now on sale for just £ 375,000 - despite its striking original design and uninterrupted views over the @entity22			1
spectacular : designed to look like a modern - day @entity27 longhouse , this home in @entity11 , @entity25 , has uninterrupted views of @entity29 and the @entity22			1
but its owners @entity6 and @entity7 , who featured on the @entity3 show @entity2 , overran their budget for building it by £ 150,000 and it is now on sale for less than it cost novel : the couple bought their plot of land on a steep slope for just £ 35,000 , but the costs of their build soon spiralled beyond the original budget of £ 230,000 bedroom : @entity48 features heavily throughout the three - bedroom home , which housed the couple and their young daughter for almost a decade before they sold up the couple 's mission to build the house from scratch in 2003 featured in the fourth series of the @entity3 property show			1
the classical musicians , who had a young daughter when they started their build , found their plot on a steep slope overlooking @entity29 and the @entity22 for just £ 35,000			2
using an oak frame , they imitated the look of a @entity27 longhouse and set the home in several terrace ' steps ' so it would look as though it was bursting out of the hill			0
but like many of the avant - garde designs on the show , the three - bedroom house soon ran into difficulties			1
work took longer than expected and the costs spiralled out of control , having to slow down over the chilly northern winter of 2003			0
mr @entity7 told the programme at the time : ' you get bills through the post all the time and just sit there and go , " i ca n't pay this "			0
' at one point we did actually put it on the market just because things got so tough			0
it was a balance as to what would make us happier , not having the debt or having the house			0
but we hung in and tightened the belt and got through that patch			0
' his wife added : ' it 's that rollercoaster feeling where you just want to get off			0
' a longhouse with a view : despite its rural location , the house is an hour 's commute from @entity12 on a route which involves taking the traditional @entity11 ferry idyll : the living room is under a vaulted ceiling with eight roof lights - but despite the avant - garde design , the home still costs less than a @entity116 flat property agent @entity117 said : ' the market in @entity119 is definitely in recovery mode now but it 's far from overheating compared to other parts of the @entity122 ' despite the setbacks , the couple completed their home and it attracted high praise from hard - to - please presenter @entity127 , who listed it in his 20 favourite @entity2 homes of all time			1
he described the longhouse as ' a beautiful , romantic building , like a ship or an ark even , and it ’s a well - crafted piece of architecture '			2
an hour from @entity12 on a route which includes a traditional ferry , the family house has an l - shaped living room , breathtaking sea views , a vaulted ceiling with six roof lights , a study and a separate ' intimate ' living area with a wood - burning stove			2
it first featured on the property show in march 2004 and the couple were revisited in 2007 - and suffered a fairly major setback when its roof blew off during severe gales which battered @entity119 in december 2012			2
now it has failed to attract a higher price than it cost to build			0
property agent @entity117 , of @entity156 , told @entity157 he expected it to sell for around £ 375,000 , which is the ' offers over ' price as is common in @entity119 , or up to five per cent more			1
however , the low cost has tempted several buyers from @entity162 - as the spectacular home is less pricy than an average flat in @entity116 , according to the house prices website @entity166			1
lochs of love : @entity127 described the longhouse as ' a beautiful , romantic building , like a ship or an ark even , and it 's a well - crafted piece of architecture ' beloved : the property show fronted by @entity127 ( pictured ) , which has featured more than 100 homes , focused on the house in 2004 and again in 2007 @entity178 ( centre with @entity127 and @entity7 ) said at the time : ' you get bills through the post all the time and just sit there and go , " i ca n't pay this " ... at one point we did actually put it on the market just because things got so tough			1
it was a balance as to what would make us happier , not having the debt or having the house ' ' the property market in @entity119 is definitely in recovery mode now but it 's far from overheating compared to other parts of the @entity122 , ' he said			1
' we 've had a lot of interest and most of it has been from south of the border			0
' he added : ' the price we 're asking was set at the market rate , so it did n't take into account the cost to build			0
' other houses from the @entity3 show have had a mixed fate , with some soaring in value while other fall victim to the so - called ' curse of @entity2 '			0
a four - bedroom house in @entity218 dubbed the ' @entity219 ' featured on the show in 2008 and cost £ 775,000 , but has since sold for £ 1.5million			1
and a two - bed ' low - carbon ' home in @entity223 , south @entity116 , featured in 2012 and was put on the market the next year at almost £ 1million more than it cost to build			2
but not all have been so lucky			0
last summer it was reported a nine - storey water tower in @entity229 , south @entity116 , had £ 2million knocked off its asking price after initially being offered for £ 6.5million			0
owners @entity231 and @entity233 bought the @entity235 listed building , part of a former factory site , for £ 380,000 and spent almost £ 2million converting it from a crumbling ruin into a home			1
