' there was a story of a double suicide in the @entity85 where two students had killed themselves , she said			2
' it was to do with quantum physics and suicide , the two students were linked up to lethal injections which were operated by lottery numbers			2

a therapist who treated mr @entity10 over ten months in 2012 said she had no reason to suspect that he was at high risk of committing suicide			1

@entity2 investigator @entity144 told the court that he was also seen on external cameras standing outside the building looking at the roof			1
access to the top floor of the holding is limited to an alarmed fire exit and an access hatch with a padlock , which had been removed when police arrived on the scene			2

close friend and colleague @entity193 was given the grim task of gathering mr @entity10 's belongings together			2
he said : ' as part of the process of getting his personal effects together we spent quite a long time going through his desk			0
family : mr @entity10 's sister @entity202 was also at the inquest where a verdict of suicide was recorded ' there was nothing on there particularly untoward about suicide or the building itself			1
there was a map of @entity14 , but there was nothing to indicate that he had actively done any reconnaissance on the building to find an area			2
' but mr @entity193 said his friend was having ' some very unusual thoughts and confided with me about them			0
' he thought @entity22 was maybe a witch			0
' mr @entity10 's father , @entity224 , had travelled to the @entity177 with sister , @entity225 , to hear details of the time leading to his death			1

@entity10 's father @entity18 refused to accept the suicide verdict , accusing @entity2 of ' murder by omission '			1
he demanded to know why @entity2 security staff did not stop his son accessing the roof			1
speaking outside the court , he said : ' why was n't he stopped ? ' the security features in place - cameras and entry alarms - should have alerted security and they should have taken responsibility for keeping any @entity2 employee from accessing the roof of the @entity2 building			1
' this negligence on the part of @entity2 cost my son his life			2
that negligence killed my son			0
' the inquest heard that mr @entity10 accessed security the top floors of the building via a fire escape , according to his security pass logs			1
however , his movements were not analysed because his pass allowed him into those areas from his office on the ninth floor			0
checks of the pass and cctv after his death showed he made several visits to the top level of the building , once in november 2013 and once in january , days before he died			2
mr @entity10 , speaking after the inquest , said : ' i do n't want to accept that [ verdict ]			1

mr @entity144 replied that their security was focused on preventing unauthorised people getting in rather than people breaking out			0
mr @entity144 said : ' @entity2 is not a prison , it is a place of work			1
' he said @entity10 had cut open a lock on a hatch on the fire escape , which was next to an alarmed door which would have alerted security if he had tried to open it			2

she added : ' @entity2 have of course a duty of care to their employees and a duty to keep them as safe as possible			0
' but there has to be a balance that is struck between the safety of employees and ... not imprisoning the employees			0
' if there had been a fire and any escape route had been blocked we would be here asking why that was			0
' a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' our heartfelt condolences go out to @entity10 ’s family and friends			1
