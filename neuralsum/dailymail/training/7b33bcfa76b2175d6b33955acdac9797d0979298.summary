homeowners in one @entity2 town have found themselves living a real life @entity4 horror story			2
thanks to an urban legend that claims the ' portal to hell ' is located near some obscure storm drains in @entity10 , @entity2 , scores of feisty teens , horror fanatics , and folks who just like a good old scare flock there in scores , especially come @entity18			1
the problem is , this ' portal ' is located on private property , and all the commotion is a major nuisance for the homeowners who actually own said property			1
' people park in their driveway and try to get into the drainage system and nobody likes that			0
( the owner ) has had to chase off some people , for sure			0
' the folklore surrounding the site dates back a few decades , to when some claim that those who worship the man down below practiced their religion in the area			0
' a group of @entity57 supposedly used to meet there in some type of altar room and conduct their rituals , ' says @entity63 blogger @entity62			1
' they must have been pretty good , because the legend claims they managed to open a doorway to hell			2
' urban legend : ' a group of @entity57 supposedly used to meet there in some type of altar room and conduct their rituals , ' says @entity63 blogger @entity62 watch your step : people sometimes park in the property owners driveways to explore , which is a nuisance as a result , people report hearing screams , seeing floating faces and having contact with apparitions when around this spooky setting			1
it even got a seal of approval from ghost hunter and filmmaker @entity91 , who filmed a visit to the site and called it , ' one of the scariest locations [ he had ] ever investigated			0
' weird noises : the strange sounds heard could be chalked up to the various tunnels located underground and echoes light at the end : some warn that a serious storm could cause visitors to drown in the storm pipes so for anyone looking for a fright , or to glimpse a possible ' portal to hell , ' this sounds like just the place - just make sure to keep down the noise out of respect for the neighbors			2
or wait until @entity113 uses this as the inspiration for an upcoming season of @entity117 .			0

according to urban legend , the ' portal to hell ' is located in a storm drain in @entity10 , @entity2
it is also located on private property , and homeowners are not a fan of the noise when visitors check out the area
