researchers have uncovered the mystery of @entity3 's ' stealth ' colour scheme			1
the say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted @entity3 black over billions of years			1
it solves the mystery of @entity3 's unusual colouring - which has baffled scientists			1
the say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted @entity3 with a dark ' stealth ' coating over billions of years			1
cometary dust is composed of as much as 25 percent carbon by weight , so @entity3 would be exposed to a steady bombardment of carbon from these crumbling comets			1
using a model of impact delivery and a known estimate of micrometeorite flux at @entity3 , researchers calculated suggest that after billions of years of bombardment , @entity3 's surface should be anywhere from 3 to 6 percent carbon			1
' it 's long been hypothesized that there 's a mystery darkening agent that 's contributing to @entity3 's low reflectance , ' said @entity34 , a postdoctoral researcher at @entity35 who performed this research while a graduate student at @entity38			1
' one thing that had n't been considered was that @entity3 gets dumped on by a lot of material derived from comets			2
' on average , @entity3 is much darker than its closest airless neighbour , our @entity43			2
airless bodies are known to be darkened by micrometeorite impacts and bombardment of solar wind , processes that create a thin coating of dark iron nanoparticles on the surface			0
but spectral data from @entity3 suggests its surface contains very little nanophase iron , certainly not enough to account for its dim appearance			2
as comets approach @entity3 's neighborhood near the sun , they often start to break apart			1
cometary dust is composed of as much as 25 percent carbon by weight , so @entity3 would be exposed to a steady bombardment of carbon from these crumbling comets			1
using a model of impact delivery and a known estimate of micrometeorite flux at @entity3 , @entity34 was able to estimate how often cometary material would impact @entity3 , how much carbon would stick to @entity3 's surface , and how much would be thrown back into space			1
her calculations suggest that after billions of years of bombardment , @entity3 's surface should be anywhere from 3 to 6 percent carbon			1
the next part of the work was to find out how much darkening could be expected from all that impacting carbon			0
for that , the researchers turned to the @entity85			0
the 14 - foot canon simulates celestial impacts by firing projectiles at up to 16,000 miles per hour			0
experiments show that impact material is significantly darkened when impacts occur in the presence of complex organics - shown here on the right for this study , the team launched projectiles in the presence of sugar , a complex organic compound that mimics the organics in comet material			0
the heat of an impact burns the sugar up , releasing carbon			0
projectiles were fired into a material that mimics lunar basalt , the rock that makes up the dark patches on the nearside of the @entity43			0
' we used the lunar basalt model because we wanted to start with something dark already and see if we could darken it further , ' said @entity118 , professor emeritus of geological sciences at @entity38 and a co-author of the new research			0
the experiments showed that tiny carbon particles become deeply embedded in the impact melted material			0
the process reduced the amount of light reflected by the target material to less than 5 percent -- about the same as the darkest parts of @entity3			2
importantly , spectroscopic analysis of the impact samples revealed no distinctive spectral fingerprints , again similar to flat spectral signatures from @entity3			2
' we show that carbon acts like a stealth darkening agent , ' @entity135 said			0
' from the standpoint of spectral analysis , it 's like an invisible paint			0
' and that paint has been building up on @entity3 's surface for billions of years			1
' we think this is a scenario that needs to be considered , ' @entity135 said			0
' it appears that @entity3 may well be a painted planet			2

dusting of carbon from passing comets has made @entity3 darker
@entity3 's surface is anywhere from 3 to 6 percent carbon
has given the planet an almost black appearance
