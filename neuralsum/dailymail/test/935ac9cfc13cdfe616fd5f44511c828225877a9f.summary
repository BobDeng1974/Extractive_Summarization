but she added it was ' another matter ' whether a vote for her party in the 2016 @entity18 elections would bring about a second vote on independence			0
ms @entity14 has also vehemently criticised @entity34 's pledge to hold an in - out referendum on @entity36			1

@entity16 election campaign director @entity77 insisted the poll showed support for his party 's main policies			2
he said : ' this is a very welcome poll - it demonstrates that the people of @entity2 share our view that the @entity88 parties are not delivering on their referendum vow , and want far more power for @entity2			2
