a couple 's adventure touring the beautiful wildlife of @entity3 is set to be documented in a stunning new photobook			1
@entity5 , 53 , and @entity6 , 47 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , utilised remote controlled camera buggies , hidden cameras and quad - copters among other things , to portray @entity14 wildlife in different ways			1
the couple have managed to join in with packs of cheetahs , wild dogs , elephants and one occasion grabbing the attention of a young lion for a photo mr @entity25 calls the ' lion selfie '			2
' we carry more photographic gear on safari than almost anyone , except perhaps the @entity56 , ' said mr @entity25			0
' people ( and animals ) are most intrigued by our remote - controlled camera buggy though			0
' the battery operated 4wd camera buggy was custom made to carry a @entity65 @entity64 camera with a 16 - 35mm lens			0
the pair use the buggy primarily on private game reserves or conservancies with the approval of the guide or game reserve manager			0
mr @entity25 said : ' low and wide angle shots of wild animals are rare captures			0
unlike normal shots taken from the roof of a vehicle , the horizon is low and the animal looks large as it approaches the hidden camera or buggy			0
people simply are n't used to seeing this perspective			0
' the photographs , including this cheetah at a @entity88 in @entity89 , will be documented in a 204 - page book set to be launched on @entity51 imminently the battery operated 4wd camera buggy was custom made to carry a @entity65 @entity64 camera with a 16 - 35mm lens the wildlife - loving @entity8 the buggy primarily on private game reserves or conservancies with the approval of the guide or game reserve manager ; here eland run towards the camera the couple have spent more than 22 weeks in @entity3 over the past two years alone , photographing for the book and have got frighteningly close to an array of wildlife			1
' we put the buggy out with a male lion one day but when it started raining , i drove it back to our safari vehicle , ' said mr @entity25 explaining the day they snapped the ' @entity113 '			0
' two sub adults saw it and followed it back			0
not wanting them to damage it , i drove it under the vehicle hoping they 'd depart			0
they did n't so @entity6 quickly mounted a camera on a monopod and connected a remote shutter			1
i lowered the monopod through the open window and when the lion came closer and started pawing it gently , @entity6 clicked the remote shutter - my lower hand just 50cm from its paw			1
' @entity5 , 53 , and @entity6 , 47 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , manage to show their love for @entity3 with their stunning photography skills mobile cameras and video cameras capture the wildlife in their natural habitat ; pictured here are buffalo in @entity89 a gorilla in @entity144 makes the final cut in the @entity8 couple 's beautiful set of wildlife photographs the pair , who immersed themselves in photography four years ago , have also used a quad - copter			1
' a number of aerial shots feature in the book , shots that many years ago would have been impossible to capture , ' said mr @entity25			1
' unfortunately , a couple of countries have limited the use of drones over the past 12 months so these shots will be harder to acquire in the future			1
' mr @entity25 's wife had been to @entity3 in the 90 's but it took her two decades to convince him to join her on a second safari			1
he said : ' @entity6 thought i would love it but for decades i resisted			1
then one day , she called me at work and said , ' i 've decided we 're taking the boys ( then aged 10 and 12 ) on safari in @entity3			1
i 've booked flights for the four of us ; you can book the accommodation '			0
' a group of lions looking into the camera buggy in @entity38 , thankfully the photographer was at a safe distance this photo shows a giraffe from eye level which was shot using the quad - copter in @entity38 a leopard makes a move as it appears to hunt its prey , caught on camera very close - up , in @entity38 this lion 's intrigue saw him get up close and personal to the camera , but unfortunately for her , it was n't edible resigned to the prospect , mr @entity25 scoured the net and , being a passionate photographer , bought a number of african wildlife photography books			2
' i quickly became aware of the awe - inspiring photographic opportunities that a safari offered and decided i would embrace the trip , ' said mr @entity25			0
since then the @entity205 have shot more than a quarter of a million images and have settled on 143 of their best to feature in this large format book , @entity3 on @entity49 , to be published by @entity209 - based @entity208 and released later this year			1
this elephant in @entity89 is caught doing some of its daily exercise as its trunk reaches into the foliage a leopard guards a dead zebra ; all aspects of life on safari are documents in the photo set mrs @entity6 added : ' a lot of our work requires two people			2
@entity5 can be a little disorganised and when you have 3,000 images to wade through at day 's end , my organisational skills come to the fore			1
having two of us shooting also allows one to shoot wide , the other tight , resulting in two different perspectives			0
' the couple admit that with so many great shots to choose from , it 's hard to leave certain shots out			2
' we have an abundance of lion photos , we could do a whole world - class book on lions but we 're having to jettison so many of them so it 's not lion - indulgent , ' explains mr @entity25			0

a pack of inquisitive lions are pictured looking at the camera buggy in @entity38 , operated at a safe distance by the @entity205 @entity251 gets right into it with the gorilla 's in a bid to get the perfect photograph			2

@entity5 and @entity6 from @entity8 used various *techniques* to photograph wildlife at its most natural
they plan to feature more than 140 of their finest images , along with the story behind each one , in @entity3 on @entity49
the couple have spent more than 22 weeks in @entity3 over the past two years alone
