by @entity1 reporter published : 09:19 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 11:57 est , 22 november 2012 a grandmother was left stranded in @entity3 after @entity4 banned her from flying - for ' touching ' an attendant 's arm ' to get her attention '			1
@entity8 , 62 , was barred after the airline claimed she ' assaulted ' the staff member by twisting her arm as she queued to board at @entity12			1
but mother - of - two @entity13 , who has two grandchildren , insists she did no such thing and is furious at her treatment , claiming the airline also banned her for life , which it denies			2
mrs @entity8 , from @entity18 , @entity19 , said : ' to be accused of assaulting somebody just for touching them is absolutely ludicrous			2
mrs @entity8 , pictured left with her grandson @entity22 and husband @entity23 , says she was barred from @entity4 and ordered off a plane after touching a flight attendant on the arm ' i could n’t believe the way they reacted , the way they treated me was appalling			1
i have travelled all over the world and i have never been treated or spoken to like that in my life			0
' the row started when mrs @entity8 was told her hand luggage was too big and needed to go in the hold			2
she says when she tried to argue her case she she was ignored repeatedly , so she touched the handler 's arm to get her attention			1
the staff member summoned a supervisor , who promptly banned mrs @entity8 from the flight			1
the grandmother , who was meant to be flying home to @entity47 with sister @entity48 , said : ' we had paid for priority boarding so we should have been among the first to get on the plane but when we arrived at the gate there was only one queue			0
grandmother @entity8 , 62 , was left furious after @entity4 stopped her from flying to @entity55 from @entity12 , @entity3 , over an alleged assault ' by the time we got to the front the attendant stopped us and said ‘ you , you wait there ’			1
she said our bags were too big to fit in the overheard lockers and would need to be checked in			0
' @entity48 started to panic as she had a lot of important paperwork with her and did n’t want to let it go			0
' she just kept ignoring us but the whole time she was allowing other passengers to board the plane with bags much larger than ours and we could see them going across the tarmac with their cases			0
' i tried to get her attention by touching her arm and she said , " do not touch me			2
you are not flying "			0
' mrs @entity8 says the sisters then tried to rebook on to an @entity4 flight the next day but was told she could n't because she was barred for life			1
so the pair , who had been enjoying a break at @entity13 's holiday home in @entity83 , @entity84 , rented a car and drove the two - hour journey back to the villa			1
they finally managed to get home yesterday on low - cost rival @entity90 but are still furious at their treatment at the hands of the @entity96 - based airline			2
mrs @entity8 's husband , @entity23 , 65 , said : ' it seems totally wrong two elderly women can be abandoned in a foreign country on the whim of a petty local official			1
' surely if my wife had committed an assault then she should have been arrested or cautioned			0
but as she was not , then i guess there will be no official record of this			0
' can airlines just ban somebody on the whim of an employee , who may just have been having a bad day ? @entity8 claims @entity4 barred her from flying the next day after the row , so she booked with @entity90 instead ' @entity8 is 62			1
she ’s never had a criminal record and she ’s never been arrested			0
' her sister , @entity48 , had a very traumatic experience at the same airport two - and - a - half years ago , when her husband @entity118 collapsed and died from a heart attack - so it was doubly upsetting for her			0
' @entity4 insist mrs @entity8 is welcome on future flights , including the ones she has booked with the airline to @entity123 next year , but she says she will never fly with them again			1
a spokesman for the airline said : ' the customer has not been banned for life or from any future flights			0
' she was prevented from boarding following an incident with a staff member which was witnessed by the police			0
