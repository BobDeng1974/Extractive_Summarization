could this be the worst corner routine ever devised by a professional football team ? @entity2 , who play in the top tier of @entity6 football , tried something a little different in their 1 - 1 draw with @entity9 at the weekend			1
lining up for a corner , five of their outfield players congregated on the edge of the opposition box , before spinning around in a circle - one way , then the other - as they waited for the corner to come in			1
as the @entity9 players watched on in awe , @entity19 struck			0
suddenly , they turned and sprinted into the box in tandem , ready to attack the incoming corner			0
watch : take a look at the corner routine in question the players ( right ) stood in a circle and spun around manically before the corner came in after a short while , the @entity2 players tried to catch the opposition off - guard with a sprint into the box unfortunately , the ball was too deep and a player was left to chase it towards the corner flag unfortunately , after all their effort , the ball in was overhit and one @entity2 player was left sprinting towards the corner flag to retrieve in			1
he did n't get there , and the move was over			0
back to the training ground , eh lads			0
@entity19 sit 12th after their first 14 games this season , but face a stern test this weekend when they host @entity54 .			2

@entity19 are currently 12th in the top *division* of @entity6 football
they devised a *ridiculous* corner routine for their match at the weekend
five players stood in a circle and ran around , before sprinting into the box
the corner went *wrong* when the ball was *lofted* too deep
