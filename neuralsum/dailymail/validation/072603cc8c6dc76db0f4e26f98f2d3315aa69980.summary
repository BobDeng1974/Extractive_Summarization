’ mr @entity7 , the shadow justice minister , is rapidly gaining support on the party back benches as a ‘ clean skin ’ candidate who , unlike many rivals , was not an adviser or minister during the @entity53 or @entity54 governments and is ‘ untainted ’ by association with mr @entity4 ’s inner circle			2
