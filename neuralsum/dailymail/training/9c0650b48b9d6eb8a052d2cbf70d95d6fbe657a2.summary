by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 10:46 est , 21 february 2013 the @entity1 is refusing to make deliveries to 90 homes on a housing estate - because of one ' aggressive ' dog			1
residents in @entity7 have been sent a letter warning them their post has been temporarily suspended for health and safety reasons after two postmen were confronted by the animal			1
one of the men allegedly had to defend himself with his postbag - which was damaged in the attack			0
neither of the postmen were bitten			0
the letter was sent on february 7 to households in and around @entity22 in @entity23			0
post-traumatic : almost 100 homes in and around @entity22 ( pictured ) have to travel four miles to collect their mail because of an aggressive dog at just one property the three streets , comprising 90 houses , that will not get mail delivered thanks to the dog it said a health and safety assessment showed the level of risk was ' unacceptably high due to threat of further dog attacks '			1
it apologised for the inconvenience - and told residents they would have to travel four miles to collect their mail from a delivery office			1
the canine culprit is a dog named @entity47 who lives with owner @entity49 , 36 , and her cat called @entity51			1
she was not available for comment			0
today one neighbour of miss @entity55 said : ' this all seems like an over-reaction			1
the home where jarvis the dog and owner @entity62 are believed to live a royal mail van travelling through the @entity64 in @entity7 today			1
residents will now need to pick there own mail up from the delivery office in @entity69 ' @entity47 is a great dog who is often let out onto the drive way and he runs through the broken down fence into the park next door but he never harms anyone - he just does n't like postmen that 's all			1
' he is always plays with the kids on the park and they do n't get scared by him despite him being a big dog and as far i 'm aware no - one else gets threatened by him			1
' he 's a great dog - it 's just that he seems to have an intense hatred of postmen			1
a park next to @entity22 where the dog is believed to play ' he does get aggressive when they come - i can only assume its to do with the uniforms or the fact they sometimes wear high - visibility jackets			2
' not so long ago there was a broken street light outside the house and a man fixing the telephone mast was wearing a hi - vis jacket			0
@entity47 came bounding out barking at the bottom of the light at the man and he was stuck up there for absolutely ages			1
@entity104 ( left ) , 73 , is furious that so many houses are being punished for one dog			2
@entity107 , 33 , says deliveries only need to be stopped at the address where the dog lives ' i can understand that the postmen do n't want to come near a dog if it 's going to jump at them like but on the other hand why do n't they just complain to police			1
' if they have a problem with one house they should n't be stopping the post down the whole street - its ridiculous			2
@entity62 has @entity47 , the dog , and a cat called @entity51			1
' we 've lived here a year and only spoken to her maybe four times			0
she keeps herself to herself but we have no trouble from her or the dog			2
if he barks at us we tell him to get down and he does every time			0
' the @entity1 said it was working with the dog 's owner to find a solution			2
the mail boycott has divided the estate			2
@entity107 , 33 , said : ' i do n't know the owner but i 've never had any trouble from that dog			1
it 's blatantly obvious to me that they only need to stop deliveries at the address where the dog is , not all these homes			2
' the letter residents received			0
it says the risks of delivering to their area is ' unacceptably high ' due to the dog ( file picture ) neighbour @entity104 , 73 , a great grandfather of three , added : ' it 's absolute rubbish that we are all being punished for one dog			1
' now i have to take a bus and walk for a very long way to collect my mail			2
it 's hard to believe that one dog is affecting all our mail			1
' but other residents said they too had been chased by the dog			2
@entity161 , 24 , of @entity22 , said : ' if it 's too unsafe for the postmen then what about us ? ' we 've got kids - surely something should be done about it			0
it has chased me before			0
it 's a big dog			2
' @entity172 , 32 , said she and her two children - @entity174 , 16 , and @entity175 , 13 - had all been chased by the dog			0
she said : ' it needs to be locked up and restrained for everyone 's safety			0
@entity1 spokeswoman @entity180 said they were working with the council and hoped to resume deliveries soon			0
' as far i 'm aware no - one else gets threatened by him			0
' he 's a great dog - it 's just that he seems to have an intense hatred of postmen			1
' - a neighbour of the dog 's owner she said : ' deliveries have already been suspended to the address where the dog lives and we have asked the owners to keep the dog under control , so that the postman can complete his round safely			1
' unfortunately this has n't happened			0
following a number of near misses and a risk assessment of the area , we have had to temporarily suspend deliveries to these properties as a precautionary measure			1
' @entity211 , @entity7 's assistant mayor for housing and environment , confirmed they had received a complaint about the dog on tuesday			0
the owner of the dog - described as a large dark brown mixed - breed - could not be contacted			0
