a country ranger who is paralysed from the waist down has defied the odds to become a top martial arts instructor - after gaining a black belt in kickboxing			1
@entity7 , 34 , was left wheelchair bound after he was born with spina bifida			1
but incredibly , @entity7 achieved a first dan black belt in kickboxing - by using his arms and hands instead of his feet to ‘ kick ’ opponents			1
he is also an expert in @entity15 , a close - quarter fighting technique created by martial arts legend @entity17			0
@entity7 was awarded a black belt in kickboxing by the world governing body , the @entity21 in 2006			1
he followed the criteria for able - bodied kickboxing but to reflect @entity7 ’s disability the federation rebranded his technique to ‘ freestyle martial arts ’			1
no limits : @entity7 in a standing frame aged eight ( left ) that allowed him to take part in school sports			1
today he teaches both able - bodied and disabled students how to kickbox ( right ) @entity7 , from @entity34 , near @entity35 , @entity36 , said being in a wheelchair is actually an ' advantage ' to being an able - bodied fighter			1
he said : ' i joined a kickboxing club in 2003 - which was quite ironic to be honest			0
' when other people do kicks i do different blocks and different techniques - i have to do two or three times more work with my arms			2
' but being in a wheelchair actually has its advantages , i can even use it to block people			0
it ’s made of metal , there ’s less of a target area to hit and , let ’s face it , there ’s not a lot of point attacking my legs			0
' if someone is 6ft - plus it ’s a case of attacking their knees , legs , shins , stomach and private @entity70 if they ’re really short i aim for their face			0
' mr @entity7 now teaches able - bodied and disabled students kickboxing			2
@entity7 has had to use his skills on a number of occasions , including defending a woman from being attacked by a drunken assailant in a pub in @entity80 three years ago			1
@entity7 , 9 , with sister @entity81 , 8 ( left )			1
@entity7 's other sister @entity82 encouraged him to take up kickboxing 10 years ago @entity7 said : ' i was talking to a girl and she was crouching down and there was a drunk chap who was jumping around			2
' he saw us chatting and tried to barge into the woman but i instinctively saw what was happening and got my wheelchair between her and the man			2
' as he tried to shove into me i used his weight against him and spun myself out of his way so that he fell on the floor instead of us			0
' my friend and the chap were quite astonished but it was just a deviation technique			0
' he seemed quite embarrassed and left shortly afterwards , i was just glad no one got hurt , including the man			2
' @entity7 first got into the sport ten years ago after his sister @entity82 , 37 , got chatting to a martial arts instructor on a night out			2
he said : ' he had a problem , a disability , with his arm , and was encouraging people like myself to do martial arts			0
' my sister asked me ‘ would you like to have a go ? ’ and i said ‘ why not ? ’ ' at the belt gradings people looked at me thinking ‘ what ’s he doing here ? ’ people have always asked me so many questions about it , which is great because it helps raise the profile of disability sport			0
' even now i am still learning different techniques , different ways to move the chair , going through different angles			0
it ’s helped with my confidence so much			0
' @entity7 , who also works as a part - time education ranger at @entity129 , now hopes to gain his second dan grading so he can train people up to black belt .			1
