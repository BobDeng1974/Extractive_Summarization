by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:03 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 07:51 est , 6 july 2013 findings : the police marksman who shot @entity6 dead in north @entity7 in 2005 had ' no lawful justification ' for doing so , an official report said a firearms officer could face trial over the death of a drug dealer in a bungled operation			1
@entity6 , 24 , was ‘ executed ’ in a hail of bullets when his car was stopped by police marksmen who suspected he was about to rob @entity21 rivals			1
the armed officer let off eight shots in less than two seconds from a high - powered carbine at almost point - blank range , claiming he feared the suspect was about to fire a submachine gun			2
but a retired high court judge questioned his account yesterday , ruling there was ‘ no lawful justification ’ for shooting him dead			0
in a highly critical judgment , sir @entity33 castigated almost every aspect of the dangerous operation in april 2005			1
he accused the officer , known only as @entity38 , of firing ‘ pre-emptive ’ shots as police moved in to stop the car carrying three suspected gunmen			1
and he said he did not believe @entity38 held an ‘ honest belief ’ that @entity44 posed a lethal threat			1
sir @entity33 also criticised the lack of planning , excessive force in the so - called ‘ hard stop ’ and the chaotic aftermath			1
his inquiry ruling contradicts the findings of independent investigators and marks a turning point in a long - running legal battle			0
@entity44 ’s mother said her son was ‘ executed ’ and demanded an apology from @entity60 commissioner sir @entity59			1
it also emerged that : lawyers for @entity38 , who retired in 2008 to work as a firearms consultant , have already informed sir @entity33 they will seek a judicial review of his ‘ irrational ’ findings			1
he was one of the most respected officers in the @entity73 ’s elite @entity72 unit and won seven commendations during a 33 - year career			2
in 2008 , after bumping into him at a social function , former deputy assistant commissioner @entity96 – who later led the phone - hacking inquiry – told him : ‘ i ’ve always wanted to meet the @entity60 ’s very own serial killer			1
’ @entity38 complained and was awarded £ 5,000 for ‘ hurt feelings ’ over the ill - judged joke			2
the @entity44 inquiry findings are a vindication for campaigners – including the @entity104 , which fiercely opposed the introduction of secret inquests			1
police repeatedly fought for large swathes of evidence to be heard in secret , supposedly to protect intelligence sources			1
but experts suspect their real motivation was to protect senior officers from humiliation as their shortcomings were systematically exposed			0
they believe much of the evidence revealed during sir @entity33 ’s public inquiry would have been covered up had new legislation been in force			1
@entity44 was shot dead as he travelled with two other men in a @entity78 through @entity84 , @entity123 , on april 30 , 2005			1
sir @entity33 criticised the @entity60 for failing to minimise the danger to @entity44 when it planned the operation , instead leaving vital decisions to armed officers on the ground			1
@entity44 ’s mother , @entity129 , said the report backed her view that he was ‘ executed ’ by the police			1
she added : ‘ this report has found that there was no lawful justification for my son ’s killing by the police			2
@entity139 ’s death was wholly avoidable			0
' i should n’t be sitting here now , beginning another chapter in my fight for justice for him			0
critical : @entity6 's mother @entity129 is seen flanked by @entity147 from @entity148 ( left ) and solicitor @entity149 ( right ) as the inquiry 's findings were published today ‘ the fact that he was strongly suspected in being involved in crime does not justify him or anyone else being summarily killed			1
’ @entity156 , of @entity157 , which campaigns against secret inquests , said : ‘ successive governments used this case to try to justify closed hearings , yet the inquiry did its job without hearing any secret evidence whatsoever			1
‘ let ’s never forget how secrecy can be used as a cloak for illegality , embarrassment and abuses of power			0
’ sir @entity59 said : ‘ we plan our operations to confront the armed and dangerous so as to minimise wherever possible the use of lethal force			2
’ grief : a framed photograph of @entity6 sat in front of his mother ( left ) today as the report into the findings of a public inquiry into the 24 - year - old 's ( right ) death was published the day officer @entity38 killed 2 robbers before killing @entity6 with six bullets , @entity38 had shot dead two armed robbers at an abattoir			1
the marksman was among a team that hid inside a rental van at a meat depot after receiving a tip - off about an armed raid			0
he watched as robbers armed with sawn - off shotguns ran from woods to hijack a @entity202 van which contained £ 120,000			0
emerging from the police van , @entity38 killed two robbers with two shots each , fearing they were about to gun down the @entity202 driver			2
the extraordinary 1987 confrontation in @entity209 , @entity7 , was one of dozens in the officer ’s tumultuous 33 - year career			2
in 1978 he was commended for bravery after taking part in the unarmed arrest of a dangerous gun - carrying villain			0
@entity38 was the first member of the @entity73 ’s specialist firearms unit , then called @entity219 , to fire an ‘ operational shot ’ when saving a girl of four during a siege in december 1985			1
damning report : police are seen removing a silver @entity78 believed to be the car @entity6 was travelling in when he was shot in @entity228 in 2005 he twice shot the kidnapper who later stood trial			1
the marksman received a commander ’s commendation in the 1990s after an armed stand - off with a gunman in a minicab office			0
he said : ‘ i could tell that his heart was n’t in it and i screamed “ armed police ” at him and the man dropped the gun when i was just about to open fire			0
’ in 2004 , the @entity245 recommended that @entity38 be given ‘ words of advice ’ following an armed operation			2
it was claimed that he left a police car without permission during the operation to test his radio and buy coffee			0
@entity38 said his superiors thought it was ‘ a storm in a teacup ’			2
another low point followed his arrest during a drunken brawl at a nightclub in @entity263 , central @entity7 , in december 2000			0
admitting it was ‘ not one of my proudest moments ’ , he told the inquiry : ‘ i ended up with about four or five bouncers on top of me and i ended up in a fight			0
‘ we all do silly things occasionally when we drink but i was old enough and wise enough to know better			0
it was one of those situations that got out of hand			0
’ shortly before he retired , @entity38 was involved in the bizarre ‘ serial killer ’ encounter with @entity60 chief @entity96 for which he won £ 5,000 in compensation and an apology			1
investigation : forensic investigators are seen outside the @entity83 pub in the wake of the shooting by the time he left the frontline in 2008 , @entity38 had received seven commendations and was training a new generation of elite gun cops for @entity73			2
he now works as a consultant for a firearms and ammunition company			0
a former senior officer who worked with @entity38 on numerous operations , described him as a ‘ consummate professional ’			1
he said : ‘ being a firearms officer is one of the toughest jobs in the police because you ’re damned if you do and damned if you do n’t			0
officers have tough choices to make			0
sometimes , armed criminals leave you with little choice			0
it ’s either shoot them or risk the public being hurt			0
‘ in the years i ’ve known the officer referred to as @entity38 , i ’ve always founded him to be very grounded and not gung - ho			2
‘ he often put himself in the most dangerous positions on an operation because he was one of the best			0
‘ he would see things in slow motion and therefore had longer to process what was happening than other officers			0

@entity6 , 24 , gunned down in @entity84 , north @entity7 , in 2005
shot six times by police marksman identified only as @entity38
report published today following public inquiry into robbery suspect 's death
@entity322 had ' no reason ' to believe mr @entity44 had *picked* up a weapon
sir @entity33 said @entity38 's accounts ' are not to be accepted '
emerged in inquiry he *previously* shot two men dead in *incident* in 1980s
the marksman wrote to inquiry to claim findings against him are ' irrational '
*prosecutors* who *originally* gave @entity38 a clean bill of health will *reconsider* whether he should be charged with murder ;
it can be revealed the marksman won an apology for being called a ‘ serial killer ’ by a senior @entity73 officer after he shot dead two armed robbers in an abattoir ;
@entity44 ’s family is preparing a *multi-million* pound compensation claim after years of fighting to find out exactly what happened ;
the findings are a vindication for campaigners who fought government plans for secret inquests that would have covered up swathes of damning evidence .
