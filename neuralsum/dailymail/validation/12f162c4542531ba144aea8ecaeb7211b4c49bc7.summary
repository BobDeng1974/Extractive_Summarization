@entity0 has demanded @entity1 keep their emotions in check against @entity5 today as they look to avoid a repeat of last season ’s @entity8 humiliation			1
the @entity10 were despatched with embarrassing ease at @entity12 during the 2014 @entity13 , the 20 - 0 defeat leading to some commentators questioning whether they should remain part of the @entity17			1
now , having lost their first three matches of this year ’s tournament , @entity19 ’s men head to @entity22 once again in dire straits and with a winless record at ‘ hq ’ that stretches back to 1983			1
@entity1 tighthead @entity27 throws a pass during his side 's captain 's run at @entity22 on friday @entity1 hooker @entity31 leads a passing drill during @entity1 's final preparations for saturday 's game @entity36 's @entity35 will provide three - quarter from the bench at @entity39 however , @entity1 centre @entity0 , recalled to the starting xv at the expense of the luckless @entity44 , believes that the visitors can upset the odds - but only if they avoid the mistakes made 12 months ago			1
‘ the @entity5 game last year was horrible to look back on , ’ he said			1
‘ it was a terrible overall performance			1
‘ i remember the boys being so fired up for that game and it is funny how we just completely went to pieces			1
‘ we did n’t play rugby at all back then so this weekend it ’s about drip feeding that passion we felt last year but channelled in the wrong way			1
last year , we had boys with tears in their eyes in the dressing room before the game			2
‘ it was an emotionally charged affair , but it ’s a professional sport and it should all be about cool heads			2
‘ there ’s a big focus for us on keeping cool this week because there ’s a fine line between being like that and letting your emotions run away with you and we certainly crossed it in the wrong way last year			2
@entity19 's squad gather for a team huddle at the end of the session at @entity22 ‘ i took that defeat really badly as it was probably the worst one of my career			1
‘ i remember the embarrassment of it all and that defeat has been used as motivation this week			2
there was a lack of structure to our attack , we were all over the place in parts			2
there was poor execution of kicks , poor decision - making , it just looked really disjointed			2
‘ we have watched clips this week and we know there are one or two points to prove			2
’ @entity0 also revealed that , should the @entity10 pull off what some would consider the impossible , they would dedicate the victory to stricken team - mate @entity44			2
the @entity36 centre admitted he was ‘ devastated ’ for his close friend after @entity44 sustained a knee injury that could rule him out of this year ’s @entity104			0
‘ i am sure it will be tough for @entity44 to watch knowing that he was meant to be playing in the match today , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ it would be a massive get well soon present for him from us if we can bring home the @entity8 for him and that is what we will be trying to do			1
‘ there is a feeling in the camp of : “ let ’s do this for him ”			0
in professional rugby , guys do get long - term injuries but ones like @entity44 ’s does bring us closer together in the sense we want to do well for him			0
@entity1 fly half @entity122 ( left ) and full back @entity124 work on their kicking on friday ‘ i was pretty close to @entity44 when he got injured on thursday morning and it was the most innocuous thing as there was nobody near him when he pulled up			1
‘ the way it happened , he must have played it over in his head 100 times as he was extremely unlucky			0
‘ i am devastated for him and sent him a message straight after training saying i hoped it was good news but , unfortunately , it was n’t			0
‘ in this period leading up to the @entity104 you really do n’t want anyone to get any long - term injuries			0
there is a chance he can still make the tournament so i am praying for him to make a speedy recovery			0
’ @entity124 ( second left ) is all smiles ahead of saturday 's @entity8 clash in @entity148 @entity0 , for all his honest sympathy and concern over @entity44 , knows his misfortune has given him a chance of making the no 12 jersey his own from now until the @entity104			1
‘ it has been a tough few months for me personally , not being selected and being injured , ’ he continued			0
‘ now i have a chance to start for @entity1 and want to do my talking on the pitch			1
‘ i had a great run of starting a lot of games for @entity1 earlier in my international career and i was very lucky to do that			1
then got a bad injury and it took me a while to get back to where i was			0
now , i feel i am back to where i was and am ready to fill @entity44 ’s boots and do him proud			0
‘ i am pleased to be starting rather than being on the bench as most rugby players will say it is harder to come off the bench			0
most games i have played professionally i have started , which is the way i like it			0
‘ if you are on the bench you do n’t know if you are coming on in minute one or minute 79 so you are constantly on edge			0
at least this time out i can hit the pace of the game straight away			0

it is *32* years since @entity1 last won at @entity22
@entity1 have lost all three of the @entity13 matches so far this season
some *bookmakers* have @entity19 's side at *9/1* to lift the @entity8
