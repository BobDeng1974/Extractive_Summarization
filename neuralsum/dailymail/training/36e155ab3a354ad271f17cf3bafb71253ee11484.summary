@entity0 admitted @entity2 's golden age was over after they became the first reigning champions to be knocked out of the @entity5 after just two matches			1
the 33 - year - old @entity8 keeper has played a pivotal role in @entity2 's six - year global domination as they won the @entity12 and two @entity13 in 2008 and 2012			2
@entity30 snapped up on a mistake by @entity32 and played in @entity33 who picked out @entity34 with a brilliant centre			0
the @entity36 forward kept his head while @entity2 were losing theirs and neatly sidestepped @entity0 before sliding it home			1
@entity0 , heavily criticised after the @entity29 debacle and fortunate to keep his place , did himself no favours with a double - handed fist at @entity30 's gentle free - kick and the ball dropped to @entity33 who controlled it and then toe - poked back past the keeper to make it 2 - 0			1
afterwards he told @entity50 newspaper as : ' we have a few players who are over 30 , it 's just a shame that this generation had to bow out ( of @entity55 2014 ) in this way			0
' @entity57 blow : @entity34 scores @entity24 's first goal against @entity2 down and out : @entity0 is beaten by @entity33 for @entity24 's second goal support : a dejected @entity0 is consoled by back - up keeper @entity62 one to one : @entity24 goalkeeper @entity63 talks to @entity0 after the game top man : @entity2 keeper @entity0 swaps shirts with @entity24 's @entity63 in the tunnel asked whether ' could this be your last game ? ' , he bowed his head and muttered ' i do n't know , i really do n't know ' before walking off			1
@entity72 said he need to take time to think about his own future and ' what is good for @entity50 football '			2
he said : ' it 's true that when such things happen during a @entity5 or a tournament like this then it has consequences but i do n't want to start thinking about that right now			0
we have time to analyse that and it is not the right time now			0
' there will be time to think and reflect what we are going to do			0
i think this team is good but we have to take a decision about what is good for @entity50 football and that applies to myself as well			0
' first up : @entity0 lifts the trophy after winning the @entity94 in 2008 on top : @entity0 holds the @entity5 after beating @entity29 in 2010 final glory boy : @entity0 lifts the @entity94 trophy after beating @entity99 in @entity101 final video reigning champions out as @entity24 stampede			1
