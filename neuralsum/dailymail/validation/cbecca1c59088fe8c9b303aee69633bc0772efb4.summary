captain of @entity4 at 17 the course of @entity2 ’s life altered on a january morning in 1983			1
the day he lost his six - year - old son			1
his previous existence had been blinkered , revolving around the mainstays of family , football and faith			1
his family was shattered by the death of son @entity14 following a two year battle with acute myeloid leukaemia			1
somehow , the football and faith - subjected to anguished , grief stricken examinations in the months which followed - survived			1
“ i have always believed in @entity21 " reflects @entity22 , sipping fizzy water in a coffee shop in @entity26 's west end			1
“ but what happened to little @entity2 made me angry			1
i wondered how something like that could happen			1
@entity2 wants his book to serve as a legacy for the six - year - old son he lost to leukaemia “ it challenged my faith for a wee spell			1
it challenged how i felt			1
“ there was anger , bitterness , every emotion you might associate with bereavement			2
“ i just could n’t understand why @entity21 had done it			2
even to this day i still ask myself the question			2
” he sought refuge and answers in writing			2
scribbled notes on his experiences and emotions became a habit			2
the outcome of his jottings is ‘ @entity55 , together again ’ , the 59 - year - old ’s first book			1
it features the adventures of @entity60 , the pet name he used for the son lost 32 years ago			1
the memories are undimmed by the passage of time			2
he remembers the awful weather most			2
through the grey clouds and rain enveloping @entity26 ’s @entity71 he grasped for a silver lining			2
“ i always remember my wife and i coming out to the car park after @entity2 died and there being most stunning rainbow i had ever seen			1
“ maybe i was looking for something			2
but the colours were so vibrant , it was stunning			2
to me it was a sign			2
" a committed , church goer he interpreted the rainbow as a token of hope			2
some kind of message from above			2
yet in the months which followed he examined his faith and found it wanting			2
rationalising what kind of kind of @entity21 might take the life of an innocent six - year - old child proved impossible			1
an uneasy , restless peace descended slowly			2
“ listen , after a time faith became a great comfort again			2
you do n’t know where it comes from			2
but when you are in despair your beliefs offer you peace and help when you need it most			2
“ but was that challenged for a time ? yes			2
they say time is a healer			0
you hear that all the time			0
and it probably is to some degree			0
“ but when you lose a child you never ever get over it			0
“ you learn to live with it			0
“ @entity2 died in 1983			1
but every day he is with me in my life			0
“ i feel him all the time in the room			0
“ i can sit with my eyes closed in a quiet space and i do n’t see him			0
but i take comfort from the fact i feel he is there			0
“ it never gets any easier			0
there are times all these years on when i still break down for no reason			0
” former @entity4 captain @entity22 ( right ) in action for his club against @entity130 when religion was no comfort for his loss , professional football filled the void			1
@entity22 was just 24 when his child ’s illness was diagnosed and 26 when he died			1
in the course of two and a half years maturity was thrust upon his shoulders in brutal fashion			0
“ i had been very , very selfish , ” he reflects now			0
“ what the illness of my son did was make me realise there were things in life more important than football			1
“ for 90 minutes you would play and then as soon as the game was over it was ‘ right , i have to get to the hospital			0
’ “ @entity155 , i still played after he died			0
” his career , until then , had been on an upward trajectory			0
he started under sir @entity159 at @entity160 , appointed skipper as a teenager , before a move to @entity164 , where @entity165 was the manager he returned to @entity166 after two years , flirting with a @entity168 cap and winning a @entity171 winners ’ medal in 1987			1
@entity22 managed @entity4 twice and remains a respected , likable figure in @entity174 football			1
his 642 appearances for @entity4 make him a club icon , yet grief took a yard from his legs			1
“ i always tried my best			0
i played in a good @entity4 team with guys like @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 – really good players			1
“ we had good teams , we were in @entity187 and we won a @entity171			0
“ but i had always had a deep desire to be the best player i could be			0
when @entity2 took ill it was n’t the same			1
“ i remember beating @entity130 3 - 1 and things were going great			1
’ “ he had been unwell for a couple of weeks			0
one night he was really bad and i came down for training the next morning and saw he was n’t right			0
“ i went back to the doctor and told him @entity196 had purple spots			0
that ’s when the alarm bells rung			0
“ within minutes of taking him in we were sent to @entity202 ’ hospital			0
“ he had septicaemia , meningitis and then they found the leukaemia			1
“ we spent all our time in @entity208			0
“ in the course of two and a half years we had @entity2 at home for no more than three months			1
” tuesdays and thursdays were spent donating blood to improve the quality of his son ’s remaining days			1
with @entity215 went on to have another boy and a set of twins before the couple went their separate ways			0
a product of the @entity222 before counselling became the fashiom , however , @entity22 found it difficult to express himself beyond the football pitch			1
he was n't the only one			0
“ i remember when little @entity2 died that neighbours and friends did n’t know what to say to us			1
“ they would cross the road because they could n’t deal with it			0
“ i was very conscious of it and later they would explain they did n’t want to cry or break down			0
“ my daughter was nine when it all happened and i regret that i could n’t express my feelings to her either			0
“ the little soul was left to cope because i could n’t speak about it			0
“ it occurred to me then that a book might be a way of breaking down the barrier			1
” @entity248 , the star of ‘ @entity55 , together again ’ , dedicates himself to pursuing peace on earth while adressing the themes of grief , loss and the rainbow which appeared over @entity208 in january 83			1
. @entity22 concedes that writing was also a form of catharsis			1
his way of finding some inner peace			0
“ people feel their grief in different ways , ” he admits			0
“ i ’m not educated in any way , but i started to jot down ideas about @entity60 and that developed			0
“ i waited a long time – but this was the right time			0
i had a huge urge to do it			0
” an initial print run of 1000 books , with professional illustrations , cost money and when it sells out @entity22 will use the funds to print more			1
further stories of @entity60 ’s travails bulge from notebooks in his @entity26 home and the @entity279 branch closest to @entity166 have agreed to stock the book aimed at 7 - 11 year olds			1
“ i did it for @entity196 , ” explains @entity22			1
“ listen , he was a normal wee boy – he could be a wee nightmare at times like any child			0
“ but he made a big impact on a lot of people in a short time			0
and more than anything i want this book to serve as his legacy			1
” ‘ @entity55 ; @entity293 ’ by @entity2 is available from @entity292			1
