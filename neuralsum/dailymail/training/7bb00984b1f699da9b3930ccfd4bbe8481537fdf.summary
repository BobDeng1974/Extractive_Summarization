@entity1 manager @entity0 admits he has been surprised how quickly striker @entity2 has found his feet in @entity4			1
@entity2 , a summer signing from @entity7 side @entity6 , now has five goals in as many games after finding the target in the 2 - 0 defeat of @entity12			1
@entity14 's own goal had given @entity1 the lead at @entity16 , setting them on the way to a win which means they head into the international break in good shape			1
@entity2 takes the plaudits after scoring @entity1 's second goal in their 2 - 0 win over @entity12 the @entity26 international striker leaps to head home with @entity12 goalkeeper @entity28 stranded @entity0 said : ' i would have seen @entity2 as being a player , coming from the @entity7 second division , playing maybe 10 to 15 games for us and finding out about the @entity34			1
' but he is so desperate to do well and his runs are so good at the opposition 's defences and he seems to have the knack - and that 's the hardest knack of all - of turning up in the right place at the right time			1
' so that 's fantastic for him and absolutely outstanding business for us at @entity1			1
' in contrast , @entity44 has little to smile about with his @entity12 team bottom of the @entity34			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 is delighted with @entity2 's contribution so far this season the west @entity49 side made a number of high - profile signings in the summer but the team 's big names have failed to deliver results so far this season			1
@entity57 pundit @entity56 described the visitors ' attitude as ' diabolical ' after the game but @entity44 refused to criticise his players ' commitment			0
the 67 - year - old said : ' we need to get them fitter			2
i 've put a lot of faith into @entity68			0
unfortunately he 's had an injury and we need to get him fit			0
' when he 's fit he 's a fantastic player - i had him at @entity70 , he 's an excellent player - but at the moment he 's short of fitness			2
' the doctor came to me at half - time and told me he can only play another 15 minutes - i need players who can play 90 minutes			2
@entity44 admitted that @entity68 ( right ) is lacking fitness after substituting the midfielder ' they 've had injuries and missed training - we need to get everyone fit and ready to go			2
' @entity44 's side face a tough run of fixtures after the international break with @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 to come in the next four games			2
when asked if the players were letting him down with their disappointing displays , @entity44 said : ' i do n't think so			0
we 're short - we 're short of goals , we 're short up front			0
' it 's been difficult , we lost @entity96 on the deadline and could n't get a replacement			0
we 've had a tough start but there 's an awful long way to go			0
' we 're not going to give up are we ? it 's early days			0
we have to find a way of playing that suits everybody and get the best out of what we 've got			0
