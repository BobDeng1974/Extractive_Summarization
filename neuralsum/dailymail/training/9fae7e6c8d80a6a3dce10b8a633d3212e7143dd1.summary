global warming has been blamed for polar bears straying into residential areas to scavenge for food in recent years - but strolling through downtown @entity4 seems a stretch too far			2
as does this polar bears placid nature , as it ambles on a leash across a pedestrian crossing at the @entity10			2
footage of the bear and its female handler - a blond in a short skirt - has spread across social media in @entity16 as debate has raged about whether the bear is real or not , and just why it is out for a walk			2
nevertheless , the debate over whether the polar bear was real or not , did nothing to quell excitement about the unusual happening , or speculation around what the stunt might be promoting			1
the most popular theory was that it was a pr stunt for @entity55 , however , others suggested it was to promote everything from ice cream and cosmetics through to global warming			1
all that was known was that the woman and the men involved were wearing t - shirts with the words ' @entity64 ' printed on them			0
it is not known what , if anything , the stunt is promoting but lash say all will be revealed later this month the lash organisation pose for pictures with the collared polar bear , as onlookers take pictures a picture from the lash organisation 's @entity78 page , which shows its members who have not been identifed the group has a @entity78 page which was set up in march , and shows photos of the polar bear being walked in @entity85 where it caused an equal amount of hysteria			1
the page , offers little insight into what the organisation is about , but a post says ' all will be revealed ' in @entity93 on october 24			0
as well as pictures of the polar bear , the page also shows those linked to the organisation dressed up in shirts printed with their logo			1
polar bears are not known to be friendly to humans			0
in the past 20 years , six people have been killed by the animals in @entity105 alone and recent studies have suggested that attacks are on the rise			0
climate change has been sighted as one of the main causes , as the bears are forced to roam further to find food .			0

the polar bear was walked across @entity116 in @entity4
it was being walked by a @entity31 organisation called @entity32
onlookers *wondered* if it was a pr stunt for @entity55
