@entity1 's face lit up and his mouth pulled into a wide small as he fell to his knees after placing a shot past @entity5			0
the @entity7 winger looked like a child who had just woken up on christmas day , understandable considering his 30 - yard run in behind @entity11 's defence to slot the equaliser for @entity13 beyond @entity5 had just rocked the @entity15 winners			1

pride : @entity27 could have played for @entity80 , @entity81 or @entity68 but grew up supporting @entity13 his older brother became a doctor , who raps in his spare time			1
you 'd expect nothing less in the @entity27 household			2
he could 've played for @entity80 , @entity81 or @entity68 , but always supported @entity13 as a child so it was a no - brainer when he received a call - up in 2013			2
it sounds as if he bucks the trend then ? he certainly does			0
@entity27 is a deeply religious @entity96 and believes that marks him out from many other professional footballers			2

i do n’t get ahead of myself			0
on the move : @entity27 joined @entity7 in 2012 after spells in non-league and abroad in @entity52 ' i accept everything that happens to me in life and that helps to keep me stable			1
' i ’m a bit different from most players			0
if you talk to my team - mates they ’ll all say that			2
it ’s a good different though			0
it ’s good to have variety with a different outlook on life compared to the cliched footballer			0
' what 's he like as a player ? @entity125 : @entity27 is quick , as he showed in his well - taken goal against @entity11 , but also has technical ability @entity27 is a rapid flank man – aptly demonstrated by his burst of pace from the left flank to take him through on goal against @entity133 on sunday night			1
at @entity7 he was taught to play as a wing - back in a 3 - 5 - 2 formation by @entity49 , as opposed to an out - and - out winger where he featured for @entity13			1
