by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 06:03 est , 27 april 2013 it is hoped the @entity3 fiver will come to be known as a ' @entity4 ' when the note bears the image of the country 's greatest wartime prime minister			1
the @entity9 has announced that sir @entity4 will become the first politician of the modern era to feature on a banknote when the new design is issued in 2016			1
unveiling the design at @entity16 , @entity4 's former home in @entity17 , governor sir @entity14 said : ' perhaps the note will become known as a @entity4			1
' scroll down for audio of speech honour : @entity21 sir @entity4 is to appear on the new £ 5 note from 2016 , the @entity9 has announced his sentiments were echoed by the politician 's grandson , mid-sussex @entity26 mp @entity24 , who was at the ceremony along with other members of @entity4 's family			1
asked whether he thought the nickname would catch on , mr @entity24 said : ' of course it will			0
' we are all going to go to @entity34 and be buying our groceries with @entity36 , and that of course would have given him more pleasure than anything			0
' the design will feature a renowned portrait of the prime minister in defiant pose , taken by photographer @entity45 in december 1941			1
behind him is a view of the houses of @entity49 , with the hands on @entity51 showing three o'clock			0
governor sir @entity14 made the announcement during an event at @entity16 , @entity4 's former home in @entity17 , attended by members of his family			1
it reflects the approximate time of a statement to the @entity60 on may 13 1940 when he famously told @entity61 : ' i have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears and sweat			1
' the quote itself is also shown on the design			0
hero : sir @entity4 is regarded as the man who saved @entity3 from the clutches of @entity75 's @entity74 a background image shows the @entity77 for literature , with citation , awarded in 1953 to @entity4 - who apart from being a politician was a prolific historical writer			1
sir @entity14 said : ' our banknotes acknowledge the life and work of great @entity3			1
sir @entity4 was a truly great @entity3 leader , orator and writer			1
above that , he remains a hero of the entire free world			0
' his energy , courage , eloquence , wit and public service are an inspiration to us all			0
i am proud to announce that he will appear on our next banknote			0
' @entity4 's image replaces that of @entity104 , the philanthropist and penal reformer , who appears on current notes first issued in 2002			1
these will be phased out over two or three years , leaving no notes featuring the face of a famous woman - other than the @entity111			0
the choice of @entity4 reflects the fact that , though a political figure , he is widely revered across the spectrum as the man who saved @entity3 in its darkest hour from the fearful advance of @entity119 across @entity120			1
another war hero , the @entity122 , is the only other prime minister to have featured on a banknote image - the old £ 5 phased out in the 1990s			1
@entity4 had a long parliamentary career during which he served as home secretary and chancellor before a spell in the political wilderness in the 1930s when he warned of the increasing threat of @entity132 rearmament			2
honour : in front of a portrait of the great man at his @entity16 home in @entity17 , @entity14 , the governor of the @entity9 hands the design to @entity140 , the only surviving child of sir @entity4 in may 1940 , he replaced @entity142 as prime minister in the newly - formed @entity144			1
his leadership and brilliant oratory were credited with helping to steer @entity3 to victory			2
after war broke out sir @entity4 became prime minister , replacing @entity142 and leading the newly - formed @entity144			1
as the country faced ' an ordeal of the most grievous kind ' , the ' @entity153 ' , as the @entity154 called him , stood up in the @entity155 on may 13 1940 and gave one of his most famous speeches , declaring : ' i have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears and sweat '			1
these were the same words he had used when he met his cabinet for the first time earlier that day			0
he concluded with : ' come then , let us go forward together with our united strength			0
' both are examples of the brilliance of his oratory			0
@entity4 became a patriotic icon , exemplar of leadership and a national inspiration during the @entity177			2
defeated in the post-victory 1945 general election , he argued strongly for @entity181 unity against the threat of @entity183			0
he was returned to office in 1951 and finally retired in 1955 , aged 80			0
aged 90 , he died on the morning of sunday january 24 , 1965			0
defeated by @entity185 in the 1945 general election , he served again as prime minister from 1951 to 1955 , when he retired aged 80			2
@entity4 died in 1965 and was given a full state funeral , the first commoner to receive such an honour since @entity191 in 1898			2
he was also the first commoner to feature on a @entity3 coin - the 1965 crown or five - shilling piece			2
speaking in the grounds of @entity16 , sir @entity4 's grandson , @entity198 @entity26 mp @entity24 , said featuring on a bank note would have given the former wartime prime minister great pleasure			1
he said : ' he was an extraordinary man and his ability to capture the mood and the people 's mood was one of his great gifts as a statesman			2
' the design of the bank note , the quotation and the whole idea behind it is so appropriate and fitting , and my grandfather would have been truly very proud			0
' asked why it had taken so long for sir @entity4 to feature on a bank note , mr @entity14 said he is the most recent figure to appear on any note			1
he said : ' normally we allow a much longer period of time to elapse before we are willing to make a judgment			0
' i think @entity4 is a very obvious figure and i was very proud , as one of my last acts as governor , to put him on a bank note			2
' we do n't put many figures on			0
' the first historical figure to appear on a bank note was only in 1970			0
' we have only had 15 since so there are not many opportunities to make this decision and @entity4 is only the second figure from the @entity235			2

great prime minister is the first politician of modern era to receive honour
image is from 1941 , as he led @entity3 in fight against @entity75 's @entity74
will *include* quote : ' i have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears and sweat '
