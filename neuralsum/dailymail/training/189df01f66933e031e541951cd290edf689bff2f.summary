by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 31 august 2013 updated : 03:08 est , 2 september 2013 au naturelle : @entity2 is thought to have chosen teardrop - shaped implants for her second operation evolutionary theorists call them ‘ sexual ornaments ’			2
according to academics , the human female bosom is unique among primates			2
while ape species have large breasts only during lactation , the same is n’t true for us			1
and as they remain after menopause , they are not an indicator of fertility			2
so , look away now feminists ... the way they look mainly serves to attract a mate			2
thus , women have always drawn attention to their busts with padding , corsetry , or simply by going topless			2
today , the boob job is the most commonly performed cosmetic surgery , with more than 10,000 @entity32 women having one last year			1
and as @entity35 reported last week , @entity32 breast implant manufacturer @entity33 claim one in ten patients now opts for a ‘ super boob job , ’ increasing their bust by four or more cup sizes in a single operation			1
however , many women still want a more discreet option dubbed the ‘ has she or has n’t she ’ boob job			2
@entity45 , a plastic surgeon and co-author of the @entity48 , says : ‘ @entity2 epitomises the new trend			1
' she has never admitted to surgery , but pictures show her breasts are incredibly supple and full – better than in her youth			1
’ despite technological and surgical advances , there are still pitfalls when trying to choose the perfect pair			1
here , experts advise how to get it just right			1
@entity60 size is dictated by the volume of the implant and measured in cubic centimetres ( a 151cc to 250cc implant will give around a one to two - cup size increase )			1
if you are looking for a natural - looking boob job , consultant plastic surgeon @entity68 recommends forgetting about cup size altogether			1
‘ do n’t come in saying , “ i am a b and i ’d like to be a @entity73 ”			2
@entity75 size is highly subjective			1
i might see 20 women measuring @entity73 , all with completely different breasts , ’ he explains			1
ultimately you want a breast which is in proportion and the right implant that will achieve that			1
the perfect shape in 2011 , @entity68 analysed the mathematical factors of attractive breasts , using 100 page 3 models , all of whom had real breasts , as research material			1
the resulting formula revealed a template for both surgeons and women considering surgery : 45 per cent of breast volume is above the nipple ; the nipple points upwards at an average angle of 20 degrees ; the upper half is either straight or concave , and the lower half a neat , full curve			1
back in the days : there was no mistaking that @entity2 had a boob job eight years ago , but later had her ' chest oranges ' , right , swapped for a more natural looking implant @entity68 says : ‘ the dimensions are a template , whether you are simply enlarging or lifting as well			0
’ that said , the desire is normally to have bigger breasts			1
if you want a natural - looking boob job which is aesthetically ideal , there are limitations depending on your frame and anatomy			0
‘ the surgeon ought to measure the width of your breast to select the implant size , ’ he says			1
too big a width means the implant shows on top of the rib cage			0
‘ as long as you stick to this rule you are close to achieving the perfect shape			1
too large will never look natural			0
’ project yourself ‘ projection , or pertness , of the breasts is down to the shape of the implant itself , ’ says consultant plastic surgeon @entity133			1
‘ there are different silhouettes – low , medium , high or extra-high			0
’ ‘ the patient ’s physiology must be taken into account			0
a 20 - year - old with a flat chest could n’t have an extra high projection as the skin would be too stretched , ’ @entity141 adds			0
‘ under - filling is equally disastrous as it will make the skin sag around the implant , ’ says @entity68			0
‘ @entity153 , you may have a deflated breast			1
the more skin laxity , the more projection is necessary			0
’ another important consideration is breast tissue and skin quality			2
‘ older or post-pregnancy skin may be very thin , ’ says @entity68			0
‘ you do n’t want the implant to show underneath			0
’ rounding up a round shape accounts for 82 per cent of implants in @entity32			1
the other option is a teardrop - shaped implant			0
@entity133 explains : ‘ the round implant looks fuller at the top , while the teardrop slopes downwards like a natural breast			2
‘ not many people have the teardrop because the surgical technique has to be very precise to avoid the implant rotating within the breast			2
it takes longer in theatre and the implant itself costs more , so the option is more expensive			0
’ there can be a £ 1,000 difference			0
popular op : more than 10,000 @entity32 women had plastic surgery on their chest last year @entity189 some surgeons offer 3d imaging , but usually surgeons suggest ‘ trying out ’ new breasts by wearing a larger bra filled with an implant			1
‘ @entity32 women want fullness at the top , or the @entity200 effect , ’ says @entity68			1
‘ but if the breasts stay that shape when naked , they ’ll look a bit weird			2
this means limiting volume in the upper bust			0
you can still wear an enhancing bra afterwards			0
’ safety first ‘ women should be as informed as possible about exactly what goes into their bodies , ’ says consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon @entity210			2
the most important factor is not the type of implant , but the safety record			0
@entity220 legislation is n’t particularly stringent , but the @entity222 regulator , the @entity221 ( @entity221 ) , has approved five brands of implant			0
‘ should your surgeon not suggest one with @entity221 approval then there ought to be good safety data demonstrated in the form of long - term clinical follow - ups of a minimum of five years , looking at the integrity of the implant and effects on the body , ’ says @entity45			0
a boob job is for life ‘ the body forms scar tissue around the implant			0
this fibrous bag usually starts to contract after a decade , and the breast may look unnatural			2
if it becomes unevenly shaped it may have ruptured , ’ says @entity45			0
however , as long as you have a decent implant there are no serious concerns should this happen			0
‘ women often only find out about rupture when they go for a mammogram at 50 , ’ he adds			0
once you know they ’re broken , they ought to be removed			0
many women need reductions too			0
‘ this is why a size eight woman wanting to have massive breasts is going to be in trouble , ’ says @entity141			1
‘ the breast tissue will be very thin and when they are replaced she may be left with sagging breasts			1

a breast enlargement is the most common plastic surgery in @entity32
before an op there are several things to consider , not just size
