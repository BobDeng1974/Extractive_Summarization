mr @entity35 said : ‘ failure to make a note of the second part of the consultation on december 30 speaks volumes about how seriously dr @entity9 was treating patient a on that day			1
‘ it is inconceivable that had he had things he should have at the forefront of his mind , quite how serious @entity41 ’s condition was on december 30 , it is inconceivable that he would have omitted and forgot to make a note			2

‘ secondly that the @entity36 ’s case comes to this : the expert evidence relied upon by the @entity36 tells you that dr @entity9 should have done the things that are the subject matter of the allegations			0
‘ we say that expert evidence is not only flawed in and of itself , but that on scrutiny it must be wrong			0

this was a three minute appointment in which , as the note reveals , very little was done			0
’ dr @entity10 claims that his treatment was adequate , despite the lack of notes			1
‘ despite the inadequacy of the notes you can track his thinking and record that he has taken the right steps and made the right diagnoses , ’ said @entity142 , defending the doctor			0
‘ he accepted his shortcomings			0
he was accepting of his naivety about matters after the death , ’ he added			0

@entity165 , defending dr @entity11 , said : ‘ the failure was in not having a sufficient degree of the seriousness of these diagnoses , not whether they were considered or not			0
’ the fitness practise panel must first make decisions on the facts of the case before going on to decide if any of their actions amount to misconduct			0
if any of the doctors ’ fitness to practise is found impaired they could face sanctions on their registration , which include conditions , suspension or , in the most serious of cases , being struck off the medical register			2
