by @entity0 @entity1 is targeting an extended stay in the @entity4 side following his successful return to the the fold this summer			1
the 25 - year - old bowling all - rounder played the final three @entity9 against @entity10 , helping @entity4 to win all three and clinch a 3 - 1 series victory despite having trailed 1 - 0 after two matches			1
four wickets in the final match at the @entity15 seemed to justify his selection following two quiet tests , and @entity1 believes he is finally settling into the international fold			1
the @entity20 : @entity1 celebrates taking a wicket at @entity15 @entity1 said : ' i had a taste of @entity24 last summer against @entity25 and it helped me to improve as a player			1
' i did ok last year but i think i have improved as a cricketer in the mean time and come back stronger			2
' i have added more pace in my bowling and i think my game has moved up a level to when i first broke into the @entity4 team			2
' the right - arm fast - medium bowler is highly - regarded within the @entity4 set - up , yet he faces stiff competition for places in an ever - evolving line - up			2
@entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and the once - again selectable @entity43 are just some of the players vying for a spot in the test side			1
and , with @entity4 not playing another @entity24 until they tour the @entity47 in march , @entity20 may have a little time to wait yet to fully cement his place in the side			1
' it is a fresh squad in many ways and i am happy to be a part of it			0
it 's all a blur : @entity20 ( centre ) has put on a yard of pace since his test debut last year appealing trait : @entity20 implores the umpire to give @entity62 ( left ) out - which he does well done : @entity20 is congratulated by @entity4 captain @entity63 after victory at @entity15 ' we have n't got a test for a while now which is a little frustrating but i aim to be involved once they do come back round again			1
' playing for @entity4 is what we all aim for as county cricketers			2
having been in and out of the squad for few years now it was nice to get a run in the test team towards the end of the summer			0
delighted : @entity77 after the @entity15 win ' i got myself one or two important wickets - and a few runs here and there - and so i feel pretty good about how i contributed to the side			0
' we played some really good cricket as a team and , when you win a @entity4 series , it is a great feeling			0
playing test cricket for @entity4 is the pinnacle			2
i am just delighted i am able to say i was a part of such a fantastic victory in the series against @entity10			0
' the @entity94 bowler - who will feature for the county under their limited - overs name the @entity98 at the @entity100 finals day at @entity101 on saturday - first appeared on the international scene in the shorter form of the game in january 2011			1
and , with 13 odis and five international @entity106 behind him , @entity20 is keen to be involved in the one - day side of things over the coming months ahead of the @entity110 in @entity25 and @entity111 next year			1
' it 's nice to be included in the squad for the @entity115 series , especially with so much one - day cricket coming up in the next year			0
' it 's a huge achievement to be involved in any international squad so i am very pleased			0
' obviously i hope to be going to the @entity110 in 2015 , so there 's that little added incentive too			0
' @entity1 was speaking at a @entity100 branch ahead of @entity123 this saturday			1
@entity100 are proud sponsors of @entity125 cricket from grassroots to the top of the professional game			0
