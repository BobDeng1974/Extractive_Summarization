by @entity0 ' fobbing off ' : @entity1 , the government 's @entity2 criticised the police response to yobbish behaviour police are fobbing off sufferers of anti-social behaviour by asking them to write a diary of their experiences instead of taking action , the @entity7 ’ commissioner said last night			1
@entity1 said those targeted by yobs were ‘ living in fear ’ and needed officers to take action			1
she claimed police had not learned from the deaths of victims @entity24 and @entity26			1
mrs @entity24 killed herself and her disabled daughter in 2007 by setting fire to their car after officers ignored a campaign of terror against them			1

@entity1 – whose husband @entity46 was killed by a drunken mob outside their home in @entity50 , @entity51 , in 2007 – said she struggled to make police understand that anti-social behaviour was serious and victims needed proper support			1
she added : ‘ do n’t just give them a diary to fill in , because that ’s an irritant in itself			0
if you ’re being really traumatised you have n’t got the energy to fill it in			2
‘ we have to learn lessons of @entity24 , we have to learn the lessons of @entity26			1
you do n’t learn any more lessons by losing somebody else			0

’ she also dismissed a new law known as the ‘ community trigger ’ that forces police to respond after someone makes three complaints in six months			0
' learn the lessons ' : @entity1 said police must take into account examples like @entity24 , left , who killed herself after police ignored her plight , and @entity26 , right , who was killed by youths he confronted over the havoc they caused outside his house she said : ‘ actually it ’s about the first call			1
you do not wait for three			0
anti-social behaviour is n’t a low - level crime			0
@entity46 died from anti-social behaviour – and then it was a murder			0
’ mr @entity96 was set upon by a gang of up to 15 youths when he went to remonstrate with them for causing havoc outside the family ’s home			1
he died two days later in hospital and three teenagers were convicted of his murder			0
