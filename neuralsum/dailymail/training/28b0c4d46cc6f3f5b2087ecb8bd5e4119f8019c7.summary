@entity0 was escorted into @entity2 's stadium by @entity4 ' agent on friday night after being alerted to a contract stand - off between the @entity7 midfielder and his @entity9 bosses			1
@entity9 striker @entity10 and @entity2 midfielder @entity11 were believed to be the two main points of interest for the @entity15 manager when he booked his seat at @entity17 for the @entity19 fixture , which the visitors won 2 - 0			1
but while both are under review at @entity23 , @entity4 has dramatically emerged as a viable target after his representative @entity25 , from the @entity27 agency , met @entity0 and coaches @entity28 and @entity30 and sat with them at the game			1
hard worker : @entity15 manager @entity0 with @entity4 ' agent ( right ) in @entity7 @entity4 is just 24 but already has 41 appearances for @entity7 under his belt			1
joining as a youngster from @entity37 in 2006 , @entity4 has flourished into a pass master in @entity9 's star - studded midfield			1
alongside @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 or any of @entity9 's other superstars , @entity4 can pull the strings , drifting into the space behind the forward - thinking @entity46 , @entity10 , @entity47 and @entity48			1
fans of @entity50 wo n't remember @entity4 's last visit to @entity52 too fondly , when he played all 90 minuted of the humbling 3 - 1 @entity54 win at the @entity55 earlier this season			2
@entity4 was also instrumental when @entity9 performed a similar feat against @entity58 last campaign			2
he bagged the first goal in the 3 - 1 win at the @entity62			0
at 24 and with a stack of @entity7 caps to his name , @entity4 is a perfect fit for the area of @entity15 's team in most urgent need of improvement , and the @entity7 midfielder could be prised away after stalling over a new deal at the @entity73			2
his current deal runs out at the end of next season , and @entity9 chief executive @entity77 admitted : ' it is always about money in every agreement , and talks have so far failed to lead to a new contract for @entity4			1
we are interested in prolonging his stay with us			0
' @entity9 would doubtless ask at least £ 25million for @entity4 , but @entity15 have illustrated their willingness to spend big by agreeing a £ 37m fee for @entity88 's @entity87			2
@entity9 are also hoping to open contract talks with @entity10 , but @entity15 will be heartened by news of a fall - out between the free - scoring striker and coach @entity93			1
@entity10 , whose contract runs until 2016 , was evidently accused of lacking enthusiasm in training and axed from the squad for friday night 's game			2
‘ @entity10 could pack his bags , ' said club legend @entity100			0
' i see @entity102 in the attack , his playing style is suited for ( @entity106 ) @entity93 's ideas than that of @entity108			0
‘ there are even more reasons why he could leave - even without him , @entity93 could still count on @entity46 and @entity111 in attack			0
’ raconteur ? @entity0 ( left ) shares a joke with former @entity9 manager @entity114 ( centre ) deep in discussion ? @entity0 knows he needs to strengthen his squad before the end of january incoming ? @entity2 striker @entity119 ( left ) is interesting @entity15 but @entity9 's @entity120 ( right ) is n't significant lead : @entity9 's victory took them 10 points clear at the top of the @entity19 the goalscorers : @entity46 ( right ) and @entity111 ( second left ) were again key for @entity9 as for the match itself , @entity46 set up one goal and scored a penalty to help the @entity19 leaders go 10 points clear as the league resumed after the winter break			1
despite the absence of key players , including the injured @entity48 and @entity40 , @entity9 picked up where they left off in december to stretch their unbeaten run to 42 consecutive league games			0
after a nervous opening spell in which third - placed @entity2 squandered a golden chance , @entity9 , who have now won their last nine league games , settled and came close when @entity111 's shot scraped the post			1
@entity111 started in a lone striker role after @entity10 was dropped from the squad for not having trained well , according to sports director @entity145			0
he soon had better luck when @entity46 raced down the right wing and cut the ball back for his @entity7 team mate to drill into the net for the lead after seven minutes			0
@entity2 were constantly on the backfoot against a @entity9 side who never hit top speed but controlled possession , using defender @entity157 as a holding midfielder while @entity159 @entity42 orchestrated the game			2
the hosts did come close twice on the stroke of half - time with @entity9 goalkeeper @entity164 palming a @entity119 shot on to the post and denying @entity166 from close range			0
@entity46 got on the scoresheet eight minutes after the restart , converting a penalty to condemn @entity2 to their first home defeat of the campaign before the hosts hit the woodwork again through @entity174			0
on saturday , second - placed @entity175 , on 37 points , are in action at lowly @entity178 while @entity179 , fourth with 32 , host mid-table @entity180			0
@entity2 are third on 33			0
hitting the target ? @entity119 ( centre ) could strengthen @entity15 's attacking options looking to impress ? @entity11 hit the post during his side 's defeat by @entity9 left out : @entity10 ( left ) could leave @entity9 when @entity102 arrives ball winner : @entity41 ( left ) would provide @entity15 's defence with a much - needed midfield anchor			1

@entity0 in @entity7 for @entity2 v @entity9
interested in @entity10 and @entity192 's @entity11
but @entity4 has emerged as target *due* to contract stand - off
@entity9 chief @entity77 *stresses* desire to keep @entity7 star
