@entity1 skipper @entity0 has admitted he felt lost arriving back for pre season training without former vice captain @entity3 - and he does n't like seeing the @entity5 legend in a sky blue kit either			1
@entity3 has moved onto pastures new since his @entity9 contract expired - and began training with @entity10 this week as he spends six months at @entity1 's @entity12 title rivals before heading for @entity13			1
but @entity0 found that move - and @entity20 's @entity14 switch - tough to take having spent years playing alongside the veteran pair for club and country only for the trio to now be completely split up			1
' at @entity42 is next door to me and @entity44 is a couple up			0
' we 've grown up together and won and lost here at @entity1 and done many great things so i was very sad to see them go			2
' and to see @entity44 already sign for @entity14 and @entity3 has signed for @entity31 ... it does n't seem right to me seeing them in different shirts			2
maybe over time that will ease but it does n't seem right , ' he told @entity54			0
old guard : skipper @entity0 has lost @entity3 and @entity20 to pastures new this summer ready to go : @entity0 spoke to @entity54 about starting the new campaign without his old friends pleased to still be here : @entity0 got another one year deal at @entity9 , unlike @entity20 and @entity3 passion : @entity1 could miss @entity3 's influence in midfield - which is of course @entity10 's gain ' he 's been an idol and someone i aspire to be in training , around the place , off the field			1
he was a great character but footballing wise i 've never met someone who works as hard as he does on the field to improve his game			0
' to do what he has done at the club ... for me there 's no one better			0
@entity3 has been an absolute legend at this football club and his legacy will remain forever			2
' this club is evolving			0
one day we 'll all be gone			0
' @entity5 : @entity3 and @entity0 have held the captaincy and vice captaincy through @entity1 's success legacy : @entity0 does n't think anyone will ever match @entity3 's achievements at @entity1 unwinding : the @entity1 skipper took some time out to watch the new @entity91 film with his wife @entity92			1

@entity0 and @entity3 spent 13 years at @entity9 together
now the @entity1 skipper has lost his vice captain to @entity10
@entity3 is spending six months in @entity97 before moving to @entity31
left back @entity20 has also departed for @entity14 after a long spell with the @entity5
@entity0 says @entity3 was his idol in training and that he leaves a legacy
but now the midfielder will pass on his experience to @entity10 's *youngsters*
@entity0 says @entity1 are evolving as a club and one day he too will go
