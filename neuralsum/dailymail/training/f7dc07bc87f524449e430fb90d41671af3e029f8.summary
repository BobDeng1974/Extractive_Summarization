@entity1 lawyer @entity0 , 47 , who is set to play @entity2 , said the @entity1 dictator was the real hero of @entity4 , despite suffering a crushing defeat it is not so much a bid to rewrite history as a blatant attempt at match - rigging			1
for the @entity1 are claiming that @entity2 – not @entity11 – was the true hero of @entity4			1
in a reconstruction to mark this year ’s bicentenary of the battle , they plan to ignore the fact that he emerged utterly defeated			0
instead , they want to portray the @entity1 emperor as the winner over a ‘ frightful ’ @entity22 nobody			1
but the sabre - rattling ahead of the commemorations in @entity25 this summer was quickly dismissed by historians			0
the first salvo was fired by @entity1 lawyer @entity0 , who will play @entity2 in the re-enactment			1
the 47 - year - old , taking massive liberties with history , claimed that while @entity2 was ‘ one of the greatest men the world has ever known ’ , the @entity11 – who led the @entity36 army to a famous victory – was a ‘ frightful @entity38 that no one has heard of ’			1

' @entity2 was a dictator whose actions caused the death of hundreds of thousands			2
@entity11 was merely trying to stop a murderous despot from taking over @entity64			0
‘ there ’s no question @entity2 ’s stature and influence in the world was enormous			2
but it could be argued his legacy to @entity1 has not been 100 per cent helpful , whereas on the back of @entity11 we became the greatest empire the world has ever known			2
’ taking large liberties with historical fact , mr @entity0 claimed @entity2 was ' one of the greatest men the world has ever known ' , while @entity78 was ' a frightful @entity38 no one has heard of ' @entity80 , professor of military history at the @entity81 , said the @entity1 disdain for @entity11 – ‘ one of the two or three greatest generals in history ’ – may be because he was leading an allied army containing not only @entity88 but also @entity89 and @entity87			1
