by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 06:54 est , 6 december 2012 one of only two prototypes of the very first magnetic strip credit cards developed by @entity3 is up for sale for the first time			1
@entity6 's are offering the relic of financial history for sale at their @entity11 branch , with an estimate of between $ 10,000 to $ 15,000			0
made of card , with its magnetic strips printed stuck somewhat askew across both sides , the card has been carried for nearly 50 years in the wallet of its developer @entity20			2
relic of financial history : this unassuming oblong of brown card is one of only two of the original prototypes of the modern day credit card developed by @entity3 in the late @entity29 credited with making possible today 's trillion dollar consumer credit industry , the card is a unique piece of financial history			1
while credit cards for individual companies had been in use in the @entity38 since the @entity39 , it was only in the @entity40 that the idea of a universal credit card came into general use and acceptance			1
however , these raised letter cards required extensive customer service and substantial time to process			0
seeking to create an application that would increase computer sales , @entity3 set about transforming the raised letter credit card to make it more efficient			1
going under the hammer : the card is available for sale at @entity6 at an auction set for december 14 , with an estimate of between £ 10,000 and $ 15,000 also going under the hammer in the same auction as the @entity3 prototype credit card is this complete microfilm bible , thought to be the very first book to make it to the moon			1
one of 100 tiny good books carried aboard @entity66 on behalf of the @entity67 , the microfilm comes complete with a letter of certification signed by @entity66 astronaut @entity70 and @entity71 of the prayer league 's ' @entity72 '			0
@entity75 ’s weight restrictions prohibited the transport of a convention book to the moon so in lieu of a large heavy codex , so microfilm was used to condense the 1,245 page @entity83 version into the tiny 1.5in square			0
@entity70 carried the microform bibles aboard the lunar module @entity88 , which landed on the @entity89 of the @entity90 on february 5 , 1971			0
the company 's @entity91 , headed by mr @entity93 and @entity94 , settled on magnetic tape as the only convenient data storage method capable of easily accessing the necessary alphanumeric information			2
once the engineers decided on magnetic tape , the biggest challenge was designing a durable , inexpensive card			2
the earliest trials were done on cardboard , but quick progress with the invention meant that only two such prototypes were made before the plastic card was developed			0
' @entity3 did the work for free and did n’t even patent the machine - readable card it came up with , ' mr @entity93 said			1
' rather , it offered its solution gratis to all , assuming that the more transactions conducted using machine - readable media , the more computers would be sold to process them			0
' the strategy worked beyond anyone ’s dreams			0
' @entity119 in 1970 became the first company to take up @entity3 's new design , issuing 250,000 plastic magnetic strip cards which for the first time allowed customers to transact directly with banks and airport kiosks			1
consumers and the rest of the banks quickly adopted the idea and , by last year , more than 20billion credit card transactions were recorded in the @entity38 alone			1
mr @entity20 ' prototype card goes on sale december 14 as part of a fine books and manuscripts sale at @entity6 in @entity11			0
on one side the magnetic strip has come away and been stuck back down with sellotape , but it is not thought to have affected the value of the almost unique item			2
the only other example is kept at the @entity142 in @entity143 .			2

one of only two in *existence* - the other is held in @entity143 's @entity142
@entity3 team came up with the idea of using the magnetic strip to speed up the processing of credit card transactions
this example has been kept in the wallet of the design team leader ever since the late @entity29
