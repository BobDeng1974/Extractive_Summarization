@entity0 and @entity1 have no plans , no agenda , no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry – the couple simply has a dream to ‘ discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time			1
’ and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in @entity15 , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can			1
@entity17 , 27 , and @entity18 @entity1 , 31 , who met in @entity19 in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open - ended odyssey on the road			1
in 356 days so far they ’ve covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries			2
@entity1 , 31 , takes in her surrounds as she and @entity0 take a break in their cycle journey around the world @entity17 , 27 , and @entity1 , 31 , stop for a picture in @entity34 , one of the 16 countries they 've been through since leaving @entity36 last year @entity18 @entity1 sets up camp , the most common means of accommodation for her and @entity17 , on the stunning @entity40 in @entity41 @entity1 points at the winding road that she and @entity17 had climb in @entity44 's @entity43 with their 130kg of gear ( including bicycles ) with no plans or agenda , @entity1 and @entity17 are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the @entity54 @entity53 in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre			1
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport – their legs have that covered			2
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as @entity69 ( 66 nights ) and @entity71 ( 44 nights )			1
sometimes , they get a good night ’s sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers			0
showers are ‘ sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ’ admits @entity17			2
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay			2
@entity1 often stars in their images with @entity17 the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb @entity17 gives up his camera for a moment , though , as @entity18 @entity1 captures her @entity44 boyfriend taking a rest on the road while they often pitch their tent in stunning settings , this pedestrian tunnel during their journey through @entity96 is n't one of them @entity103 green hills and a shimmering lake greeted the duo in the @entity53 as their open - ended odyssey continued cheapest countries @entity108 1.65 @entity109 2.02 @entity110 2.18 most expensive @entity111 5.11 @entity112 4.48 @entity54 4.11 per person , per day when asked on their blog , @entity115 , how they can possibly live like this , @entity17 answered simply			1
‘ pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables			0
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ’ he said			0
‘ we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in @entity132 countries where half of the food production end up in the bin			0
’ @entity17 and @entity1 started in @entity36 before heading south - east and working their way through @entity54 , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through @entity44 and @entity141			1
pedal power then took them through the north of @entity109 , @entity41 , @entity112 , @entity34 , @entity108 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity110 and into @entity96			0
@entity1 walks with her bike while @entity17 trails behind to capture a snowy landscape in @entity96 , which they traversed the entire north of @entity17 and @entity1 's tent in a field in @entity34 - this is their usual means of accommodation although they often use hosting websites @entity158 and @entity1 take a break in an @entity109 mountain town as they work their way from @entity54 towards eastern @entity162 @entity17 rides along the waterside in @entity164 , @entity110 , one of more than 200 stops they 've made in their journey so far all landscapes and settings are greeting @entity17 and @entity1 , including moody forests in @entity54 as they rode along both coasts @entity1 rides into the clouds as pedal power takes her and @entity17 through eastern @entity162 and towards @entity174 , their next continent the view from @entity17 and @entity1 's tent as they awake to another day in the saddle as they live out their dream @entity17 shows off the huge amount of gear he and @entity1 need to carry as they work their way around the world ‘ cycling over the bridge at the border between @entity110 and @entity96 was symbolic , ’ @entity17 says			1
‘ riding away from @entity162 , finally crossing into a different continent			0
finally going further away and into the unknown			0
’ they traversed the entire northern coast of @entity96 , before riding through @entity192 and their latest destination , @entity195 , and they plan to ‘ continue into @entity174 , across the @entity197 with the idea to cycle all the length of the @entity202 continent			0
’ ‘ we are going to be on the road for the following years , ’ they say .			0

@entity0 and @entity1 left @entity36 last year on a quest to *explore* the world on bicycles
they camp or stay with @entity69 and @entity213 hosts and spent an average *€* 2.99 per day
@entity17 , from @entity44 , and @entity1 , from @entity18 , moved to @entity15 together after meeting in @entity19 in 2011
