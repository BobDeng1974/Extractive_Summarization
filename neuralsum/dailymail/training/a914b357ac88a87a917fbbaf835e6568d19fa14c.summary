by @entity0 hospital patients should avoid undergoing surgery at the weekend if they want the best chance of surviving , a global study has revealed			1
researchers from @entity7 , @entity8 , using statistics of more than 55million patients , found that patients are 17 per cent more likely to die on a saturday afternoon because of the ' weekend effect '			1

february was the highest risk month for surgery , with surgery in february associated with a 16 per cent increased risk of death compared with surgery in all other months			2
further work on the data will be carried out in the coming months , including looking at the possible reasons behind the variations			0
the authors say : ' several factors may have influenced this outcome			0
' for example , it may be that standard of care differs throughout the day and between weekdays and weekends			0
' although we controlled for risk factors including emergency surgery in our study , it may very well be that the patients treated in the afternoon and on the weekends were more severely ill. ' we need more data to draw conclusions regarding seasonal variation in postoperative outcome			2
' they add : ' despite having an accredited quality management system in place in our hospitals , as well as having the @entity80 of @entity82 's @entity81 of patient safety in @entity82 implemented , this study shows that we should seek to further improve patient safety			0

he told the @entity107 : ' both studies acknowledge the differences could reflect poorer care or simply that patients admitted at these times were more severely ill. ' more research is needed to find out exactly what contributes to higher mortality at weekends			2
is it lack of clinical staff , nursing staff , diagnostic services , other hospital resources ? ' last october , the @entity122 confirmed it was moving to a seven - day operation , despite months of opposition			1
the @entity125 also agreed the quality of care provided in hospitals at the weekend needs to be improved			1
