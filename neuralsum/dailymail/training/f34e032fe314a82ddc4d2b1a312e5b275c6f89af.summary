@entity13 , the conservative mayor of @entity3 , east of the @entity2 capital , has approved the new artwork , which will be inaugurated in may			1
the £ 70,000 statue will not only ‘ celebrate ’ the looks of the multi-millionaire heiress and former supermodel , but portray her as local factory worker			1
by being immortalised in bronze , ms @entity6 will follow in the footsteps of @entity24 legends including @entity25 and general @entity26			0
‘ it ’s an absolute joke , ’ said @entity28 , a 19 - year - old student from @entity3			1
‘ @entity6 represents big money privilege – she has nothing in common with ordinary people at all			0
‘ the only reason the mayor wants this statue put up is to impress the president			2
’ ms @entity6 , who retains her maiden name in her career as a pop singer , became president @entity42 ’s third wife following a whirlwind romance in 2008			0
the 44 - year - old has since built up a reputation as one of @entity2 ’s most pampered and high - spending first ladies , and is often referred to as ‘ @entity48 ’ , after the spoilt @entity2 queen who was eventually guillotined			2
yet mr @entity13 , who belongs to mr @entity42 ’s ruling @entity51 coalition , believes that an image of the @entity54 - born heiress will bring a ‘ little piece of @entity56 ’ to @entity3			2
the commuter town has a large @entity59 community among its 30,000 residents , and mr @entity13 believes that many will be impressed by the six feet plus statue			2
it is currently being created in secret by @entity65 , an artist who is one of ms @entity6 ’s favourite			0
artist @entity65 , who previously worked on a statue of the late @entity69 pope @entity68 , pictured , will depict the @entity2 first lady in working clothes ms @entity6 will be depicted in working clothes as a tribute to the ‘ plumassieres ’ – women who worked local feather factories			1
but @entity77 , a local @entity78 mp , said : ‘ it ’s sad for the women who have worked in this industry			0
referring to ms @entity6 ’s modeling days , mr @entity77 added : ‘ @entity6 must have seen more feathers on ostriches and on catwalks than in factories ! ’ and @entity87 , a @entity3 councillor , said the fact that the statue was being modelled on ms @entity6 was a ‘ a small detail which was specified during the budget vote			1
’ a spokeswoman for ms @entity6 said she ‘ receives numerous artistic requests ’ but did not view herself as ‘ @entity25 or @entity26			0
’ she confirmed that ms @entity6 had met @entity94 , whose last major work was a giant statue of @entity97 @entity68 , and authorised her to use her face in the @entity3 work			1
ms @entity6 is currently at the centre of a charity funding scandal , in which she has been accused of funneling @entity103 funds to close friends from the music industry in @entity11			0
her husband , mr @entity42 , is widely expected to lose presidential elections due this april / may , meaning she will no longer be the first lady .			0
