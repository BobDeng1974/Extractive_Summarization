the duel between @entity1 and @entity2 will make saturday 's @entity4 final extra special			1
it is @entity2 's last game in @entity7 before he retires and he is up against the young guy who has taken over the @entity10 no 10 shirt he wore for so long			1
it 's a battle capable of capturing everyone 's imagination			2
flat out for glory : @entity16 fly - half @entity1 leads the charge for @entity19 success in the zone : @entity16 fly - half @entity1 practices his place - kicking on friday it 's normal to compare and contrast opposition players but these two have many similarities			1
they faced each other in the semi-finals last year and , if anything , @entity1 has become more like @entity2 since then			1
@entity1 comes across as quite shy off the field , uninterested in the limelight and wanting to focus on improving his game , just like @entity2			1
on the field , both are in their element running the show			0
@entity1 has learned to control and channel his aggression - just as @entity2 has always done - and his greater maturity has improved his game			1
defensively , @entity2 set new standards for his position and @entity1 is a hugely committed tackler			1
he has the same toughness his dad @entity40 was known for in rugby league and union			2
@entity43 : @entity1 and mascot @entity45 get ready for the big match with session in cryotherapy chamber fitness boost : @entity16 players tackle the big chill in a cryotherapy chamber @entity1 wants the ball all the time , more so than @entity2 , but still has to learn when not to commit to rucks			1
we spent a lot of time stopping @entity2 from getting drawn into the breakdown and @entity1 tends to be in there more than he should			1
he will learn it is not a slight on his toughness to keep out of that contact area and focus on running the show			0
he needs to be on his feet , ready to act as first or second receiver			0
over the past year @entity1 has made a lot more half - breaks , holding up the ball , using his footwork and putting people into space			1
he is also scoring more tries			0
this stems from playing flatter to the line , which means you do n't have to be super-fast in order to off - load and score			0
@entity2 is rightly earning huge praise as his career is about to end			1
at his peak he was the best in his position in the world and i believe @entity1 can achieve the same status			1
perhaps we may soon see @entity2 coaching him as part of the @entity10 set - up - now , that could become a great partnership			2
final fling : @entity2 's playing his last game in @entity7 one of the reasons @entity2 has been so effective for @entity96 has been the presence of @entity98			1
having a ball - playing inside centre alongside him is key for @entity2 and @entity98 is one of the few players i 've seen who would have pushed hard to make my 2003 @entity10 team			1
he has special qualities , like @entity106 and @entity107 had , which they used to help bring out the best in @entity2			2
he plays so well next to a 12 who keeps talking to him and has the ability to play at 10 , so can step in at first receiver if needed			0
@entity98 fulfils that role at @entity96 and that takes pressure off @entity2			1
with both men in the side , @entity96 have an ideal left - footer , right - footer combination			2
pitch perfect : @entity2 in training ahead of the @entity4 final saracens have @entity125 , a top defensive player , at 12			1
he does n't offer the same attacking support to @entity1			1
defence coaches are happy to have a basher in that position - someone who will make tackles and run hard - but against the best teams you need another ball - player who can pass and kick to the highest standards			0
as a coach , you know that if you have a genuine 10 standing on either side of a ruck , your team will be a much greater attacking threat than if you just have one man trying to orchestrate everything			2
i was in @entity146 to watch @entity96 play @entity147 in the quarter - finals and was very impressed			2
they have so much power married with great skill but they rely a lot on @entity154 for momentum in midfield			0
i would put him in the same bracket as @entity159 ; he could be one of the world 's top players but needs to refine his game			2
he smashes into people time after time , without looking for the off - load , but he does put his side on the front foot ; then @entity2 and @entity98 line up on either side of the ruck , ready to use the space if they get quick ball			1
@entity96 also have plenty of big , ball - carrying forwards , like @entity175			1
they also have a broad skills set			0
the best example is @entity178 , the @entity179 captain in their back row			0
like @entity2 , he has been a huge asset to the club and sets standards on and off the field			1
i know @entity96 coach @entity185 from when i was coaching @entity10 and he was in charge of @entity146			1
he has one of the hardest club jobs in rugby			1
it is a bit like coaching @entity192			0
if you win a trophy , everyone says that is what should happen , because you have so many amazing players			0
if it goes wrong , your career could be in tatters			0
pressure : @entity96 coach @entity185 has one of the hardest club jobs in rugby having so many top players at one club requires great management and @entity185 deserves credit for creating a positive environment			1
there is unity and focus among the players , which is not easy to achieve			0
some observers have criticised @entity96 for using brute force and not creating enough opportunities for runners like @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218			2
but their approach has been very effective			0
a lot of @entity146 clubs play in a pragmatic , power - based way , but the @entity146 have n't lost their creative spark - not when they have brilliant centres such as @entity225 and @entity226			0
i 'd expect them to be in with a real chance by the time the @entity230 arrives			0
danger : @entity16 smashed @entity232 in the @entity4 semi-final i 'm a fan of how @entity16 have developed and of the relentless nature of their game			1
their chairman , @entity236 , sets the tone			0
he has been around since the game went pro and has committed time , energy and money to make the club a force			2
they meet pressure with pressure			0
there is so much focus on winning turnovers and when they achieve that , they go for the jugular			0
they play with tempo , attacking intent and an incredible work ethic			2
all their attributes were displayed in the semi-final last month when they smashed @entity232 , who i expected to beat them at @entity264			0
@entity265 is one of @entity16 ' most potent weapons			0
whether or not he is the best winger in @entity10 is open to debate but if asked if i would like to coach him , the answer would be a definite ' yes '			0
threat : @entity265 is one of @entity16 ' most potent weapons @entity265 is a consistent try - scorer and is very good at tracking the ball but he should work on his tackling and beating defenders on the outside			0
his speed is n't in question and if afforded space he 'll hurt you , but i 'd like to see him master the art of deception better so that he can create space for himself			0
it is a contest between @entity96 's big - match , big - name players , who will want to win it for @entity2 , and @entity16 ' work ethic and team spirit			1
if it was a wet winter night , @entity96 would be more vulnerable			2
under the @entity291 roof , i think they will win , just .			0
