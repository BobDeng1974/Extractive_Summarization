by @entity0 last updated at 11:13 am on 2nd march 2012 @entity1 has drawn up a secret diktat which could force @entity3 to admit 12,000 workers from @entity5 despite soaring unemployment at home			1
the order is part of an @entity11 - wide plan to boost trade with @entity5			1
@entity11 officials say that , in return for opening up the jobs market , countries such as @entity3 will be helped to land lucrative export deals			2
but , of 40,000 workers who will be allowed to live and work in @entity19 , @entity3 has been told it must take 12,000 , according to leaked @entity11 documents			1
soaring unemployment : 12,000 @entity5 workers will be allowed into @entity3 under trade plan - despite the number of people out of work rising this is far more than any other @entity11 nation - and three times the number which will be permitted @entity29			1
even @entity30 , which has one of the world ’s largest economies , will admit only 8,000 workers			0
the @entity5 migrants , who can live and work in @entity3 for six months , will be in addition to people given visas under @entity3 ’s supposedly strict immigration cap			1
this is despite the @entity11 not normally being allowed to meddle in @entity3 ’s border controls			2
it comes at a time when @entity3 unemployment is close to a 17 - year high , at 2.67million			1
the negotiations on the @entity5 deal - which have been led by @entity48 ’s @entity47 - have been going on in the shadows for years			1
trade deal : secret diktat for @entity5 workers to come to @entity3 was drawn up when @entity53 was an @entity11 commissioner a large number of the beneficiaries will be it workers , who already arrive in large numbers from @entity5			1
sir @entity58 , chairman of @entity59 , said : ‘ the ( negotiations ) are quite clearly against the interests of @entity3 workers at a time of very high unemployment			1
‘ that , presumably , is why the government has been keeping quiet about them			0
‘ the six month limit , although completely unenforceable , keeps them out of the official immigration figures			0
however , in practice , this agreement , if signed , would open the door for thousands of new migrants			0
‘ of particular concern is our it workforce - already being undercut by @entity5 it companies - which will be put under further pressure			1
’ the details emerged in a leaked copy of the @entity11 / @entity5 @entity80 , which is due to be signed later this year			2
it was first initiated by former trade commissioner @entity53 in 2007			0
the aim is to encourage greater export trade between the @entity11 and @entity5			2
@entity85 to the agreement is the @entity11 ’s offer on what is known as ‘ @entity88 ’ , which will allow @entity5 companies to bring temporary workers into the @entity11			1
the @entity11 has proposed that , overall , 40,000 @entity5 workers will be admitted without any labour market test as to their impact on the resident workforce			1
the proposal is for each member state to take a proportion of the @entity11 commitment			0
the @entity3 allocation of 12,000 is 30 per cent of the total - despite the @entity3 making up only 12 per cent of the @entity11 ’s population			1
bound for @entity3 : under the controversial deal at least 12,000 @entity5 workers will head to the @entity3 - more than for any other state within the @entity11 critics points out that , although the proposed stay in the @entity3 is limited to six months , there are currently no checks on departure nor obligations on employers to ensure that migrants return home			1
a six month period means no tax or @entity116 will be paid in the @entity3			0
the 12,000 is only a minimum commitment , rather than a ceiling			0
the worker are in addition to the current cap of 20,700 work permits given to @entity124 skilled migrants			0
instead , the visas would be issued under the - so - called ‘ @entity128 ’ category of the immigration system			0
last year only 453 visas were issued under this route			0
ministers are desperately struggling to hit the prime minister ’s target of reducing net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving in the @entity3 , and those leaving - to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
currently , net migration stands close to a record high at 250,000			0
however , only migrants who move to @entity3 for 12 months or more are included in this total			2
this means the @entity5 workers will never register in the figures			1
earlier this week , government advisers said the immigration cap was failing to ‘ bite ’			0
the @entity147 said only 10,000 migrants have entered the under the cap in the past year			0
but , at the same time , almost 30,000 non-eu workers have moved to the @entity3 using so - called ‘ intra-company transfers ’			1
these allow firms to bring in their own workers who they already employ overseas - effectively by - passing the cap policy			0
originally , it was envisaged the transfers - long criticised as a back - door into @entity3 by campaign groups - would be included in the cap			2
but , after a turf war between the @entity162 and @entity164 business secretary @entity163 , they were excluded			0
mr @entity48 protested during a trip to @entity5 - where many intra-company transfers ( @entity167 ) originate - and the prime minister caved - in			2
the @entity169 was initiated by former trade commissioner @entity53 in 2007			0
it is hoped that improved relations between the @entity11 and @entity5 will help countries such as @entity3 to land lucrative export deals			1
last night , a spokesman for the business department said : ' we want to see an ambitious agreement concluded in 2012			0
this has the potential to be a game - changing deal delivering significant benefits for the @entity3 across a wide range of trade interests			2
increasing our trade with emerging economies such as @entity5 will be central to the @entity3 's future long term growth - a good agreement will benefit the @entity3 by £ 2 billion by 2020			1
' negotiations are still underway , and there is no question of us agreeing to anything that undermines the @entity3 @entity194 ’s immigration cap			0
these are highly - skilled short - term service providers , for example engineers , architects or other professionals , who would be admitted temporarily to the @entity3 and other @entity11 countries to provide a specific service on a short - term basis			2
we have been very clear about these parameters in the negotiation			0

@entity3 must take more @entity5 workers than any other nation - and twice as many as @entity29
@entity3 must take 30 **%** of the workers despite having only 12 **%** of the population
