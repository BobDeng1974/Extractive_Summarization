an @entity2 bomber sent to blow up a @entity4 - bound airliner was actually a double agent who infiltrated the group and volunteered for the suicide mission , it has been revealed			1
@entity9 's intelligence agency placed the undercover operator inside @entity11 ( @entity11 ) where he convinced his handlers to give him the new type of non-metallic bomb			0
the agent , who was in @entity17 , was liaising with the @entity18 before handing the device over to intelligence services			1
plotter ? senior @entity2 leader @entity22 , killed on sunday by a drone strike , was believed to be behind the updated underpants bomb plot @entity11 have been identified as the most dangerous and determined branch of the terror network			1
the explosive device was supposed to be smuggled aboard an aircraft undetected and then detonated			1
the revelation , first reported by the @entity31 , shows how the @entity18 was able to get its hands on a sophisticated underwear bomb well before an attack was set in motion			1
the agent arrived safely in an unidentified country and is being debriefed			0
new terror alert : the feds say @entity2 planned to strike on the first anniversary of @entity42 's death experts at the @entity45 's bomb laboratory in @entity46 , @entity47 , are now analysing the device to see if it could have evaded airport security			1
it did not contain metal , meaning it probably could have passed through an airport metal detector			2
but it is not clear whether new body scanners used in many airports would have detected it			0
if such a device could be smuggled through , it could in theory be detonated before passengers or crew knew it was on board			0
it appeared to be an upgraded version of the so - called ' underwear bomb ' that failed to down a passenger jet over @entity69 on christmas day 2009			2
a bombing was to be carried out , reports suggest , to mark the first anniversary of the killing of @entity42			0
' like that bomb , this device bears the forensic signature of feared @entity2 bomb maker @entity79 , ' who is believed to be hiding in @entity17 , the @entity31 website reported			1
the operation relied not on the high - tech and satellite surveillance for which the @entity18 has been known in recent years , but old - fashioned human intelligence work			1
it did , however , produce intelligence that helped the @entity18 locate top @entity2 operative @entity22 , who was killed on sunday when a @entity18 drone targeted him with a missile as he stepped out of his car in @entity17			1
two counter-terrorism officials told the @entity91 they believed 37 - year - old @entity92 , who had a $ 5million bounty on his head , was the key militant behind the plans			2
@entity22 was indicted in the @entity4 for his role in the 2000 bombing of the @entity101 in the harbour of @entity103 , @entity17 , in which 17 @entity4 sailors were killed and 39 injured			1
bomber shorts : @entity105 wore this underwear outfitted with explosives for three weeks before the failed bomb attempt on christmas day 2009 terror strike : @entity105 , pictured in his 2009 mugshot , was sentenced to three life terms after pleading guilty he was later believed to have replaced @entity114 as the @entity2 on the @entity116 's head of external operations when the latter was killed in a @entity4 airstrike last year			1
senator @entity120 , of @entity121 , who heads the @entity122 , said yesterday she had been briefed about an ' undetectable ' device that was ' going to be on a @entity4 - bound airliner			1
' there were no immediate plans to change security procedures at @entity4 airports			1
however , there are claims that extra air marshals have been deployed across @entity132 to protect @entity4 - bound jets			1
flights out of @entity135 , in @entity136 , reportedly received 100 percent coverage			0
the ' would - be suicide bomber ' , based in @entity17 and believed to be working for @entity139 , had not been given a target plane or bought his tickets when the @entity18 seized the bomb			1
@entity144 spokeswoman @entity143 said president @entity145 learned about the plot in april			0
all passengers on @entity4 - bound flights are checked against terrorist watch lists and law enforcement databases			1
in some countries , @entity4 officials are stationed in airports to offer advice on security matters			2
in some cases , though , the @entity4 is limited to hoping that other countries follow the security advice from the @entity159			2
the @entity161 2009 bombing originated in @entity162 , where the bomber did not receive a full - body scan			0
and in 2010 , terrorists smuggled bombs onto cargo jets , which receive less scrutiny than passenger planes			0
in both those instances , the bombs were made by @entity2 's master bomb maker in @entity17 , @entity79			1
officials believe this latest bomb was the handiwork of @entity79 or one of his students			2
armed sky marshals were introduced on @entity179 airliners in 2003 in response to fears of a 9/11 - style terror attack launched from airports in the @entity179			2
then home secretary @entity184 said the move , which was confined to transatlantic routes , was a ‘ proportionate and appropriate response ’ to the terror threat against this country			0
at the time , reports indicated that plain - clothes officers would carry guns firing low - velocity bullets , to prevent one going through the target and piercing the shell of the plane			2
in all likelihood they would be seated near the cockpit , in first or business class			0
passengers are never notified if an air marshal is on their plane , although pilots are told			0
neither the airline industry , police nor @entity207 officials will comment publicly on the policy , and since its introduction it has largely been shrouded in secrecy			0
other countries are more open about their use of sky marshals			0
the @entity216 national airline , @entity217 , has had an armed marshal on every flight for more than a decade			0
and air marshals have been used in the @entity4 for more than 30 years			1
notified : the @entity144 said president @entity145 was told about the terror plot back in april , despite his administration 's claim over the last few weeks that there was no ' credible threat ' to anti-terror investigators , there was little that marked out @entity105 as a potential @entity2 recruit and suicide bomber			2
as the son of one of @entity234 ’s most prominent businessmen , the 25 - year - old former @entity179 university student lived a privileged life with access to large funds , homes in three countries and international travel			0
during his time studying mechanical engineering at @entity243 , he was described as a ‘ quiet , caring , diligent student ’			0
investigators admit he ‘ simply did not fit their profile ’ of a potential terrorist			0
yet on christmas day 2009 , @entity105 came close to blowing up a packed transatlantic flight with explosives sewn into his underwear			0
he flew from @entity253 to @entity162 , then boarded @entity254 to @entity69 , which was carrying 279 passengers and 11 crew			0
hours into the flight , he tried to detonate the explosives by injecting chemicals into them			0
he suffered severe burns when the bomb failed to explode , and was overpowered by passengers and crew			0
disturbingly , the bomb was not picked up in airport security checks in @entity253 and @entity162			1
now serving a life prison sentence in the @entity4 , @entity105 is certain to be questioned again about his bomb , its maker and those who supplied it			2
in @entity270 , he was president of the university ’s @entity271 and ‘ crossed the radar screen ’ of @entity274 , the @entity179 ’s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency , for radical links and communications with @entity271 extremists			0
but investigators say that @entity2 operatives identified @entity105 only as ‘ vulnerable ’ and did not target him until after he began studying @entity282 in the @entity17 capital @entity283 in august 2009			1
suspect : authorities believe the updated underwear bomb was the work of master bomb maker @entity79 @entity2 's most feared bomb maker is believed to be behind the foiled plot to bring down a @entity4 - bound airliner			1
@entity79 was responsible for the so - called underpants bomb which was supposed to blow up on christmas day in 2009			1
experts said the new device handed over to the @entity18 by the double agent who was operating in @entity17 bears the same forensic signature			1
@entity4 authorities believe the weapon was either made by @entity299 or one of his students and they described it as an upgraded version of the bomb used in the 2009 plot			1
@entity299 , 30 , is believed to be hiding in @entity17 where he arrived in 2006 after being jailed by @entity9 officials in crackdowns against @entity271 militants			2
the twist this time was an absence of metal , which could have made the device undetectable by conventional airport scanners			2
' it was a threat from a standpoint of the design , ' said @entity316 , president @entity145 's counterterrorism adviser			0
his younger brother , @entity318 , also made the trek to @entity17 as they turned their backs on their father , a four - decade veteran of the @entity9 military			1
in @entity17 's rugged northern mountains , they met with fugitive @entity17 militant @entity326 , a former aide to @entity42 , and became the nucleus of the new @entity331 affiliate , said the magazine account , which could not be independently confirmed			0
they later brought in @entity4 - born cleric @entity114 as a powerful propaganda voice in the @entity335			1
@entity336 was killed in a @entity4 airstrike last september			0
@entity4 intelligence officials at first believed @entity79 also was killed in the attack , but their suspicions were proven wrong several weeks later			1
after the failed @entity161 2009 bombing , investigators pulled @entity79 's fingerprint off the bomb hidden in the underwear of the @entity234 - born suspect , @entity105 , aboard the @entity348 flight			1
less than a year later , @entity79 was linked to the discovery of printer cartridges packed with @entity351 and sent by international courier with @entity354 - area synagogues listed as the destination			2
the explosive - rigged packages - believed powerful enough to bring down a plane - were pulled off airplanes in @entity136 and the @entity359			0
@entity299 became a major focus of @entity4 's anti-terrorism efforts			0
in march 2011 , @entity362 officially designed @entity79 as a wanted terrorist , calling him the primary bombmaker for @entity11			2
it also presumably puts @entity79 among the chief targets on the @entity4 hit list			1
since the terror attacks on the morning of september 11 , 2001 , @entity2 has put different types of plans into action in numerous @entity373 plots			0
while none of the plots have been successful , they have brought change to airport screenings and other security measures .			0

scores of air marshals were posted to @entity132 last week to protect @entity4 - bound aircraft , according to reports
fears the device would have passed through airport security undetected
double agent now out of @entity17 after handing @entity2 bomb to the @entity18
