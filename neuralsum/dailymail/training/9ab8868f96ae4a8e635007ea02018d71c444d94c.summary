@entity0 left behind plenty of friends at @entity3 when he moved to @entity4 this summer but he ca n’t disguise some irritation that @entity6 never gave him a proper chance at @entity8			1
@entity0 , the major threat to @entity10 in their @entity11 play - off first leg in @entity13 on tuesday , scored 14 goals in 23 starts for @entity3			1
but he was only ever called upon by @entity6 when @entity16 and @entity17 were unavailable			2
unfortunately , it was like that in my case , ’ said the 29 - year - old @entity25 striker			1
‘ but i am happy i moved from @entity23 to @entity3 and achieved what i did			2
i have lots of friends there			0
@entity39 is one of my best friends , i am close to @entity41 , too			0
all my wishes are for them to win the league			0
’ @entity3 begin their title campaign at @entity45 on monday but @entity0 ’s focus will be on the big game 24 hours later when 76,000 fans will cram into @entity13 ’s @entity49 , scene of @entity52 ’s famous win in the @entity54 final			1
ironically , @entity0 came very close to joining @entity56 ’s team a year ago			2
@entity6 scuppered the deal at the 11th hour after running scared of the @entity58 when they signed @entity60			2
‘ i always said the move to @entity10 was close			2
i thought the deal was done and i would just go and do the medical , but it went another way , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ @entity6 has said why it did n’t happen			0
he was honest , he just did n’t want to give them a striker who could score goals , especially with the arrival of @entity60			0
now i am playing @entity10 in such a big match			0
it ’s crazy but i ’ve no regret on everything that happened			0
’ good pals : @entity0 describes former @entity3 team - mate @entity39 as one of his best friends @entity0 is already a cult hero in @entity13 , something special in a city of 20 million people where the passion for football is all - consuming			1
after a low - key debut for his new club in a pre-season friendly at @entity88 of all places , @entity0 ’s hat - trick against @entity84 earned @entity4 their place against @entity10			1
the winner over two legs will earn a place in the @entity11 group stages and a minimum of £ 30m , vital to the @entity97 club who finished third in their league last season and are building a new stadium			1
@entity0 thinks his side have an outside chance of causing a shock			2
‘ our team are very young and still learning , ’ he said			0
‘ we will have a very tough game against @entity10 , but we want to go through to the @entity11 spot and get the six matches in the group stages			1
’ hopeful : @entity0 thinks his new side have an outside chance of beating @entity10 in the @entity11 play - off @entity0 was an unused substitute when @entity3 thrashed @entity10 6 - 0 in march and is happy to pass on any tips to his new team - mates			1
‘ the calibre of @entity3 ’s forward players is a little different , but we have a lot of young players who are very rapid and very comfortable with the ball , ’ he said			0
‘ maybe we can learn from the @entity10 game at @entity3 and cause damage in the same way			1
’ it was a real coup for @entity4 manager , @entity128 and @entity130 defender @entity129 , and @entity97 football in general to persuade @entity0 to leave the @entity132			1
‘ i made the decision because of the love they showed me for many weeks , ’ he said			0
‘ i knew the club and the fans really wanted me and when you get this kind of love , you do n’t hesitate too much			0
