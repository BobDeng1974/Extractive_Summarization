by @entity0 a @entity2 officer who spent a year training and fighting alongside @entity6 tribesmen has been honoured for inspiring a local resistance to the @entity8 – drawing comparisons with @entity10			1
captain @entity11 , 25 , who immersed himself in the culture and lifestyle of villagers in southern @entity6 , has won the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , @entity17 ’s second - highest battlefield honour			1
since the @entity17 - led campaign in @entity20 began seven years ago , hundreds of @entity17 officers have attempted to mentor @entity6 personnel , with varying success			1
captain @entity11 of the @entity2 immersed himself in @entity6 culture , growing a beard , wearing a neck - scarf and learning to speak @entity26 few have gone to the lengths of captain @entity11 , who spent every day and night with a 25 - man unit of @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , cooking and eating with them , learning their language and gaining their trust			1
captain @entity11 has been credited with turning the hope for a functioning @entity30 force into a reality in @entity20 ’s strategically significant district of @entity41 - e @entity40			1
so successful was his influence that his commanders tore up the cultural advisors ’ rulebook and granted @entity11 ‘ artistic licence ’ to live as an @entity6			1
with a wispy beard hanging six inches from his jaw and a traditional black @entity6 scarf wrapped around his neck , by day @entity11 led the local policemen on patrol missions and firefights with rebel insurgents			1
in order to gain their trust completely , he also lived , ate , and slept with them , becoming so fluent in their @entity26 language that he could participate in traditional night - time poetry recitals			1
the @entity15 – second only to the @entity62 as a gallantry award – is intended to recognise his willingness to remain so perilously exposed for so long , and his bravery when confronted by the enemy			2
now his feats have attracted comparisons with @entity69 , the @entity17 officer who inspired the @entity71 revolt against @entity74 @entity73 forces in @entity75 during the @entity76			2
his exploits were celebrated in the epic 1962 adventure film starring @entity79			2
speaking to @entity80 , @entity11 modestly dismissed any comparison and praised his bosses from the @entity17 ’s newly formed @entity83 ( @entity83 ) for giving him such personal freedom			1
he said : ‘ so long as i was providing intelligence i could just get on with it			2
‘ my job was to go into areas where we did n’t have a lot of knowledge , to speak to the villagers and to train the local police officers			2
‘ in these areas allegiances could change in a moment , everyone knew somebody in the @entity8			0
i would lead these @entity6 elements in engagements against the insurgents			1
’ he added : ‘ sharing a bed with the @entity6 was n’t the done thing , nobody else was doing that			1
i suppose i went a bit bush , especially with the really horrible beard			2
' i got accustomed to the title “ @entity109 ” too , which means captain in @entity26			2
@entity11 only joined the @entity2 after a back injury robbed him of his dream to row at the @entity112 but has now been awarded @entity113 , the second highest honour ‘ @entity115 in @entity26 was really important as i would have lost a lot of the wit and banter without that			1
' we were getting attacked by the @entity8 every day			0
then in the evening we ’d prepare food together and recite poetry			2
‘ the @entity123 have a history of great poets			0
we ’d listen to this verse , which is often set to dreadful disco beats , until about midnight then fall asleep together on mattresses or these wicker beds outside , gazing at the stars			0
‘ we ’d tell jokes too			0
they had a good sense of humour , a lot of slapstick			1
if somebody fell over they ’d burst out laughing			0
' they loved cricket and being fairly ignorant about it i had to learn fast			1
‘ family matters were also very important , so i ’d always ask about their parents and children			0
' these were young guys from the villages , eager to do their bit and after a month or two together i did trust them			0
‘ had there been any insurgents among them i ’m sure those @entity30 i was closest to would have protected me			0
’ @entity11 ’s friendships with his @entity6 were tested to the extreme on june 13 last year when the @entity30 joined soldiers from the @entity153 on an operation to capture a @entity8 sniper – a mission which cost the life of lance corporal @entity158 , who was later awarded the @entity62			1
@entity11 recalled : ‘ me and the @entity6 knew there was enemy inside the compound so we pushed in			1
' the guy with me was cut down pretty much straight away , killed after taking a burst of 15 to 20 rounds			0
he was touching distance from me			0
‘ as i moved forward to drag him out a grenade rolled around the corner			0
i jumped over a wall , landing upside down in a ditch			0
the guy who died was in his late 20s and was someone i was very close to			0
so i was really , really sad			0
losing a close colleague is the worst feeling in the world			0
’ on a follow - up assault , @entity176 was killed trying to post a grenade through the window of a @entity8 mud hut			0
@entity11 cleared the remaining enemy from the building and rescued another @entity17 casualty			1
@entity11 , who stands 6ft 4in and weighs 15 stone , joined the @entity2 after a serious back injury shattered his dreams of winning @entity188 rowing glory in @entity189			1
now he is leaving the @entity2 to retrain as a doctor , and is hoping to work with medical charities in @entity75			0
but @entity6 will forever be in his heart			1
‘ i was distraught to leave that country and feel so privileged to have got so close to the people , ’ he said			0
‘ my hope is that we ’ve done enough in terms of security to allow the @entity6 to be educated , because that is how the next generation will build their country			1
' if we ’ve provided that security then we ’ve done a good job			0
’ former @entity17 commander in @entity6 , colonel @entity205 , said : ‘ he has shown the character , the empathy and the courage of @entity69 and achieved results far beyond what could be expected of one individual			2
' men of @entity11 ’s calibre are most rare , even in the @entity2			2

captain @entity11 , 25 , awarded @entity113
*embedded* with local @entity6 forces , growing beard and learning language
was so successful commanders gave him licence to operate how he wished
found @entity6 loved slapstick humour , cricket and reciting poetry
