fossilised remains of four ancient snakes have been dated between 140 and 167 million years old - nearly 70 million years older than the previous record of ancient snake fossils			1
the incredible find could change the way we think about the origins of snakes , and how and when they came to be			0
this new study makes it clear that the sudden appearance of snakes , some 100 million years ago , reflects a gap in the fossil record , not an explosive radiation of early snakes			1
fossils from the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 have revealed four ancient @entity22 back up to 167 million years			1
illustrated here is @entity24 , a snake that lived during the @entity26 or lower cretaceous periods			0
its fossil was found in @entity30 , @entity19 led by scientists at the @entity33 , the findings were published in the journal @entity35			2
the four snakes were found in two locations in the @entity19 , @entity38 in @entity39 and @entity30 , @entity40 in the @entity20 and near the city of @entity42 , in @entity21			1
these are not new findings , though - rather , the discoveries were made by re-analysing fossils that had previously been classed as lizards			0
closer inspection , though , revealed them to be ancient snakes			1
the oldest known snake , @entity51 , is known only from very fragmentary remains and was a small individual , though it is hard to say how old it was at the time it died			0
it was found in @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity19			0
the largest snake , @entity59 , came from coal deposits in @entity21 , near @entity61			0
it was a much bigger individual at nearly 3.3ft ( one metre ) or more in length			0
several of these ancient snakes ( @entity65 , @entity59 and @entity24 ) were living in swampy coastal areas on large island chains in western parts of ancient @entity69 , while the @entity71 species , @entity72 , is found in river deposits from some distance inland in western @entity40			2
according to @entity19 , the smallest and oldest of the small snakes is eophis underwoodi , which lived 167 million years ago and was about ten inches ( 25cm ) long			1
it is thought to have eaten insects , tadpoles and small minnows			0
the next oldest was @entity72 , from 155 million years ago , was found in @entity81 , while another from the same period , @entity59 , was the largest of the fossils found			1
the latter reached up to four feet ( 1.2 metres ) in length and likely ate larger pretty such as small mammals , lizards and even dinosaurs			2
the most recent , @entity24 , came from 144 million years ago and lived among freshwater snails			1
while the ancient snakes share some features with modern snakes , notably sharp , backward - pointing teeth , and their lengths can be estimated , their exact shape and body form is unknown			2
but the finding could help explain when and why snakes lost their limbs , and ultimately evolved into the smooth creatures we see today			2
the four snakes were found in two locations in the @entity19 , @entity38 in @entity39 ( shown ) and @entity30 , @entity40 in the @entity20 and near the city of @entity42 , in @entity21 on the left is an illustration of the dinosaur - eating @entity72 , which also lived in the @entity26 period , found in the @entity111 in @entity40			1
on the right is @entity59 , the fossil of which was found in the coal swamp deposits at @entity61 , near the city of @entity42 in @entity21 these images show some of the fossils that were analysed			0
top left is the dentary ( lower jaw ) of @entity59 , and bottom left is its maxilla ( upper jaw )			0
top right is the dentary of a python for comparison , while bottom right is the maxilla of @entity24 this animation shows the dentary ( lower jaw ) bone of one of the discovered snake fossils , the @entity59 , which has been noted for its similarity to modern snakes with backwards - pointing teeth ' the problem of how limblessness evolves is pretty much unknown , though modern developmental studies have identified some of the gene cascades that seem to shut down and stop limbs from forming , ' lead author and professor dr @entity144 , from the @entity146 at the @entity33 , told @entity147			2
' @entity148 is extremely common among living groups of lizards , so common in fact that one genus in @entity153 , @entity154 , has about 110 species in it , all of which show every possible version of limb loss from fully limbed with five toes , a tiny limb with one toe on the front and a tiny rear limb with two toes , to completely limbless			0
' why ? it 's not understood at all			0
i wish i could answer the question better , though the one thing i can add is that 100 million - year - old snakes still had back legs			1
' despite the finding , there also remains a large knowledge gap between 140 and 100 million years ago , a period from which no known fossils exist			1
' the study explores the idea that evolution within the group called ' snakes ' is much more complex than previously thought , ' dr @entity144 said			0
' importantly , there is now a significant knowledge gap to be bridged by future research as no fossils snakes are known from between 140 to 100 million years ago			1
' the findings could help explain when and why snakes lost their limbs , and ultimately evolved into the smooth creatures we see today			2
pictured is a python sebae , or @entity197 rock python , in @entity198 from 167 to 100 million years ago , snakes evolved towards the elongated and limbless bodies that characterise them today			1
the researchers add that the distribution of these newer oldest snakes , and the anatomy of the skull and skeletal elements , makes it clear that even older snake fossils are waiting to be found			1
' based on the new evidence and through comparison to living legless lizards that are not snakes , the paper explores the novel idea that the evolution of the characteristic snake skull and its parts appeared long before snakes lost their legs , ' explained dr @entity144 , he added that the identification of definitive snake skull features reveals that the fossils , previously associated with other non-snake lizard remains , represents a much earlier time frame for the first appearance of snakes			0
the concept of how snakes originated and evolved needs to be reassessed in light of this new information , according to the researchers .			0

fossils from the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 have revealed four ancient snakes
dating back up to 167 million years , they are more than 70 million years older than the previous oldest snakes discovered
one of the snakes would have measured *4ft* in length and ate dinosaurs
findings could help explain the appearance of snakes 100 million years ago
and they could reveal how snakes evolved into modern limbless creatures
