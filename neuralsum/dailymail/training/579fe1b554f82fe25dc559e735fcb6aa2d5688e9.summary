staff at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , have been accused of manipulating rides to make them more difficult , after an undercover investigation the allegations , made after a @entity26 investigation , have been ' utterly refuted ' by the company behind the rides			1
it is claimed that wax was used to make it harder for players to knock over blocks , and stall holders were said to have given customers a different type of ball to the one they were originally shown			0
the staff are employed by @entity40 the company manages the stalls at @entity9 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
an @entity40 senior manager was caught on camera admitting that employees were ' increasing the difficulty level ' for some customers			0
the investigation was carried out by new @entity26 consumer show @entity53			1
a spokeswoman for @entity9 said : ' we would never condone any activity on the park which was proven to mislead or in any way disadvantage our guests			0
' she added : ' given these games are operated by third party suppliers - as the programme makes clear - as soon as we were made aware of the allegations ... we contacted them and began our own extensive investigation			1
' this investigation is ongoing but if we find any evidence of malpractice we will take swift and appropriate action against both any individuals concerned and the supplier company			2
' a spokesman at the popular park said it was investigating the allegations , whereas @entity78 , the company which manages the stalls refuted the claims @entity81 , managing director of @entity40 , denied that its games were unfair and criticised the investigation for presenting ' rare and now remedied incidences ' as regular practice			1
he said : ' we utterly refute any suggestions that any of our games are not fair and we had provided detailed information , explanations and evidence to the programme , in advance , to prove this			2
' but the @entity26 decided to ignore much of this information and has therefore presented a biased and incorrect view of the games			2
' it is totally untrue to say that games are manipulated to make people lose			0
the programme itself states that there are times when we make the games easier but presents this as a bad thing , which we - and we believe , our customers - can only see as a benefit			2
' mr @entity81 said that @entity40 had given out more than 100,000 prizes at @entity9 , which ' in retail value is 50 - 60 per cent of the money spent by the customers who play the games			1
' he insisted that the company had provided ' detailed responses ' to all the claims made by the @entity26			0
' we found that in almost all instances the programme had fundamentally misunderstood how the games worked and so we were able to explain and answer their queries in great detail , ' he said			0
' the rare instances where staff behaviour or games fell below standard were immediately checked and remedied			0
