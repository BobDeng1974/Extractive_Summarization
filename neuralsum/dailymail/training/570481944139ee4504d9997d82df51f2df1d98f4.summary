a couple have found a metre - wide safe they believe is more than a century old in their back garden , but there 's just one problem			1
they 've no idea how to get into it			2
@entity8 and @entity9 found the heavy , rusting box - made by the same firm which supplied the @entity11 - sticking out of the earth after they drained their garden pond in @entity14			1
mr @entity15 , 34 , spent an afternoon tirelessly shifting heaps of soil and was astounded to find the safe completely intact			2
under lock and key : @entity8 and @entity9 - and their three - year - old daughter @entity20 - found this rusting fire - proof safe at the bottom of their garden in @entity14 , but without a key its contents are a mystery mystery : the safe bears the logo of @entity34 , a firm whose founder used bonfires to show his safes ' strength a locksmith is now due to visit the couple tomorrow morning - but for the moment , they are enjoying the mystery			1
' we ’ve got a little girl @entity45 , who is three , so we drained the pond , ' said mrs @entity9 , 32 , who works for @entity47 in @entity48			1
plaything : @entity45 , three , with her new garden toy ' we ’d seen this bit of bronze metal poking out from where the old pond used to be for a while but just thought it was part of an old pump			2
' we were completely amazed when it turned out to be the top of a safe			2
my house was built in the 1920s , but this looks a lot older than that			0
' she added : ' it ’s so heavy to lift , we can barely do it between us , so we ’ve had to roll it across the garden and we can hear there ’s something inside			2
. it could just be soil after all these years , but it might be something interesting , you never know ! ' ' before my house was built , there were flats here			0
i do n’t know if it ’s been brought up here to be buried especially when they were building the houses			0
we ’ve just got no idea			0
' the safe was made by @entity34 , which began working in 1814 under @entity83 and became famous for developing the world ’s first fire - proof safes			1
the businessman used to wow crowds with stunts involving elaborate street bonfires to demonstrate that his safes could protect anything that was inside , and five of them were used on the @entity11			1
on the front of the safe found in the @entity95 ’ garden is a plaque which reads ‘ milners of @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 ’ and ‘ patent fire resisting special safe ’			1
it is likely to date from between the mid- 19th century and 1955 , when the @entity104 company merged with the firm @entity105			0
a locksmith will be coming to the couple 's home tomorrow morning to prise open the safe , and it could be a difficult job			1
mystery solved : the couple are due to be visited by a locksmith tomorrow who will try and prise the box open grand : the firm supplied five of the high - security safes that were used on the doomed liner titanic in 1912 ' it 's not in the best condition , ' said mrs @entity9			1
' i do n't know how they 're going to get into it			0
it could take a long time			0
' other safes in a good condition sell for hundreds of pounds on @entity127			0
but mrs @entity9 and her husband , a manager at the @entity130 modern art gallery in @entity14 , said they would be happy to give it to a local museum for free			1
' i 've no desire to keep it , ' she said			0
' it 's big and it 's ugly and i do n't know what i would do with it			0

huge safe was found by @entity8 and @entity9 at their home in @entity14
it was made by 1800s firm @entity145 , which supplied five safes to the @entity11
but they have no idea how to get inside the rusting metal box
a locksmith will be arriving tomorrow and couple hope all will be *revealed*
