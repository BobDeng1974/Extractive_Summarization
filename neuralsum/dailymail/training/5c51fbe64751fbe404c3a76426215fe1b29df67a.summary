by @entity0 published : 15:59 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 06:25 est , 28 september 2013 on @entity3 , competitors in the ballroom enjoy a friendly rivalry			2
in the real world of amateur competition , though , it seems that matters are a bit more cut - throat			2
for @entity12 ’s leading amateur ballroom dancer @entity11 has had his ambitions of glory tripped up – amid rumours of skullduggery			1
mr @entity11 was tipped to waltz away with the top prize at next week ’s prestigious @entity18 in @entity19			1
but his dreams are in tatters after the @entity22 refused to grant a visa allowing his @entity25 partner , @entity24 , to travel to the @entity27 to compete with him			1
‘ it ’s completely untrue , and we are terribly , terribly disappointed , ’ said mr @entity11 , 22 , last night			1
‘ the decision seems to be based on lies			2
we think there have been dirty tricks involved , and have suspicions as to who is responsible			0
but there seems to be nothing we can do			0
’ mr @entity11 and @entity49 , 20 , have been representing @entity12 in international competition since 2011 , under rules that allow couples with different nationalities to choose which to compete for			1
they have won several titles and are regarded by the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , the sport ’s governing body , as the country ’s most talented prospects for a generation			0
this weekend , they were due to compete in two warm - up events in @entity65 before appearing at the @entity66 at the @entity67 on thursday			2
champions : the couple , pictured far right , with their trophy at @entity72 last year miss @entity74 ’s failure to secure a visa has forced them to withdraw			2
it also threatens to stop them competing at the biggest event in the ballroom calendar , november ’s @entity78 in @entity72 , where they were hoping to defend the title they won last year			0
‘ thanks to this @entity22 decision , @entity12 ’s best chance of a winner at the @entity67 has disappeared , ’ said @entity84 , president of the @entity57			1
‘ i find the decision incomprehensible			0
there are so many skivers who come to this country and are just waved through			0
‘ and here we have a legitimate visa application , from a @entity27 champion who has represented this country many times , a lovely person from a good family , who wants to do things by the book , and she has been refused			0
it makes me so disappointed in our government			0
’ mr @entity84 and the @entity57 provided letters vouching for miss @entity24			1
they have been unable to establish why the visa was refused			0
not happy : @entity11 with the letters he has received back from the @entity22 ‘ it ’s alleged that someone has complained about her			1
but we ca n’t find out a thing from the @entity22			0
they wo n’t discuss the case , ’ he said			0
speaking from @entity114 , where she is a part - time student at the @entity25 @entity115 of @entity116 , miss @entity24 said that her application for a sports visitor visa was supported by 30 pages of documents confirming her status as an elite athlete			1
‘ i have been coming to @entity12 regularly for two years , always playing by the rules , so am shocked by what has happened , ’ she said			1
‘ for such an instant change in the @entity22 ’s opinion towards me , there has to have been false information given to them			0
@entity11 and i have been improving dramatically , so perhaps it has left our rivals with no option but to try to take us out of competition			1
’ the @entity22 declined to comment			0
but in the rejection letter to miss @entity24 it said it was ‘ not satisfied ’ she would leave the @entity27 after her visit			1
miss @entity24 described that as ‘ nonsense ’			2
she said : ‘ all i want is to represent @entity12 with @entity11 , which i am very proud to do			1
if i am not allowed back into the country , it could be the end of my career			0

@entity11 and @entity24 are @entity18 champions
the pair have been representing @entity12 since 2011
allegations that a ' tip - off revealed @entity24 had been working illegally '
@entity11 states that it is ' completely untrue '
