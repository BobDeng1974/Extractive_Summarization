@entity1 keeper @entity0 sprang to the defence of manager @entity3 despite the @entity4 coming in for the heaviest criticism he has received yet from @entity1 fans			1
chants of ‘ we want @entity3 out ’ , ‘ you do n’t know what you ’re doing ’ and ‘ we want our @entity1 back ’ emerged during this desperate display at @entity12			1

‘ the manager has been brilliant in defending us but we are the ones who have to score goals			2
he ca n’t go and score for us and the coaching staff ca n’t score for us			2

’ there was controversy late on as @entity81 and @entity82 were both red carded , the former for challenging @entity85 and the latter for his part in a melee , and the pair had to be separated leaving the pitch			0
