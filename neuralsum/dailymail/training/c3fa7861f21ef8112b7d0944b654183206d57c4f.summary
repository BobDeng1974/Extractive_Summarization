the submissions for middle names are just as eclectic , with @entity35 , @entity36 - a , @entity37 all still in with a shout of topping the poll			2
however , to convince his wife to allow him to handover such an important decision to a world of strangers , mr @entity11 said he will have ultimate veto over what is chosen			1
