' the report from this investigation made recommendations which have now been fully implemented , including additional training for staff			0
' in addition , we have also ensured that the computer system used to diagnose patients has been modified to minimise the risk of any future misdiagnoses			0
' we have met with the family of mrs @entity9 to ensure that they are satisfied with the actions taken and to address any remaining questions they had			2
mrs @entity9 visited the @entity114 in 2009 after developing leg pain ' we will now be reviewing all correspondence from the coroner and proactively seeking to work with both him and the @entity119 to resolve any outstanding concerns			2
' we again extend our sympathies to the family of @entity95 and wish to reassure patients that we are committed to ensuring that they are safe and protected whilst in our care			0
