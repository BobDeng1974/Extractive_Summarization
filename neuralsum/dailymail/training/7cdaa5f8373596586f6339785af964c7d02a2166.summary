by @entity0 following powerful volcanic eruptions , large amounts of sulfur dioxide deposit themselves in ice cores buried deep within the @entity5			1
by studying these deposits , researchers from @entity7 have been able to accurately plot the most explosive of these events during the past 2,000 years			2
topping the list was the eruption at @entity12 , @entity13 in 1257 , followed by the @entity15 event of 1452 , and @entity16 in 1815			1
although the study plots earlier events , the researchers do n't know exactly what these explosions were			1
researchers studied records of global ice core sulfate data collected from @entity24			1
in total , the study looked at 26 ice core records collected in an array of 19 sites from across @entity24			1
@entity30 was the most explosive eruption , and it took place in 1257 in @entity13 's @entity34 's ( pictured ) the scientists , led by @entity36 and @entity37 of @entity7 's @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , studied 26 ice core records from 19 sites across @entity24			1
it is the most accurate and precise reconstruction to date of historic volcanic sulfate emissions in the @entity44 , and is the first annually resolved record extending through the @entity46 - the last 2,000 years of human history			2
powerful volcanic eruptions are one of the most significant causes of climate variability in the past due to the large amounts of sulfur dioxide they emit			1
this leads to the formation of microscopic particles known as volcanic sulfate aerosols			1
these aerosols reflect more of the sun 's radiation back to space and ultimately cool the @entity64 's temperature			0
this map plots the most explosive volcanic eruptions of the last 2,000 years , based on the research and using date estimates topping the list was the eruption at @entity12 , @entity13 in 1257 , followed by the @entity15 event of 1452 , and @entity16 , also in @entity13 , in 1815			1
although the study plots earlier events , the researchers do n't know exactly what these explosions were			1
based on the timeline , however , it 's possible to estimate what these events may have been			0
for example , the fourth most powerful eruption took place in around 674 ad , which could have been the @entity85 event in @entity86 or the eastern @entity88 eruption in @entity89 believed to have take place around 700 ad			2
during the research , the scientists discovered evidence of 116 events - and the top ten are pictured in red			0
topping the list was @entity30 , @entity13 in 1257 , followed by @entity15 in 1458 , and @entity16 in 1815			2
the researchers are unsure exactly what the earlier explosions were but have been able to plot the years for the fourth , fifth and sixth fifth and sixth place occurred between 531 to 566 ad and could be the @entity103 explosions in @entity104 that is thought to have took place around 535 onwards			0
the seventh most powerful explosion happened shortly after @entity30 , and may have been @entity107 in the @entity108 in 1280			0
based on the 450 ad date of the eighth place event suggests it was @entity112 in @entity113 , ninth appears to have been the @entity115 and @entity116 eruptions in @entity117 around 1785			0
while tenth place happened shortly before @entity30 and could have been an earlier eruption of @entity34 , @entity13			0
past volcanic events are measured using sulfate deposition records found in ice cores , and have been linked to short - term global and regional cooling			1
the latest research brought together an array of ice core sulfate data in the world , including the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) divide ice core - said to be the most detailed record of volcanic sulfate in the @entity44			2
by studying the levels of sulphate deposits , the team were able to construct a timeline that shows when the largest eruptions took place , based on the level of sulphate found , and which were the most destructive			2

locations of @entity5 ice core sites used for volcanic sulfate aerosol deposition reconstruction are pictured right topping the list was the eruption at @entity12 , @entity13 in 1257 , followed by the @entity15 event of 1452 , and @entity16 in 1815			1
most notably , the research found that the two largest volcanic eruptions in recent @entity64 history deposited 30 to 35 percent less sulfate in @entity24 , suggesting that these events had a weaker cooling effect on global climate than previously thought			1
powerful volcanic eruptions are one of the most significant causes of climate variability in the past due to the large amounts of sulfur dioxide they emit			1

past volcanic events are measured using sulfate deposition records found in ice cores , and have been linked to short - term global and regional cooling			1
these reconstructions are critical to accurate model simulations used to assess past natural and anthropogenic climate changes			0
such model simulations underpin environmental policy decisions including those aimed at regulating greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions to curb projected global warming			0
although the study plots earlier events , it is unclear what these explosions were			1
based on the timeline , however , it 's possible to hypothesise what these events may have been			0
for example , the fourth most powerful eruption took place in around 674 ad , which could be the @entity85 event in @entity86 in 710 , or the eastern @entity88 eruption in @entity89 of 700			0
fifth and sixth place occurred between 500 to 600 ad and could be the @entity103 explosions that took place in 535 and 536			0
the seventh most powerful explosion happened shortly after @entity30 , and may have been @entity107 in the @entity108 in 1280			0
based on the 450 ad date of the eighth place event suggests it was @entity112 in @entity113 , and tenth place happened shortly before @entity30 and could have been an earlier eruption of @entity34			0
‘ this record provides the basis for a dramatic improvement in existing reconstructions of volcanic emissions during recent centuries and millennia , ’ said the report 's lead author @entity36 , a postdoctoral fellow and specialist in @entity39 's unique ultra-trace ice core analytical laboratory , located on the @entity38 's campus in @entity215 , @entity7			2

‘ this work is the culmination of more than a decade of collaborative ice core collection and analysis in our lab here at @entity39 , ’ said @entity37 , a @entity39 research professor who developed the continuous - flow analysis system used to analyze the ice cores			2
an ice core section ( picutred ) is simultaneously analysed for a variety of elements and chemical species in @entity39 's ultra-trace ice core laboratory while slowly melting the ice on a heated melter plate @entity247 , a member of several research teams that collected the cores , including the 2007 to 2009 @entity250 of @entity24 and the @entity252 project that reached a depth of 3,405 meters in 2011 , added , ‘ the new record identifies 116 individual volcanic events during the last 2000 years			2
’ ‘ our new record completes the period from years 1 to 500 ad , for which there were no reconstructions previously , and significantly improves the record for years 500 to 1500 ad , ’ @entity36 added			0
this new record also builds on @entity39 's previous work as part of the international @entity265 ( @entity267 ) effort to help reconstruct an accurate 2,000 - year - long global temperature for individual continents			0
simulations of volcanic sulfate transport performed with a coupled aerosol - climate model were compared to the ice core observations and used to investigate spatial patterns of sulfate deposition to @entity24			1
the third most explosive event took place at @entity278 in @entity13 ( pictured ) in 1815 simulations of volcanic sulfate transport performed with a coupled aerosol - climate model were compared to the ice core observations and used to investigate spatial patterns of sulfate deposition to @entity24			1
‘ both observations and model results show that not all eruptions lead to the same spatial pattern of sulfate deposition , ’ said @entity283 from the @entity285 institute @entity284			0
he added , ‘ spatial variability in sulfate deposition means that the accuracy of volcanic sulfate reconstructions depends strongly on having a sufficient number of ice core records from as many different regions of @entity24 as possible			1
’ the findings are published in @entity300 journal .			0

powerful volcanic eruptions are a significant cause of climate variability
they emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide that *create* microscopic particles known as volcanic sulfate aerosols
past eruptions are measured using sulfate deposits found in ice cores
@entity316 studied 26 ice core records from 19 sites in @entity24
the @entity321 eruption in 1257 produced the *highest* levels of deposits
this was followed by the @entity15 event of 1452 , and @entity16 in 1815
although the study plots earlier events , it is unclear what these were
