foreign television fans are enjoying @entity2 programmes for almost a third of the price charged to @entity6 licence fee payers			1
millions of people across @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 are watching the best of the @entity2 for as little as £ 52 a year , or £ 4.33 a month			2
an annual pass for thousands of hours of drama , comedy and documentaries is available for just £ 52 , compared to the £ 145.50 licence fee paid by @entity6 at home			1
for as little as £ 4 a month people overseas can access @entity19 online while @entity6 residents are forced to pay £ 145 for a licence fee whether they watch the channel or not and overseas users get access to a vast vault of priceless @entity2 archive material unavailable to @entity6 viewers			1
the disparity last night led to calls for the broadcaster to use the money to reduce the licence fee			2
@entity33 mp @entity32 , a member of the @entity34 , said the profits should be used to save domestic viewers money			0
he added : ‘ i am very much in favour of the @entity2 commercialising content and using the revenue to create more innovative , good quality @entity6 - made productions			1
but it is an outrage that they are selling content to foreign nationals at a cheaper rate than to those in the @entity6 who are obliged to pay the licence fee			1
‘ the licence fee is a poll tax			2
people in @entity6 , if they have a tv , have no choice , whether they watch the @entity2 or not			2
’ the @entity2 is quietly expanding the availability of the internet - based global iplayer – which is not available in the @entity6 – after launching a ‘ pilot ’ more than two years ago			1
it can be accessed across @entity8 , as well as in @entity9 and @entity10			0
@entity58 subscribers pay € 7.99 a month ( £ 6.70 ) or € 74.99 euros a year ( £ 63 ) , which works out at £ 5.25 a month			0
in @entity9 the annual cost is even cheaper at 89.99 @entity9 dollars ( £ 52.50 ) while in @entity10 access costs just 84.99 ( £ 52 ) @entity10 dollars – £ 4.33 a month			0
the @entity2 is quietly expanding the availability of the internet - based @entity64 which is not available in the @entity6 ¿ after launching a ¿ pilot ¿ more than two years ago			1
for this , viewers can access 2,000 hours of shows on demand via their @entity71 or @entity72			0
the @entity73 also offers the back catalogues of landmark comedies such as @entity76 and @entity77			0
one @entity10 viewer wrote : ‘ at last decent programming ! @entity10 dollars 85 for a year is nothing for what you get to see or listen to			0
’ foreign viewers are not offered live streamed content , radio or an identical catch - up service to that which is available in @entity6			2
but the vast majority of @entity2 radio programmes can be accessed through the internet anywhere in the world			0
last year , @entity91 , which is behind the move , revealed the @entity19 has already been downloaded over a million times overseas			0
the @entity73 is only available through the @entity95 ‘ app store ’ which means , as with all other services , 30 per cent of all revenue is handed to @entity99 tech giant @entity98			0
just last month the @entity2 revealed a record number of domestic households are watching programmes online , fuelling fears they are legally dodging the licence fee			1
it is thought many viewers who use the iplayer service do not own televisions , meaning they are not required to pay the licence fee			2
a tv licence is required for viewing programmes online only when broadcast in their scheduled slots or streamed live , as in the case of events such as @entity113			0
a @entity2 spokesman said ; ‘ unlike the @entity6 @entity19 , the @entity73 is not a seven - day catch - up service , and it does not offer the same breadth or amount of content available to the @entity6 licence fee payer			1
profits generated by @entity91 are returned to the @entity2 for the ultimate benefit of the licence fee payer			1

millions abroad have cheap access to shows which cost @entity6 viewers £ 145.50
