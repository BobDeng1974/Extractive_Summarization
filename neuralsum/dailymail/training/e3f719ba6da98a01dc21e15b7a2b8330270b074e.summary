at @entity4 last saturday , when @entity0 were playing @entity1 , an act of supreme sportsmanship passed almost unnoticed			1
not quite in the same league as @entity7 when he caught the ball inside the @entity10 penalty area at @entity11 after @entity12 dislocated his knee in december 2000			2
or @entity14 giving @entity15 a fair play award after he pleaded with referee @entity17 not to award a penalty to @entity19 when he went down under a challenge from @entity22 keeper @entity21 in 1997			0
@entity23 ( right ) shaking hands with @entity1 manager @entity25 on saturday @entity23 celebrates @entity0 's victory after a match during which he showed his more generous side a smiling @entity23 speaks during the pre-match press conference before @entity0 faced @entity30 still , @entity23 ’s generosity should be highlighted , particularly after a weekend of football that finished with @entity34 manager @entity33 accusing @entity36 winger @entity35 of cheating			1
@entity23 ’s rampant @entity0 team were 2 - 0 up passing the ball for fun as @entity1 willed it to go out of play for them to make a substitution			1
at the time , with @entity0 in complete control after goals from @entity46 and @entity47 , it felt like palace manager @entity25 would be made to wait for ever			1
both teams were already down to 10			0
@entity0 defender @entity49 was sent off for a studs - up challenge on @entity51 and @entity1 defender @entity52 was sent off for a second booking before half - time			1
with 21 minutes left , @entity25 ’s team were temporarily reduced to nine when @entity56 was forced off the field with an ankle injury			0
it was then that @entity23 approached @entity25 in the technical area			2
@entity23 passed a message to @entity47 , the closest @entity0 player to the technical area and his team suddenly eased off			1
@entity1 were finally able to get the ball out of play			1
@entity25 made the substitution , bringing on @entity67 to replace @entity56 to even the teams up , numerically at least			0
to @entity23 ’s credit he then instructed @entity46 , who received the ball from @entity0 ’s throw - in , to kick the ball back to @entity1 keeper @entity74			1
it was a magnificent sporting gesture			1
there are times when it is easy to bury @entity23 for his touchline posturing , but he has been on his best behaviour of late			1
against @entity22 on october 5 , he had very little involvement in the incident which led to @entity84 shoving him in the chest during their 2 - 0 defeat			2
there was the usual mischief in the air last friday when he reacted to news that @entity84 had got off scott - free after the incident at @entity93			1
‘ me ? me ? me ? ’ he joked			0
he has taken to answering tricky situations by lacing them with sarcasm to avoid appearances on the back pages for all the wrong reasons			0
@entity23 is usually far more gracious when his team are winning and he is has certainly been in a better mood of late			2
@entity84 and @entity23 during their infamous touchline spat in @entity0 's win over @entity22 ahead of the game at @entity1 , which they eventually won 2 - 1 , @entity0 ’s manager claimed he is ‘ a humble guy who tries to learn every day ’			1
he was referring to @entity113 ’s criticism of @entity23 after he attempted to shake hands with @entity115 when his team were beating @entity116 3 - 0 on september 27			2
he is no angel on the touchline , we know that			0
last season he provoked @entity122 manager @entity121 when he jumped into the stands to celebrate with his son @entity124 after @entity126 ’ last - minute winner			0
he has since apologised for jabbing former @entity128 coach @entity127 , sadly no longer with us , in the eye during a highly - charged @entity130 tie with @entity131 in 2011			0
he has cleaned up his act on the touchline , something he has spoken about since his return to @entity137 football with @entity0			2
@entity7 holds the ball after catching it so @entity12 ( centre , on floor ) can receive treatment in 2000 @entity15 ( right ) and @entity21 look perplexed after the award of a penalty in 1997 last march he said : ‘ in this country , it ’s easier to behave because almost everybody behaves and the fourth officials are there to help , not create more problems			0
‘ normally they ’re there to speak and have a dialogue , telling you to calm down , that you do n’t need to do that , must n’t make it difficult for the referee			0
i know i have that responsibility to show maturity			0
‘ i know i have normally a better emotional control than one year ago , two years ago , five years ago			0
’ he was on the edge of the technical area for all the right reasons on saturday when he he spoke with @entity25 about making the change to make it ten versus ten again			0
would he have made the same gesture if @entity0 were n’t in complete control , ‘ from minute one to minute 94 ’ , as @entity23 remarked after the game ? actually , let ’s not go there .			1

@entity23 made @entity0 put ball out when @entity1 were a man down at @entity4 on saturday
it was a magnificent sporting gesture from the @entity0 manager
@entity23 has been on his best behaviour on the touchline of late
@entity84 was the *aggressor* during *battle* of @entity93
