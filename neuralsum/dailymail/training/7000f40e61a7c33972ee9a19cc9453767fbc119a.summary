by @entity0 for the @entity1 when @entity4 the labrador was diagnosed with a mysterious illness that has been killing dogs around the country , she was given just hours to live			1
her devastated owners were handed one last hope , however : an eight - hour operation that vets warned might kill her			1
but they agreed , desperate to save their beloved pet			2
vets at the queen mother @entity34 in @entity36 cured @entity4 by pumping her blood through a dialysis machine which filtered out the pathogens that were attacking her body			1
the procedure , known as plasmapheresis , has been carried out on humans since the 1950s , but had never before been tried on a dog with @entity16			1
the procedure was risky because the machine also removes the clotting agents in the blood that would allow the wound to heal , meaning @entity4 risked bleeding to death			1
yesterday , @entity4 ’s delighted owner @entity49 , 49 , thanked the vets for saving her beloved pet			1
‘ it was a terrifying experience , ’ said mrs @entity49 , who lives in @entity52			2
‘ it was n’t an easy decision			0
but they made it clear it was her only chance of survival , so that made my mind up for me			0
’ mrs @entity49 said the procedure cost £ 6,800 in total , only £ 4,000 of which was covered by her insurance			2
‘ we were lucky we could afford it , ’ she added			0
‘ even then , it meant we ca n’t take a holiday this year			0
if it had gone on much longer we would have had to stop treating her eventually			0
but it is hard to put a price on your pet			0
’ @entity4 ’s case was featured on the @entity80 series @entity81 , which started last night			2
she first fell ill in april , when she developed lesions all over her legs			0
within a day her kidneys started to fail , and she was soon transferred to the @entity85 for expert care			0
there vets diagnosed her with @entity16 , so called because it was first reported in 2012 in the forest in @entity90			1
after eight hours hooked up to the machine @entity4 made a full recovery and is believed to be the first dog in the @entity94 to survive @entity16 vets are still unsure what causes @entity16			1
symptoms include lesions on the skin which wo n't heal , depression , loss of appetite and vomiting followed by kidney failure before surgeons treated @entity4 using the technique , no dog had been known to survive the illness since then the mystery disease has spread to @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , killing more than 40 dogs			1
@entity114 , the vet who treated @entity4 , said he has already seen six cases at the @entity85 but had not managed to save any of them			2
‘ these are very early stages of understanding what the disease process is , ’ he added			0
‘ @entity4 was very lucky because her kidney was not yet completely destroyed , and she was young and healthy enough to recover			1
’ @entity81 continues tonight on @entity80 at 7pm .			0
