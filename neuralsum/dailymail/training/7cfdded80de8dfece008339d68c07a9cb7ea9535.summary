mr @entity7 has a one - quarter share in @entity41 which has current assets of more than £ 2.1 million according to the most recent company accounts			1
the company owes almost £ 142,000 although it reported a profit in 2013 of more than £ 600,000			0
mr @entity7 began the building works under the premise of creating an ' iceberg - home ' - style basement extension			1
@entity21 granted him permission to build an extension to his basement with the installation of a lift , and a garage conversion			2
but he ignored repeated pleas from the local council to stop the unauthorised work , and was eventually fined almost £ 60,000 for the illegal work			1
@entity21 confimed that mr @entity7 will have to restore the exterior of his house to its original state a @entity21 spokeswoman confirmed that mr @entity7 would be ordered to demolish the conservatories			1
she said : ' @entity21 has confirmed they are taking steps against mr @entity7 to remove the harmful works , which includes the two conservatory bays			1
' mr @entity7 ignored the advice of planning officials who told him to stop building the twin extensions mr @entity7 bought the six - bedroom mock @entity73 home , which was built in 1912 , for £ 3.7 million in 2008 , in the historic @entity75 , in @entity75 , north west @entity76			1

@entity21 's leader , councillor @entity84 , said : ' mr @entity7 showed a blatant disregard for the fact he was living in a conservation area in a @entity6 listed building when he decided to alter his house in the way he chose fit			1
' planning laws are there for a reason and the high level of fine reflects the seriousness of this breach			0
' building to the home designed by architect @entity99 in the exclusive garden suburb requires approval from the @entity102 , even for building a garden shed			0
the trust made numerous complaints to the council that @entity7 was carrying out unapproved work to the property , which has three bathrooms and three receptions and was listed for conservation in 1996			2
@entity7 and his architect assured conservation officers that he would cease unauthorised work when they visited the luxury property but he continued his renovations			2
a spokesman for @entity21 's solicitor , @entity119 , said : ' officers gave repeated warnings that work must stop			2
' despite on occasions promises being made for this to happen , works continued regardless , stripping out much of the interior of the house , changing the proportions and the spaces , partially demolishing the outhouses and building			0
' irreversible damage has been caused to the brickwork and outhouse and original features appear to have been destroyed or removed from the building			0
' mr @entity7 admitted four offences of carrying out unauthorised work			1
@entity136 , architectural adviser for the @entity102 , said : ' the @entity102 is very pleased that the @entity137 has taken these offences seriously and imposed such a substantial fine on the building owner			0
' the @entity141 is an area of international significance in the history of town planning and architecture , and alterations to its buildings need to be carefully considered in order to retain its special characteristics			0
' mr @entity7 chose to ignore the planning regulations which exist to protect @entity6 from damaging alterations			1
' @entity7 has gained retrospective approval from the council for some of the changes but may be ordered to demolish the rest of his renovations			2
he applied for planning permission for some of his renovations only after he had begun construction and @entity21 later approved four of the changes			0
despite gaining retrospective permission , @entity7 still must pay the fine because he did not get approval before he carried out the work			2
mr @entity7 successfully applied for retrospective planning permission for several of his alterations council officials have told mr @entity7 that he must demolish the unauthorised conservatories but he is appealing over several refusals including the he had built and @entity21 may order for them to be destroyed if he loses his appeal			1
@entity7 will have to pull down the two large conservatories built at the back of his property following the magistrates ' ruling on tuesday last week			2
the community in the leafy suburb is divided as to whether he should be allowed to carry out his desired renovations			0
a neighbour said : ' i do n't see what the problem is			0
people spend a lot of hard earned money on their properties			0
who are we to tell him what to do with his house ? " it 's his house , why is it our business what he does to it ? ' there 's a division in the area between the old - school suburban people and the new money coming in			0
actually , i think the old school need to relax a bit			0
' one neighbourhood stalwart , who has lived there for more than 30 years , believes @entity7 should be forced to convert the property back to its original state			0
he said : ' with all due respect , you get people coming here who a £ 45,000 fine would be cheap			1
' there are @entity216 oligarchs and rich @entity217 moving to the area who could happily pay that fine in order to build whatever they want			0
' rather than a fine they should just be ordered to convert the property back to how it is			0
' @entity7 is yet to respond to request for comment .			0
