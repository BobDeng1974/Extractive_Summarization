sir @entity6 , who ran @entity16 's biggest supermarket for 14 years to 2011 - quadrupling annual profits - accused mr @entity8 of a ‘ failure of leadership ’			1
former @entity1 bosses : sir @entity6 ( left ) has traded blows with fellow ex-chief @entity8 ( right ) over who was to blame for the problems at the business which were to foreshadow its alarming decline in fortunes but mr @entity8 , while acknowledging the ‘ unprecedented success ’ under his predecessor , said ‘ critical challenges ’ had been building up at the time he took over			1
he was shown the exit last summer after overseeing sliding sales and a series of profit warnings that contributed to a dramatic fall in the share price			1
mr @entity8 was replaced by @entity35 , who earlier this month announced a dramatic shake - up including the closure of dozens of stores , the mothballing of others that were planned , and the sell - off of peripheral businesses			1
sir @entity6 told the @entity45 's @entity44 that all of the major supermarkets had struggled to some extent during the recession but that it seemed ‘ to have hit @entity1 the hardest ’			1
dropping : this graph shows @entity1 's share price falling as low as 165p recently from a 2010 high of 454p he added : ‘ people tried very hard to do the right thing , it clearly has not worked			2
in the end that 's a failure of leadership , not a failure of the business , not a failure of the people who work hard every day in the business			2
‘ when you 're the ceo , if it goes well you get credit , if it does n't go well you must take responsibility and @entity69 has taken that responsibility and paid the price with his job			0
‘ for whatever reason my successor went in a different direction and i think , it may or may not have been with the right reasons or intentions but it clearly did n't work			0
‘ the one thing that was missing was this great strength of @entity1 to take the pulse of the customer and know what they need today and be prepared to change and innovate in order to respond to customers ' needs now			0
‘ i think the culture did change under @entity69 and not for the better			0
i think if you talked to people who knew @entity1 , worked in @entity1 when i was there , actually the culture was pretty positive and it has to be			0
’ problems : sir @entity6 said that all of the major supermarkets had struggled to some extent during the recession but that it seemed ' to have hit @entity1 the hardest ' he said it was ‘ very damaging ’ for @entity1 to have lost the trust of customers that it would deliver the best price			1
‘ i think that some of that trust has been eroded which has meant that people have shopped around , not just actually from @entity1			0
’ mr @entity8 told @entity44 : ‘ although the company had enjoyed unprecedented success in the past , it was plainly the case when i took over @entity1 in march 2011 that it faced a number of critical challenges which had been building for some time			1
‘ it was recognised that this involved achieving cultural changes as well as business ones in order to move the business forward			0
’ among the legacy issues that mr @entity8 had to deal with during his tenure was the exit from the @entity122 @entity121 chain of @entity122 stores in 2013 , resulting in a £ 1.2billion charge			1
the venture had been launched under sir @entity6			1
sir @entity6 ’s comments come as the @entity44 investigation claimed that as sales fell at @entity1 there was a major fallout between the supermarket and one its biggest suppliers , @entity132			1
@entity133 launched under sir @entity6 : among the legacy issues that mr @entity8 had to deal with during his tenure was the exit from the @entity122 @entity121 chain ( above ) of @entity122 stores in 2013 , resulting in a £ 1.2billion charge this allegedly led the @entity139 cosmetics giant to threaten legal action after a disputed payment of around £ 1million			1
on that allegation , a @entity1 spokesman said : ' @entity132 is the largest cosmetics company in the world , with turnover of € 29bn ( £ 22.2billion ) generating profits of € 3.9bn ( £ 3billion ) in 2013			1
' as such it is a major supplier for @entity1 in all our markets and we value our relationship with them			0
differences do sometimes occur in the course of commercial relationships and we always aim to resolve them amicably , as we did in this case			0
” the programme also reported that the former chief financial officer , @entity157 , sent an internal email in 2012 warning about financial controls at the retailer after problems with commercial income were discovered in its @entity164 business			0
the email told finance staff : ‘ you should be in no doubt as to the seriousness [ of ] mis - declarations			0
’ this came less than two years before @entity1 ’s accounting scandal of september 2014 which led to senior staff being suspended and an investigation being launched by the @entity174			2
@entity175 over the decline of @entity1 ' i do feel sad , i , i spent my career at @entity1 and , i ’m particularly sad for the people in the business and actually the customers who come into the stores and , and spend their money every week			0
it did n’t have to be this way , i do n’t think i think all of the big four supermarkets have struggled to some degree through this recession , but it seems to have hit @entity1 the hardest			2
' on @entity8 ' for whatever reason my successor went in a different direction and i think , it may or may not have been with the right reasons or intentions but it clearly did n’t work and , and the one thing that was missing was this great strength of @entity1 to take the pulse of the customer and know what they need today and be prepared to change and innovate in order to respond to customers ’ needs now			2
' @entity202 ' well i , look people tried very hard to do the right thing , it clearly has not worked , in the end that ’s a failure of leadership , not a failure of the business , not a failure of the people who work hard every day in the business			0
when you ’re the ceo erm , if it goes well you get credit , if it does n’t go well you must take responsibility and @entity69 has taken that responsibility and paid the price with his job			0
' on the change of culture under @entity8 ' i think the culture did change under @entity69 and not for the better i think if you talked to people who knew @entity1 , worked in @entity1 when i was there , actually the culture was pretty positive and it has to be because it employs half a million people and you ca n’t make them do things you have to motivate them to do things , they ’ve got to want to do it			2
they ’ve got to believe in something similarly customers you ca n’t force them to come through your doors , they ’ve got to positively choose to come and suppliers to from all over the world , they ’ve got to invest in your business and the best way of getting them to do that is to actually motivate them so you need a very positive culture , it has to set high standards of course for safety on behalf of consumers , and also to be fair to good suppliers , you ca n’t reward a bad supplier and not give the business to a supplier who does things better			0
' @entity256 its reputation for having the best prices ' it ’s very damaging [ with reference to @entity1 losing its reputation for being the best on price ] … @entity1 is the biggest , people expect it to have the best prices for the products that they buy - and know they can trust @entity1 to deliver that and not have to shop around and check that they ’re getting the best deal and , and i think that some of that trust has been eroded which has meant that people have shopped around , not just actually from @entity1 but from the other big four supermarkets			2
' @entity273 ' i think it lost too much talent , it ’s a big company @entity1 and also very empowered , people were given responsibility and trusted to get on with their job so there was a big team of experienced leaders and , and too many of those were allowed to go in to short a period of time and so there was , there was a shortage i think of experience , the kind of experience you need to carefully navigate a business like @entity1 through this very turbulent and difficult period of this long , long recession with these changes in structure of retailing taking place			2
