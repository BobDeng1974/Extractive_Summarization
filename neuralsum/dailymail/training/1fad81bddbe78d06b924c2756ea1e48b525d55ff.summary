but last week , senior @entity12 judges defied the @entity13 ruling - leaving the judge free to decide whether @entity15 and @entity16 should die behind bars			1
having been found guilty of murder at the @entity20 last december , mr @entity18 gave @entity15 , 29 , a whole - life term while @entity22 , 22 , was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years			1
scroll down for family statement after sentencing sentencing : having been found guilty of murder at the @entity20 last december , mr @entity18 gave @entity15 , 29 , a whole - life term while @entity22 , 22 , was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years leading @entity12 judges ruled last week at a specially - constituted court that murderers who commit the most ‘ heinous ’ of crimes can be sent to prison for the rest of their lives by sentencing judges			1
backing the use of ‘ life - means - life ’ orders , a panel of five judges at the @entity43 increased the ‘ unduly lenient ’ 40 - year minimum being served by killer @entity46 , who murdered a man while on day release , to a whole - life term			1
and they dismissed a challenge by @entity52 , who murdered a child killer while in prison , against an order imposed in his case that he can never be released			0
the guidance from the appeal judges in @entity59 came in the wake of a decision by the @entity13 last year in an appeal by three murderers			2
choice : last week , senior @entity12 judges defied a @entity13 ruling - leaving the judge free to decide whether @entity15 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) should die behind bars giving the panel 's ruling , lord chief justice lord @entity68 said the court had held that the statutory scheme enacted by @entity73 which enabled judges to pass whole - life orders was ‘ entirely compatible ’ with the @entity76			1
the ruling has confirmed the possibility of a serial killer being given a whole - life prison term when she is sentenced tomorrow			2
@entity82 ( right ) , of @entity83 , pleaded guilty in november to murdering @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			0
she stabbed the men before dumping their bodies in march and april last year			0

the 31 - year - old woman is currently in custody awaiting sentence at the @entity20 tomorrow , along with her accomplices @entity95 , 47 , and @entity96 , 36 , as well as a third man , 55 - year - old @entity97			0
‘ judges should therefore continue as they have done to impose whole - life orders in those rare and exceptional cases which fall within the statutory scheme			2
‘ under the statutory scheme as enacted by @entity73 , the @entity102 has power to release a prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner 's release on compassionate grounds			0
’ sentencing in a number of high - profile criminal cases had been put on hold - including the terms to be handed out to @entity15 and @entity22 - pending the @entity43 's findings			2
the @entity12 - born extremists mowed @entity115 down in a car before hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers near @entity122 in south east @entity59 in may last year			0
with @entity15 's sentencing , there are now 54 prisoners serving whole - life terms in @entity12			1
the ruling by @entity68 , sir @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and mr justice @entity131 followed a successful appeal last july to the @entity13 by murderers @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			0
murder : @entity5 was mowed down in a car before being hacked to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers near @entity122 in south - east @entity59 in may last year a @entity142 spokesman said : ‘ in @entity135 and others v the @entity12 , the @entity13 did not say that whole - life sentences were incompatible with the convention , but there had to be the possibility of a review at some stage and current laws allowing for release in exceptional circumstances were unclear			1
‘ in ( last week ’s ) judgment , the @entity12 @entity43 has agreed with the @entity13 that whole - life sentences are not incompatible with the convention , but disagreed that the existing laws allowing for release in exceptional circumstances are unclear and sought to clarify what the law is			2
‘ @entity142 ’s @entity159 is now overseeing the implementation of the @entity135 judgment , as is the usual procedure ; the @entity12 government submitted an action plan to the @entity159 on 9 january and said it would provide further information as soon as possible			0
