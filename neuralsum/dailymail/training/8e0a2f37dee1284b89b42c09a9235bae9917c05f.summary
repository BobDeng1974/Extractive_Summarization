by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd the @entity1 is providing more @entity3 quarter finalists than any other league in the world - showing @entity6 's top clubs are still some of the best when it comes to world class quality			1
but while @entity11 sides are proving to be the most collectively successful in @entity12 so far , @entity13 - as they often do - are still top of the pile with 10 players left in the tournament			1
the @entity19 champions started the @entity3 with more players than anyone else , and many of them are still in with the national team - which alone boasts seven @entity13 stars - making it through to the quarter finals			2
@entity1 's finest : @entity26 and @entity27 both scored for @entity28 in their last - 16 tie spot on : @entity31 scored in the last round to help him and his @entity1 team mates advance surprise package : @entity36 might have been out on loan but he 's still @entity6 - based with @entity38 @entity39 : @entity40 and @entity41 are among a host of @entity1 players in @entity12 's squad @entity45 and @entity46 lead the way for the @entity11 , providing eight and seven players each - leaving them just behind the @entity19 champions			1
both @entity55 clubs , @entity51 rivals @entity50 and @entity53 's @entity52 all make it into the top 20 clubs too			0
@entity59 's @entity3 flop appears to have cost their league giants @entity60 and @entity62 places amongst the top ranking clubs - and if they had made it to this stage the traditional @entity66 rivals could boast eight and nine participants respectively			0
@entity71 finalists @entity72 amazingly fail to make the list of the @entity3 's top 20 clubs while @entity66 registers as just the fifth best league in the world behind @entity6 , @entity28 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
the figures fuel the long running argument over which country boasts the best league			0
while the @entity1 has long sold itself as the best around , back - to - back all - @entity19 and all - @entity85 @entity71 finals have brought the claim into question			0
and the @entity11 clubs will undoubtedly be able to show off even more top talent after what looks to be a busy summer of transfer activity for the big clubs , although none of the players listed here will be keen to talk about that sort of thing with the focus still on international glory			2
it 's a knockout : @entity103 's brilliant header helped knock out a load of @entity66 players with @entity59 @entity106 : @entity107 club : @entity107 with the @entity11 champions country : @entity112 's captain in @entity12 club : @entity114 playing on @entity115 country : @entity52 's right back on top : @entity119 gets above three fellow @entity1 players to punch the ball away for @entity79			0

@entity1 boasts *17* more quarter finalists than any other league
