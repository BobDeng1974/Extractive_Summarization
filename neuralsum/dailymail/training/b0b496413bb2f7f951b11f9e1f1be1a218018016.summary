by @entity0 published : 09:33 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 11:14 est , 11 october 2013 a petite personal trainer who competes in weightlifting competitions wants to prove you do n't have to be butch and burly in order to be powerful			1
@entity5 , 24 , from @entity6 , is 5ft 6in and can lift twice her own body weight of 10st 8lb			1
she currently trains six days a week so she can deadlift 125kg ( 19st 6lb ) , bench press 80kg ( 12st 6lb ) and squat 97.5kg ( 15st )			1
mrs @entity10 : @entity5 hopes to inspire more women to take up weightlifting loves to push herself : the personal trainer works out six days a week @entity5 , who only started powerlifting at the start of this year after qualifying to be a personal trainer in 2011 , hopes she can inspire other people to get involved with the sport			1
she told @entity19 : ' i want to show women that you can do something empowering like powerlifting whilst still remaining feminine			1
she added : ' to be clear - it 's not bodybuilding			2
bodybuilding is about size and definition of muscles , aesthetics and not about function			2
' @entity5 has launched her own business , @entity34 , with the support of her husband @entity36 , to help people tone up and get fit			1
but she wants to lead by example and show how you can build strength and fight fat through weighting lifting - an exercise regime that many women are loathe to follow in case it makes them look too masculine			2
strong : @entity5 can deadlift 125kg , bench press 80kg and squat 97.5kg good exercise : @entity5 recommends weigh lifting to people who want to get into shape ' a lot of women do n't realise how good it is for them , so i wanted to use myself as a guinea pig to help inspire them , ' she explained to the @entity58			1
' it helps women appreciate that you can do this but not end up looking like a bodybuilder			1
we simply do n't have enough testosterone to gain muscle quickly ... you do n't wake up one morning and look like @entity68			2
' ' a lot of women are put off lifting in general because they think it 's about getting " stacked " and ending up looking very masculine and bulky ' she added in an interview with @entity19 : ' a lot of women are put off lifting in general because they think it 's about getting " stacked " and ending up looking very masculine and bulky			2
' she admitted that even she was sceptical at first when it was suggested she try it			0
she said : ' i was reluctant as i did n't want to end up like a bloke but i did my research and looked at the different weight categories and saw that you do n't have to be huge to be strong			2
' i know for many people - both men and women - the weights area of a gym can be very intimidating but they are also intrigued to try it			1
' she added that women keen to drop a dress size and banish their ' muffin top ' should note that lifting weights is ' very good at keeping your body fat down and keeping you slimmer			1
' multi-talented : her other passion is singing and she 's in a band she explained : ' strength training boosts your metabolism so your body uses more fuel and stores less fat			0
' muscle mass is much firmer than body fat			0
if you have a thick layer of soft , squidgy fat on your body , you are likely to get overhang like ' muffin tops ' and ' bat wings ' because your clothes cut into the soft tissue			0
even slim people struggle with this if they have no muscle tone			0
a firmer surface ( that is muscle closer to the surface of the skin ) makes clothes look better and stops those horrendous @entity121			0
' another additional health benefit is stronger bones			0
she said : ' women 's changing hormone levels and often lighter body weight than men make us more prone to diseases like osteoporosis , particularly in post-menopausal women			2
strength training tells the bones that they are still needed			0
it stimulates the rebuilding process and makes them stronger			0
' for those she 's convinced to try lifting weights , @entity5 recommends first seeking advice from a professional via the accredited @entity141 ( @entity142 )			1
@entity5 intends to compete in a southern counties weightlifting competition in @entity145 this november			1
if successful , she will qualifying for a place in the @entity148 's national competition , where she could compete to be the country 's strongest woman			0
@entity5 said she 's always loved exercising and has been a ' gym bunny ' since the age of 16 and run a marathon			1
but exercise is not her only passion			0
she also loves to sing and her band , @entity157 , regularly perform at events including weddings			0
she sought a career in fitness over trying to break into the music industry as she felt the latter was too competitive			0
she also gets job satisfaction from inspiring people and pushing herself and others out of their ' comfort zone '			0
she said : ' i 've had a few women tell me that i inspire them to do more weights training , it 's so humbling and i love to see more ladies in the weights area			1

@entity5 , 24 , from @entity6 , can deadlift 125kg
the personal trainer wants inspire other women to lift weights
she said you do n't have to look like a bodybuilder or ' the hulk '
