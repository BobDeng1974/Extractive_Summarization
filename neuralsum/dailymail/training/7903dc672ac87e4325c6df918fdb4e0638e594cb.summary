@entity0 has been left out of @entity2 's squad for the @entity4 match against @entity5 on friday			1
the news capped a disappointing day for @entity0 , who scored just 16 and took two wickets but leaked 39 runs in the second @entity10 defeat by @entity11 at @entity12			1
it was the first time in five years that the 36 - year - old had featured for the county after last week signing a deal to play @entity18 cricket			0
oops : @entity0 was bowled for 16 as he prepares for the @entity18 blast with @entity2 seconds with the ball : @entity0 took two for 39 against @entity11 at @entity12 on thursday morning @entity0 took three wickets in a club game for @entity25 last saturday , but his inclusion in @entity2 ’s team for the semi-final of the @entity30 competition was a step up in class			1
however , he did not do enough to be selected in @entity2 ’s squad for friday ’s @entity34 against @entity5 in the @entity35 at @entity36			0
despite one fumble in the field the former @entity39 all - rounder , noticeably fitter than when he ended his international career in 2009 , did not look out of place			1
this ground , set amid the stunning backdrop of @entity45 in @entity46 , is a far cry from @entity48 , the scene of perhaps the @entity51 ’s greatest @entity39 performance during the 2005 ashes			0
at a stretch : the 36 - year - old got through his four overs easily enough as he continues his comeback he may not be as quick as back then , but there was still a reminder of the @entity0 of old when he bowled @entity60 in the fifth over			2
he picked up a wicket late on too , @entity11 ’s @entity63 caught in the deep			0
@entity0 then opened the batting alongside @entity65 , scoring a run - a - ball 16 before he was bowled attempting to sweep left - arm spinner @entity67			2
@entity2 never really looked likely to chase down their target of 186 , @entity11 eventually winning by 29 runs to reach the final			2
it had started so well : the all - rounder was scoring at a run a ball until he was bowled by spinner @entity67 big drawer : @entity0 is to be paid per spectator when he begins playing for the @entity78 first xi again however , far bigger prizes await both the county and @entity0 himself if he can make a successful comeback to the first team			1
on the basis of this performance , the jury is still out on whether he can still cut it at the top level			0
but it certainly promises to be fun finding out .			0

*ex-england* all - rounder played for @entity2 second xi vs @entity11
@entity0 took two for 39 in his four overs and looked sharp in the field
