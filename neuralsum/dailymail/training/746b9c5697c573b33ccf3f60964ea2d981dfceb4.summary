by @entity0 president @entity3 's ' flippant dismissal of the @entity4 ' is ' utterly beneath the dignity of the office , ' house speaker @entity1 said in a op - ed on sunday explaining why the @entity8 is suing the president			1
' i know the president is frustrated			0
the @entity13 people are frustrated , too , ' @entity1 wrote on @entity14			0
but that irritation does n't give the president the right to enact his own laws , the @entity16 leader argued			2
' that 's why , later this month , we will bring legislation to the @entity8 floor that would authorize the @entity8 to file suit in an effort to compel president @entity3 to follow his oath of office and faithfully execute the laws of our country			1
' house speaker @entity1 and @entity8 @entity16 are taking @entity3 to court			1
@entity1 is pictured here last month at the press conference when republicans took over the @entity8 in 2011 , the first - term @entity36 president and @entity16 congressman embraced the split party control over @entity40 and pledged to work together to resolve the issues plaguing the nation			1
as a display of his willingness to work with and not against @entity16 , the president even allowed the newly minted @entity8 speaker to play golf with him , an invite usually reserved for close friends and aides			2
@entity1 and @entity3 's once friendly relationship has deteriorated throughout the past four years , however , as the president has grown increasingly impatient with the opposing party 's reluctance to pass bills addressing his favored issues			2
with no end in sight to congressional gridlock , and the final term of his presidency nearly half way over , @entity3 has taken on a more aggressive approach to moving forward his legislative agenda , using executive orders to make reforms when and where he sees fit			1
the president says he has only used powers afforded to him as the country 's executive to make changes to administration policies			0
@entity16 claim only @entity40 has the authority to make changes to @entity13 laws , however , and the president is playing fast and loose with the @entity4			1
@entity1 , left , and @entity3 , right , were still on friendly terms when the president invited the @entity8 speaker to play golf with him in june of 2011			1
their relationship has greatly deteriorated throughout the last two years , however in a memo to fellow members of @entity40 last month , @entity1 said @entity3 is in violation of @entity86 of the @entity4 , which says the president ' shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed			1
' ' under the @entity4 ’s separation of powers principle , only the @entity40 has the power to legislate , ' @entity1 wrote			2
' on one matter after another during his presidency , president @entity3 has circumvented the @entity40 through executive action , creating his own laws and excusing himself from executing statutes he is sworn to enforce – at times even boasting about his willingness to do it , as if daring the @entity13 people to stop him			1
' on matters ranging from health care and energy to foreign policy and education , president @entity3 has repeatedly run an end - around on the @entity13 people and their elected legislators , straining the boundaries of the solemn oath he took on @entity113 , ' the @entity102 continued			1
in response to @entity1 's lawsuit the president definitely told @entity118 's @entity117 , ' i 'm not going to apologize for trying to do something while they 're doing nothing			2
' a few days later he mockingly told @entity16 who think he 's acting outside the law : ' so sue me			0
' in an op - ed that appeared on @entity14 's website over the weekend , @entity1 took on the president 's comment , calling his behavior ' disappointing			1
' he also defended @entity8 @entity16 ' record , saying they 'd passed more than 40 bills aimed at creating jobs that have died in the @entity134 , along with other @entity8 - led legislation			2
' i do n't take the @entity8 legal action against the president lightly			0
we 've passed legislation to address this problem ( twice ) , but @entity134 @entity36 , characteristically , have ignored it , ' @entity1 wrote			0
' there must be accountability , ' he said			0
' when there are conflicts like this -- between the legislative branch and the executive branch -- it is my view that it is our responsibility to stand up for this institution in which we serve , and for the @entity4			0
' @entity1 's lawsuit is perfectly timed to coincide with a previously scheduled congressional recess that will last from the first week of august through the first week in september			0
while the president and @entity36 are out campaigning against @entity16 obstructionism , @entity16 will be able to use the certain - to - pass suit as proof of the president 's malfeasance			1
republicans are expected to keep the @entity8 after this year 's elections , but there 's still four months on the clock			0
the president plans to actively campaign for his party in the coming weeks and is making trips to both @entity168 and @entity169 for fundraising events this week			0
former secretary of state @entity171 has also pledged to come out for @entity36 this fall after she finishes her book tour this month			0
@entity173 still enjoys a high approval rating , and candidates who receive the potential 2016 candidate 's public support could see a bump in the polls .			0

president @entity3 says republicans in @entity40 are keeping vital legislation from becoming laws and so he must go around @entity40 to make reforms himself
@entity1 and his @entity16 colleagues say the president does n't have the authority to change laws passed by @entity40 , and in doing so , he is violating the @entity4
the @entity8 is now suing the president for what it sees as *lawless* behavior , and the president does n't seem to care
the president 's *nonchalant* *attitude* about the @entity8 's suit stuck a nerve with @entity1 , and the @entity201 took the president on over the weekend in an op - ed
