changes to @entity2 's data sharing policies will make it almost impossible for presidential candidates to replicate @entity6 's success on the site			1
the 2012 reelection campaign won over voters under the age of 29 using an app that supporters could share with their friends			1
analysts could view each supporter 's friends list and construct a sophisticated database of who to target , rather than the traditional get - out - the - vote ring rounds made difficult as so few young people have listed phone numbers			1
however , as of april 2015 , third - party applications will only be able to see users who download the app , not their associates			1
clamp down : @entity2 has changed its data - sharing policies that will block third - party applications , such as this one used by @entity6 's 2012 campaign , from accessing users ' friends lists to target fresh voters experts who developed the sophisticated voter - targeting system , which was credited with redefining the limits of viral politics , claim the change will pose a significant challenge for the next cycle			1
' it 's a fairly significant shift , ' @entity41 , @entity6 's digital director in 2012 , told @entity43			1
' the thing we did that will be most affected - by which i mean rendered impossible - by the changes they 're making is the targeted sharing tool , ' @entity41 added			0
@entity6 's youth - focused campaign seemed to be shaken by early statistics that revealed half their swing - state voters under 30 did not have listed numbers			1
consequently , they opted to use @entity2 as a replacement for the traditional telephone directory			2
they raised more than $ 690 million over the internet and amassed more than 45 million @entity2 followers			2
@entity64 's campaign used a less sophisticated version of the system for just a few days before @entity67			1
@entity41 added : ' it 's extremely powerful for a campaign to be able to say to [ a user ] , " hey , here are your persuadable friends , ranked in order of where they live : @entity77 first , @entity79 second , et cetera			1
go share this video directly with them "			0
' ' groundbreaking ' : campaign experts branded @entity6 's digital voter - targeting in 2012 ' revolutionary '			1
the team directed adverts to supporters ' friends			0
analysts believed @entity64 ( right ) suffered by not using the strategy @entity90 , a @entity91 digital strategist who worked on @entity93 â€™s 2004 campaign , hailed the strategy as the future of outreach			0
next year 's change was announced by @entity2 in april this year after receiving complaints about privacy			1
' people want more control over sharing their personal information with apps , ' @entity100 , @entity2 's engineering manager , wrote in a blog post			1
he added : ' we 've heard from people that they 're often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app. ' so we 've updated @entity110 so that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves , including their friend list			0
' the @entity118 , set up earlier this year on @entity2 , will be able to gather a certain amount of data for the @entity121 before april - but the figures will be more than a year out of date by @entity67			2
meanwhile the @entity91 does not have any form of campaign page			0
however , @entity126 , software engineer for @entity6 's reelection bid , insists ' the writing has been on the wall for a long time '			1
' on the friend list issue , i was very skeptical that would last , ' he told @entity133			0
' even with access , the information was n't always complete enough for an accurate match against the voter file			0
' many users ' privacy settings blocked these fields , and there is increasing awareness of privacy issues in general			0
' he told @entity133 that @entity2 's understanding of its audience is far more sophisticated just three years on			2
after uploading an advert , an organization can trust @entity2 to serve it to users that will be interested			2
last chance : the @entity118 campaign page will be able to farm current supporters ' information and track friend lists before april 2015			2
but that information will be more than a year out of date by @entity67 ' many organizations were treating social as unlimited free earned media , ' he said			0
' the idea that an existing relationship with your supporters exempts you from having to pay the piper strikes me as a bit disingenuous			0
' we were successful at getting people to share content with friends who were higher - priority targets for us , but it was still very organic			2
' it 's hard to argue that it made a substantial difference , especially compared to the size and sophistication of our field , digital , and traditional media programs			0
' @entity2 will do whatever it takes to keep your feed enjoyable to read : they need to sell ads on it			0
ads are where the game is ( perhaps always was ) for campaigns			0

@entity2 will block third - party apps from accessing users ' friends lists
@entity6 's 2012 campaign used the site to find and target voters under the age of 29 who do not have listed phone numbers
experts say both parties will be hard - pressed to find new voter - targeting system that is as *effective*
