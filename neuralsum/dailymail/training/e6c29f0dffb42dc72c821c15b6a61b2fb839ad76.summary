by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 17:19 est , 24 november 2013 decision : @entity2 is deciding whether or not to defy @entity3 to bring in harsher migrant rules @entity2 is set to defy @entity6 rules by announcing a tough new set of obstacles for immigrants as @entity13 's @entity11 and @entity12 communities rapidly grow			1
people wishing to enter @entity13 will have to prove they have lived here for a year , up from three months , before they can receive benefits in one of the proposals expected to be unveiled			1
it is one of many goals the prime minister will put to the @entity22 in an attempt to negotiate a looser relationship with @entity3 ahead of a 2017 referendum			1
another policy would remove child benefits from the dependent children of migrant workers , sources claim			0
the move is a dramatic step that goes against @entity22 laws preventing member states from having one rule for their citizens requesting state hand - outs , and another for immigrants			1
if he goes ahead with the proposals , there is little @entity6 could do to stop him for years			1
the prime minister is today considering the move , which would spark yet another court battle with the @entity47 over benefit restrictions and potentially tarnish the country 's fragile relationship with the @entity22			1
currently , @entity13 is in court with @entity3 defending its right to subject migrants to ' additional tests ' in order to merit state hand - outs			1
however , the prime minister is motivated by mounting pressure from his own voters to guarantee strict control over @entity12 and @entity11 immigrants from january 1 , when they will be awarded the same freedom of movement as all @entity22 citizens			1
a poll for the @entity67 identified deep public anxiety about the ending of transitionary immigration restrictions on new @entity22 members @entity11 and @entity12 in january			2
the poll found that 82 per cent did not want citizens of the two countries to gain free access to the @entity13 , 85 per cent said they feared schools and hospitals could not cope and 76 per cent said young @entity13 could lose out on jobs			0
it also found more voters trust @entity80 on immigration ( 17 per cent ) than the @entity82 ( 11 per cent )			0
some 44 per cent said they trusted no party			0
sources claim he is encouraged by powerful nations such as @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 also vocalising concerns over the influx of eastern @entity6 immigrants			2
as of next year , the people of @entity12 and @entity11 will be free to work and claim benefits in @entity13			2
at home , pressure is mounting as at least 33 backbench @entity99 mps have so far signed a petition to stop @entity12 and @entity11 immigration altogether by 2018			0
a cabinet minister told @entity103 : ' the writing is on the wall for the way the commission is behaving			0
other countries have also had enough			0
' tension : the prime minister is driven by mounting tension in cities like @entity113 ( pictured ) caused by @entity115 migrants next week , a group of @entity82 will unveil their own ideas on how @entity13 could renegotiate its relationship with @entity6 ahead of the election			1
@entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 , from the @entity123 , have identified at least five major changes to @entity22 treaties they say should be at the heart of @entity13 ’s renegotiation			2
they include reforms to protect our financial services industry and an end to limits on work hours			0
@entity135 also want reforms to energy policy , the common agricultural policy , defence and immigration			0
ministers are already furious that the @entity47 has taken legal action to try to prevent welfare curbs on @entity145 @entity22 citizens			1
@entity3 claims making migrants show they are ‘ habitual residents ’ before they can claim child benefit , child tax credit , jobseeker ’s allowance and state pension credit breaks the right to free movement			2
migrants would have to be actively looking for work and have a realistic prospect of getting a job to claim unemployment benefits .			0

prime minister unveiling proposals to renegotiate relationship with @entity6
new arrivals would have to wait a year , up from 3 months , to get benefits
@entity22 rules *ban* *discriminating* between citizens and migrants ' hand - outs
