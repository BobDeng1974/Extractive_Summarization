by @entity0 published : 08:15 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 31 january 2013 vice president @entity1 will meet @entity3 's foreign minister @entity2 this weekend to try to spark new @entity5 - @entity3 talks over reducing their countries ' nuclear arsenals			1
the meeting will take place in @entity10 , @entity11 , before national security advisor @entity12 travels to @entity13 for a second round of talks next month			1
it comes after years of tension between the @entity5 and @entity3 that has included president @entity18 accusing the @entity5 of meddling in his country 's politics			2
reduction talks : a @entity3 @entity23 mobile nuclear missile is being moved at a strategic forces base near the central @entity3 city of @entity27 - @entity26 @entity28 also made unfavourable headlines at his last meeting with @entity3 prime minister @entity31 in march at a nuclear security summit in @entity33			1
the president was overheard saying he would have more ' flexibility ' to work with @entity3 on missile defence after the @entity5 presidential election			2
seizing on the comments , 43 @entity39 senators sent a letter to the president saying any concessions to the @entity3 would run counter to @entity5 safety and security , and contradict assurances @entity28 gave the @entity48 when he secured ratification of the @entity51 arms reduction treaty in december 2010			1
@entity3 fears of new @entity5 missiles at its doorstep in @entity56 have also helped to prevent further progress on nuclear arms reductions after the breakthrough @entity51 agreement three years ago			1
in an interview last week , @entity31 explained that @entity28 was signaling he would have more negotiating power on these subjects , but said that the two countries were still quite far apart			2
' any @entity5 president during his second term can take a stronger position and act in a more decisive manner , and that is exactly what @entity70 meant , ' @entity31 said			2
talks : vice president @entity1 ( left ) , pictured with president @entity28 ( right ) , will meet @entity3 's foreign minister @entity2 to negotiate reducing their countries ' nuclear arsenals far apart : @entity3 's foreign minister @entity2 will meet @entity1 in @entity10 , @entity11 , before national security advisor @entity12 travels to @entity13 for a second round of talks next month ' but if we talk about the subject itself , it is extremely difficult , and so far we do n't see any flexibility			1
there are no easy solutions in terms of anti-missile defense			2
' we have not changed our previous positions			2
the @entity5 has one opinion , and the @entity3 , unfortunately , has a different opinion			0
these positions are not getting any closer			0
' four years ago @entity1 spoke of the @entity28 administration 's desire ' reset ' @entity5 - @entity3 relations after years of deterioration during the @entity98 presidency			0
@entity39 fear the upcoming meetings with @entity3 leaders will propose unilateral reductions in @entity5 nuclear stockpiles or alterations to @entity5 missile - defence plans as an enticement for @entity3 to sit down for new talks			1
in february 2011 the @entity5 and @entity3 finalised a landmark arms treaty to limit the nuclear arsenals of the former @entity110 foes			1
the new start treaty limits each side to 1,550 strategic warheads , down from 2,200 and re-established a monitoring system that ended in 2009			0
the agreement , a cornerstone of @entity28 's efforts to ' reset ' @entity5 relations with @entity3 , came into effect as secretary of state @entity120 exchanged ratification papers with @entity3 foreign minister @entity2 in @entity10			1
@entity123 secretary - general ban ki - moon hailed it as a ' milestone on the road to our ultimate goal : achieving a world free of nuclear weapons '			0
the seven - year new start treaty was the first major revamping of nuclear disarmament deals since the @entity135 era			0
it was approved by the @entity48 in december 2010 after a bruising fight during which @entity28 pressed strongly for its passage			0
@entity3 ratified the deal the following month			0
the cable reported that in a letter to @entity1 @entity39 @entity142 , the chairman of the @entity143 , said : ' ahead of your unannounced discussions with @entity3 foreign minister @entity2 this weekend in @entity10 , and prior to mr @entity12 's forthcoming february discussions in @entity13 , i write seeking your assurance as to president @entity28 's plans for future potential @entity5 arms reductions			1
' @entity142 and other @entity39 are worried that the @entity28 administration may not pursue a new treaty , but instead strike a deal with @entity3 that wo n't have to be approved by @entity155			0
@entity12 intends to transmit a personal letter to @entity18 from @entity28 ' articulating his plans for further @entity5 arms reductions and perhaps even agreements about @entity5 missile defenses to entice @entity3 to the negotiating table , ' @entity142 wrote , according to @entity161			1
the @entity163 's @entity162 ( @entity164 ) , which reports to acting under secretary for arms control @entity166 , issued a report last november spelling out how further nuclear reductions might be achieved , with or without the cooperation of the @entity48 or the @entity3			2
the @entity164 presented options for three scenarios : ' completing the @entity51 reductions early ; working with @entity3 on transparency and verification of nonstrategic nuclear weapons ; and engaging in parallel nuclear arms reductions to levels below @entity51 , if @entity3 is willing to reciprocate			1
' ' unilateral and coordinated reductions can be quicker and less politically costly ... relative to treaties with adversarial negotiations and difficult ratification processes , ' the report stated			0
administration critics are already preparing to fight any attempt by the @entity186 to push forward with nuclear reductions absent the consent of the @entity48			0
' senators should block end - runs around the @entity192 's treaty clause , ' wrote @entity98 administration officials @entity193 and @entity195 in a @entity196 op - ed last month			0
' an informal agreement would prevent effective congressional scrutiny of the unwise rush to slash the nuclear arsenal , @entity5 's ultimate national - security safeguard and a crucial buttress of world peace			0

meeting between *statesmen* will take place in @entity10 , @entity11
it is first talks since @entity51 arms reduction programme was agreed
