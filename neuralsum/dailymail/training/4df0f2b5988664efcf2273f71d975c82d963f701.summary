by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 10:17 est , 18 june 2013 a woman ' kettled ' by police , before being filmed and told to hand over personal details during a 2011 trade union rally was treated unlawfully , the @entity1 said today			1
the @entity6 argued they were legally entitled to obtain , and retain , the information for crime prevention purposes before allowing @entity9 to leave			2
but @entity10 and mr justice @entity11 , sitting in @entity12 , ruled they had acted outside their powers			0
@entity15 will now have to delete any records of @entity17 taken at the demo , including on film and camera			1
case : @entity9 was observing demonstrators attending an anti-cuts rally in @entity12 in 2011 when she was kettled and not allowed to leave until giving her personal details ' the absence of any statutory power to obtain identification in the circumstances in this case establishes conclusively the unlawfulness of the police action in requiring ( ms @entity9 ) to be filmed and give her name and address and date of birth before she was released from containment , ' justice @entity10 said			1
conclusion : mr @entity10 found : ' it was not lawful to require identification to be given and submission to filming as the price for release ' ms @entity9 , a law graduate and caseworker at the @entity42 , was corralled in a crowd of protesters for two hours on november 30 2011 at a trade union march against public sector pension cuts			1
she was acting as a legal observer			1
the march , which started at @entity49 in central @entity12 , proceeded to @entity50 in the @entity51			0
some of the crowd , including ms @entity9 , were blocked in at nearby @entity53			2
police said the containment was ' necessitated by a reasonably apprehended imminent breach of the peace '			0
while the judges agreed that containment was necessary , they declared being filmed and having to give the police personal details as ' the price of release ' a step too far			1
their ruling will be welcomed as important backing for the freedom to protest without the ' chilling ' effect of being forced to hand over particulars			0
the judge declared : ' it was not lawful for the police to maintain the containment for the purposes of obtaining identification , whether by questioning or filming			0
' it follows that it was not lawful to require identification to be given and submission to filming as the price for release			0
' ms @entity9 , who is now training to be solicitor , was allowed out of the kettle some two hours later at 5.52pm			2
the filming and taking of personal details occurred when the police assessed that containment was no longer necessary			1
ms @entity9 said some 100 detainees were searched for ' offensive weapons or dangerous instruments ' before their release - but were also told they had to give their personal details to obtain their freedom			1
proceedings : ms @entity9 was forced to take the case to the @entity1 because the police refused to accept they acted illegally she was ' tagged ' - filmed close up under bright lights - for identification purposes by a civilian employee of the police and gave her name , address and date of birth to a police officer			1
demonstrators were filmed ' individually in close - up , from front and back ' and the images linked with their personal details			2
in those circumstances , @entity110 8 of the @entity111 , which protects private and family life , became engaged , said the judge			0
while the @entity6 had a published policy of overt filming and photography , ' there is no such published policy on the retention of images and personal details '			2
so the interference with the claimant 's rights enshrined in @entity110 was not ' in accordance with the law '			0
a @entity6 spokesman said later : ' we are aware of the judgment today and will now give it our full consideration and take forward any learning			0
' @entity134 , legal director for campaign group @entity135 , said : ' it should n't have needed a court to tell the police they ca n't require personal details and compulsory filming before releasing people from a kettle			1
any law student could have worked that out			0
the courts have been clear that kettling is a last resort - it should never be abused as a tool for bullying demonstrators			0

@entity9 was a legal observer at a 2011 trade union rally
she was in a group kettled and forced to give personal details before release
two judges sitting at the @entity1 found in her *favour* today
@entity15 must delete any records of @entity17 taken at the demo
