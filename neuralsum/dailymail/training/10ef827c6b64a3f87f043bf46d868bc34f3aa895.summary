@entity0 , her daughters and her mother plan a week - long solo visit to @entity4 this month that includes meetings with @entity4 's first lady and high school and university students - and that will likely cost @entity11 taxpayers millions of dollars			1
president @entity0 and his family have come under heavy scrutiny for the unprecedented high travel costs during his time in office - and a week - long trip to @entity4 for four members of the @entity26 , members of the @entity13 and other members of the @entity16 staff will likely cost several millions of dollars			1
the president 's pricey travels have become so controversial that @entity29 was forced to sue the @entity13 and @entity30 to get them to turn over records on the amount of taxpayer money used to fly the @entity26 all over the world - in many cases for vacations or fundraisers - over the last two years of his administration			1
@entity40 : @entity0 and her daughters @entity42 ( left ) and @entity43 ( center ) will travel to @entity4 this month what the records show was startling			2
according to @entity29 , it cost more than $ 11 million for the president and his wife to travel to @entity50 to attend @entity52 's funeral in december of last year			1
according to the @entity53 , the @entity43 were only in @entity50 for ' less than 13 hours			1
' but that trip was nothing compared to a 2013 visit the @entity43 made to the @entity57 , which reportedly cost tax payer more than $ 100 million			1
on the 2013 trip , some of the reported expenditures include the stationing of a @entity65 aircraft carrier off the coast of @entity50 equipped with a fully staffed medical trauma center , military cargo planes to fly a fleet of 56 support vehicles to transport the @entity43 - complete with 14 limousines and three trucks carrying bulletproof glass to cover the windows of the hotels where the @entity43 were to stay - and fighter jets that flew in shifts to provide coverage over the president 's airspace for the entire trip			1
in june , the first lady went to @entity82 for a two - day trip			2
the cost to taxpayers : $ 5 million			1
@entity0 reportedly stayed at a $ 3,300 - per - night hotel in @entity87 , and needed to book 30 rooms at the posh @entity89 for her staff and security detail			2
expensive : travel expenses for the @entity26 have cost @entity11 taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars over the last two years alone for two vacations the @entity43 took in 2013 - one to @entity95 and one to @entity98 - records show that it cost taxpayers a whopping $ 7,396,531 in flight expenses alone			1
that figure also includes travel expenses for the president 's trip to @entity105 to file the @entity106 with @entity107			1
during an august trip to @entity105 , during which @entity0 attended a party held by @entity113 fundraiser @entity111 and again appeared on the @entity106 , taxpayers paid more than $ 2 million in travel expenses for the president and his security detail			1
the president will not be joining his family on what will be the first lady 's first visit to the @entity123 economic powerhouse			2
in an announcement monday on the @entity16 blog , the first lady says a @entity4 visit is important because it is the most populous country in the world , with more than 1.3 billion people , and is an important world actor			2
mrs. @entity0 will travel from march 19 - 26 , spending several days in the capital of @entity133 before stops in the central city of @entity136 and the southwestern city of @entity138 , the @entity16 said			0
her schedule includes a meeting with @entity141 , the wife of @entity4 president @entity142			0
tonight : taxpayers footed the more than $ 2 million bill so @entity0 could appear on the @entity106 with @entity107 mrs. @entity0 missed meeting @entity4 's first lady last june when the newly installed @entity142 , accompanied by his wife , traveled to @entity105 for a summit with president @entity148			1
the presidential - level meetings were around the time of @entity152 's 12th birthday , and the @entity16 said mrs. @entity0 stayed in @entity153 with family			0
she wrote a letter to @entity141 welcoming her to the @entity11 and expressing hope that they would meet soon in @entity4 , the @entity16 said			0
in @entity4 , mrs. @entity0 will focus on the power and importance of education , including in her own life , during visits to a high school and a university in @entity133 , and a high school in @entity138			0
she recently began an effort to encourage @entity11 's young people , including some of the most economically disadvantaged , to pursue a college education			0
on past trips outside the @entity11 , she also has made the same point to students from the host country			0
mrs. @entity0 grew up in a poor @entity174 family , but earned degrees from two of @entity11 's best universities			0
@entity50 : it cost taxpayers $ 11 million when the @entity43 went to @entity50 for @entity52 's funeral			1
they were there for 13 hours in @entity4 , she will be accompanied by daughters , @entity43 and @entity42 , and her mother , @entity184 , who lives at the @entity16			1
president @entity0 will not be on the trip ; he is scheduled to depart the @entity11 later that week for stops in the @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191			2
mrs. @entity0 is encouraging @entity11 students to follow her trip on social media and the @entity16 website , where she will post a daily travel blog			0
in preparation for the trip , she scheduled a visit tuesday to a @entity153 charter elementary school with a @entity4 - immersion , international baccalaureate program			0
in her blog post , the first lady said countries today are no longer isolated and face many of the same challenges , whether it is to provide students with a good education , combat hunger , poverty and disease or address threats like climate change			0
' these issues affect every last one of us , so it 's critically important that young people like you learn about what 's going on not just here in @entity11 , but around the world , ' mrs. @entity0 said			0
' because when it comes to the challenges we face , soon , all of you will be leading the way			0
' ' that 's why everywhere i go , whether it 's here in the @entity11 or abroad , i meet with young people to hear about your challenges , hopes and dreams â€” and that 's what i 'll be doing in @entity4 as well , ' she said			0
' i 'll be focusing on the power and importance of education , both in my own life and in the lives of young people in both of our countries			0
' history : first families going back to @entity251 have visited @entity4 on diplomatic trips , including the family of @entity254 , seen here among recent first ladies , @entity255 traveled to @entity4 with president @entity257 , and @entity133 was the place where @entity259 made her now famous declaration at a @entity262 women 's conference in 1995 that ' women 's rights are human rights			2
' mrs. @entity0 's trip will be a highly visible endeavor , but the fact that she 's taking the rest of her family suggests ' she 's not going in search of a crusade of one sort or another , ' said @entity274 , a senior fellow in the @entity275 at the @entity276 think tank in @entity153			2
' the clear intent here is not to touch any particular hot buttons			0
' mrs. @entity0 's previous solo travels outside the @entity11 as first lady were to @entity283 in 2010 , and @entity284 and @entity50 in 2011 .			1
