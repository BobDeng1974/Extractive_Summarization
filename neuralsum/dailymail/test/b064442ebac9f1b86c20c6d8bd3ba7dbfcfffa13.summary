sometimes , putting up a billboard just is n't quite enough - so a group of @entity3 entrepreneurs have come up with a new way to get you message out : on the breasts of a beautiful woman			1
companies @entity9 and @entity11 have popped up in @entity3 offering the eyebrow raising service and are , by all accounts , causing quite a stir			1
indeed , it has already caught the attention of one big company , which jumped at the chance to advertise its whoppers			2
cleavage : @entity22 has become one of the first big companies to take advantage of thi type of advertising from the heart of @entity3 : two companies now offer to write on a woman 's cleavage and take a snap @entity22 's @entity3 branch posted a picture of a woman with ' i love @entity22 ' emblazoned across her chest , courtesy of @entity39 , on its @entity40 , the country 's version of @entity42			1
the message above reads : ' do you want your name to be written here ? ' every week the most active participant will get such a named postcard from us ! ' not only our whoppers are prepared on fire , everything we have is on fire as well ! ' and it has certainly brought them a fair amount of attention , with hundreds of ' likes ' and countless comments - although they are not all positive			2
what 's more , as advertising campaigns go , it is incredibly cheap : for as little as $ 6 , or £ 4 , they promise to get your message across in a way which is certain to grab attention			1
versatile : the picture can then be used as either a personal message , or advertising , and cost just £ 4 eyebrow raising : but the use of a woman 's cleavage as advertising space has not been universally popular according to the @entity75 , @entity9 was set up earlier this year , with @entity11 following in its footsteps more recently			1
both offer a similar service , asking people to send their messages in , at which point a model writes the message on her breasts and then takes the requisite photo			1
the @entity87 website for @entity11 boasts : ' stave off boredom ! send your communication on the bosom of @entity3 beauties – knock your friends ’ socks off , advertise your business and make unforgettable gifts ! ' say hello from the heart of @entity3 ! ' boasts : ' knock your friends ’ socks off , advertise your business and make unforgettable gifts , ' says @entity98 @entity99 , co-founder of @entity11 , revealed to @entity100 the company gets a range of requests for messages - from ' farewell , @entity105			2
with best wishes for your wedding day ' to ' do not play with heart - it is one			0
play with boobs - there are two of them '			0
the women , he reveals , are not all professional models			0
' we invite not only professional models who are interested in our project and like our idea , but beautiful girls , ' he explained			0
' some of our models we find in professional community - we have photographers in our team - and some of them we find through social networks , others find us themselves			0
' however , as one @entity131 user points out , when advertising ' it is necessary find something that is interesting to everyone ' - and this certainly is not .			0

two @entity3 companies have started offering *unusual* service this year
one message can cost as little as $ 6 , or £ 4 , so it is a cost *effective* method
@entity142 *fastfood* chain posted an ' advert ' to its @entity3 page this month
but *critics* have pointed out it is unlikely to have mass *market* appeal
