by @entity0 published : 16:14 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 16:41 est , 16 october 2013 @entity1 may have become a modern byword for figure - flattering undergarments - but as far as the a-list are concerned , there 's a new line of shapewear whittling bodies down to red carpet size			1
according to the creator of @entity17 , celebrities including @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 are all shunning the market leader in favor of her new , more luxurious alternative that uses couture techniques to shape the body			1
founder and designer , @entity25 , tells @entity26 that the a-list demand is thanks to @entity30 's celebrity stylists			1
red carpet essential : celebrity stylists are now instructing clients to wear shapewear by @entity17 ( pictured ) beneath their formalwear ' here in @entity30 where we are based , @entity17 has become an essential tool with all the major stylists dressing stars for the red carpet , ' she said			1
indeed , @entity41 , who dresses @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity45 girl @entity44 , is one of that number			0
she told @entity47 : ' they ’re sexy			0
they cover all problem areas and add an extra layer of confidence when they ’re on the red carpet			0
' shapewear secret : actress @entity13 ( left ) and @entity55 ( right ) both pictured wearing @entity17 slips beneath their dresses celebrity fan : @entity58 wore the @entity60 bra as a top during her tour earlier this year ms @entity25 says the secret to her success is that her designs not only look good , but shape the body and feel comfortable enough to wear all day long - something that she felt did n't already exist in the marketplace			1
' there were pieces that had gussets , scooped out busts to allow for your own bra – and numerous images of black bras with a nude bicycle short and suspenders on top , ' she recalled			0
' how can that be sexy when you undress ? ' form and function : @entity82 uses couture techniques learned working in @entity85 's biggest fashion houses nor are they typically comfortable : ' i often hear stories of women wearing shapewear they feel incredibly self conscious in , and have ended up taking it off during an evening out to make themselves feel better , ' she added			1
ms @entity25 says her goal was ' about designing something that gave you an instant va - va - voom bombshell factor '			1
she says she uses ' couture techniques that i learned working in @entity85 's biggest fashion houses to ensure that the items create form and not just flatten			1
most shapewear out there flattens your best bits ! ' what 's more , each undergarment is intended to look attractive with or without clothes			1
' when you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror i want you to like what you see , ' she says			0
and it seems the appeal of @entity17 has gone beyond the a-list			2
already , ms @entity25 's shapewear is being stocked by @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 - and customers ca n't get enough			1
the @entity122 , a feature of several items in the @entity17 range , has been nicknamed ' the boob job in a bra ' by fans			2
it was sported by @entity58 throughout her latest tour , and has even become an unlikely hit among nursing mothers			0
' it truly shocks them because not only are they feeling sexy and shaped without a wire , but they are able to wear the bra even after they have finished nursing and back to their original size , ' the designer says			2
the @entity145 high - waisted brief has also won enthusiastic responses			2
' recently i woke up to an email from a major @entity150 retailer asking for a special order of 60 of our @entity145 high - waisted brief , ' she said			2
' the order was for a customer who had tried the @entity145 and fell in love with them so much that she ordered 60 for herself ! ' under where ? ms @entity25 says some women want to wear the @entity161 slip as outerwear splashing out : one customer loved the @entity164 so much , she ordered 60 pairs for herself ms @entity25 says that while her customer is typically younger , she has fans in their late seventies			1
it is unlikely that the septugenarians are those embracing the @entity171 as outerwear though			1
' some women want to wear the @entity174 out on its own with nothing over the top , and many have ! ' as for herself , the designer says she lives in the bras and bodysuits , particularly ' for sheer blouses i ca n't button up fully and to feel confident in jeans when my pesky muffin top is showing ! ' putting it to the test : @entity190 was curious to know if @entity17 could genuinely deliver something new to shapewear fans at 5ft 4in and a @entity194 size 6 , i can usually benefit from shapewear beneath my more body - conscious clothes			1
@entity1 is my go - to , but i was curious to know if @entity17 could genuinely deliver something new to shapewear fans , who are inundated with a new ' miracle ' product on an almost daily basis			1
i was sent the @entity202 's signature piece - to road - test			1
it is a full - body garment that looks like a rather short , tight , cleavage - baring minidress			2
getting into it was straightforward			0
it has a zip at the back , and once i 'd wiggled it up , my less - than - toned midriff instantly looked more streamlined			2
my concern , though , was the built - in bra , usually something i avoid as i usually require more serious support			1
but @entity25 says that the @entity17 designs fit every size , and can be worn by anyone with or without a bra			1
in the interests of research , i initially tried the @entity161 without			0
but while it definitely had a ' boob job effect ' , i felt too unsupported to go without a bra , so ended up wearing it as well as the slip			0
my clingy leather / wool pencil skirt , i felt , would be the toughest challenge for the @entity17 - it is gorgeous , but unforgiving on my gym - phobic body			2
perhaps this would be the key to making it more of a wardrobe staple			0
the result ? the usually tight skirt was verging on loose - i was astonished			0
i felt like i 'd lost a couple of inches from my waistline			0
result ! in terms of comfort , the @entity17 fared well too			0
it 's not as comfortable as wearing no shapewear at all , but distinctly more forgiving than any other shapewear i 've worn			0
that first day i wore it through several meetings and an awards do - it did n't feel restrictive after eating and i was n't itching to take it off at the end of the night			0
the verdict ? i loved the @entity17 , but it 's pricey at $ 169			0
the closest @entity1 equivalent is the @entity255 open - bust full slip , at $ 88			0
if you 're prepared to splash out though , it 's worth every penny .			0

celebrity fans of @entity171 include @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15
the label 's founder , @entity30 - based designer @entity25 , says the a-list demand is thanks to support from celebrity stylists
