@entity0 has wasted no time cashing in on the lecture circuit as it was revealed today that she will be charging $ 200,000 per speech			1
the massive fee means that she will be making more from a two - hour lecture than she did in a year as secretary of state			1
the announcement that mrs @entity0 has hired a top talent agency to represent her as she begins to give paid speeches following her departure from the @entity11 came earlier this week , but her $ 200,000 asking price was only reported on wednesday			2
next gig : former secretary of state @entity0 has signed up with a talent agency and is commanding $ 200,000 per lecture , each of which will only last between one and two hours according to @entity19 , that puts her in the same league as her husband former president @entity21 who is so in - demand that he can command the six - figure fee			1
the volume of the sum is made clear when looked at in comparison to her salary for a year as secretary of state , which was $ 186,000			1
mrs @entity0 is now represented by the @entity28 which is known for getting famous politicians and newsmakers plum gigs on the lecture circuit			1
the venture is her first formal decision about what she is going to do now that she is no longer working , though she is widely considered to be the @entity37 front runner should she decide to run for the presidency in 2016			1
her decision to attach her name to his particular @entity42 - based agency comes as little surprise since her husband former president @entity21 has long been represented by the group since he left office in 2000			0
the move was clearly a lucrative one , as he made $ 75.6million from 2001 to 2010 from speaking engagements , making $ 10.7million in just 2010 alone			0
president @entity21 is not the only big name with the agency , as his former vice president @entity53 has been booking $ 175,000 gigs through their connections , and former @entity42 mayor and @entity58 presidential candidate @entity57 regularly brings in $ 100,000 per event			2
following suit : former vice presidents @entity62 ( left ) and @entity53 ( right ) are also represented by the @entity28 and are said to command $ 100,000 per speaking engagement @entity21 - an average of $ 181,000 , but in 2010 alone he earned $ 10.7million and a total of $ 75.6million between 2001 and 2010 @entity53 - $ 175,000 @entity66 - while working as a senator prior to his presidential bid in 2004 , @entity66 averaged $ 1,400 per speach @entity62 - $ 75,000 and first class travel for a three - person entourage @entity57 - $ 100,000 per event and he made $ 9.2million on a speaking tour from 2006 to 2007 @entity73 - $ 75,000 plus transportation @entity75 - $ 14,000 @entity76 - $ 200,000 per appearance along with the use of a private jet @entity80 earned $ 600,000 from @entity81 in @entity82 for an undisclosed number of events @entity85 - ' $ 20,000 to walk the red carpet former vice president @entity62 , former senators @entity87 and @entity88 , @entity90 campaign strategist @entity89 and former secretary general of the @entity93 @entity92 are all represented by the @entity28 as well			2
her exact asking price has not been reported , but @entity95 asserts that she ' will likely do some speeches for no fee for causes she champions , and expects to occasionally donate her fees for charitable purposes '			2
while keeping mum about any future presidential plans , mrs @entity0 has said that she plans to write another book , this time about her work as secretary of state			1
publishing house @entity107 reportedly paid the former first lady an $ 8million advance on her first book , @entity111 , which she published in december 2000			0
with any and all positions that she decides to take , she will have to weigh the optics of if it would look appropriate for a presidential candidate			2
that said , another concern is shoring up a steady income , because it does n't come cheap to live like the @entity119 and six - figure speaking fees will certainly help			0
equal standing : @entity0 is reportedly asking for $ 200,000 per speech which is the same fee that @entity124 charges though there were early reports that they might buy a house in the @entity130 area of @entity131 , it appears now that they will hustle between their current residences in @entity133 and @entity134 , a quiet town in the suburbs of @entity42			0
she is also expected to either work with her husband 's @entity137 or start her own , though no decisions about that have been made at this point			0
the only thing that mrs @entity0 has publicly confirmed is that she plans to rest after a very taxing four years of traveling to 112 different countries			1
as mrs @entity0 remains coy about her political prospects , her potential competitors are being very blatant in their fundraising attempts			0
on the @entity58 side , both @entity148 governor @entity147 and @entity150 senator @entity149 have raised significant sums for their campaign war chests in recent weeks			0
mr @entity147 attended a fundraiser in his honor at @entity159 founder @entity158 's @entity157 home , and mr @entity149 raised $ 100,000 by selling water bottles with his name on them , playing on his thirst - quenching gaffe during the @entity165 rebuttal .			0
