disbelief : commander @entity0 has campaigned for the @entity2 government to introduce a specific @entity4 medal for survivors of the convoys the @entity2 @entity4 convoy heroes who risked their lives to help transport crucial supplies to @entity10 during @entity11 have been told they can not accept a medal for valour from the country			1
the @entity10 @entity15 wrote to survivors of the notoriously perilous sea campaign - who saw 3,000 of their comrades killed - to inform them it intended to award them with the @entity20 as a symbol of the country 's gratitude			1
but the @entity24 has blocked the @entity10 's government 's plans to honour @entity2 's @entity4 heroes , because it said it would break rules surrounding the acceptance of medals			1
@entity10 has already awarded the @entity32 medal to veterans from @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity36 for their role in the @entity4 convoys , which ferried vital supplies and munitions to the @entity41 to help fight off the advance of @entity43 between 1941 and 1945			1
commander @entity0 , 92 , who has been lobbying the @entity2 government to introduce a specific @entity4 medal for the past 15 years , expressed disbelief at this latest blow to the surviving sailors			2
' i can not believe the @entity24 , @entity49 , is doing this , ' he told the @entity51			0
' this is not a campaign medal , this is a medal for valour			0
he 's saying that what we did out there , what we went through , had no valour at all			0
' he said the @entity10 government should go ahead and award the @entity32 medal			2
' what i say is , why do n't they give it to us ? what would our government do ? take it off us ? ' @entity70 mp @entity69 branded the decision an ' absolute disgrace ' and a ' slur on this country '			0
the @entity24 said permission to accept a foreign award could not be given if a @entity2 award had been given for the same services , and pointed out that the @entity4 convoy veterans were eligible for the @entity11 @entity80			1
commander @entity0 has previously dismissed suggestions the @entity80 - created in recognition of a separate @entity85 campaign and extended to include those who served on the convoys - was adequate recognition for survivors of the terrifying trips as he continued to press for a specific @entity4 medal			0
a statement from the @entity24 said : ' the rules on the acceptance of foreign awards state that for permission to be given for an award to be accepted , there has to have been specific service to the country concerned and that that service should have taken place within the previous five years			1
‘ additionally , permission can not be granted if they have received , or are expected to receive , a @entity2 award for the same services			2
' the @entity10 @entity15 said the @entity24 decision was a matter of ' deep regret ' , and added it hoped the @entity2 government would disregard the ' bureaucratic formality ' and change its position			1
@entity10 run : thick snow and ice covers the deck of @entity117 in the @entity4 in february 1943 last year commander @entity0 told of the sense of betrayal among @entity2 's @entity4 convoy survivors over @entity122 's failure to introduce a specific @entity4 medal			1
while in opposition the @entity124 pledged to recognise the veterans with a dedicated commemorative medal if elected			0
but after becoming prime minister mr @entity122 pointed to the extension of the @entity130 to those who served in the @entity4 as a mark of the nation 's gratitude			2
but campaigners argue that 95 per cent of the 66,500 men who served in the @entity137 had already earned the @entity80 before being conscripted on to the dreaded ‘ @entity138 ’			0
commander @entity0 said that most @entity4 sailors had been drafted from the @entity140 and so would have been eligible for the @entity80 regardless .			0

@entity10 wants to award the @entity20 to @entity2 's @entity4 convoy veterans as a symbol of the country 's gratitude
the @entity24 has blocked the move as it said it would break the rules surrounding acceptance of medals
the @entity10 *embassy* has expressed its ' deep regret ' at decision , which was *slammed* by veterans
@entity11 heroes risked their lives time and again *ferrying* crucial supplies to the @entity41 to help fight off the advance of @entity43
