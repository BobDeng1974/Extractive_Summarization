for a manager with a reputation for caution , it seemed a very odd decision to leave out @entity5 and plump for a teenager with one cap			1
even as @entity9 tried to explain his reasons he did not seem convinced , and yet nobody will have paid more attention to these two left backs set on radically different trajectories			0
@entity15 , at 18 , is rising at a breathtaking rate , a seemingly unstoppable force scouted by every top club in @entity19			1
finished : @entity5 , who has 107 @entity21 caps , has retired from international football changing of the guard : @entity15 will go to the @entity24 ahead of long - time left back @entity5 in public , @entity25 has been ultra-supportive of a man who has served him loyally			1
the @entity29 manager has tried his best to credit @entity30 rather than find fault with @entity5 , but the @entity5 of old is not replaced at left back by a right back			1
no more than the cole of old is replaced at international level by @entity35			0
no more than the cole of old spends half an hour struggling to contain @entity38 ’s @entity37			0
@entity5 ’s form has slipped from its very high standards			2
it is a trend that started last year and continued into this , amplified by the damaged confidence which comes from losing your aura of invincibility			0
@entity25 and @entity9 have agreed on this			0
that does not mean he is a spent force			0
@entity5 remains a fine player and an attractive free transfer , but @entity29 ’s defenders have all been impressive within @entity25 ’s strong unit			1
if he had played left back at @entity57 this season , the physical limitations of a 33 - year - old with delicate ankles would have been more severely tested			2
@entity25 wants his full backs to defend , not bomb on , and protects them with midfield enforcers in @entity62 and @entity63			0
@entity9 will want more from his left back , but tactical deliberations are beside the point			0
@entity5 has lost his @entity24 place because he was not good enough to keep his @entity29 place			1
by the time he returned in late april , the @entity21 manager ’s mind was made up			2
give youth a chance : @entity9 announced his @entity21 squad for the @entity24 on monday where next ? @entity5 is resigned to leaving @entity29 this summer as his contract ends during @entity5 ’s absence , @entity9 studied @entity15 and became convinced he was ready for international football			1
his emergence also fits into a broader philosophy which can serve @entity21 well			2
@entity9 wants to do well at the @entity24 but expectations are low and he can start to extend his vision , because failing to reach @entity81 2016 in @entity82 looks almost impossible given @entity21 ’s group			1
here is a rare luxury			0
@entity9 can start by enveloping the best of the young players into the framework and giving them time to train together and play together			0
at the same time , @entity15 and @entity35 are exciting players			1
they are quite capable of rewarding the @entity21 manager for discarding his cloak of caution			2
finished : @entity5 retired from international football having been left out of @entity21 's @entity24 squad uncertain future : @entity97 earned a new contract , but @entity5 and @entity99 are yet to receive an offer			1

@entity5 was left out of the *23* - man @entity21 @entity24 squad
@entity15 will go to the @entity24 ahead of the @entity29 defender
@entity5 , who has 107 caps , will retire from international football
@entity15 , 18 , is one of eight players in the squad aged under 24
