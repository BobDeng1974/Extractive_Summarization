@entity0 had one of the toughest jobs of any @entity4 manager this summer as he tried to find replacements for a @entity7 team raided of many of its best players			1
at the back he has recruited @entity12 , who he has known for a decade			1
here , @entity13 takes a look at what makes him special			0
new boy : @entity12 poses in his @entity7 shirt after sealing a season - long loan move where is he from ? originally from a district of @entity22 called @entity23			1
easy for you to say			0
another @entity26 in the @entity4 , are they staging a takeover ? perhaps			0
@entity12 , who represented his country in @entity29 this summer , is the 16th @entity26 currently playing in the top division , 13 of whom are full internationals			2
they could form an entire team , plus extras , or open a really good chocolate factory			0
so what are his vital statistics ? he is a 25 - year - old , 6ft1in centre back on a loan deal from @entity41 but there is an option to buy for £ 6.3 million			1
he can also play right - back , offering additional cover for @entity46 after he was sold to @entity47			2
solid : @entity12 ( right ) makes a clearance during the @entity51 final against @entity52 heads up : the former @entity54 man struggled for playing time at @entity56 , prompting his move to the @entity4 and can he fill a @entity59 sized hole ? very possibly			1
he is a solid and experienced defender with 37 international caps			2
he can also score , his header against @entity62 last season kept @entity41 in the hunt for the title			0
why did he want to leave the sunshine of @entity41 ? he was n’t being played as much as he wanted in @entity67 , having moved from @entity54 on a four - year deal in 2013			0
@entity12 had been a key part of the @entity54 team , but played just 12 matches as @entity41 won the @entity73 title and got fed up of warming the bench			1
did he want to be beside the seaside , too ? looks that way			0
@entity12 did a tour of the @entity78 – granted not one that is overly prominent in the holiday brouchures – visiting @entity81 and @entity7 with both clubs interested as well as @entity83			1
but he passed on the @entity84 and the @entity85 and opted for the south coast instead			0
experienced : @entity12 , pictured here in action against @entity89 at the @entity90 , is a @entity91 international fans ' favourite : some supporters in @entity96 have created @entity98 videos in honour of @entity12 's hair quite right , too			1
so why did he choose @entity7 ? well , he knows new boss @entity0 from their time at @entity54 together			0
in august 2004 , @entity12 joined the youth academy managed by @entity0 , who had spent three years playing for the club before taking charge of its first team in 2001			1
what ’s his hair all about ? forget the @entity112 ponytail it ’s all about the @entity12 slick back , famous in its own right			2
there are even extensive @entity98 tutorials made in @entity96 , by those with only a passing interest in ‘ soccer ’ but want their hair just like @entity12 .			0

@entity7 *signed* @entity12 on loan on *transfer* *deadline* day
the defender has left @entity73 side @entity41 on a *temporary* basis
the @entity91 international can play as a centre back and a right back
he will aim to replace @entity59 , who departed for @entity133 in august
