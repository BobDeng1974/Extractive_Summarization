a @entity1 fighter jet pilot was in hot water today over a supersonic flight over a @entity5 seaside town at 800mph			2
the flight caused a huge sonic boom blast , which smashed windows in @entity9 , terrified locals , and caused the ground to shake			1
@entity1 @entity13 chiefs have apologised for the accidental boom , which is a breach of aviation rules , caused by one of its @entity18 jet fighters going too fast during a training exercise			1
boom : a @entity1 @entity13 pilot was in hot water today over a supersonic flight in an @entity18 jet fighter , similar to the one pictured , over a @entity9 at 800mph the jet flew more than 200 miles across @entity27 from @entity28 to the @entity5 coast - but it broke the 761mph speed of sound over @entity9			1
the sonic boom was so severe it caused two classroom windows to smash in @entity33 , and caused ceiling tiles to come crashing down in a @entity36 supermarket			1
housewife @entity37 , 58 , was in the meat aisle when she heard what she thought was an explosion			0
' i always do my weekly shop on a monday because it is much quieter and there are n't so many people about , ' she said			0
' i was picking up a joint of beef when i heard a huge explosion and the ceiling tiles came down - i thought the world was coming to an end			0
mission : the aircraft had flown from @entity53 to the @entity5 coast for an air - to - air training mission ' the noise just came out of nowhere and made me drop my beef ! ' we thought a plane had crashed into the roof it was so loud - it was just shocking			1
' people in the coastal town took to @entity62 to report feeling a huge tremor which smashed windows and caused roof tiles to fall on monday afternoon			2
university student @entity66 tweeted : ' @entity67 experienced my first sonic boom whilst sitting innocently in the library trying to work - only in @entity9 ! ' night - shift worker @entity70 said : ' i was just falling asleep and the sonic boom happened			1
keep it down please ! ' university student @entity66 tweeted : ' @entity67 experienced my first sonic boom whilst sitting innocently in the library trying to work - only in @entity9 ! ' shock : resident @entity75 said : ' the entire town had a heart attack at that noise ! ' @entity80 almost set her carpet on fire when the massive noise occurred while she was straightening her hair resident @entity75 said : ' the entire town had a heart attack at that noise ! ' night - shift worker @entity70 said : ' i was just falling asleep and the sonic boom happened			1
keep it down please ! ' some thought a bomb had been dropped on the town but others believed an earthquake had struck			0
the @entity18 is an all - weather multirole fighter designed in the 1980s for long - range and high speed missions			2
the jet 's top speed is around 1,650mph - more than twice the speed of sound , and double its speed over @entity9			2
built by @entity100 , formerly @entity101 , it was first flown on december 11 , 1986 , and introduced in april 1988			0
the model , which carries a crew of two people , has been deployed for operations in @entity106 , including @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 , carrying out air strikes and patrols as well as supporting troops on the ground			2
as well as the @entity13 the jet is also used by the @entity115 , the @entity116 @entity13 and the @entity117			2
the plane is controlled via a central computer , connected to an array of sensors - with the pilot giving instructions to the computer , which can also make adjustments on its own to improve flight performance			0
@entity80 almost set her carpet on fire when the massive noise occured while she was straightening her hair			0
she tweeted : ' @entity131 just made me drop my straighteners and burn the carpet			0
' a sonic boom is the sound associated with the shock waves created by an object traveling through the air faster than the speed of sound			1
the @entity13 's 48th fighter wing today apologised for the disturbance saying several of its f - 15e jets from @entity53 in @entity28 had been training near the coast			1
it said one plane inadvertently broke the sound barrier - causing the boom			1
a spokesman said : ' we can confirm that an aircraft from @entity53 is likely to have been responsible for the sonic boom reported over @entity9			1
' at that time , several @entity18 aircraft were conducting a challenging air - to - air training mission			1
' typically , this would be carried out over water but the airspace to be used was lost to us and the jets were re-routed to the @entity5 military training airspace			0
' during the course of the training exercise , near the coast and in the vicinity of @entity9 , one of the aircraft , already travelling at high speed , inadvertently and briefly went supersonic at around 18,000ft and in the process was likely to have caused the noise that was reported online			1
' we offer our sincerest apologies for any disturbance or concern that this may have caused			0
' we continue to emphasise airspeed restrictions in our pre-flight briefings to minimise the possibility of inadvertently breaching the sound barrier			0
' the sonic boom has prompted renewed calls for the @entity178 to give better warning about low flying jets in the area			2
last year , two trainee @entity183 fighter pilots in @entity186 jets narrowly avoided a disastrous 600mph mid-air collision just off the coast of @entity9			0
councillor @entity189 said : ' the @entity178 needs to start liaising with the community about these exercises and giving proper warning each time			0
' they need to explain the purpose of the exercises and why they ca n't be held out at sea			0

the @entity18 broke the speed of sound and caused a sonic boom
people in @entity204 reported the ground shaking and windows breaking
@entity1 @entity13 chiefs have apologised and said the jet was going too fast
plane from @entity53 in @entity28 was on an air - to - air training exercise
