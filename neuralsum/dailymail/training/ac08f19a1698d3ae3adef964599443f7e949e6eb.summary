a bill to end the ‘ daft and unnecessary ’ court battles over just inches of land will be considered by ministers today			1
@entity13 mp @entity12 will try to end the costly legal fights which have seen one set of warring neighbours fork out up to £ 400,000 for a 60cm wide strip of land			1
row : @entity1 could be forced to settle their boundary disputes outside the court - room ( file picture ) impartial surveyors , rather than judges , would be given the power to sort out the wrangles under the @entity26 mp ’s @entity25			1
each party would pay for their own legal costs , although the surveyor would have discretion to award costs			1
mr @entity12 said his proposal would provide a ‘ fast , cheap and effective ’ process			1
most of the disputes involve trivial amounts of land and are usually started by one neighbour encroaching on another ’s with their fence or a hedge			0
the row escalates when the vegetation is cut down or the fences are torn down			0
families can often end up in court and the costs can soar so quickly that both parties dig in to try to recover their fees - making mediation less likely			2
inches : @entity1 have often spent thousands on legal bills trying to settle disputes over tiny bits of land between homes ( file picture ) one boundary disputed in @entity58 was started by planners who used a thick pen to mark out boundaries on a small - scale plan			1
the area was just 60cm wide yet the legal costs ran to £ 400,000			1
in @entity66 , two neighbours warred over a six metre square patch of land for two years			2
the court costs ended up soaring to £ 160,000			2
one boundary dispute over a driveway turned nasty when a farmer was accused of firing a shot at his neighbour who had chased a runaway horse that had strayed on to his property			0
it turned out the shot had actually been fired from a booby trap , rather than a gun , but not before police helicopters and armed officers descended on to the property			0
mr @entity12 ’s @entity25 - which would apply to @entity84 and @entity85 - is based on the @entity86 , where any disputes are settled through surveyors rather than judges			2
mr @entity12 urged the government to ‘ stop sitting on the fence ’ and back his bill , adding : ‘ we ’ve seen cases where £ 100,000 or more is spent arguing over a two - foot strip of land			1
' this is barmy and reform is urgently needed to stamp out boundary disputes			0
' this is why i have tabled a bill that will do just that			0
i hope the government will consider the bill and allow it to go forward			0
’ it is understand that the @entity105 could allow the @entity25 to go forward			0
although it may not become law , there are hopes that ministers will use it to amend existing rules .			0
