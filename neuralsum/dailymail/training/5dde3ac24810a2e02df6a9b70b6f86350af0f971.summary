the mayhem enveloping @entity1 is continuing apace as a feud between @entity4 and former assistant manager @entity5 was reignited on tuesday			1
@entity5 left his post last week after refusing to sign a contract at @entity8 - outspoken in slamming the way in which the underfire chairman runs the club			1
the breaking of promises regarding the playing budget and dilapidated training ground were central to his discontent			0
feud : @entity5 ( right ) has criticised the way @entity1 has been run since leaving the club last week @entity4 opted to bite back a weekly column for the town ’s newspaper , poking fun at the ex-coach despite the @entity25 becoming embroiled in a farcical situation whereby manager @entity27 does n’t know whether he is to be sacked or not			1
‘ it was interesting to see the comments made by @entity30 on his exit last week , ’ @entity4 penned			1
‘ i think sometimes in football when people do n't get their own way they tend to make a disproportionate crisis of it and i think that 's what @entity5 's done			1
‘ he knew exactly what he was coming to when he came and if he did n't , more fool him			2
the fact he 's reacted the way he has after not getting his own way probably says a lot about him			0
’ @entity5 attempted to keep his cool when speaking to @entity46 and refused to become involved in a slanging match			1
fighting back : @entity4 responded to his former employee 's claims by mocking his coaching abilities ‘ i ’ve only just stopped laughing , ’ the @entity51 said			1
this is getting ridiculous now			2
disrespectful is too nice a word			0
it ’s beyond a joke			0
’ @entity5 turned down a contract offer and was n’t paid during his time on the @entity60			1
‘ @entity4 does n’t accept no for an answer , ’ he added			1
‘ he promised everything would be improved but we saw nothing in two months			0
‘ i do n’t know another chairman who reacts like that			2
you should work with your team and players , not against them			0
‘ i do n’t want to stoop to that level			2
i respect the gaffer , the players and the fans too much			0
’ @entity75 also asserted that @entity5 ’s natural coaching level was ‘ the lower leagues in @entity51 , ’ adding that the club ‘ back his sensible decision to return ’			1
poor start : on the field @entity1 are yet to pick up a single point from their five championship games that clearly irked the 47 - year - old : ‘ i ’ve trained at the highest level in @entity51			1
i have got my @entity89 licence			0
’ @entity75 is likely to sack @entity90 after @entity1 lost each of their opening six competitive fixtures this season , and had lined up @entity94 as his replacement			2
that , however , looks increasingly problematic after serious disputes arose over a five - figure fee due to the @entity100 ’s agent			0
@entity75 is renowned for not paying intermediaries			0
@entity27 took training on monday and tuesday before meeting the chairman for talks over his immediate future			0
@entity4 also took aim at the boss in his column , saying : ' i have to say i find myself slightly bemused yet again by the actions of our manager			2
' he has said , on many occasions on the record , that he would use the international break to get the players up to fitness and to work with the squad we now have			0
' the first thing the manager does is hop on a plane and clear off to @entity51 for a week without telling anyone			1
' questions : @entity75 also criticised his manager @entity27 ( above ) for going away during the international break			0

@entity5 left @entity1 last week and has *complained* about the club
@entity4 said former assistant manager was making a ' disproportionate crisis ' out of events because he had not got his own way
