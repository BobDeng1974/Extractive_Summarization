the most brutal political ad of the 2012 election has blown up in the @entity4 campaign 's face after blatant deceptions were revealed in the story of a woman who died of cancer following the closure of a steel mill owned by @entity12 's venture capital firm			1
@entity13 , who has appeared in an @entity15 ad before , links the loss of his job and health benefits at a plant in @entity20 , @entity21 , to his wife @entity22 succumbing to stage four cancer in the new commercial titled ' understands			1
' mr @entity13 says @entity12 does n't know what his private equity firm did to workers , ' and further , i do n't think he 's concerned			1
' however , it has come to light that mrs @entity31 had her own health insurance from her employer for years after her husband was laid off			1
furthermore , the plant closed in 2001 - when @entity12 was no longer involved in the daily operation of the company - and mrs @entity31 died five years later in 2006			1
@entity49 says the ad is ' not accurate			0
' the @entity51 's @entity50 gave the commercial ' four @entity52 , ' the lowest possible truth rating , calling it a ' whopper ' of a lie			0
the commercial was released on tuesday by @entity57 , the super pac supporting the president 's reelection campaign			0
the president can officially disavow the attack by saying it was produced by an independent group , but the pac is run by two former @entity65 aides and other close allies			0
point - by - point , the one minute advert 's omissions and deceptions : dispute : @entity12 's experience at @entity41 has been a source of exhaustive attacks by the @entity4 campaign in an effort to discredit the @entity76 challenger the story centers around mr @entity13 , a 62 - year - old lifelong @entity78 and union supporter , who worked at @entity80 in @entity20 for more than 20 years			1
he has come forward as a political partisan and the @entity4 campaign has tried to make him the face of the white working - class @entity83 who was a victim of @entity12 's ' vulture capitalism			2
' this is the second attack ad against @entity41 that has given mr @entity13 a starring role			1
he was first seen in a video about the closure of his steel plant that was released in may			2
however brutal mr @entity13 's claims are , the facts tell a different story			2
@entity12 did not close the steel mill mr @entity13 , though , blames the plant closure directly on the presumptive @entity76 nominee			1
' i do n't think @entity12 knows what he has done to people 's lives by closing the plant			2
i do n't think he realizes that people 's lives have completely changed , ' he says in the ad			0
in 1999 , @entity12 left @entity41 to run the 2002 @entity104			2
he was no longer at the company when @entity106 went bankrupt in 2001 in the face of mounting losses			2
he formally left @entity41 for good in 2002			0
when mrs @entity31 died in 2006 , @entity12 was governor of @entity109 and had n't been in charge of @entity41 for seven years			1
@entity41 's investment did not shut down @entity80 ' @entity12 and @entity41 made millions for themselves and then closed this steel plant , ' a dramatic headline in the ad reads			1
the real story is much more complex			0
@entity41 was one of several investors that paid $ 80million to buy the plant from @entity120 in 1993			2
at the time it was struggling			0
@entity120 lost $ 640million that year			0
the @entity123 steel industry was in the midst of massive shutdowns and struggles as they lost ground to cheaper foreign imports , the @entity121 reports			0
@entity41 folded the @entity20 plant , @entity80 , into a company called @entity106 , which made $ 1billion in revenues by 1996			1
controversy : many of the campaign volleys have centered around whether @entity41 created more jobs than it destroyed @entity80 in @entity20 closed , laying off 750 workers including mr @entity13			1
it was the only plant in @entity106 that was forced to shut down as a result of the bankruptcy reorganization , the @entity121 reports			2
mrs @entity31 did not lose her healthcare because her husband lost his job ' when @entity12 and @entity41 closed the plant , i lost my healthcare			1
and my family lost their healthcare , ' mr @entity13 states in the video			1
but that 's not true , he admits			0
at the time he lost his job , mr @entity13 was earning about $ 41,000 a year			2
mrs @entity31 also had a job working at a local thrift store that gave her health insurance , @entity49 reports			1
she kept the job , and the health benefits , until she was forced to quit in 2003 after an injury			1
mrs @entity31 died five years after the plant shut down here 's how the ad plays the timeline : mr @entity13 describes losing his health insurance as a result of the plant closure			1
' a short time after that , my wife became ill , ' he says			0
however , it was not until 2006 -- five years after the plant closed -- that this happened , mr @entity13 has admitted			2
' i do n’t know how long she was sick , and i think maybe she did n’t say anything because she knew that we could n’t afford the insurance , ' he says in the ad			0
symbol : @entity13 has become the face of the @entity178 working - class ' victim ' of @entity41 -- but his story is n't what it seems the cancer was stage four by the time she went to the hospital			1
she died 22 days later			0
nonetheless , mr @entity13 still manages to blame @entity12 for his wife 's death			1
mr @entity13 ends the ad by saying : ' i do not think @entity12 realizes what he ’s done to anyone , and furthermore i do not think @entity12 is concerned			2
' the story does n't end there for mr @entity13			0
the @entity51 reveals that his income is back to $ 46,000 a year -- the same he was making at the mill -- thanks to his pension from the company and his salary as a janitor			0
he and his high school sweetheart wed four years after mrs @entity31 died of cancer			1
@entity12 's campaign blasted the new spot as ' discredited , dishonest attacks			0
' a spokesman says @entity4 is trying to distract the @entity123 people from the sluggish economy and high unemployment rates			0
the @entity211 , which supports @entity4 's campaign , has raised $ 20.7million as of june 30 and spent more than $ 17million -- all on ads attacking @entity12			0
@entity214 , @entity12 's super pac run by two former aides , has raised $ 62million and spent $ 8.2million opposing @entity4 so far			0
it also spent nearly $ 40million bashing @entity12 's @entity76 primary challengers and $ 14million support the former @entity109 governor .			0
