by @entity0 everyone hopes to one day own their dream home but , short of winning the lottery , it an aspiration out of most peoples ' grasp			2
however , one young woman has found an ingenious of overcoming these financial obstacles - by building her perfect home in a garage			2
keen designer @entity13 shelled out just £ 15,000 designing and renovating the five garages on her parents ' land and the new home has now valued at £ 150,000			1
miss @entity13 and her partner @entity18 , both 24 , live in the transformed three bed house at the old coach @entity20 in @entity22 , @entity24 - land that is also home to @entity13 's parents @entity27 and @entity28 , her grandparents and her uncle			1
miss @entity13 spent £ 15,000 on the project but the home has now been valued at ten times that amount miss @entity13 , left , has always had a flair for design , she said she lost her deposit on several rented properties because she would decorate them			1
it is this drive to create herself the perfect home that made the project so appealing			1
friends and family all pitched in with the labouring , right , to help keeps costs down she said : ' i originally started my online business from home , which is where i still work now			1
' i was living at home to save money while working as a teaching assistant and running the business			2
i used to stare at the garages and think " they could be so much better "			0
' i 've always rented properties in the past and i could never help doing renovations on them			0
in fact i never got my deposits back because i always ended up painting rooms			0
' my parents owned the garages and said that i could do what i wanted with them			1
it took two years for the row of garages to be transformed from cluttered workshops into a picturesque three - bedroom home the garages are on land which is also home to miss @entity13 's parents and grandparents , she says this is perfect as she is quite a homely person miss @entity13 , who was living at home before launching the conversion project , said she used to stare at the garages thinking ' they could be so much better ' miss @entity13 used the image editing software @entity99 to try different designs for the outside of the house , the @entity41 theme is nothing like her original intentions miss @entity13 runs her own business from home , specialising in selling art , prints and homeware the house was featured on the television programme @entity111 with @entity112 , after @entity113 submitted a photo on @entity115 ' i 'm quite a stay at home person and i like homely things and it just seemed silly to waste money on rent when i could convert the garages			1
' i 've tried to be hands on as much as possible			0
i was always collecting pictures of design ideas that i liked , and even though i look back and think i could have done some things differently i absolutely love the result			0
' miss @entity13 's eye for design can be seen throughout the open plan house			1
a light and airy living room with hard wood floors is now where a dirty workbench once stood			0
a lot of effort went in to making the house as light and airy as possible , it 's almost unrecognisable from the dark workshops that were there before the three - bedroom home has been valued at £ 150,000 , it is on the grounds of the old coach @entity20 in @entity22 , @entity24 before converting the garages , miss @entity13 was living at home and working as a teaching assistant in order to save money since completing the house , @entity13 has added an extension to create a workshop for her craft business and one cluttered garage filled with dust is now a beautiful country style kitchen			1
the exterior of the house was not what @entity13 originally had in mind , but after playing with designs she settled on the @entity41 style			2
she said : ' i was 22 when we started the work			0
i started using @entity99 to design and play around with ideas about what the house would look like			0
' i would see some things that i thought would look great and then really they were actually a bit rubbish			0
' i roughed out the designs of what i wanted it to look like and helped with a lot of the labouring work			0
everyone mucked in to help , especially my parents			0
miss @entity13 said : ' i 'm quite a stay at home person and i like homely things and it just seemed silly to waste money on rent when i could convert the garages ' because her parents owned the garages to begin with , miss @entity185 lives in the house rent and mortgage free the country style kitchen , which takes the place of one of the entire garages , is a highlight for @entity113 looking back , miss @entity13 says she would do some things different but that she still ' loves the result ' ' it took two years , lots of hard graft and a keen eye for bargains to furnish it but now i have a perfect , mortgage - free home for me , my fabulous boyfriend and my two dogs @entity38 and @entity39			1
' @entity13 's new home has also put her in the tv spotlight when she appeared on a show presented by @entity112			1
she added : ' to top it all off , i decided to send off a little picture of my home to a " take part " post i saw from @entity112 's @entity213			1
' they said they were looking for unique homes that are " @entity218 " and little did i ever think i would be accepted			0
' since completing the house , @entity13 has added an extension to create a workshop for her craft business			2
@entity13 works from the workshop running her business , @entity224 , specialising in handmade gifts , stationery , art , prints and homeware .			2

@entity13 , 24 , spent £ 15,000 converting five garages at her parents ' @entity24 home
the home , where she lives with her boyfriend and two dogs , has now been valued at £ 150,000
the conversion project took two years and friends and family *chipped* in with the heavy *lifting* to keep down costs
it was featured in @entity112 's new tv show @entity111
