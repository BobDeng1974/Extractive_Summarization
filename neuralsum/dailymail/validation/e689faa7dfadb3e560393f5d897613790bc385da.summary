when a legendary figure like @entity2 says none of the other 1,097 matches in his career was comparable with the 1979 fa cup final between @entity7 and @entity8 , you know it was something special			1
forever known as @entity12 's ' five - minute final ' , @entity7 threw away and then regained the trophy in an incredible late sequence that saw them squander a 2 - 0 lead going into the 86th minute before winning 3 - 2 in the final moments with a goal that put @entity20 's name in @entity6 folklore			1
it created a superstar in @entity7 's man - of - the - match @entity23 and broke the career of @entity8 manager @entity25			1
@entity2 ( left ) and @entity26 pose with the @entity6 after the dramatic @entity12 final of 1979 @entity2 reacts after conceding a goal as @entity8 fought back to level the scores at 2 - 2 but @entity20 scored the winning goal for @entity7 to write his name into cup folklore victorious captain @entity26 was so drained and overcome with emotion as he climbed the famous 39 steps to finally lift the trophy , he delivered an unwitting snub to the famous royal guest of honour			1
@entity26 recalls : ' prince @entity40 was there to present the trophy			0
he said , ' congratulations ' as we shook hands but as soon as i saw the cup , i turned around to lift it up to the @entity7 fans			1
' i did n't realise he was still waiting to give me my medal			0
it was only when i turned back , i saw him with it in his hand			0
it must have looked insulting but it was n't meant like that			0
@entity56 is the polite way of putting it			0
just a couple of minutes before i 'd been out on the pitch thinking ' f * * * , we 've blown it '			0
' @entity64 , who had scored @entity8 's dramatic equaliser on a baking hot may afternoon , says the impact of the game has not diminished with time			1
' it 's 36 years on and people still ask me about it every week , ' he adds ruefully			2
' they always want to know about that final rather than the one we won against @entity74 two years earlier			1
' @entity8 and @entity7 meet again in the @entity6 on monday in a quarter - final at @entity76 but it is impossible that @entity78 and @entity79 will grip the nation like their predecessors did			1
' there has not been a final before or since with the twists and turns of that game , ' says @entity23 , who helped set up the winning goal when @entity7 were on their knees reeling from @entity64 's equaliser			1
' i played two short of 1,100 games and i have never known four minutes like that , ' adds @entity2 , a gentle giant of a goalkeeper who otherwise stayed unflappable in a 23 - year career with @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity7 and @entity99			1
@entity64 ( left ) scored @entity8 's equaliser against @entity7 in the dramatic 79 cup final @entity79 ( left ) of @entity7 and @entity78 ( right ) of @entity8 will lock horns on monday the 1979 showpiece took place eight days after @entity106 had been elected @entity108 's first female prime minister and given the prestige of the @entity6 final in those days , the two events seemed equally important at the time			1
a full house of 100,000 and a tv audience of 15 million was guaranteed			0
@entity8 travelled to their team hotel a full three days before the match to fulfil the insatiable demands of the press , photographers and television cameras , with @entity119 and @entity120 planning their entire saturday schedules around the final			2
then , as now , @entity7 and @entity8 were big clubs in transition			1
@entity7 had not won a trophy for eight years , while @entity8 were rebuilding after the glory days of @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			1
they had been relegated to the @entity129 five years earlier			0
both sets of supporters flocked down @entity132 convinced good times were about to return for their club			0
for 85 minutes , the match appeared routine , with @entity136 scoring for @entity7 after 12 minutes and @entity137 adding to it with a 43rd - minute header			1
the only talking point was over who should be credited with the opening goal — @entity136 or @entity142 , who appeared to connect at the same time			2
' i know it was mine			0
i 've got a picture on my trophy cabinet showing me kicking the ball and @entity20 kicking my boot , ' says @entity136			1
with @entity7 leading 2 - 0 going into the final minutes , complacency crept in			1
' it was unprofessional but i met eyes with @entity23 as if to say , ' yes , we 've won it ' , ' says @entity154			2
' we were coasting , comfortable , ' adds @entity136			0
even the experienced @entity2 says : ' i was imagining myself going up the steps			1
' @entity136 ( right ) opened the scoring for @entity7 after only 12 minutes in the cup final against @entity8 @entity158 ( fifth left ) pulled a goal back in the 86th minute to give @entity8 hope then , with just five minutes left , @entity7 boss @entity161 decided to send on substitute @entity162 for @entity163 as a thank - you for his performances in earlier rounds			1
out of nowhere , in the 86th minute , @entity158 drove in a loose ball from a set piece to make it 2 - 1			1
just 106 second later , @entity64 jinked past @entity169 and @entity162 before toepoking past an onrushing @entity170 to equalise			0
@entity172 ensued in the stadium as @entity7 fell apart			2
' i knew the cameras were on me so i put on my best acting , trying to look concerned but not terribly worried , ' says @entity161			0
' in reality , my insides were going up and down			0
' reflecting now , @entity64 says : ' the @entity7 boys were gone , on their knees			2
if we 'd taken it into extra-time , we would have won			2
' i went crazy , i could have run out of @entity12 and back in again after that goal			2
after the game , @entity184 [ the scout from @entity99 who discovered both @entity64 and @entity126 ] told me we 'd celebrated too long , we should have gone back to the halfway line and concentrated			2
' he was probably right but it was not what we wanted to hear after throwing it away			0
' at 2 - 2 , @entity8 were now red - hot favourites but what happened from the restart is part of @entity6 legend			1
@entity23 surged into the @entity8 half past @entity195 , then past @entity196 , and slipped a ball to @entity198 on the left			0
@entity137 in possession for @entity7 in the cup final against @entity8 at @entity12 in 1979 @entity23 ( left ) , @entity137 ( centre ) and @entity169 ( right ) were in @entity7 's winning squad @entity154 , a 21 - year - old from a south @entity206 pit village , delivered a cross that arced away from @entity8 goalkeeper @entity208 , leaving @entity142 the chance to score from close - range			1
the picture of the bouffant - haired forward running away in total ecstasy chased by the most - relieved substitute in history , @entity162 , remains an iconic image			2
' when i picked up the ball , i was initially just trying to get the ball away from our goal , ' says @entity23			0
' i went past one challenge , two challenges and i was in the final third and i saw @entity154 outside me			0
' @entity154 takes up the story			0
' i did n't know @entity142 was at the far post , my only thought was to take the cross away from the goalkeeper			0
it was something i 'd trained on with [ coach ] @entity231 all those wet and windy wednesday nights : keep it out of the keeper 's grasp			0
' @entity142 says : ' i went into auto - pilot and when the ball went it , the pent - up emotion came out			0
' just two minutes , 59 seconds had elapsed between the three goals and history had been made			0
more than 250,000 @entity7 fans greeted the team 's heroes in @entity242 the following day			1
the @entity7 players collected bonuses nearly three times their £ 1,000 - a - week wages but for some the long - term rewards turned out to be far greater			1
@entity23 's performances against @entity248 in the following season 's @entity249 - @entity250 persuaded the @entity252 giants to sign him and he blazed a trail for many other @entity255 stars like @entity256 and @entity257 to go to @entity258 for @entity8 , being a runner - up was not good enough and @entity25 was sacked within two years			2
' he was unlucky , if we 'd won the final , he would have been given more time , ' says @entity195 , a comment that will be of interest to @entity264			2
more than 250,000 supporters came out to greet @entity7 the day after their @entity6 triumph @entity7 parade the trophy around @entity12 after securing a dramatic victory over @entity8 @entity7 's class of ' 79 still meet up for reunions at the @entity272 and @entity26 will be at @entity76 tomorrow with the club 's board of directors			1
' i still remember the elation , ' says the former @entity7 captain			2
' when @entity278 scored , i thought , ' right , we 're not going to bloody lose this again '			0
' if monday 's tie produces just a quarter of the late drama of ' 79 , it will be a thriller .			0

@entity2 feels the 1979 fa cup final was the best game of his career
@entity7 won 3 - 2 but lost a two goal lead in the 86th and 88th minute
@entity20 then scored @entity7 's winner in the 89th minute
