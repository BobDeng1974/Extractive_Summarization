paranoid schizophrenic @entity0 , who killed his father after being freed because a hospital mental health ward was full , went on to stab his mother to death inside his secure unit a paranoid schizophrenic who killed his father after being freed because a hospital mental health ward was full went on to stab his mother to death inside his secure unit			1
an independent report into @entity12 's death found that both she and her taxi driver son @entity13 were ' seriously failed ' by mental health professionals at @entity15			1
after suffering paranoid hallucinations @entity16 , now 42 , was admitted to a hospital mental health unit in 2003 but there were no beds available , leaving him free to bludgeon his father @entity21 to death with a hammer in their family kitchen in @entity26 , @entity27 , just two days later			1
he was given a conditional discharge following his father 's death , but while he was living at the secure @entity32 mental health centre in @entity33 in 2010 he stabbed mrs @entity12 , 70 , in the throat before going downstairs to chat to social workers about @entity36			1
the damning report - compiled by a panel of doctors and mental health experts - outlined multiple failings by the @entity42 and independent charity imagine , who ran the facility in @entity46			1
among the failings listed in the report were that mrs @entity12 was found dead inside his flat - which was supposed to be a ' 24 - hour mental health facility ' , and that she had been placed in ' unmitigated risk ' @entity12 was first diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2003 , and admitted to hospital shortly afterwards			1
however , officials were unable to find a bed for him until two days later			2
when a carer called to organise picking him up to take him to hospital , a police officer answered and said he had killed his father by bludgeoning him with a hammer in the kitchen of the family home			1
he received a conditional discharge two years after the killing of his father , but the report found that mental health workers ' did not recognise the level of risk he posed to himself and others ' , and told him to move to a more independent flat in 2010			1
just days later , his mother came to visit the flat , where she was was brutally stabbed			1
@entity12 later returned to the family home to set it alight			0
following his release on conditional discharge , @entity12 was meant to be monitored 24 hours a day and contact with his mother was supposed to be carefully supervised			1
however , the report found that ‘ unacceptable ’ planning failures ' in effect left mr @entity0 to regulate his own activities and set his own boundaries			1
' the report said this damning ' failing of duty of care ' left the seriously ill man with no safety net strong enough to ensure his safety , or the safety of his mother			1
while @entity12 was living at a secure @entity32 mental health centre in @entity33 in 2010 he stabbed @entity12 , 70 , in the throat before going downstairs to chat to social workers about @entity36 he had even tried to mutilate himself with a broken toothbrush while under watch , thinking that it was his testosterone that had made him aggressive			1
investigators ruled that had @entity12 been ' subject to robust supervision ' the risk of him killing his mother would have been ' substantially reduced '			2
they admitted that there was a serious causal link between lack of care and treatment , and the death of mrs @entity12			1
the 400 - page document also found there was no system to detect a relapse in his mental state , meaning that officials consistently reported back that he was doing well and recommended moving him to a more independent flat			2
the @entity12 family were even forced to make their own arrangements to protect mrs @entity12 after officials failed to manage his release - making ' no effort ' to educate or support them			2
the damning report into failings by the @entity42 and independent charity imagine , who ran the @entity32 facility in @entity46 found that : @entity12 was said to have a ' loving relationship with both his parents ' and worked for 10 years as a taxi driver in @entity27 before being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia			1
after the death of her husband , long - suffering mrs @entity12 , who was also seriously wounded , told officers she ' felt it would have been better if her son had killed her too '			2
but she continued to visit her son and tried to rebuild a relationship with him despite protests from concerned family members who told her ' she should have locked him up and throw away the key			0
' @entity12 's uncle even contacted officials to express his concern that @entity12 was on bail and might try and approach his mother , but social workers had said he was ‘ happy and relaxed ’			2
meanwhile , @entity12 had made a secret trip to the house of an ex-girlfriend , appearing at her door wearing just a pair of tights over his underwear and offering her a cheque for £ 7,800 , which the report said was a classic sign of relapse for his condition			2
he had failed to take his anti-psychotic medication properly for years , and had never been offered @entity160 ( @entity160 ) - a key road to recovery for thousands of mental health patients			1
just five months after brutally killing his father after an argument over money , his risk of aggression and violence was deemed ‘ low ’ by carers , despite him suffering ' paranoid ideas about his neighbours and members of his family			2
' @entity12 also thought people could read his thoughts and were monitoring his movements on a daily basis leaving him wary of authority and scared of being sectioned			0
following his discharge to the @entity32 in late 2006 , a social worker noted that he ' still presents a risk in keeping things to himself and letting them build up until it ’s too late			1
' the report concluded that it was hoped it would hightlight failings from the tragic case and put measures in place to stop any future incidents after @entity12 and his family were left with ' no support ' to help develop strategies to cope with his illness , leaving him ' vulnerable to relapse '			0
@entity15 has vowed to improve care for mentally ill patients after the ' devastating report '			0
the investigation recommended that the @entity32 should have a system where workers are aware if patients have guests , and that the staff flat should be moved to the ground floor			2
at the time of mrs @entity12 ’s death , her son ’s flat was on the ground floor , with staff upstairs			0
the report also recommend that injured family members of mentally ill people be provided with a ‘ support package ’ , as well as improved communication throughout			0
' it ’s a devastating report , it ’s devastating for the @entity12 family and it ’s devastating for me as a nurse , ' said @entity226 , executive director of nursing and @entity228			0
' what ’s important in these situations is to find out how you can learn from those mistakes and ensure those things do n’t happen again			0
' we were aware of some of the findings coming out of the independent report , which means we were able to implement some changes some time ago and we ’re actioning on a number of fronts and have been able to progress in a number of things , like better team - working and better risk - assessment			1
' it ’s been a very difficult lesson for us to learn , but it ’s provided us with an opportunity to help us going forward			0
' it really is a matter of a number of things that come together at the same time , it was a cumulative effect of a number of failings			0
' not to minimise those failings , they were important things , but actually it was all together that those problems resulted in the death			0
' it ’s been over five years , and the director of patient safety has remained in contact with the family			0
they ’ve conducted themselves in a very respectful manner , and the family have been very dignified throughout the process and they want to make sure this kind of thing does n’t happen again - and we support them in that			0
' this has been devastating for me personally as a nurse , and devastating for me personally			0
this kind of thing stays with you for a career			0
' it changes the way you practice , and what ’s important is that you learn those lessons - and the people involved in this have learnt those lessons very sharply			0
' the @entity42 also hopes to improve its risk assessment programme when patients are moved within facilities , after @entity12 was recommended for a move - despite telling carers on at least two occasions that he felt uncomfortable doing so .			0
