the last time i saw this sort of media hullabaloo in honour of a new baby , i was standing outside the @entity6 of @entity7 , @entity8			1
today , we are actually here to glimpse four new arrivals — three little boys and a girl			2
but they are all related , since they all share the same father			1
and as far as the world of racing is concerned , they have a pedigree every bit as regal as young @entity20			2
for this lot represent the first crop of progeny from arguably the greatest racehorse in history — @entity25 , the stallion who never lost a race			1
and they 're off : the first @entity25 foal to be sold , this colt by @entity32 , changed hands for £ 1.15million at a sale at @entity35 in june			1
it was bought by @entity38 's @entity37 and this week , the racing industry has been enjoying a good gawp as four of his ‘ @entity42 ’ have been the star attractions at the @entity46 stables of @entity47 , the famous equestrian auctioneers			1
it is now two years since the @entity51 - born bay superhorse thundered across the finish at @entity53 to claim a record - breaking 14th victory ( out of 14 races ) in front of his terminally - ill trainer , the late sir @entity57			1
it was as emotional a day as most racing veterans can remember			2
since then , @entity25 has settled in to a new life at @entity62 stud farm outside @entity46 , where breeders and their mares are queuing up for his procreational services at £ 125,000 - a - time			1
and now the first results have been on display			2
newly - weaned and accompanied by a personal groom and 24 - hour security , these foals are on their first trip away from mother and home			1
it ’s already a test of character			2
even to an untrained eye like mine , there is something rather majestic about the lively and surprisingly furry son - of - @entity25 being led around in circles in front of a couple of propsective buyers			1
i hardly know my fetlock from my withers , but even i can still discern that this particular creature has a certain confidence and poise — almost haughtiness — which many of the gawky young things on sale here do not possess			1
girl power : the as yet unnamed chestnut filly from @entity98 in @entity38 is pictured in @entity46 no doubt this vivacious creature is a ghastly show - off in the thoroughbred playground — ‘ my @entity103 ’s won more races than all your mums and dads , so ner - ner - nee - ner - ner			1
’ — but that is precisely the sort of quality owners are looking for			0
@entity47 draws a big crowd every year for its foal sale , when over 1,000 untested thoroughbred infants change hands for astonishing sums of money			1
as @entity119 director @entity118 explains , the average price paid for a foal at last year ’s four - day sale was just under £ 45,000			1
today , the chief talking point in the bars and stable blocks has been @entity25 ’s offspring			1
will they turn out to be a chip off the old block — or just genetic hype ? since his first foal was born in january , he has sired more than 100 colts and fillies			0
most of these will remain under lock and key until they make their debut on a racecourse in 2016 ( horses can not race until they are two )			1
but there are always a few breeders who want to see a return on their investment sooner rather than later			1
so they want to sell now			0
it might be a wise move			0
these creatures carry no guarantee of racing prowess			0
one of the greatest racehorses of the last century , brigadier gerard , spent years on stud duty and sired one disappointment after another			1
winning team : @entity57 with @entity25 at @entity53 after winning the queen anne stakes royal in 2012 nature has a similar policy with the human race			1
@entity160 might have been the greatest international footballer of his age			1
but the @entity165 maestro ’s son , @entity163 , had an undistinguished career in domestic football before things really went downhill			0
six months ago , he received a 33 - year prison sentence for laundering drug money			1
so , until the first crop of @entity25 ’s offspring have run a few races , his talent as a stud remains unproven			1
but many people have still come to @entity47 trying to look for tell - tale signs in the four foals which are here			2
the first one i see is a perky chestnut filly being led around under the watchful eye of @entity183 , farm manager for @entity184 in @entity38			0
the farm has two of @entity25 ’s offspring up for sale here , this filly and a bay colt			1
neither has a name because you do n’t name a horse until it enters training			0
a potential buyer in a flat cap appears and whispers that he ’d like to have a peek at the colt			0
the stable door opens and out comes a feisty bay ( dark brown ) specimen , a dead ringer for @entity103			0
the would - be buyer nods enigmatically and leaves			2
these auctions are a very congenial affair — @entity46 ’s hotels and bars have been full for days — but the jargon , like the thumping great catalogue , is impenetrable			1
to compound the confusion , every transaction is conducted in guineas			0
@entity46 folk still regard the pound as a rather vulgar denomination			1
do n’t get them started on the euro			0
mishap : the @entity222 colt had to leave the sale @entity183 has lost count of the number of people asking to see his ‘ @entity227 ’			2
‘ i think the colt alone has done 90 shows today , ’ he says			0
surely , i suggest , a lot of people are just time - wasters ? ‘ maybe , ’ he says with a smile			1
‘ but you never know who they are or who they might be buying for			0
’ you can make no assumptions about anyone here			0
it ’s raining , it ’s muddy and most people are in wet - weather gear			2
a lady in a green anorak and old boots turns out to be @entity249 , expert breeder , scion of the @entity253 family , and one of the wealthiest women in the world			0
seeking out another @entity258 , i meet top agent , @entity259 of @entity260			0
it ’s like going wine - tasting with a claret guru			2
‘ fantastic mover , ’ mutters @entity259 as @entity264 — a bay @entity25 colt by the @entity268 dam , @entity269 — is led out of his box for our perusal			1
‘ that ’s a horse that covers plenty of ground			0
’ this particular colt is being sold ( or , in racing jargon , ‘ consigned ’ ) by the @entity285			0
‘ he ’s a stand - out horse with a great presence , ’ says manager , @entity286 , himself from illustrious racing stock			2
his elder brother , @entity290 , is the @entity291 and it was their ancestor who lent his name to the most famous race in the world			0
in another yard , i find the fourth @entity300 , a chestnut colt out of the @entity51 dam , @entity302 , herself a winner of six races and £ 436,000			2
‘ he ’s got a good attitude , ’ explains @entity306 , managing director of @entity307 , ‘ and he ’s got a long ear			0
i do like a long ear			0
’ stud hand @entity313 , whose job is to look after this colt day and night , adds : ‘ he ’s the boss in his paddock			0
’ what ’s it like nannying such a valuable bit of horseflesh ? ‘ quite nerve - racking , ’ @entity313 admits			2
it ’s always a tricky business with hyperactive toddlers like this			0
and so it proves soon afterwards when this colt bangs a leg on the side of his box			0
it ’s not serious or even unusual , but he still has to be withdrawn from the sale			2
the market is still all over the place when it comes to valuing these creatures			0
this summer , the first @entity25 foal to go on sale , a colt owned by a branch of the @entity345 royal family , fetched a cool £ 1.15 million			1
‘ i ’d rather we had n’t sold him but we have another 11 @entity25 foals at home , ’ says their racing adviser , @entity346 of @entity348			1
‘ and there are two of those that i would n’t swap for any other horse alive			0
’ @entity25 ridden by @entity357 after winning the @entity358 during @entity359 at @entity53 only last week , another @entity25 foal , a filly , broke the @entity38 record when she was sold at auction for £ 1.4 million			1
yet , two others were withdrawn from the same sale when they failed to reach their reserve prices			2
in their case , the market simply was n’t convinced that the price was right			0
last night , the remaining @entity47 three finally came under the hammer , but all failed to reach their reserve prices ( which were not disclosed )			0
the highest bid was £ 367,500 for @entity286 ’s ‘ stand - out ’ colt			1
despite the anti-climax , the general view is that most of these foals will return to the auction ring in 2015 as yearlings ( which tend to attract higher prices anyway )			0
as for future foals , prices will soar if this first crop does well in competition — as will @entity25 ’s own worth			1
and he ’s already valued at more than £ 100 million			2
but here in @entity46 , i ca n’t help feeling a little sorry for the @entity25 brood			1
they may be more pampered than the only child of an oligarch , but the attention is remorseless , the pressure is already on and they are only eight months old			0
there will , surely , come a moment when they look out across their manicured paddock and think : ‘ i wish was a @entity399 pony			0

four horses will be auctioned at @entity402 in @entity46 this week
their father @entity25 has been *dubbed* the greatest racehorse ever
breeders *pay* £ 125,000 - a - time for @entity25 's procreational services
and one of his offspring changed hands for £ 1.15million at sale in june
