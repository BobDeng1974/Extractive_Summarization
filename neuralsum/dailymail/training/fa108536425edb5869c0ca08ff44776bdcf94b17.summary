by @entity0 published : 11:21 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:44 est , 10 february 2014 a man who built @entity5 ’s biggest private aquarium in his basement may be forced to get rid of his pets after he received a £ 11,000 energy bill			1
@entity9 , 39 , created the underwater world in the basement of his five - bedroom home in @entity13 , @entity14 , filling it with tropical species from the @entity16 and @entity17			1
but the installation in his red - brick @entity20 property , which measures 12ft 6in by 12ft 8in by 7ft , needs plenty of power to keep the 4,800 gallons of water at the right temperature for the creatures			0
@entity9 , 39 , at his home in @entity13 , @entity14 where he has installed a 4,800 - gallon fish tank			1
but the aquarium , thought to be @entity5 's largest , is now in jeopardy following a row over an energy bill mr @entity9 , whose tank is filled with species from @entity17 and the @entity16 , was issued with an £ 11,000 bill by @entity36 following a meter reading it previously cost the salsa teacher £ 6,000 - a - year in heating and filtering cost			1
but he ’s just been hit with a huge arrears bill from @entity36 after an error with his meter readings			2
initially , the company demanded he pay £ 11,000 - which has since been decreased to £ 4,500			2
mr @entity9 is currently appealing against paying the bill - while @entity36 are threatening him with disconnection if he does n’t			1
the man says he will have to get rid of the tropical species because he can no longer afford the electricity - and instead replace them with freshwater fish			2
mr @entity9 , who built the 4,800 - gallon tank 10 years ago , said : ' it ’s a tremendous blow , it has really cut me up			1
mr @entity9 sits in the tank - which he accesses through the bay window on the floor above			1
@entity36 have since decreased his bill to £ 4,500 - but the salsa teacher says he may still be forced to get rid of the fish mr @entity9 cleans the tank			1
he says is furious at the energy company who claims have behaved ' atrociously ' ' i have gone to great lengths to provide a suitable spacious home for these creatures and now i ’ve got to get rid			2
' i ’m really angry , because the way they have behaved has been atrocious			0
' they should have recognised they have made a mistake and been apologetic for that and not be trying to charge me this enormous bill			0
' his collection of fish includes some valuable species like two chainsaw doradids , three 2ft long @entity82 , some @entity83 , a red tail hybrid catfish , two alligator gars , eight enormous stingrays and two @entity88 turtles			0
the aquarium is so large that mr @entity9 has to dive in every fortnight to clean it			2
the only way in is through the the bay window in the living room above			0

@entity36 claim the man has n't paid his bills in months and say they have made every effort to offer different payment plans mr @entity9 , who has been fascinated by fish since a trip to a @entity105 aquarium when he was ten said : ‘ my hobby ’s not only taken over my life , it ’s taken over my home			1
but i love it ! ’ mr @entity9 and his former girlfriend bought their @entity14 home with the intention of turning the cellar into one massive fish tank			1
three of the tank 's edges are foundation walls of the house			0
a large section of floor was removed by the bay window to allow access			0
downstairs , a wall of glass has replaced the brick wall , and behind it are some of the largest fish kept in captivity			0
the tank cost £ 5,000 to install - including £ 700 for glass and £ 800 for fibreglass lining			0
mr @entity9 said : ' when it ’s full there ’s around 4,800 gallons in the tank and i ’m on a meter			1
mr @entity138 in diving gear with one of the fish			0
the tank cost £ 5,000 to install ' each water change sees up to 1,200 gallons being taken out and then replaced and even with my high pressure hose , it takes six hours to re-fill			0
’ ‘ when i bought the house i knew exactly what i wanted to do in the cellar and the work really did n’t take that long			0
' in his previous home , he built an indoor tropical pond which he filled with 12 stingrays			0
last night @entity36 said mr @entity9 had not paid anything for months , despite their attempts to resolve the issue and the offer of different payment plans			1
the company also claimed it had reduced the bill from £ 11,000 to £ 4,500 and sent him accurate readings .			2
