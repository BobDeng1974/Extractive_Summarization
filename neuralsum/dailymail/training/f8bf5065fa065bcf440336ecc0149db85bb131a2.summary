@entity0 lasted just nine minutes of the @entity2 final before his hamstring injury forced him off			0
the @entity5 striker was risked by manager @entity6 gainst city rivals real despite tearing his hamstring in the win over @entity10			1
but to nobody 's great surprise , @entity0 did not even make it to the 10 - minute mark in @entity15 , being replaced by @entity16			2
off night : @entity0 ( right ) leaves the field with a hamstring injury after nine minutes @entity19 backfired : starting @entity0 was a risk for @entity5 and the striker blatantly was not fit the centre forward must now be a doubt for @entity26 's @entity25 squad and @entity27 names his party on sunday			1
@entity0 had been to @entity29 to see doctor @entity30 , who uses fluid derived from horse placenta to repair damaged cells			0
and he trained with @entity5 last week , which presumably convinced @entity6 that he was ready for action			0
however , he blatantly was not and after a handful of laboured runs , he made his exit			0
decision : @entity26 boss @entity27 selects his @entity26 squad on sunday - @entity0 must be a doubt			1

@entity5 striker *limps* off after just nine minutes against @entity43
his fitness had been in doubt but @entity6 decided to risk him
@entity27 naming @entity26 's @entity25 squad on sunday
@entity0 is now a huge question mark to make the *23*
