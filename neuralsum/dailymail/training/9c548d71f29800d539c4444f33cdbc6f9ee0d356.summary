it 's the ultimate sweetheart deal for a free - spending federal government : wednesday night 's debt deal did n't actually raise the limit on @entity5 's credit card , but instead removed it entirely until february 7 , 2014			1
whether through legislative sleight - of - hand or something less sinister , the law of the land now permits the @entity5 to run up new debts for 16 weeks without consequences , and forbids the @entity12 from enforcing the debt limit that ordinarily keeps spending from spiraling out of control			1
some observers noted on wednesday that when @entity17 burned the midnight oil to debate a deal that would save the @entity5 from crashing through its existing $ 16.7 trillion debt ceiling and risking a credit default , there was no debate over exactly how far to raise it			2
@entity25 and @entity26 negotiators only discussed how long the agreement would last			0
look familiar ? shoppers on food stamps cleaned out a @entity31 @entity30 after a computer glitch removed spending limits on their @entity35 cards for a few hours on saturday			0
@entity17 now holds the license for a similar spending spree pushing the limit : the @entity39 already registered $ 16.9 trillion on tuesday , with no end in sight the result has left the @entity12 free to accumulate as much debt as it needs to until the deal expires , @entity42 noted on thursday			2
the @entity46 estimated that if the government had extended its debt ceiling in this fashion through the end of 2014 , as one @entity54 proposal suggested , the federal government 's debt would have ballooned by $ 1.1 trillion			0
at that rate , the national debt will likely grow by at least $ 282.5 billion on its own by the time feb. 7 rolls around , bringing the total close to an even $ 17 trillion			1
but there 's no guarantee it wo n't grow even faster , especially if the legislative initiatives president @entity62 outlined thursday morning were to cross the finish line by year 's end , as he demanded in his first public remarks since signing the debt - limit hike law shortly after midnight			1
@entity62 said he wants @entity17 to give him a new budget deal , a 5 - year farm bill and a comprehensive reform of @entity5 's immigration laws , all before @entity72			1
any one of those three could be a colossal budget - buster			0
under ordinary circumstances , a hard - and - fast debt limit might serve as a check against runaway spending ; but with no ceiling , @entity80 could raid the @entity12 to give the president what he wants , without fear of practical roadblocks getting in the way			2
president @entity62 outlined his fall agenda on thursday , demanding a new budget , a comprehensive immigration reform law and farm legislation , any of which could break the bank now that there 's no limit on the nation 's credit card republicans , too , could take advantage of the spending loophole			1
senate minority leader @entity102 demonstrated on wednesday that he 's willing to accept expensive pot - sweeteners in exchange for a tidy solution to a messy problem			0
when @entity62 signed the debt - bailout package into law , it included more than $ 2 billion in new spending for a dam project in @entity113 's home state of @entity114 , answering for some the thorny question of why the @entity26 's top @entity54 would be so eager to make @entity80 look good by negotiating a deal when tea party conservatives in the @entity25 were refusing to do so			1
according to the conservative @entity118 , @entity62 and @entity17 have already used the trick of ' suspending ' the debt ceiling for a fixed period of time once before – running from february to may of this year			2
that deal added $ 300 billion to the national debt in 102 days			1
the deal that went into effect thursday covers 114 days			0
the only requirement for that earlier agreement was that the @entity127 - led @entity26 produce a formal budget for the first time since president @entity62 took office , which it did			2
' no savings were accomplished , ' says @entity118			0
' suspending the debt is less transparent to the @entity5 people , ' the group explains , adding that ' a calendar date is not nearly as scary to constituents as a figure in the trillions of dollars			0
' conservatives have demanded leak - proof border security as a condition to discussing amnesty for 11 million immigrants living in the @entity5 illegally , an expensive proposition that could suddenly seem affordable thousands of miles of new border fences , plus the manpower to guard them , would add tens of billions -- or more -- to the debt total while there 's no spending ceiling overhead the coming battles over a year - long federal budget , including @entity80 ' demands for new taxes and an expected @entity54 push for spending cuts , could actually reduce deficit spending ; but with no credit limit holding them back , lawmakers could see a perfect storm for committing to hundreds of billions in new earmarked projects calculated to please constituents back home			1
the farm bill , too , is likely to rack up record spending on programs like food stamps , which fall under the @entity171 's budget : the @entity62 administration has already doubled the number of @entity5 receiving these entitlements since january 2009			1
but immigration could require the biggest blank check of all			0
while @entity62 and congressional liberals want to put 11 million illegal aliens on a path to citizenship , conservatives have consistently argued that the nation 's borders must first be secured			0
that , @entity80 have countered , is simply too expensive to contemplate since it would likely involve building thousands of miles of new high - tech fences and staffing the @entity189 border with thousands of guards whose salaries no one has contemplated yet			2
@entity194 sources tell @entity195 that without a fixed debt ceiling over their heads , everyone in @entity17 might suddenly find it workable to give both parties what they want			0
food stamp recipients receive benefits from states , but the federal government pays the bills under the authority of the @entity5 @entity171 , an agency whose five - year spending plan is due for a budget - busting renewal ' i ca n't speak for the whole @entity54 caucus , of course , ' said a policy staffer to a conservative @entity54 @entity25 member , ' but some of us want a border fence badly enough that we 'll look the other way if it adds a few hundred billion to the national debt			1
' ' and once that 's in place , the biggest impediment to a citizenship path disappears			0
' since president @entity62 took office , new deficit spending has added about $ 43,000 to the national debt for every household in @entity5			1
that reflects a 60 per cent increase in the debt from where it sat on his first @entity233 , at $ 10.3 trillion			0
at current rates of growth , @entity62 will leave office with national debts twice the size of those accumulated by all the previous @entity5 presidents combined .			2

congressional deal set a time limit for a debt - ceiling *extension* , but did n't cap it with a fixed dollar amount
@entity62 's three autumn demands – a new budget , a farm bill and comprehensive immigration reform – could take the @entity5 into *uncharted* debt *territory* while @entity12 stops enforcing a limit
@entity80 ' immigration demands , previously parried with complaints about the cost of new border fences , could suddenly seem easy to grant
food stamp recipients , paid through the farm bill , have doubled under @entity62 and that growth shows no sign of stopping
@entity5 national debt stands to add a minimum of $ 300 billion between now and feb. 7 , when the *eleventh* - hour deal negotiated wednesday expires
