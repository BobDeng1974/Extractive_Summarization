by @entity0 human batteries may have seemed a little far - fetched when the @entity3 film was released in 1999 , but 15 years on , researchers could be about to make it a reality			2
professor @entity7 from @entity8 has built a generator capable of charging a mobile phone using electrons produced by our bodies			2
the device , called a single - friction - surface triboelectric generator ( @entity16 ) , produces a charge when a finger or palm taps a layer of conductive material attached to a device			1
researchers from @entity24 fitted a phone with a layer of materials that generates an electric charge when rubbed together			1
tapping the phone caused electrons to move from the skin to the phone and repeated tapping caused this charge to move into a generator , diagram pictured the single - friction - surface triboelectric generator ( @entity16 ) , generates a charge when a finger or palm taps a layer of conductive material attached to a mobile device			1
it uses what ’s known as the triboelectric effect , also known as triboelectric charging			0
when certain materials are rubbed together , the friction causes a build - up of electric charge between the two objects			1
static electricity is an example of triboelectric charging and the strength of the charge differs depending on the materials being used			0

static electricity is an example of triboelectric charging , and the strength of the charge differs depending on the materials being used			0
the @entity24 - based researchers previously created a generator capable of harnessing this triboelectric charge using a grounded electrode , but recently replaced it with a ‘ body contact ’ version			1
during recent tests , published in the @entity71 , professor @entity7 and his team fitted a mobile phone with a transparent layer of @entity16 composite material			1
in 1999 film @entity3 , human bodies were wired up to machines and used as batteries , still pictured			0
last year , @entity79 demonstrated a thermoelectric conversion material that turns changes in body temperature into an electrical charge the body contact electrode was then fitted to the side of the device , and the user ’s finger or palm			0
as a user tapped the @entity16 material layer , electrons were moved between the skin and the phone			1
repeated tapping caused this charge to move between the charged skin and the electrode , which in turn harnessed the energy			1
this energy could then be used to charge the phone , or other low - power devices			2
researchers also discovered that the body contact electrode performed better , and harnessed more energy , than the previous grounded electrode			0
the generator uses triboelectric charging			0
when certain materials are rubbed together , the friction causes a build - up of charge			2
the researchers previously created a generator capable of harnessing this charge using a grounded electrode , but recently replaced this electrode with a ' body contact electrode ' , diagram pictured the team is now working on developing the @entity16 to act as a back - up power source for wearable devices , for example , as well as medical sensors			1
future models could one day be used to power larger appliances and even buildings			2
in 1999 film @entity3 , human bodies were wired up to machines and used as batteries			0
in february last year , @entity79 demonstrated a thermoelectric conversion material that turns changes in body temperature into an electrical charge			0
the material , developed in collaboration with @entity138 ’s @entity137 ( @entity137 ) , was able to turn a temperature difference of just one degree on a human hand into ‘ several milliwatts ’ of electricity .			0

the device is called a single - friction - surface triboelectric generator ( @entity16 )
it uses materials that create an electric charge when rubbed together
researchers from @entity24 fitted a phone with a layer of composite materials
tapping the phone caused electrons to move from the skin to the phone
repeated tapping caused this charge to move into the generator , which in turn could be used to charge a phone
*engineers* are working on improving the generator to power larger devices
