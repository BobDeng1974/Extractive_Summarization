@entity0 , 14 , a teenager has been banned from the classroom for having the same haircut as his father after teachers ruled it too ' extreme '			1
@entity0 , 14 , has been studying in school isolation for the last two weeks after getting a standard short back and sides cut but has been told he will have to stay there until it grows out			1
his father , @entity4 , who has the same popular hairstyle , is concerned the @entity19 pupil is missing out on vital lessons after spending so much time away from the classroom environment			1
mr @entity0 , 44 , who lives in @entity23 , @entity24 , with wife @entity25 , 39 , son @entity26 and younger daughter @entity27 , said : ' this is absolute madness			1
' the @entity30 subcontractor , who installs disability hoists , added : ' i have to be smart for my job , as i represent my company and the health service and go into homes of the elderly and vulnerable			2
' i would n't have a hair style that was n't smart , and i would n't let my son either			1
' ' i ca n't believe how long they 're keeping him out of the classroom			0
' he 's a good boy and got lots of friends , but he even has to eat lunch on his own because the school reckon his haircut is " dangerous "			1
' @entity49 , the deputy head of @entity50 , where @entity26 attends , is standing by the school 's tough stance on so - called ' extreme ' hairstyles			1
he said : ' we continue to have consistent and clear expectations of all students in terms of uniform and personal presentation in school			1
' our expectations have been consistent for a number of years now and as a result of working closely with students and their parents - by confirming expectations and any specific changes in advance through letters , emails , on our website and through student planners and assemblies			0
' the vast majority of students present themselves exceptionally well each and every day			0
' but mr @entity0 has reprimanded the school and said the haircut is ' not extreme by any means '			1
' it 's slightly longer on top and swept to one side like all the lads have , ' he said			0
' there 's no colours , it 's not like he 's been running around with a @entity85			0
' he 's absolutely devastated			0
he 's always been good at school			2
i think he 's getting to the point where he feels victimised			0
' i said to the school " you 're pushing him to a point he 's going to turn around and rebel " , but they could n't care less			2
the deputy head teacher at @entity50 ( pictured ) has said they will stick by their tough uniform and personal presentation policy ' if we shave his head then it will be swapping one style for another and they 'll still keep him in isolation			1
' i would never let my son have an extreme hair style - i was with him when he got it cut and did n't see anything wrong with it			2
and i still do n't			0
' this year @entity26 will choose the subjects he wants to study for his gcses and will have to sit exams to decide which study groups he will be placed in for @entity111			0
mr @entity0 is worried that the disruption to his son 's education could have an adverse effect on his exam results			1
he added : ' this is the year they are taking their options which has made me even more frustrated			0
' @entity26 is growing up and wants to take pride in his appearance			0
i 'm proud of him			0
but the school just want robots , everyone to be exactly the same and to conform			2

@entity0 , 14 , has been put in school isolation for two weeks for style
he was told he will remain there until it grows out , which could take weeks
@entity134 , @entity4 , is concerned he is missing out on vital education
but school said it will stand by its tough policy on personal presentation
