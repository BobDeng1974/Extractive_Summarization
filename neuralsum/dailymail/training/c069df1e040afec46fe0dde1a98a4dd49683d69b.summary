the @entity25 student first suffered a life - threatening anaphylactic shock from the allergy while on a run in her hometown in 2013			1
battle : @entity6 , left and right in her soccer uniform , has learned that she suffers from an extreme hives disorder when her skin is exposed to heat and sweat that can send her to the er ' i had a really upset stomach , tingly palms and the bottoms of my feet , ' she recounted to @entity41			1

it hit me like uncomfortable heat waves			0
then i could feel the swelling in my throat , and my tongue got tingly and thicker			0
' she called her mother , who arrived with an ambulance as her throat was closing			0
she underwent treatment but by the time she returned to school that fall , she had suffered a staggering 17 shocks - always when she was training			0
support : @entity6 ( number 30 ) is now able to manage her symptoms thanks to an asthma medicine the avid soccer player tried numerous different strategies to reduce her body 's response to sweat , including wearing a cooling vest and taking ice baths before practice - but nothing worked			1
