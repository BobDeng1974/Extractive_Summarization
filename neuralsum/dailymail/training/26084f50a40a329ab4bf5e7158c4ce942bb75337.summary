it is the biggest problem smartphone owners face - smashed screens from dropping their handset			0
however , @entity5 , the firm behind the displays in phones from @entity8 , @entity9 and others , has revealed a new version of it 's ' @entity12 ' it says is twice as strong			1
@entity12 4 passed @entity5 's meter - high drop test about 80 percent of the time , and it already on its way to manufacturers , the firm said			1
to test the glass , @entity5 scientists examined hundreds of broken devices and found that damage caused by sharp contact accounted for more than 70 percent of field failures			2
the scientists then developed new drop - test machines that simulate real - world break events , based on thousands of hours analyzing cover glass that had broken in the field or laboratory			1
the scientists used the new methods to drop devices face down from one meter , ensuring the cover glass directly contacted a rough surface when it landed			1
' the new @entity38 has been formulated to address consumers ' number one issue – screen breakage from everyday drops , ' the firm says			0
' @entity44 has outperformed competing materials , such as soda - lime glass and other strengthened glass , since it was introduced in 2007 , and we 're always innovating to push the limits of what glass can do , ' said @entity52 of @entity5			2
' with @entity12 4 , we have focused on significantly improving protection against sharp contact damage , which is the primary reason that mobile devices break			1
' dropping and breaking a phone is a common problem , and one that our customers have asked us to help address			0

over 40 manufacturers have designed @entity12 into a total of 1,395 product models , and have branded @entity12 touch cover glass as a key selling feature			1
since its launch in 2007 , @entity12 has been featured in more than 3 billion devices			2
product sampling and shipment for @entity85 are under way with @entity5 's global customers , the firm said			0
it is believed that despite problems with its processing plant , @entity8 still hopes to use sapphire glass in its @entity92 and possibly in future iphones			1
synthetic sapphire is a hard , transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide , produced at high temperatures			2
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			0
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , super-strong and scratch resistant			0
@entity8 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity110 fingerprint scanner on its latest @entity111 and to protects the phone 's camera			1
as a result , sapphire glass could potentially replace @entity12 currently used in most high - end smartphones			1
@entity8 uses @entity118 strengthened glass in its handsets			2
to make ion - strengthened glass , glass is placed into a hot bath of potassium salt , typically potassium nitrate , at around 300 ° @entity125 )			0
this causes the sodium ions in the glass to migrate , which in turn causes sodium ions in the glass surface to be replaced by potassium ions from the bath solution			0
the larger potassium ions in the bath squeeze themselves into the holes created by the moving sodium			0
this compresses the glass , to accommodate the larger ions , which in turn makes it stronger			0
by comparison , sapphire screens are made from synthetic sapphire - a hard , transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide , produced at high temperatures			1
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			0

@entity12 4 passed meter - high drop test about 80 *%* of the time
had been hoped apple would add ' *scratchproof* ' sapphire glass display to @entity111 6 - but hit manufacturing *difficulties*
@entity164 expected to arrive in handsets within months
