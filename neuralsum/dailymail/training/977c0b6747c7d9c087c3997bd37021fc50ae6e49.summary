an @entity1 satellite has found an unusual consequence of the melting of ice in @entity5			1
while rising sea levels and changing global temperatures are already known to be a consequence of alleged manmade climate change , the @entity7 satellite - which was not intended to study the effects of a warming climate - has found that gravity is weakening where ice is melting the fastest			1
the results show that the thinning ice sheet from november 2009 to june 2012 caused local variations in gravity , measured by the satellite			1
in this graphic a combination of data from @entity1 's @entity7 mission and @entity23 's @entity31 satellites shows the ‘ vertical gravity gradient change ’			1
@entity34 is the biggest change , red the least the @entity7 satellite burned up in @entity26 ’s atmosphere as planned in november 2013 after four years in orbit			2
during its mission it measured @entity26 ’s gravity in unprecedented detail , detailing where it was weakest and strongest on the surface			0
but recently , the high - resolution measurements from @entity7 over @entity5 between november 2009 and june 2012 were analysed by scientists from the @entity47 , @entity48 in the @entity49 , the @entity22 in @entity24 and the @entity50 in @entity51			1
full name : gravity field and steady - state @entity54 mission length : 17 march 2009 - nov 2013 number of instruments : three mission cost : £ 295 million ( $ 480 million ) orbit : about 160 miles ( 260km ) altitude , polar , aun - synchronous mass : 2,425lbs ( 1,100kg ) size : 17.4ft ( 5.3 metres long , about 3.3ft ( one metre ) body diameter scientists found that the decrease in the mass of ice during this period was mirrored in @entity7 ’s measurements of gravity , even though the mission was not designed to detect changes over time			2
the findings were made by combining @entity7 ’s high - resolution measurements with information from the @entity23 - @entity51 grace satellite , designed to measure change in ice mass. the fluctuations observed are minute , however , and not enough for a living organism to sense			1
the measurements from @entity7 correlate with the @entity31 satellite and show how much ice is being lost each year			2
while exact figures of the shift in gravity are miniscule , the results show how some parts of the @entity90 ice sheet are losing up to 67 gigatones of ice per year			0
this is contributing to a 0.51 mm per year sea level rise in the @entity95			0
and they found that that the loss of ice from @entity5 between 2009 and 2012 caused the dip in the gravity field over the region			2
in addition , @entity7 data could be used to help validate satellite altimetry measurements for an even clearer understanding of ice - sheet and sea - level change in the future			0
the changes in gravity intensity were found to be occurring where ice is melting fastest in @entity5 due to manmade global warming			2
the discovery was made by the @entity7 satellite , which was not originally intended to study climate change the high - resolution measurements from the satellite are further evidence of how manmade climate change will affect the planet in unknown ways			1
the @entity7 satellite ( illustration shown ) burned up in @entity26 ’s atmosphere as planned in november 2013 after four years in orbit @entity1 's @entity127 satellite , which carries a radar altimeter , has recently shown that since 2009 the rate at which ice is been lost from the @entity131 every year has increased by a factor of three			1
and , between 2011 and 2014 , @entity5 as a whole has been shrinking in volume by 30 cubic miles ( 125 cubic kilometres ) a year			0
' we are now working in an interdisciplinary team to extend the analysis of @entity7 ’s data to all of @entity5 , ' said dr @entity142 from the @entity47			0
' this will help us gain further comparison with results from @entity127 for an even more reliable picture of actual changes in ice mass. ' during its mission , @entity7 produced a unique model of the geoid , which is essentially a virtual surface of @entity26 where water does not flow from one point to another			0
the colours in the image represent deviations in height from an ideal geoid			0
the blue shades represent low values and the reds / yellows represent high values			0

researchers from @entity23 's @entity22 in @entity24 and @entity1 have found that gravity is weakening at @entity26 's poles
it is occurring where ice is melting fastest in @entity5
the discovery was made by @entity1 's @entity7 satellite , which was not originally intended to study climate change
a decrease in mass over the region was found to match with *similarly* decreasing gravity measurements from november 2009 to june 2012
the high - resolution measurements from the satellite are further evidence of how manmade climate change will affect the planet in unknown ways
and the study found that the @entity90 *glaciers* lost *185* billion metric tons ( *204* billion @entity194 tons ) of ice per year over three years
