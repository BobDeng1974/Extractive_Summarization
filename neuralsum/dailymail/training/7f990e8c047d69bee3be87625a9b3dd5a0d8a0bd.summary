@entity0 : unaware of @entity2 holding the @entity3 was condemned last night after revealing it will continue investing in @entity2			1
church leaders defended the decision saying they believe their money can improve the behaviour of companies that are less than ‘ morally perfect ’			1
it came as the @entity11 announced it is considering launching a criminal investigation into the controversial payday loan firm ’s bogus legal letters sent to tens of thousands of customers			1
regulators had previously insisted that an order to pay £ 2.6million in compensation to the 45,000 recipients was sufficient punishment			2
the church ’s decision comes after a review by its @entity24 , the body which counsels church financiers on the morality of their investments			1
the report was prompted after the @entity31 last year criticised @entity2 without realising the @entity3 ’s financial arm , the @entity33 , had holdings in the firm , which are believed to amount to between £ 75,000 and £ 90,000			1
and in january , the @entity36 , the right reverend @entity37 , said that @entity2 ’s lending was sinful , adding : ‘ in the first few pages of the @entity41 , the serpent offers @entity42 an apple			1
he ’s tempted by the promise of a quick route to @entity47 - like wisdom			0
what he ’s not reckoning on is just how much it will end up costing			0
’ in the report , group chairman @entity50 said that the row had ‘ highlighted some misconceptions about ethical investment , and in particular that its objective is to achieve a morally perfect portfolio ’			1
he said : ‘ it is no more realistic to desire that they invest only in morally perfect companies than it is to desire that any of us should relate only to morally perfect individuals			1
‘ when engaging with companies the investing bodies seek positive momentum not perfection			1
we usually only recommend divestment where we see no genuine desire for change			0
’ the @entity3 controls one of the biggest and most powerful investment funds in the country			1
the @entity33 , who maintain the historic assets of the church and fund 15 per cent of everything it spends , operate on such a scale that the investment in @entity2 looks like the merest trifle			1
last year the commissioners ’ holdings grew by £ 600million to reach a record £ 6.1billion			0
their chief , the @entity84 , former journalist @entity82 , said : ‘ it was a very good year for the portfolio			0
everything that could go right did go right			0
’ but such success , as the report from the commissioner ’s @entity24 made clear yesterday , is not based on squeamish thinking about the companies into which the investment goes			2
the wealth of the fund is based on the centuries - old landholdings of the church , together with various windfalls such as @entity98 , handed over in the early 18th century to help impoverished clergymen , and which is now reckoned to be worth around a third of total assets			2
he added that occasionally ethical investors , such as the church , would ‘ graze their knees as they interact with a complex and ambiguous business world			2
but in our view , it is better to stay on the field of play than to sit on the sidelines ’			0
the investment in @entity2 , arranged through a ‘ pooled fund ’ directed by a third party , would be treated according to the parable of the weeds in the @entity121 gospel , mr @entity50 said			2
in the parable , weeds are allowed to grow with the wheat until harvest time , and only then separated from the wheat and burned			0
he went on to justify the decision to keep the investment by saying : ‘ it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick			2
’ @entity132 , the group ’s secretary , said that the furore surrounding @entity2 over the past few days had been ‘ very concerning ’ , adding : ‘ we do n’t like the business and we would rather we were n’t in it			2
’ but he said the potential loss from withdrawing was ‘ disproportionate ’			0
because of the way pooled funds operate , a platform of investments would have to be pulled			0
police could reconsider launching a criminal investigation into the payday lender @entity2 , it has been revealed as a result the commissioners are said to have calculated that they will lose between £ 3million and £ 9million if they take their money out of @entity2			1
the archbishop , the most reverend @entity0 , was on holiday and unavailable for comment yesterday			0
meanwhile the reverend @entity153 , a @entity154 vicar who is chairman of the influential evangelical group reform , criticised the church ’s decision , saying : ‘ i do not think the @entity33 have set out to do anything other than act in the best interests of the @entity3			1
‘ but once the facts are presented to them , it is up to the commissioners to do something about it			0
’ @entity167 , of pressure group @entity168 , and a member of the church ’s @entity170 , said : ‘ the job of the @entity3 is to tell the truth , and it should not be doing things that do a disservice to that task			1
’ the group ’s report also said it would introduce lower ethical investment thresholds			0
in future , it will withdraw money from firms with more than 10 per cent of their business in tobacco , gambling , high interest rate lending or human embryonic cloning , instead of the present threshold of 25 per cent .			0
