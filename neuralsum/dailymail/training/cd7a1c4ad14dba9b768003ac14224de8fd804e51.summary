by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 11:29 est , 18 july 2013 these absolutely astonishing pictures of utterly incompetent parking are made all the more amazing because they come from a single town in the @entity4			1
@entity5 may be in the running for being @entity4 's worst town for selfish , thoughtless and downright inept parking after a @entity10 page exposed the @entity14 town 's driver 's nightmarish abuse of spaces , kerbs , roads and even steep slopes			1
parking like a t * * * in @entity5 invites people in the town to submit pictures of the kind of parking that makes considerate road users slap their forehead in frustration			1
what were they thinking ? this driver has plonked his car across two spaces in a @entity5 car park			1
it is just one example from a @entity10 page shaming poor parking in the town off - road : perhaps this 4x4 owner wanted to test their vehicle 's ability to climb slopes ? it has been liked more than 7,900 times and has been deluged with pictures of cars taking up two , three and even four parking spaces in car parks , vehicles blocking roads and pavements , motors squeezed into tight spots and cars parked in disabled and parent - only bays outside supermarkets			1
the group , which has been set up anonymously , simply states : ' @entity59 up of people and their parking ? send us a pic in a message and it ’ll be posted anonymously			1
' one poster on the group said : ' i commend you on shaming these people who put the love of their car above their respect for other people			0
' it is amusing and annoying in equal measure to see what some of these berks deem to be acceptable parking			2
' did n't brake in time ? this white @entity80 has two wheels on the kerb , inexplicably the founder of the group , who does n't want to be identified , said : ' i started it as a but of a joke really			0
' i saw a couple of bad examples and put them up and then people just started sharing their own			0
' we went from having 60 people liking our group to 2,000 in one day and it has just kept growing and growing			0
' it 's a bit of fun more than anything but it has really spiralled and got people interested			0
i think lots of people do n't like bad parking and this is their way of naming and shaming bad parkers			2
' the offending drivers often visit the site to justify the puzzling placement of their vehicle , normally followed by a torrent of righteous indignation from those affected			2
waste of space : this van is taking up two spots in a busy car park one man , whose car was blocking a pavement in a residential area , despite readily available space on the road beside it , said : ' how is this parkin like a t * * * when im parked outside my house ? ' his lack of understanding of the law and common courtesy was quickly , repeatedly and angrily pointed out by the page 's community			2
on a similar picture of a bright red @entity143 parked so that people walking along the street would be forced to step into a busy main road , someone wrote : ' i wish you a thousand buggy marks down the side of the car			0
' but there is a serious message behind the page			2
many have highlighted that poor parking is not only boorish and inconvenient , it can also be dangerous			0
all over the place : this people carrier looks as if it has been abandoned one woman , posting on a picture of a car parked entirely on a narrow pavement , said : ' people parking like this really need to think about the fact that in doing so they 're forcing mums with pushchairs , children , elderly , in fact all pedestrians , to walk on the road - all because they 're afraid that their precious cars might get a bump			1
' @entity173 to know human life is worth so little to them ! ' a @entity5 spokesman said : ' dangerous and illegal parking causes problems for pedestrians , residents , traders and other road users and the council uses civil parking enforcement to undertake parking enforcement			1
' @entity186 are a regular sighting across the borough serving residents and motorists alike			0
' we do n’t just hand out tickets , but play a vital role in keeping the town moving by keeping important routes clear and ensuring fair parking for residents , businesses and visitors			0

*facebook* page shames *dreadful* parking in @entity5
it invites users to send in pictures of *shoddily* - placed cars
irate drivers often go on site to *defend* their parking
site also has a serious message about the dangers of blocked pavements
