@entity1 had just put one over their oldest rivals in thrilling circumstances but something was gnawing away at the under 21 head coach			2
for some reason , @entity0 could n’t get over the first 25 minutes at the @entity7 , even though @entity1 had beaten @entity8 3 - 2			1
@entity1 , he felt , were overawed by @entity8 who looked a team of stars , passing smoothly in tight areas , winning cute free - kicks and making their experience tell			1
they were doing everything their numbers suggested they would			0
the numbers ? @entity21 's @entity20 , who scored @entity1 's second goal , deserves a @entity24 return @entity25 levelled for @entity1 to make it 1 - 1 in @entity27 during an impressive victory @entity29 hit the winner to give @entity0 's men a tremendous win ahead of @entity33 @entity20 : @entity34 and @entity35 considered moves for the winger last summer			1
should @entity21 fail to get promotion , he might be going up any way			0
@entity41 : currently exploring his options with his deal at @entity44 ending in june			0
@entity45 is his most likely destination			0
@entity47 : out of contract with @entity50 at the end of the season , @entity48 is convinced he will sign a new deal			0
if he ca n’t , others will be on alert			1
@entity56 : just three @entity58 games is not enough for @entity1 ’s no 3 keeper since returning to @entity35 from his @entity61 loan			1
if @entity64 does n’t moves on , he might			2
@entity65 : some may think he is too lightweight but @entity65 is an elegant player			0
if @entity61 do n’t make the leap into the @entity24 , others may try to entice him			2
@entity69 : @entity71 midfielder on loan at @entity73 , a club that suits his style			0
he would benefit from making the switch permanent			2
the team @entity77 selected had 639 top - flight appearances between them ; the squad ’s combined number was a staggering 977			1
that figure would have been more than 1,100 had key players @entity83 and @entity84 not withdrawn through injury			2
@entity90 , the @entity91 goalkeeper , is only 22 but he is playing in the @entity92 with @entity93 , @entity89 with @entity45 and @entity87 ’s goal against @entity88 in december helped @entity94 reach the last 16 of the @entity92			0
how does the top - flight experience of the @entity1 starting @entity97 measure up ? the figure is 230 , the squad ’s total is 389			1
it gives credence to the point @entity58 chairman @entity103 has made about young @entity105 players not getting sufficient opportunities but when you see the impressive way they tore into @entity8 , it makes you wonder why some ca n’t break through the glass ceiling			1
@entity0 has been deservedly praised for how he has handled things since taking over in september 2013 but a run of one defeat in 16 games — with 13 victories — is not solely down to the man in charge			0
@entity0 was not happy with the first 25 minutes of @entity1 's match against their @entity91 counterparts ‘ we want to get the ball down and score lots of goals , ’ said @entity29 , whose late goal defeated @entity8			1
‘ it ’s also down to players putting in the effort			1
’ @entity130 is one of the luckier squad members			0
with 67 @entity24 appearances , he was the most experienced starter against @entity8 and has benefited from being at @entity135 , where youth is given its head			1
so what about the rest ? experts talk about a team ’s spine but @entity1 had four players — goalkeeper @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity65 — in key positions who had never kicked a ball at the highest level			1
‘ i spoke to @entity153 about what happened in @entity8 , ’ @entity151 , the @entity45 and @entity1 legend , told @entity152 two years ago			2
‘ @entity155 said in 2002 they needed young @entity91 players to be playing regularly for their clubs to help the national team			1
‘ all the clubs are @entity91 - owned , so they feel a responsibility to the national team			2
@entity162 had to be the drivers			0
the clubs had to go through a period of not winning anything in @entity167 but look at them now			0
’ @entity65 has been linked with a number of @entity24 clubs , most notably @entity45 , but nobody has taken the plunge			0
skilful , elegant and thriving under @entity173 at @entity61 , he scored the goal against @entity175 last october which secured @entity1 ’s place at @entity33			0
@entity65 is good enough to play in the @entity24 , despite his diminutive status @entity41 showcased his talents too , and he is looking likely to ply his trade away from @entity44 @entity25 , who scored against @entity8 , is another who is benefiting from working with @entity173 but the odds are against him getting regular game time at @entity183 after his loan spell			2
but if not @entity183 , why not somewhere else in the @entity24 ? will anyone gamble on @entity20 ? the @entity21 winger , who excelled against @entity8 , believes the @entity187 has toughened him up since his side were relegated last may and a good showing in the finals this summer will help him			1
critics will argue they are not good enough or lack mental toughness but the way they played on monday does n’t back that up			0
@entity8 are the best team @entity1 have faced at this level since @entity198 at @entity199 , when they were chasing shadows before scrambling a 1 - 1 draw with a late @entity203 goal			1
the performance against @entity8 showed how much @entity1 have evolved and why they are genuine contenders to win the @entity187 , even if their numbers suggest they do n’t have enough experience			1
‘ we ’ve got good quality in the team , ’ said @entity29			0
‘ the games will be different in the summer , but we can take a lot of confidence into the tournament			0

the @entity8 under 21 side beaten by @entity215 had 639 top - flight appearances between them : the squad ’s combined number was 977
@entity8 looked a team of stars , passing smoothly in tight areas , winning cute free - kicks and making their experience tell
it gives credence to the point @entity58 chairman @entity103 has made about young @entity105 players not getting sufficient opportunities
when you see the impressive way they tore into @entity8 , it makes you wonder why some ca n’t break through the glass ceiling
