it will take about 11 trillion gallons of water -- around 1.5 times the maximum volume of the largest @entity4 reservoir -- to recover from @entity6 's continuing drought , according to a new analysis by @entity8			1
the space agency used satellite data to create an estimate of the water needed to end a drought for the first time			1
they say it will help planners , who recently found @entity6 's three year drought is the worst seen for over 1200 years			1
@entity27 satellite data reveal the severity of @entity6 's drought on water resources across the state			1
this map shows the trend in water storage between september 2011 and september 2014			2
image credit : @entity36 the finding was presented by @entity8 scientists at the @entity40 meeting in @entity41			0
' spaceborne and airborne measurements of @entity47 's changing shape , surface height and gravity field now allow us to measure and analyse key features of droughts better than ever before , including determining precisely when they begin and end and what their magnitude is at any moment in time , ' @entity42 of @entity8 's @entity36 in @entity43 said			0
' that 's an incredible advance and something that would be impossible using only ground - based observations			2
' a team of scientists used data from @entity8 's @entity66 ( @entity27 ) satellites to develop the first - ever calculation of this kind - the volume of water required to end an episode of drought			1
earlier this year , at the peak of @entity6 's current three - year drought , the team found that water storage in the state 's @entity79 and @entity80 river basins was 11 trillion gallons below normal seasonal levels			1
data collected since the launch of grace in 2002 shows this deficit has increased steadily			0
since 2011 , the @entity79 and @entity80 river basins decreased in volume by four trillion gallons of water each year ( 15 cubic kilometers )			1
that 's more water than @entity6 's 38 million residents use each year for domestic and municipal purposes			2
about two - thirds of the loss is due to depletion of groundwater beneath @entity6 's @entity98			2
in related results , early 2014 data from @entity27 's @entity100 indicate that snowpack in @entity6 's @entity104 range was only half of previous estimates			0
the observatory is providing the first - ever high - resolution observations of snow water volume in the @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity113 and @entity114 basins of the @entity104 and @entity116 watershed in the @entity117			1
to develop these calculations , the observatory measures how much water is in the snowpack and how much sunlight the snow absorbs , which influences how fast the snow melts			0
these data enable accurate estimates of how much water will flow out of a basin when the snow melts , which helps guide decision about reservoir filling and water allocation			1
the low water level of @entity6 's @entity134 , february 5 , 2014			0
now in its third straight year of unprecedented drought , @entity6 is experiencing its driest year on record , dating back 119 years and possible the worst in the past 500 years			1
' the 2014 snowpack was one of the three lowest on record and the worst since 1977 , when @entity6 's population was half what it is now , ' said @entity100 principal investigator @entity143 of @entity36			0
' besides resulting in less snow water , the dramatic reduction in snow extent contributes to warming our climate by allowing the ground to absorb more sunlight			1
this reduces soil moisture , which makes it harder to get water from the snow into reservoirs once it does start snowing again			0
' new drought maps show groundwater levels across the @entity159 are in the lowest two to 10 percent since 1949			0
a combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during @entity6 's three - year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years , according to a study accepted for publication by the @entity40 ( @entity40 )			1
' the current @entity6 drought is exceptionally severe in the context of at least the last millennium and is driven by reduced though not unprecedented precipitation and record high temperatures , ' the report 's authors said in the study released late thursday			1
the study by the @entity177 and the @entity178 said that warm , dry conditions have shrunk the supply of surface water from reservoirs , streams and the @entity104 snowpack in the state , even as demand from people and farms has gone up , resulting in unprecedented scarcity			0
@entity190 , an assistant professor in the @entity192 at the @entity177 , and @entity193 , an assistant scientist at @entity178 , asked the question , ' how unusual is the ongoing @entity6 drought ? ' and collected new tree - ring samples from blue oak trees in southern and central @entity6			1
' we were genuinely surprised at the result , ' says @entity190 , a @entity200 & @entity201 and former @entity178 postdoctoral scholar			0
' one thing is clear , drought is going to continue to happen			0
this is the kind of thing we get to see in the future			0
' the maps , developed at @entity27 's @entity209 in @entity210 , @entity211 , combine @entity27 data with other satellite observations			0
' integrating grace data with other satellite measurements provides a more holistic view of the impact of drought on water availability , including on groundwater resources , which are typically ignored in standard drought indices , ' said @entity222 , chief of the @entity223 at @entity209			2
the scientists cautioned that while the recent @entity6 storms have been helpful in replenishing water resources , they are n't nearly enough to end the multi-year drought			2
' it takes years to get into a drought of this severity , and it will likely take many more big storms , and years , to crawl out of it , ' said @entity42 .			2

current short - term drought worse than any previous span of consecutive years of drought without *reprieve*
amount of water is 1.5 times maximum volume of the largest @entity4 reservoir
experts say there is ' no doubt ' we are entering a new era where humans have changed the climate *system*
