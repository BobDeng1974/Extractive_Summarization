by @entity0 published : 09:58 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 07:04 est , 11 july 2013 an @entity2 sniper is facing jail after being found guilty of stashing an @entity5 pistol and more than 300 live rounds in his bedroom			1
sergeant @entity9 , 38 , could now be sentenced to five years in military detention			1
he was originally ordered to serve 18 months in military detention after pleading guilty in november 2012			1
but this was overturned on appeal on the basis that he had been placed under ‘ improper pressure ’ to plead guilty			0
yesterday the elite soldier said he felt ‘ great shock ’ at the court martial ’s new verdict			1
@entity31 , a veteran of 18 years , told detectives he was given the @entity33 as a war trophy by @entity5 troops he trained in the warzone in 2007			2
he said the ammunition was left over from his job as a range instructor			0
but at his six - day trial the soldier changed his story , insisting he had made a ‘ false confession ’			2
the married father - of - two blamed his confusion on memory loss caused by a brain injury suffered when he collapsed during a charity run in the @entity51 jungle in 2009			0
he said he had no recollection of receiving the weapon and explained he filled in gaps in his memory with stories other people had told him – a medical condition known as ‘ confabulation ’			0
hidden : the @entity5 glock 9mm pistol stored in @entity62 's home @entity31 had said he had no knowledge of the @entity33 and ammunition being in his bedroom and said they were put there by someone else he argued that @entity69 , serving two years in prison after admitting possessing another @entity33 , brought both pistols back from @entity5 and planted one in his bedroom to avoid a tougher sentence			1
but yesterday at @entity75 , @entity76 , the board rejected his story and found him guilty , concluding he had put the public at risk by storing the cache in his rented house in @entity81			1
@entity31 showed no emotion as the verdict was read out but his wife @entity84 struggled to fight back tears			2
@entity86 was adjourned pending a @entity88 hearing on length of punishment			0

realistically , we have to look at whether we can keep going			0
’ his wife said : ‘ he is n’t guilty and he is not a criminal			0
we know the truth , and we know most of the public know the truth			0
unfortunately we have not got the result we should have			0
