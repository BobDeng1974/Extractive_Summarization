@entity0 accepts that @entity1 need to ' get across the line ' in their pursuit of a major rugby prize that has eluded them for six years			1
not since november 2008 and the 11th game of head coach @entity0 's current 82 - @entity8 reign have @entity1 floored a southern hemisphere heavyweight			1
on that occasion it was saturday 's opening autumn test opponents @entity12 , beaten 21 - 18 just eight months after @entity1 were crowned @entity15 champions in @entity17 fashion			1
wales celebrate after beating @entity12 in november 2008 - their last win over southern hemisphere opposition five of nine subsequent defeats against the @entity12 have been by four points or less , while they twice lost by a point to @entity24 during the same period			1
' we are pretty aware we have been knocking on the door and put ourselves in situations - perhaps not against the @entity28 , but definitely against @entity24 and @entity12 - on a number of occasions to win games , ' @entity0 said			1
' we had a pretty honest debrief when we first came in ( to prepare for the autumn series )			0
' we looked at the second test in @entity24 ( @entity1 lost 31 - 10 in @entity35 five months ago ) and hopefully the things we can learn from , make sure that learning takes place and we are a bit more clinical when we get that opportunity again , if it does arise			0
head coach @entity0 is desperate for @entity1 to break their southern hemisphere hoodoo ' once you do it the first time , it becomes easier the second and the third time			1
we have been knocking at the door , but we 've got to get through it and get across the line and nail one of those victories			0
' this weekend 's clash is given added emphasis by the fact that @entity1 and @entity12 will lock horns during next year 's @entity58 in a fearsome pool that also includes highly - fancied host nation @entity60 and often - dangerous @entity62			1
the @entity12 have arrived with a new coach - former @entity64 supremo @entity63 - and found themselves dodging fall - out from @entity68 's recent brush with @entity70 rugby authorities that earned the full - back a five - figure fine			1
' a lot of people have been talking about what 's happened with @entity68 and those sort of things , and does that make them more vulnerable ? ' @entity0 added			2
' with @entity70 , it makes them stronger			0
@entity68 ( centre ) has been omitted from the @entity12 squad for disciplinary reasons ' they thrive on any adversity and any criticism , and we are expecting a really tough game on saturday			2
' i have got a massive amount of respect for what @entity63 ( @entity90 ) has achieved			0
he is the only coach who has won a @entity92 and a @entity94 title			0
' what he did with @entity64 was incredibly impressive , and what he has done with @entity97 in terms of turning them around in a pretty short time			0
' i think by his own admission it is going to take a little bit of time , but having watched him and seen him operate , it wo n't be that long			0
' he plays a really positive brand of rugby , he gets his point across pretty succinctly and he is pretty honest with the players , and they appreciate that			0
' in 10 months ' time , when they turn up for the @entity58 , i think they will be a real outfit to contend with			2
' @entity63 ( left ) has taken on the @entity12 job with a brilliant @entity115 behind him starting on saturday , @entity1 will play 12 tests before their @entity58 opener against @entity118 next september , and @entity0 has made no attempt to hide the fact that rugby 's global spectacular tops his agenda			1
' we 've really looked at the long - term plan in terms of this campaign , the @entity15 and the @entity58 , ' he said			2
' we have run things a little differently in this campaign and we will in the @entity15 , almost like @entity58 camps in terms of long - term preparation and planning			2
' it is something i think we have been pretty bold and courageous to do			0
our whole focus in the next 12 months has to be getting out of our group in the @entity58			2
that has to be our primary focus			0
@entity140 ( centre ) trains at the @entity142 ahead of saturday 's clash against @entity12 ' although we want to do exceptionally well in the autumn and in the @entity15 - and those are important games for us in making sure we perform well - the long - term objective is getting out of that group and making the ( @entity58 ) quarter - finals			1
' @entity0 , meanwhile , has confirmed that all of @entity1 ' @entity150 - based players - @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity140 , @entity153 and @entity154 - will be available for the autumn finale against @entity24 on november 29			1
@entity156 has been released back to @entity157 this week after a deal was done with the @entity161 - based @entity160 club that will see them reciprocate in terms of the @entity24 clash .			0
