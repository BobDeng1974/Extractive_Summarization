as the @entity2 , @entity1 's impressive @entity0 has already won his @entity4 account over 200,000 followers			1
but it seems the four - year - old , from @entity8 , @entity9 , has plenty of opinions about the clothes he models , too			1
in a new shoot for zulily , he poses in mom @entity18 's favorite fall must - haves			2
but while her praise is largely for items that marry versatility and durability with style , @entity1 has different reasons for liking his clothes			1
i ca n’t wait for it to rain ! ' faux leather patches on a pair of jogger pants , for instance , are great only because they ' have leg shields so i can joust on a horse			0
' a classic button - down is hailed a ' daddy shirt ' and t - shirts only pass muster if they are funny ( in this instance , pineapples and pandas wearing hipster glasses fit the bill )			2
as far as @entity18 is concerned , denim , graphic t - shirts and button - down shirts form the basis of her boys ' closets ( she is also mother to two - year - old @entity57 ) ' every boy should own a button down , ' she says			1
' they are so versatile and comfortable			0
my boys wear them constantly ! ' jogger sweats with faux leather patches : ' these pants have leg shields so i can joust on a horse ' button - down shirt : ' this shirt looks like a daddy shirt			2
i am going to go to work with him when i wear it ' denim , she adds , is ' always on trend for kids - and t - shirts do n't have to be boring			2
' if my boys wear a graphic tee it has to be a great one ! ' she says			0
' there are so many amazing designs out there that do n’t just involve the usual kid characters			0
' the @entity4 shot to fame when @entity18 began posting photos of @entity90 copying the outfits and poses of celebrities and models			1
the mother - of - two , who works full - time in publishing and runs the blog and social media feeds in her free time , admits she never anticipated this level of success when she started sharing photos of her son online			1
check blazer and pineapple tee : ' my friends at school like this jacket [ @entity1 wore it last week ]			1
i wan na eat that pineapple but he has glasses on so i ca n’t ' velvet blazer : ' this jacket is cozy			0
it feels like @entity115 [ @entity1 ’s favorite stuffed white tiger ] ' polka dot blazer and panda tee : ' i like to wear shirts with funny stuff ! the panda has a funny face and glasses			1
he also has a bumblebee on his tail , that ’s why the jacket has polka dots ' she writes on the @entity2 blog : ' we use our imaginations a ton and have a great time while doing so			0
if you see him with his hands in his pockets , he is holstering his imaginary laser guns			0
' if you see him leaning against a wall , he is trying to push it over with his body weight			0
' of course , it is a priority for @entity18 that the @entity2 project remains fun for @entity90			0
' i do n't want it to be something he does n't like doing , ' she said			0
' he is a four - year old			1
he 's not a model kid who will do whatever i say			0
' family affair : @entity1 's mother @entity157 is the real talent behind @entity2			1
younger son @entity57 ( right ) also makes occasional cameos on the @entity4 page			2

the @entity4 feed features four - year - old @entity1 and is run by his mother , @entity157
