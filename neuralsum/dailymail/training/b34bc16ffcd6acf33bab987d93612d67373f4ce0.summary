by @entity1 reporter published : 22:36 est , 18 april 2012 updated : 22:37 est , 18 april 2012 tasteless pranksters have ' desecrated ' the grave of @entity4 - by placing a pair of binoculars underneath his headstone			2
sick jokers left the binoculars by the resting place of the man who saw the fateful iceberg , along with a note saying : ' sorry for bringing these 100 years too late			2
' @entity14 issued the famous words ' @entity15 , right ahead ' when he spotted the danger from the ill - fated liner 's crow 's nest on the night of april 14 , 1912			1
stunt : the binoculars were placed under @entity4 lookout @entity24 's headstone in @entity25 , @entity26 but it was later discovered the 25 - year - old was not using vital binoculars because they 'd been locked away in a cupboard below decks			1
to make matters worse the keys to the cupboard had been taken on another ship by mistake so it could not be unlocked			1
at an inquiry into the tragedy @entity14 claimed he would have seen the iceberg sooner if he had been issued with a pair			2
pranksters who put the binoculars by the grave also left a note and removed wreaths from near the headstone @entity14 survived the sinking , which claimed 1,522 lives , but committed suicide in january 1965 - two weeks after the death of his wife			2
his grave , with a picture of the @entity4 engraved on its headstone , lies in @entity58 , @entity25 , @entity26			2
lookout : @entity24 uttered the famous words , ' @entity15 , dead ahead ' , on the night the @entity4 sank and in the past week it had been laid with wreaths as part of a special ceremony led by the @entity66 to mark centenary of the disaster			1
but now these have been taken and replaced with a pair of binoculars			2
an attached note reads : ' @entity72 , sorry for bringing these 100 years too late but better late than never ! ' the insulting note continues : ' you said if you had these , you would have had time enough to get @entity4 away from the iceberg , so here they are ! luv ( sic ) @entity78			0
' inquiries into the disaster in @entity82 and @entity83 never blamed mr @entity24 for the tragedy			1
maritime historians have also since suggested he did everything he could have at the time and had been a very conscientious lookout			0
but , despite this , he was taunted in the street about his role in the tragedy and he suffered from an incredible guilt his whole life			0
@entity95 , from the @entity66 , has blasted the removal of the wreaths from mr @entity24 's grave			1
he added : ' it is a shocking thing to have happened			0
i can not believe someone would remove a wreath - it is just astounding			0
' the binoculars are strange enough but to remove everything is disrespectful to the person who was so pivotal			0
' he added : ' you can not blame @entity24 for the disaster			1
it would have been very difficult to use binoculars on the night			0
' titanic experts say it would 've been unfair to blame @entity24 for the ship 's sinking , as using binoculars in the middle of the night would have been very difficult anyway @entity14 had worked for more than four years on @entity119 's ship oceanic before transferring to the @entity4			1
he earned five pounds a month plus an extra five shillings for the important role as lookout			0
when @entity4 began to sink on the fateful night in 1912 , @entity14 was one of the crew members assigned to man the lifeboats			1
he went on to work on @entity4 's sister ship @entity126 as a lookout and able seaman			1
he was found hanged in his garden in january 1965			0
@entity131 said he had become depressed after the death of his wife just two weeks before			0
he had an unmarked pauper 's grave until 1993 when the @entity136 paid for a headstone .			0

@entity24 uttered words , ' @entity15 , dead ahead ' before ship sank in 1912
