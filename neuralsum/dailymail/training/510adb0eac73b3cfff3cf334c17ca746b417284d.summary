by @entity0 the @entity1 is well known for her love of all things equine			0
so , there should be little doubt that when she made her historic trip to @entity8 in 2011 , one of the highlights would have been meeting the country 's top trainers , jockeys and racehorses at the @entity15 in @entity16			2
it only seems fair then that , as @entity15 president @entity19 - himself an avid racing fan - does the rounds on his state tour , she returns the favour			1
meet and greet : @entity24 ( right ) was among the horses to be introduced to racing fan president @entity19 president @entity19 was able to admire @entity28 close up , as he and he wife were given the tour by mr @entity31 and his wife @entity32 , left president @entity19 and wife @entity33 watch a horse exercise in the @entity35 at @entity36 it was in this spirit that mr @entity19 was invited to admire the @entity1 's finest animals at the @entity36 in @entity40			1
the @entity41 and his wife , @entity33 , were given the tour by trainer @entity31 - brother of tv presenter @entity45 - whose family are the current custodians of the prestigious stables			1
mr @entity19 had the chance to get up close with two of the @entity1 's prize fillies , @entity28 and @entity24 - who is running at @entity53 tomorrow			2
he was then show the stable 's facilities , including the exercise pools			0
it is not only the @entity1 who keeps her horses at @entity36 , they also look after animals from other notable owners - including former @entity63 boss sir @entity62			0
president @entity19 , left , who is an avid race fan , is talked through the facilities at the stables by @entity31 , right the trip to the stables is one of the events on the president 's historic state visit to @entity72 however , not all of the trip has been so lighthearted			1
there was a political fallout when @entity8 's deputy first minister @entity77 attended a state banquet on tuesday , especially after former @entity80 chairman @entity79 commented : ' there 's always the possibility that a member of the @entity84 will be so outraged by mr @entity77 bowing to the @entity1 that they might shoot him in the back for it			1
' president @entity19 is a regular at the @entity90 @entity92 leader @entity91 said it was unacceptable for a member of the @entity95 to support the shooting of a political leader			2
' i fully understand that @entity79 has himself been a victim of the political conflict and i regret that he has suffered grievously , ' said mr @entity91 , a former @entity102 mp and now td for @entity103 in the @entity15 parliament			0
' however , to publicly advocate the assassination of deputy first minister @entity77 is a shocking throwback to a violent past from which we are seeking to move on			0
' mr @entity91 said his party colleague and @entity111 commander mr @entity77 has worked tirelessly to ensure the success of the peace process at considerable risk to himself			0
@entity79 was injured with his wife during the 1984 @entity84 bombing of the @entity117 in @entity118			0
mr @entity77 met the @entity1 again this afternoon , at a reception held at @entity120			1
it is extremely rare for the @entity1 to host a second reception - in addition to the banquet - during a state visit			2
this is being seen as a sign of the importance the @entity1 attributes to president @entity19 's trip , following her own state visit to @entity8 , with the @entity131 , in 2011			1
there has been a level of controversy over the attendance of former @entity84 commander @entity77 , left , at events during the tour			0

president @entity19 visited the @entity139 in @entity40
the @entity15 *premier* met some of the @entity1 's finest racehorses
he was given the tour by trainer @entity31 , brother of @entity45
it was one stop in his historic state visit to @entity72
@entity77 attended another *official* event this afternoon , at @entity120
