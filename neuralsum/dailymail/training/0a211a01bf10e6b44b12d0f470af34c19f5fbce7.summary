@entity9 announced proposals for the £ 1.3m raised tomb last week , which the @entity12 has branded ' too modern and stylised '			1
the @entity9 , which is set to be the final resting place for the king , responded by saying it will not change the plans for the tomb to secure the donation			1
the proposed design for the tomb of @entity3 whose skeleton was found in @entity24 last year			2
members of the @entity12 have now withdrawn their £ 40,000 funding for the tomb because they are unhappy with the design under the current plans , the raised tomb will feature a deep carved cross and lie on a floor inlaid with a large @entity34 white rose if planning officials approve the project			1
the name of the @entity38 , his date of birth and death , along with his personal motto loyaulte me lie ( loyalty binds me ) and his boar badge will also be carved into a dark circular band around the tomb			1
@entity48 , of the @entity12 , said : ' members feel it is a very difficult design			1
they think it has been designed with the cathedral in mind , and not for a medieval warrior king			1
' what they say , and fear , is that it wo n't stand the test of time			0
i pretty much agree with that			0
' i think it is a bit too confused at the moment , a bit too busy and it does not reflect that there is a warrior king there beneath the ground			0

@entity93 @entity92 said : ' we have never banked on that money			0
' let 's be clear - the money has never come to @entity9			2
we did n't ask for it , it was attached as a ' you give us the tomb we want , and we 'll give you £ 40,000 '			1
' of course we would be very grateful for any donation from the members but we ca n't make our design hostage to their money			2
' ' @entity48 , and those writing to her , bring just a particular perspective			0
we understand it but we do n't think it can be the last word			0
' we would rather have their support , but i suppose if you put it that way i would have to say not at any price			0
' the plans unveiled last friday revealed a raised limestone tomb with a deeply carved cross , on a floor inlaid with a large @entity34 white rose			1
the tomb will be crafted from limestone quarried in @entity124 , @entity125 , near to where @entity3 underwent his boyhood training in knighthood and later made his home			0
the design is now set to be submitted to church planning officials before a final decision is made next month			0
set within the cathedral 's chancel , the £ 1.3 million pound proposals also includes changes to the @entity9 's internal layout , windows and lighting			1
church authorities had originally favoured a flat slab to mark the tomb but changed their plans in the face of strong public feedback			2

the remains of @entity3 ( pictured ) who died at the @entity151 in 1485 , were discovered by archaeologists under a council car park in @entity24 last september however , the row between the cathedral and the @entity12 is not the only obstacle to the king 's internment , which is hoped could take place next may			2
the process has been complicated by a legal challenge from a group of distant relatives of the king , the @entity165			0
they want to see the remains placed in @entity34 , where @entity3 had strong links , and last month won a judicial review of the licence that said he should go to @entity24			0
