by @entity0 published : 13:52 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 14:09 est , 8 march 2013 tragic : @entity1 , 14 , drowned at the weir on the @entity3 between @entity4 and @entity5 in july last year a 14 - year - old boy drowned in a river after being ' egged on ' to slide down a weir by a group of older boys , an inquest heard			1
@entity1 , from @entity12 , had been swimming in the @entity3 between @entity4 and @entity5 with two friends when the tragedy took place			1
the trio came across some older boys who encouraged them to slide down the steep wall into the river			1
but @entity1 , who was not a strong swimmer , failed to resurface after sliding in			1
detective sergeant @entity22 , who collated witness statements , told @entity24 : ' i do n't know if it was the first time @entity1 went down the sluice but he was egged on , and may have been encouraged , by other people who told him to have a go			1
' i do n't think they saw it as a risk			2
@entity1 said he would go first and he was very quickly followed by his two friends , @entity34 and @entity35			1
' he immediately got into difficulties , he surfaced but then seemed to go under on at least two other occasions			0
' he spat out mouthfuls of water and shouted for help from his friends , he seemed to be trying to keep his head above the water			0
' his friends told him to roll onto his back to keep afloat and @entity34 swam over and told him to grab his arm			0
' but @entity1 was panicking by this stage and grabbed @entity34 around the neck and was pulling him under			1
' @entity34 felt he was going to drown so he had to make the awful decision to leave @entity1 and swim to the side for help			1
' dangerous : the inquest heard how the weir did not have any life - saving measures and that @entity1 's friends were unable to save him despite best friend @entity55 and passer - by @entity56 attempting to rescue the schoolboy with a dinghy , @entity1 slipped under the water for a final time and never resurfaced			1
the inquest heard how temperatures peaked at 25 degrees c on the day of the tragedy on july 24 last year			1
giving evidence , mr @entity56 said : ' we were about five or 10 metres away from him and he then went under the water for the last time and the did n't come back up			0
' we stayed and waited for four to five minutes hoping he might pop up and we could rescue him , but he did n't			0
' @entity1 's body was recovered six hours later by police divers who found him resting on boulders on the river bed only a few metres from where he went under			1
@entity1 's father @entity73 condemned health and safety standards at the weir and said more needed to be done to prevent against future accidents			2
heartbreak : mountains of floral tributes were left near the lock where @entity1 drowned the inquest heard the @entity82 and @entity83 ( @entity84 ) legally hold health and safety responsibility for the lock and part of the weir , and had not put any life saving equipment at the site because they deemed it ' not necessary '			2
@entity92 , the @entity93 for the trust , said : ' signs and life rings were deemed not necessary because principally the safety of those using the river for navigation is our concern , and it was not needed			0
' our responsibility is not for the health and safety of the general public outside the lock area , this is privately owned land and their responsibility			0
' coroner @entity112 recorded a verdict of accidental death and said there was nothing his friends could have done to save the youngster			2
@entity120 on : the inquest heard that @entity1 and his friends had been sliding down the weir into the weir after being encouraged by older boys she added that she would use @entity127 , which allows coroners to suggest actions that should be taken to prevent further deaths , to order a report by the @entity82 and @entity83 into further health and safety measures			1
speaking after the inquest mr @entity1 , 39 , said he was devastated by his son 's death and had warned him from walking over the weir and swimming in the river			1
he said : ' obviously i am still devastated because i have lost my son			0
' i had warned @entity1 , he was not a strong swimmer			2
we had done a lot of fishing and i told him not to go in there but kids will be kids and they do those things , you ca n't stop them and you ca n't keep an eye on them 24/7			0
' the father - of - three also condemned the health and safety of the weir , claiming the @entity153 had not done enough to keep the area safe			0
' i feel health and safety issues need to be addressed			0
i think they could put a piece of fence to deter anyone from walking on the weir ' , he said			0
' i do n't think the @entity84 has done enough , in my eyes i think they have tried to shove the blame on to somebody else			0
' i think they could have done a little bit more , especially given the saving of somebody else only six weeks earlier			0
' since @entity1 's death three life rings have now been placed at the scene , two provided by family and friends , and one by the @entity84 , alongside a sign warning people not to swim in the river .			2
