@entity2 ’s economy will not prosper unless its ‘ mediocre ’ education system is overhauled , a hard - hitting report says today			1
failing schools and poorly performing teachers lead to a ‘ waste of human resources on a grand scale , ’ causing long - term damage to the @entity2 , the scathing document says			1
local councils which do not let failing schools close must see their wings clipped , and the system for assessing teachers must be revamped , it argues			1
written by a @entity18 - winning economist as well as former members of the @entity20 , the report from the @entity22 calls for radical change to get the @entity2 growing again			1
it says ‘ short - termist ’ banks that refuse to lend to small businesses are suffocating innovation			2
the report has been carried out by the @entity22 ( pictured ) and said failing schools are hampering the economy it also blames ‘ years of inadequate investment ’ and ‘ political procrastination ’ over the @entity2 ’s ageing transport and energy infrastructure for holding back growth			1
the symposium has spent the last year looking at ways to help the @entity2 ’s moribund economy , which is now teetering on the edge of a triple - dip recession , grow in the long term			0
the report says : ‘ after years of inadequate investment in skills , infrastructure and innovation , there are longstanding structural weaknesses in the economy , all rooted in a failure to achieve stable planning , strategic vision and a political consensus on the right policy framework to support growth			1
’ the potential of thousands of children from poorer backgrounds are being squandered by underperforming schools , it says			1
‘ our failure to provide adequate education to children from disadvantaged backgrounds constitutes a waste of human resources on a grand scale			1
‘ it holds back economic opportunities and is detrimental to growth , ’ the report states			2
co-author professor @entity73 , a former member of the @entity20 ’s influential rate - setting body , said : ‘ rarely are skills thought of as a growth issue			0
but catching up with @entity77 or @entity78 would lead to very significant increase in income for the @entity2			0
’ he suggested doubling teachers ’ probation periods from two to four years , and assessing them more on the job rather than intensely at the start of their career			1
professor @entity73 suggested doubling teachers ' probation periods to four years to raise standards at schools ( file picture ) ‘ we need to focus more on how schools are dealing with disadvantaged children – such as those on free school meals			1
that is where the big gains in growth will come from , ’ he added			2
it should be easier for underperforming schools to shrink in size , meaning fewer children join them each year , the report also says			1
it wants local councils to allow failing schools to shrink and successful schools to take on more @entity112 skills are ‘ particularly poorly developed ’ and should be made more available through more apprenticeships , it adds			2
the @entity2 ’s economy will lag until ‘ short - termist ’ banks begin lending to small businesses again , the report also says			2
a lack of competition among lenders is stifling badly - needed investment in innovation and holding back the recovery			0
the government must make it easier for new banks to enter the market , and high street giants such as @entity131 and @entity132 could even be broken up to improve competition as a last resort , it says			0
despite cutting - edge science , small and medium - sized enterprises can not get access to funding which could turn their ideas into reality			0
it says small @entity2 firms which ‘ punch above their weight ’ need to be prioritised by the government ’s new @entity145			2
professor @entity73 said we need to catch up with @entity77 or @entity78 it wants to make obtaining banking licenses easier , and remove other barriers to entry so that the pool for businesses to choose from is expanded			0
professor @entity73 said breaking up existing banks to create more players in the market was ‘ an option ’ that should only be considered as a last resort if all other schemes to improve lending fail			0
the report also slams ‘ repeated political procrastination ’ over large infrastructure projects			2
‘ nowhere is the problem of @entity2 infrastructure better illustrated than by airport capacity in the @entity171 , where generations of politicians have prevaricated to a point where there is a serious risk to @entity178 ’s position as a major hub , ’ it states			0
it calls for a new infrastructure strategy board to be created to decide on the most badly - needed projects , as well as an infrastructure bank to help secure financing			0
‘ the @entity2 has been incapable of building enough houses to keep up with growing demand , ’ it says , and also suggests that road tolls could be introduced to ease congestion			0
in response to the report , business secretary @entity189 said : ‘ the government is implementing an industrial strategy in partnership with business to tackle the very issues the @entity22 ’s @entity198 report identifies			1
‘ the two most important points coming out of the report are the need for continued investment in skills and innovation , which the department is committed to			0
‘ measures like the £ 1billion business bank to improve access to finance , a £ 75million package of investment to fund research - intensive and innovative @entity211 , investing in record numbers of apprenticeships , and sweeping away red - tape will help create economic growth			0
