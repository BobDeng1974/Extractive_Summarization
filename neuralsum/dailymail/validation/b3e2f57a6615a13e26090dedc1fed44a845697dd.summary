a @entity1 internet troll has got more than he bargained for after he was slapped with £ 100,000 in libel damages and costs after abusing a @entity6 lawyer on @entity7			1
@entity8 , 20 , from @entity9 , reaped a legal whirlwind when he posted a wounding review on @entity15 - based @entity14 's @entity13 profile			1

punishment for troll : @entity24 , 20 , from @entity9 , has been hit with £ 100,000 in libel damages and costs after abusing @entity6 lawyer @entity14 on @entity7 mr @entity14 was left fuming by the anonymous post , which seemed to be from a dissatisfied client and stated to the world that ' he loses 80 % of his cases '			1
the post remained live on the web for about a year and mr @entity14 and his firm , @entity31 , suffered severe damage to their reputations			2
mr @entity14 was not willing to let the matter rest and , at huge expense , employed a @entity37 law firm to subpoena @entity7 's records to find out who was responsible			2
that led him to the door of mr @entity8 , aged in his 20s , who was living with his parents in @entity45 , @entity9 , and ended up on the receiving end of a full - scale @entity48 libel case			1
@entity14 's law practice in @entity51 : @entity52 was ordered to pay damages after leaving abuse on the lawyer 's @entity13 profile he insisted that he bore no responsibility for the post and that his @entity7 account must have been hacked by someone else			1
he said that a hacker might have been seeking revenge for something he had done as a ' moderator ' of the www.reddit.com website			0
however , judge sir @entity66 said hacking into mr @entity8 's account would have been challenging , with the perpetrator needing to bypass passwords and sophisticated security			0
there was no indication that anyone held a grudge against him and the judge described the hacking explanation as ' extremely improbable '			0
the ' overwhelming probability ' was that that mr @entity8 had either authored the post himself or authorised it			0
mr @entity8 was ordered by the court to pay £ 50,000 damages , along with mr @entity14 's legal costs , of which he must pay £ 50,000 on account the judge added : ' why mr @entity8 should himself choose to attack mr @entity14 and his firm is unclear , but the most likely explanation would appear to be a purely financial one '			2
taking into account the ' grapevine effect ' on the internet , the judge had no doubt that the post had caused serious damage to mr @entity14 and his firm 's good name			0
he ordered mr @entity8 to pay £ 50,000 damages , along with mr @entity14 's legal costs			2
he must pay £ 50,000 of those on account , pending final assessment of the costs bill			0
mr @entity14 's solicitor , @entity100 , said later : ' this is a great result for our clients			0
' their reputations have at last been vindicated following this calculated attack through the medium of an online review site ' he said that mr @entity8 's post may well have been ' solicited ' by others and mr @entity14 would continue his legal fight on both sides of the @entity113 to find out who may have been responsible			1
mr @entity115 - @entity100 added : ' we hope that this decision sends a message that fake negative reviews have a real impact on real people and those who post them can and will be held accountable			0

@entity52 , 20 , from @entity9 was sued by @entity6 lawyer @entity14
the @entity15 lawyer had received abuse on a @entity13 profile
