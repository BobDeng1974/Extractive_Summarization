by @entity0 it 's 23 years since the bodies of @entity3 , 16 and @entity4 , four , were discovered in the tiny town of @entity6 , @entity7 and all that remained of @entity9 , her clothes , bagged and weighted down with rocks in the @entity12			1
all the victims were indigenous and the families say if they had been white and living in suburbia instead of being black and from an @entity18 mission , the murders would have been solved long ago			1
now a senior homicide detective is about to give evidence at a parliamentary inquiry that a serial killer operating in the country town where the three children disappeared in the early 1990s escaped justice because police failed to properly investigate			1
submissions to the inquiry will say the families were failed and assumptions were made that when @entity18 children disappeared they had just ' gone walkabout '			1
@entity4 , four , ( left ) and @entity9 , 16 ( right ) both went missing parties on the @entity18 mission outside the @entity7 town of @entity6 in 1990			1
local police suggested the kindergarten pupil was a runaway , but her partially decomposed body was found the following year on a dirt track near the river , in which ms @entity9 's clothes were found weighted down with rocks after @entity47 , 16 , disappeared in 1991 from a local man 's caravan where he and his girlfriend had been sleeping , his body was found two weeks later dumped along the same bush track as four - year - old @entity4			1
no attempt was made to conceal either body and both appeared to have suffered significant blows to the head detective inspector @entity57 of the @entity58 will tell the @entity59 in relation to the @entity61 on thursday that the three child murder cases should be considered together and that there would be a reasonable chance of identifying and convicting the ' serial killer '			1
one suspect in 1991 was a local tannery worker , @entity66 , a white man then in his twenties			0
@entity66 was charged with the murders of @entity3 and @entity4			1
after a judge , justice @entity69 of the @entity70 , ruled that @entity66 could not be tried for the two murders together , @entity66 was tried and acquitted of the murder of @entity3 in 1994 , and of the murder of @entity4 in 2006			1
nobody was charged with the murder of @entity9			2
inspector @entity57 's submission , along with others from @entity18 language and cultural experts , and the victims ' families will point to a lack of forensic evidence being gathered at the time of the murders , of the disappearances not being taken seriously and the two cases which were prosecuted being treated ' apathetically '			1
a community divided : the white community in the tiny country town of @entity6 did not mix with the local aboriginals from the mission on the road out of town until a local man started taking alcohol and cannabis to mission parties with indigenous people @entity4 's mother did not realise the four - year - old was missing until late the following day after she was apparently kidnapped from a bedroom			1
the girl 's body was n't found till months later @entity106 , the sister - in - law of @entity47 , organised a protest outside @entity109 @entity108 last november which led to the inquiry			2
she said the treatment of the murders was a 24 - year - old sham and had been so from the start			0
' from the time they disappeared it has been [ a sham ] , ' she said			0
' i am a white person , and if i went missing the police would n't go and ask if i 'd just gone walkabout , or like they did of @entity9 's mother if she might have gone because she 'd just got pregnant			1
' they also asked her if she was actually @entity123 's mother , because @entity9 was light - skinned			2
' there was no forensic evidence taken from the house from which @entity4 disappeared and she was treated as a runaway			2
she was four years old , and had left behind a shoe			0
former @entity6 man , @entity130 ( interviewed , above , on the @entity133 's @entity132 programme ) has been tried and acquitted on the murders of @entity3 and @entity4 a poster from the protest in november last year staged by members of @entity6 's @entity18 community outside @entity108 in @entity139 , which sparked a state inquiry into the murders of @entity9 ( left ) , @entity3 ( centre and @entity4 more than 23 years ago ' @entity3 's disappearance was taken a little but more seriously because his body was found three weeks later			1
even so , there was an eye witness who identified the man standing over @entity3 's body on the road at the time he disappeared and that was taken by the police but not used			1
' there are families and communities in many places and towns who are still suffering and paying for the mistakes made by police all these years later			2
' the first victim of the @entity6 killer was @entity9 , who in september 1990 arrived from her home 60 km north , to the community of around 150 @entity18 and 750 white people			1
few of the white townsfolk fraternised with the @entity166 on the mission , except @entity66			0
a police officer will tell the inquiry that the murders of @entity4 ( above ) and teenagers @entity3 and @entity9 should be tried as serial killings in the one court hearing on her first or second day in @entity6 , the 16 - year - old attended a party at the mission , at which there was alcohol and cannabis , known as ' yarni '			1
@entity180 got very drunk and failed to meet her friends to take the 3am train out			0
her mother did not find out she was missing until days later			0
the following month , on october 3 , after another party at the mission , a drunk @entity185 took her three children , including four - year - old @entity4 to their father , @entity191 's house , but found he was too inebriated to mind them			0
back at her mother 's house , @entity193 fell asleep with the children only to wake up the next morning to find @entity4 gone			0
assuming the child had walked down in daylight to see her father , @entity193 did n't realise @entity4 was missing until she caught up with @entity191 later in the day			2
in january 1991 , @entity3 was visiting from his home in the country town of @entity202 , five hours north - west of @entity6			1
@entity3 attended another party at the mission			0
the teenager disappeared and the discovery of his body dumped on a dirt track seven kilometres out of @entity6 sparked the first suspicions by police of a murder at the mission			2
the next remains to be discovered were when a fisherman snagged @entity180 's clothes in the river near that track and , thereafter , @entity4 's decomposed body			0
police charged @entity130 with the murders of @entity3 and @entity4 , having identified similarities in the deaths and identifying a possible sexual motive , in that @entity66 allegedly wanted to have sex with someone in each victim 's company at the time of their disappearance			1
a supreme court judge decided to try the cases separately , making evidence about the @entity180 and @entity4 deaths inadmissable at @entity66 's 1994 trial for @entity3 's murder			2
more than a decade later , @entity66 was tried and acquitted for the @entity4 murder			2
inspector @entity57 , who was not part of the original murder investigations , took up the case in 1997 and has since taken carriage of the families ' fight for justice			0
@entity106 told the @entity244 the families of the murder victims and the wider indigenous community were grateful this latest inquiry might give them another opportunity for the cases to be investigated and tried			2
' we hope something comes of it , ' she said			0
' it was because of these cases that the laws were changed surrounding double jeopardy [ in which a person can not be tried a second time after being acquitted once on the same charge ] , ' ms @entity106 said ' the law now says a case can be retried if the evidence is fresh and compelling			0
we hope they will listen and and decide something has to be done			0
' it has been a very long time and the murders still affect people 's lives			0
@entity271 , told the @entity244 her son was an innocent man who had been unfairly targeted for almost a quarter of a century			0
' it 's been absolute terror , ' said mrs @entity271 , who still lives in @entity6			0
' it 's affected our whole family and my health , but [ the police ] stop at him and do n't go any further			0
