playing shoot ' em up games ' trains ' gamers to use real guns - and specifically to aim for ' instant kills ' by shooting people in the head			1
@entity10 mass murderer @entity9 admitted to using @entity11 as a training aid before the @entity13 - and the new discovery raises fears that other groups such as @entity17 could use the games in the same way			1
players used a pistol - shaped controller in a shoot ' em up , then a real gun on a mannequin - the gamers had 99 % more hits in the head than non-gamers			1
call of duty : players used a pistol - shaped controller in a shoot ' em up , then a real gun on a mannequin - the gamers had 99 % more hits in the head than non-gamers @entity9 admitted to using @entity11 as a ' training aid ' before his massacre - now a scientific study has shown that shoot em ups do hone real - world shooting skills ¿ the more frequently one plays violent shooting games , the more accurately one fires a realistic gun and aims for the head , although we ca n't tell from this study which factor is the cause , @entity45 said players who had ' trained ' using games also had 33 % more shots that hit other parts of the body			1
the study found that participants who reported habitual playing of violent shooting games also were more accurate than others when shooting at the mannequin , and made more head shots			1
it 's not surprising that video games can improve shooting accuracy -- the military , police departments and others already use video games for training purposes , said @entity72 , co-author of the study and a professor of communication and psychology at @entity77			2
but this is the first study to show that average players using violent shooting games with realistic human targets can improve firing aim and accuracy			0
‘ for good and bad , video game players are learning lessons that can be applied in the real world , ’ @entity45 said			0
‘ the more frequently one plays violent shooting games , the more accurately one fires a realistic gun and aims for the head , although we ca n't tell from this study which factor is the cause , ’ @entity45 said			1
@entity45 said these results should give parents and policymakers pause			0
‘ we should n't be too quick to dismiss violent video games as just harmless fun in a fantasy world – they can have real - world effects , ’ he said			1
brutal : @entity9 said he spent up to 16 hours per day playing the violent @entity11 video game in preparation for the attacks @entity10 mass murderer @entity9 described how he became a deadly marksman by honing his gun skills by playing the violent @entity11 : @entity106 computer game			1
the mass killer even bought a special gun sight used on the game - and attached it to the hunting rifle he used for his deadly rampage on a @entity10 island			1
the @entity11 , such as the @entity114 game , have often been cited as violent games the researchers say that policymakers should examine their attitude to shoot ' em up games - and whether they really are ' harmless fun ' the study involved 151 college students who first completed questionnaires measuring their aggression levels and their attitude toward guns , and asked about their firearms training , their favorite video games , and how often they played them			1
they then spent 20 minutes playing one of three different video games : a violent shooting game with realistic human targets that rewarded head shots ( @entity136 ) ; a nonviolent shooting game with bull 's - eye targets ( the target practice game in @entity140 ) ; or a nonviolent , non-shooting game ( @entity143 )			1
for the two shooting games , the participants either played with a standard controller including a joystick , or used a pistol - shaped controller			2
immediately after playing the video game , all participants shot 16 ‘ bullets ’ at a 6 - foot tall , male - shaped mannequin covered in @entity152 at the end of a narrow hallway , 20 feet ( 6.1 meters ) away			0
the gun – a black airsoft training pistol -- had the same weight , texture and firing recoil of a real 9mm semi-automatic pistol			0
the ‘ bullets ’ were .43 caliber rubber training rounds covered in soft @entity152			0
all participants were instructed in the use of the pistol and wore safety goggles			0
participants who played the shooting game using a pistol - shaped controller completed the most head shots at the mannequin ( an average of about 7 )			1
they were also the only group who completed more head shots than they did shots to other parts of the mannequin			0
‘ we did n't tell them where to aim – we just told them to try to hit the mannequin , ’ @entity45 said			2
‘ but the violent shooting game they played rewarded head shots , and so they shot at the mannequin like they were playing the game , aiming for the head			2
’ participants who played the nonviolent , non-shooting game had the fewest head shots , an average of about 2			0
those who played the other games , including those who played the violent shooting game with a standard controller , fell in between those extremes			0
participants who played the violent shooting game with the pistol - shaped controller also made the most shots to other parts of the mannequin , averaging slightly more than 6			2
those who played the nonviolent , non-shooting game made an average of about 4 shots to other parts of the mannequin , the least of any group			0
all of the differences among the groups regarding total hits and head shots stayed the same even after taking into account the participants ' levels of aggressiveness , attitudes toward guns and firearm experience			0
when the researchers examined the participants ' experience playing video games , they found that those who habitually played violent shooting games had more total hits and head shots to the mannequin when compared to less experienced players			1
tragic : @entity9 also spent hours on the fantasy game @entity235 as he set himself up for the massacre some killers have credited video games for helping them prepare , he said			2
for example , @entity9 , the @entity10 man who shot and killed 69 people at a youth camp in @entity10 last year , wrote in a manifesto : ‘ i see @entity243 ( @entity243 ) more as a part of my training - simulation than anything else			1
you can more or less completely simulate actual operations			0
’ @entity45 said he 's not claiming that these games necessarily lead people to commit violent crimes			0
‘ but this study suggests these games can teach people to shoot more accurately and aim at the head , ’ he said .			2
