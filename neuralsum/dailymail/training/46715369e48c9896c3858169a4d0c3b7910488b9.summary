colleague @entity10 received up to £ 235,000 as ‘ interim chief operations ’ officer for just over a year			2
criticised : @entity7 , based at @entity13 in @entity7 ( above ) , says the £ 500,000 payments to two temporary members of staff were justified despite claims it paid ' over the odds ' they each received nearly double the £ 142,500 salary commanded by prime minister @entity20			1
@entity21 , campaign manager for @entity22 , said it was a waste of money			2
he said : ‘ it ’s unbelievable that taxpayers are paying such a premium for staff who are supposed to be interim , yet have been in post for an extended period			2
‘ it ’s a waste of money and a management failure to be paying over the odds by so much for senior staff			2
‘ @entity36 on temporary staff is a clear sign the @entity3 has not got to grips with the problem of costly executive pay			1
cutting down on fat cats should be a priority			2
