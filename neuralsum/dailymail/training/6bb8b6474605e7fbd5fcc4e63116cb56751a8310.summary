he made the remark yesterday after hearing that one - year - old @entity15 had been looked after by clinical support workers who had made errors on her medical notes			1
this included ‘ incorrect ’ entries and one afternoon that saw an eight - hour gap in observation notes on @entity4 ’s condition			1
the little girl died of a massive heart attack at @entity7 after medical staff ignored her family ’s desperate pleas to help her			0
at one stage , her despairing mother even offered a £ 100 ‘ bribe ’ to a nurse to pay more attention to @entity4			2
yesterday , coroner @entity34 heard that , in the days before she died , @entity4 was put under the care of clinical support workers			1
these are @entity38 workers who are paid less than qualified nurses and recruited for their ‘ commitment and enthusiasm ’ rather than any academic qualifications			0
the coroner said : ‘ this was more “ work experience ” , somewhat ? ’ senior nurse @entity45 , manager of the ward @entity4 was on , denied this , replying : ‘ no , not work experience			1
they go through a period of six to eight months ’ training , including observation , monitoring and how to read notes			0
’ but mrs @entity45 conceded that the clinical support workers looking after @entity4 had made ‘ incorrect ’ entries on her medical notes			1
@entity15 was born with a hole in her heart , and had to undergo surgery aged 10 - months - old to correct it it was during the recovery from the surgery when complications arose , ultimately leading to her tragic death she also accepted that , on one day , they had failed to update the notes all afternoon , leaving an eight - hour gap in observations of @entity4 ’s condition			1
hourly observations were supposed to be done to help doctors correctly assess @entity4 , the inquest heard			1
mrs @entity45 , who agreed nurses had ignored the hospital ’s policy of hourly check - ups , said there were not enough nurses to go round			2
she added that @entity4 was being monitored by machines which sounded an alarm if there was any problem – but agreed that these alarms were often ignored			1
@entity1 told an inquest her one - year - old daughter was overlooked and neglected at the hospital she said : ‘ at that time , we had a high number of patients who needed high dependency care			1
nurses often have three patients			0
they ca n’t put down children and go to the alarm every time			0
’ @entity98 , representing @entity4 ’s family , put it to mrs @entity45 that @entity4 was put under the care of clinical support workers because nurses regarded her condition as less serious than other children on the ward			1
@entity4 was born with a blockage which stopped blood reaching her lungs			2
she was operated on shortly after her birth in @entity111 , and sent for further surgery in @entity113 in october 2009			0
@entity15 with her grandparents , @entity115 and @entity116 , both helped keep a bedside vigil for the four weeks @entity4 spent in hospital before her death the operation was a success but complications arose when staff inserted a tube into @entity4 incorrectly , causing her lung to collapse			0
her parents and grandparents kept a vigil by her bedside but failed to convince staff to take the baby off the ward and put her into intensive care			0
she died on november 11 , 2009 , after both her lungs collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest			0
her mother @entity1 , 40 , who now lives in @entity138 , has told the inquest : ‘ all along , the family had expressed their concerns about @entity4 ’s breathing and had even asked if there was a problem with her lungs , yet nothing was done			2
’ @entity4 ’s family have accused the hospital of ‘ abominable ’ failings in her care , which they described as ‘ brutal ’			0
the inquest at @entity152 continues .			0
