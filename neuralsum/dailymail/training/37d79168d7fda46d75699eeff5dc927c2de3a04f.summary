by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 11:03 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 11 april 2013 @entity3 today revealed his great regret at quitting @entity6 's government , leaving her ' at the mercy of her friends '			1
the former @entity10 party chairman bemoaned how @entity6 was ousted from power not by the voters but by her conservative colleagues			1
staring down the chamber towards former foreign secretary , @entity15 of @entity16 , whose dramatic resignation sparked the @entity6 's political demise in 1990 , @entity3 told peers he wished he had stood by her			1
three years later he stood down from the @entity37 , to look after his wife			2
he told the @entity29 : ' my regrets ? i think i do regret that because of the commitments i had made to my own wife that i did not feel able either to continue in @entity42 after 1987 or to return to @entity42 when she later asked me to do and i left her , i fear , at the mercy of her friends			1
' he added that he was grateful for how she allowed him to run his office ' from my hospital bed ' for three months while he recovered from his injuries			0
@entity6 joined the @entity29 in 1992 after standing down as an mp ' i would like to say how grateful i will always be for the fact that she gave me the opportunity to serve in high office the country that she and i , and i believe all of us here , love , ' he said			1
and in a swipe at the @entity10 mps who refused to back her as leader in 1990 , @entity3 said : ' she was brought down in the end not by the electorate , but by her colleagues			2
' not only is it quite remarkable that she won three elections running - someone else has done that since - what was remarkable is that she polled slightly more votes on the occasion of her third victory when she had been in office eight years than on her first and i regard that as a triumph for her			2
' he said his life as @entity10 chairman was made much easier by ' the certainty of her beliefs '			1
' i was never asked by her to commission a focus group , " he said			0
' had i been so , i would have resisted manfully			0
' but he said he had not always agreed with her			0
' i recollect one occasion when i left her office in @entity91 , walked back over to @entity92 , got into my office and asked my private secretary if there had been any calls from @entity91			0
' no , secretary of state , ' he said			0
so i knew i was still the secretary of state			0
' former @entity10 leader @entity98 of @entity99 said : ' there are very , very few people who have made a difference on the scale @entity6 achieved			1
she saved our country , she helped bring freedom to half our continent			0
the light of her legacy will shine like a beacon down the generations			1
' he added : ' it has said many times that she was a divisive figure			0
she was , she had to be			0
there was no consensus about the right thing to do to save our country			0
' and if she had waited for consensus nothing would ever have happened			0
she saw what needed to be done and she did it , with clarity , with courage , with conviction			0
' conservative leader in the @entity29 , @entity129 , lead the debate telling peers : ' whatever our views and whatever our backgrounds , i think we would all agree that she made a huge difference to the country she loved , that she helped to pick @entity137 up off its knees , that she changed our place in the world and that she transformed the very shape of our political debate			1
' and i think we would also agree that she was a staunch defender of our parliamentary system and the part it should play in our national life			0
' speeches : lord @entity98 and @entity149 also took to their feet to praise the @entity6 and share memories former @entity153 leader @entity149 hailed @entity6 as ' without doubt the commanding politician and greatest prime minister of our age '			1
@entity149 said she restored the @entity137 's position in the world and was far better than any man in politics			2
and he revealed the surprise reaction of his left - leaning wife , @entity165 , on meeting @entity6 at a @entity167 reception			2
@entity168 remarked : ' she 's absolutely bloody charming , dammit ! ' @entity170 , in a speech peppered with humour and greeted with warm laughter from many in the @entity29 , recalled sitting next to @entity6 in 2003 , the year her husband died and a year after she suffered a series of minor strokes			1
' by some reason of serendipity for about five years , at the state opening of @entity182 , i found myself sitting on that bench there next to @entity6 and spending time with her before we awaited the @entity188 's arrival , ' the leader of the @entity153 in the @entity29 said			1
' the one thing i want to share with the @entity29 was in the year her husband died and when she had already had a number of minor strokes and she did n't speak a great deal			1
' but suddenly she turned to me and said ' my husband died earlier this year '			2
' and i said ' yes , i know @entity6 '			2
' she paused again and then said " i miss him very much "			0
' tribute : one peer , @entity170 , described how @entity6 and @entity196 were a ' tremendous partnership ' and told how , after he died , the @entity198 said how much she missed her husband mr @entity6 was ' absolutely central ' and key to @entity6 's ability to become what she was , @entity199 said			1
' according to sir @entity196 , at one stage he was sitting at home in his flat in @entity206 and mrs @entity6 was ironing his shirt , something she was very keen on doing , getting breakfast , ironing his shirt , ' @entity202 said			1
' she said in a rather casual sort of way ' @entity196 , i 'm thinking of running for the leadership ' , to which he responded ' leadership of what @entity36 ? ' ' that somehow summed up the wonderful balance , detachment and humour of sir @entity196 and i ca n't undermine too strongly the extent to which i think mrs @entity6 began to lose her life when he passed away			1
' he was absolutely central and key to her whole personality , the ability to become what she was			0
' @entity202 , who sat opposite @entity6 on the @entity230 front benches as a @entity233 minister during the 1970s , said she disagreed with her policies which were ' terribly hard on the @entity235 and the @entity236 '			2
she also criticised @entity6 for not embracing other cultures			2
' i think her policies did not completely reflect the common ground that we were beginning to develop as a multi-cultural and multi-racial nation and to me that is a very important part of what we are about today			0
' views : @entity199 also spoke movingly about @entity6 's relationship with @entity196 and his unfailing support for her in their 52 years of marriage @entity233 's @entity250 admitted that many on the left still feel angry towards @entity6 , even three decades after she became prime minister			1
' for some , including some on my benches and in my part of the political spectrum , @entity6 , as she was then , was someone who was a divisive figure , someone to whom they were and remain fundamentally opposed , ' the @entity254 said			2
' someone whose very name , even now , more than 30 years since she became @entity137 's prime minister in 1979 , can raise heights of emotion , of passion , of anger , despair , and more			1
someone who they believe can never be forgiven for what she did to individuals , to communities , to industries , and to the country			0
' that is a legitimate position of disagreement to hold - but to hold parties to celebrate a death of someone is wrong and in bad taste , and something i deplore			0
