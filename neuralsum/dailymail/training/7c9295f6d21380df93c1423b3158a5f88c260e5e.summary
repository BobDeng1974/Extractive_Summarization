finding nice things to write about @entity1 is n’t a challenge			2
answering the unanswered questions remains the big issue with this @entity6 legend			0
i ’m not talking about the reasons behind his departure – @entity6 have their side of the story , @entity1 ’s allies will have his side			1
but he ’s too decent a guy to openly encourage criticism of the club he has been a massive part of for so many years			0
there are two questions that still need analysis in my view : first , should @entity1 have left @entity6 at some point in his career ? my answer is yes , and it ’s not with the benefit of hindsight			1
@entity1 announced he will quit @entity6 at the end of the season to play in the @entity30 @entity1 prepares to take a corner in @entity6 's @entity32 third round win over @entity34 on monday @entity1 's display in the 2005 @entity37 final was arguably the best individual performance ever @entity1 rises above the @entity40 defence to score and start @entity6 's comeback in the 2005 final in @entity43 forget @entity44 and @entity45 , no fictional superhero comes close to what the real thing achieved in @entity43 in 2005			1
@entity1 ’s performance was from the most excitable , over-dramatic comic book of all time			0
it ranks as one of the very best individual performances in a football match the world has ever seen , if not the very best			0
what makes it even more remarkable is that @entity59 went through that @entity37 - winning season feeling unwanted by @entity6 , unsure about the direction in which the club was going , and with his family witnessing disgusting abuse towards him from @entity6 fans			1
@entity1 was able to rise above that to guarantee a place in @entity6 , and football , history			1
that in itself is a measure of the man , and it is why the time was right straight after that @entity37 victory for @entity1 to leave @entity76			1
@entity1 's loyalty to @entity6 meant he never collected a coveted @entity79 medal @entity80 managed to persuade @entity1 to stay at @entity6 in 2004 despite interest from many big clubs @entity1 is consoled by @entity83 after scoring an own goal in the 2005 @entity86 final in 2004 @entity1 had been linked with a move to @entity88 , whose new manager at the time , @entity83 , spoke highly and openly about the @entity6 captain			1
@entity1 saw the speculation and told @entity6 he wished to stay but that he also wanted guarantees that the squad would be strengthened as they struggled to compete for the title			1
throughout the 2004 - 05 season , while @entity1 was ripping up trees across @entity96 , @entity6 failed to put a new contract on the table for him , yet @entity80 was in his ear telling him to sign a new deal			1
@entity80 had already told @entity1 privately that the club did not have a lot of money to spend in the transfer market , so the captain wanted to know how @entity6 planned to compete with players like @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 in their ranks			1
and then the moment that for me should have sealed @entity1 ’s departure : february 27 , 2005 , when @entity114 hosted the @entity86 final			2
@entity83 and @entity1 meet during the 2005 @entity86 in @entity114 - but he never joined @entity88 @entity116 ( left ) and @entity117 lift the @entity86 for @entity88 after @entity1 's own goal rescued them @entity6 led from the first minute , @entity1 ’s own goal levelled it with just over 10 minutes to go , and @entity88 went on to win in extra-time			1
@entity1 ’s mum was in the stands , and around her some @entity6 fans were calling the captain a ' traitor ' and calling his wife a ' slag ' and a ' slut ' and accusing him of only being interested in money			1
according to those fans , @entity1 had scored the own goal because he wanted to join @entity88			1
his mum was distraught , and so was @entity1			0
still this colossus played his heart out for the club and the fans , and that special night in @entity43 came just a few months after the @entity88 defeat in @entity114			2
after the @entity37 final @entity1 told the club he was ready to sign for five years at @entity6			1
even then nobody at @entity76 seemed in a hurry to sort out @entity1 ’s new deal			1
@entity142 , @entity143 , @entity40 , @entity144 and @entity88 had all shown serious interest in signing @entity1			2
he was n’t short of options at home or abroad			0
leading @entity6 to @entity96 glory was the perfect riposte to the critics after transfer speculation all was forgiven by the fans after @entity1 's heroic performance in @entity43 , delivering a fifth @entity37 his stunning effort and quality had been the key factor in winning the @entity37 , but they were miles off winning the @entity79 title he craved			1
@entity1 could work miracles in certain matches , but not over a 38 - game season			0
he felt badly treated by the club , he had been abused by a pocket of fans , and the surplus of mediocre signings showed the club ’s ambition did not match his			0
he ’d proved anything that needed proving in @entity43			0
the summer of 2005 was the time for @entity1 to seek a new challenge			2
i admire his loyalty of course , but in my view it was misplaced , and that ’s when he should have left			0
and now , less than a year after quitting @entity175 to focus on @entity6 , the club have not matched @entity1 ’s loyalty by making it so easy for him to leave			1
second , was he better than @entity177 ? again my answer is yes , and that has been confirmed for me by the lack of class @entity177 has shown towards @entity88 and its fans this season			2
a simple text from a @entity88 - supporting friend of mine on @entity187 read : ' @entity187 ! @entity177 – what a w * * * * * ! ' @entity177 oining @entity188 on loan from @entity190 after a long career with @entity88 @entity177 's legendary status at @entity193 is in danger of being revoked after moving to @entity188 @entity177 was rightly revered by @entity88 fans but the mood has changed among the @entity198 faithful @entity177 is a @entity79 legend , and while the record books will mark his contribution to @entity88 ’s incredible years of success with him sparkling in their midfield , that legend status among the @entity193 faithful is in danger of being revoked			1
to go to their title rivals is bad enough			0
to choose to stay there for the whole season is a slap in the face to the @entity88 fans			0
it ’s something i do not believe @entity1 would do to the @entity6 fans			2
in terms of their ability on the pitch , @entity177 shows class at getting into the box from midfield and scoring goals			0
@entity1 has so much more and he has been class at virtually everything he has done			0
@entity1 is a born leader as well , a classic captain			0
he ’s made a team shine despite being surrounded by mediocrity , @entity177 only ever did it with quality players around him			0
@entity177 and @entity1 could have worked together for @entity175 but were played in the wrong system if @entity175 had played three in midfield – @entity229 behind @entity1 and @entity177 – they could have played together			2
but even our foreign coaches seemed obsessed with 4 - 4 - 2			0
in the @entity233 in 2006 , @entity232 told @entity1 to hold back while @entity177 went forward			2
what kind of coach thinks telling a player like @entity1 in his prime to play within himself is a good idea ? people will have different views on whether @entity1 should have left @entity6 , and whether he was better than @entity177			1
let the debate rage on			0
all i know is that i will miss @entity1 , the @entity79 will miss him			0
and i believe @entity6 will lack leadership and quality when a man regarded by many as their greatest ever player has departed .			0

@entity1 will leave @entity6 in the summer for the @entity30
but the midfielder should have left @entity76 in 2005
@entity1 suffered disgusting abuse as he *wavered* over a contract
he heroically rose above it to deliver @entity6 a fifth @entity37
even then , the club seemed *relaxed* about offering him a long - term deal
@entity177 's *disloyalty* to @entity88 proves @entity1 was superior
