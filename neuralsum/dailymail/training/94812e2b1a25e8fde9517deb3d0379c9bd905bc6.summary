yup , you could say that determined former model @entity1 has put her heart and soul into trying to win tonight 's @entity4			1
' oh my @entity5 ! ' she shrieks when she thinks about it			2
' i went for it			2
i pushed myself so out of my comfort zone that i was out of control			2
and then , after two hours of cooking , i collapsed on the floor from exhaustion			1
literally , fell in a heap			2
' @entity1 , 35 , was the underdog in the show from the start			1
as a former waif like model who had not eaten puddings for 15 years , she only started cooking when she had son @entity23 nearly three years ago			1
' it is pure determination that got me to the final , ' she says			1
' i gave my heart , a hundred million percent			1
' that has meant practising dishes in the early hours of the morning - the only time she did n't have to film or be mummy - and then , a few hours later , cooking again in front of the cameras			1
' for the first few weeks i was so insecure about the whole thing that i kept thinking to myself , ' oh my @entity5 , oh my @entity5 , why am i here ? what am i doing ? but slowly i started to believe in myself			2
i 've never worked so hard but it has been the most incredible experience i have ever been through			0
' after the sad despatch of little perfectionist @entity53 last night , the 20 original contestants have now been whittled down to three			0
along with determined and competitive @entity1 is her polar opposite - quiet but assured actress @entity55			1
and the final member of the trio to make it to the end is big meaty cooker , @entity62 television presenter @entity61			1
' i did n't think i would ever get to the final but i dared to hope , ' says @entity55 , 52 , little sister of @entity64			1
' it feels really special to have got this far and to have had the chance to work with so many brilliant and different people			0
' she says she entered because she thought it might be an adventure			0
and it has ; all of the finalists describe it as a rollercoaster			0
' one night as we watched the show years ago one of my sons said to me , ' @entity77 , you should try this and i said something along the lines of , ' do n't be ridiculous ' only i was probably not that polite			1
competition : @entity61 says being on the show has given him a real adrenaline rush fighting chance : @entity55 , sister of actress @entity64 , is also in with a shout tonight but somewhere in my head a wee thought piped up and whispered ; actually perhaps i would like to try that			1
' i feel so lucky to have been able to do it ; to meet and work with such wonderful , funny , generous people			0
but while i knew it would be a challenge , i do n't think i realised just how much of a challenge it would be			0
' @entity61 , 47 , known for his thrill - seeking adventure programmes says being on the show has given him as much as of an adrenalin rush as any of his ' more stupid ' - and dangerous - acts			0
' some of the challenges were brilliant fun , ' he says			0
' it has been a real emotional rollercoaster ; from the week when i was too wildly ambitious and tried to make a meal from scratch including my own pasta to the joy of coming up with our own dishes at the olympic park			1
' he says he was always quietly confident as a cook - until he started on the show			0
' you quickly realise that even if you are a half decent cook your scope of food is actually quite narrow			0
' suddenly you are pushed to do things you have never done before and that 's when you realise that you are not as good as you thought you were			0
it is a very steep learning curve and you either sink or swim			0
' in tonight 's show the contestants face their toughest challenge yet knowing the stakes could n't be higher			1
for their first challenge they have to cook at top @entity128 restaurant @entity129 for @entity131 's @entity128 ' cooking mafia ' @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			2
' cooking for some of the top chefs in the land was scary , ' admits @entity61			2
' it was a terrifying prospect and slightly unfair			0
these people are the @entity142 of chefs and they have been cooking all their lives			2
' @entity55 also admits she found the challenge the most difficult yet			1
' it was my hardest moment ; i never felt quite that i understood or connected to what i was making , ' she says			0
battling it out : @entity61 , @entity1 and @entity55 will go head to head in tonight 's final ' i became very emotional because everybody was really helping me and wanting me to do better but i was really out of my depth			1
i was frustrated in myself as i had fallen so short of the excellence that was clearly required			0
' even @entity1 , who ' does n't do blubbing ' , admits she could n't help herself from crying like a baby after the challenge			1
once she had picked herself off the floor , that is			0
' i had a little blub when [ @entity162 ] @entity161 went because he is a good friend but generally i do n't cry a lot			0
' but in the final , when the chefs were tasting my food , i had a complete meltdown			2
i had given so much			0
i had very little left			0
' the final challenge of the series was cooking a three course meal for the show 's ever present hosts @entity171 and @entity174			1
@entity1 laughs when i bring up the duo 's heart throb status , before adding ' really ? they are really considered heart throbs ? ' but @entity55 says she always enjoyed a hug with the duo			1
good friends : the trio say they have enjoyed the experience , although @entity1 says it was emotional at times terrifying : judges @entity174 and @entity171 will decide which of the three goes home the winner ' they are both , i think , so great at what they do and such enthusiasts , which is fantastically attractive , ' she admits			1
' i found them both very huggable			0
' @entity61 , meanwhile , admits to feeling a bit sorry for them			0
' all the food they eat is cold , poor guys , ' he says			2
' after it is cooked it then has to be photographed and then they have to eat each dish in turn so it is always cold			2
' so what now for our @entity209 trio ? since the show finished filming all had a complete break from cooking			1
' it was nice to just relax with some @entity216 takeaways and pizza for a week or so , ' says @entity1			1
' but now i love cooking and would love to do more of it			2
' @entity61 would quite like to incorporate it into his work as a travelogue presenter			0
' and if they wanted to offer me a cookery book for @entity225 , well i would n't say no , ' he adds			0
while for @entity55 sharing her new found knowledge will be a more private affair			1
' it has really opened my head up to really using my kitchen again and celebrating and sharing the staff of life			0
' celebrity @entity209 – the @entity4 , tonight , 8.30pm on @entity234			1
