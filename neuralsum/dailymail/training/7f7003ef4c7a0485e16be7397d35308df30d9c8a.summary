by @entity0 published : 16:50 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 01:24 est , 1 october 2013 this heart - wrenching image has captured the incredibly rare moment a mourning elephant says goodbye to her fallen friend			1
@entity7 , 63 , was on a safari trip in @entity9 with his wife @entity10 when they came across the carcass of a dead elephant surrounded by vultures and hyenas			1
as their guide called park rangers to come and remove the tusks so they would n't fall into the hands of poachers , another elephant charged over to the body			2
the female elephant scared off the animals surrounding the carcass before tenderly placing her trunk around the tusk of the dead male			1
mr @entity7 revealed how the group were then brought to tears as the female elephant stood guard over the body of her friend for several hours in what appeared to be a moving vigil			1
emotional moment : a female elephant holds on to the tusk of a fallen friend with her trunk during a moving vigil which lasted several hours at a wildlife park in @entity9			1
she had to scare off vultures and hyenas , pictured to the right of the carcass , to get to her friend 's body the amateur wildlife photographer from @entity49 said he has never witnessed anything like it in all the years he has visited @entity52 and has never seen anything like it since			1
he explained : ' we were on a game drive when the park ranger explained one elephant had migrated away from its herd so that it could die			2
this is typical of elephants when they get too old			0
' he said he had n't seen the elephant in several days when we came across the carcass of a male elephant			2
it had been there for two or three days			0
' there were about 20 vultures and 10 hyenas surrounding it but you could still clearly make out the head and tusks of the elephant			1
' the park ranger who was taking us around the reserve called for backup so that the tusks could be removed to prevent them from falling into the hands of poachers			0
' as we waited , another elephant charged out of the bush and scared off the vultures and hyenas			2
amateur wildlife photographer @entity7 , 63 , captured the emotional moment while on holiday with his wife in @entity9 ' she then tentatively wrapped her trunk around the tusk of the dead elephant in a slow and graceful movement and remained perfectly still in that position			1
' we watched her for about 20 minutes and there was n't a dry eye in the house			0
' it was an emotional sight and touching moment , watching this elephant saying goodbye to her friend , paying her respects much like we would			2
' mr @entity7 and those in his tour group continued their trip around the park before coming back to the spot where the animal carcass had been several hours later			1
to their amazement , the female elephant had remained in exactly the same position they had left her in			1
he said : ' when we came back two or three hours later she was still in exactly the same place , holding the tusk of her friend			2
' i have no idea how much longer she stayed there but it was highly unusual behaviour			0
' while this particular elephant 's behaviour is unusual , elephants are known to pay their respects to their dead			0
mr @entity7 said : ' when a herd of elephants pass a skull of a dead elephant , they have been known to pass their trunks over it as they pass			1
' he added that the obvious emotion of wild animals in @entity52 is one of the reasons he and his wife try to visit the region every two or three years			0
' you see a lot of human emotions in the magnificent animals of @entity52			0
' i think @entity52 is the last place on earth i 've seen where animals are still very much in the wild			0
' if you go to a zoo the animals are in cages and not acting normally			0
but if you go on @entity156 in a range rover in @entity52 , you 're the one in a cage and you can see the animals acting normally			0
' the picture , taken in 2007 , had to be discounted from the 2012 @entity162 photo contest because of the date it wa staken but received a special commendation			0

animal behaviour : while the female elephant 's standing vigil was incredibly rare , elephants are known to brush their trunks over the skulls of dead elephants if they pass by one			1
