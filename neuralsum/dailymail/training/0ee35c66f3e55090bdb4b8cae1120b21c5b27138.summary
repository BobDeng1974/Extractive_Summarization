a heartbreaking tale could well have a happy ending			0
a puppy , that was found by a group of workers at a construction site in @entity6 with its ears cut off , is getting used to her new life at a local veterinary facility in the province of @entity12			1
the young dog - named can - was bleeding from the head when teams from the municipal veterinary institution arrived at the scene and they immediately took it in for surgery			1
the maltreated dog was found with its ears cut off by workers on a construction site before being put in with his new friends , the puppy is allowed to take in its new environment wearing a special collar for her own protection , the extent of the puppy 's injuries is evident from a large portion of scaring on her head			1
in the video footage , she is allowed to approach some other dogs who are in a cage , prior to being fully introduced			0
just before the puppy is thrown in with new friends , she is given a friendly tickle to calm any nerves			1
and all seems well in the new dog shelter , with the puppy affectionately nuzzling her new housemate			1
to relax her before her new meeting the puppy is given a friendly tickle by the man at the sanctuary it is hoped the dog - named can - will come on leaps and bounds despite the horrific savagery ' her ears were cut from their base			1
but we have successfully conducted a plasticesthetic surgery			0
' our puppy , which we have named ' can , ' will be able to regain her health soon ' said veterinary surgeon @entity67 following the operation			2
animal rights activists have often complained about the lack of legal provisions regarding the torture of animals without owners			0
but the local veterinary department head , @entity76 , stressed that the current law does contain measures against those who cut the ears or the tail of animals			2
' unfortunately , there are people still doing it despite all the warnings and sanctions			0
this is just inhumane , ' @entity88 said			0
there are still people in @entity6 who continue to carry out ' inhumane ' acts against dogs local in @entity6 have long believed to show good care to their pets and even stray dogs and cats , but in recent months there has been a rise of violence against these animals reported			1
a woman was captured on security cameras kicking to death stray kittens and was caught in august by police in @entity107			0
another man in @entity109 was captured beating to death a stray dog			2
this has led to animal rights activists urging the government to change the legislation that labels dogs as ' goods ' rather than ' living '			0
this essentially means if something is found to have beaten , or even killed a dog , it would be classed as damaging ' property ' and could see the assailant let off with a fine .			2
