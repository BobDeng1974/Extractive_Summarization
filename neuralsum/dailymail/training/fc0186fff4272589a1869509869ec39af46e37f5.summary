the @entity26 may have supplied the blueprint , but @entity0 head coach @entity32 knows stopping @entity5 wo n’t be easy			1
‘ he ’s got a unique style , a style all of his own because he has power and he can make people miss. that combination , you can see why he ’s the leading rusher			1
just really good patience , good poise			2
’ @entity41 , who has 21 tackles and four sacks this year , called @entity5 ‘ tough to bring down ’			2
‘ the majority of the time @entity5 has great vision , great feet			1
he can make all the cuts , he can make all the moves to get back to the outside so they work well together and they get a pretty good push , ’ the defensive tackle added			2
‘ he ’s a phenomenal back , ' safety @entity52 said			2
' he ’s leading the @entity54 right now			1
we definitely have a challenge			2
we ’re gon na have to come up to the challenge and make sure that we do much better than we did last week			2
’ rookie running back @entity58 tormented the @entity60 , rushing for a career - high 154 yards and two touchdowns @entity0 defensive tackle @entity41 is all - too aware of the problems @entity5 will pose the @entity0 surrendered 191 yards to the @entity64 on only 34 rushing attempts last week , a mark @entity52 is aware they will have to improve upon			1
‘ we definitely have to clean it up			2
the longer runs that we gave up and some fundamental things like when the running back would cut back and get open			1
we do n’t want to allow any open - field or explosive runs			0
we could have played a better game in the last one , ’ the 24 - year - old said			0
@entity5 has been stellar thus far , but the @entity1 offensive line is undoubtedly one of the reasons he ’s had so much success			1
@entity32 acknowledged that if @entity27 ’ line is n’t the best @entity0 has faced , it ’s ‘ up there ’			2
he said : ‘ the offensive line is a real factor in this game			0
i think when you watch them , the athleticism they have at both tackle spots really jumps out at you			0
just the whole offensive line , that combination along with his skill set is a good match for him			0
’ @entity41 concurred , saying : ‘ it ’s going to be tough			0
they ’ve got a real good offensive line			0
they gel together well , they run the ball well			0
’ ‘ we have to make sure that we continue to stay in our gaps and get hats on them , get people to the ball and get them to the ground			0
i think it ’s going to be difficult for us but we should be able to handle it			0

he said : ‘ he has a great offensive line , big guys			0
they ’re going to run it , especially with @entity20 possibly being out			0
the way to defend him is not let him get outside			0
you have to keep him contained in the interior and hit his legs			0
you do n’t want him high too much because he gets stronger as the game goes on			0
’ whether @entity20 plays or not , @entity0 will have to bottle @entity5 up early and shut him down late if they want to emerge with a big w against @entity1			1
