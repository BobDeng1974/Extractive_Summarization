by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 11:15 est , 28 september 2012 a woman deputy head who with a teaching assistant lifted a six - year - old boy by the armpits and carried him into school was banned from teaching by the teacher 's watchdog			1
@entity9 , 51 , of @entity10 in @entity11 , used ' inappropriate force ' after she tackled the pupil who refused to return to class and wanted to lie face down in the sun instead			1
mrs @entity9 who taught at the @entity18 primary school in @entity19 said she had acted because she feared for the boy 's safety when he refused to budge			1
banned : former deputy head @entity9 ' roughly ' dragged boy back to class she claimed the school was short staffed , drug users hung about the area and there was a danger of abduction			1
but @entity31 footage captured part of the incident in june 2010 which showed the boy being dragged			1
following the incident she was sacked by the school but an the eve of an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal last march she reached a cash settlement with the local authority			2
at the time her solicitor said she 'd suffered ' a grave injustice			2
' the professional conduct committee of the @entity43 decided her actions amounted to unacceptable professional conduct			2
@entity46 , who presented the case to the committee , said mrs @entity9 was the behavioural co-ordinator at the school and should have set an example			2
she said : ' she has not shown insight or expressed regret			2
' the panel ruled mrs @entity9 could only return to the classroom after a six month suspension and she has satisfactorily completed courses in ' challenging behaviour and physical intervention			2
' @entity19 primary school where deputy head @entity9 taught at chairwoman @entity60 said that there had been ' other options ' than manhandling the boy			1
mrs @entity9 should have got another member of staff to sit with the boy known as @entity66 as she knew his mother had been contacted			1
she said : ' she has shown insufficient insight into the seriousness of the incident or the inappropriateness of her intervention having regard to the needs of the pupil			0
' it was also ruled she had failed to report the incident to the head when he returned from a course , not made a note of the incident , ignored @entity82 ' intervention ' guidelines and had involved the teaching assistant in a disciplinary offence			0
school staff have legal powers to use ' reasonable ' force to stop pupils from committing crimes , injuring themselves or others , and damaging property			0
guidelines say that force should only be used as a last resort and schools are urged not to have a ' no contact ' policy as it could prevent a teacher from acting			0
one way for teachers to intervene is to act as a block between pupils or stand in their way			0
in instances where there is need for more control , they can lead a pupil by the hand or arm or ushering them away by placing a hand in the centre of their back			1
in extreme circumstances such as fighting , self defence and attacks on other teachers , they may also use restraint			0
the committee also took into account 18 months after the complaint was made and while on anti-depressants she was involved in a car crash when three times over the drink - drive limit			0
she was subsequently convicted of drink driving			0
mrs @entity132 did not attended the hearing at @entity134 in @entity135 but said she was now teetotal and her overriding concern had been for the boy 's welfare			1
she denied she caused any physically or emotionally abuse to the boy			1
but @entity140 , headmaster of the 260 - pupil school , told the hearing child protection training made it clear that they must not have gratuitous physical contact with young children , only to prevent real risk and immediate harm			0
he was shown the @entity31 footage after he returned which he said depicted the dragging of a small child and looked to him like inappropriate behaviour			1
after showing the film to the governors ' chairman , social services were contacted and a ' child protection ' investigation was launched			0
when asked what mrs @entity9 should have done , he said she and the assistant should have sat down next to the child and chatted			0
if that failed either the parents or grandparents , both of whom lived within 100 yards of the school , should have been called			1
police took no action over the incident .			0

@entity172 , 6 , was ' roughly ' picked up by armpits when he refused to get off the *floor* and come inside
@entity31 showed boy being dragged back to class
boy 's parents who lived only 100 yards away should have been called to deal with him
