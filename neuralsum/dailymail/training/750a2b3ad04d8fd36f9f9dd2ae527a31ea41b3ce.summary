by @entity1 - squire when his parents built a play pirate ship in his back garden , four - year - old @entity2 was thrilled			1
the wooden ship , crafted from recycled timber , became his pride and joy and the ‘ labour of love ’ was admired by everyone who saw it			2
but then a neighbour complained to the council that @entity2 was invading their privacy , claiming he could spy on them over the fence			1
@entity29 has ordered mum and dad @entity32 and @entity33 to either dismantle the ship or apply for retrospective planning permission – because the structure has ‘ raised platforms ’ more than 12 inches ( 30cm ) high			1
last night mr @entity2 , 46 , a company director , said : ‘ the thought of having to dismantle @entity2 ’s ship is devastating			1
he loves it and that would break his heart			0
’ the couple , from @entity45 , @entity46 , began building the ship , which also incorporates a wheel , slide , dens and two sets of stairs in may			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ @entity2 has always loved pirates and it promised to be a lovely family project – something the three of us could enjoy doing together			2
‘ when we told him we were going to build a ship he was so excited			2
it took us three - and - a - half weeks to construct and we made it up as we went along			0
it was a labour of love and we were so proud of it			0
’ but three weeks after the project was finished , they received a letter from the council			0
‘ the end of the garden where we built the pirate ship is surrounded by five neighbours and sadly one of them said @entity2 could spy on them , ’ said mr @entity2			1
‘ it seemed ridiculous to be worrying about one little boy who only plays on it for a few minutes at a time , and the area is already well screened by trees			0
’ @entity2 , with parents , @entity32 and @entity33 , may soon be without his pirate ship after complaints from neighbours keen not to fall out with their neighbours , the @entity85 erected a solid bamboo fence			1
but despite this , the council still said the ship needed full planning permission			1
the @entity85 have since liaised with the local authority which says one way to comply with regulations would be to remove parts that are too high			0
but , the couple claims this would mean demolishing the wheel , slide and two sets of stairs			0
‘ it would ruin @entity2 ’s fun because it would no longer be a ship , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
they now propose to put in the planning application , which will cost £ 212			0
mrs @entity106 , 36 , said : ‘ it seems ludicrous we have to pay for this application , as the council has already indicated it is likely to be refused			0
but we do n’t know how we would tell @entity2 his ship has to be dismantled			1
so if it is refused then we will appeal			0
’ a spokesman for @entity29 said : ‘ we received a complaint about the effect on neighbours ’ privacy and so were obliged to investigate			2

a neighbour complained to the council that four - year - old @entity2 was invading their privacy
it came after his parents built a play pirate ship for him in their back garden
but neighbours said @entity2 could spy on them over the fence
despite his parents putting up bamboo screen , the ship could be demolished
to stop that , his parents will have to apply for further planning permission
