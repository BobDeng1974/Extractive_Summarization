pictured , right : the couple on their wedding day in 1970 the decision was appealed and it is currently being considered by the @entity27 , who have told the couple that no final ruling will be made until the end of may			1
the couple , who own a house in @entity33 , are meanwhile desperately trying to prove that their marriage is genuine for fear mrs @entity17 could be permanently excluded from the @entity4 when her temporary tourist visa expires			1
mrs @entity17 said : ' it 's ridiculous , we are quite willing to give the border people what they want but they are adamant			2
i do n't know what they want us to prove			0
' anyone who has ever spoken to us can clearly see that we are best friends and have been since the day we met			0
' we 've got almost half a century 's worth of birthday cards , 45 years of holiday snaps from all ove the world			0
' we 've got pictures of us with our son just after he was born , growing up , right up to his wedding day			2
if they 'd asked us to send us all of those photos , we could have done			0
' mr @entity7 , a retired retailer and published author , added : ' why pick on us ? we 've been married for 45 years and we are completely devoted to one another , what do they want us to do ? ' we could show them pictures , e-mails , texts , everything from our marriage , but they have not asked us for anything			0
they are doing this based on no evidence at all			0
' the couple say they have five decades ' worth of pictures to prove their long - running marriage is genuine - but were not asked to provide any evidence when applying for the visa mr @entity7 said : ' we love each other very much , it 's hurtful for them to suggest our marriage is not real ' mr @entity7 added : ' they have n't even given us a chance to prove that our marriage is real			1
we 've got a marriage certificate and a son , what more do they want ? ' we love each other very much , it 's really hurtful for them to suggest that our marriage is not real			0
' mrs @entity17 's application for a permanent @entity4 visa was rejected by @entity4 authorities , with a letter citing the reason for rejection stating : ' you have not provided any evidence that your relationship is still subsisting			2
' it is reasonable to expect that in a genuine subsisting , supportive and affectionate relationship , there would be evidence of regular contact , signs of companionship , emotional support , affection , and abiding interest in each other 's welfare and well - being throughout the entire duration of your relationship ...			0
i am therefore not satisfied that your relationship is not genuine			0
' the pair met at a dance in @entity117 , @entity12 in 1966 while mr @entity7 was in the country working in retail and soon fell in love			2
mr and mrs @entity17 lived in @entity2 after they married in 1970			1
they want to move to the house they own in @entity33 so they can look after mr @entity7 's mother they say the decision has been made all the more extraordinary by the fact that they have grown - up son they married in 1970 and lived in @entity117 until 1981 , when they moved to @entity134			1
the couple made frequent visits back to the @entity4 and bought their house in @entity33 in 1995 for mr @entity7 's elderly mother @entity138 to live in			1
they made the trip back in september 2013 and intended to retire in @entity33 and care for @entity138 , who had fallen ill. @entity7 said : ' we filled in a load of forms when we had @entity9 which meant we could come back and forth as much as we wanted , but for us to retire here permanently , we found out @entity8 needed to have this pemanent visa			0
' if @entity8 's second visa application fails , we would have no choice but to move back to @entity2			2
' we would have to sell our home and move my mother into a care home			0
we have family here but they can not look after her			0
' i find it utterly extraordinary , i ca n't really contemplate life without my wife			1
' the @entity160 , which runs the @entity27 , has yet to comment on the case			0
mrs @entity17 now has to wait until may for her appeal to be finalised , but she fears she and her husband may have to move back to @entity2 if she is not allowed to stay			2
