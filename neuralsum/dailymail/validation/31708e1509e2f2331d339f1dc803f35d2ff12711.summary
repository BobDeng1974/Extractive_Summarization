it 's becoming as regular as clockwork at @entity2 : a @entity4 contract saga			1
just over two years after signing a £ 90,000 - per - week deal , the winger 's future is again in the spotlight			1
as @entity10 so jovially put it last week , contact has been made with ' the embassy ' ( @entity4 's representatives ) about a contract extension			1
@entity2 forward @entity4 comes on from the bench against @entity15 , is now not a guaranteed starter but just like two years ago , there are no guarantees @entity4 will commit			1
perhaps , even more so this time			0
ever since recovering from a serious knee injury that kept him out for the majority of last year , @entity4 has been on the peripheries			1
@entity4 was flying before injuring his anterior cruciate ligament against @entity23 last january			1
he 'd established himself as an integral member of @entity10 's first - team plans			0
@entity4 sprints away in celebration having scored against @entity27 during the 2 - 1 victory last month @entity4 wants a significant pay rise if he is to sign a new @entity2 contract since then , though , the landscape at @entity2 has changed			1
@entity32 has arrived , so to has @entity33			0
@entity4 is no longer indispensable			2
in addition to @entity32 and @entity33 , there is @entity36 and @entity37 to contend with			0
@entity4 no longer walks into this team			2
so , with that in mind , does he warrant a pay - rise ? that 's the question @entity2 's moneymen will be asking themselves over the coming weeks			1
because that 's what he wants ; a hefty hike on his current £ 4.6million - per - year deal			1
can you justify paying someone in excess of £ 100,000 - per - week who is n't a first - choice option for the manager ? the @entity54 international gestures at @entity23 fans after injuring his anterior cruciate ligament last year the @entity2 hierarchy are likely to argue not			1
and all that points to one thing : another @entity4 contract row			2
you can understand where @entity4 's representatives are coming from			2
at the age of 26 , this could be his last big contract			0
his advisors have a duty to secure the best possible deal for their client			0
there will certainly be takers for @entity4 if he leaves this summer			2
@entity71 and @entity72 are both monitoring the situation closely			0
the fact he has pace and is @entity76 ( helping homegrown quotas ) means he will be a valuable commodity if he 's made available for transfer			0
@entity4 has faced increased competition for a starting place in the @entity2 attack this season as for @entity2 , they have four options			1
the first is to meet his demands , the second is to try to reach a compromise			0
the third is to let him enter the final year of his contract , which opens the door to @entity4 leaving for nothing next year			1
@entity91 is to sell him this summer			0
it 's a game of poker			0
we 're waiting to see who 'll blink first			0
@entity4 will be hoping to earn a similar amount to @entity97 star man @entity32 on £ 140,000 - per - week @entity4 looked certain to leave the @entity98 in 2012 after rejecting a new contract			1
@entity10 managed to persuade the speedster to stay and his subsequent performances led to the @entity97 improving their offer , which was signed in january 2013			0
there will be a similar incentive for @entity4 this time , too			2
but will he spend enough time on the pitch to make a similar impression ? things change			0
maybe it 's time for @entity4 to make a change , too .			2

@entity4 is currently earning around £ 90,000 - per - week , £ 4.6m a year
@entity4 is holding out for an @entity2 pay rise before signing new deal
@entity54 international hoping for sum north of £ 100,000 - per - week
