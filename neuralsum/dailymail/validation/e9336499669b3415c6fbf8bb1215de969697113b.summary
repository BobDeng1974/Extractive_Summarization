@entity1 's 4 - 3 loss to @entity2 has prompted further calls for change in the @entity6 capital			1
they progressed to the quarter - finals of the @entity9 thanks to a 2 - 0 win in the first leg , but tuesday night was supposed to be easy			1
on sunday , their place at the top of @entity15 was swiped from underneath them , and 92 % of fans have demanded a change in tactical approach , according to a recent poll in @entity21			0
most players have been criticised - @entity23 included - but perhaps most under - fire is @entity25			1
mr @entity1 , with over 500 appearances			1
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity25 has come under heavy scrutiny after a series of poor performances @entity32 goalkeeper @entity31 has been touted as the perfect replacement at @entity1 three of @entity2 's four goals could have been saved , they said			1
@entity25 needs to leave , they said			1
at 33 years of age , he may well be past his best , with three @entity39 , five league titles and one @entity41 tucked safely under his belt			0
@entity32 's @entity31 has been touted as his possible replacement , and even @entity45 's @entity44 waded into the debate on tuesday night			1
' @entity1 need a new keeper			2
@entity31 wants to win trophies			2
no brainer , ' he wrote on @entity50			0
@entity31 was labelled the best goalkeeper in the world by @entity53 this week , and may leave @entity32 @entity54 is also waiting for his chance at the @entity56 after joining in the summer and perhaps he has a point			2
@entity32 have fallen short of expectations once more , and @entity31 will be keen to taste success ... where better than the city he was born ? he is a @entity62 international , and certainly talented enough to take the reins from his countryman			2
but you get the feeling that @entity1 would not be the same without @entity25			1
since 1999 , he has been a main - stay at the @entity56			2
at the end of the game on tuesday night , there was an endearing moment in which he refused to let his team - mates leave the pitch before thanking the @entity1 fans			1
@entity25 would not let his team - mates leave the pitch on tuesday night before they thanked the supporters @entity23 was unhappy at his side 's performance , but was made to applaud the fans by @entity25 pointing and pulling , ushering his team - mates to the corners of the pitch to applaud the supporters			1
but still they want rid			0
for the first goal , he palmed the ball into his bottom corner			0
for the second , he pushed it into the path of @entity92			0
for the third , he was rooted to the spot			0
success is in @entity1 's nature , and their fans are n't happy with the amount of goals they are conceding			1
that starts at the back ... with @entity25			2
aside from @entity31 's potential arrival , you ca n't forget the presence of @entity54			2
signed from @entity106 in the summer , he is waiting , willing , wishing for his chance			0
@entity31 is a @entity62 international and grew up in @entity1 , playing for @entity109 before moving to @entity32 @entity25 has had a remarkable career , winning numerous trophies including the 2010 @entity41 but @entity31 makes sense			1
he is 24 years old , and getting better with every game he plays			0
signed by sir @entity114 for just shy of Â£ 19million in 2011 , @entity32 would make a tidy profit on him if he were to leave			0
' i think @entity31 is the best goalkeeper in the world at the moment , ' @entity53 told @entity119 after monday night 's @entity121 clash with @entity122			0
the best goalkeeper in the world to one of the best football clubs in the world			0
maybe @entity44 has called it right again .			0
