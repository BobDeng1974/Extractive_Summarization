on september 18 , date of the @entity2 referendum , something infinitely less seismic is happening that is nonetheless of quiet importance to the parish of @entity8 tennis			1
as @entity2 residents cast their votes , the draw for next year 's @entity10 will take place and , for the domestic game and its key player @entity16 , those two things could be very much interlinked			1
in response to a question about the @entity19 said last week that , in the event of the @entity23 vote , he ' assumed ' he would be playing for @entity2 , but a deeper look into the matter shows it may be less straightforward than anyone – including @entity16 himself – might think			1
@entity27 : @entity16 has an impressive @entity10 record for @entity29 , winning 19 of his 21 singles matches in fact , such are the uncertainties that tennis and other sports are trying to grapple with , that one many eventual scenarios if separation happens could even be that he continues to play for gb in the @entity10 while turning out for @entity2 in @entity19			1
such is the confusion associated with the increasingly likely outcome of a yes vote that , in tennis , it has become the subject that nobody wants to talk about			2
@entity16 's endorsement may be the glittering prize for either side of the independence argument but , understandably in some ways , he continues to tiptoe around it as the implications are considerable for the reigning @entity52			1
it is not just him anxious to avoid discussion			2
@entity56 chief executive @entity55 is another to have stayed determinedly uncommitted on the issue			2
@entity58 are desperate to remain neutral , despite it being massively important to the future of the game north of the border			2
broader governing body @entity62 restricts itself to setting out procedural elements in the event of a @entity23 vote			1
option ? @entity10 captain @entity67 ( right ) might not be able to pick @entity16 for his side in the future part of the reason is that there would be no meaningful precedent if @entity2 breaks away			1
according to one official , the only comparable scenario is the recent secession of @entity77 from @entity77 ( the former @entity78 is not an equivalent as , unlike @entity27 , it ceased to exist )			0
while @entity77 does have a national tennis association , and competed in the @entity10 up to 2001 , war - torn @entity77 has got infinitely more important things to consider than setting up sporting administrations in the new country			1
in the @entity8 tennis , a completely integrated sport with no meaningful history of @entity2 competing separately , is an interesting study of the difficulties and fears affecting sports north of the border with the possibility of independence , especially those that supply @entity96 teams			1
@entity2 is affiliated to the @entity56 in the same way that , say , @entity98 or @entity99 are , and @entity58 receives a basic grant of £ 800,000 annually from the centre plus support for athletes and facilities			1
the @entity106 white paper is thin on detail about how and when this kind of money would be replaced			0
in the seductive @entity112 utopia promised by the @entity113 , in which public spending will go up while things like corporation tax goes down , there are assurances that funding levels for world class sport will survive a schism with the south			2
big question : @entity56 chief executive @entity55 must formulate a plan to find the next @entity16 @entity124 , chief executive of @entity58 , is among those reluctant to be drawn about the myriad implications , but admitted ' the honest position just now is that there will be a lot of negotiations and decisions in the event of a yes vote that are impossible to predict , and sport is unlikely to be at the top of the pile			1
' there are a lot of unknowns which make it impossible to have a clear idea of what is going to happen			0
it seems a waste of money to get legal advice about what could be when there are so many unknowns in the situation			0
it will be different for each sport			0
' one possible outcome that has been discussed among various @entity96 sport is that what may emerge for some is a compromise along the lines of what happens for some sports in @entity161 , which have remained united even though @entity162 is a separate sovereign nation			0
gold : the @entity165 represented @entity27 at the @entity166 , winning a @entity164 and silver medal some governing bodies are extremely sceptical about whether legal and constitutional issues could be solved in time to allow a separate @entity2 to compete at @entity170 , something that would affect the ex @entity173 champion among others			1
sir @entity176 , vice-president of the @entity177 , is the latest to point this out			0
a tennis team is logistically far easier to organise than , say , rowing or sailing			0
yet an idea of how complex @entity96 entry could be in the case of tennis comes with the dry - as - dust response of a spokesperson for the @entity188 ( which runs the sport at the @entity96 ) to inquiries about how an independent @entity2 would proceed after a theoretical split from the @entity56			2
here goes : ' in order to take part in any @entity188 team competition a nation has to be a ' @entity197 ' member			0
a @entity198 may apply for membership of the @entity188 in accordance with the @entity201			0
in order to apply for membership a @entity202 must first be a member of the @entity206 ( a low profile body called @entity208 in @entity2 's case ) and in the case of @entity197 members , a member of the @entity211 or a member state of the @entity213			2
all memberships must be approved at the @entity217			0
' doubles triumph : @entity16 teamed up with @entity219 to win @entity220 in the mixed doubles at @entity166 to summarise , that suggests a tricky number of hurdles would need to be cleared in a short period for @entity96 participation , at a time when sport would hardly be at the top of a new @entity2 government 's in - tray with so many more important matters to be sorted out			1
it is also @entity188 policy that a player can represent who he or she wants providing they have the requisite passport from that nation – and who gets to hold which passport will be among the thorniest issues to sort out in the event of a @entity23 vote			1
you can see why highly focussed athletes do not want to get involved in this kind of minutiae , and also why potential @entity250 north of the border might be concerned , given all the possible outcomes and funding implications			2
it is also easy to understand why @entity16 , his family and the likes of close friend sir @entity257 are very keen not to become embroiled in a campaign getting more heated and unpleasant the nearer polling day comes			1
they are part of what might be termed the fearful undeclared			0
if they were to come out on the no side they will be subject to the vicious attacks of the ' @entity268 ' and other pro-independence supporters			0
if they were to express a view in favour of a @entity23 vote it would open them up to charges of being anti-english , and doubtless unsettle commercial sponsors as well			1
this is a particularly sensitive time for the former @entity173 champion in that regard , as his main apparel contract with adidas is due for renewal on january 1			0
negotiations are ongoing with them and others who might wish to sign him with its worth likely to be in the region of £ 3 million per year , give or take performance clauses			0
breakthrough : the @entity165 's straight sets win over @entity293 handed @entity16 the 2012 @entity294 the @entity173 champion has reason to be particularly cautious , given the hysterical reaction to some harmless joshing with his friend @entity299 about supporting football teams eight years ago that is still held against him by some to this day			1
the day after his triumph as @entity304 last year , when he would have been feeling indestructible , @entity16 declared that he would have to say something on independence			1
he has subsequently thought better of it , given the highly emotive reactions the subject draws , but anyone who knows him will be sure that he will have a view , given his intellectual curiosity and fondness for a debate about most things			0
the nearest he has come to publicly expressing a view was in march last year , when he said in an interview with the @entity319 magazine : ' i do n't think you should judge the thing on emotion , but on what is best economically for @entity2			2
you do n't want to come to a snap decision and then see the country go tits up			0
' i am proud to be @entity2 , but i am also proud to be @entity8			2
i do n't think there is any contradiction in that			0
' passionate : @entity331 and @entity332 celebrate @entity16 winning @entity173 in 2013 more recently he has pointed out that his view has little relevance because , as a longstanding resident of @entity336 , he does not have a vote			1
but there have been hints of his thinking , such as criticising @entity332 for unfurling a @entity341 in @entity173 's @entity342 last year			0
in the past expressed his admiration for staunch ' @entity346 ' supporter @entity345 , and does not give the impression of being a great enthusiast for independence			0
his private and professional connections make a nonsense of any suggestions that he is in some way anti-english , and he has never shied from wrapping himself in the @entity354 or made a secret of his pride in representing @entity29			2
patriotic : @entity16 returned to his hometwon @entity358 after his successes at the @entity166 it was notable that after @entity166 he declined to appear at the parade of @entity2 olympians in @entity363 but made his own personal visit to his hometown of @entity358			1
yet it should be stressed that none of the country 's first tennis family have publicly made their views clear , including brother @entity372 and mother @entity373			0
in the case of the latter , who is captain of @entity29 's @entity379 team , a few clues can be gleaned from her highly active @entity381 feed			2
she used to follow the @entity113 account , although stopped doing that prior to getting the @entity27 job			0
last week she retweeted a picture of her holding a @entity341 - patterned fan that was accompanied by a ( lighthearted ) suggestion that she was a fan of independence			0
like everything else connected with this very complex issue , it will all most likely become clearer after september 18 , although perhaps not for some considerable time , possibly not for years			1
decisions : @entity16 's mother @entity397 ( centre ) is the captain of the @entity400 team			1

@entity2 referendum takes place on september 18
