by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 02:53 est , 6 july 2012 someone in the @entity5 house conducted several suicide - related searches on the family computer , including ‘ fool - proof suffocation ’ and ‘ venturing into the pro-suicide pit ’ on the day little @entity2 vanished , @entity2 ’s defence attorney @entity1 said			1
the attorney revealed in his book entitled @entity12 , @entity2 : the @entity14 , that the searches were conducted around an hour after @entity16 ’s father @entity5 said she left the home			1
while last year ’s trial famously revealed that the family computer also had searches for ‘ chloroform , ’ the suicide searches were not revealed , @entity1 said , because they were discovered after the fact			1
@entity2 's defense attorney : @entity1 gestures as he speaks about his just - published book @entity12 , @entity2 : the @entity14 almost a year to the day she was acquitted one year on : @entity16 was sensationally acquitted by a jury last july 5 , left , and walked free from jail just over a week later , right he told @entity29 : ‘ i have a hard time believing that law enforcement would n’t check the internet history of the day that the child went missing			1
that would have been bombshell evidence in the trial if it had come out			0
’ @entity1 , @entity2 's defense lawyer , has written a tell - all book about the case prosecutors claimed @entity5 suffocated @entity2 with duct tape so she could spend time with her boyfriend and be free for @entity44 's nightlife			1
@entity1 said during the trial - repeated again in his book - that @entity2 accidentally drowned in a family swimming pool and that her father , @entity5 , hid the body			1
@entity1 also claimed @entity5 sexually abused his daughter			1
@entity5 denied both allegations , and there was little brought up about them during the trial			0
@entity1 said the defence was n't required to put on any such evidence because proving the case is the prosecution 's burden , not the other way around			1
@entity5 tried to commit suicide in january 2009 , and was found in a @entity63 hotel after overdosing on prescription drugs			2
a five - page suicide note was also discovered at the hotel			0
@entity1 told @entity29 that it was hard to determine who in the @entity67 conducted what searches on january 16 , 2008 , but said it was possible to infer who searched what , based on the terms searched			2
for instance , one of the terms searched was ‘ foolproof suffocation			0
’ @entity1 noted that the terms were spelled incorrectly , and that @entity5 struggled with good spelling			2
he wrote in his book : ‘ by looking at the websites being researched , all concerned with suicide and death , it certainly appears that the one who felt the blame was a guilt - ridden @entity5			1
’ evidence and testimony showed that @entity5 was a habitual liar , even making up fake friends and pretending every day to go to a job she did n't have			0
@entity1 was asked whether @entity5 's lies surrounding her daughter 's disappearance might be indicative that she was guilty			1
troubled : @entity16 's father , @entity5 , seen in court last june , attempted suicide in 2009 ; @entity1 pontificates that the suicide searches could have been his counsel : defence attorney @entity1 talks to @entity2 during her trial when the jury heard her father say her car smelled of human decomposition			1
@entity1 revealed in his book he also thought he could smell a dead body innocent : mystery surrounds the cause of @entity2 's death after her mother was acquitted of her murder one year ago today ' i do n't think the lies are indicative of innocence or guilt , ' he said			1
' the lies were there long before @entity2 passed away			0
' in the book , he says @entity5 had built a ' fantasy world , ' and her lies were n't evidence of guilt but signs of someone with ' serious mental health issues			2
' @entity1 said one piece of prosecution evidence he was most concerned about was that police cadaver dogs had indicated a body may have been in the trunk of @entity5 's car at one point and also that a body may have been in the backyard			1
none was discovered in the backyard and there was nothing but rotting bags of trash in the trunk			0
but , he said , people - and jurors - believe in dogs			0
' that concerned me a little bit			0
most people really think dogs can do magic , ' @entity1 said			0
he also strongly considered early in the case whether she should plead guilty to a lesser charge to avoid the death penalty if convicted of murdering her two - year - old daughter @entity2 , but @entity5 adamantly insisted she had nothing to do with the toddler 's death			1
new look : the last time the public saw @entity16 was when this video was released in october			0
she is said to be living in @entity169 , @entity170 ' found ' : @entity171 , @entity170 , where @entity2 is reported to be staying with a friend @entity1 said prosecutors offered in 2008 to allow @entity5 to plead guilty to aggravated manslaughter of a child and serve up to 13 years in prison			1
he said that in those early days he thought taking it might be in @entity5 's best interest			2
' there were times , difficult times , when the evidence did n't look good for @entity16 , ' @entity1 said , adding that it was his obligation as a lawyer to convey any such plea offers			0
the prosecution 's flaw , he added , was that regarding the car search the dog and handler were focused only on @entity5 's vehicle and did not include others in a lineup to give the dog options			2
overall , @entity1 attributed the strong public backlash against the jury 's verdict to a lack of understanding about the judicial system and because ' a lot of people bought into the hype ' that @entity5 must have been guilty			1
he noted that jurors who gave media interviews after the trial said they waited for weeks for strong evidence that never came			0
' we need to talk about whether an actual murder occurred , ' he said			0
' that 's where the focus should have been , and it never was			0
' @entity1 declined to comment on what @entity5 is doing these days and on how often he talks to her			2
he said he promised her confidentiality when she agreed that he could write his book , in which she did not participate			0
@entity5 is living in an undisclosed location in @entity170 serving probation for an unrelated conviction , which @entity1 said ends on august 21			2
parents : @entity5 and @entity2 both lied to cover up what really happened to @entity2 , claims @entity1 ' she 's doing a lot better than she was in prison , ' @entity1 said , but then added : ' she 's a prisoner of her own freedom			1
' @entity5 , he said , ' would not entertain it for a second '			0
as he became more familiar with the state 's mostly circumstantial case , @entity1 said he grew convinced she would be acquitted by a jury – as she was a year ago today of all charges except for four misdemeanors of lying to investigators			1
' there was nothing in the trial that ever made me think @entity16 was guilty of anything as related to the murder , ' @entity1 said			0
' every single piece of evidence favored us			0
' in his book , @entity1 also lashes out at several entities - calling the media a ' monster ' , the police ' careless ' and the prosecution ' scheming and ruthless '			2
he wrote : ' this was not real life , it was the media 's @entity2 reality show , a show that depended on name - calling and controversy for television ratings			2
' he told @entity262 ' @entity261 : ' i think @entity2 's story , the whole case , was a media phenomenon			1
and i say that because she was young , pretty and white			0
' if it did n't have those elements to it i do n't think it would have taken off			0
' prosecutors claimed @entity5 suffocated @entity2 with duct tape so she could spend time with her boyfriend and be free for @entity44 's nightlife .			1

former defence attorney @entity1 reveals in new book that there were also suicide searches on @entity5 family computer
he speculates they could have been from @entity2 's father @entity5
on july 5 , 2011 , a jury sensationally acquitted @entity5 of all three charges which together carried the death penalty
