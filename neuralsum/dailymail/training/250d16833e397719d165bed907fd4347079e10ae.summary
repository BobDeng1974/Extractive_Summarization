cross-party anger at @entity3 ’s ‘ zombie @entity1 ’ was last night raging amid claims the @entity5 has virtually nothing to do before the @entity7			1
mps vented their fury at @entity10 for insisting on a fixed , five - year parliament when they ran out of ideas ‘ six months ago ’			1
@entity13 said there was now so little legislation to discuss that @entity17 backbenchers were only expected to turn up at @entity3 for barely a month between now and the election on may 7			2
@entity8 have vented their fury at @entity10 for insisting on a fixed , five - year parliament amid claims the @entity5 has virtually no legislation to discuss before the @entity7			1
even conservative mps are concerned			0
@entity17 mp @entity23 , chairman of the @entity24 , said : ‘ there ’s a natural rhythm to @entity28 politics that has served us well for decades and it ’s a four - year rhythm			1
i ’d prefer to do away with the whole idea of fixed terms			2
’ in a controversial move after the last general election , the @entity17 / @entity33 pushed through a new law that parliaments must last a full five years except in exceptional circumstances			1
this was seen as an attempt by @entity41 and @entity42 to prevent rebel mps voting with @entity13 to boot the fragile @entity33 out of office			1
but mps across the political divide are now complaining that the fifth year has become one long ‘ anteroom ’ to the election – with the @entity5 all but devoid of serious @entity50 business to discuss			1
in an article for @entity52 ( see below ) shadow cabinet office minister @entity53 said the @entity33 was presiding over a zombie @entity1 with little sign of @entity50 activity			1
@entity17 mps , he said , had effectively been told to turn up for only 33 days between now and when @entity1 is dissolved for the election			1
the fixed - term parliament law was pushed through by the @entity33 after they came into power in 2010 mr @entity53 stopped short of saying that a @entity13 government would scrap the five - year rule			1
but two other senior shadow ministers privately said that @entity1 should sit for four years at most			1
@entity64 mp @entity63 called for a return to the rule where prime ministers were able to name the date of the election , but no @entity1 could sit for more than five years			2
the current situation at @entity3 had led to a ‘ paralysis of power ’ , he said			0
no 10 last night denied the @entity33 had run out of steam , saying it was making ‘ good progress ’ with its legislative programme of 18 @entity75 this parliamentary session			2
shadow minister @entity53 said the @entity33 was presiding over a zombie @entity1 for the past two weeks or so , barely a mouse has stirred in the @entity3			1
apart from the traditional @entity82 on the @entity5 ’ terrace , the grand old building has been silent			2
which is how it should be			0
even mps and peers like to celebrate @entity87 with their families , away from the normal @entity90 knockabout of @entity3 politics – especially with a general election looming			2
but with the @entity5 back to work tomorrow , you ’d expect that there would be hardly so much as a day off between now and that appointment with the voters on may 7			2
after all , we ’ve just had two weeks off to recharge the batteries			0
surely now it ’ll be full steam ahead , the place fizzing as @entity41 strains every sinew on every available day to get vital legislation through before @entity1 breaks for the election			0
how wrong you ’d be			0
a glance at the official parliamentary calendar , set by the @entity33 parties , reveals that there will , in fact , be many more days when the @entity5 is as quiet as @entity87 – only this time without any justification			1
with 122 days to go before polling day , mps are scheduled to be sat on the famous commons ’ green benches for way under half that : a grand total of 49 days			1
in practice , it ’ll be even fewer after the inevitable extra breaks are added in at the last minute			0
why ? because the @entity17 / @entity33 ran out of ideas months ago			2
the paltry number of sitting days actually tells only half the story			0
even when mps are physically at @entity3 , there is precious little to do – aside from the work of backbench mps or motions put forward by the @entity13 opposition			0
official parliamentary records show that in the year or so up to june 2014 , we had the lowest number of @entity75 since 1950			0
with 122 days to go before polling day , mps are scheduled to attend @entity3 for just 49 days since last summer , there ’ve been even fewer signs of activity from the @entity50 benches – so few that @entity17 chief whip @entity138 recently told his mps not to bother coming in on thursdays in future			1
take those out , and the fridays they inevitably take off as well , and it wo n’t be @entity5 ’ days left for many @entity17 but 33 at best before @entity1 is dissolved at the end of march			1
ministers may dismiss these criticisms as just partisan point - scoring from a @entity13 mp against a @entity17 - led government			0
even many conservatives are privately embarrassed at how little they have to do at @entity3			0
there are major national and global challenges that the government should be addressing – assisted and enabled by parliamentary scrutiny			0
yes , there ’s an election coming and mps of all colours will be itching to get out there campaigning			0
but i , like so many of my fellow mps , want to be part of an active , vibrant democratic process not a @entity1 that just goes through the motions of being the cockpit of the nation			0
@entity53 is @entity13 mp for @entity167 .			0
