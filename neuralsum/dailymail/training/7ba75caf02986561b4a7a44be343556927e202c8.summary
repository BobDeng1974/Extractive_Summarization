by @entity0 up to 70,000 @entity2 and @entity3 will travel to @entity4 each year when they finally gain open access to the jobs market , a report claims today			1
almost 29million people from the two countries will be free to work in @entity4 from the end of this year when temporary controls on new @entity12 migrants expire			2
but although ministers have their own estimate of the scale of the influx , they refuse to reveal it			0
the figure is likely to be the crucial factor in deciding whether the government will hit the prime minister ’s goal of cutting net migration – the difference between those arriving and leaving each year – to ‘ tens of thousands ’ a @entity27 community in @entity2			1
both @entity2 and @entity3 are relatively poor , rendering employment in the @entity4 an attractive prospect the report by the pressure group @entity31 says @entity3 and @entity2 will add between 30,000 and 70,000 to our population in each of the next five years			1
this is partly based on the events of 2004 when immigration soared after @entity37 and seven other nations joined the @entity12			2
the report estimates an average of 50,000 @entity3 and @entity2 will arrive here each year , a total of 250,000			1
but it warns the figure could soar if @entity27 gipsies or the nearly 1million @entity3 already in other @entity12 countries also come			1
@entity3 and @entity2 joined the @entity12 in 2007 , but the number who could take jobs here was capped at 25,000 for low - skilled workers			1
that limit expires this year			2

both are relatively poor with a minimum wage of around £ 1 an hour , compared to £ 6.19 here , and income per head of about a fifth of @entity4 ’s			0
in addition , destinations such as @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 have high youth unemployment			0
the @entity4 also offers full benefits when immigrants find work , including housing and child benefit and child tax credit			2
@entity31 chairman sir @entity74 said : ‘ it is not good enough to duck making an estimate of immigration			0
it is likely to have significant consequences for housing and services			0
it will also add to the competition young workers face			0
’ @entity86 indicated he did not have confidence in @entity89 figures , saying the estimated influx of around 14,000 @entity37 in 2004 turned out to be ‘ ridiculously low ’			0
the @entity91 said it was looking at ‘ factors that may encourage @entity12 nationals to come to the @entity4 ’ .			0

migration *watchdog* says workers will be attracted by higher wages and benefits
cap on @entity3 and @entity2 is set to expire this year
