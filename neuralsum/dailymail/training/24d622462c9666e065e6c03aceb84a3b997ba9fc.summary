not everybody would feel as relaxed lying in a hammock strung thousands of feet up in the air between mountains			2
but then these thrill - seekers high up in the northern @entity6 alps are n't just anybody			1
they are members of a group of extreme athletes who have travelled to take part in the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity6			1
the inaugural meeting took place in 2012 , when @entity13 was identified as a great place for the sport , easily accessible and with a glorious past and a fairy tale atmosphere			1
the highliners came together for a week to practice their sport in harmony with nature and without mutual showdown , and it was such a success that now the meeting takes place annually			1
there are seemingly no end of daredevils who like nothing better than to take up the challenges posed by highwire walking			2
from natural geographical features such as waterfalls and gorges , to man - made objects such as skyscrapers and suspension bridges , tightrope walkers have attempted to walk across them all - with varying degrees of success			0
it 's a physical accomplishment which is not for the the faint of heart			0
not at that altitude anyway			0
perhaps they are secretly trying to emulate that great high wire walker @entity50 , alias @entity50 , of @entity52 , who made the earliest crossing of the @entity54 on a three - inch rope 1,100ft long and 160ft above the @entity54 in 1859			0
@entity50 thereafter made each crossing of the @entity57 in a different manner : blindfolded ; trundling a wheelbarrow ; on stilts , once with a man on his back , and once and sitting down halfway to make an omelette			0
these guys look like cooking a few eggs while they chill out in hammocks would n't be far beyond them			0
but how did he get the guitar there ? come join ! a highline walker heads towards his compadres who rest in a hammock on webbing stretched between rocks in the @entity6 @entity79 @entity80 : an extreme athlete makes the walk across a wire strung between the @entity79 thousands of feet above ground level nearly there : after his long walk across this tightrope enthusiast is almost at the other side now get back up there : losing your footing results in the inevitable , but a small safety rope stops this high wire enthusiast from plummeting to his death easy does it : a female highliner walks the line strung between rocks in the @entity79 as part of the gathering near @entity104 in northern @entity6 walk the line : a dramatic shot from low down shows three of the highliners criss crossing the gorge cosy in there ? this highliner is so happy to be resting in his snug hammock he 's catching 40 winks all tgether now , heave ! highliners tighten the webbings between rocks so they can continue to try new routes across the gorge that 's fairly high ! this shot shows just how far above the ground these thrill seekers are as they nonchalantly walk across the webbings then three came along all at once : @entity116 chat to each other , strung hundreds of feet above the ground and so to bed : a huddle of tents forms the makeshift village for a week as the highliners get some well - deserved sleep before another day of thrill seeking			1
