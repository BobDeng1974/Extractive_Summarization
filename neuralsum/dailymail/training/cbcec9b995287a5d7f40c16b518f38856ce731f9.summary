by @entity0 published : 07:01 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 21:51 est , 22 february 2013 a mother has told of her agony when she discovered police kept her baby ’s brain for 13 years			1
@entity7 ’s son @entity6 died of a heart defect two days after he was born in 1998 and his family gave consent for a post-mortem examination			1
they were not told that police had kept his brain at @entity15 until two officers recently knocked on her door to inform her			1
@entity7 said two officers knocked on her door ' totally @entity21 ' to admit that her son 's brain had been held at @entity15 for 13 years @entity6 died when he was just two days old and his family gave consent for a post-mortem examination to take place - but they ' assumed he had been buried in tact ' her son is one of 89 children whose body parts were kept by police , according to an @entity33 ( @entity33 ) audit			1
last year , the research showed police forces across the country held almost 500 body parts dating back about 50 years			1
the storage of child body parts echoes the scandal at @entity42 ’s @entity43 , where organs from nearly 3,000 youngsters were ‘ harvested ’ and kept without consent in the early 1990s			2
miss @entity7 , 35 , said : ‘ we had his funeral , we got on with our lives as you have to and 13 years later we have a knock on the door from the @entity55 police to inform us that his brain has been retained at @entity57			1
’ she said she ‘ did not know really how to take it ’ and added : ‘ we assumed he had been buried intact			0
we had absolutely no idea that they had kept his brain			1
’ police told the mother - of - five from @entity65 , @entity55 , that @entity67 ’s brain had been kept in storage , but could not tell her why			1
police could not explain to mrs @entity7 why her son 's brain had been kept in storage at @entity15 for so long she said : ‘ they told us tissue from @entity6 had been retained			1
i thought they meant a sliver of tissue on a slide			0
‘ then they said it was his whole brain			1
i was never told about this and if they had asked my permission i would have said “ no ”			0
‘ they would n’t tell me why it had been kept and they said nothing had been done to it			0
i had a new baby in my arms and it brought it all back			0
’ parents of children whose body parts were stored at @entity15 are desperate for an explanation			1
the hospital has said it acted only as a ‘ storage facility ’ for @entity55 police , the @entity100 or the coroner			2
after post-mortem examinations in criminal cases , body parts are often stored until trial dates are set			0
there was no criminal element to these cases , but most of the babies did have post-mortem examinations			0
a hospital spokesman said : ‘ there is no wrongdoing on behalf of the hospital trust			0
’ miss @entity7 said her family had now decided to donate @entity6 ’s brain to hospital research after being told other options were to have it destroyed or buried with his body			2
she added : ‘ i did n’t want another funeral			0
i ’ve got other children now			0
it ’s a difficult thing to talk about and i did n’t want to have to explain to my young children why we had to have a funeral			0
‘ and i did n’t really want him dug up to have his brain put with him			2
‘ i just do n’t like the thought of having a child dug up after they have been buried for 13 years			0
’ @entity15 said that after post-mortem examinations , the coroner or forensic officers may ask for organs to be retained in case they are needed for further investigation			1
the hospital said it holds specimens until the police or coroner give further instructions			2
the cases were uncovered in an @entity33 audit as a result of new , stricter laws on storing human tissue and organs			0
police forces nationwide have been ordered to draw up lists of all post-mortem samples kept in storage .			2
