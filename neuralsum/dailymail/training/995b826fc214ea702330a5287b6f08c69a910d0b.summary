by @entity0 business success : @entity2 , the football agent son of @entity3 , is understood to have secured a record fee for a @entity6 star this summer he has some way to go before he matches his father ’s multi- million - pound fortune			1
but @entity2 certainly seems to be heading in the right direction			1
after setting himself up as a football agent , @entity3 ’s middle son has reportedly struck his first big deal – collecting 10 per cent from a £ 6.7million transfer			1
@entity2 , 27 , apparently helped negotiate the big - money move of @entity6 @entity17 to top @entity19 side @entity18 in june			1
but that record transfer for a @entity6 player may be dwarfed if his compatriot @entity22 , who is also represented by @entity2 , is snapped up by @entity23 or @entity19 clubs next year for a reputed £ 10million			1

he is notoriously secretive about his wealth , with most of his earnings since he left office in 2007 hidden in a network of private firms			0
however he is believed to have paid for the a four - storey , £ 1.35million @entity61 townhouse in central @entity40 where @entity2 lives			2
@entity2 's mother was a director of @entity63 until may , owning 20 per cent , and allows her son to use a desk at her business in central @entity40			1
supportive : @entity2 , pictured left with his siblings @entity69 and @entity27 , has had help from his parents , including mother @entity72 , who is a director of his company and on one occasion helped court a young star on his behalf @entity78 : @entity27 is the eldest @entity2 child and is the only one with obvious political ambitions			1
the @entity81 seat of @entity82 could become vacant as current mp @entity83 may retire in 2015 , and the 29 - year - old is thought to be keen			0
he is currently chief commercial officer for recruitment agency @entity85			2
last month he married his long - term girlfriend @entity86 , 25 , in @entity87 , @entity88			0

in 2000 he was the first child born to a serving prime minister for 150 years , and was named after @entity3 's late father			2
mrs @entity113 had even taken major steps to help @entity2 secure top players in the @entity116			2
in 2011 she took time out of her busy international schedule to meet an unknown @entity6 footballer			2
a car collected then 17 - year - old soccer prodigy @entity120 from his family ’s rundown trailer - park home in a @entity124 - speaking suburb of @entity125 and took him to the plush hotel where the wife of the ex-prime minister was staying			0
she spent time chatting to the footballer before posing for a photograph with him			0
just days later , in an apparent attempt to cement confidence in her son ’s business , @entity120 ’s mother @entity130 received a picture of a smartly dressed @entity136 and @entity113 , personally signed with the words ‘ thank you ’			2
but it emerged that @entity120 had no idea he had entrusted his future to a man whose parents are on first - name terms with the world ’s most powerful people			0
speaking from her home in @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity130 said : ‘ @entity120 did n’t have a clue he was dealing with a former prime minister ’s son '			0
