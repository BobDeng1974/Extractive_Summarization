by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent lost custody : the unidentified woman will have her two sons , 11 and 14 , taken away following the ruling a mother said to have harmed her two sons by ‘ permissive parenting ’ has been stripped of the right to bring them up			1
the brothers , 11 and 14 , will now live with their father so they will be given ‘ the guidance and boundaries appropriate for teenage boys ’			1
a judge made the order after hearing that the boys , who lived with their mother after their parents ’ break - up , were staying up late , missing school , late for classes and neglecting their homework			1
the mother spent much of the day in bed while her sons were left to play computer games , judge @entity24 heard			1
she said the mother was ‘ complacent about the educational issues and minimised concerns about lateness , homework and general progress ’			0
adding that she thought it likely that the mother was depressed , the judge said : ‘ she does spend hours under the duvet , on the phone or using her @entity40 , and the children are left to their own devices			2
it seems to me to be likely that they are spending a lot of time playing on their own or on their xboxes			0
‘ she does have a very permissive style of parenting , and i accept the father ’s evidence that she is more like a friend than a parent			2
‘ i am satisfied that there is a failure to provide proper guidance and boundaries essential for the social and emotional development of these pre-adolescent and adolescent boys			0
’ the case is the latest in which separated and divorced mothers have been criticised by judges for neglecting the welfare of their children while encouraging hostility towards the father			0
judge @entity72 , sitting in the @entity73 of the @entity73 , said in her ruling – which has been published with the parents and children un-named – that the 41 - year - old mother had ‘ significantly failed ’ her sons			1
after hearing from a senior teacher and a court - appointed social worker , she said that the older boy ‘ is not achieving his educational potential , which is harmful to his future prospects ’			0
ruling : the case was heard in the family division of the @entity73 , which sits in the @entity89 in @entity90 , pictured @entity91 : the mother even accused judge @entity24 , pictured , of being biased towards her ex-husband the judge added that there was a risk the younger brother would ‘ go the same way ’			1
the boys ’ behaviour ‘ shows a lack of discipline and structure , ’ the judge said			0
‘ although the court must be tolerant of different standards of parenting , i consider the permissive parenting in this case has caused the children harm			0
’ judge @entity72 said the mother deeply resented the father , who she believed had begun an affair before their marriage broke up in 2002 , and who she believed had failed to pay properly for his sons ’ upbringing			1
she was awarded custody in 2002 , and in 2004 a court ruled that the children should live with their mother while having weekend contact with their father			1
in 2012 , the father asked a court for custody after repeatedly complaining that he had been denied contact with them			1
judge @entity72 said the father ‘ has , in my view , demonstrated far better insight into the needs of his boys ’			2
‘ he is much more in favour of structure , boundaries and discipline , and i can understand why the boys might baulk at that			0
’ judge @entity72 said the mother had manipulated the boys into hostility towards their 43 - year - old father and that her hatred of him was ‘ almost pathological ’			2
‘ so preoccupied is she with her own sense of grievance that she completely overlooks the effect of her behaviour on her children			0
in my judgment , she has prioritised her own needs and feelings at the expense of the needs of her children			0

@entity158 complained his ex-wife was not acting like a parent
family court judge agreed and said she had ' failed ' her sons , 11 and 14
the father was given custody after submitting plans to set boundaries
ruling was made in the family division of the @entity73 in @entity90
