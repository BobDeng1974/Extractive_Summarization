this boat jetty looking out on to @entity21 is one of very few man - made parts of the isle ample space : the four bedroom property on the island has extensive garden and driveway space due to its unique location although requiring access by boat or helicopter , the 260 - acre island is a haven for many forms of wildlife as well as the four - bedroom house , the island off @entity21 comes with a boat house , observatory for gazing at the @entity39 , and its own helicopter facility			1

there is an endless supply of salmon and lobsters that the new owner can exclusively fish for			2
the island is currently owned by top @entity65 trader @entity64 , a former partner in @entity66 , who has modernised the main house			2
room with a view : the owner of the island can look forward to seeing salmon , lobster and other forms of wildife in and around its shores spacious : the island also comes with its own boathouse and observatory he closed down the $ 200million business he began after leaving @entity66 and made a stunning confession about his ability to play the market			1

@entity108 , from the estate agents , said : ' the island is stunningly beautiful and surrounded by the most extraordinary land and seascapes			2
isolated : @entity11 sits 350 yards from the mainland of west @entity9 remote : the four bedroom house on the island provides spectacular views , but little neighbourly contact ' it is so peaceful and tranquil yet it only takes 10 minutes to travel by boat to reach the mainland or 25 minutes to fly by helicopter to @entity123			1
' the coastal village of @entity125 is the nearest settlement and has a large marina , supermarket and a thriving school			0
' the wildlife is also quite incredible and while the salmon farm just a few yards off the island is privately owned there is nothing to stop you from dropping a rod and line into the water			1
