playing quick paced action video games such as @entity2 or @entity3 can boost your ability to learn new motor skills , researchers have found			1
they say regular players seem to learn a new sensorimotor skills , such as riding a bike or typing , more quickly than non-gamers do			1
they say the skills are highly in demand , and useful for many careers - such as advanced surgery , for instance			2
@entity17 and @entity18 footballer @entity16 competing at the unveiling of the @entity2 : ghosts game : now researchers say playing quick paced action video games such as @entity2 or @entity3 can boost your ability to learn new skills			1
a new sensorimotor skill , such as learning to ride a bike or typing , often requires a new pattern of coordination between vision and motor movement			1
with such skills , an individual generally moves from novice performance , characterized by a low degree of coordination , to expert performance , marked by a high degree of coordination			2
as a result of successful sensorimotor learning , one comes to perform these tasks efficiently and perhaps even without consciously thinking about them			2
the @entity44 study discovered people who play action video games such as @entity2 or @entity3 seem to learn a new sensorimotor skill more quickly than non-gamers do			1

with such skills , an individual generally moves from novice performance , characterized by a low degree of coordination , to expert performance , marked by a high degree of coordination			2

' we wanted to understand if chronic video game playing has an effect on sensorimotor control , that is , the coordinated function of vision and hand movement , ' said graduate student @entity72 , who led the study			0
in the early stages of doing the tasks , the gamers ' performance was not significantly better than non-gamers			0
' this suggests that while chronically playing action video games requires constant motor control , playing these games does not give gamers a reliable initial advantage in new and unfamiliar sensorimotor tasks , ' said @entity72			1
researchers set up two experiments			0
in the first , 18 gamers ( those who played a first - person shooter game at least three times per week for at least two hours each time in the previous six months ) and 18 non-gamers ( who had little or no video game use in the past two years ) performed a manual tracking task			0
using a computer mouse , they were instructed to keep a small green square cursor at the centre of a white square moving target which moved in a very complicated pattern that repeated itself			0
the task probes sensorimotor control , because participants see the target movement and try to coordinate their hand movements with what they see			0
by the end of the experiment , all participants performed better as they learned the complex pattern of the target			0
the gamers , however , were significantly more accurate in following the repetitive motion than the non-gamers			0
' this is likely due to the gamers ' superior ability in learning a novel sensorimotor pattern , that is , their gaming experience enabled them to learn better than the non-gamers			1
' in the next experiment , the researchers wanted to test whether the superior performance of the gamers was indeed a result of learning rather than simply having better sensorimotor control			0
to eliminate the learning component of the experiment , they required participants to again track a moving dot , but in this case the patterns of motion changed throughout the experiment			0
@entity2 : @entity130 : gaming experience enabled people to learn new motor skills better than the non-gamers in a test the result this time : neither the gamers nor the non-gamers improved as time went by , confirming that learning was playing a key role and the gamers were learning better			1
one of the benefits of playing action games may be an enhanced ability to precisely learn the dynamics of new sensorimotor tasks			1
@entity147 , another game the team found helped give people the ability to develop new motor skills quickly such skills are key , for example , in laparoscopic surgery which involves high precision manual control of remote surgery tools through a computer interface			1
the research was done in collaboration with @entity161 who has appointments with both the @entity163 and the @entity164			0
their study is published in the journal @entity168 .			0
