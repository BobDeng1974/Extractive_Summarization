by @entity0 published : 20:57 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 20:58 est , 26 october 2013 an @entity3 woman says she 's a firm believer in @entity5 after meeting him during the nine minutes she died in 2009			1
@entity7 is a 36 - year - old married school teacher and mother of four who did n't quite believe in @entity5 for most of her life			1
at the age of three , @entity7 started to be sexually abused by her drug and alcohol - addicted step father and that abuse continued by him and others until the age of 12			1
believer : after accidentally overdosing on drugs in a hospital while being treated for pancreatitis , @entity7 says she woke up in heaven where she met @entity5 those experiences made her second guess from a young age whether or not @entity5 existed , and if he did , whether he loved her			1
' i saw a lot of things that children should n't see , ' she told @entity29			0
' i always believed that @entity5 had abandoned me , that he did n't save me , that he did n't love me and i questioned if he was real			1
' then , when she was a teenager , she had an abortion			0
a choice she believed cemented her position as a sinner			0
' after that abortion i thought , " i 've done it now - if he was real , he could never love me now , " ' she told @entity38			1
skeptic : @entity7 says abuse when she was a child led her to doubt @entity5 's existence , but that changed the moment she died in december 2009 , @entity7 was taken to the hospital to be treated for pancreatitis when she was accidentally overdosed on pain medication			1
the last thing @entity7 remembers is being given the drugs and falling asleep			2
for the next nine minutes , doctors struggled to revive her as her heart stopped beating			2
@entity7 says she was in a more peaceful place			2
after closing her eyes in the hospital , the next thing she remembers is waking up in heaven			2
' i was standing in the most gorgeous light and instantly i recognized where i was			0
i knew who i was , i knew where i was ... ' she recalls			0
in heaven , time seemed to stand still			0
she recalls being in the presence of two angels - though they did n't look like anyone she had ever met on earth			1
at the pearly gates : @entity7 says at one point during her period in @entity70 , @entity5 presented himself to her but not in his human form			1
she says they communicated non-verbally at one point , @entity5 presented himself to her , but not in human form			2
still she knew who he was and says that she could feel his presence with much more than the five senses she had on earth			0
they did n't even need to communicate with words			0
one of the things she remembers most about the experience was @entity5 conjuring up the image of a young girl , laughing and playing			1
looking back on the experience , she believes that girl was a version of herself before the sexual abuse made her lose faith			0
being in the presence of @entity5 and seeing that innocent version of herself , the weight was lifted from her dark past			0
' i just remember i felt free from all the lies i had lived and the untruth that @entity5 did n't love me , ' she told the @entity96			1
spreading the word : a few years after her near - death experience , @entity98 has published a book about her encounter with @entity5 in the afterlife she felt so overcome with happiness that when he asked her if she wanted to go back to her husband and four children , she opted to stay in heaven			1
she says @entity5 assured her that they would be fine without her			0
it was only when she heard her mother calling out from her hospital bedside that she changed her mind			0
' i just felt such pity ( for my mom ) and i turned around to find her voice - and ( @entity5 ) said , " tell them what you can remember " ' she recalled			2
and just like that , she was back in her hospital room - miraculously alive again			0
@entity7 is n't the first to claim she communicated with @entity5 in the afterlife			1
neuroscientist @entity122 explained in @entity123 that these experiences have a biological answer in the side effects of medicinal and recreational drugs			0
in @entity7 's case , those would be the drugs she accidentally overdosed on while being treated for pancreatitus			2
but for @entity7 , the experience was real and she has n't let the non-believers keep her from sharing her story			1
a few years ago she realized that it was her duty to share her story with the world , and so authored a book about her 9 minutes in heaven titled ' waking up in @entity70 ' which was published this past june			2
she hopes the book will help others realize that ' no matter how broken and beaten ' they are , that ' there is nothing that you can do in your life that will ever separate his love from you ' .			0

@entity7 , 36 , died for nine minutes after doctors overdosed her on pain medication in the hospital

the married school teacher and mother of four says she was sexually - abused as a child and *underwent* an abortion when she was a teen which led her to believe @entity5 did n't love her or did n't exist
