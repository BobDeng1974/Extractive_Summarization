@entity86 , an aunt of @entity1 , told @entity65 that both girls were going through a ‘ mixture of emotions ’			1
she said : ‘ there ’s so many mixed feelings about it			0
@entity93 is a little confused			0
we are trying to protect her because we have to remember , she was a 14 - year - old girl ( when she was kidnapped )			0
' but @entity93 and @entity1 wo n’t have to think about him because he ’s not around any more			2
’ she also revealed that @entity93 ’s mother @entity98 has been able to move beyond her anger and is already pitying @entity1			2

we have a very strong , spiritual family and so does @entity1			1

she does n’t feel any anger			0
' @entity1 - whose daughter is fathered by @entity1 - has also not commented on his death			2
though @entity1 serially abused the women physically , emotionally , and sexually on a daily basis , they were also so badly manipulated they developed ' @entity110 ' - slowly ' bonding ' with their captor in gratitude for rare small favors he would grant them			1
his suicide will have come as a slap in the face to his victims and their families , robbing them of the justice that had brought some form of closure to their ten - year nightmare			0
lonely death : this is an isolation cell at @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity9 , like the one where @entity1 hanged himself on september 3 @entity1 was being housed alone in an isolation unit for his protection , where he would be checked every 30 minutes			1

initially , @entity1 was being checked on every ten minutes , but this stopped in june after he was deemed not to be a risk to himself and taken off suicide watch			2
an autopsy confirmed his death was suicide by hanging			0
@entity1 's attorneys tried unsuccessfully to have an independent psychological examination of the 53 - year - old done at the @entity149 before he was turned over to state authorities following his conviction			2
a full investigation is underway as to how he was able to take his own life while under the watchful eye of prison guards - who said he was always calm and cooperative with them			2
while his defense attorneys said they are suspicious as to why their client would have committed suicide just one month into his prison term , @entity149 prosecutor @entity157 issued a scathing statement			2
' these degenerate molesters are cowards			0
they con and capture vulnerable children , ' he said			0
' this man could n't take , for even a month , a small portion of what he had dished out for more than a decade			0
' let this be a message to other child kidnappers : there will be a heavy price to pay when you are caught			0
you wo n't enjoy the captive side of the bars			0
' house of horrors : this is the four - bedroom home where @entity1 kept his victims for a decade - unbeknown to his family or his neighbors restraints : a rusty chain can be seen over a dirty mattress on the floor of the room @entity1 and @entity1 shared basement : the pole the girls were all chained to and raped many times throughout their time in captivity is pictured as well as his four elder children , @entity1 fathered a young girl to victim @entity1			1
it is unclear if the child knows her father is dead			0
@entity1 was jailed after keeping @entity1 , @entity1 and @entity1 captive in unimaginable conditions in his house for ten years			1

he was taken to @entity205 , where he was pronounced dead about an hour and a half later - shortly before 11pm			0
it costs nearly $ 25,000 a year on average to house a prison inmate in @entity9			0
the cost to house @entity1 , who was kept in high security , would likely have been much higher			2
@entity1 's family - he has a son and three daughters by his ex-wife - were informed of his suicide about 1am			1
