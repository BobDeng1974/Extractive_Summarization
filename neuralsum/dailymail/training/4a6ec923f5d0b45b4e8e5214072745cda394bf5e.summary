goals : @entity69 ( pen ) booked : altidore referee : @entity81 ( @entity82 ) for the whole match they had reacted insanely to @entity9 's every movement			1
they were undeterred even when @entity87 took the lead in the 10th minute through @entity69 's penalty			1
the @entity91 striker took a slow run - up and calmly struck the spot kick down the middle after @entity4 's @entity40 had handled in the box			2
ahead of kick off a red double - decker @entity97 bus was completely taken over by @entity100 fans , partying their way down the @entity102			0
closer to @entity0 , @entity103 running along the outside of the ground was crammed with yellow , well before the turnstiles were opened			0
the mere appearance of @entity109 's @entity9 – who was their star and one of the players of the @entity113 – and the stadium was akin to a secondary girls school assembly being paid a surprise visit by @entity117			1
even when he did barely anything , the decibel levels rose			0
at one point in the first half , he crossed the ball from the right - hand side			2
it was n't a particularly special cross and @entity28 's header was even less spectacular , sailing well over the bar , but the @entity100 crowd reacted as if they had just witnessed the winner in a @entity113 final			1
two minutes later he actually produced a moment worthy of cheer , when he sent a free kick from just outside the box on the left fizzing low towards the far right corner with his left - foot and inches wide of the post			2
yet the closest the @entity100 's came to scoring before the break did not involve @entity9 at all			2

the @entity5 had been dominated for the majority of the first half , but they came out in the second and carved out one of the best chances of the match within minutes			1
@entity66 crossed into the box and @entity70 got in front of his man , dove at the ball and headed narrowly wide from close range			0

and it involved that man , of course			0
@entity9 played a delicate through ball into the path of @entity28 who had made an angled run into the box , rounded @entity30 and scored			1
