that a game for @entity1 in their own @entity2 should end with the opposition goalkeeper emerging as the runaway man of the match should perhaps surprise nobody			1
this was certainly some night for a curly - hurled guy from @entity10 called @entity11			1
nevertheless , this was a night that told us something more about the host nation as they look to seek a coronation in front of their own people this summer			0
this is a @entity1 team that will need to improve significantly if it is not to stumble when the stakes grow higher later in the tournament			1
@entity27 ’s team should certainly reach phase two now			0
this was a draw that actually suited both teams pretty well , even if the 55,000 @entity32 packed in to the @entity33 went home feeling less than sated			2
video @entity11 brilliance denies @entity1 no way past : @entity10 goalkeeper @entity11 makes a superb instinctive save from @entity37 ( centre ) beaten to the punch : @entity11 clears the ball under pressure from @entity42 rising to the occasion : @entity44 gets above @entity45 and sends a header towards goal saving the day : @entity10 goalkeeper @entity11 keeps the ball out , @entity51 style , as @entity1 come close comparison : some people remarked that @entity11 's save from @entity44 was like @entity54 ' from @entity55 super saver : @entity11 gets in the way on the stroke of half - time as @entity60 ( left ) and @entity42 lurk @entity1 : ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity61 6 ; @entity62 6.5 , @entity63 6 , @entity60 6.5 , @entity64 5.5 ; @entity42 6 , @entity65 6 ; @entity66 6 ( @entity67 , 6 ) , @entity44 7 , @entity68 6.5 ( @entity69 84 ) ; @entity70 ( @entity71 67 , 5 ) subs : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81			1

man of the match : @entity11			1
referee : @entity107 ( @entity108 )			0
unquestionably , though , this @entity32 team is deficient			0
for all the impish genius of the new golden child @entity44 , @entity1 still lack a through the middle goal scorer			1
in defenders @entity60 and @entity64 , meanwhile , they have footballers born to play in opposition territory			2
sadly that is only half of their job			0
they created chances last night and they should have taken at least a couple			0
@entity11 , released by the little known @entity125 club @entity124 , who play in @entity128 's @entity127 , had one of those nights he will talk about forever			1
conversely , though , @entity1 continued to look wide open once the centre of their midfield was punctured and , from that perspective , it still looks as though @entity27 has some tinkering to do			1
do not , for example , be surprised if @entity139 ’s centre player @entity74 comes in to the reckoning before long as @entity1 seek a way to become more resolute			1
on a wonderful , humid @entity143 night , this was some occasion , some atmosphere and , given the lack of goals , some game			0
it began at a gallop , with tackles being exchanged with the ferocious abandon of a @entity152 grudge match , and grew in to a night of punch and counter punch			0
floored genius : @entity44 lies prone on the turf after some rough treatment from the @entity158 crowded out : @entity44 tries to escape three @entity10 defenders on a frustrating night for @entity1 having a go : @entity44 takes a free - kick but the ball arcs just wide of the @entity10 goal ( below ) back of the net : @entity44 found his way into the goal but the ball stayed out putting it in : @entity67 ( no 20 ) tries to make something happen for @entity1 under pressure from @entity92 at full stretch : @entity172 in the @entity1 goal dives for the ball @entity1 were the better team and they should have won			1
without the help of a referee this time , though , they lacked cohesion at times			0
for long periods , their rhythm deserted them and there was not a single passage of play that made you think that @entity10 were not capable of doing something to spoil the party completely			1
after the initial frantic exchanges , with the crowd at fever pitch , @entity1 settled down to play and the peculiar looking @entity11 was asked to make his two decisive contributions of the first half			1
first it was @entity44 – @entity1 ’s stand - out player – who was denied			1
having almost worked a one - two with @entity42 , @entity44 was on the six yard line when a cross from @entity62 delivered the ball back in to the penalty area			0
the @entity202 player seemed second best to reach the ball but he leaped well and his downward header seemed destined for the corner until @entity11 pawed it away with his right hand			1
no pain , no gain : @entity44 is left on the floor as @entity27 shouts at the officials showboating : home favourite @entity44 keeps the ball in the air despite the attentions of @entity89 sent flying : former @entity217 forward @entity216 trips over @entity62 it was a great save – perhaps the best of the @entity2 so far – and he followed it with another just before the interval , this time advancing from his line quickly to smother @entity42 ’s effort after @entity37 had chested a cross down cleverly in to the @entity217 midfielder ’s path			1
@entity10 did n’t create such clear chances early on but they did carry a threat and an ambitious intent that was to manifest itself much later in the piece			1
in to the second half , though , and once again @entity11 was asked to come to the fore			1
not for a while , though			0
for the first 20 minutes of the second period , @entity1 got stuck in one of their feet of clay periods and it was @entity10 who pressed , with @entity89 and @entity87 advancing to clobber drives narrowly off target from distance			1
ultimately , though , enlivened by well - times @entity27 substitutes , @entity1 did come again			2
@entity44 may have done better than drive a shot against the goalkeeper ’s knees from an angle before @entity60 got his flat feet in a tangle when a chance presented itself courtesy of an @entity62 pass soon after			0
striding out : @entity253 attempts to make something happen as @entity1 are frustrated battling it out : @entity68 ( left ) and @entity83 fight for the ball during a tight first half getting stuck in : @entity89 feels the full force of a challenge by @entity62 chopped down : @entity10 full back @entity85 is fouled by @entity62 tussle : @entity66 ( left ) tries to get the better of @entity10 's defender @entity89 it was , however , the @entity32 captain who went back to the team base cursing himself after spurning the chance of the night with five minutes left			1
lucky to still be on the field after almost cutting @entity93 in two moments earlier , the big central defender @entity37 was completely unmarked when a free - kick from the left dropped on his forehead six yards from goal			0
at first sight it looked as though @entity11 had saved unbelievably but the replays showed that @entity37 had the whole goal at his mercy and somehow managed to head the ball towards the only place where it was n’t going to go in			2
at that point , @entity1 knew they would n’t win			2
it summed up the night , though , that they then almost lost			0
twice in injury time , @entity172 was troubled from distance , the second shot , from substitute @entity289 a spectacular effort from wide on the right			0
two games in and @entity1 will not complain			2
better opposition may unmask them more revealingly , though			0
passion : former @entity296 defender @entity60 leads an emotional @entity32 national anthem emotion : @entity2 poster boy @entity44 was reduced to tears by the national anthem all smiles : @entity1 supporters watching the @entity10 match in a ' @entity303 ' in @entity304 dressed to impress : @entity32 fans in @entity306 ahead of the game against @entity10 contingent : there were plenty of @entity10 fans in attendance for the @entity313 game @entity62 dyes for the cause @entity315 was abuzz with a contentious issue from this game — @entity62 ’ new hairstyle			1
the @entity202 right back chose to dye his normal dark colour an unusual hue and the decision was trending , with @entity323 defender @entity322 posting : ‘ @entity10 looking good here , think they will get something out the game			2
@entity70 is terrible also @entity62 haircut is a disaster ’			0
there were many fine displays for @entity10 but nobody outperformed @entity45			2
now 35 , @entity45 is @entity10 ’s most decorated footballer			2
this was a record fourth time he has captained them at the @entity2 — and it comes after a 15 - month spell out of the side			2
he was recalled for the play - off win over @entity339			0
we can sometimes get dewy - eyed about @entity1 and @entity341 but the reason they set the standard at these tournaments has nothing to do with nostalgia — it is down to achievement			2
qualification for the knockout stages would be their 18th in a row .			0

@entity1 and @entity10 play out second *goalless* draw of the @entity2
hosts could not find a way past goalkeeper @entity11
