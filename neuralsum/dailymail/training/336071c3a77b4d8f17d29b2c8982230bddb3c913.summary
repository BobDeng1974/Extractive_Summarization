a @entity1 mathematician claims it is possible to predict the results of a lottery draw by applying complicated maths and probability theories			1
@entity7 has found it is entirely possible to predict numbers which are more likely to appear than others , by following the same behaviour patterns as predicted by the @entity12			1
his study called the geometry of chance : @entity16 follow a predicted pattern , finds not all combinations of numbers have the same probability of occurring – so in short , it is possible to predict patterns of numbers with a greater chance of being drawn			1
the mathematician behind the study has created a website which uses colour patterns to show number combinations which are more likely to win the lottery based on previous draws in 20 lotteries from around the world - but you may need more than @entity35 maths to decipher the code the study claims that there is a pattern which is applicable in all lotteries around the world , which can be worked out using a complicated coloured template			1
mr @entity7 said ‘ @entity43 should no longer be seeing as a form of a gambling but a true representation of the probabilistic theory and the @entity12			1
’ it is n’t however as simple as being able to pick the six most likely numbers to win the @entity43 , it is however possible to pick several combinations of numbers which are more likely to be drawn based on probability			1
the mathematician has a website www.lotorainbow.com.br/en/default.asp which allows people to view the likelihood of different numbers being drawn in 20 different lotteries around the world - but readers may need a maths degree themselves to understand it			1
the maths behind the theory is based on previous draws and patterns which arise from them – previous draws dictate the future probability of certain number being drawn			1
combinations of certain numbers are more likely to win than others according to probability			0
in short not all combinations of numbers have an equal chance of being drawn - but it is still highly difficult to predict actual winning combinations if you toss a coin you have a one in two chance of getting a head but you might not get one at all			1
if you toss the coin many times you ’re going to move more towards a 50/50 split of heads or tails ( i.e. it ’ll look more like the probability you ’ve been given )			0
combinations of certain numbers are more likely to win than others			0
so it ’s about looking at the choices you ’ve made as a whole rather than the individual numbers			0
rather than saying there are 12.271.512 different possible combinations @entity7 reduced it to 210 coloured templates , which represent all combinations			2
he ’s then worked out the likelihood of getting each of these combinations			0
for example , if someone were to choose all low numbers ( in the 1 - 9 range ) they have a 0.0007 % chance of their template coming up as there ’s only 84 combinations of using these numbers			2
but if they were to choose one across all the different colours ( with two purples ) they have a 2.6403 % chance of their template coming up as there ’s 324,000 different combinations that use these numbers			2
the study says : ‘ the frequentist notion states that the probability of a given event relates to the frequency at which such event is repeated			0
additionally , as predicted by the @entity12 , when an event is repeated many times , the average of the results from all events should be close to the expected result			0
thus , games of all kinds in which many repetitions occur ( such as lotteries ) are ideal labs for the study of probabilities			0
now a new study shows that not all combinations of numbers have the same probability of occurring in a lottery draw			1
‘ the study is based on mathematics and probabilities theories applied to lottery drawings			0
it adopts a coloured template that determines all the possible combinations of numbers , as established by @entity150 's rule			0
the adoption of this coloured template provides an easier understanding , and correct identification , of the combinations of numbers with highest probabilities to win			0
through experimentation , the method shows that it is possible to detect that the results of a lottery draw follow the same behaviour pattern as predicted by the @entity12			1
‘ for instance , using the method proposed by @entity7 , templates built on previous results from a number of lottery games in different countries show that as more draws are performed , the expected result of each template is closer to the observed result , indicating that a pattern for these combinations exists			2
thus , the right choice of combinations can greatly increase your chances of picking the winning combination in your next lottery ticket			0
‘ the method was tested with more than 20 lottery draws all over the world , and in each case it demonstrates that the probability that a given group of combinations ( defined according to the coloured template adopted ) will occur is not the same for all groups of combinations and that there are groups that show a higher probability to win			2

@entity7 says it is possible to predict winning lottery numbers
theory is based on patterns as predicted by @entity12
@entity1 claims not all numbers have equal chance of being drawn
he 's developed website to help people select more *favorable* combinations
but users may need more than basic maths to understand how it works
study was based on 20 lotteries around the world
