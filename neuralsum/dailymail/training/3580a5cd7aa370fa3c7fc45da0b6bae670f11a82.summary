ever since the @entity2 express @entity0 pulled out of @entity3 and into @entity4 , @entity7 football ’s top division has been bereft of a player with the pace , close control and courage to run with the ball from deep			1
now , thanks to @entity4 and @entity16 deciding they were surplus to requirements , @entity13 and @entity14 are tearing up the @entity18 and terrorising its defences			1
@entity20 takes a look at what makes @entity23 ’s @entity24 and @entity26 ’s @entity25 so unstoppable			2
@entity14 ( left ) and @entity13 have injected pace and power into the @entity18 @entity4 star @entity0 ( left ) has a similar style to the new @entity18 recruits passing and vision it ’s easier to find space in the @entity18 than it is in @entity34 , where almost all teams have two defensive midfielders shielding the back four and often do n’t come out of their own half – particularly if they are playing @entity4 or @entity16			1
@entity14 and @entity39 would have been used to playing tight games against teams camped in and around their own penalty area and neither can probably believe the space they are now finding in @entity7			1
@entity44 has spoken about this key difference between @entity46 and the @entity18			2
@entity14 ( centre ) is n't afraid to run at defenders from deep as he showed against @entity49 @entity39 will have been used to playing in tight games while at @entity4 @entity23 's new signing looks to skip past @entity53 midfielder @entity52 on sunday ' in @entity7 opponents come chasing you and it is easier to play a quick one - two and go beyond him into space , ' he says			1
' you ca n’t do that in @entity34 where you are likely to be up against two very shrewd defensive midfielders			0
' many of the players who move from @entity46 to the @entity18 talk about the anarchy of @entity7 football with the crowd roaring both sides on and players responding by throwing caution to the wind at the expensive of positional discipline			0
both @entity39 and @entity14 are bound to benefit			2
both @entity14 and @entity39 will benefit from finding more space in the @entity18 @entity13 ( above ) made his @entity18 debut for @entity23 against @entity75 @entity76 it was once said of @entity78 that he runs faster with the ball than without it and it is easy to get the same impression watching @entity39			1
the run down the left that led to @entity86 ’s goal on sunday was reminiscent of @entity87 at his best			0
@entity14 is also bursting with pace although perhaps not the same control over longer distances as the @entity23 man			1
@entity92 both @entity14 and @entity39 can go past people in tight areas but neither will try to do so if they see a more efficient route to goal via either a shot or a cross			1
both players have all the tricks but neither is a showman for the sake of it			0
the goals and assists statistics from last season prove that – it ’s all about end product			0
the former @entity16 forward looks to get past @entity110 ( left ) on saturday set - pieces did @entity39 over-hit that free - kick ? surely if he had over-hit it , it would have ended up in the seating behind the goal instead of the back of the net			2
it was a clever delivery perfectly measured to zip over the turf just in that dangerous area between advancing keeper and the back - pedaling defenders ; designed to end in the far corner , or if someone got a touch on it , to beat the keeper at his near post			0
both these two can score from set - pieces and both will be glad of having moved up the pecking order : @entity39 was behind @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity0 at @entity4 and @entity14 behind @entity78 , @entity135 and @entity136 last season at @entity16			1
@entity39 scored @entity23 's first against @entity53 on sunday with a free - kick @entity14 ( right ) celebrates scoring @entity26 's second goal against @entity49 with a superb volley @entity141 @entity14 scored 21 goals last season for @entity16 finishing behind only @entity78 in the scoring stakes			1
it ’s little wonder he has been increasingly used by his country through the middle , although with @entity26 dominating many of the games in which he plays up front means he spends too much time with his back to goal – a monumental waste of his ability to run into space			2
@entity156 seems to have realised that with the purchase of @entity159			0
@entity14 ( above ) has settled in well at @entity26 , scoring three goals so far including this one against @entity161 killer pass @entity39 played the final ball in 17 of @entity4 ’s goals last season and created a staggering 91 chances			1
he topped the assist table in @entity46 with @entity168 ’s @entity167 creating 68 chances and @entity44 , in his final season at @entity16 , 58			0
sometimes the assist is unintentional			0
in the @entity173 final against @entity168 last season it was his shot on goal that bobbled up for @entity0 to head @entity4 in front			2
@entity14 also made it into double figures at @entity16 with 10 assists in @entity46			0
his decision making improved across his three seasons at the @entity181 and @entity26 can now reap the benefits of that			0
@entity185 @entity184 is loved by his team - mates and isknown for setting them up on a regular basis			0

@entity14 and @entity13 bring pace , close control and courage to the @entity18
the *dynamic* *duo* have similar playing styles to @entity0
@entity39 scored his first goal for @entity23 during his team 's 4 - 0 win against @entity53 on sunday
@entity14 has three goals to his name in an @entity26 shirt
