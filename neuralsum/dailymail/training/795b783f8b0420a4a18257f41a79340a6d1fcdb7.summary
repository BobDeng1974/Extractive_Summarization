by @entity1 reporter concern : a natural ' cuddle hormone ' could held alleviate the symptoms of anorexia a hormone released when kissing could help beat anorexia			1
oxytocin reduces sufferers ’ unhealthy obsessions with food and weight and makes them less fixated on damaging emotions , researchers found			2
a spray of the chemical could be used as a treatment in two or three years if larger trials succeed			2
it is hoped it would help patients understand the need to eat more , raising odds of recovery			2
there are no drugs to treat the life - threatening disorder , whose sufferers try to be as thin as possible by drastically limiting food and undertaking extreme exercise			0
in severe cases , counselling is often of little benefit because the brain is so undernourished			0
@entity39 and @entity40 scientists tested oxytocin , which is also released during sex , childbirth and breastfeeding			1
anorexics who took the chemical focused less on photos of food and paid less attention than before to images of flabby thighs or stomachs			0
dubbed the ' love hormone ' or the ' cuddle chemical ' , oxytocin also changed anorexic patients ’ responses to images of angry and disgusted faces , according to one piece of research			1
the research was published in the journal @entity64 after subjects were given oxytocin using a nasal spray			1
the same 31 participants in a study published in the journal @entity70 , testing their reactions to facial expressions such as anger , disgust and happiness , were less likely to linger on ' disgust ' faces			0
prof @entity77 , from @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity40 and lead author on both studies , said : ' our research shows that oxytocin reduces patients ' unconscious tendencies to focus on food , body shape , and negative emotions such as disgust			1
' there is currently a lack of effective pharmacological treatments for anorexia			0
our research adds important evidence to the increasing literature on oxytocin treatments for mental illnesses , and hints at the advent of a novel , ground - breaking treatment option for patients with anorexia			1
' treatment : the hormone was given to 31 patients through a nasal spray ( file photo posed by model ) professor @entity111 , of @entity112 and senior author for both studies said : ' patients with anorexia have a range of social difficulties which often start in their early teenage years , before the onset of the illness			1
' these social problems , which can result in isolation , may be important in understanding both the onset and maintenance of anorexia			0
' by using oxytocin as a potential treatment for anorexia , we are focusing on some of these underlying problems we see in patients			2
' she added : ' this is early stage research with a small number of participants , but it ’s hugely exciting to see the potential this treatment could have			1
' we need much larger trials , on more diverse populations , before we can start to make a difference to how patients are treated			0
' anorexia is one of the leading causes of mental - health related deaths both through physical complications and suicide			0
as well as problems with food , eating and body shape , patients with anorexia often have social difficulties including anxiety and hypersensitivity to negative emotions .			0
