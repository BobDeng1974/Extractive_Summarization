the @entity1 government will use satellite technology to stem the tide of illegal immigrants fleeing to @entity5 on top of huge freight trains nicknamed @entity8 or ‘ @entity9 ’			1
people desperate to escape the poverty of the south clamber aboard the slow - moving trains and sit on the roof as they trundle north towards the @entity5 - @entity1 border			1
the trains are also used by traffickers to get people into the @entity5			0
thousands of @entity20 migrants ride the trains , known as @entity8 , or @entity9 , during their journey through @entity1 to reach the @entity23 of the immigrants are robbed and assaulted by gangs who control the train tops , while others fall asleep and fall off losing limbs ( file picture ) announcing $ 450,000 to be spent on improving tracks that have been neglected for years in six southern states , @entity33 , the head of the federal government 's southern border improvement plans , said that a dozen satellite - monitored vehicles will be used ahead of cargo trains near @entity1 's southern border with @entity40			1
it is here that many of the immigrants get onto the trains as they head north			0
@entity9 stops at @entity45 , @entity1 and yet more illegal immigrants - from the old to the very young - clamber aboard on their way to the @entity5 - @entity1 border where they will try to illegally enter @entity5 the new scheme is meant to ' prevent migrants from putting at risk the safety of the trains which are for cargo , not passengers , ' @entity50 said			1
