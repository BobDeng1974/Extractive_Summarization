by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 01:16 est , 22 july 2013 when the @entity3 subway was barely seven months old , the @entity1 mounted a camera on the front of a subway car following another train , and took footage of a ride through @entity10			1
the footage taken on may 21 , 1905 begins at 14th @entity12 and follows the train north to @entity14 , whereupon the passengers alight and men in smart suits with canes and women in long dresses and elaborate hats swarm around the station			1
to film the subway car in front , engineers affixed the camera to a specially constructed work car fitted with lights to illuminate the dark tunnel			0
delays , track work and the infamous g train may cause current @entity3 to complain , but these inconveniences are trifling compared to the upheaval the construction of the original subway must have caused			1
when it was being constructed more than 100 years ago , the subway 's creators could n't have known that in 2013 , it would carry more than five million passengers daily along 842 miles of track			1
the subway , which is the most extensive public transport system in the world with 468 operational stations , is constantly under construction and evolving along with the city itself			0
missed train : commuters ran for the train just as today 's subway customers run to catch a departing subway train growth : the subway is now the biggest transit system in the world , but @entity73 's @entity72 is older at 150 years as the @entity74 creates a new subway line on the east side of @entity10 , @entity3 of today can get an idea of what the construction of the line must have been like more than a century ago			1
the @entity81 is being built in phases			0
ground was first broken in 2007 and excavation continues now for the city 's newest subway tunnel 134 feet below the street			2
the line will not be completed until 2016			0
the @entity89 said of the 1905 footage : ' at the time of filming , the subway was only seven months old , having opened on october 27 , 1904			2
the ride begins at @entity95 ( @entity12 ) following the route of today ’s east side @entity98 , and ends at the old @entity14 , built by @entity99 in 1869			0
the @entity14 in use today was not completed until 1913			0
' out of the darkness : the first @entity3 subway was hailed as a feat of engineering when it was opened in 1905 rail trail : a second subway followed the first to film its journey from @entity95 to @entity108 in 1905 light at the end : a specially constructed work car with lighting attached lit the subway passage as the train made its way to 42nd @entity12 newly built : the @entity3 subway was brand - new when the footage was taken but now it 's a part of the city 's identity first subway : the @entity3 subway was groundbreaking , both literally and figuratively , when it arrived and changed the city 's transport system forever how times have changed : an early subway map shows the route the first trains took under the @entity3 streets modernized : the @entity3 subway has been upgraded over the years but it runs essentially as its originators had planned the @entity89 said of the footage : ' at the time of filming , the subway was only seven months old , having opened on october 27 , 1904			1
the ride begins at @entity95 ( @entity12 ) following the route of today ’s east side @entity98 , and ends at the old @entity14 , built by @entity99 in 1869			0
the @entity14 in use today was not completed until 1913			0
' before the first subway train made its historic journey in october 1904 , engineers and electricians had planned the infrastructure and inner workings of the audacious public work			2
what they came up with more than 100 years ago has undergone upgrades and been modernized with new technologies , but the subway system is still working much as its originators had planned .			1

footage was taken of a train 's journey through the @entity3 subway 108 years ago
the remarkable video shows a subway trip from 14th @entity12 to @entity12
