by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 13:11 est , 1 november 2013 this is the idyllic garden bridge that @entity2 could one day be able to cross for a moment of calm in the heart of @entity8 's busiest city			2
the leafy walkway , packed with flower beds and trees , was first suggested by actress @entity12 following princess @entity14 's death as far back as 1997			2
but now a new public consultation has been launched meaning the bridge could open as soon as 2016 , providing a new river crossing from @entity18 to the @entity19			1
groundbreaking : consultation opened today for @entity2 to give their say on 370 - ft aerial oasis actress @entity12 thought up in 1997 to mark the occasion , a new image of the 370 - ft landmark has been released for @entity2 to have a look at			1
the consultation will ask for verdicts on every little detail including the colour , the shape , the location , and whether dogs can be allowed on			2
it would be the first new crossing over the @entity35 since the ' wobbly ' @entity36 opened in 2002 and @entity38 's answer to @entity40 's @entity39 , where a disused train line has been transformed into a lush aerial park			1
it would also give stunning views along the river of @entity46 and the @entity47 to the east			0
with lauded architect @entity52 at the helm , famed for his @entity55 cauldron for @entity56 , everyone from @entity50 to @entity40 mayor @entity51 have weighed in to show their support			1
according to @entity60 , it could be the iconic piece of green infrastructure that he has been looking for to give @entity38 a high - quality image			1
designer and @entity65 , appointed to oversee the gardening side of things , has also attracted interest from politicians and donors			2
according to the @entity72 , the crossing will have trees , plants and even ' intimate walkways ' , as well as a direct link between the @entity77 and @entity78 delighted : artist @entity52 ( left ) , awarded a @entity79 after the @entity55 , has given weight to the proposal suggested 15 years ago by @entity12 ( right ) the project , which is being developed with engineering firm @entity83 , will go ahead only if @entity52 can raise money from private backers and will not receive public funds			1
a trust , set up to oversee the construction , is currently in the process of seeking charitable status , but private donors are said to have offered to foot almost half the bill already			1
desperate to make sure the structure does become a reality , @entity52 has drawn up a specific time scale - seeing construction start in 2015 and end , at the latest , in 2017			1
plan : desperate to make sure the structure becomes a reality , architect @entity100 has a detailed time - scale that ends in 2017 at the latest he told the @entity104 : ' if people want the bridge to happen , then it has to happen now			0
' otherwise , it will just be one of those nice things that did n’t happen			0
' he adds that the flower meadow @entity111 created for the opening ceremony last year has further inspired the project			0
he told the @entity104 : ' what i thought was that of course the venues were impressive , and the @entity118 amazing , but what i wo n’t forget is the wild planting			0
' we are used to quite a harsh experience in the architectural landscape around us			0
often environments do n’t have a human scale , but plants give you that			0
' there is something unpretentious about them — this project will have slugs and worms and autumn smells , rather than grand , @entity136 - like power - planting			0

public consultation opened for aerial oasis from @entity18 to @entity77 after 15 years of *negotiations*
private donors already footed half the *£* *150million* bill for project headed by @entity55 architect @entity52
*tipped* to be @entity38 's answer to the @entity148 , a disused train line transformed into a park
