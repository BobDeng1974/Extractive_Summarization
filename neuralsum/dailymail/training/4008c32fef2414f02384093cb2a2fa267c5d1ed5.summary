@entity0 , 37 , lost her memory after developing encephalitis - inflammation of the brain			1
she is pictured with her daughter , @entity5 , and her husband , @entity6 a mother who lost her memory after being struck down by a life - threatening illness is able to care for her daughter again thanks to dozens of daily @entity11 reminders			1
@entity0 , 37 , lost almost two years of her memory after being diagnosed with encephalitis - inflammation of the brain			1
her memory loss was so severe that while she was in hospital for a month , she did not ask after her two - year - old daughter and even asked whether she was @entity16			1
but her miraculous recovery means she can now care for @entity5 again and has returned to work - with the help of @entity11 reminders that make up for her occasionally unreliable short - term memory			1
up to 10 reminders a day tell her to pack her daughter ’s nursery bag , when she needs to go to work and when to do everything from the washing up to the laundry			2
they also remind her of every family birthday and even her own wedding anniversary			0
mrs @entity0 , from @entity32 , said : ‘ although i remembered my daughter once she came to visit me in hospital , before that i had n’t questioned why she was n’t there and that ’s scary			1
‘ now i ’m over the moon that i ’m back to being a mum and back to work - even if i need a few reminders here and there ! ’ mrs @entity0 ’s terrifying descent to losing her memory started when she woke up feeling unwell one morning in january 2013 and was sent home from work sick			1
the next day her husband @entity6 , 40 , came home to check on her at lunch time but within hours she was struggling to focus and was taken into hospital			1
her husband went home from the hospital to care for their daughter @entity5 , now three , but just a few hours later he was called back to say goodbye as his wife ’s condition had rapidly deteriorated			1
when he arrived , a nurse called the two most recently dialled numbers on his phone to summon his friends for support as doctors were sure mrs @entity0 would not make it through the night			1
amazingly , she survived the night despite being in and out of intensive care and spending more than a week in two drug induced comas			1
her husband was warned she could face severe permanent brain damage			1
mrs @entity0 ’s doctor believes she had an autoimmune encephalitis when her body started producing anti-bodies which attacked her brain			1
encephalitis can have many different causes including an infection and abnormal immune system reactions			2
mrs @entity0 was so ill that doctors warned her husband she might not survive miraculously , mrs @entity0 recovered but she was left with memory problems			1
she has now had to use family photographs to remind her of all the events she has forgotten medical staff tried to help her body fight the disease with a plasma exchange which had dramatic results and after two sessions she was able to sit up and eat a sandwich			0
a plasma exchange , also known as plasmapheresis , is a procedure where a machine is used to separate plasma from the other components of a patient ’s blood			0
during the procedure , the plasma is removed and replaced with a substitute and the red cells , white cells and platelets are returned to the patient			0
encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition that causes inflammation of the brain			1
it usually begins with flu - like symptoms , such as a high temperature and a headache			2
more serious symptoms can then develop			0
these include confusion , disorientation , seizures and changes in personality			0
there are several different types of encephalitis that have different causes			2
the most common are caused by infections or an autoimmune reaction			0
the illness requires urgent treatment - usually in an intensive care unit and about 10 per cent of cases are fatal			2
some people make a full recovery but many experience permanent brain damage			2
this can cause complications such as memory loss , epilepsy , personality changes and fatigue			0
source : @entity133 but when mrs @entity0 woke up there were significant gaps in her memory			1
she had no idea why she was in hospital and for a week she had to be constantly reminded that she ’d had a miscarriage a month before			0
it was only when her husband brought @entity5 to visit her just before she returned home that mrs @entity0 realised she had not once asked after the daughter she had given birth to and looked after for the previous two years			1
she finally left hospital a month after being admitted and has been trying to remember the missing bits of the puzzle ever since			0
as well as her daily reminders , she wrote a diary when she left hospital to document everything she re-learned and to try and make sure she did n’t forget anything again			1
she had to look through photos of family holidays to try and fill in the gaps in her memory and has shocked herself by forgetting the way round @entity32 where she has lived for 18 years			0
sadly , she has had to grieve twice for a friend who she had forgotten had died			0
when mrs @entity0 found a letter from her friend ’s mother thanking her for a donation to a memorial fund , she found herself mourning for the second time			1
but psychometric tests have proved she ’d retained all the necessary information to work as a practice pharmacist and is making a gradual return to her job			0
mrs @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s bizarre that i ’ve remembered some things so well but i ca n’t for the life of me remember some holidays and certain events			2
‘ i ’ve forgotten almost anyone new i ’d met in the last two years as well basic things like where everything was in our house			0
' i ’ve spent months looking for a box of light bulbs that i put in a safe place and now ca n’t remember where i put them			0
mrs @entity0 now keeps a diary to ensure that she does n't forget anything else ‘ i do n’t remember anything about the time i was sick			2
no matter how many times people tell me about it , it still does n’t sink in			0
i do n’t know how it could happen so quickly			0
‘ i really thought of myself as very clued up on even the most obscure medical conditions but i ’d never even heard of encephalitis			0
‘ i do n’t think i ’ll ever forget the word now ! ’ mr @entity194 , an accountant , said : ‘ @entity0 had always been a list maker but now it ’s that with bells on ! ‘ we ’re just trying to get back to life that ’s as normal as possible with the almost constant alarms			2
‘ it was awful when she first went into hospital and she was hooked up to machines with tubes to help her breathe and eat			0
‘ she looked like she was barely alive - i did n’t know how that could be			0
‘ because you do n’t have a big list of all the things you know , once she came back from hospital she just gradually realised what she had forgotten and we had to piece her memory back together			2
‘ @entity0 was in bits when she re-realised that her friend had died			2
but we had already grieved once			0
‘ when she came out of hospital it was n’t the @entity0 that went in , and it was really difficult because she did n’t remember much of what we had shared together , but thankfully that ’s gradually come back and we ’re a couple like we were			1
’ dr @entity221 , chief executive of the @entity222 said : ‘ there are around 6,000 new cases of encephalitis diagnosed in @entity226 each year alone and although there are many different outcomes , depending on how the individual was affected , memory loss can be severe			1
