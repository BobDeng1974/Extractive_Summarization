a woman treated for a recurring superbug infection with a stool transplant from an overweight donor rapidly gained weight afterwards , it has emerged			1
the female patient then became obese , according to experts who reviewed her case			0
faecal microbiota transplant ( @entity10 ) is a promising treatment for relapsing @entity12 difficile infections			1
the bacterial infection affects the digestive system , and often those who have been treated with antibiotics			2
in severe cases , the infection can cause life - threatening complications			0
a woman who underwent a faecal transplant to help cure her recurring c - difficile infections gained more than three stone in the months after the procedure , where stools from an overweight donor were transferred into her gut , in a bid to restore ' good ' bacteria ( picture is posed by models ) the aim of a faecal transplant is to replace ' good ' bacteria in the gut that has been killed or suppressed			1
this balances out the ' bad'bacteria , specifically @entity37 , that are overpopulating the colon			0
however the new report suggests clinicians should avoid selecting stool donors who are overweight			0
and doctors say it raises questions about the role of gut bacteria in metabolism and health			2
at the time of the patient 's faecal transplant in 2011 , her weight was stable at nine - and - a - half stone , and her body mass index ( @entity56 ) was a borderline 26 ( a healthy @entity56 is classed as a up to 25 )			1
then 32 years old , the woman had always been of ' normal weight ' , according to the case report			2
the transplant used donor stools from the woman 's overweight but otherwise healthy teenage daughter			1
it was administered via a colonoscopy to restore a healthy balance of bacteria in the woman 's gut , curing her c - diff infection			1
but 16 months after the procedure , the woman 's weight rose to 12 stone and her @entity56 increased to 33 - meeting the medical criteria for obesity			1
faecal microbiota transplant ( @entity10 ) is a procedure where faecal matter , or stools , is collected from a donor			1
it is then mixed with saline before being transplanted into a patient by colonoscopy , endoscopy or enema			0
the aim is to replace ' good ' bacteria in the gut that has been killed or suppressed , usually by the use of antibiotics , leaving ' bad'bacteria , specifically @entity37 , to overpopulate the colon			2
the infection can cause complications often resulting in debilitating diarrhoea , which in some cases proves fatal			0
the woman 's weight gain continued , despite doctors placing her on a medically supervised liquid protein diet and exercise regime			2
sustained efforts to diet and exercise regularly failed to achieve any weight loss			0
three years after her transplant the woman weighed 12 - and - a - half stone , and her @entity56 reached 34.5			1
specialists examining her case said she remains clinically obese today			0
@entity114 , from the @entity112 of @entity113 said : ' we 're questioning whether there was something in the faecal transplant , whether some of those " good " bacteria we transferred may have had an impact on her metabolism in a negative way			1
' the link is supported by past animal studies looking at bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and weight			0
after transferring gut bacteria from obese mice into animals of a normal weight , scientists noted a marked increase in fat			0
in light of the woman 's case , the authors of the report recommend selecting stool donors who are not overweight			1
but they noted the transplant was not the only possible cause of the patient 's weight gain			0
the woman weighed a stable nine - and - a - half stone before the procedure and had a @entity56 of 26			1
but within 176 months her weight rose to 12 stone and @entity56 to 33 - making her medically obese			1
two years after the operation the woman weighed 12 - and - a - half stone and her @entity56 was 34.5 ( file picture ) they said in addition to treatment for c - diff , the woman had also been treated with several antibiotics for helicobacter pylori infection			1
other possible contributing factors in the woman 's weight gain include the resolution of her c - diff infection , genetic factors , ageing , and stress related to illness			2
however , as noted , the patient had never been overweight before			0
@entity171 and @entity172 , of @entity173 , said the case raises many questions about donor selection and highlights the importance of studying long - term outcomes of faecal transplants			2
in a related editorial , they said : ' careful study of @entity10 will advance knowledge about safe manipulation of the gut microbiota			0
' ultimately , of course , it is hoped that @entity10 studies will lead to identification of defined mixtures of beneficial bacteria that can be cultured , manufactured , and administered to improve human health			0
' the report was published in the new journal @entity195 .			0

32 - year - old woman had the faecal transplant in 2011 after suffering recurring @entity12 difficile infections - which affect the digestive system
procedure uses donor stools to *introduce* ' good ' bacteria to the gut
prior to op woman weighed a stable 9 and a half stone , her @entity56 was 26
16 months later she weighed 12st and her @entity56 rose to 33 - meeting the medical criteria for obesity
three years after transplant she weighed 12 and a half stone , @entity56 was 34.5
diets and exercise did *n't* help , leading experts to question whether the ' good ' bacteria *introduce*d negatively affected the woman 's metabolism
warned against using overweight donors for *future* faecal transplant ops
