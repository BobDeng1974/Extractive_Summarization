work and pensions secretary @entity103 said the demand was ' absurd '			0
@entity46 minister @entity103 said mr @entity86 's demand for people to get a receipt for someone charging £ 10 to trim a hedge was ' absurd ' he said : ' i do n't think anybody in the country probably does that unless they sit down and they do it as part of a process ; in other words , if you are employing somebody in which the objective is paying them cash as a process of your business , then of course i suspect most businesses do keep some kind of record , that 's the right thing to do			1
' but if you have a one - off payment for something and you pay cash , i should n't think anybody in the country does that necessarily ... what it exemplifies is @entity48 's complete lack of understanding about how business works and , actually , how people get by			2
' he told @entity144 : ' here we have a man that would be the chancellor who is wandering around saying @entity149 is going to watch you carefully , that if you do any cash transactions and do n't keep receipts , somehow they are going to punish you			0

' asked whether he himself followed that rule , he said : ' absolutely			0
that 's because i am the shadow chancellor and i 'm extremely careful about these things			0
' over my life , have i ever given people a tenner and not given a receipt for it ? probably yes			0
but he had not done so ' since i have been involved in politics and @entity192 matters '			0
mr @entity86 said : ' it 's not your job to pay their taxes for them and i think most people you give a tenner to are not going to be vat - registered			2
' they 've got the legal obligation to make sure they pay their taxes if it 's that kind of transaction - but i think the sensible thing for anybody is that you 've got a record of it and you 've done it properly			0
