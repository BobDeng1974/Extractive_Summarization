a survey of more than 13 000 young adults aged 15 – 24 in the @entity187 , found that 8 per cent had tried a new psychoactive substance at least once , with 3 per cent using them in the last year			2
only last august , father - of - three @entity190 , 33 , from @entity191 , @entity192 , passed away at @entity193 in @entity194 following a five - month addiction to new psychoactive substances ( @entity152 ) , which caused him severe heart problems			0

they include psychoactive substances ( @entity152 ) and 6 - @entity264 , known commonly as @entity265			0
those attempts have now turned into a cat and mouse game with legislators , with chemists synthesising new substances faster them @entity271 can ban them , spawning a whole industry to feed @entity32 's hunger for mind - altering substances			0
however , unlike drugs which have been around for years and for which risks are generally well known , the long term - and indeed short term - risks many of these new substances are still a mystery .			0
