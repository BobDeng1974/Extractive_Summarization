by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 02:24 est , 15 may 2013 critic : @entity2 attacked plans to install one of the @entity6 's largest solar farms in the @entity8 countryside he has spent the past few years championing the great @entity6 countryside			1
so when developers announced plans for an enormous solar power farm near the home of @entity2 , they should have expected a fight			1
the 59 - year - old comedian yesterday attacked proposals for a £ 20million renewable energy plant in the area of @entity8 where he lives with his family			1
calling the plans ‘ cavalier ’ and ‘ willy - nilly ’ , he said they would ruin the unspoilt rural area for generations to come			1
he is the latest personality to speak out over so - called ‘ green ’ initiatives to build solar and wind farms in rural beauty spots			1
‘ this sort of planning can not be done in this ad hoc way , ’ he said			2
‘ they need a much more considered approach			2
' this is an area of outstanding natural beauty			2
we can not license an industrial plant to be built willy - nilly on any farm			1
‘ to be this cavalier with this sort of development is foolish			2
we will be despoiling the countryside for limited results			2
‘ if areas as beautiful as this can be built over so quickly , this is something we will live to regret			2
’ @entity2 made his name in 1980s satirical comedy not the @entity51 , but is now better known for his love of rural @entity6 , most recently with last year ’s documentary series @entity6 ’s @entity54			0
his series @entity56 highlighted the treasures of the @entity59 lives next to the picturesque @entity61 river at @entity62 , around two miles from the site of the proposed solar power farm			1
the solar panels , which would provide power for up to 5,400 homes , would occupy 94 acres of farmland beside the @entity70 beauty spot at @entity71 near @entity72			1
the developers said they chose the site because it was not near to houses – but locals have pointed out that it would be visible from popular rambling routes			0
@entity2 said he is not against renewable energy in principle , but believed such developments should not be approved at the cost of ruining areas of natural beauty			0
protesting plans : the new £ 20m plant , which will prevent up to 7,740 tons of co2 emissions annually , is to be build near @entity2 ' home in @entity62 , @entity8 he added : ‘ filling an area the size of 50 football pitches – which is open to view on three sides from public rights of way – with 72,000 three - metre high plastic panels simply can not be a sensible way to use our best - quality agricultural land in a highly attractive landscape			1
‘ the area is heavily used for leisure and recreation and very close to @entity70			0
there are brownfield sites five miles away that would be better suited			0
‘ i am totally opposed to it			0
i hope the council sees sense and opposes it			0
’ last year he criticised the ‘ hypocrisy ’ of wind farms , calling them ‘ green tokenism ’			0
@entity115 is due to consider the plans for the solar farm , which will prevent up to 7,740 tons of co2 emissions annually , today			1
the area is designated by the council as a special landscape area and officers are recommending that a decision should not be made until june 12			0
@entity124 , commercial director of green energy firm @entity125 which wants to build the farm , said : ‘ i am surprised @entity2 does not support the plans			1
‘ if he wants people to buy his dvds , they will need electricity to play them and we have a problem in this country with many power stations about to reach the end of their lives			0
we now have an opportunity for renewable energy in this country			0
’ he said the site was ‘ particularly suitable ’ , adding : ‘ the field would be fully screened from the residents ’ visibility and a significant amount of electricity would be supplied to them			0

comedian call plans for solar plant near his @entity8 home ' willy - nilly '
