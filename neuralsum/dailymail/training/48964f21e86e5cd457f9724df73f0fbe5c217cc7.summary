by @entity0 , @entity1 editor takeaways are selling lamb dishes containing unidentified meats , raising fears that flesh from rats , dogs and cats could be in our curries and kebabs			1
investigators have been analysing fast food all over @entity16 and found that lamb had routinely been replaced with pork , beef , chicken , turkey and what could be vermin or pets , it was revealed today			0
the studies – one by the @entity26 and another by consumer group which ? – come more than a year after the supermarket horsemeat scandal and suggest food fraud is still rife on the high street			2
the which ? analysis of 60 lamb dishes found 29 were ' suspect ' , 17 contained different meats , seven contained no lamb at all and five had meat that could not be identified			1
some takeaways are routinely selling ' lamb ' curries containing no lamb , according to two major studies @entity16 favourite : the kebab is a takeaway staple in the @entity16 , but analysis has found that some contained unidentified meats @entity49 dishes are particularly vulnerable to fraud because the meat is expensive , meaning takeaways might replace it with poor quality , cheaper cuts of beef , chicken and turkey			1
the @entity26 , which is responsible for food hygiene and safety in the @entity16 , looked at council surveys of 145 lamb takeaway meals sold across the country between july and december last year			1
of these 43 ( 30 per cent ) contained other types of meat , such as beef and chicken , as well as lamb , or no lamb at all			1
almost one in five meals contained only beef			2
the separate which ? research tested 30 takeaway lamb curries and 30 minced lamb kebabs from restaurants in @entity77 and @entity78			2
it found 24 dishes ( 40 per cent ) had a mixture of meats or no lamb			1
seven , or more than one in ten , contained only beef			0
in five of the dishes sampled , the meat could not be identified most worryingly , the meat in five of the samples could not be identified			1
one explanation is that it was overcooked or re-cooked , but there is a possibility it was from an animal that is not normally eaten in the @entity16			0
the findings will be especially upsetting to many families of @entity97 or @entity98 faith , who do not eat beef for religious reasons			0
professor @entity102 , director of the @entity103 who was appointed by the government to come up with a series of recommendations to tackle food fraud in response to the horsemeat scandal , said : ‘ the survey results come as no great surprise to me			0
whenever issues about food contamination and adulteration are looked for in a serious way they are found			0
‘ without rigorous monitoring programmes in place cheats will always try to take advantage of @entity121 need to develop systems in the @entity16 that deter fraud			0
’ @entity124 , the @entity26 ’s chief operating officer , insisted the watchdog is taking action to crack down on food fraud			2
in response to the findings , the @entity26 has threatened the businesses involved with fines of up to £ 5,000			2
it has also asked local councils to launch a major sampling programme of lamb dishes across 300 takeaways to bring about prosecutions of rogue traders			1
mr @entity124 said : ‘ the recurring nature of the problem shows there needs to be a renewed effort to tackle it			0
the testing we have announced today will focus the efforts of enforcement officers and raise awareness among food businesses of the action they face for defrauding consumers			0

studies find some takeaways selling lamb dishes with other types of meat
the @entity26 say 30 per cent of meals analysed contained other meats

in five of the samples , the meat could not be identified
