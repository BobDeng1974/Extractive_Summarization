@entity1 ’s fight on five fronts - @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and with referees - goes on			2
the tension is mounting in this absorbing title race and anyone who witnessed the @entity13 manager ’s unnecessary assassination of the match official ’s performance recognised some familiar signs			1
stress level : off the scale			0
@entity13 playmaker @entity26 jumps in the air after scoring his side 's equaliser just before the interval hazard is mobbed by his @entity13 team - mates after scoring his seventh @entity3 goal of the season @entity35 raced past @entity13 's defence before lifting the ball over @entity13 goalkeeper @entity38 @entity35 followed up his goal against @entity40 with a lobbed effort against league leaders @entity13 @entity43 : @entity44 6 ; @entity45 6 ( @entity46 62 , 6 ) , @entity47 7 , @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 6 ; @entity50 6.5 , @entity51 6.5 ; @entity52 6 ( @entity53 77 , 6 ) , @entity35 7 , @entity54 7 ( @entity55 58 , 6 ) ; @entity56 6 subs : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 scorer : @entity35 17 sent off : @entity50			1
manager : @entity63 7 @entity13 : @entity38 6 ; @entity64 6 , @entity65 6 , @entity66 6 , @entity67 6 ; @entity68 5.5 ( @entity69 74 ) , @entity70 6 ; @entity71 4 , @entity72 7 , @entity26 7.5 ; costa 6 ( @entity73 89 )			1
subs : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity73 , @entity78 scorer : hazard 45 booked : @entity70 , @entity72 manager : @entity1 : 6 referee : @entity23 6 @entity26 levelled the scoring in the 45th minute - click here to see more of our brilliant @entity84 ' there is a campaign - not against me , but against @entity13 , ’ he whined , after @entity72 was felled by @entity43 ’s rookie left back @entity49 inside the penalty area with the score at 1 - 1			1
the brutal truth is @entity1 flipped his lid here , losing control of his emotions at a time when he was unaware @entity97 had equalised at @entity98			0
if only he had known			0
to think it had all been going so sweetly , @entity13 serenely closing in on their fourth @entity3 title when they moved nine points ahead of @entity98 in november			1
@entity1 barely mentioned a word of the game , other than to hiss repeatedly when he was quizzed about @entity23 ’s failure to award @entity13 a 55th - minute penalty			1
@entity72 was booked for simulation			0
it was , indeed , a ridiculous decision because @entity49 took the attacker ’s legs from under him and appeared to be blocking his path with an arm at the same time			0
it should have been a penalty , but then @entity63 could legitimately argue that @entity13 still had another 35 minutes to eke out a winner			1
in the end , given @entity116 ’ equaliser at the @entity117 , they got away with it			2
@entity13 star @entity120 tries to shoot as three @entity43 defenders attempt to block his effort this was classic @entity1 , setting up a bigger diversion than the cones being laid out on that irksome @entity126 last night , in a resilient attempt to avoid a heavy - duty inquest into his side ’s performance			1
he can be thankful that @entity98 are still three points behind them after they were pegged back by @entity97			0
still , this was a big slip			0
@entity43 were excellent , barely showing signs of any fatigue after their purposeful 3 - 1 victory at @entity40 on @entity137			1
here they scored early on , taking the lead when @entity54 ’s delightful lob sent @entity35 in the clear			1
the @entity43 forward got his chance because @entity13 ’s defensive line was so high and @entity66 made a rare error by appealing for offside			1
after the outstanding season he has had , the @entity13 captain is entitled to make one mistake			2
yet , it was a significant one			0
@entity35 went on to beat the on - rushing figure of @entity38 and send this place into raptures			1
@entity43 goalkeeper @entity44 attempts save @entity26 's low shot but the ball nestles into the bottom corner of the net hazard celebrates after scoring past @entity44 while @entity43 stars @entity51 and @entity50 look dejected @entity72 goes down in the penalty area after a challenge by @entity43 youngster @entity49 @entity43 fans in every area of the ground were hugging each other			1
and there was a long smouldering cuddle between @entity54 and @entity63 on the sidelines			0
what joy for the home fans			0
@entity63 responded to the rhythmic chants from all four corners of @entity170 ’s as they sang his name after @entity35 ’s opener			2
he returned a cheery wave			0
@entity54 has seven assists now , a decent haul for a player who always seems to put in a shift down the left flank			0
this is the first time @entity13 have conceded in the league since @entity185 ’s double sealed @entity184 ’s win at @entity186 on december 6			2
they have had a good run for their money			0
@entity43 cashed in first , taking the lead and prodding @entity13 into action			1
they had to do something about it			0
they have the same @entity196 schedule as every other team , except they play with the added pressure that every team wants to put one over on them			0
@entity72 was booked by @entity3 official @entity23 for an apparent dive during the second half the @entity13 midfielder reacts as referee @entity23 shows him a yellow card during the match at @entity170 's @entity72 looks dejected as he lays on the turf at @entity170 's during his side 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity43 @entity43 were hungry , full of willing runners in the centre of midfield			1
@entity50 , at least until he was correctly dismissed for a second booking for repeatedly chopping @entity26 , was the pick of the bunch			1
the one man @entity43 could not afford to take their eye off was @entity72			2
remember the backspin @entity218 put on the ball for @entity220 to run on to and score at @entity221 in the @entity4 a couple of months ago ? there were shades of that here , as @entity72 put hazard in with a wonderful chip			2
the @entity228 took a touch past @entity45 , wrong - footed the rest of the @entity43 defence and curled the equaliser beyond @entity44			1
it was @entity26 ’s first goal on his travels since january , against @entity235 , but it was worth the wait			2
hazard holds off @entity43 defender @entity45 as he attempts to maintain possession for his side @entity50 walks off the pitch after being shown a second yellow card by referee @entity23 @entity243 substitute @entity69 stretches for the ball but he is unable to score past the @entity245 @entity67 , @entity246 and @entity72 speak to referee @entity23 at the end of the @entity3 encounter at the break fall - guy @entity71 made way for @entity246 to shake up @entity13 ’s attack			1
at times he tortured the @entity43 defence			2
there were some big misses in the second half , particularly when @entity69 , another substitute , miscued his pass as @entity120 was waiting to score from close - range			0
then @entity120 slipped when @entity26 put himself in a goalscoring position			2
the only thing that did was @entity23 ’s whistle , calling @entity72 to attention when he went down under @entity49 ’s clumsy challenge			0
he was harshly booked , the inevitable conclusion these days when a referee rules in favour of the defender			0
‘ my team is clean , ’ added @entity1			0
yes , but sometimes you play dirty , @entity1			0
@entity38 shakes hands with opposite number forster following the 1 - 1 draw @entity13 captain @entity66 applauds the travelling @entity243 fans after the final whistle @entity1 and @entity63 put their friendship to one side during the @entity3 clash at @entity170 's			1

@entity35 opened the scoring in the 17th minute by chipping the ball over @entity38
@entity13 playmaker @entity26 *grabbed* an equaliser just before the interval
@entity43 were reduced to 10 men in the closing stages as @entity50 picked up a second yellow card
