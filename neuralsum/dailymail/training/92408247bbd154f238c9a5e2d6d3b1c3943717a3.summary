@entity2 prices have begun rising again , hitting a new record high of Â£ 189,333 one average , @entity0 revealed today			1
property values grew by 0.5 per cent in october , reversing a 0.1 per cent month - on - month fall seen in september			1
but the year - on - year pace of house price growth has been slowing for two months in a row , and @entity0 said that the housing market does appear to have lost momentum			1
values lifted by 9.0 per cent year - on - year in october , drifting down from a 9.4 per cent annual uplift in september			2
year - on - year house price growth had consistently been in double digits over the summer as house prices hit a string of new all - time highs			2
typical @entity19 house prices surpassed their 2007 peak in cash terms in may this year and between then and august they had hit a run of new records , before falling back slightly in september and then recovering to a fresh peak this month			2
it suggests buyers have returned to the market after the summer break			2
@entity29 , @entity0 's chief economist , said : ' a variety of indicators suggest that the market has lost momentum			1
' the number of mortgages approved for house purchase in september was almost 20 per cent below the level prevailing at the start of the year			0
' he pointed to some recent studies which have suggested that interest from prospective house hunters is dropping off and said that activity may soften further in the near - term , particularly in @entity45			0
mr @entity29 said that with mortgage rates having fallen to rock bottom levels , the typical mortgage payment as a share of someone 's take home pay remains close to the long - term average , despite house prices being at an all - time high			0
house prices rose by 9.0 per cent year - on - year in october , drifting down from a 9.4 per cent annual uplift in september in a sign of what is to come , the @entity55 reported yesterday that the number of mortgage approvals made to home buyers fell to a 14 - month low in september			1
some experts have said this is evidence of the market becoming steadier after a strong burst of housing market activity seen earlier this year			1
but other commentators have predicted that with the wider economy still picking up , the weaker patch of mortgage approvals will not last for long			0
stricter mortgage lending rules came into force earlier this year which caused some disruption to the market , but in recent weeks there have been signs of lenders gaining a stronger appetite to do business and slashing the mortgage rates on offer in attempts to meet end - of - year lending targets			0
expectations about the prospect of a rise in the @entity55 base rate from its historic 0.5 per cent low , pushing up borrowing costs , also appear to have been pushed back			0
the @entity55 's chief economist @entity87 recently indicated that there will be no hike until well into next year			0
@entity90 , chief @entity19 and @entity92 economist for @entity93 , said : ' the @entity0 data for october are consistent with our view that house prices will keep on rising but at a more restrained rate			1
' even so , buyer interest in houses is unlikely to fall away with appreciable support is likely to come from elevated consumer confidence , markedly rising employment , and still low mortgage interest rates , especially as they now look unlikely to rise before mid- 2015			0
