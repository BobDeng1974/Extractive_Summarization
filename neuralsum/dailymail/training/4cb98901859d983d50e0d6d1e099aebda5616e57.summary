@entity0 saved an early penalty to help earn @entity2 a point in what must rate as one of the lowest quality games of this @entity7 season so far - but @entity2 have nonetheless fallen into the relegation zone despite getting something from the game			1
their failure to win , combined with @entity13 beating @entity14 , means they drop a place and into the bottom three			1
@entity18 , who were if anything even less threatening than @entity2 , remain very much in trouble			1
it would n’t be harsh on either to club to say they ’ve been poor this season and are both in serious danger of a season - long relegation scrap			0
so the prospect of brilliant entertainment was always remote between teams low on confidence and in fear of getting dragged into the drop zone			2

6.5 @entity88 man : @entity0 ratings by @entity90 at the @entity53 click here for all the stats and heat maps from @entity53 including @entity2 goalkeeprt @entity0 who was man of the match in a man - of - the - match display ( above ) ‘ we lacked that cutting edge in the final third , ’ said @entity2 ’s manager @entity67 , whose team had only two shots on target			1
‘ it was one of those frustrating days			0
you take a point and move on			0
’ he singled out @entity0 for praise			2
the @entity106 goalkeeper saved an early penalty from @entity44 , albeit a poorly taken one , and later thwarted @entity51 with a brilliant leap			1
‘ the save from @entity51 was arguably the save of the season , ’ @entity67 said			0
he added that the expectation on @entity2 to stay up is ‘ unbelievable ’ , but repeated that they are still new to this division			2
‘ i still think we ’ve got enough [ quality ] in the squad to see us through , ’ he said			0
@entity49 ( left ) is in the thick of the action again as he challenges @entity18 's @entity118 for possession @entity2 centre back @entity54 ( right ) pulls back @entity39 as the @entity18 frontrman strides forward @entity2 manager @entity67 contests a decision from the sideline during a scoreless opening 45 minutes of action @entity51 ( left ) heads the ball under pressure from former @entity128 defender @entity54 @entity129 miles @entity2 112.0 69.6 @entity59 90 12.0 7.4 @entity43 90 11.7 7.2 @entity49 90 10.9 6.8 @entity18 109.3 67.9 @entity76 90 11.5 7.1 @entity44 90 11.0 6.8 @entity78 90 10.9 6.8 @entity2 started the day in the more lowly position in the table , in 17th place with 12 points but @entity18 were only one place and one point higher			1
@entity2 came into this with just one win in their league 13 league games - and only six in the entire calendar year			2
@entity18 kicked off on the back of four straight defeats and one win in eight			2
the @entity18 last defeat was at home to @entity146 in midweek and @entity35 made four changes to his starting xi to face @entity2			1
@entity150 , @entity83 and @entity37 were all benched while @entity151 is out injured			0
in came @entity73 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity78			0
@entity2 ended a four - game losing run of their own in midweek by squeaking a draw at @entity156 and @entity67 made two changes from that draw			1
@entity159 and @entity69 were out injurted and benched respectively , replaced by @entity64 - back after paternity leave , of sorts - and @entity63			1
the first half of this match was so poor and light on chances that there was plenty of time to discuss the ins and outs of @entity172 paternity leave with the locals			1
@entity67 had pronounced himself surprised when @entity64 needed to go back to @entity174 but apparently local laws there meant his partner needed the baby ’s father with her in order to bring their new child out of the country			2
in other local gossip , on an afternoon when it was necessary to find something interesting to supplement the football , @entity2 are being investigated by @entity188 for alleged breaches of @entity190 rules			2
they ’re under the microscope because of losses last least and because they played in @entity188 this season			0
what a long , long time ago that seems now			0
@entity2 's @entity58 ( right ) holds off @entity18 's @entity79 as both sides chase the opening goal @entity2 's @entity56 ( centre ) has eyes for the ball as @entity18 's @entity201 ( right ) controls possession it ’s not quite accurate to say nothing whatsoever of any interest happened in the first half but suffice to say that the only shot on target was a penalty - and it was saved			1
@entity18 thought they should have had a spot kick in the third minute when @entity39 was tugged by @entity54 but referee @entity210 gave nothing , either because he did n’t see it , or thought it was a marginal offence outside the box			1
@entity87 did award a penalty a few minutes later , and rightly so , when @entity39 was felled by @entity43 , who wrestled him to the ground			1
@entity44 stepped up for the visitors and hit his effort not particularly hard , leaving @entity0 with a much easier job of a save than should have been the case			1
@entity18 had a third penalty shout of the game in the opening 11 minutes when @entity118 claimed his shot had been deliverately handled by @entity49			1
but @entity87 said it was a case of ball to hand and that looked to be the right call with the naked eye			0
to describe anything else in the first half as a ‘ chance ’ would be to overstate the case of the few sporadic moments of ‘ threat ’			0
@entity58 and @entity63 exchanged passes that might have led to something but that moved as cut off and the ball was cleared by @entity74			0
and @entity59 had a shot blocked by @entity73			0
things got better in the second half - but not by much			0
@entity64 shot wide three minutes after the break , and then team - mate @entity63 did the same			2
then with nearly an hour gone came the best chance since the penalty when @entity43 crossed to @entity61 , who placed a headed effort on target , low and right , only to see @entity71 dive and save it			1
@entity18 then had their best opportunity since the penalty as @entity51 won a free kick from a foul by @entity49 and cracked it towards goal from the left of the ‘ d ’			1
@entity0 made a flying save to deny him			0
at the other end , @entity64 got on the end of a free kick from @entity57 but could only flash his header wide			0
@entity2 increasingly took the game to @entity18 , finally finding some urgency			1
but it was took little , too late .			0

@entity18 's @entity44 misses penalty in the eighth minute
@entity0 saved @entity44 ' attempt to keep his side in the game
penalty was awarded after @entity39 was *tripped* in the box by @entity43
@entity64 returned to @entity2 squad after missing two matches on paternity leave in @entity172
@entity2 drop down into relegation zone after @entity13 's *victory* at @entity14
