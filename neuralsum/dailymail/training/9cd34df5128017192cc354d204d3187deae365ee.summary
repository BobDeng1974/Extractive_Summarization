by @entity0 published : 12:05 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 13:13 est , 18 june 2012 far from enjoying the quiet of the countryside , what farmyard animals really want to hear is a good rock song from the likes of @entity7 and @entity8 - preferably on @entity9			1
a survey carried out by @entity11 showed 77 per cent of farmers in the east of @entity14 play music or sing to their livestock , tipping @entity9 as the most popular radio station for animals , followed by @entity20			2
among the artists to have found a new fan base in pigs and cows are @entity25 , @entity8 , @entity26 and @entity27 , according to farmers			1
farmers have said livestock enjoy listening to rock music , preferably on @entity9 they also admitted to singing hymns , rugby songs and piggy nursery rhymes to keep their animals relaxed			1
but it is n't just the sound of music that puts the farm animals in a good mood			2
the research found livestock also enjoyed keeping up to date with current affairs and sport from @entity45 and @entity47 's today programme			1
it follows research from @entity50 in @entity51 which found that playing background music can have a positive effect on sows and piglets by increasing suckling and making mothers more playful			0
@entity8 is a top choice to keep animals happy @entity60 of @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 , has taken the theory one step further and has his own house band the @entity67			1
he said : ' we often sit on the hay bales , singing and strumming to our @entity11 pigs and i ’m convinced they love it			0
' and when the bands not playing we have music on all the time , coming from the tractors or my truck			0
' it ’s really important to be relaxed and calm around farm animals because they respond to your mood and in turn become more chilled out too			2
' music and also talking to our animals is a key part of that			0
i chat away to my breeding sows all the time , although the piglets are often too busy to stay still long enough to listen			0
' the survey found that more than half of farmers , 59 per cent , talk to their animals with hot topics including the weather and how they are feeling			0
tracks by @entity26 also proved to be a hit among the herds @entity11 farm animal scientist , dr @entity101 , said : ' chatting to farm animals may sound daft but there is a clear welfare message behind @entity11 ’s survey			1
' the farmers said that their animals are more content , relaxed and calm when they interact with them in this way			0
' like our pets , farm animals are intelligent , sentient beings and respond well to positive interaction			0
' @entity25 ' someone like moo ' please do n't stop the @entity116 an @entity117 who let the @entity119 out @entity120 should @entity121 @entity123 's @entity122 barn to @entity125 go your @entity126 @entity128 anything by @entity130 @entity131 and @entity132 ... and of course , anything by @entity135 !			1
