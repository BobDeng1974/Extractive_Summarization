@entity0 , pictured outside court , has been cleared of killing @entity2 and @entity3 , both 86 a young hairdresser who mowed down and killed an elderly couple while on her @entity6 at the wheel has been cleared of causing death by dangerous driving			1
@entity0 , 21 , was on her way to see her boyfriend when she knocked over and killed @entity2 and @entity3 , both 86 , on a poorly - lit road near their home in @entity15 , @entity16			1
now the devastated family of the elderly couple claim ' justice has not been done ' after @entity0 was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving while on her @entity6			1
the prosecution had alleged that ms @entity0 had been distracted by her phone but she told the jury at @entity24 that she began her call in a lay - by and switched to hands - free mode			1
she broke down as she told the jury that she only saw ' a flash of colour ' before hitting the couple , who were walking arm in arm through through the village on their evening stroll			2
her trial also heard evidence from road crash expert @entity38 , who said that the collision was unavoidable because @entity41 and mrs @entity3 were obscured by a passing car as they crossed the road			1
mr @entity38 , a former @entity45 officer , said : ' it is possible that both views [ of ms @entity0 and the @entity48 ] were obstructed by that car			2
' you would have got glare from the headlights ... anything behind an approaching vehicle becomes very difficult to see			0
' @entity24 has been told that @entity0 spent 18 minutes of her 20 minute drive making a series of phone calls			1
but the hairdresser , who was wearing slippers at the time of the accident , denied making three telephone calls while driving			0
@entity0 told the court : ' i was driving and i remember seeing on my driver 's side the colour of something			2
' before i could get my mind to function something hit my windscreen and i slammed on my brakes			0
@entity3 ( left ) and @entity73 ( right ) had been married for 54 years when they went for an evening stroll in november 2013 and were mowed down by @entity0 in her car ' i remember getting out of the car and grabbing my @entity6 and asked my @entity78 [ grandfather ] to help me			1
at first i thought it was an animal because you do n't expect it to be a human			0
' @entity0 said there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision after the elderly couple ' came out of nowhere '			1
she said : ' i was driving at 30mph and i was looking straight ahead of me			0
i was driving carefully and responsibly			0
it was no different to listening to the radio or chatting to a passenger			0
' @entity0 said she put her grandfather on speaker phone after talking to him for around eight minutes while pulled over and was still listening to him when the crash occurred			1
but @entity0 could not explain how cell site analysis of her phone showed it moving while engaged in a six minute phone call with her father at the start of her journey			1
she also could not account for how she received a text message from her boyfriend in the village where she struck the couple when she had told police she would have been pulled over miles further back while stationary and speaking on the phone to her grandmother when it arrived			1
@entity0 was accused of being distracted whilst using her @entity6 behind the wheel , but she claimed that she had started her call while stationary and switched to hands - free mode before driving @entity0 said there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision after the elderly couple ' came out of nowhere ' prosecutor @entity115 said : ' she was grossly distracted by her telephone			1
' she was n't paying proper attention to her driving - which ultimately caused the deaths of two elderly people - because a telephone call was far more important			2
' retired @entity122 airman @entity2 and teacher @entity3 met on a blind date and were married for 54 years before the tragedy on november 13 , 2013			1
mrs @entity3 died of her ' massive injuries ' in the @entity126 just a few hours after the collision			2
mr @entity73 was too weak to undergo surgery to treat the multiple fractures , lacerations and deep bruising he suffered , and he died in the same hospital six days later			0
@entity0 broke down as the verdict was read in court today , however , the family of the @entity133 say they are ' devastated ' with the not guilty verdict and are calling on drivers to not drive and use their phones @entity0 , of @entity139 , @entity140 , was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving and a lesser charge of causing death by careless driving , after a jury took eight hours of deliberation			1
she broke down in tears as the verdict came in and later refused to speak to reporters as she walked free from court and tried to hide her face from photographers as she left			2
the @entity48 daughter , @entity153 , said her family was ' shocked ' and devastated by the not guilty verdict			2
speaking on the steps of @entity24 , she said : ' we are utterly devastated			0
we are shocked by the not guilty verdict			0
' for our beloved parents we feel that justice has not been done			0
we will never come to terms as to why these gentle souls lost their lives in such a brutal and violent way			0
the crash happened on a quiet 30mph road in the village of @entity15 , near @entity166 , @entity16 ( pictured ) a tearful mrs @entity167 , who was flanked by sister @entity170 , added that her family wanted the use of mobile phones when driving , even on hands - free , to be as unacceptable as drink - driving			1
' the only possible good that comes come out of this is to change the universal acceptance of the use of mobile phones while driving			0
' we would like public opinion to think of this in the same way as drink driving			0
mobile phones - whether hands free or not - means that people are not in control of the car			2
' sanctions should be considerably higher and more strictly enforced			0
for our family this is a wholly unacceptable outcome			0
