the @entity0 last night issued an ‘ unprecedented ’ plea to the nation to ‘ come together ’ and strive for a truly united kingdom			1
from @entity4 , she acknowledged the rancour of recent days but urged people to put aside their ‘ strongly - held ’ opinions for the sake of unity			1
her statement , issued after @entity12 leader @entity11 resigned , was also a clear message to politicians trying to appease voters on both sides of the border			2
the @entity0 made clear her own deep - seated affection for the @entity21 , adding : ‘ my family and i will do all we can to help and support you			1
’ the 88 - year - old monarch had resisted being drawn into the referendum debate , and senior royal sources said it was an ‘ unprecedented statement for an unprecedented time in our country ’s history ’			2
entitled ‘ a statement from her majesty @entity0 ’ , and signed @entity50 , it read : ‘ after many months of discussion , debate , and careful thought , we now know the outcome of the @entity58 , and it is a result that all of us throughout the @entity59 will respect			1
for many in @entity21 and elsewhere today , there will be strong feelings and contrasting emotions – among family , friends and neighbours			1
the queen is said to look forward to her annual retreat to @entity4 and was concerned over independence ‘ that , of course , is the nature of the robust democratic tradition we enjoy in this country			2
‘ but i have no doubt that these emotions will be tempered by an understanding of the feelings of others			2
‘ now , as we move forward , we should remember that despite the range of views that have been expressed , we have in common an enduring love of @entity21 , which is one of the things that helps to unite us all			2
' knowing the people of @entity21 as i do , i have no doubt that @entity21 , like others throughout the @entity59 , are able to express strongly - held opinions before coming together again in a spirit of mutual respect and support , to work constructively for the future of @entity21 and indeed all parts of this country			1
‘ my family and i will do all we can to help and support you in this important task			0
’ referring to the vote , a senior aide told the mail last night : ‘ she is head of state and this was a significant constitutional moment for the nation			0
it is right that the @entity0 should reflect and respond to that			2
in 1959 the @entity0 , right , entertained @entity108 president @entity107 , left , at her private retreat in @entity4 ‘ while the campaign was going on it was also right that the @entity0 should stay constitutionally impartial and she maintained throughout that period it was a matter for the people of @entity21			1
’ last night , the @entity0 was due to mark the success of the @entity114 campaign at the @entity115 at @entity4			1
until last week , @entity116 had stayed out of the referendum debate			0
but last sunday the @entity0 uttered her first public words on the subject during a walkabout after church			0
they were seized on by many in the no camp as an endorsement of the @entity22			0
speaking to wellwishers , she said : ‘ i hope everybody thinks very carefully about the referendum this week			0
’ constitutional experts said she chose her words carefully to maintain her neutrality on politics			0
@entity11 , pictured , today announced his resignation claiming his time as leader ' is nearly over ' the queen is believed to have been kept fully updated as the independence vote was counted last night @entity0 , pictured here with @entity11 , right , was said to be privately concerned about the prospect of @entity21 independence and the breakup of the @entity59 which she pledged to govern after many months of discussion , debate , and careful thought , we now know the outcome of the @entity58 , and it is a result that all of us throughout the @entity59 will respect			1
for many in @entity21 and elsewhere today , there will be strong feelings and contrasting emotions – among family , friends and neighbours			1
that , of course , is the nature of the robust democratic tradition we enjoy in this country			0
but i have no doubt that these emotions will be tempered by an understanding of the feelings of others			0
