by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 15 november 2013 @entity2 : 16:27 est , 16 november 2013 the survivors of @entity4 are in desperate need of food and water and a huge relief effort is under way – but a shocking claim has emerged from an aid worker in the @entity12 that government officials are prioritising aid based on who they think will vote for them			1
the worker told @entity18 that the system there is so corrupt that he feared he would ‘ vanish ’ if he was identified			1
he said : ‘ relief is not being distributed fairly in the @entity12			1
the government is prioritising the areas that vote for them			2
this is happening with all the large aid			2
the government is holding funds back and distributing on vote			2
’ however , a spokesman for the @entity31 said : ‘ the @entity31 has had no reports from our member agencies that aid is being prioritised by the @entity12 government on the basis of potential political support			1
‘ the @entity31 charities will fight tooth and nail to make sure aid goes to survivors according to their need alone , without regard for irrelevant factors such as people ’s political views , religion or race			2
’ shocking : an aid worker has claimed that the @entity12 government is distributing aid based on voting patterns			1

the worker explained that this issue with distribution was n’t just happening on a national level – but at a village level , too			1
he said : ‘ it is being reported to us by the locals in one village that the head of the @entity82 [ villages ] gave additional vouchers for relief packs to families they favoured			1
so by the end of the relief , even though we had given exactly the right number of packs for the number of families in the village , several went without			1
‘ they were all telling us that it was done by favouritism			2
’ the worker was distressed that ‘ only @entity57 and @entity65 are getting the international coverage ’ and that the plight of those in other , more remote , areas of the @entity12 was being made worse because ‘ no one even knows about them ’			1

but many people complain that the amount of food being given out is too small			0
@entity175 , 33 , an @entity176 citizen of @entity12 descent who was in @entity178 on eastern @entity180 province when the typhoon struck , told the @entity183 news agency : ' the government 's distribution system is not enough			1
' they are handing out small food packets to each household			0
but when you have three families inside one home , one little packet is not enough			0
' her friend , @entity193 , whose grocery store and warehouse were completely looted after the typhoon , is despondent but determined to carry on with her life and help others			0
a landrover is loaded into the hold of a @entity202 at @entity203 preparing to carry @entity205 aid for victims of the @entity12 typhoon			1

there has been no cell phone service in the town since last friday			0
' this was my store			0
now 's it 's a relief center and a call center , ' said @entity238 , 43			2
' it was ransacked by panicked ... people desperate for food			0
there was no way to control them			0
we had stocked up on food for the @entity248 holidays			0
they took everything , and not just the food			0
they ransacked my office too , anything they could find			0

' now , the barren blue shelves are empty			0

defense secretary @entity264 told @entity183 that armed forces have set up communications lines and c - 130 transport planes are conducting regular flights to @entity65 , the capital of @entity57			2
while the navies of the @entity176 and its allies rushed to the aid of the typhoon - hit @entity12 , a state - of - the - art @entity270 hospital ship has stayed at home and in doing so has become a symbol of @entity270 's tepid response to the crisis			1
generous : @entity176 and its allies have rushed to the aid of the @entity12			1
here @entity176 military personnel load relief aid on to a @entity283 helicopter from the @entity286 @entity285 carrier at a landing zone in @entity65 exhaustion : @entity176 military personnel sleep on aid shipments at @entity290 misery : people wait for flights out of @entity290 in the early hours of friday morning beauty amongst the despair : a rainbow forms over the airport in @entity65 escape : survivors wait for a military plane that will carry them to @entity300 at @entity65 airport a soldier assists young survivors to the military plane at @entity65 airport the decision not to deploy the 14,000 - tonne @entity306 , one of the newest and biggest hospital ships in the world , is one that contrasts with a recent charm offensive across @entity312 by @entity270 as it seeks to bolster ties and ease tension over the disputed @entity316			2
even @entity270 's usually hawkish @entity317 , a tabloid owned by the @entity291 's @entity319 state mouthpiece , on friday called for the @entity320 to sail to the @entity12 , where an international naval flotilla , headed by a @entity176 aircraft carrier strike group , is delivering food , water and medicine			2
initially , @entity270 pledged $ 100,000 in aid to the @entity12 after @entity4 roared across central islands a week ago , and a further $ 100,000 through the @entity329 - figures dwarfed by multi-million dollar donations from countries and corporations around the world			1
even @entity336 furniture chain @entity335 and beverage giant @entity334 have done more than the world 's second - largest economy for the @entity12 .			2
