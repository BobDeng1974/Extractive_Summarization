the time - waster call to @entity11 , which lasted more than a minute , has been singled out as one of numerous mundane calls officers receive			1
despite the woman 's persistence , a patient operator politely directed her to her local council , but not before the obviously upset caller had given her explanation as to why she needed the help of the emergency service			0
scroll down for audio which emergency service do you require ? police today highlighted time - wasting calls to 999 ( stock image ) the woman , who has not been named , dialled 999 and was recorded saying : ' hello , well , i 'm having problems in my house because there are some germs in my bin			1
' when the operator asked her to clarify what exactly was in her bin , she replied : ' maggots			2
' ' maggots in your bin ? ' said the operator			2
the caller answered : ' yes and , well , it 's becoming very serious and i 'm scared if our neighbours are going to complain about it			0
i already tried to sort it out but no - one is able to help me			0
' when the operator explained to her she needed to call the council , the woman , explained : ' yes , but i 'm scared the neighbours are going to turn against me because it 's ( sic ) going to be affected			1
' when the woman said she had already called the council only to be told they could not help her until monday , the operator replied : ' they 're the only people who can help you i 'm afraid because the police do n't sort maggots out			1
' audio has also been released by @entity11 in a bid to tackle the issue of people dial the emergency 999 number inappropriately			1
they say up to one - third of the 999 calls they receive should not have been made			1
in another call , a man dialled 999 asking to be put through to the ambulance service because he needed some pregnancy pills			2
' hello , it 's the police , can i help you , sir ? ' ' no , i do n't need the police , sorry miss. ' ' you phoned 999			1
' ' yes , i asked to be got through to the ambulance , and he did n't hear me properly			0

' ' you want some pregnancy pills ? ' ' yes , i just wanted some pregnancy pills , in'nit			0
' ' yes , well you ca n't phone the ambulance for that i 'm afraid , sir , you need to go into your local pharmacy or doctors ' surgery			0
' meanwhile , @entity91 says a third of its calls are unnecessary and has urged people to think before picking up the phone			1
superintendent @entity96 , @entity91 's officer in charge of communications , said : ' these might sound amusing but there is a serious point to this			0
' while we are distracted with answering these calls we are not attending to other more important calls from the public which potentially could put lives at risk and reduce the service we provide and our response to incidents			0
' other examples include a frustrated television viewer who called because she could not find the movie she wanted to watch			1
' ridiculous ' : in one time - wasting phone call , a woman dialled 999 because she could n't find the film see wanted to watch on @entity118 ( stock image ) the @entity118 subscriber dialled the emergency services number to lodge a complaint when she could not find a particular film on the channel 's movie box service			1
another woman dialled 999 because her daughter 's hamster got stuck under the floorboards			0
and another mother called because her son â€™s radio - controlled helicopter had crashed on a nearby shop roof and they needed help to retrieve it			2
police say these calls waste operators ' time and prevent them from dealing with real emergencies			2
superintendent @entity96 added : ' if it is clearly not a police matter do not use us a directory inquiry or advice service			0
we will and regularly do prosecute callers who repeatedly abuse the 999 system			0
' the simple message is you should only call 999 in an emergency when a crime is in progress , a suspect is nearby or life is in danger			0
for all other matters use the non-emergency number 101			0
