@entity0 insists the likes of captain @entity2 will only leave @entity3 if he is satisfied it 's right for the club			1
as @entity7 revealed this week , @entity6 have placed former @entity8 on a list of potential summer recruits			1
speaking ahead of sunday 's @entity12 clash with the @entity14 club , @entity0 admitted external interest in his promoted players is inevitable			1
@entity3 manager @entity0 will not sell his players unless it is the right move for the club echoing the view of owner @entity23 , however , the @entity21 coach says departures will only happen on his say - so if the price is right			1
' if you do really well in the championship and the players excel then there is going to be interest , ' admitted @entity0			1
' there has been interest in a lot of my players and we have a few boys out of contract , who we are negotiating with at the moment			1
' i would like to try to keep my best players but there is a realisation that bigger clubs can come in and take them			1
' what i would say is : i would n't expect to lose anyone that i do n't want to lose			0
if there are people i want to keep , i expect to keep them			0
hearts have already secured promotion to the @entity53 under @entity0 's stewardship ' if teams come in with an offer that is acceptable to us , then i 'll expect to lose them			1
' what i do n't expect to happen is someone moves on and we are not happy about it			0
if someone leaves the club then it will be on terms that are acceptable to the club and the player			1
' @entity70 coach @entity69 admitted @entity2 , a one - time Â£ 2million signing for @entity71 , is on his list of potential replacements for @entity74 and @entity75 , linked with @entity76 and @entity77			0
with a shrug of resignation , @entity0 added : ' people talk about how comments from other managers can unsettle you			1
i think it gives you a boost , because you realise that teams admire you and are interested in you			0
' when no team is interested in you ... that is what unsettles you			0
you start worrying when nobody is talking about you			0
if there is interest in players then it just shows that they are doing really well			2
' @entity97 clubs talk , but i would like to think the majority of players have enjoyed their season here and would like to have a good crack at the top league			1
this is a great place to play and , if they do leave , then they must be really careful about where they go			2
' owner @entity23 has set @entity0 and his players the target of a top - six finish in the top flight next season @entity0 , alongside director of football @entity114 , is more focused on bringing new players into @entity3 than losing the ones he has			1
defender @entity118 is out of contract , with talks to keep him ongoing			0
' it is a case of getting things ironed out , really , ' continued @entity0			1
' there are also players i want to bring in who i am in talks with			2
the squad needs to change			0
' i ca n't keep the same squad and expect to have the same impact at a higher level			0
players will come in , players will go out and things will continue to evolve			2
hopefully at the end of it we have a better team than we do now			0
' with six games of the @entity12 season to go and promotion already secured , @entity0 already knows his targets for his second season as a manager			1
speaking at the announcement of a ground - breaking sponsorship deal with charity @entity148 , @entity145 set her sights on a top - six finish in the @entity53			2
captain @entity2 has been linked with @entity6 , but wo n't be sold unless it is the right move for @entity3 accepting the challenge , @entity0 said : ' that is a target and life is all about setting yourself targets			1
i think getting into the top six is a reasonable aim			2
' we have good players here already and we will be recruiting again over the summer to get better players in again			2
' we have bags of confidence and a massive fanbase , which has backed us to the hilt			0
we have to aim for the top six			2
' that is just the nature of the beast as head coach of a big football club - you need to meet the standards			2
to be honest , a top - six finish for a club like @entity3 - if they had not been in the @entity12 - would be the bare minimum which should be acceptable			1
' to that end , there has been no let - up since securing promotion			2
@entity3 players were shocked to be saddled with a triple training session this week despite securing their promotion goal with something to spare			1
the former @entity8 defender ( right , pictured against his former club ) could join @entity6 in the summer unbeaten away from home this season , @entity0 wants that record to continue at @entity14 , where his side laid down a marker on the first day of the season			1
' we had a triple session and , although we were n't out for too long , we were working hard for sunday , ' he revealed			2
' we ca n't just think that we can down tools because we have won the league			0
' we have six games and you simply have to win games at @entity3			0
' we are not going to take our foot off the gas			0
it would be easy to just play games in training and say : " let 's have a jolly up for the week "			0
' when you do that , you lose focus and lose sight of what a big game sunday is			0
it is a chance to go to @entity14 as champions and hopefully get a result			0
' ironically , a third victory of the season over a @entity8 side showing signs of improvement under @entity222 would benefit arch city rivals @entity223 the most			1
of the view @entity3 must win games for themselves rather than others , however , @entity0 insisted : ' we do n't owe that to any other teams - we owe it to ourselves and the fans , for our own personal pride			1
we have sold out our allocation on sunday and everyone is paying good money to come and watch us			0
we need to give everything			0
it is not fair if we do n't perform			0

hearts have already secured promotion to the @entity242 top flight
@entity0 believes it is inevitable clubs will come in for his players
he insists he will only sell them if it is the right move for the club
