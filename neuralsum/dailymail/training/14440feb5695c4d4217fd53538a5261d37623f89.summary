the @entity16 lord , 57 , said it was ' ludicrous ' that officers connected to the case had been @entity20 spoke out after the family was informed an internal investigation had ruled no officer was responsible for the death in may of former @entity26 pupil @entity25 , 28			1
@entity0 , left , has vowed to fight for justice for his son @entity13 , right , who died in police custody in @entity8 in may this year the peer 's son died in hospital in the port city of @entity33 on may 19 after he allegedly suffered serious head injuries following his arrest outside a @entity36 today called for a full murder investigation to be launched into the tragedy after a @entity8 cid probe cleared all police officers connected to the @entity41 a statement he said : ' the @entity45 report into @entity13 's death is plainly ludicrous			1
' if the son of a @entity8 official had died in such circumstances , we would not be where we are now			2
' in the face of global scepticism about the credibility of the @entity8 police authorities , we stood back to allow mr @entity56 , director of criminal investigations , to conduct a full and thorough investigation into @entity13 's death			1
' yet his report states he has absolutely no idea how @entity13 died			2
' @entity0 said the @entity8 police report confirmed the opinion of two pathologists that his son was killed by a blow to the head			1
@entity25 had lived with relatives in @entity8 for two years after graduating			2
he was arrested on suspicion of drugs offences on may 19 outside a nightclub in the coastal resort of @entity71 and taken to a local police station , where the family claim he was subjected to a violent attack			2
mr @entity0 was taken to hospital hours later and died while handcuffed to a bed			1

@entity25 was taken to @entity88 following his arrest on may 19 , he later died at the local @entity90 he said : ' mr @entity56 's report concedes and reconfirms the pathologist 's conclusion that @entity13 was killed by blunt force trauma to the head and that the government analyst found no drugs in his body			2
' but it provides no information whatsoever on who was responsible for the fatal injury			0
' in fact , any detail at all is conspicuous by its absence , despite mr @entity56 's claim to have interviewed and recorded statements from 26 witnesses			0
' mr @entity56 even fails to mention that the pathology report stated @entity13 had defensive wounds on his left forearm and severe swelling of the groin , injuries consistent with known police torture methods in @entity8			0
' @entity0 said his family would fight to ensure his son 's death was investigated as @entity121 hereditary peer , who works as a journalist , flew to @entity8 following the @entity125 his latest statement he vowed the family would continue their fight despite the police @entity130 said : ' we have said from the very beginning that @entity13 was brutally killed in police custody which is made perfectly clear by the two autopsy reports			1
' mr @entity56 's report only serves to reinforce our view			0
and yet not a single arrest has been made			0
' we strongly disagree with mr @entity56 's final statement that in his opinion " the circumstances surrounding the death of the deceased ( @entity13 ) can best be determined by a public inquest "			0
' what must be conducted instead is a murder inquiry which must be opened immediately and the suspects who were responsible for @entity13 at the time of his incarceration must be arrested , charged and tried in a court of law			1
' he added : ' this is a setback for us but it is not the end of the road			0
' we are confident that there are people of integrity and influence in @entity8 who will help us get justice for @entity13			0
' if the @entity8 police authorities do not have the stomach to investigate themselves , the case should be handed to another body which does not have existing relationships with the culprits			0
' a body that is both independent and fearless in its pursuit of the law			0
