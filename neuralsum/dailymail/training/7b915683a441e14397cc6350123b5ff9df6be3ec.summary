by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:53 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 04:28 est , 1 august 2013 controversy : @entity3 faced backlash for putting @entity5 on its cover - but sales are up @entity3 's controversial ' @entity9 ' cover doubled the magazine 's monthly sales despite the fact it sparked an intense backlash that saw it pulled from mammoth retailers like @entity15 and @entity16			1
according to newly released figures , news stand sales of the august issue , which had @entity5 's face splashed dreamily across the cover , jumped 102 per cent over average per - issue sales for the past year			1
nearly 1500 retailers sold some 13,232 copies of the ' @entity9 ' issue from july 19 to july 29 , despite a ' @entity27 ' campaign on @entity28 and politicians weighing in to slam the magazine 's editor			1
critics accused @entity3 of being insensitive and glorifying a notorious criminal in a way usually reserved for rock stars			0
the 19 - year - old appeared in the photo with boyish good - looks and tussled curls			1
the photo was a self - portrait by @entity5 and had previously appeared on the cover of the may 5 edition of the @entity43 , with distinctly less furor			2
according to @entity46 , the boycott campaign was never going to have a huge impact on the magazine 's overall bottom line as only 5 per cent of @entity3 's total circulation comes from retail sales			1
but the out - performance , does signify how controversy , and the attention it garners , usually only helps rather than hinders magazine issues flying off the stands			2
when it was released at the start of the month , @entity58 officials and victims lambasted the magazine for celebrating the suspect and ignoring the victims , and retailers , including @entity15 and @entity66 , pulled the edition from its shelves			1
boycott : even tough @entity15 and @entity66 refused to sell the edition , sales for this month are up but a circulation source told the @entity73 on july 24 , that sales for the issue were already running 20 per cent above the normal rate by the first weekend			1
@entity3 usually sells around 81,000 copies , but the estimated sell - through at that stage was already believed to be at least 90,000 copies , the source said			2
a @entity3 spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures			2
the cover identifies the terrorist suspect simply as ' the bomber '			0
the article promises to explain ' how a popular , promising student was failed by his family , fell into radical @entity90 , and became a monster '			0
the cover of @entity3 is typically occupied by rock stars and actors , and many felt the choice glorified @entity5 , who is accused of killing four people and wounding more than 260			0
@entity58 mayor @entity98 described the cover as a ' total disgrace ' and said it should have put survivors or first responders on the cover			0
outcry : @entity58 mayor @entity98 , left , and @entity107 ' @entity106 , right , who was shot in a gunfight with the suspected bombers , criticized the magazine for using @entity5 's picture and ignoring the victims no apology : @entity3 publisher @entity114 , pictured last week , refused to apologize and said the cover of the august edition was consistent with their history of serious journalism ' why are we glorifying a guy who created mayhem in the city of @entity58 ? ' @entity98 asked ' why would we want to heroize this guy ? he 's a terrorist			2
we do n't want him in our neighborhoods			0
we do n't want him on magazines			0
we do n't want him anywhere			0
' @entity128 transit officer @entity127 , who almost died when he was shot during a firefight with the @entity5 brothers , said : ' i can not and do not condone the cover of the magazine			0
' despite the overwhelmingly negative reactions , the editors of @entity3 refused to apologize for their controversial choice , claiming it was in keeping with their long tradition of serious journalism			0
in their brief statement , @entity3 - founded in the 1960s by @entity114 who is still editor - in - chief - said their ' hearts go out to the victims of the @entity9 , and our thoughts are always with them '			1
' the cover story we are publishing this week falls within the traditions of journalism and @entity3 's long - standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day , ' it said			2
weak : in response to the cover , police photographer sgt @entity155 released images , including this one , he took of the moment a bloodied @entity5 was apprehended in @entity159 on april 19 defiant : @entity160 , right , arrives at @entity161 with his son on tuesday , where he learned he has been put on desk duty until an investigation into his conduct is complete pointing out that @entity167 is in the same age group as many of their readers , @entity3 said that fact ' makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue '			1
the use of @entity5 as cover star caused an immediate backlash on social media and @entity15 and @entity66 announced that they would be boycotting the edition from their stores nationwide			1
between them , @entity15 and @entity66 have more than 15,000 locations across the @entity183 in response to the cover , police photographer sgt. @entity155 released photographs showing a weak and bloodied @entity5 in the moments before he was captured			1
the @entity189 police did not authorize the release of the images , and he has now been put on desk duty until an investigation into his conduct is complete			0
@entity5 , who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in @entity189 , has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including the four killings - associated with the bombing .			0
