published : 04:35 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 08:20 est , 19 october 2012 @entity1 's @entity0 has ' tasted ' @entity3 dirt for the first time , testing equipment needed to assess if the planet most like @entity7 in the solar system has the ingredients for microbial life			1
engineers used a robotic scoop to take a small amount of @entity3 soil and place into into an instrument inside the rover - although admitted that a find of brightly coloured ' shards ' in the soil ; caused them to stop for a while			1
initially , the team believed the bright flecks were shed by the rover , similar to bits of plastic debris discovered last week			2
scroll down to see the rover 's first scoopful of mars curiosity on the red planet with the scoops of ground it has taken clearly visible			2
the soil was placed in the analysis instruments at the bottom of the picture			2
the rover 's @entity41 ( @entity40 ) instrument is analyzing this sample to determine what minerals it contains			1
it will identify minerals using x-ray diffraction - the first time the techniques has been used			2
@entity40 will direct a beam of x-rays as fine as a human hair through the powdered material			0
when the x-ray beam interacts with the rock or soil sample , some of the x-rays will be absorbed by atoms in the sample and re-emitted or fluoresced at energies that are characteristic of the particular atoms present , allowing @entity1 to identify minerals in the sample			1
' the science team started to classify these sort of differently , calling them ' schmutz , '' curiosity lead scientist @entity67 , with the @entity68 , told reporters in a conference call			0
' we had a lot of fun with that , labeling them and comparing , but in the end it turns out we really feel this is a different sort of particle , ' he said			0
while not completely ruling out the chance that the flecks are rover debris , most of the team now believes they are naturally occurring , perhaps a mineral that was fractured by the rover scoop			1
to be on the safe side , scientists commanded @entity0 to dump that sample and collect sand from another site for processing in the onboard laboratory			0
the aim is to get an ingredient list of minerals in the @entity3 soil			1
the rover 's @entity41 ( @entity40 ) instrument is analyzing this sample to determine what minerals it contains			1
the rover 's robotic arm delivered the sample to @entity40 's opened inlet funnel on the rover 's deck			2
' we are crossing a significant threshold for this mission by using @entity40 on its first sample , ' said @entity0 's project scientist , @entity67 of the @entity68 in @entity113			0
' this instrument gives us a more definitive mineral - identifying method than ever before used on @entity3 : x-ray diffraction			1
' confidently identifying minerals is important because minerals record the environmental conditions under which they form			0
' the robotic arm on @entity1 's @entity0 delivered a sample of @entity3 soil to the rover 's observation tray for the first time			1
the @entity0 took the sample after arriving at @entity126 , an area where three different types of terrain meet , said @entity67			0
the information scientists glean about the rocks here will help them decide where to finally break out @entity0 â€™s drill , he explained			0
' we consider ourselves now to be in sort of the promised land , ' @entity67 added			1
' we got to believing there were things around us and began to look at everything through that lens , ' said mission manager @entity143 , with @entity1 's @entity144 in @entity113 , @entity145			0
' we definitely are more aware of what 's out there now and are more careful about everything we look at , ' @entity143 said			0
the previous day , the rover shook the scooped material inside sample - processing chambers to scrub internal surfaces of any residue carried from @entity7			0
one earlier scoopful was also used for cleaning			0
additional repetitions of this cleaning method will be used before delivery of a future sample to the rover 's other internal analytic instrument , the @entity162 at @entity3 investigation , which studies samples ' chemistry			1
in august , @entity0 landed inside a 96 - mile - wide ( 154 - km - wide ) impact crater near the @entity3 equator on a $ 2.5 billion , two - year mission to determine if @entity3 had the chemistry to support and preserve microbial life			2
the mission is @entity1 's first astrobiology initiative since the 1970s - era @entity173 probes			0
the researchers hope to find out what the unusual shiny objects spotted on the martian surface are			1

scoop of soil will be analysed to find out what minerals are present in the @entity3 *landscape*
engineers *focusing* on unusual shiny particles spotted in soil
rover has arrived in @entity190 , described as ' promised land ' for its *varied* terrain
