by @entity1 reporter almost 60 families have been left without school places for their children after a council scrapped a new primary school just six weeks before it was due to open			1
furious families blasted ‘ shambolic ’ @entity8 after offering them places at the brand new @entity10 in @entity12 , south - east @entity13 , in april - only for councillors to block the school from opening last week			1
the school , which was hoped to meet the strong demand for primary places in the area , was due to be built on the site of an existing senior school in an exclusive residential street where the average house price is nearly £ 2million			1
class dismissed : some of the parents and pupils now without a school stand alongside @entity29 ( centre ) who was due to be head teacher of the new school two temporary classrooms were to be placed on the site for september , allowing reception classes for children aged four and five , who would enter a newly - built permanent school constructed on the site the following year			1
but local residents had complained the school ’s temporary single - storey classrooms , which would be situated behind high hedges and at least 65ft ( 20m ) from the nearest house , would create ‘ light pollution ’			0
one parent , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ the situation is shambolic			0
@entity48 , one of the councillors who denied planning permission , has already admitted to parents in an email that he did n’t know the council had offered us places there			2
and this man is vice-chairman of the committee			0
‘ and despite admitting he does n’t know what he ’s talking about , he ’s still deemed able to make a decision that has ruined these kids ’ start in life			0
’ furious : mothers @entity64 ( left ) and @entity65 ( right ) are among those whose children are now without a school place mother @entity64 added : ‘ it was @entity8 that offered us the places , there was no caveat that the school would not go ahead on the admissions form - which there were for some schools			1
' how can the council give with one hand and take away with another ? at the very least it makes @entity8 look - for want of a much stronger word – disjointed ' @entity83 , mother ‘ how can the council give with one hand and take away with another ? at the very least it makes @entity8 look - for want of a much stronger word - disjointed			2
’ another parent said : ‘ i would like to know why councillors feel the interests of a few wealthy residents are more important than the education of the children of 60 families who they also have a responsibility towards			0
’ the families , many of whom had already spent almost £ 100 on new @entity100 uniforms , including official school bags and coats , have been told they will not find out where their children will be placed until september – days before the new term begins			1
closed : the entrance to the @entity106 which is currently in use as a senior school councillor @entity109 , chairman of the @entity110 said : ‘ as permission was being sought for 120 pupils and over 80 additional parking spaces , the @entity113 noted that the application would have represented a cramped and substantial intensification of use of the site			2
' @entity113 rejected the application because of this and the increased traffic generation and parking pressure			0
’ a @entity8 spokeswoman said they would be looking to relocate all of the children , but admitted there were no spaces left in any @entity12 schools			2
the councillors who voted against the school – @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity48 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 – all declined to respond to a @entity138 request for comment .			0

@entity106 set to be built along exclusive residential street in @entity13
@entity8 awarded places to families then blocked school from being built
parents may not learn where children will go to school until september
