they are known as the ships of the desert which makes it all the more surprising that the remains of a giant camel have been discovered in the high arctic			1
bone fragments of the shaggy creature were found on @entity9 ’s @entity8 - the furthest north the species has ever been discovered			1
they reveal that the creature must have roamed the frozen northern forests around 3.5 million years ago and that it was 30 per cent larger than its modern counterparts			1
although the region where the fragments were found would have been between 14c to 22c warmer than today , the land would have still been covered with snow for up to nine months of the year			2
artist 's impression of the camels that lived in the @entity22 - which was at least 14c warmer than it is now bone fragments of the shaggy creature ( pictured ) were found on @entity9 's @entity8 scientists claim the discovery may change the way we think of the camels , suggesting they were originally ‘ adapted to living in an @entity22 forest environment ’ instead of their present day habitats			1
traits found in modern camels , such as their humps which serve as a fat store , would have benefited their ancestors during the deep winters when food was scarce			0
other camel characteristics that would have been useful in the frozen conditions include the species ’ wide flat feet , which support the animal on loose sand in the same way that a snowshoe helps a person walk on snow			0
their large eyes would also have helped the prehistoric camels forage during months of @entity22 darkness			0
in total , 30 bone fragments from a tibia , or lower - leg bone , were recovered 750 miles further north than the species has previously ever been found			1
‘ this is an important discovery because it provides the first evidence of camels living in the high arctic region , ’ said dr @entity59 , a palaeontologist with the @entity60 , who led the field expeditions in @entity9 ’s @entity22			0
scientists found the bone fragments 750 miles further north than the species has ever been found before scientists claim the discovery may change the way we think of the camels , suggesting they were originally ' adapted to living in an @entity22 forest environment ' ‘ it extends the previous range of camels in @entity77 northward by about 1,200 km and suggests that the lineage that gave rise to modern camels may have been originally adapted to living in an @entity22 forest environment			1
’ camels originated in @entity77 about 45 million years ago , and dispersed to @entity83 by seven million years ago using the @entity85 land bridge that joined modern - day @entity86 to @entity87			1
‘ we now have a new fossil record to better understand camel evolution ... and the simplest explanation for this pattern would be that @entity94 [ ancient camel species ] originated there , ’ said dr @entity59			0
‘ so perhaps some specialisations seen in modern camels , such as their wide flat feet , large eyes and humps for fat may be adaptations derived from living in a polar environment			0
’ dr @entity105 , from the @entity106 , helped to extract collagen from the bone fragments and to compare them to 37 modern species physical characteristics suggested the fossil fragments belonged to the group of cloven - hoofed animals known as arteriodactyls , which includes cows , pigs and camels			1
scientists from the @entity120 extracted collagen - protein found in mammals - from the bone fragment and compared it to 37 modern species			2
results of tests , published in the journal @entity127 , found an almost identical match between the now extinct animal and a modern - day dromedary , or one - humped camel			0
it also had similarities with the @entity135 giant camel			2
dr @entity105 from the @entity106 , said dna degrades much faster than collagen , and so can not be used to identify prehistoric remains			0
‘ this is the first time that collagen has been extracted and used to identify a species from such ancient bone fragments , ’ he said			2
‘ the fact the protein was able to survive for three and a half million years is due to the frozen nature of the @entity22			2
this has been an exciting project to work on and unlocks the huge potential collagen fingerprinting has to better identify extinct species from our preciously finite supply of fossil material			0

bone fragments from a giant camel were found on @entity8
this is 750 miles further north than the species has been found before
it proves that 3.5 million years ago camels roamed the north 's forests
