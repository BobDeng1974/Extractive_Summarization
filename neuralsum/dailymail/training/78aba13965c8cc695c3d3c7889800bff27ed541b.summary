a university professor died of lung cancer aged 37 after doctors repeatedly dismissed her illness as ' purely psychological '			1
@entity4 , 37 , saw three different doctors with a range of symptoms over a year - long period but they were dismissed as anxiety and depression			1
by the time cancer was finally diagnosed it had spread throughout her body and was terminal			1
dr @entity4 , who was married to a medical doctor and lived in @entity15 and @entity16 , kept a heartbreaking online blog about her treatment			2
misdiagnosis : despite @entity4 seeing three doctors with symptoms , her lung cancer was repeatedly written off as ' anxiety and depression ' shortly after her diagnosis , she wrote : ' how is it possible that a 36 - year - old , health [ obsessed ] conscious , occasionally social smoking , middle class , fiance of a doctor can develop metastatic lung cancer unnoticed			1
how ? ! ? ' what the consultant told us was that not only was it the c - word , but that it was everywhere			0
' my brain , my bones , my liver			0
while in some ways this was a terrible surprise , in another it was a huge relief			0
' for the last year i 'd been battling a range of bizarre and seemingly disparate symptoms that had forced me in september 2011 to go on sick leave from my job as a lecturer ( assistant professor )			1
' the diagnosis at the time was anxiety and / or depression			0
and while i was both anxious and depressed , this was due to the increasingly disabling symptoms that my doctor kept insisting were purely psychological			2
' so i was actually grateful for a medical diagnosis that confirmed there were objective , physical reasons behind my illness			0
' @entity61 - educated dr @entity4 , who was originally from @entity62 , wrote how she first experienced shortness of breath and wheezing in late 2010 , which was wrongly diagnosed as asthma			1
not psychological : @entity4 said in her blog she was relieved to have a concrete diagnosis even though it was of cancer in spring 2011 , she was referred to a physiotherapist for shoulder and arm pain and started experiencing ' visual migraines ' - losing her vision for half an hour - in june			1
by september 2011 , dr @entity4 was so sick she was forced to leave work , having been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and put on anti-depressants			1
but despite a dramatic weight loss , she claimed three different family doctors refused to consider her symptoms in connection with each other			1
relief : dr @entity4 wrote a blog on her diagnosis , saying she was ' actually grateful ' for a medical diagnosis that confirmed there were ' objective , physical reasons ' behind her symptoms she wrote : ' still , despite my pleas , and a dramatic weight loss , none of my doctors ( and i saw three different family practitioners ) would consider my symptoms in conjunction with one another - insisting that they were all common , unrelated problems ( migraines , asthma , depression , back pain )			1
' in november 2011 , she misread her asthma prescription and took ten times the recommended amount - but the drug made no difference to a violent cough			0
her doctor finally sent her for a routine x-ray and within hours , she was given the devastating news that she had cancer			0
on her blog , called @entity116 - as stage iv of cancer is considered terminal - she describes her journey from ' a woman diagnosed with " anxiety " to one with metastatic cancer '			2
dr @entity4 wrote : ' i ca n't prove it , and this is just my opinion , but i have no doubt in my own mind that my misdiagnosis was in large part due to the fact that i was a middle aged female and that my male doctors were preconceived towards a psychological rather than a physiological diagnosis			1
' it is so easy to say that someone 's symptoms are " anxiety " related if they are a little bit complicated , unclear or unusual			0
do n't repeat my mistakes			0
' you know when something is wrong			0
find another doctor that you connect with and who takes your concerns seriously			0
' dr @entity4 worked in the global studies department at the @entity148 between 2009 and 2012 , but took early retirement			2
despite battling the disease , she maintained an honorary lectureship in the department until her death on february 21			0
she also completed a @entity154 to raise funds for the @entity156 in november 2012			0
a blog post from november 3 2012 , marking the one year anniversary of @entity4 's lung cancer diagnosis professor @entity160 , head of the school of global studies at the @entity148 , led @entity163 said : ' @entity4 was a fantastic colleague and friend , a great teacher and researcher and truly inspirational in the way she dealt with her illness			1
' professor @entity169 , head of international relations , added : ' @entity4 was an outstanding colleague who shared her intellectual and personal vivacity with academics and students alike			2
' @entity174 and the @entity16 and @entity175 were unable to confirm that they were involved with @entity4 's treatment .			2

@entity4 , 37 , saw three doctors with a range of symptoms over a year
