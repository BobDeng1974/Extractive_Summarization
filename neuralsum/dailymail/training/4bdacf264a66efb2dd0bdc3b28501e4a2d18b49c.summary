@entity2 's daughter @entity8 is trying to unseat an incumbent @entity11 senator in @entity12 and drew ire from her family after after reaffirming her opposition to same - sex marriage on @entity16			1
' i was watching my sister - in - law on @entity19 ( yes @entity8 , in fifteen states and the @entity22 you are my sister - in - law ) , ' @entity5 wrote after the interview			1
' and was very disappointed to hear her say ' i do believe in the traditional definition of marriage			1
' not backing down : @entity8 reasserted her stance against gay marriage in november despite having a legally - married lesbian sister @entity8 's comment came after she addressed accusations that she is a ' flip - flopper ' on the issue since she supports giving the choice to the states rather than an amendment to the @entity38 @entity37			1
that bit of hedging was not enough for @entity5			0
' i ca n't help but wonder how @entity8 would feel if as she moved from state to state , she discovered that her family was protected in one but not the other , ' @entity5 wrote			2
@entity5 said that her sister - in - law ' did n't hesitate ' to congratulate she and @entity5 on their marriage and called @entity8 's comments ' offensive to say the least			1
' @entity2 in - fighting ? @entity5 took to @entity6 to address comments her @entity9 candidate sister - in - law , @entity2 's daughter @entity8 , made opposing same - sex marriage no happy : @entity5 ( right ) and her wife @entity5 have publicly shamed @entity8 for campaign message against gay marriage as she seeks a @entity9 seat in ultra-conservative @entity12 ' i always thought freedom meant freedom for everyone , ' @entity5 wrote			1
it was n't long before @entity5 picked up the story and gave her thoughts on @entity6			2
' could n't have said it better myself , ' @entity5 wrote after sharing her wife 's post			2
' @entity8 - this is n't just an issue on which we disagree - you 're just wrong - and on the wrong side of history			2
' this is n't the first time @entity2 has made her feelings about her sister known publicly			0
in september , @entity2 called her candidate sister 's stance on gay married ' dead wrong ' in a @entity6 post			1
' for the record , i love my sister , but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage			2
@entity83 means freedom for everyone			0
that means that all families - regardless of how they look or how they are made - all families are entitled to the same rights , privileges and protections as every other			0
' @entity8 addressed the longstanding argument with her sister on @entity19 , calling it an issue ' on which we disagree '			1
@entity2 's strong stance on the issue of gay marriage may have to do with her fight to win the senate race in ultra-conservative @entity12			2
‘ i am not pro-gay marriage , ’ @entity2 previously said in a statement released by her campaign			0
@entity2 announced her run for senate against incumbent @entity11 senator @entity11 earlier this year			0
‘ i believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states , ’ the statement continued , ‘ and by the people in the states , not by judges and not even by legislators , but by the people themselves			0
’ ' you 're just wrong ' : @entity5 publicly affirmed her wife 's remarks against @entity8 as part of a rare glimpse at the usually tight , clanish @entity2 family 's disagreements sisters at war : the @entity12 candidate for senate @entity8 , left , announced her staunch opposition to gay marriage angering her gay married sister , @entity5 , right daughter : ms @entity8 , the eldest daughter of former vice president @entity2 , left , had begun telling associates of her decision over the weekend , @entity132 reported late sunday push back ? @entity8 claims her opponent @entity11 is conducting a push poll campaign that asks voters ' are you aware that @entity8 supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage ? ' this stance is also a slight departure for the candidate in regards to her high profile family			1
since as far back as 2004 , @entity2 has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance			0
‘ @entity151 and i have a gay daughter , so it ’s an issue our family is very familiar with , ’ @entity2 told an audience that included his daughter while stumping in @entity150 in 2004			0

people ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to			0
