by @entity0 published : 14:57 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 03:52 est , 25 february 2013 topless protesters targeted @entity3 's former premier @entity2 as he went to vote in the country 's election - which could plunge @entity6 into fresh economic chaos			1
the three women , thought to be from feminist protest group @entity10 , burst from a crowd of journalist outside a polling station in @entity14 and lunged at the controversial politician			1
but the demonstrators , who had ' @entity18 ' , meaning ' enough of @entity2 ' , written on their bodies , were grabbed by police officers and dragged away before they could reach him			1
@entity30 continues tomorrow amid fears the current administration will have to negotiate with either former premier or a stand - up comedian to retain power			0
the results , which will be affected by heavy snow in northern areas , do not look likely to produce a government strong enough to pull the highly indebted country out of its economic slump			0
a hung parliament is a distinct possibility , but new elections within months could , many fear , prompt a new dip in confidence in the @entity50 ’s single currency			1
market investors are already nervous about any successor to @entity54 ’s technocratic government being willing to continue his austerity programme and implement necessary reform			2
activists : the woman are thought to from feminist protest group @entity10 and burst out of a crowd of journalist unsuccessful : the protester were dragged away by police officers and were not able to get the @entity64 at the start of the campaign the polls were predicting a comfortable victory for the centre left led by @entity71 now moderate @entity70 and his @entity73 pd			1
but after a lacklustre campaign by @entity70 , the most recent polls suggest that a brazenly populist campaign ( including a virtual bribe of a huge tax refund for all ) by the three - time pm @entity2 has clawed him back into contention			2
a remarkable come - back from a politician convicted of tax fraud and on trial on a charge of under - age sex with a prostitute			2
as ever the mogul , 76 , has used his major control of the media to blitz tv and newspaper coverage , and today compared @entity3 judges to the ‘ mafia ’			0
meanwhile the prospect of a huge protest vote against the @entity54 ’s government ’s painful austerity measures and a never ending series of corruption scandals has thrown the result wide open			1
election : @entity2 cast his ballot today but the polls will also be open across the country tomorrow powerful : the 76 - year - old has used his major control of the media to blitz tv and newspaper coverage ' i 'm not confident that the government that emerges from the election will be able to solve any of our problems , ' said @entity116 , a 55 - year - old builder in @entity14 , who voted for the anti-establishment @entity118			1
the anarchic group led by a stand up comedian turned political activist @entity122 has been one of the surprise features of the campaign , packing the piazzas of @entity3 ’s cities with hundreds of thousands of supporters			0
challenger : leader of the @entity118 , stand - up comedian @entity122 , has been the surprise feature of the election @entity122 , 64 , ( who also has a criminal conviction , for involuntary manslaughter ) advocates a new direct democracy which has the main parties scared			2
the polls suggest he could come as high as second when the votes are counted			0
' he ’s the only real new element in a political landscape where we ’ve been seeing the same faces for too long , @entity138 said @entity143 , 48 , in the @entity145 capital @entity146			0
meanwhile @entity3 give caretaker @entity147 almost no credit for saving them from the brink of financial ruin 15 months ago			0
if opinion polls are converted into votes , his policies of tough medicine will have been rejected by the electorate			0
when the last polls closed two weeks ago @entity70 was leading at 35 per cent with with @entity2 5 points behind , @entity122 on 16 and @entity54 on around 14			2
a victory for @entity2 could be the worst result for the @entity161 because he has promised to reverse many of the austerity measures brought in by @entity54 to get interests rates down			1
but as seems more likely , with @entity2 ’s resurgence and @entity122 ’s protest vote , the two comic faces of @entity3 politics could prevent a @entity70 - @entity54 government from being formed , the only government likely to command international confidence			1
for the third - largest @entity161 economy to be facing economic meltdown could trigger a renewal of the @entity28 crisis just when the worst seemed to be over			0
a crisis which would affect a @entity177 economy already reeling from the downgrading of its credit rating .			0

the naked demonstrators lunged at the @entity64 outside a polling station
but they were grabbed by police before they could reach the politician
hung parliament could lead to a dip in confidence in the single currency
@entity2 has promised to reverse austerity measures if he wins election
