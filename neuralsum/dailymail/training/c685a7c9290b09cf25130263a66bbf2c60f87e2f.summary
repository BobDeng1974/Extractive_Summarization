but children in @entity11 and @entity12 are the least generous with around £ 6 being spent on their presents for mum			1
show her you care : mothers in @entity7 can expect the most generous presents this sunday according to new research on @entity5 gifting @entity19 's think that children spend 30 per cent less on @entity5 compared to @entity21			1
this is mainly due to mums not wanting material gifts , backed up by the survey which shows that mums claiming that the best gift for mothers day is a thoughtful card ( 29 per cent ) , a favourable bunch of flowers ( 15 per cent ) and a nice lunch out ( 12 per cent )			0
the survey of almost 2,000 mums actually found that all most of them want for mothering sunday is to spend time with their children ( 47 per cent ) , or be pampered by having a lie - in ( 30 per cent ) , being treated to breakfast in bed ( 26 per cent ) or having an uninterrupted soak in the bath ( 18 per cent )			2
size matters : ' you should n't have darling ' coupled with an expression like this really means ' where 's the rest of it ? ' but nearly half ( 49 per cent ) of mums expect their partner to indulge them too			0
a spokesperson for @entity53 , which carried out the survey , said : ' it 's interesting to see what presents mums would like for @entity5 and what people spend , but all mums really want is a bit of time to relax and be spoiled and this need n't cost the earth			0
' breakfast in bed or a lie - in can be just as cherished by busy mums as any bouquet of flowers			0
