the @entity0 is set to replace its ' @entity1 ' less than a decade after it was first introduced at a cost of $ 5billion			0
the design , which combines grey and green blotches in a pixellated pattern , was supposed to disguise soldiers equally well in desert and in more temperate terrain			1
but critics claim that the camouflage did not work properly in either environment - and some have even suggested that its main purpose was to make the @entity0 appear ' more cool ' than the @entity15			1
while soldiers were issued with desert camouflage uniforms , their darker equipment - including flak jackets - stood out against the light - coloured clothing , making troops dangerously conspicuous			1
so researchers at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity40 got to work designing a replacement which could be used by soldiers wherever they are in the world			1
but their delicate work was held back by official meddling , accord to some of the people involved in the process			2
' it got into political hands before the soldiers ever got the uniforms , ' @entity53 , a textile technologist at the centre , told @entity32			1
redundant : the design is being replaced even though it has already cost the @entity0 around $ 5billion the problem was apparently that @entity0 commanders were envious of a cutting - edge new camouflage recently developed by the @entity15 which incorporated pixels rather than the more traditional waves of colour			1
so officials from @entity68 , which is responsible for procuring equipment , ordered developers to adapt their new grey - green colour scheme into the pixel pattern - even though experts argued this compromise would leave soldiers vulnerable in battle			1
' brand identity trumped camouflage utility , ' according to military journalist @entity79			2
' that 's what this really comes down to : we ca n't allow the @entity15 to look more cool than the @entity0			1
' the results , according to some of the soldiers who had to wear the new uniform after it was introduced in 2004 , was a disaster			2
new look : this @entity91 design is a temporary replacement for the failed @entity1 ' essentially , the @entity0 designed a universal uniform that universally failed in every environment , ' an @entity0 specialist who served in @entity30 told @entity32			1
' the only time i have ever seen it work well was in a gravel pit			0
' he continued : ' as a cavalry scout , it is my job to stay hidden			0
wearing a uniform that stands out this badly makes it hard to do our job effectively			0
if we can see our own guys across a distance because of it , then so can our enemy			0
' now researchers are working on developing a replacement to the $ 5billion flop , and for the time being have introduced a temporary fix in the form of a new green and brown camouflage known as @entity91			2
the permanent solution will not be ready for battlefield use until some time next year			0
when it is introduced , the @entity1 saga will formally come to an end , though not without a certain amount of recrimination within the military			0
' you 've got to look back and say what a huge waste of money that was , ' camouflage expert @entity127 said			0
' @entity1 was such a fiasco			0
' video : filmed jan , 2008			0

camouflage made of grey and green pixels was designed to work in desert
but soldiers say uniform ' universally failed in every environment '
design was based on @entity15 uniform and experts say it was result of a ' political ' effort to stay ' cool ' in *comparison*
