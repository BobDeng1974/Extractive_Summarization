@entity0 insists the @entity2 management are more than happy with @entity4 's contribution at the @entity5 so far			1
@entity4 came under fire for a sub-par performance in saturday 's 2 - 1 defeat against @entity9			1
@entity4 set up @entity10 for @entity2 's equaliser , but he missed two good chances in the second half of the defeat in @entity15			2
' my opinion is that @entity4 , after seeing him every day in training , is a very important player , ' said @entity0 , now an @entity2 coach			1
' he is our top goal scorer under ( manager ) @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , he is our main assist man and probably but for a yard he would have been man of the match if he had scored that goal ( against @entity9 )			0
' we came off the pitch the other night and had our coaching debrief with @entity37 , @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 ) and myself and there was no other suggestion that @entity4 had played pretty well for us in that game , that he had done everything we asked for			1
' @entity53 , a former team - mate of @entity4 and @entity0 , sparked controversy when he suggested the @entity2 striker may be past his @entity56 satisfied : @entity0 , @entity38 and the @entity2 coaching staff agreed that @entity4 had played ' pretty well ' assist : @entity4 provided the cross for @entity10 's equalizing goal against @entity9 in @entity15 @entity0 refused to get drawn into a row with the former @entity63 and @entity2 midfielder			1
' @entity53 is a great friend of mine but i am coaching @entity4 , i am of the opinion that when you get to a player like @entity4 , you have to cope with everything that is thrown your way , ' @entity0 added on @entity71			2
' it was n't just @entity53 talking about @entity4			0
the fact of the matter is that it is one man 's opinion , it 's @entity53 's opinion and everyone else will have their opinion			0
' @entity0 concurred with @entity38 's assertion that the nation has an ' obsession ' with @entity4			2
expected : @entity0 says that players of @entity4 's calibre are used to criticism and it happens at every @entity5 pressure : players like @entity90 ( left ) and @entity91 ( right ) are always highlighted in tournaments says @entity0 ' you can call it a debate or an obsession ( about @entity4 ) , ' he added			0
' i do n't think either are wrong because every time i have been part of a tournament i have seen this with a player , whether it be ( @entity53 ) @entity90 , ( @entity104 ) @entity91 , ( @entity105 ) @entity106 or @entity4			0
the whole country loves creating a drama around one player			0
