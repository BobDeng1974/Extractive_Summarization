by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 10:17 est , 16 september 2013 she 's been described as a rottweiler , her partner 's achilles heel and has suffered unfavourable comparisons to her glamorous predecessor @entity6			2
but although the media brickbats hurt , @entity7 , partner of @entity9 president @entity8 , says she has no intention of doing things any way other than her own			1
but formidable though she is , @entity7 , 48 , revealed in an interview with the @entity16 that becoming first lady of @entity9 was a ' frightening ' experience that took her months to overcome			1
' it ’s very frightening at the beginning , ' she told the paper			2
you have absolutely no idea of what awaits you , and at the same time absolutely everyone has their eyes on you			2
i was frightened of being observed , judged			2
' @entity30 : despite the media brickbats , @entity7 says she 's far nicer than people realise controversy : president @entity8 's former partner @entity34 ( left ) said @entity7 has a ' @entity36 ' since then , she 's had to contend with the fallout from a very public spat with president @entity8 's former wife , the socialist politician @entity34 , and the publication of a succession of books , including one that alleged that she had an affair during her relationship with @entity8			1
another , between two fires by investigative journalist @entity49 , described her as ' a cocktail of jealousy , vengeance and political calculation ' while in a third , @entity54 , she was dubbed ' not normal , snooty , infatuated , explosive , unpredictable and visibly dangerous ' by journalist @entity55			0
@entity34 even went on record to say @entity7 suffers from a ' @entity36 ' - a reference to the @entity59 novel in which the protagonist is haunted by thoughts of her husband 's first wife			1
so bad did things become , at one point , @entity7 admits she contemplated never setting foot inside the @entity67 [ the @entity9 no. 10 ] again			1
' there was a moment when i did n’t come at all , ' revealed @entity7 , who lives with @entity8 in a @entity72 apartment			1
on duty : @entity7 attending a @entity75 summit with @entity76 and @entity78 's @entity77 @entity80 amour : @entity7 shares a tender moment with @entity8 after his 2012 election victory predecessor : @entity7 is a more low maintenance @entity85 than @entity6 ' i could almost have never come back			1
then , well , i got over all that and came back bit by bit			0
' a year on from the @entity34 controversy , @entity7 is concentrating on causes close to her heart - in particular those aimed at helping the women of the @entity94 where rape is endemic - and finding ways to help underprivileged @entity9 children			1
later this month , she will travel to @entity99 ahead of an official visit from president @entity8 to promote local good causes and emphasise to the local population that dealings with @entity9 do n't always have to come at the sharp end of a missile			0
she does all this , as she ca n't resist pointing out , with far fewer aides than her predecessor - and all while continuing to hold down a job as a journalist			0
one thing , though , has n't changed			0
she is , she declares , as in love with her diminutive partner , as ever			0
' what attracted me is [ that ] he has an enormous amount of charm and a lot of humour , ' @entity7 revealed			2
' above all , he has this vivacity , he ’s more quick - witted than anyone i ’ve known			0
' and what does she say to those who claim she 's the formidable madame to @entity8 's genial ' monsieur normal ' ? ' he is n’t the nice one people think , ' she says , ' and i ’m not the nasty one people think			0
he ’s much harder than people imagine			0

@entity7 , 48 , admitted that becoming first lady was ' frightening '
was *afraid* of being judged and had no idea of what awaited her
she has endured several crises since moving into the @entity67
