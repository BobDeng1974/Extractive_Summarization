turn - off : @entity0 and @entity1 as aristocratic @entity2 it was billed as the @entity5 ’s big - budget fightback in television ’s sunday night ratings battle			2
@entity8 hoped its lavish new version of @entity10 would serve up the same sort of success enjoyed by @entity15 ’s country house saga @entity13			1
but after two series it seems the @entity5 has admitted defeat – axeing the revived period drama because of falling ratings			2
yesterday it was confirmed that there would not be a third series after more than two million viewers turned off between the first episode and the last			1
the decision comes despite attempts to ‘ sex up ’ the plot with the introduction of lesbian archaeologist dr @entity29 , played by @entity30 and @entity32 star @entity31			0
she was seen in bed with her bisexual lover , played by @entity36			0
but the move failed to pay off , and fans criticised @entity10 for its incredulous and at times far - fetched storylines			1
in one episode , future @entity42 president @entity41 visited sir @entity46 ’s @entity45 townhouse for a dinner party and fell ill after getting drunk			0
other sensational storylines involved beautiful but troubled @entity49 , younger sister of @entity51 , who was played by @entity53 in the space of six episodes she managed to seduce her sister ’s husband , give secrets to the @entity59 and shoot a maid with a pistol			0
she later died when she plunged off a balcony			0
@entity10 was revived in 2010 after 40 years off screen , and when a second six - part series began in january it drew 6.5 million viewers			1
but within a week 700,000 had switched off and by the time the series ended last month , just 4.45 million were watching			1
when the finale of @entity13 ’s second series was broadcast in november , 10.5 million viewers tuned in			1
a @entity5 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ 2012 has been a great year for @entity5 drama but at this stage there are no plans for @entity10 to return			2
’ lavish : despite great expense being spend on costumes and sets , the modern version of @entity10 was not a ratings winner reborn : @entity10 came back onto television screens in 2010 after a 40 absence , but rating soon started to slip the drama , which follows the lives of the ‘ upstairs ’ residents of 165 @entity87 in @entity45 and their ‘ downstairs ’ staff , was the brainchild of veteran actresses and best friends @entity93 and @entity94 – who played housemaid turned housekeeper @entity96 in the original series first screened on @entity15 in 1971			1
axed : lady @entity98 , played by @entity36 , dr @entity29 , played by @entity31 were introduced to ' sex up ' the plot @entity93 and @entity102 teamed up again in 2009 to work on a revival for the @entity5			0
the new version was set a few years after the original as @entity45 prepared for the @entity106 , and starred @entity1 and @entity0 as aristocrats sir @entity46 and @entity108			2
the commission was widely seen as a response to the success of @entity13 , set in a @entity113 stately home and following the lives of the aristocratic @entity116 family			0
stars include @entity118 as @entity119 and @entity120 as @entity121			0
@entity10 has failed despite lavish sets and a big - name cast , including former @entity125 actress @entity124 , @entity127 star @entity126 and veteran @entity128			1
the first series struggled to match the ratings of its @entity15 rival when it aired over christmas 2010			2
however , the @entity5 commissioned a second series that began in january this year			1
@entity10 was hit by further setbacks when co-creator @entity93 quit the series last august , two months before filming began , amid claims she was unhappy with the direction producers had taken her character @entity139			1
the 77 - year - old dame said last night : ‘ i think it ’s sad it ’s not going on but you ca n’t blame the cast , who were wonderful			0
’ there was another blow when @entity102 , 77 , was forced to scale back her involvement after suffering a minor stroke			0
miss @entity94 – the only cast member to appear in both the original series and the revival – eventually appeared in just two scenes during the six episodes .			0
