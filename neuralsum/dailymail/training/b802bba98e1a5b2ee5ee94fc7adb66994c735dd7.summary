by @entity0 a toddler born with a rare defect has made a miraculous recovery after surgeons were forced to break open his skull and piece it back together like a jigsaw			1
at eight - months - old , @entity7 was diagnosed with saggital craniosynostosis ( @entity10 ) , a condition causing the skull plates fuse together before birth			1
he endured a seven - and - a - half - hour operation to correct the problem and reshape his skull , spending days recovering in @entity16			1
but now parents @entity18 , 26 , and @entity19 , 26 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , said they are ' thrilled ' their son , now one , is on the road to recovery			1
@entity7 underwent a ' miraculous ' operation to correct a rare skull condition , which resulted in his head growing in an unusual shape at eight - months - old @entity7 was diagnosed with saggital craniosynostosis , a condition causing the skull plates fuse together before birth			1
the condition causes intracranial pressure , which can lead to persistent headaches , blurred vision and other symptoms ‘ when @entity7 was born in january 2013 , his head circumference was larger than normal , ’ said miss @entity18			1
‘ his head was long and narrow but he had a ridge at the top , which meant that newborn hats were much too small			0
’ however , @entity7 passed all his developmental checks and as far as the doctors and his parents were concerned , he was a happy , healthy baby			1
but , in august 2013 , when he was eight - months - old , he developed gastroenteritis and required treatment at the @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49			0
by chance , a paediatric nurse noticed the unusual shape and size of his head			2
‘ she advised us to get it measured , ’ miss @entity18 said			2
‘ at first , i was offended but we were referred to see a specialist			0
’ initially , the specialist did n’t have any concerns but then he called the family at home to say he suspected a skull defect			1
a scan confirmed that @entity7 had @entity64 , which affects an estimated one in every 1,800 to 3,000 children			2
three out of every four cases affects boys			0
it can lead to a build - up in pressure in the brain causing headaches , blurred vision and breathing problems			1
‘ it was completely out of the blue and , at that point , our world fell apart , ’ said miss @entity18			2
surgeons at @entity83 had to cut @entity7 's scalp from ear to ear before breaking his skull and piecing it back together like a jigsaw puzzle @entity89 is a rare condition , which causes babies to develeop an irregularly shaped skull			1
the abnormal shape of a child 's head can cause persistent headaches , learning difficulties , problems with vision			1
symptoms of craniosynostosis result from increased pressure in the skull , called intracranial pressure			1
the condition causes a baby 's skull to prematurely fuse , leaving it unable to grow in certain areas			1
where one area is fused the skull is prevented from growing			0
it causes other parts of the skull to ' overgrow ' to compensate and limit the pressure devleoping around the brain			2
the lack of growth in some areas , and ' overgrowth ' in others causes the irregular head shape			0
@entity125 synostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis , accounting for around half of all cases			0
it occurs when the suture - the elastic tissues connecting the plates of bone in the skull - at the top of the head fuses			1
it leads to a lack of growth in width and compensatory growth in length , resulting in a long , narrow skull			0
source : @entity146 ‘ the doctor explained that if nothing was done now , @entity7 ’s head would look like a rugby ball when he was older and he could suffer real problems			1
‘ the only option was a gruelling operation			0
i felt sick and angry and kept thinking : ‘ why my child ? ’ @entity7 underwent the seven - and - a - half hour operation at @entity83 , on march 12 , when he was 13 - months old			1
during the painstaking procedure , surgeons cut his scalp from ear to ear , broke his skull into pieces and , in their words , ‘ put it back together like a jigsaw puzzle ’			1
‘ we ’d been warned that there was a small risk he might not make it through the surgery , ’ miss @entity18 said			2
‘ while he was having the operation , @entity170 and i walked around the hospital in a daze , trying to kill time			2
we did a lot of crying as we waited for news			0
‘ thankfully , @entity7 made it through but it was eight hours before we could see him			2
nothing could have prepared us for the sight of our baby lying in @entity16 , with a drain in his head			0
‘ the following day , his head swelled so much , he could n’t open his eyes			0
he did n’t look like our little boy anymore			0
' but , by day three , he was able to sit up and was in good spirits			0
he even unravelled the bandage from around his head			0
‘ we were devastated by the extent of the scarring on his scalp			0
the cut ran like an @entity191 from ear to ear			0
@entity7 's father , @entity19 ( right ) and his mother @entity18 ( left ) are raising money for the hospital			1
miss @entity18 said they are delighted at the results			2
' he 's bounced back amazingly from his ordeal			2
we 're so proud of our brave boy , ' she told @entity203			0
‘ but the operation was a success and we were thrilled by the new shape of @entity7 ’s head			1
rather than being long and narrow , it was lovely and round			0
' after five days in hospital , we were able to take our baby home			0
’ ten weeks after his operation , @entity7 is back to his cheerful self , the swelling has gone down and his blond hair has grown over the scar , which has already started to fade			1
' he 's bounced back amazingly from his ordeal			2
we 're so proud of our brave boy ' - @entity18 , @entity7 's mother @entity89 can cause developmental problems , but @entity7 seems to be developing normally			1
although there is a chance that he may develop more problems in future , regular check - ups will monitor his progress – and the family are hopeful that his health problems are in the past			0
‘ although @entity7 ’s skull feels bumpy under his scalp , where it ’s still knitting back together , his head is now the perfect shape , ’ miss @entity18 added			1
‘ he ’s bounced back amazingly from his ordeal			0
we ’re so proud of our brave boy			0
