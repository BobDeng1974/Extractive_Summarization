ms @entity6 , from @entity35 , @entity36 , said : ‘ it ’s incredible to see how far @entity22 has come			1
‘ signing the form that gave the surgeons permission to amputate was one of the hardest decisions i ever made - but i now know it was the right thing			2
‘ to see @entity22 running around and playing with her older sister , @entity44 , is just amazing			2
’ @entity22 was born with @entity23 , a condition that meant her tibia bones - the second largest bone in the leg - did not form			1
doctors warned that as the she grew , @entity10 would have severe difficulties with walking and mobility , leaving ms @entity6 with two options			1
‘ i had spoken to doctors abroad who said it would be possible to use @entity10 ’s toes to try and grow new tibia bones , and we could also try leg lengthening procedures , ' ms @entity6 said			1
‘ this method was going to be a very long and painful process - and may not actually work			0
‘ the other option was to amputate , and ultimately , i felt this option was the only one i could choose			0
’ after agonising , her mother let doctors amputate her daughter 's legs when she was just a year old ( left ) @entity22 can now move around like any other child with the help of prosthetics , her mother ( right ) said now with the aid of her prosthetic legs , @entity10 , now four , can move around like any other four - year - old after talking to charities such as steps , ms @entity6 came to conclusion that if @entity22 did not have an operation or an amputation , she would never be able to walk			1
@entity22 underwent surgery in november 2011 , when she was one			2
ms @entity6 said : ‘ the time leading up to the surgery was very difficult			1
‘ you are asked to sign a form to confirm that you want them to do the operation , and it was horrible			0
‘ @entity22 was so little , just a baby , it was hard to think about what she was going to be put through			2
‘ i wondered if she would hate me one day for doing this to her , but i just had to remember that it was going to change her life for the better			0
‘ when she came round from the operation , i was so relieved she was okay - it was odd to see her without her legs			2
‘ but when they took the casts off i was pleased , the stitching was tidy and it looked very neat			0
i was actually really pleased			0
’ within a week , @entity22 began to walk on her new stumps			0
‘ obviously i ’d been concerned with how she would adapt , but she was amazing , ’ ms @entity6 said			2
‘ she ’s a feisty little thing and i think she shocked everyone with her progress			0
she was n’t fazed by any of it ; she just got on with it			0
’ @entity22 was fitted with prosthetic limbs the following february and grasped using them straight away			0
she has learned to use her prosthetics so adeptly that she can run and bounce on a trampoline @entity10 has also now learnt to dance , run , cycle and even play on a bouncy castle ( left ) , without any help			2
her bike ( right ) was specially built for her after a fundraising campaign , because she could not use a traditional bike ‘ now that @entity10 is growing up , she knows that she ’s different to other people , but she takes it in her stride , ’ ms @entity6 said			1
‘ sometimes she will ask me if she can grow some legs and toes , but i explain to her gently that it ’s not possible			0
‘ she goes dancing , swimming , she jumps on the trampoline in our garden and she runs around with her big sister			0
‘ she was walking unaided by the time she was two , she ’s very determined			1
’ thanks to the support from her local community , @entity10 now even has a specially made bike that she can cycle around on			2
ms @entity6 explained : ‘ @entity10 and @entity44 were playing in the garden and @entity44 was on a bike ‘ i put @entity10 on hers and she could n’t use it as her prosthetics do n’t allow her legs to bend			1
it was really sad to watch her as she so desperately wanted to be able to use it			0
‘ so i started fundraising for a specially adapted bike that you pedal with your hands			0
‘ when we finally got it she was so excited , and now she even uses it to cycle to school			0
’ ‘ i ’m just so proud of her , she ’s gone through so much , and there ’s no stopping her			0
