@entity68 in the @entity27 , for example , is an mvno because it runs on @entity49 ’s network			0
in the @entity71 , @entity70 shares @entity73 ’s , and ultimately @entity111 ’s , networks			0
an mvno is typically run as an independent company , with its own staff and customer service he described the plans as a ‘ project ’ and will do it on a small enough scale to not threaten existing networks			0
