@entity0 's receiving the dole could soon be subjected to mandatory drug testing in order to continue receiving payments			1
the harsh suggestion is part of a major overhaul of the welfare system by the @entity10 government			0
inspiration for the change has come from @entity14 's welfare system which halves welfare recipients ' payments when they fail a job - required drug test or refuse to submit to one			1
social services minister @entity27 said ' we wo n't rule this in or out			0
' but the hardline approach has shown little result in @entity14 where only 22 of 8001 welfare receiving job seekers tested positive to drug use or had refused to take tests			1
despite this , the government will look towards @entity14 's welfare system which mr @entity27 told the @entity38 , was simpler and less expensive than @entity0 ’s current structure			1
the approach has shown little result in @entity14 where only 22 of 8001 welfare receiving job seekers tested positive to drug use or had refused to take tests ' while @entity0 's welfare system is different from @entity14 , its reforms provide a guide as to the government ’s thinking on simplifying our welfare system , ' he said			1
' this review will look at welfare reforms overseas , including @entity14 where they have simplified their welfare system by introducing five new payments that replaced eleven old payments			0
' @entity14 's newly reformed payment system now includes a @entity66 payment for those actively looking for work , @entity60 for single parents with children aged under 14 years , and supported living payments for people significantly limited by sickness , injury or disability			2
the suggested changes come during a welfare system overhaul by the government as it awaits the results of a report which reviews the current system mr @entity27 said that @entity0 ’s welfare system was complex in comparison to it ’s neighboring country			2
it currently administers around 20 varying payments with around 50 different supplements that he claimed were costing taxpayers approximately $ 100 billion annually			0
' to make this work requires more than 3500 pages of legislation and more than 640 pages of endnotes to administer the social security system , ' he said			0
however , mr @entity27 acknowledged that similar changes to welfare would be more difficult to administer in @entity0 as it would require support from individual states .			0
