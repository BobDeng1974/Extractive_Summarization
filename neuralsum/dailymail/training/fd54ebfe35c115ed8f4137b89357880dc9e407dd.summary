@entity0 has joined calls for @entity2 to face the axe as hosts of the 2018 @entity5 as part of tougher sanctions over the shooting down of @entity10 flight @entity9 over eastern @entity11 @entity0 has joined calls for @entity2 to lose the right to host the 2018 @entity5 as part of tougher sanctions over the shooting down of flight @entity15 over eastern @entity11			1
the deputy prime minister has said it was ' unthinkable ' at present that the tournament could go ahead in the country blamed by the @entity21 for supplying arms to separatist rebels accused of causing the deaths of all 298 on board the @entity10 flight			1
world football governing body @entity27 has this week rejected calls from some @entity30 politicians for @entity2 to be boycotted			1
the organisation has insisted the tournament could be ' a force for good			0
' but mr @entity0 told @entity34 that allowing the tournament to go ahead in @entity2 without a change of course by president @entity38 would make the world look ' so weak and so insincere ' in its condemnation of @entity42 's annexation of @entity43 and support for the rebels			1
the @entity46 has added another 15 individuals and 18 entities to the list of those subject to asset freezes and ambassadors in @entity52 are expected to extend the punitive actions to state - owned banks ' access to capital markets and to the arms and energy sectors			0
mr @entity0 said however that sporting events should also be part of the package of measures - including the cancellation of @entity2 's first @entity64 , which is due to take place in @entity66 in october			1
mr @entity0 said the threat of withdrawing the @entity5 would be ' a very potent political and symbolic sanction '			1
' if there 's one thing that @entity38 cares about , as far as i can see , it 's his sense of status			0
' maybe reminding him that you ca n't retain the same status in the world if you ignore the rest of the world , maybe that will have some effect on his thinking			0
' he did not rule out the @entity82 as an alternative host given its recent history of putting on successful global sporting events			0
' we 've got the stadiums , we 've got the infrastructure , and we 've got the public backing and enthusiasm to host it , ' he said			0
' that 's a decision for other people			0
but i 'm not saying this just as a , sort of , @entity82 land grab to snatch the @entity5 from under @entity38 's nose			2
' football 's world governing body @entity27 this week ruled out calls from some @entity30 politicians for @entity2 to be boycotted , insisting the tournament could be ' a force for good he backed @entity106 's criticism of a @entity108 deal to supply warships to @entity2 , saying it would be ' wholly inappropriate ' for it to proceed in the present circumstances			1
@entity112 has accused the prime minister of hypocrisy , with mps questioning continued @entity82 military exports despite an embargo and donations to the conservatives by wealthy @entity2			2
' whilst i can entirely understand that the @entity108 may have entered into that contract with the @entity2 in entirely different circumstances , it is wholly inappropriate to go ahead with that now , ' he said			1
former @entity125 chairman @entity124 said it was ' beyond belief ' that @entity2 should be allowed to host the 2018 @entity5 ' and as you know , the prime minister has reviewed the outstanding licenses that we have got to make sure that we deliver what we unilaterally announced back in march , which was that there would be no exports from @entity82 of arms products which could in any way fuel or fan the flames of the conflict in @entity11			1
' he said he had been assured by business secretary @entity142 that ' great care ' was taken to check the remaining licences			0

the call was also joined by former @entity125 chairman @entity124 , who said it was ' beyond belief ' that mr @entity38 should be allowed to host the @entity5			1
he said : ' when you look at the way he milked the @entity159 for all it was worth , there 's no question he sees it for himself , and for his prestige , as a huge gain			0
' the idea that the world should afford @entity2 that prestige is beyond belief			2
' i do n't know how many people have to get shot out of the skies before people say enough is enough			0
' pressure on mr @entity106 over @entity2 donations was added to by the widow of murdered spy @entity176 , who said he should return the tennis cash			2
@entity82 has denied that the announcement of a public inquiry into his death and possible @entity2 involvement - in a reversal of previous policy - was linked to efforts to turn the screw on @entity42			2
mrs @entity176 told the newspaper : ' if @entity106 does n't want to appear like he is being bought , i think he should return this money			0
