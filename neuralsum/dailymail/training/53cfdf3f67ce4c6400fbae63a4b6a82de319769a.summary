by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 19:02 est , 11 september 2012 @entity1 was heckled by union activists yesterday after supporting the government ’s decision to impose a pay freeze on state workers			1
speaking at the @entity8 , the @entity7 faced shouts of ‘ shame on you ’ after admitting he would not reverse the freeze			1
later the @entity8 voted overwhelmingly to start planning the ‘ practicalities ’ of the first general strike in @entity14 since 1926			1
scroll down to see the video @entity16 's @entity1 told the @entity8 conference in @entity18 that securing jobs was more important than big pay rises for the public sector mr @entity1 , who is a member of the two biggest unions , @entity22 and @entity23 , refused to support the clamour from the party ’s union backers to reject the pay freeze			1
public sector workers who earn £ 21,000 or more are subject to a two - year freeze , while local government workers are subject to a three - year freeze			1
official figures show the average public sector worker with a full - time job earns £ 28,668 , compared with £ 24,787 in the private sector			2
during a question - and - answer session at the annual conference in @entity18 , the biggest cheer went to @entity40 , 49 , a youth services worker from @entity41 , who criticised mr @entity1 and @entity16 leader @entity42 for supporting the freeze , and spoke of the daily struggle she faces to make ends meet			1
mrs @entity40 , who has four children , said thousands of care workers , dinner ladies and teaching assistants were in a similar situation to her			0
she said : ‘ what is the response from our @entity16 ? why is it we hear you [ @entity1 ] and @entity42 talk about supporting this @entity55 pay freeze when i ’m having to make hardline decisions			1
unions are threatening more strike action in opposition to the government 's spending cuts and job losses			1
‘ we are fighting to makes ends meet			0
no new school uniform , whether or not i can pay my heating bills , whether or not i can choose to buy food			0
‘ how on earth do you expect to get the support of hundreds of thousands of public service workers when you continue to repeat that position ? ’ but mr @entity1 ignored her plea , insisting that the pay freeze is the only sensible option during the longest and deepest downturn for more than a century , prompting jeers from union members			2
‘ when you are losing hundreds of thousands of jobs , we ca n’t with credibility say the first priority is more pay for existing workers when hundreds of thousands of people are losing their jobs , ’ he said			0
‘ that is the reality			0
i want things to be done in a fairer way but i do n’t think we can argue pay before jobs			0
we have got to say jobs before pay			0
’ mr @entity1 , who joked about his status as one of @entity14 ’s most annoying mps , also criticised the plans by unions to co-ordinate devastating strike action in the coming months			2
he said : ‘ i ’m sure the last thing that the vast majority of trade union members want at times of such uncertainty in our economy is strikes			2
it is not what we want			0
it is not what the public want			0
’ ' we are at our best fighting back ' @entity117 , executive policy director of unite mr @entity1 added : ‘ when @entity121 ministers warn they will have to act and legislate if they are to see a return to the unrest of the 1980s what we are really seeing is @entity126 itching to provoke a row about strikes so they can blame the stalling recovery on trade union members and working people			1
’ but later , after a heated debate , union members cheered enthusiastically after controversially agreeing to start plotting the logistics of a nationwide walkout in protest at spending cuts			2
if it goes ahead , a general strike would wipe out vital services , with workers including teachers , prison guards , firemen , nurses , dinner ladies and paramedics likely to walk out			1
yesterday ’s vote is a huge embarrassment for @entity16 as the motion was supported by its biggest donor , @entity22			2
latest figures show that between april and june , @entity22 handed over £ 840,725 , equal to more than a quarter of all the money the party received			0
@entity117 , executive policy director of @entity22 , insisted it would be ‘ a betrayal of our responsibilities ’ if unions did not support the strike plan			1
‘ we are at our best fighting back , roaring like lions , not cowering in corners , ’ he said			0
video : unison delegate @entity40 demands to know why @entity1 supports policy of public sector pay freezes			0
