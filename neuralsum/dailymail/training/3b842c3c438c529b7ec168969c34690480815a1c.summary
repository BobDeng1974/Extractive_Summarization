by @entity0 published : 11:07 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 13:36 est , 12 february 2013 this incredible picture shows the body of a two - headed fire salamander which has just been donated to a @entity5 university			2
the bizarre mutant lived for just six months in the collection of a private breeder who tried to feed it through both mouths			1
it 's body was donated to the @entity14 in @entity15			1
on me heads , son ! this two - headed fire salamander was donated to @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity5 he was never headed for anything : the poor bicephalous creature was donated by a private breeder who had tried to keep it alive by feeding it through both mouths the condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly , with two - headedness described specifically by the terms bicephaly or dicephaly			1
each head of a polycephalic animal has its own brain , and they somehow share control of the organs and limbs , though the specific structure of the connections varies			2
such animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion , with the brains ' arguing ' with each other leading some specimens to simply zig - zag without getting anywhere			2
in snakes , each head may attack and even attempt to swallow the other			0
pin head : dr @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 at @entity14 , takes a look at the dual - headed salamande , which was just six months old when it died fire salamanders are probably the best - known salamander species in @entity57 and are native to forests in the centre and south of the continent			1
they can have incredibly long lifespans , with one specimen living for more than 50 years in the @entity65 , a @entity5 natural history museum			0
their unusual name is believed to stem from old tales of the amphibians , which sometimes hide within holes and crevices in damp wood and tree trunks			0
when woodsmen cut down such wood to make fires in the forest , heat would force any salamanders hiding within to dart away			0
legend : fire salamanders were once believed to be born from flames after people saw them emerging from logs which they had cut for use as fire wood			0
one imagines what they would have thought of this beast this gave them the appearance of ' crawling from within the flames ' and led to the belief that they were formed from fire			0
this double - headed salamander was pictured last week as it was handed over to researchers at @entity14			1
just six months old when it died , it was born into the collection of a private lizard breeder who had attempted to raise the animal by feeding both heads separately .			1
