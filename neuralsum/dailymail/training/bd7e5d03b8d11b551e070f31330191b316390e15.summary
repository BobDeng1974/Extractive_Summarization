the little rockhopper penguin has finally reached the top of the cliff			1
it has been a bit of a struggle , all those jumps from edge to edge , all those setbacks when big waves pull him down again into the sea			1
but now he can rest and let the wind ruffle the tufts of yellow feathers above his eyes			2
bird is the word : the @entity20 are home to an astonishing population of gentoo penguins and behind him , in stark counterpoint to this everyday routine of a bird colony , rises the dramatic steel cross of the @entity29 memorial , a reminder that just a few miles across these waters the destroyer was hit by an @entity35 missile with the loss of the lives of 20 men			2
it is a moment that could sum up the @entity20			2
for although life would have probably gone on pretty much the same for the rockhoppers and all the other wildlife creatures , it would have changed forever for the islanders had the @entity45 invasion succeeded in 1982			1
back through three decades : the memorial at @entity48 remembers the @entity50 dead of that key battle instead it was defeated by the @entity53 which sailed 8,000 miles to achieve victory in the @entity55			1
the price was 255 @entity50 and 655 @entity45 dead , with hundreds wounded on both sides			2
today in this peaceful and pristine landscape , it is hard to imagine how fiercely battle raged in places like @entity63 , @entity48 , @entity64 and the hills around the capital @entity67			1
at the same time , though , you never feel far from some legacy of the war			1
it is there , of course , as soon as you arrive at @entity75 airport and its adjoining military base , where 1300 servicemen and women are stationed to guarantee the security of this overseas territory			2
it is there in the discreet little leaflet you are handed at immigration reminding visitors in @entity87 and @entity88 not to remove anything from battlefields or display any @entity45 flags			2
and it is certainly there in the minefields which still border the main road - although they are now all clearly marked and cordoned off			1
light and breezy : @entity67 is full of colourful houses which give it a bright complexion in @entity67 , there is a fine official memorial			1
but perhaps even more touching is the special wood with a tree planted for every @entity50 life lost			2
in @entity63 , there is the @entity50 cemetery which commemorates not just those buried there but their comrades who died at sea			2
in the @entity45 cemetery in @entity118 , there are rows of white crosses , more than half of them for conscripts who were not given dog tags , marked @entity121 – known only unto @entity122			2
it is almost impossible not to be moved by these places			2
families from both sides come to the islands , as do veterans - not only to pay their respects to the fallen , but sometimes also to seek comfort for themselves			1
you can see how consolation might be found here			0
the beauty of the @entity20 lies not in its scenery - which , apart from its ‘ stone runs ’ - dramatic cascades of huge rocks sweeping down the hillsides - is generally pretty bleak and unexciting			1
feathered friends : the islands are home to over 200 bird species , including adorable geese instead it is to be found in the coastal crags and the lovely beaches , in the clear ever - changing light and in the surrounding waters , dark navy in one spot , @entity153 turquoise in another			1
then there is the wildlife : seals , sealions , dolphins , orca , even a passing whale if you are lucky			1
and thousands and thousands of birds from 200 species , including five kinds of penguin			0
and this is birdwatching made easy - no hanging about for hours in hides or endlessly fiddling with binoculars			0
@entity171 geese leisurely cross the road in front of your car			0
albatross chicks let you stand within a few feet without batting an eyelid			0
one day i had a couple of caracara hawks playing ‘ @entity182 ’s footsteps ’ behind me , tailing me down a hillside , freezing when i stopped and turned - and then following me again when i moved			0
if you sit patiently in certain areas , curious young gentoo penguins will waddle up to peck your bootlace or even nibble at an outstretched hand			0
shards of the old world : @entity67 plays host to @entity192 ( left ) , and even red phone boxes at times it seems the wildlife is actually competing for your attention			1
on a choppy but exhilarating boat crossing to @entity200 we spotted dozens of albatross , petrels and cormorants in a great feeding and fishing frenzy			0
and just as i was gawping at this spectacle , a school of dolphins appeared , swooping under the boat and leaping out of the water			0
it was as if they were all claiming ‘ look at me ’ , ‘ no look at me ’ , ‘ no @entity215 , over here please ’			0
@entity200 was my only boat trip , as most inter-island travel is done by plane - for the simple reason that the @entity20 archipelago is the size of @entity223 , and that getting from @entity67 in the east to , say , @entity225 in the west , might be a 50 - minute flight with stop - offs as residents return to their far flung ‘ settlements ’ , home from a shopping trip or a family party , or a saturday - night date in @entity67			1
on one flight , i am the only passenger in the ten - seater @entity236 plane			0
echoes of @entity238 : @entity67 holds ties to @entity240 via a twinning relationship with @entity242 so i sit up front and chat to @entity244 the pilot , who tells me : ' people see the islands as a speck on an atlas			1
so when they get here , they ’re amazed at the scale			0
' normally white - knuckled at the slightest bump of turbulence , i am astounded at just how much i enjoy these flights - skimming over the water at a couple of hundred feet on one ; soaring above the clouds on another ; taking off from a grass airstrip from which a cow has just been shooed ; watching my hosts put up a windsock and radio a visibility report to the pilot			0
taking the air route : many journeys between the islands are flown by little @entity274 aircraft almost everything about the @entity20 could be described as hardy : the planes , the all - terrain vehicles , the vegetation , the sheep , the wildlife			1
the same goes for the people : resourceful , resilient , often doing two jobs , sometimes a little reserved initially , but eventually warm and welcoming			0
and although on some days the wind can whip up from the @entity286 and penetrate five layers of clothing , there is no shortage of home comforts and good food			0
the upland goose pate is delicious , the squid some of the best i ’ve ever tasted and the baking for ‘ @entity295 ’ – once a break for sheep shearers , now another word for elevenses – could have held its own at any @entity301 fair			0
there are around 2,500 islanders now , the majority living in @entity67 , which has brightly painted houses , a promenade , a fine cathedral and several lively cafes and pubs with signs in the window saying ‘ @entity313 ’			1
it feels rather like an old - style @entity87 seaside town			0
a shadow still falls : minefields still exist in the @entity20 - though they are carefully marked despite its fervent patriotism – only three people voted no in last year ’s referendum about staying @entity50 – it would be a mistake to think of the place as an isolated ‘ @entity238 ’			1
economic success with fishing licences and the discovery of oil mean that , at the last count , there were 60 different nationalities on the islands			1
even in ‘ @entity335 ’ - the word for everywhere outside @entity67 - you will be guaranteed as fascinating a conversation with your hosts as with your fellow guests			1
@entity340 ( 020 8622 8444 ; www.journeylatinamerica.co.uk ) offers an 11 - day @entity20 itinerary which features three nights in @entity343 ( in @entity344 ) and seven nights in the @entity20			0
prices start at £ 4,095 per person based on two sharing , and include flights from @entity350 , all transfers , comfortable mid-range @entity353 accommodation and excursions in the @entity20			0

the @entity55 archipelago will always be associated with the 1982 war
but wildlife and rugged scenery are the main reasons to visit the islands
@entity67 is full of links to @entity238 , and is twinned with @entity242 in @entity240
