by @entity0 published : 11:18 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 02:36 est , 4 september 2013 when his airline lost his father 's luggage , @entity1 took to @entity5 to complain			1
but instead of griping to his friends and one or two followers about @entity9 , the businessman paid to have his tweet promoted - sending it to the top of @entity9 's @entity5 feed and the feeds of related companies across the world			1
under his handle @ @entity20 , mr @entity1 's promoted tweet read : ' do n't fly @ @entity21			1
their customer service is horrendous			2
' complaint : @entity1 's tweet has now been removed , but not before it attracted tens of thousands of views mr @entity1 bought the promoted tweet through @entity5 's self - service ad platform for an undisclosed sum of money			1
he then followed up his initial message with a series of posts criticising the airline for losing his parents ' luggage on their weekend trip from @entity39 to @entity40			0
' @entity21 is the worst airline ever			0
lost my luggage & ca n't even track it down			0
absolutely pathetic ' he wrote			0
this was followed with : ' thanks for ruining my @entity48 business trip # britishairways			0
i should n't have flown @ @entity49			0
never flying with you again			0
' promoted tweets are usually bought by advertisers who want to reach a wider audience , and who pay for the message to appear in high prominence in the @entity5 feed of relevant companies			1
they also appear in search results for a promoted trend and in some cases on users ' timelines , while still acting as normal messages that can be retweeted by anyone			1
but mr @entity1 's tweet , which targeted @entity70 and @entity71 markets related to @entity9 , did the exact opposite of advertising the airline			1
the airline took four hours to respond to mr @entity1 via a direct message on the social networking site that read : ' sorry for the delay in responding , our twitter feed is open 09:00 - 17:00 gmt. please @entity82 [ direct message ] your baggage ref and we 'll look into this			2
' delay : @entity9 lost mr @entity1 's parents ' luggage during their trip from @entity39 to @entity40 but the tweet had already been read by thousands of viewers , according to aviation marketing cosultants @entity91 , and within six hours had gained more than 25,000 impressions on @entity5 - not including its coverage on popular blogs such as @entity95 , which first reported the story			1
they blamed the delay on its @entity5 feed only being open ' 0900 - 1700 gmt , ' rather than 24 hours , and asked the customer to send over his luggage information in a direct message			1
a spokesperson for the airline said : ' we would like to apologise to the customer for the inconvenience caused			0
we have been in contact with the customer and the bag is due to be delivered today			0
' @entity109 , senior vice president of marketing at @entity110 , tweeted : ' interesting ; a disgruntled customer is buying a promoted tweet slamming a brand where they had a bad experience			2
that 's a new trend itself ! ' in 2009 , @entity118 and his band , @entity120 , took on @entity121 in 2009 with the video @entity123 detailing how @entity121 had failed to reimburse @entity118 after his guitar was broken in 2008			2
and a complaint letter sent to @entity126 , complaining about the food on @entity129 planes , also went viral in 2009			2
@entity126 himself phoned the author of the letter for his ' constructive if tongue - in - cheek ' email and invited him to select the food and wines for future @entity129 flights .			0

businessman pays ' undisclosed sum ' for complaint against @entity9 to be promoted on @entity5
@entity5 gained more than 25,000 impressions within six hours
commentators say promoted tweets herald new trend in online *feedback*
