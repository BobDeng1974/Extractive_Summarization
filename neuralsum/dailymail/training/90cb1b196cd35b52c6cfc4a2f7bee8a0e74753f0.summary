@entity0 are set to secure @entity2 defender @entity1 on a six month loan deal			1
the @entity4 can activate a buyout clause at the end of the season should they wish to			2
after his breakthrough at @entity19 , the centre back moved to @entity10 in the summer of 2012			2
despite a strong start at his new club , @entity1 eventually fell out of favour , and was loaned to @entity23 last summer in a bid to get more playing time			2
@entity0 are close to signing @entity10 defender @entity1 on loan until the end of the season did that not work out ? so far , @entity1 only made five appearances for @entity33 's side in the first half of this season , and three of those were as a substitute			1
that means he 's only player about 200 minutes of league football since last season			2
injuries have held him back , but even bad luck can not hide the fact that he was fourth choice centre back , behind @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
@entity1 ( left ) has only made five appearances for @entity23 since joining on loan from @entity10 this term so @entity0 are n't getting a superstar ? not quite			1
but there are similarities between @entity1 and the @entity4 ' star signing of the summer @entity56			1
both were tipped for great things , but did n't quite make the cut for the highest level early in their careers			0
in his first season at @entity10 , @entity1 established himself in the starting line up , playing a full ninety minutes in 31 of the 34 @entity16 fixtures			1
his form paid off , and @entity67 nominated him for the @entity69 squad which toured the @entity70 in 2013			0
the tour was a bit of a disaster , and many young players like @entity1 have not played for their country since			0
in the following season , @entity1 also lost his place in @entity78 's @entity10 side			1
@entity81 's ( top ) form has dipped since his leverkusen debut season where he played 31 of 34 league games tell me more about the way he plays			0
at 6 ' 4 , @entity1 may come to share the nickname ' @entity87 ' with his compatriot per @entity87			0
like @entity87 , @entity1 may be big , but he will not strike the fear of @entity90 into opposing strikers			0
at his best , he is a gifted all round defender , with excellent positioning and relatively secure heading and tackling			1
he can play with both feet , and can mark equally well man to man or zonally , although he can be prone to losses of concentration			2
the 6 ' 4 defender ( centre ) has excellent positional sense but can be prone to losses of concentration will @entity0 be desperate to buy him in the summer ? that depends on two things			1
firstly , how well he settles , and secondly , how much faith @entity103 shows in him			0
if @entity1 gets regular game time , he is definitely up to becoming a strong addition to @entity0 's defence , and well worth his £ 4m price tag			1
if he is underused , as has been at @entity23 , he may struggle to fight for his place , and will probably return to @entity69			0
valued at £ 4million , @entity1 ( right ) could prove a strong addition to @entity0 's defence if given opportunities anything else we should know ? @entity1 gave the nation something to laugh about when he embarrassed @entity117 presenter @entity11			1
during the pre-match warm up , the defender 's misplaced pass struck @entity11 in the head while she was speaking into the camera			0
it was the second time @entity11 had been hit by a loose ball on live tv .			0

@entity0 are close to signing @entity10 's @entity1 on loan
defender will join until the end of the season , with an option to buy after
valued at £ 4million he is a gifted all round defender at his best , but can be prone to losses of concentration
