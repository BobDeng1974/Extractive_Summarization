by @entity0 published : 03:19 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 10:14 est , 19 october 2012 earlier this week – an unsociable sunday evening as it happens - i agreed to a request i 'd received to be interviewed by an @entity5 radio show , the @entity6			1
its producers were doggedly persistent in pursuing me for over a month , insisting that their hosts were dying to have me on their show			1
i 'm currently finishing my first book and as a result refusing all media requests			2
nonetheless the producers ' persistence paid off and i agreed to talk to the show hosts on wednesday morning ( @entity5 time )			1
scroll down to listen ... when @entity0 , left , and former @entity20 @entity19 , right , both appeared on @entity5 's @entity6 show , it was not quite the meeting of minds @entity25 had hoped for the time difference meant that i stayed up until 11.30pm tuesday evening in order for the interview to be conducted live on their @entity30 - based show			1
no one told me that former @entity20 and @entity5 x factor judge @entity19 would also be part of the interview			1
i , like most @entity37 women , have always been a massive @entity20 fan – naively assuming they were pro-women			1
all i can say about my encounter with @entity19 is this : so much for @entity40			2
on hearing i was about to join her on the show , she immediately snapped : ' have you seen her though ? she 's not as attractive as she thinks she is			1
' on learning she 'd be talking to me live , she immediately halted what i can only assume was the start of a negative diatribe - aimed squarely at me			2
' on learning my husband and i maintain a healthy weight by getting on the scales each week , @entity19 declared my marriage was crap ' throughout the interview , i had difficulty hearing the host - @entity55 when i later listened to the show on the internet , i found her comments to be genuine , warm and friendly , which is more than can be said for twice - married mum of three @entity19			1
it 's only on the playback that i 've realised what the viewers heard			1
astonishingly the former @entity20 could n't get past the fact that she thought i assumed i was beautiful			2
never one to back down , @entity19 - whose three daughters each have different fathers - repeatedly asked me if this was genuinely the case			0
or , demonstrating that she considered me wholly unattractive , whether i 'd said it just to cause a stir			0
despite plugging her @entity75 contract and , i 'd imagine , promoting her judging role on @entity77 , she incredulously asked why i had appeared on @entity80 's recent celebrity big brother series			1
now that i 've listened to her patronising posturing i can respond to her directly : the same reasons as you take part in the shows you appear on @entity19 , to pay the bills			0
fortunately , @entity5 listeners rallied round , taking @entity19 to task and criticising her for repeatedly asking me if i was beautiful			1
two out of the three callers whose views were broadcast live on air were 100 per cent on my side – which is more than can be said for @entity19			0
for it 's fair to say that @entity19 did n’t take a shine to me – and things only got worse between us			2
on learning that my husband and i maintain a healthy weight by both getting on the scales each week , @entity19 declared that my marriage was ' crap '			0
her microphone was turned up , ensuring her views took centre stage , and her venom spewed forth all over me			0
i was flabbergasted by her vitriolic response			0
weight however , is clearly a sensitive issue for @entity19			0
according to a report in @entity115 this week , she has also slapped @entity116 for labelling her fat			0
it is fair to say that @entity19 did n’t take a shine to @entity0 from the start of the conversation live on air ... and things only got worse i 'd like to think i had the last laugh , for however confident @entity19 is about ' for better or for worse ' and her husband loving her for her curves , later on that day she was photographed ‘ ' unawares ' with her personal trainer			0
i had always assumed that a female role model with her global profile - and a straight - talking working class girl , just like me – would be the first to applaud me			0
sadly @entity19 is far from the @entity40 role model i thought she was			0
