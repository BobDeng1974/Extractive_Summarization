the main man ? @entity11 are being urged to bid for out - of - favour @entity9 left - back @entity8 @entity11 will not move for @entity42 in january			1
manager @entity43 remains a fan but @entity46 's £ 15million valuation and @entity42 's age , 29 , do not make good business sense			0
@entity42 would have to ask for a transfer for the deal to have any chance of being revived and that will not happen			0
@entity46 will now look at fresh talks over a new deal for the @entity56 international			0
@entity11 's concern over @entity8 is the fact he has n't played many games , having appeared just four times in @entity61 this season			1
however , he returned to training yesterday and is fit to play			0
no longer required : @entity46 's @entity42 is not @entity11 's principal left - back target @entity11 have watched @entity65 at @entity66 , who @entity9 also like , and @entity67 at @entity68 while @entity69 of @entity70 is a talent they would like to sign			1

the 21 - year - old is close to agreeing terms with @entity17 to replace @entity105 , while @entity18 have also approached his advisors as they consider a successor for @entity108			1
@entity19 has been impressive at @entity109 where he is under contract until 2015			1
@entity15 expect to lose @entity112 next month with @entity114 favourites , @entity111 has been in good form but @entity15 are planning ahead and they recognise the potential for a lot of new recruits from the @entity119			0
@entity120 , who @entity15 brought in from @entity121 , may be allowed out on loan over the next few weeks depending on injuries			2
@entity125 's @entity101 manager @entity124 is among those keen to take the 18 - year - old winger			0
in demand : @entity109 's 20 year - old keeper @entity19 , right , is wanted by @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity18 the future of @entity131 striker @entity130 could become clearer later today with @entity132 and @entity133 keen			1

striker @entity171 is wanted by both @entity173 clubs and @entity174 among many others and if anyone bids £ 25million then @entity131 may yet contemplate a deal but a summer exit is more likely			2
goal threat : @entity133 are considering moves for @entity182 pair @entity181 and @entity183 @entity133 , meanwhile , have several other striker targets			2
they were due to hold a meeting with @entity182 's sporting director @entity186 at the weekend who is looking to offload @entity181 and @entity183 but the meeting was put off with @entity189 and @entity12 reputedly speaking to @entity186 instead			2

' several major @entity211 clubs playing in the @entity215 were informed and the situation should settle down within the next 10 days			0
lack of opportunities : @entity72 's @entity201 could be on his way out of @entity202 in january ' you should know that @entity201 was not on the list of players who can play in the @entity215 with @entity72 , so he is free to play in the competition with another club			1
' @entity201 , although a favourite of @entity228 , has struggled to make an impression on @entity72 's first team this season			1
@entity72 , meanwhile , are continuing to gather information on @entity233 at @entity82			0
@entity228 has made no secret of wanting a striker , with @entity88 's @entity236 also in his thinking			2

hazard is on loan at @entity248 but the younger brother of @entity250 could join @entity251 when the transfer window reopens			0
loan star ? @entity243 have confirmed they want @entity72 's @entity244 , brother of @entity250 , on loan which former young @entity255 player has been given an allowance by his agent in a bid to stop his frivolous spending ? the final straw came when the player in question bought himself a brand new car for £ 26,000 , even though he does n't drive			1

there has been much clamour in their native @entity272 for @entity265 to link up with @entity274 at @entity17			1
@entity131 would also move for @entity274 if they felt there was a chance of him leaving @entity95			1
however , the two friends will come face to face in the @entity215 next year			0
@entity281 , @entity265 ’s father , said : ' i would like to see @entity265 and @entity274 playing together , but there is nothing at all			1

going nowhere : @entity265 's dad has poured cold water over rumours his son is off to @entity17 ' we will see two great games			1
i do n't know if i will visit @entity274 's home , but i will go to hotel for sure to say hello to him			2
