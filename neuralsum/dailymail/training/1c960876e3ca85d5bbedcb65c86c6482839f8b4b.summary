@entity0 has caused yet more outrage over its decision to cut a tribute for the victims of the @entity6 2005 terrorist bombings from its @entity8 coverage by explaining it was n't tailored for the @entity11 audience			1
a tribute song , @entity13 by singer @entity14 , and an accompanying dance was edited out of @entity0 's coverage in favour of a bland @entity19 interview with @entity21 swimmer @entity20 ' our programming is tailored for the @entity11 audience , ' spokesman @entity22 simply explained after outrage over the weekend			1
' it 's a tribute to [ producer ] @entity27 that it required so little editing			0
' the excuse comes despite the fact that the devastating attack - which killed 52 people and left many with life - changing injuries - was mourned across the globe and claimed the life of a @entity37			1
ignored : @entity0 has sparked outrage by cutting a tribute performance to the victims of the 2005 @entity6 terrorist bombings in its coverage of the @entity43 cut : the moving tribute included a performance by singer @entity14 of @entity13 @entity47 - born @entity46 had moved from the @entity48 to live with his fiance in @entity6 and was killed in one of the four explosions on public transport on july 7 , 2005 - attacks known as ' 7/7 '			1
the latest excuse will no doubt annoy @entity11 , who @entity0 suggested would not be interested in a tribute to victims just because the tragedy did not occur in their country			1
' can you imagine the @entity60 opting to cut out a tribute to 9/11 at a future @entity21 held in the @entity62 because it was n't " tailored for a @entity64 audience " ? ' @entity65 fumed			2
' if that happened ... the switchboards at @entity67 would have blown a fuse			0
' the segment 's choreographer and dancer @entity70 said he was ' disheartened and disappointed ' that @entity0 cut the entire segment , while his director @entity74 branded it ' disgraceful '			2
victim : @entity46 , who grew up in @entity37 , was one of the 52 victims killed in the 7/7 bombings in @entity6			0
he is pictured with his fiancee @entity78 moving montage : the faces of spectators ' loved ones who have passed away , including the victims of 7/7 , were flashed up on big screens around the @entity85 and on tv @entity87 very quickly became awash with comments demanding to know why the broadcaster - which has exclusive rights to broadcasting in the @entity11 - chose to cut out the performance			1
@entity94 said : ' @entity0 cut tribute to the 7/7 victims from # olympicceremony coverage , shocking considering we honour the 9/11 victims at every opportunity			2
' @entity101 tweeted : ' @entity0 skilled a tribute to servicemen and the 7/7 victims to show @entity19 interviewing @entity104			2
@entity106 added : ' so @entity0 cut out our tribute to the 7/7 victims for a stupid interview ! ! rude and disrespectful on so many levels ! ! # openingceremony			1
' @entity0 is known for cutting away for small portions of the opening ceremonies to make way for averts , but @entity11 commentators say they have never heard of it skipping a whole performance before			1
in an earlier statement , @entity0 said : ' we are live streaming every sporting event , all 32 sports and all 302 medals … the opening and closing ceremonies , however , are entertainment spectacles			0
furious : viewers took to @entity87 to voice their disgust at @entity0 's decision to cut the tribute from its coverage angry : many viewers were demanding to know why @entity0 chose to cut an entire performance ' our award - winning production team will present them on a medium that best demonstrates their grandeur and majesty , and at a time when friends and family are able to gather together to watch , which is in prime time			1
' the @entity60 had introduced the segment by saying : ' ladies and gentlemen , please pause silent for our memorial wall for friends and family who ca n't be here tonight			0
' the excitement of that moment in @entity152 seven years ago when @entity153 won the games was tempered the next day with sorrow from the events of july 7 that year			0
a wall of remembrance for those no longer here to share in this event			0
' the screens then showed a montage of images of spectators ' loved ones who have passed away , including the late fathers of @entity27 , the show 's director and @entity171 chief @entity170			0
dancers dressed in red , representing the struggle between life and death , were picked out by a spotlight as the powerful vocals of @entity14 pierced the air with @entity13			1
this was followed by the procession of the 204 countries taking part and the lighting of the cauldron to signal the start of the @entity187			0
' horrendous ' : it was replaced with an interview by @entity19 ( left ) with swimmer @entity20 , who is pictured right after placing third in the men 's 200m butterfly heat on monday it is not the only controversy surrounding a tribute at the opening ceremony , after it emerged the @entity200 had declined a request to hold a moment of silence to acknowledge the 11 @entity204 athletes and coaches killed by @entity207 gunmen at the @entity208 in 1972			1
@entity0 's @entity209 called the decision insensitive during an interview and indicated he would call for his own moment of silence when @entity204 athletes marched into the @entity85 on friday			2
@entity209 ' comments took his bosses by surprise			0
@entity218 , executive producer of the @entity0 's telecast , said this week that @entity209 had n't brought it up with him before the interview			2
as the athletes marched in friday , @entity209 said that @entity200 president @entity222 led a moment of silence for the late @entity204 this week before about 100 people at the @entity226			0
' still , for many , tonight with the world watching is the true time and place to remember those who were lost and how and why they died , ' @entity209 said .			0
