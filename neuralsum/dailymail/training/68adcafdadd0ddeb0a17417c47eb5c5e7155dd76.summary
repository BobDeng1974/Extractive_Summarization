by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 's men 's basketball team have had their world cup campaign turned on its head after they were accused of deliberately losing to @entity6			2
the third - round match against their less - fancied rivals took a stunning turn late in the third quarter when the @entity12 seemingly gave up hope - letting a 15 - point lead slip out of reach - to go down by 91 - 83			1
the stunning eight - point loss puts the @entity12 in a position to avoid playing @entity16 in the world cup quarter final and many believe this was incentive enough for the team to ' tank ' against @entity6			1
' we always , as @entity3 , compete the right way , ' he said			0
when asked whether he accepted that some @entity3 would view the loss with an air of scepticism , @entity42 said : ' people will make up their own minds			1
' ' there 's always going to be speculators			0
i ca n't control what people think			0
' the boomers were chasing a fourth straight victory for the first time in @entity64 history , and for most of the match were cruising before the wheels fell off			1
guard @entity67 shot a team - high 22 points as the @entity12 opened up a 15 - point buffer			1
it was also an opportunity to see highly - rated @entity74 draft pick @entity72 in action , and the 19 - year - old did n't disappoint - scoring 12 points and handing out six assists in his 31 minutes on court			0
despite fielding a second string team @entity3 was still the heavily backed favourites at $ 1.17 @entity3 's @entity72 takes on @entity6 's @entity82 and @entity83 @entity3 's forward @entity23 shoots from the free foul line @entity3 was winning by 15 in the third quarter when the momentum swung in @entity6 's favour the loss means @entity3 will not have to face the @entity16 until the semi finals if they win their way there but an @entity6 charge , led by dynamic young star @entity94 's outstanding 38 - point display , started midway through the third quarter and they cut the lead to just two at the final break			1
the onslaught continued thereafter as @entity3 carelessly gave up the ball , committing 18 turnovers , and played lacklustre defence as the clock wound down in the eight - point loss - prompting the tanking calls			1
sports betting agency @entity106 refunded $ 125,500 in bets placed on the boomers to win the match in light of the allegations			2
the side was an unbackable $ 1.17 to win with @entity6 the $ 5.20 outsiders			0
' punters bet on the @entity3 in good faith not knowing they would be resting a few of their guns and giving their reserves a go , so we think it 's only fair that they get their money back to enjoy over the weekend , ' the agency 's @entity114 said			0
in good faith the betting agency refunded the amounts wagered on the match in light of the allegations former boomer @entity129 defended the tactics and said @entity3 were well within their right to want the best chance of winning a maiden medal			1
' [ it is ] un @entity3 not to give yourself the best chance to medal , ' he wrote on @entity140			2
' no medals given on pool placings			0
pathway to final 4 is the key			0
' ' there 's still games to be played that will determine the outcome of the pool			0
@entity3 is chasing its first medal in the history of the world cup social media users have called the match ' un @entity3 ' a @entity155 likened the tactics to those employed by @entity3 's cricket side a defiant @entity6 stole the game away in the third quarter when pressed about allegations of premeditated tanking tactics post match , @entity42 responded : ' nobody likes losing			1
( the loss ) does n't guarantee us third spot he said the team had ' no control over that game			0
' ' that was always the case coming in			0
' securing third spot would mean @entity3 would avoid a quarter - final show down against @entity16 and conveniently put them in a position to challenge for a maiden medal at the tournament			1
former @entity3 basketball great @entity129 said if tanking was on the agenda , it was something that he supported in an effort for the boomers to win a maiden world cup medal			1
' [ it is ] un @entity3 not to give yourself the best chance to medal , ' he wrote on @entity140			2
' no medals given on pool placings			0
pathway to final 4 is the key			0
' but most shared a different view to heal on social media - with one @entity140 user comparing the match to @entity3 's infamous underarm bowling scandal			2
the strategy employed by the then captain @entity199 gave @entity200 no hope of winning when his brother @entity202 bowled an underarm ball on the final play of the match			2
if the @entity12 finish third they will play either @entity208 or @entity200 in the quarter - finals .			1

the boomers were leading until the wheels fell off in the third quarter
the side let a 15 - point lead slip to lose by eight and avoid playing the @entity16
if they finish third in their pool they increase chances of winning a medal
boomers coach @entity42 said he had ' no control ' of the outcome
the side will play either @entity208 or @entity200 in the quarter finals
@entity229 refunded all bets on @entity3 to win the game
