by @entity0 published : 10:14 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 14:00 est , 25 november 2012 for the first time ever , sci - fi epic @entity1 is boldly going where no game has gone before ... and interconnecting a tv programme with an mmo shooter			1
developed by @entity11 for the pc , @entity9 and @entity10 , the series takes place on @entity14 , which is war - ravaged and inhabited by humans and aliens			2
@entity18 it : you are able to select your species before kitting out customisable armour , weapons and abilities it combines the intense action of a third - person shooter with the persistence , scale and customisation of an mmo , while its tv counterpart exudes the scope , story and character - driven drama of a classic sci - fi epic			1
@entity42 , because they exist in a single universe , the show ( to be shown on @entity39 ) and the game influence each other – both evolving over time with actions in both mediums affecting the overarching narrative			1
thankfully , the gameplay has a creative team behind the likes of @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , working on it			1
the result is a wonderfully dark open world , capable of catering for thousands of other live players			0
although mmo game are not renowned for state - of - the - art visuals , @entity1 holds up well across all platforms - its impressive draw distance helping to emphasise the sheer scale of the planet and the monumental war that plagues it			1
there 's also an impressive weather system in place			0
often huge lightning storms can rip you and your vehicles to pieces , suddenly shifting priorities from death count to out - and - out survival			2
@entity74 in sight : the game uses the perspective perhaps best known from the @entity79 series as expected , you can customise your character			2
with each class comes different abilities , such as active camo for the @entity84 and speed boost for the @entity86			0
you can pick to play as either a human or alien , modify your appearance and select and upgrade weapons			0
all weapons , vehicles and artistic direction have been developed in parallel with the series , and as a result , sound and look exactly the same across the mediums			2
hit the road : the world is epic in scale so , thankfully , there are vehicles to make travelling a pleasure playing like a much more refined @entity104 with a dash of @entity106 , there is also a p - v - p mode , which can cater for battles of up to 32 players			1
sadly , it will be next april when we find out if @entity1 ’s gamble pays off			0
but on this evidence , it looks like a sure bet			0
follow @entity116 : @ @entity117 and on @entity118 : @entity119 .			0

*ambitious* series sees mmo interconnected with @entity39 tv programme
game created by team behind likes of @entity50 and @entity52
packed with customisation and 32 - *strong* @entity130 mode
