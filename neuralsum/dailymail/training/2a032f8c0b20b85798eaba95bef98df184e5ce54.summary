by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 1 june 2013 the highlight of @entity3 couturier @entity3 ’s life was not – as you might think – watching lady @entity5 emerge from her wedding carriage wearing the dress he created in 1981			1
it took place in a hospital office in @entity12 on february 4 this year			1
that is the day a @entity15 nurse showed him the blood - test result that proved he was free from prostate cancer			1
every year , more than 40,000 men are diagnosed with the condition			1
last year it killed 11,000			1
survivor : royal couturier @entity3 , was diagnosed - and beat - prostate cancer thanks to his friend @entity24 @entity3 , who has also dressed @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , has opened up about his experience to encourage other men to be tested			1
although some men experience symptoms – such as frequent night urination , problems starting and stopping urinating , or pain – many , including @entity3 , do not			1
indeed , it was only thanks to his friend , theatre impresario sir @entity24 , that he had his prostate investigated at all			1
‘ i had read about prostate cancer for years but , like so many men , ignored it			1
@entity24 , with whom i have worked many times , spoke out about his experience with prostate cancer back in 2009			1
before that , he had kept it a secret from everyone			2
i wrote to him immediately			2
’ the second reason was his imminent 60th birthday			2
‘ then my stepmother phoned saying that my father might have a prostate problem			1
so last november , i made an appointment with my gp			2
’ making perfection : @entity3 applying the finishing touches to princess @entity65 s dress at her wedding in @entity67 in 1981 he was given a @entity69 ( @entity69 ) test , which looks for a protein produced by the cells of the prostate , the male gland surrounding the neck of the bladder , and which releases a fluid component of semen			1
elevated @entity69 levels may indicate a problem with the prostate			1
@entity3 ’s level was 6.9 , so his gp referred him to consultant urologist @entity82 at @entity83 in @entity84 , near @entity3 ’s home			1
‘ ideally a @entity69 reading ought to be under five , ’ says mr @entity82			0
if cancer is suspected , a variety of tests are performed			1
a second blood test showed that @entity3 ’s @entity69 had gone up a little further – to 7.3			1
mr @entity82 also recommended he have a multiparametric mri , with which radiologists are now able to differentiate cancerous from benign tissue			0
he also used the @entity95 system , which grades cancer from one to five , with five being the most serious			2
the final test was a biopsy – where samples of tissue ( or cores ) from the rectum were removed under local anaesthetic to ascertain how much cancer is present			2
unfortunately the tests concluded that @entity3 had an aggressive form of prostate cancer			1
‘ there was a lot apparent in the @entity110 , his @entity95 was high , and most of the biopsy cores had cancer present , ’ says mr @entity82			2
@entity114 won : @entity3 , standing in front of @entity5 's wedding dress at @entity117 , was diagnosed with the most aggressive form of prostate cancer , but was given the all clear this year ‘ i was called into @entity82 ’s office and just froze , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ i know he was talking , but i ’m not sure what he said			0
’ ‘ this numb reaction is quite common , ’ points out mr @entity82			0
a @entity15 nurse was in the room at the time for support			0
‘ that ’s when i realised it was serious , ’ says @entity3			1
controversy exists over whether certain forms of prostate cancer ought to be treated			1
‘ in many cases the risk of side effects from treatment – such as impotence – outweigh the benefits			0
prostate cancer often grows very slowly			1
if it is unlikely to kill the patient within their lifetime , then watching and waiting may be the right approach			0
’ inspiration : @entity24 , spoke of his experience with prostate cancer in 2009 two - thirds of those with low - risk cancer wo n’t have aggressive treatment			1
but @entity3 had very high - risk cancer – where the @entity69 changes fast			1
mr @entity82 recommended keyhole surgery to remove the prostate			2
‘ these days it ’s possible to be very focused in removal , ’ he says			0
@entity3 was adamant that he wanted to go ahead as soon as possible			1
‘ i was n’t too worried about side effects			0
i told @entity82 that i had read what @entity24 wrote			0
he described his impotence with great courage			0
' i am one of 11 , but i did n’t mention it to my nine brothers			0
i told my sister @entity160 just before i went into the @entity161 on december 13 , and my children @entity163 and @entity164 came to look after me			0
’ the prostate is between 2.5cm and 7cm long			2
mr @entity82 used a robot to help him perform the surgery			0
a 2.5cm incision is made just above the belly button , through which the prostate is removed , and then five small incisions – about 8mm long – above the genitals , through which the instruments are passed			2
‘ cutting away the prostate is a delicate operation , ’ he says			2
‘ but we are able to be very specific in separating it from the nerves that allow erection and stop incontinence			0
’ a rare complication – a minute leak from the bladder into the bloodstream – meant that @entity3 had to have a catheter for weeks afterwards			1
from the moment he was given the all - clear , he threw himself into his recovery			0
‘ i felt that i wanted to take charge and decided to be very healthy			0
i now swim outdoors at home every day – for about 20 minutes			0
’ he also drinks a rather alarming green concoction			0
‘ i make up huge juices out of fruit and vegetables – apple , sometimes ginger , cucumber , and some spirulina			0
i have a couple of these every day			0
’ the surgery was a huge success			0
‘ i had to do pelvic - floor exercises – spending a lot of time with a catheter means that you lose muscle tone , ’ he explains			0
he also had a procedure to correct minor incontinence			0
but otherwise , he has not suffered any side effects			2
‘ this is like a second chance			0
and i ’ve told my brothers to get tested immediately			0
