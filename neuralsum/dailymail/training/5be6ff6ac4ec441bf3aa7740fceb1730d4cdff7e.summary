dr @entity0 warns a study that concluded most cases of cancer are the result of bad luck rather than unhealthy lifestyles could be detrimental to people 's outlook on the disease most cases of cancer are just ' bad luck ' , not the result of an unhealthy lifestyle , diet or faulty genes inherited from our parents			1
that at least , is the conclusion of a recent study			2
scientists at the @entity23 found that for two out of three cancer victims , the cumulative effect of random mistakes in genes is to blame for the disease - rather than poor choices about how they lived their lives			1
in the past , studies have estimated that 30 to 40 per cent of cancer cases would be avoided if a people improved their lifestyle			2
here , one doctor argues that blaming cancer on just bad luck will encourage an unhealthy outlook on the disease for many people			1
below , dr @entity0 , an @entity39 consultant specialising in weight loss and upper gastrointestinal surgery , aims to shed some light on the study ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... recent reports seem to have dubbed cancer as just down to ‘ poor luck ’ – something i personally think could be really quite detrimental to many people ’s outlook on the disease			1
that ’s just the media slant			0
however , i ’m hoping i might be able to shed a little bit of light onto this matter			0
firstly , the reports that you have seen will have been based on a recent study from the @entity60 in @entity61			2
the study claims that as many as two thirds of cancer cases are the result of ‘ bad luck ’			1
but what does this really mean ? the study looked at the rate of random mutations in stem cells of various body tissues , as they can be drivers of cancer			2
these mutations are errors that occur in our dna during cell division and replication – the more that these mutations occur , the higher our chances of cancer			0
the researchers looked at 31 types of cancer , analysing the number of stem cell divisions in each type , to work out how much of a risk cell mutations caused			0
for two out of three cancer patients , the cumulative effect of random mistakes in genes is to blame , scientists at @entity23 found what they found was that 65 per cent of the cancers they analysed could be attributed to cell division , while the other 35 per cent could be put down to hereditary or environmental factors			1
however , the study was looking at tissues , not real people , and used computer models to extrapolate the results			0
it was n’t able to categorically say how much lifestyle could actually affect the rate of these mutations – or indeed whether the mutations would go on to cause cancer			0
cancers caused by bad luck : cancers caused by lifestyle : for me , this information is n’t too shocking			1
we ’ve all heard of , or known people whose cancer diagnosis was met with disbelief , because of their enviably healthy and active lifestyle			2
put simply , cancer may indeed strike at random , or as the recent news stories have put it , seem to be ‘ down to bad luck ’			1
but it ’s not quite that simple			0
something many of the news stories have skipped over , is the fact that there are also many types of cancer that can be attributed to other factors – and in some cases , prevented by our own actions			0
we know that if we smoke like a chimney , our chances of getting lung cancer are at a much greater risk , or that excess alcohol can increase our risk of liver cancer			0
we know that viruses transmitted during unprotected sex can increase cervical cancer – which is why we are immunising teenage girls			0
we are hearing more and more often how a diet high in vegetables or fibre can reduce the risk of certain cancers and we know very clearly that obesity increases the risk of cancer too			0
so there are many types of cancer that are clearly influenced by lifestyle			0
what ’s more , i have heard the leading researcher in this study say that he still believes that lifestyle is a very important factor in affecting your cancer risk , as a poor lifestyle could actually increase your risk of those cancer - causing mutations happening			1
so to sum up , while some cancers can be attributed to random dna mutations ( or just plain ‘ bad luck ’ ) , there are many others that can in fact be helped by your efforts to stay fit and healthy			1
my advice to you ? while nobody can guarantee that your healthy lifestyle will safeguard you entirely against cancer , the fact is that by keeping yourself fit and healthy you are helping to not only reduce your risk of getting certain cancers , but you ’re helping to prevent numerous other diseases and illnesses , and helping to give yourself a healthier , more positive and energetic life to boot .			1

dr @entity0 says recent study blaming two in three cases of cancer on bad luck is detrimental to people 's view of the disease
scientists in the @entity202 found in 65 *%* of cases random mistakes in genes is to blame for the disease rather than poor lifestyle choices
but dr @entity209 argues while some cancers do strike out of the blue , ensuring you live a healthy lifestyle , getting plenty of exercise , is still *key*
