@entity0 believes it has a way to extend your electric car 's range through tires that charge the battery as you drive on them			2
unveiled at this year 's @entity8 , the @entity10 concept tires combine thermoelectric and piezoelectric materials that generate electricity as the tire rolls			1
' this tire generates electricity through the action of materials in the tire that capture and transform the energy created by heat when it flexes as it rolls during normal driving conditions , ' @entity0 said in a statement			2
piezoelectric material would also capture energy generated in the normal physical deformation by strain energy harvesting			0
it 's not clear that the tire could produce the type of energy needed to add significant miles to an electric car 's travel radius			0
a study published in 2012 in @entity50 found strain energy harvesting through piezoelectric tire materials was feasible , but the experiment looked to power wireless sensors , not an entire vehicle			0
the company also unveiled another concept that could take drivers off the beaten path			0
showcasing its new @entity61 tires on the @entity63 concept car , @entity0 says the tire design has three tubes that can be inflated or deflated to respond to road conditions			1
high concept : the @entity63 concept car , also unveiled , showcased @entity0 's @entity61 tires , which use three inflating and deflating tubes to transform the tire 's shape to adapt to road conditions the tires could change to provide extra grip during high speed driving , increase fuel economy by lowering resistance and even change shape to control against hydroplaning in snow or rain			1
@entity81 points out that @entity0 has used @entity8 to launch forward - thinking - though not quite market - ready - concepts before , having shown off a tire with two separate rings for different road conditions at last year 's auto show			1
the outer ring of the suv featured a slick surface with grooves to displace water while driving on a paved road while a smaller inner ring had a textured surface for traction off road .			0

the tire company showed off two new concept tires at @entity8
one uses heat - capture to transform friction into extra energy to charge an electric vehicle
the other transforms to respond to changing road conditions
the company has not said how much either is expected to cost or when they might be expected to hit the market
