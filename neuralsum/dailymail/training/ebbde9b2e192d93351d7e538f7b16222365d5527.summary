by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 insists that victory is the only acceptable result for him at @entity5 this week , despite playing in only his second tournament since undergoing major back surgery			1
the 14 - time major champion had been expected to use @entity9 as the next step in his recovery from the operation on a herniated disc			1
a serious challenge for the @entity15 this week appeared beyond even @entity2 ’s superhuman powers			1
but @entity2 was in bullish mood on tuesday morning having spent several days at the scene of one of his greatest victories and was adamant that a fourth @entity5 title is firmly on his mind			1
‘ first ’ came the quick reply			2
asked if anything less than first was unacceptable , @entity2 responded flatly : ‘ that ’s always the case			1
’ woods arrived at @entity9 on saturday afternoon and quickly played a practice round on the course where he won his third @entity5 in 2006 , just two months after his father @entity36 had died of cancer			1
the @entity42 superstar said he also practiced on sunday before taking monday off to rest			1
he clearly likes what he sees flying off the clubface			2
the key to @entity2 ’s confidence is being pain - free , which he says has not been the case for many years			1
@entity2 said emerging unscathed from his comeback tournament at @entity51 in @entity52 last week was a ‘ big boost ’ , despite missing the cut			1
previous : the 38 - year - old has won @entity5 on three previous occasions , in 2000 , 2005 and 2006 ‘ it ’s getting better , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ there ’s no pain			2
i came back and hit it as hard as i want to hit it			2
i ’m getting stronger and faster			2
that ’s only going to continue			2
he added : ‘ i ’m not quite at the level i think i can be at in terms of explosion through the golf ball but i ’m pretty darn close			2
’ woods pointed out that arguably his greatest victory had come on the back of serious surgery			2
he stunned the world by winning the @entity73 at @entity74 despite having undergone keyhole surgery on his left knee just weeks before , while also suffering from stress fractures in his left leg and a ruined anterior cruciate ligament			2
on the mend : @entity2 is still recovering from undergoing major back surgery focus : woods practices at @entity9 ‘ i ’ve been in circumstances like this before , ’ @entity2 said referring to 2008			1
‘ i had surgery after the masters and i did n’t play until the @entity73			0
i did n’t break 50 for nine holes before but i won the @entity73 with a broken leg and torn acl			1
’ @entity2 admitted that this injury , however , had been the toughest he had ever had to deal with			1
so tough , in fact , that it could have forced him to retire from the game			0
‘ there was point in time when my knee was bad and it was tough , ’ said the 38 - year - old			1
‘ but with this injury i did n’t want to do anything			0
i could n’t get out of bed , move around house or anything			0
it made me appreciate how i was able to play for so long such a high level			0
with no acl i could still play			0
i could n’t enjoy my life			0
’ ‘ if i was still feeling like that then i could n’t play again			0
people who have had my surgery say the same thing : it changes your whole life			0
i do n’t have pain all the way down my leg now			0
but i knew i could come back			0
it was just a matter of time before i could play at the elite level			0
’ @entity2 has had to battle through more than just injury since he broke down in tears on @entity9 ’s 18th green six years ago			1
infamous issues in his private life have changed forever the way he will be perceived by the world			0
but @entity2 revealed that his previous visit to @entity9 was one of just a few times in his entire career where he has ‘ felt at peace ’ on the course			1
the other occasions were his record - breaking victories at @entity136 in 1997 and @entity137 in 2000 , two of the most destructive performances in the game ’s history			1
‘ it just happens , ’ he said			0
‘ maybe because i was in control of my game			0
the times i ’ve had that feeling i ’ve played really well			1
on the sunday i felt my dad was with me			0
it felt like he was my 15th club			0
i felt that peace out there			0
’ @entity153 aims to roar once more			0

@entity2 says only first place would be acceptable at @entity9
38 - year - old practices at @entity9 on tuesday ahead of @entity5
@entity42 has won the tournament three times , the last in 2006
