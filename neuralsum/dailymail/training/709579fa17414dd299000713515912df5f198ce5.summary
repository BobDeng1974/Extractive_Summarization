by @entity0 the morning after @entity2 ’s conference speech , @entity3 and his speechwriting team gathered at @entity5			1
the prime minister was in bullish mood			0
unlike several of his @entity9 colleagues , he was n’t overly concerned by @entity2 ’s raid on ‘ @entity13 ’ @entity12 territory			1
he joked : ‘ it ’s impressive to give a speech for 70 minutes without notes ; it ’s even more impressive to give a speech for 70 minutes without notes and not say anything			1
’ @entity3 ’s crack is typical of his new attitude			1
the prime minister has finally heeded the pleas of many of his closest allies and made himself and his @entity28 operation more political			0
@entity12 chairman @entity29 and @entity31 mayor @entity30 new @entity12 chairman @entity29 , unlike his predecessor @entity32 , attends the two key no 10 meetings of the day at 8.30am and 4pm			1
this ensures the party - political perspective is heard before decisions are taken			2
this more political approach will be evident in @entity3 ’s conference speech on wednesday			1
he ’ll argue his opponents do n’t understand how to make @entity42 economically competitive			0
he ’ll also try to show voters who want to get on that he understands that aspiration is the spur to success			0
@entity3 ’s party is increasingly focused on a strategy for winning a majority in 2015			1
the initial findings were presented to @entity12 cabinet ministers last month and to key aides at the party ’s campaign headquarters last week			1
outright victory has been made far harder by the @entity56 ’ refusal to back @entity12 efforts to reduce @entity60 bias in the electoral system			1
but those working on the strategy – the prime minister ’s political secretary @entity62 , his director of strategy @entity64 and @entity29 – believe that there are reasons for optimism			2
first , they think the @entity73 phenomenon of ‘ shy @entity74 ’ – people not being prepared to say they are voting for the party – has returned			1
they calculate that the party ’s true level of support could be five points or more above what headline figures suggest			0
second , they are confident that incumbency gives them an advantage			0
their analysis of the last @entity91 result shows sitting mps tended to be insulated against the national swing			0
third , they think they can be more targeted			0
in 2010 , the @entity74 were trying to take 160 seats			1
this time , they are looking at just 40			0
i ’m told the list will include more than ten @entity56 seats			0
the economy remains the key to victory in 2015 , however			2
in his speech tomorrow , @entity102 will set out tax breaks designed to boost growth			2
however , on @entity106 little will be said			0
one insider ascribes this to the influence of cabinet secretary @entity110			0
‘ you ca n’t talk about @entity106 in no 10 without @entity110 jumping down your throat , ’ i ’m told			0
@entity3 will have to say more soon			1
for his party wants two things from him : an understanding of how he intends to win next time and a clear lead on @entity106			0
providing these will be the best way to unite @entity74 around him			1
wordsmith : speechwriter @entity123 @entity3 ’s conference speech is the first big challenge for his new chief speechwriter , @entity123			1
@entity123 , who took on the job last month following the move of her predecessor @entity129 to the @entity130 , drafted the speech pretty much single - handedly			1
@entity123 , who is in her early 30s , has risen quickly though the @entity12 ranks			1
she previously worked for mp @entity133 and @entity30			0
at the start of her career , she supplemented her salary by driving an ice - cream van			0
she ’s been writing for @entity3 since 2008			1
after the election , she followed him into @entity139 , where she is respected for her ability to capture the prime minister ’s voice , knowing how he would choose to say something			0
@entity30 might be going to @entity12 conference for only 24 hours but , to the concern of many in @entity28 , he ’s still set to be the centre of attention			1
one no 10 aide says , only half - jokingly : ‘ at least we know where the trouble will come from			0
’ there ’s also anger at one of @entity30 ’s people claiming he turned down five invitations to @entity5 before accepting one last weekend			0
@entity3 is , strikingly , doing a series of tv interviews on tuesday , both the day of the @entity31 mayor ’s speech and the prime minister ’s birthday			1
i suspect the present he really wants is for @entity30 to behave			0
@entity2 and his team are planning a ¿ @entity13 ¿ trip across @entity42 designed to ram home the message of his conference address first there was the speech , then there was the tour			1
@entity2 and his team are planning a ‘ @entity13 ’ trip across @entity42 designed to ram home the message of his conference address			1
i understand the @entity178 leader is keen to show he is prepared to go to places where his party has long been absent , to show he ’s serious in his intent to represent the whole country			1
one stop will be in a solidly @entity12 seat hit by rapidly rising rail fares			2
@entity2 also wants to visit a constituency particularly affected by immigration			2
he knows that the last @entity191 ’s failure on this issue has hurt the party badly			0
i ’m informed that he wants to set out a comprehensive new policy , including restrictions on low - skilled migration from within the @entity197			0
this would pose a particular challenge to the @entity74 as @entity197 workers are not included in the government ’s immigration cap			2
another part of the ‘ @entity13 ’ message is the fight for the union			2
those close to the @entity178 leader are urging him to take the battle to the @entity209 first minister @entity208 ’s backyard and head to @entity212 to make his case that @entity209 should remain part of the @entity42			1
yet @entity2 needs more policy to accompany his new rhetoric			2
i understand there will be a @entity9 away - day later this month to thrash out proposals			0
he is still a long way from persuading the public that @entity178 would handle the nation ’s finances competently			2
but the success of this conference has given him a political opening			0
prime minister @entity2 is now a possibility that needs to be taken seriously .			2

@entity3 *unperturbed* by @entity2 **'s** ' @entity13 ' speech
says he is more impressed that @entity2 performed without notes for 70 minutes
@entity12 leader has *rallied* his top speech - writing troops to prepare a strategy focused clearly on politics and the economy to win the election - elements the @entity74 say are lacking from the @entity178 **'s** campaign
