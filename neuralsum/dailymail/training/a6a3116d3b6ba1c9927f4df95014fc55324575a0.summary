by @entity0 @entity2 - up viewers have told the @entity3 to stop moving events from channel to channel , saying it is wearing them out trying to keep up			1
some sports such as the cycling road races and gymnastics have been switched from @entity10 to other channels , such as @entity12 , or viewers have been redirected to one of the corporation ’s 24 dedicated @entity16 channels			1
critics claim that once the broadcaster starts showing a sport on a channel , it should stick with it			1
switch - over : gymnastics has been one of several events where viewers have been asked to change channel to continue watching mid-way through the excitement others admitted they had not realised the sport they had been watching had been switched and they ended up missing large chunks of it			0
the @entity3 is operating 24 dedicated channels showing all the action from every event on satellite and cable			1
but many viewers access the coverage through the two main channels – @entity10 and @entity12 – which have been changing events in the middle of the coverage			0
one viewer wrote on the @entity3 ’s message - board : ‘ i ’m trying to watch the bike race here ! it started on @entity10 , moved to @entity3 and now is moved to the @entity49 ! ‘ stop doing that ! i feel like i ’m participating in the @entity16 , chasing after the tv channel			2
’ another said : ‘ this is becoming a nasty habit with the @entity3 and i absolutely hate it ! it ’s like watching a tv with your kid in charge of the remote			2
’ others took to @entity61 to complain			0
one sports fan tweeted : ‘ ughhh , was streaming the gymnastics on @entity10 and it switched to @entity12 and the stream i have for that does n’t work			0
’ another added : ‘ did n’t realise gymnastics switched to @entity12 , been watching horse riding for about 20 minutes			0
’ a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ every event is live and uninterrupted on the @entity3 ’s 24 @entity16 channels , which have proved enormously popular and are being watched by millions			1
‘ on @entity10 and @entity12 , we go to the best of the action , which occasionally means we will switch events between channels			2
‘ but this is the first time people can use the red button to find full live coverage of anything they choose and that can also be recorded			0

critics claim once broadcaster starts showing event , it should stay on same channel
