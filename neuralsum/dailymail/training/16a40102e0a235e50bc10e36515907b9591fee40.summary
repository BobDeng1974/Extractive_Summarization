by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 10:20 est , 13 october 2013 the parents of a toddler with cerebral palsy have told how they face a desperate battle to raise tens of thousands of pounds to pay for him to have life - changing surgery			1
@entity7 , two , needs pioneering surgery to enable him to walk , but the operation is not funded by the @entity10			1
his parents , @entity12 , 38 , and @entity13 , 36 , must now raise £ 60,000 to pay for him to have the operation at either @entity15 , @entity16 in @entity17 , or @entity18			2
@entity7 , two , has spastic diplegic cerebral palsy which means he will not be able to walk without a frame unless he has pioneering surgery which is not available on the @entity10 without the surgery , the best they can hope for @entity7 is that he will be able to walk with the help of a frame			1
‘ the surgery would give @entity7 the chance for a normal life – i ca n’t put into words how much it would mean for him , ’ mrs @entity27 , from @entity28 in @entity29 , told @entity30			1
@entity7 was born almost 12 weeks early in january 2011 weighing just 2lbs 12oz			1
he spent seven weeks in hospital during which time he spent weeks in intensive care and he developed the hospital superbug @entity37			1
mrs @entity27 said : ‘ at the time it was the scariest experience			0
it was described to us by those at the hospital as the biggest rollercoaster you will ever ride , but we got through it			2
‘ we spent hours staring at monitors willing him to get better			2
’ @entity7 ( pictured with his mother , @entity12 ) needs @entity51 surgery which , until recently , was only available in the @entity52 @entity7 has recently learnt to stand up with his walking frame but is yet to learn how to walk with it			1
without surgery his parents fear he will never be able to play with the other children at school or to ride a bike @entity7 , who has an older sister , @entity60 , four , was eventually allowed to leave hospital march but he suffered severe reflux meaning he was unsettled and was sick about every hour and a half			1
he grew out of the reflux but as autumn arrived , he began to develop regular bouts of bronchiolitis – a lower respiratory tract infection			0
by november 2011 , @entity7 ’s parents , who both work for @entity70 as on board managers , started to realise something was not right			1
mrs @entity27 said : ‘ we started to realise that @entity7 was n’t really doing anything			1
@entity7 was born almost 12 weeks early in january 2011			1
when he was born , he weighed just 2lbs 12oz @entity7 spent seven weeks in hospital during which time he spent weeks in intensive care and he developed the hospital superbug @entity37 ‘ he was such a happy little man but all he could do was lie on the floor on his back			1
‘ he could n’t roll or sit up like other children and hated spending time on his front - he just screamed			1
‘ we were told by so many people it was just developmental delay and he was just a lazy boy			0
‘ after months of pushing from us we finally got him to see a physio , and she started to tell us how concerned she was about muscle tone but it really meant nothing to us			2
’ @entity7 ( pictured with his mother ) was released from hospital when he was seven - weeks - old but just months later his parents realised he was not developing normally as he had not learnt to roll over or sit up @entity7 was eventually diagnosed when a physiotherapist expressed concern about his muscle tone and his parents took him to see a different consultant then , in april 2012 , @entity7 saw a new consultant who finally diagnosed him with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy and his parents were told he might never walk			1
mrs @entity27 said : ‘ we knew something was n’t quite right but never in our wildest dreams , or should i say nightmares , did we expect to hear that			0
‘ you go through so many feelings after being told something like that but after a while you pick yourselves up and get on with life again			0
’ since his diagnosis , @entity7 has been having regular physiotherapy and , as a result , has now leant to roll over , sit up on his own , and crawl			1
mrs @entity27 said : ' we knew something was n't quite right but never in our wildest dreams , or should i say nightmares , did we expect to hear that ' mrs @entity27 said : ' life can be so frustrating for him , all he wants to do is join in with other children , scoot , play on a bike and kick a ball			0
this operation will give him the chance to do this			0
' @entity7 is pictured with his sister , @entity60 , four however , to be able to walk without a frame , he needs @entity51 surgery			1
this is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			0
it involves opening the lower vertebrae to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
during the procedure , electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			2
@entity51 is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			2
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			2
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			2
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs			2
following the surgery , months of intensive physiotherapy is required to help the child walk			1
the surgery and subsequent physiotherapy cost up to £ 60,000			2
until recently , the operation was only available in the @entity52 and @entity177 and mrs @entity27 are aware that , even now , @entity7 may need to travel to @entity52 to have the surgery			1
funding is not routinely offered by the @entity10			0
dr @entity180 , medical director for the @entity181 at @entity182 said : ' we sympathise with patients and families who feel they may benefit from this treatment , however , @entity51 ( @entity51 ) is not routinely funded by the @entity10 as the current evidence base does not yet demonstrate sufficient clinical and cost effectiveness for its routine use			2
' it has been identified by clinicians and patient representatives as showing significant " promise " as a potential treatment option for the future and forms part of the commissioning through evaluation programme			0
' @entity201 programme , which was originally developed with clinicians treating heart conditions , will enable @entity51 , and other appropriate services and / or treatments , to be funded within defined parameters , in a small number of participating centres , and within an explicit evaluation programme			1
' mrs @entity27 said : ‘ life can be so frustrating for him , all he wants to do is join in with other children , scoot , play on a bike and kick a ball			0
this operation will give him the chance to do this			0
’ she told @entity30 : ‘ after the surgery he would have some sort of normal life			0
he could play with the other children – it would be completely different			0
‘ at the moment he can only crawl – this operation will remove so many restrictions in his life			0
‘ it will give him less pain in the future and will mean he faces less frustration			0
it will be absolutely massive for him			0
‘ now , the idea of him being able to walk , and even maybe run a little bit , is inconceivable			0
’ mr and mrs @entity27 are raising money for @entity7 ’s treatment through the charity tree of @entity238 which helps families raise money for medicines , surgery and treatment which are not available on the @entity10			1
any money that is left over after @entity7 has had his surgery will go to help other sick children			1
the couple are planning a golf day and also a ball to raise money for the surgery which they hope @entity7 will be able to have at the beginning of next summer			1
@entity7 ’s four - year - old sister , @entity60 , is running the 1.5km @entity256 to help with the fundraising			1
