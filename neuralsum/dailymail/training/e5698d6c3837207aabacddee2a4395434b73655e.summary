' including the main food groups - protein , carbohydrate and fruit and veg at each meal will ensure we get a variety of the essential nutrients to prevent deficiencies			0
' if we do n't have carbs at each meal we can become low in energy			2
we do n't promote the use of supplements , unless prescribed by a health care professional , as we should get all the nutrients we require from our diet			2
our bodies use nutrients derived by food more effectively			0
' i would also promote physical activity as a part of a healthy lifestyle and weight loss			0
the price is certainly enough to put people off - just stick to a healthy balanced diet , portion control and exercise for long tern success			2
