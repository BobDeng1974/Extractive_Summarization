@entity1 defender @entity0 is unsurprised to see manager @entity2 linked with the @entity4 job			1
@entity5 has already been touted as a possible replacement for @entity7 despite the latter still being in a job at @entity10			1
defeat at home to @entity1 on saturday in front of what is expected to be a hostile @entity15 crowd might weaken @entity7 's grasp still further , while also strengthening @entity2 's hand			1
@entity1 defender @entity0 ( left ) vies with @entity21 's @entity20 striker @entity19 @entity2 , manager of @entity1 , has been linked with a possible job at @entity4 @entity7 is under increasing pressure at @entity4 following a poor start to the season for his part , the former @entity28 boss has shown no interest in the post he turned down in 2004 and has repeatedly labelled any such speculation ' disrespectful ' to both @entity1 and @entity7			1
but @entity0 sees it as a mark of his success at the @entity36 , where @entity2 has overseen an unlikely promotion , an even unlikelier run to the @entity40 final and a brief dalliance with the @entity42 in two whirlwind years			1
' it 's no surprise to me or anyone around here ( to see speculation about @entity2 )			1
the manager has been fantastic ever since he walked in the front door , ' said @entity0			2
' he 's been a breath of fresh air through the club			2
there 's only four or five of us left from before he arrived			0
it 's been a great journey and he 's now bringing in Â£ 10million centre forwards and @entity60 internationals			0
that shows what a great job he 's done			0
' it 's no surprise to me that other teams will be interested in his services			0
' @entity2 's @entity28 history , and his own taunts at the hand of @entity4 fans down the years , make a move to tyneside a tricky sell , but @entity0 also thinks the spirit he has fostered in @entity76 would be hard to let go			1
' in football anything can happen , but the manager is a fantastic guy and a great manager and whatever happened it 's been a pleasure playing for him , ' @entity0 added			2
some supporters have given up on watching their team and decided to not renew cheap season tickets @entity4 owner @entity85 ( centre ) is being encouraged by fans to wield the axe and sack @entity7 ' there 's a respect and a bond there			1
if you look at all the great teams of the past like @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , although i 'm not comparing us to them , there 's a bond between the staff and the players that makes you successful			0
' that 's what we 've got here			0
' why would i want to lose one of , if not the , most important part of something that 's been so successful ? ' @entity0 also attempted to downplay with humour the reunion between @entity7 and @entity113			1
@entity7 was banned for seven matches last season for headbutting the @entity117 midfielder on the touchline			2
i think ( @entity113 ) is going to take his boxing gloves up there just in case ! , ' said a joking @entity0			2
' it was an unfortunate incident and goes to show how much people care			0
it got out of hand			0
' but it 's not about the sideshows			0
the important thing is going up there to win the game			0
' @entity4 protest group ' @entity131 ' have parodied owner @entity85 's @entity133 logo @entity4 fans hold up a banner with the words ' @entity7 is a muppet ' during the defeat at @entity140			1
