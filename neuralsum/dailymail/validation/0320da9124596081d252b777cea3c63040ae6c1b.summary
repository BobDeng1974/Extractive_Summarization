the @entity0 sent a stern message on monday to @entity3 prime minister @entity2 , with president @entity5 's chief of staff declaring that @entity6 ' must end ' a 47 - year policy of holding contested territory that @entity9 claim as their own			1
' an occupation that has lasted for almost than 50 years must end , ' @entity10 told an annual convention of ' @entity13 , ' a left - wing jewish advocacy group , in @entity15 @entity5 himself did not attend , but sent @entity10 to read a speech in his stead while he attended a science fair for schoolchildren at the @entity0 and gave brief remarks to an investment summit			1
' an occupation that has lasted for almost 50 years must end , ' said @entity10 , his eyes often glued to his paper			0
' and the @entity9 people must have the right to live in and govern themselves in their own sovereign state			0
' ' @entity9 children deserve the same right to be free in their own land as @entity3 children in their land , ' he declared later to applause			2
had the president delivered the message himself , comparisons would have instantly been made to the @entity47 , @entity13 's conservative counterpart , which @entity5 snubbed during the week when @entity2 was in the @entity55 to deliver a speech to @entity62			1
but @entity5 managed to be elsewhere , leaving @entity10 to walk on stage to the sound of @entity65 's ' @entity66 ' – whose fourth stanza opens with , ' the @entity69 is here / the happy ones are near			2
' he immediately grabbed the liberal crowd 's attention with news that the president ' has appointed more women , minorities , and openly gay judges ' than any other @entity78 occupant			0
but it was mention of a ' two - state solution ' to the decades - old @entity83 - @entity3 conflict that brought the disproportionately young crowd , seeded wth raucous college students , to its feet			1
' president @entity5 asked me to convey his deep appreciation to all of you for your partnership and your work on behalf of the @entity55 - @entity3 relationship , ' @entity10 said near the beginning of his speech			1
' especially building support for our efforts to advance a two - state solution			1
' @entity2 , now poised for another four years as prime ministrer , pledged before last week 's @entity3 elections that with his @entity102 in power , he would refuse to allow the @entity104 to graduate to full statehood			1
he qualified that promise after his come - from - behind victory on @entity108 , saying conditions on the ground would have to change before he would consider approving a @entity9 state			1
the @entity104 , he said , would have to break with @entity112 and other terror groups , and stop firing rockets into @entity3			0
the @entity0 focused monday on @entity2 's pre-election vow , saying that ' we can not simply pretend that these comments were never made			0
' the @entity5 administration , like others before it , supports the idea of @entity3 and @entity9 states coexisting on adjacent lands			2
but unlike past presidents , @entity5 's testy relationship with his @entity3 counterpart has brought him to the verge of taking action			2
busy , busy , busy : president @entity5 sent his chief of staff to deliver an ultimatum to @entity3 while he presided over a science fair in the @entity134 at the @entity0 @entity135 : @entity138 , led by college students on @entity137 , erupted into applause at the mention of a two - state solution @entity142 : @entity104 leader @entity143 ( right ) argues – and @entity13 agrees – that @entity3 is encroaching on his people 's lands with settlements ( left ) built by @entity2 's government the @entity55 has for decades used its permanent - member veto on the @entity151 @entity150 to block resolutions demanding @entity9 statehood			1
that , @entity0 officials signaled las tweek , could soon change			0
@entity156 followed his saber - rattling in @entity2 's direction with a calmer assurance that ' no matter who leads @entity3 , @entity55 ’s commitment to @entity3 national security will never waver			1
' that was meant to be a salve for @entity39 who fear a nuclear - armed @entity51 less than 1,000 miles away , an outcome the @entity0 says it 's trying to avoid with secret negotiations conducted in @entity167			0
the @entity55 , @entity10 said , ' will do everything in our power to prevent @entity51 from obtaining a nuclear weapon			0
' ' the deal we are pursuing is both realistic and achievable , ' he said of the bilateral talks , which @entity2 and congressional @entity175 in @entity15 have criticized as a tool of appeasement that 's too soft on @entity178			2
' a scenario where @entity51 forgoes domestic enrichment capacity for all time would surely be ideal , but it ’s not grounded in reality , ' @entity10 declared			0
' not even our closest partners support denying @entity51 the ability to pursue peaceful nuclear energy forever , and @entity51 already knows how to enrich uranium			0
' ' we ca n’t turn back the clock on that , ' he said .			0

president @entity5 did **n't** *personally* address the annual meeting of ' @entity13 , ' @entity15 's most *influential* left - wing @entity39 group
he sent chief of staff instead to read a speech to *thousands* of activists while he attended a science fair and an investment summit
@entity10 insisted the @entity55 will remain *friendly* to @entity3
but he *slammed* @entity2 for saying before last week 's election that there would **n't** be a @entity9 state while he was prime minister
*hundreds* of college students in the *audience* *cheered* at @entity10 's mention of a ' two - state solution ' to the @entity83 - @entity3 conflict
