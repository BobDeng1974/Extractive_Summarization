@entity0 failed to score for the first time this season after being held to a goalless draw against @entity4 , but remain top of the @entity6			1
@entity0 had been on fire this season with 20 goals in nine games – including five against @entity12 midweek – but @entity4 finally put an end to their goal - scoring run			1
in the end the league leaders were fortunate to come away with a point from this feisty encounter			0
@entity4 's @entity19 ( left ) vies for the ball with @entity0 's @entity21 @entity4 : @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 ( @entity27 6 ' ) , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity19 , @entity30 , @entity31 ( @entity32 67 ' ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 65 ' ) subs ( not used ) : @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 booked : @entity24 , @entity28 @entity0 : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 44 ' ) , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 75 ' ) , @entity51 , @entity52 subs ( not used ) : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 booked : @entity46 , @entity42 , @entity40 referee : @entity60 attendance : 12.038 @entity4 's @entity29 shot wide from just six yards out and @entity33 saw a first - time shot , which he reached at a stretch , saved by @entity0 goalkeeper @entity40 's out - stretched leg from point - blank range			1
the closest the away side came to scoring was when @entity67 swung in a cross from the left on 31 minutes which caught out @entity22 in @entity4 's goal and was creeping in under the bar , only for the keeper to claw the ball out			2
hot - shot @entity0 forward @entity75 could 've won it late on , too , but his header from close range lacked power and @entity22 was able to just keep the ball from crossing the line			2
it took until the 51st minute for the first booking to arrive , which was a miracle considering the two sides had mainly been kicking lumps out each other until that point			0
another followed two minutes later , then another two more after that			0
@entity89 , @entity42 and @entity90 all went into the book			0
the game finished with five bookings in total , but not a single goal			0
@entity0 still remain unbeaten this season , with three draws and six wins in all competitions , as they set the early @entity6 pace			2
@entity0 midfielder @entity89 tries to win possession off @entity4 's @entity90 forest boss @entity101 watches on as his side fail to score for the first time this season			1

@entity0 fail to score for the first time this season
but they remain top of the @entity6 after 0 - 0 at @entity4
@entity109 's side *unfortunate* not to come away with win
