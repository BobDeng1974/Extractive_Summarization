' i really think they are the perfect lashes - everyone i have given them has been complimented whenever i wear them			2
' sharing her top tips for applying falsies , the expert said : ' trim the outside , not the inside of the lashes to suit your eyes size , put the glue on and wait a few seconds until it gets tacky and put them on with tweezers to ensure they are on securely			2
