these amazing shots capture the moment a @entity3 bat glides silently in pursuit of prey with delicate wings outstretched and its small mouth gaping open			1
the detailed shots were captured by wildlife photographer @entity9 , in @entity10 near @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
it shows the exact moment two bats - a speedy pipistrelle and a small brown bat - locate a flighty moth over an expanse of desert scrub and woodland			1
prey : this small bat echo has located a flighty moth as it gets ready to strike in pursuit of its prey each image was taken in the late hours between 11pm and 2am by @entity9 , 49 , who patiently waits for the creatures to appear - ready to snap them with lasers which trigger a high - speed shutter			1
he spots when a long - eared myotis bat skims the surface of a man - made guzzler , eager to scoop a mouthful of water in the muggy heat of the night			2
mr @entity9 , from @entity39 , @entity12 , said : ' this is an enormous technical challenge			1
bats prefer to fly in complete darkness and they are incredibly quick			0
' i 'll watch the figures being fed onto a laptop but sometimes the bats surprise me by flying back and forth through the laser trigger like it 's a fun trick they can do			2
' despite capturing them in pursuit of prey , the photographer has never actually seen the bats catch an insect - although he has heard it with a bat detector			1
prey : this @entity3 bat sees its prey as it glides over an expanse of desert scrub and woodland in @entity10 and near @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 fresh water : a long - eared myotis bat skims the surface of a man - made guzzler , eager to scoop a mouthful of water in the muggy heat of the night he said : ' the detector allows you to hear the ultrasonic calls of a bat and when they are closing in on prey the calls become extremely rapid and turn into a buzz			1
' the bats do occasionally make a flapping noise but they 're otherwise silent to human ears			0
of course , they are actually echo - locating like crazy in the ultrasonic range			2
' the nocturnal creatures eat anything from beetles and centipedes to small fish and even frogs			2
due to their secretive nature , humans rarely see bats up close - so a brush with the beasts is valued by mr @entity9			1
he said : ' i 've had curious bats land on my head and brush past me with their wings			0
i try to stay out of their way , but i 'm incredibly close			0
' i think bats represent all the things in nature that we do n't see directly			0
. they are magnificent little animals but almost nobody gets to see them in action up close			0
' and yet they live just outside our doors and under our very noses			0
' there are thousands of spectacles of nature that we ca n't observe because we lack the proper ability to perceive			0
bats are just the tip of the iceberg			0
' i think these photos are just a brief look into the life of a very secretive animal			0
