by @entity0 published : 03:14 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 04:18 est , 29 august 2012 smuggled alcohol costs the taxman more than £ 1billion a year - but no more than six criminals are prosecuted every year , @entity1 said last night			1
@entity6 officials were lambasted last night for its lax enforcement regime which means just 20 people have been convicted for dodging alcohol tax over four years			1
the failure by @entity12 to take effective action against criminal gangs means the @entity15 loses out to the tune of £ 1.2billion a year			1
a raid on a warehouse in @entity19 , @entity20 , in 2010 , uncovered 33,000 litres of pure alcohol in containers and bottles , pictured			1
those behidn the operation paid no excise duty or vat mps on the powerful @entity29 said the department did not have good enough information about how effective it was at tackling the problem and failed to make the best use of intelligence and technology to detect and prevent evasion			0
and the criticised the @entity12 for having no idea about the extent of the tax gap for wine - making it impossible to target enforcement action against wine			1
mps said they had been told criminals often export duty unpaid alcohol then redirect it back to the @entity46 to sell			2
the report revealed that between 2006/07 and 2009/10 , the highest number of successful prosecutions in any one year was six , and the highest number of defendants was 16			2
this illegal distillery discovered in @entity19 in 2010 , costi the taxman £ 10 million in lost revenue it concluded that the @entity12 does not take enough account of the deterrent effect of successful prosecutions when considering the cost and benefits of pursuing perpetrators through the courts			1
@entity62 , an mp on the committee , said : ' @entity12 's drive to tackle alcohol duty evasion is being seriously hampered by a lack of information			2
mp @entity62 , who sits on the @entity29 , criticised @entity12 for its lack of information regarding alcohol duty evasion ' alcohol fraud is big business			2
the department estimates that the gap between taxes due on alcohol and the amount actually collected might be as large as £ 1.2billion			1
' the department does not , however , have enough reliable information on the returns from tackling different types of alcohol duty evasion			2
' it can not say , therefore , whether a more effective targeting of its resources might not secure a better return on its investment			0
' it is unacceptable that the department has still to produce an estimate of the tax gap for wine , despite a commitment to this committee 's predecessors to do so			0
' the absence of information on the scale and nature of wine duty fraud undermines the basis on which the department directs its resources to tackling the problem			0
' he added : ' since the criminal gangs who perpetrate major alcohol duty fraud operate across national boundaries , the department needs to strengthen its intelligence by developing better links with the industry , the @entity116 and other @entity115 member states			0
' the department seems to be reluctant to prosecute offenders			0
over a recent four year period , there were successful prosecutions in no more than six cases a year			0
criminals who dodge alcohol tax cost the taxman £ 1.2billion a year			1
file picture ' this sends the wrong message to perpetrators and the wider public about the department 's commitment to reducing alcohol duty evasion			0
' it should give more weight to the deterrent impact of pursuing perpetrators through the courts			0
