by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 06:23 est , 18 june 2012 it was an age of @entity3 optimism and @entity4 was the inspiring centrepiece of a nation thought to have a boundless potential for future creativity and economic growth			2
so it is perhaps not surprising that the mayor had such high hopes for his city when he predicted in 1962 what it would be like today			1
among his forecasts for 2012 , @entity16 believed @entity4 would be driving rocket - powered cars and speed through the metropolis on @entity20			1
hopeful forecast : a copy of @entity25 article in 1962 in which the then mayor , @entity21 , optimistically predicting what the city would be like for its people in 2012 and he hoped the era would see an end to the social and racial divisions that had allowed many districts to be exclusively populated by one class or ethnic group			1
writing in @entity25 , mr @entity21 , who served as mayor between 1954 and 1965 , also predicted that @entity4 could all enjoy free access to university			1
mayor @entity21 , @entity25 1962 instead , all neighbourhoods would be completely mixed and the majority of the city ’s residents owned their own comfortable and affordable homes			1
of course , the reality has turned out to be somewhat different			0
those few @entity4 who drive still expect to spend hours stuck in gridlock and the traditional subway trains remain the main form of mass transit			0
neighbourhoods have become more racially mixed , especially in @entity51 , but there are still some enclaves with only minimal diversity			0
and , rather than increasing affordability , the city has become one where only the wealthiest have enough money to buy an apartment in its core borough			0
only 30 per cent of homes in @entity4 are owned by their occupiers as prices have soared well above inflation			1
vision of modernity : mr @entity21 thought people may travel in vertically - soaring helicopters to their homes and offices in @entity4 's even taller skyscrapers , right , that would incorporate more air and green space inside as for free tuition , the one institution that offered free courses – @entity79 – was forced to scrap this policy in 1975 due to fiscal crisis at @entity82			1
in real terms , the cost of higher education has more than doubled since mr @entity21 , a @entity86 , served as mayor			1
yet many of his words also contain more than a grain of truth of the modern reality and some predictions are surprisingly prescient			0
‘ starting from this point , we may safely say that in 2012 @entity4 will be a city where all races and nations meet and mingle - a city of many cultures , each of which will be respected and prized , ' he wrote 29 years before his death in 1991			0
‘ as for slums , they will be just a memory of a rot that afflicted the city long ago			0
optimist : @entity16 served as @entity4 mayor between 1954 and 1965			2
he died in 1991 ‘ we may fervently hope that racial discrimination will be ply a legend , referred to as an illustrations of a past shame and injustice based on widespread public ignorance and prejudice			1
there will be a series of cultural enclaves , but no racial , national , or even economic segregation			2
‘ there will still be a @entity121 , a @entity122 , a @entity123 , a @entity124 , a @entity125 , a @entity126 , a @entity127 - but they will be open neighbourhoods of people who will live there and not because there is no place else for them to live			2
’ this prediction , although wildly optimistic , was at least correct to assume racially segregation in these neighbourhoods would no longer be quite so racially segregated			0
the @entity126 has perhaps changed the most – from a packed ghetto for @entity140 and eastern @entity139 families to a bohemian centre favoured by young professionals			0
and he was not wrong when he wrote that ‘ the charm and character of neighbourhoods will be foremost among the values to be preserved			0
‘ the emphasis will be on “ difference ” rather than conformity			0
’ although economic division remains rife and nowhere better illustrates this than the housing market , where many residents who characterised neighbourhoods have been priced out			1
in 1962 , mr @entity21 predicted : ‘ many if not most apartments will be owned by the people living in them			1
‘ rental housing will be generally for the very young , for newcomers and for transients			0
‘ to a greater and greater extent , housing will be built to promote the values of individual , family and community life rather than laid out with the sole object of renting or selling to a particular economic group or class			0
’ the former mayor also believed that free facilities such as schools and museums would ‘ have so multiplied that the most concentrated community in the world may also be the most cultured , the most creative , and the most varied - a free and open community of free minds and free spirits			1
reflection : a futuristic image made by @entity180 in the 1960s may well serve what mr @entity21 had in mind ‘ all parts of the city ’s great great free - tuition university , including a full range of graduate and professional schools , will have come of age			1
’ yet the vast majority of museums now charge entrance fees in excess of $ 10 and without a scholarship , few students can hope to get a university degree without also being saddled with thousands of dollars worth of debt			2
mr @entity21 also fervently believed @entity4 ’s skyline would continue to soar			1
‘ within this great complex of people and their enterprises , apartment and office buildings will rise even higher than they do today , but they will not occupy the ground space			2
‘ there will be more sunlight , grass and greenery			0
skyscrapers and towers will be interlaced with light and air – as vital to the building plan as stone glass and steel			1
‘ small parks and squares will balance skyscrapers			1
’ yet , few new skyscrapers have been built and – due to the tragic destruction of the @entity222 by terrorists – its tallest tower remains the 1,250ft - high @entity225 , which was completed in 1931			2
one area in which he was reasonably perceptive was the city ’s population , which he predicted would remain around the eight million mark			2
however , he suggested that the number of people living in the tri-state metropolitan area could rise to up to 50million			2
same buildings , much higher rent : mr @entity21 's prediction that former slums like those in the @entity126 , above , would no longer exist were partly realised			1
the area is no longer an ethnic ghetto , although few poorer families can afford to live in the ' bohemian ' district which has become popular with young professionals instead around 18million reside in the conurbation which spreads into the states of @entity249 and @entity250 as well as @entity4			0
yet mr @entity21 was staggeringly wrong when he predicted the state of today ’s transportation			1
‘ by 2012 , @entity4 will have at least partially resolved the earlier paradox whereby man , the earthbound creature , had learned to fly through the air at a speed faster than sound but was unable to move through the city at a pace faster than a snail ’s			2
‘ the partial solution will have come from the expanded use of modernised mass transportation and the diversion of the major flow of vehicular traffic into expressways and tunnels			0
‘ @entity270 may well be travelling from suburb to city , from river to river , and from one borough to another , by rocket - powered vehicles and monorails , or by huge vertical rising helicopters			0
’ at the very least , such skewed predictions should at least give us hope that some some of today ’s more dire forecasts are never realised			0
but whether we finally get to drive rocket - powered cars or afford that penthouse in @entity51 remains to be seen .			0

as well as *super-fast* transport , mayor @entity21 believed era would see end to racial and social division
predicted most people would own their homes and all residents would get free university education
believed skyscrapers would soar ever upward with public parks in the air
