dehydration is defined as a shortage of water in the body ¿ but the @entity4 decided the statement could not be allowed it may not come as a surprise to many but bottled water can keep you cool and healthy			2
but it was only today that @entity12 authorities made the ruling , which should allow companies to make such claims on their products			2
it follows a bizarre ruling by the @entity19 last week that drinking water does not ease dehydration			2
the controversial decision - after three years of discussion - led to much head - scratching at advertising companies			2
now the @entity4 have added to the general confusion by approving two claims that bottled water can help keep you both cool and healthy			2
the @entity4 said there was enough evidence to prove water can regulate the body 's temperature and help it carry out normal ' physical and cognitive functions			0
' it is expected that the @entity19 will allow companies to make both claims on packaging in the future			0
what they can not do is say that it is prevents dehydration - and they face a possible two year jail sentence if they do so			0
this decision results from an attempt by two @entity49 academics to test @entity51 advertising rules which set down when companies can claim their products reduce the risk of disease			0
the academics asked for a ruling on a convoluted statement which , in short , claimed that water could reduce dehydration			0
dehydration is defined as a shortage of water in the body – but the @entity4 decided the statement could not be allowed			0
the ruling , announced after a conference of 21 @entity51 - appointed scientists in @entity68 and which means that bottled water companies can not claim their product stops people ’s bodies drying out , was given final approval last week by @entity19 president @entity74			0
in response @entity76 mep @entity75 , said : ‘ this is stupidity writ large			1
the euro is burning , the @entity51 is falling apart and yet here they are worrying about the obvious qualities of water			0
if ever there were an episode which demonstrates the folly of the great @entity12 project , then this is it			0
’ under @entity93 law , advertisers who make health claims that breach @entity51 law can be prosecuted and face two years in jail			1
the decision was being hailed as the daftest @entity97 edict since the @entity51 sent down laws on how bendy bananas should be			1
@entity101 mep @entity100 said : ‘ i had to read this four or five times before i believed it			1
careful consideration : @entity19 president @entity74 gave final approval to the 21 scientists ' ruling this week ‘ it is a perfect example of what @entity97 does best			1
spend three years , with 20 separate pieces of correspondence before summoning 21 professors to @entity68 , where they decide with great solemnity that drinking water can not be sold as a way to combat dehydration			0
’ he added : ‘ then they make this judgment law and make it clear that if anybody dares sell water claiming that it is effective against dehydration they could get into serious legal bother			1
‘ this makes the bendy banana law look positively sane			1
’ the statement on which the eminent @entity51 experts ruled claimed that ‘ regular consumption of significant amounts of water can reduce the risk of development of dehydration and of concomitant decrease of performance			1
’ however the @entity68 gathering ruled : ‘ the panel considers that the proposed claim does not comply with the requirements for a disease risk reduction claim			1
’ it declared that shortage of water in the body was just a symptom of dehydration			1
dr @entity149 and dr @entity150 of the @entity151 and @entity152 at @entity153 said they were unhappy but not surprised			0
‘ we fear there is something wrong in the state of @entity12 , ’ professor @entity149 said			1
he added that the academics had been trying to test the working of @entity51 food and advertising rules			0
‘ it was free of charge , there was no apparent red tape attached and it gave food business operators , whom we regularly advise , a chance to advertise their products in a new way , ’ he added			1
‘ we thought we should give it a try and see what would happen			1
‘ but over almost four years , it became clear that the procedure was anything but straightforward			2
any company depending on the claim would long have gone out of business			0
what is our reaction to the outcome ? let us put it this way : we are neither surprised nor delighted			0
’ he said : ‘ the @entity19 is wrong ; it should have authorised the claim			1
that should be more than clear to anyone who has consumed water in the past , and who has not ? ’			2

@entity101 mep @entity100 : ‘ i had to read this four or five times before i believed it . this makes the bendy banana law look positively sane ’
