having downed more than 20 alcopops and shots at an @entity51 revival club night , the woman collapsed and was so drunk she could barely speak and could not stand up			1

i could n’t think properly			0

he told @entity70 he had been blighted by sleep problems for more than 25 years and that he regularly had sex with his long - term partner while asleep			1
he said on the night in question he simply wanted to help the woman			1
‘ i just wanted to go to sleep			0
i did n’t know where i was when i woke up			0
i was all over the place , ’ he said , in tears			0
‘ all i wanted to do was help her			0
i did n’t want to hurt her			0
it is difficult to describe how i feel			0
’ @entity1 ’s partner , @entity80 , 38 , said he had undressed her and had sex with her before while sleeping			1

’ his sister , @entity86 , told the jury the condition runs in their family			1
she said : ‘ i have sleep sex			2
i discovered that when i was married			0
my husband told me about it			2
i ’ve no recollection of what i ’ve done or what i ’ve said			0

‘ this is on any view an extremely unusual set of circumstances			0
‘ @entity112 is real and for people who suffer from it , it is desperately real			0
’ @entity116 , prosecuting , said @entity1 lied about the incident and knew that what he was doing was wrong			1
the woman added : ‘ if it was sex that i wanted i would have gone out and found it and done it and not said a word to anybody , but i did n’t			2
’ @entity1 wept as the jury foreman read out the not guilty verdict , following three days of deliberation			1
later , he said : ‘ i am deeply sorry for all the heartache and hurt that has been caused by the unfortunate set of circumstances that were beyond my control			2
there have always been two victims in this case			0
