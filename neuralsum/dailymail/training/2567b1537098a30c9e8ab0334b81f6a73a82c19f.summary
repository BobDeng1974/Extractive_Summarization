researchers suggest that being close to others with similar personality traits goes back millions of years			1

they studied colonies of chimpanzees in two @entity32 zoos and firstly rated their personality traits			0
@entity36 was measured by physical proximity , for example how often individuals were within 6ft of another chimp			0
the frequency of grooming , in which the apes remove dirt and parasites from each other , was also crucial as it builds bonds			0

’ he added that teaming up with someone of similar character can help build trust , while friendships between daring chimps would help when trying to fight off predators .			1
