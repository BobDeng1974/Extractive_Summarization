an internet feed to his bedroom and a phone line to @entity5 ’s bench			1
suffice to say , @entity6 ’s day away from the touchline was not altogether that relaxing			2
his chest infection was deemed significant enough to keep him away from this fixture , but that self - imposed exile seems to have only applied to the body			1
the mind was firmly in south @entity13 , watching stuttering footage on his home computer and calling the shots to @entity17 via his phone			0
@entity5 ’s manager might just have ended up with a headache for his trouble			2
this was a game his side should have won , having led through a goal of some beauty from @entity27			1
goal : @entity63 74 @entity5 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity64 6 ; @entity65 7 , @entity66 6.5 , @entity67 6.5 ; @entity68 6.5 , @entity42 6.5 ( @entity69 82 ) , @entity41 6 , @entity43 6.5 , @entity70 6 ; @entity27 7.5 , @entity71 5.5 ( @entity72 71 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 goal : @entity27 43 booked : @entity69 referee : @entity81 6.5 @entity82 : @entity27 attendance : 20,745 @entity27 scored @entity5 's opener by latching on to a cross by @entity43 - click here for our brilliant @entity87 the striker reversed some of the farcical luck that has affected him this week by opening the scoring after 43 minutes , but also contrived to miss the target altogether from three yards after @entity41 ’s 74th - minute own goal pulled @entity30 level			1
‘ i think we should have won , ’ said @entity17 who , along with club officials , claimed @entity6 ’s illness was not serious			2
‘ @entity6 has a chest infection so he was watching a live stream on the computer and giving us a few tips on the phone			1
there was a delay on the live stream i think but he was happy with what we did			0
‘ he has taken time off to recover and he should be fine for next week ( when @entity5 play @entity110 in an @entity112 replay on tuesday )			1
’ that game will be an opportunity to address a winless run that now extends to five matches in all competitions			0
hardly cause for major concern for a side that always faced a formidable task in replicating their form of the first half of the season			0
@entity27 rifled his left footed shot into the top corner past @entity30 goalkeeper @entity45 @entity45 dives to his left but he is unable to stop @entity27 's shot from flying into the net what will bother @entity6 , though , is how some of their clear openings were not turned into goals before @entity30 levelled			1
@entity30 are lobbying for the goal to be credited to @entity31 , whose header had struck @entity41 after bouncing back of a post			1
one would expect those efforts given the @entity33 's need for confidence in his mission to replace @entity144			0
@entity31 celebrated that moment with a @entity33 flag in memory of those killed in the @entity150 massacre			1
there was evident joy in the moment , but it remains to be seen if , primarily , he is up to replacing @entity144 , and also if he stays in @entity13			0
clubs are interested and he has not been shy in encouraging the admirers			0
@entity156 said : ‘ i hope they give him the goal , he deserves it for the hard work he did			0
he is a top striker - there was not much to choose between him and @entity144			2
' i brought him in and he has been frustrated but he has shown his qualities and he has a run to keep getting better			0
‘ the goal meant a lot for him			0
he wanted to show the flag			0
it was a very good gesture for the people hurt in @entity36 and that was a really nice touch			1
’ @entity5 goalkeeper @entity64 celebrates @entity27 's goal by clenching his fists and sliding on his knees @entity27 wheels away in celebration after scoring the opening goal against @entity30 former @entity175 goalkeeper @entity45 was unable to get anywhere near @entity27 's first - half strike @entity178 collects the @entity33 national flag before celebrating with his team - mates an emotional @entity31 celebrates with the @entity33 national flag to show his support to the people who died in @entity36 @entity30 defender @entity46 celebrates after @entity5 's @entity41 puts through his own net @entity30 winger @entity51 is tackled by @entity184 during the @entity186 clash @entity43 is closely watched by @entity187 as the @entity5 midfielder attempts to carry the ball forward @entity66 leaps above @entity30 's defence to head towards goal ( left ) and @entity46 clears the ball while under pressure from @entity27 @entity17 took charge of @entity5 as manager @entity6 missed the trip due to a chest infection @entity30 boss @entity156 barks out instructions during the @entity186 encounter at the @entity44 @entity31 was less than convincing with his finishing in the first , most notably when he was presented with a sight at goal in the 30th minute and dallied			1
he cut inside to his right foot rather than swinging the left and allowed @entity65 to block			0
would @entity144 have been so hesitant ? @entity5 improved , took control some excellent passing and led through @entity27 ’ s magnificent goal			1
he chested a @entity43 cross , evaded three men and found the top corner from the edge of the area			0
not bad at the end of a week in which he missed a fixture with an injured foot – he kicked the floor in training – and sliced open his finger while making lunch			0
he now has four goals and three assists in six @entity186 games against @entity30			1
it should have been five goals but he blew an excellent late chance after @entity41 ’s own goal			2
if @entity6 's feed caught the moment his bed rest might have failed to fulfil its purpose .			2

@entity5 striker @entity27 scored opener just before the half - time interval
@entity41 put through his own net in the 74th minute to hand @entity30 a point
@entity31 celebrated his goal by paying *tribute* to the innocent people who died in @entity36 terrorist attack
@entity6 missed the @entity186 match due to a chest infection
