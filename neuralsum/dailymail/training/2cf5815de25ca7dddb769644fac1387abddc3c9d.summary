by @entity0 when @entity1 started posting pictures of her miserable school dinners online , she realised it may ruffle a few feathers			1
but the nine - year - old never expected her blog to spark a full - scale internet revolt after council bureaucrats tried to ban her from telling the truth about her canteen meals			1
the young campaigner also could not have predicted the blog 's huge popularity would generate more than £ 60,000 in donations to help feed impoverished children around the world			1
however , angry about the headlines @entity23 ’s ‘ @entity1 ’ blog was generating , officials at @entity20 council ordered teachers to stop her from photographing her dinners and rating them online			1
good cause : @entity23 's blog , @entity1 , has raised more than £ 60,000 since she first started it victory ! @entity1 , 9 , and her father @entity31 were all smiles after the council 's decision to make a u-turn on banning her food blog blog over : last night @entity23 posted a goodbye message in a post headed ‘ goodbye , ’ she wrote : ‘ this morning in maths i got taken out of class by my head teacher and taken to her office			1
‘ i was told that i could not take any more photos of my school dinners			1
’ but the officials seriously underestimated the youngster ’s internet following and thousands of people , led by celebrity chef @entity50 , took to @entity51 to criticise their decision , leading to a humiliating u-turn by the council			1
within hours of @entity50 tweeting to @entity23 to ‘ stay strong ’ and urging his 2.3million followers to re-post his message , the schoolgirl ’s blog became one of the top subjects discussed on the site worldwide			2
critics lined up to accuse the council of ‘ bullying ’ @entity23 by trying to ‘ silence her freedom of expression ’ and thousands signed a petition to get them to overturn the ban			2
back for more : the council had tried to shut the blog down before a @entity51 bakclash forced a u-turn supporters inundated council phonelines with complaints and also pledged thousands of pounds to the @entity80 children ’s charity linked to @entity23 ’s blog , smashing her £ 7,000 target			1
donations , from supporters all over the world , including @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , now stand at £ 61,519.07			2
the decision also angered @entity93 education secretary @entity92 , whose intervention forced the council to perform a u-turn			0
council leader @entity97 announced they would be withdrawing the ban with immediate effect			0
he said : ‘ it ’s a good thing to do , to change your mind , and i ’ve certainly done that			0
’ last night @entity23 ’s father , @entity105 , 39 , said common sense had prevailed			0
‘ @entity23 is beaming , ’ he said			0
‘ she came home from school with a big smile on her face			0
‘ she is delighted she can carry on blogging , but more so about the money being raised for the charity			2
people have been very , very generous			0
the way the world reacted to the ban is very revealing , it ’s just fantastic that common sense has prevailed			1
’ food for thought : @entity23 posted this picture on an internet blog and began to add daily snaps of her lunches , rating and commenting on them @entity127 grub : @entity23 's photos of her school dinner has turned her into an overnight internet sensation @entity23 's miserable school dinners look set to spark an outcry over nutrition for the nation 's children the saga began seven weeks ago when @entity23 , with permission from teachers at @entity139 , started taking pictures of her £ 2 school dinners and commenting on them as part of a writing project			1
because @entity23 ’s home is on the west coast of @entity93 , however , standards for school meals differ and widespread improvements in the rest of @entity151 appear not to have been applied			2
her first post included a photo of a measly slice of pizza and a lonely potato croquette , alongside a sprinkling of sweetcorn , a cupcake for dessert and a lot of empty space			0
alongside the photo , the schoolgirl wrote : ‘ the pizza in the first pic was alright but i ’d have enjoyed more than one croquette			0
i ’m a growing kid and i need to concentrate all afternoon and i ca n’t do it on one croquette			0
do any of you think you could ? ’ beside a photograph of a limp looking cheeseburger , two potato croquets , a few rings of cucumber and a rocket ice lolly , @entity23 wrote : ‘ today ’s meal was on the menu as @entity180 and ice cream / biscuit but as you can see i got an ice lolly			0
i wish they had stuck to the menu			0
’ over the next two months her daily snaps gathered an impressive following , with more than two million people throughout the world logging on and sending in their own pictures for her site			0
after seeing the photographs , @entity50 , a veteran school food campaigner , sent a tweet to her father , which read : ‘ shocking but inspirational blog			1
big love from @entity199 ’ @entity23 later posted that the celebrity chef had sent her a copy of his @entity50 ’s @entity151 cookbook in which he wrote : ‘ @entity23 , great work ! ! ! clever girl			0
@entity206 keep it up ! ! ’ but on thursday , @entity23 , whose mother is a gp , revealed that teachers wanted her to stop taking the photographs			1
the council said the decision was made after an article published in a tabloid newspaper , under the headline ‘ time to fire the dinner ladies ’ , left some members of staff at the school in tears			2
in an ill - judged 500 - plus word statement , they accused @entity23 ’s blog of being ‘ misleading ’ and attacked her father for refusing to put an end to it			2
mr @entity105 , who runs a smallholding , correctly predicted the move was an ‘ own goal ’ which would serve only to generate more criticism because ‘ the pictures tell the story about how good the food is ’			0
last night the @entity20 - based @entity236 , the charity supported by @entity23 ’s blog , revealed she had raised enough to build several kitchens for starving children in @entity240			1
the charity said : ‘ @entity23 ’s support for @entity236 has been amazing and we are extremely grateful for everything that she has done to help us reach some of the hungriest children in the world			1
’ @entity246 hit : @entity23 's fearless exposé of daily fare at her ( unnamed ) school prompted global discussion about shockingly unhealthy food being served @entity23 's @entity1 blog has chalked up a million hits			1
she is supervised by her father @entity31 ( left )			0
