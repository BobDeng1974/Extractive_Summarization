former cia director @entity0 has told @entity1 that the @entity2 believed almost immediately that @entity4 - linked terrorists were behind the september 11th attacks in @entity6 , according to a leading @entity8 congressman			1
representative @entity9 , a member of the @entity10 that @entity0 briefed , said that the former general left a ' different impression ' today than he had when he testified on @entity13 three days after the attack			1
now , @entity9 said , @entity0 insisted that the ' original talking points prepared by the @entity2 were different than the final ones put out ' and used by @entity17 , @entity18 ambassador to the @entity19 , on sunday talk shows to say - incorrectly - that the attack was sparked by anger over an anti-islam video made in @entity24			1
the former @entity2 director was giving classified testimony and was accompanied by a @entity2 analyst			0
@entity9 said he did not speak under oath			0
@entity0 arrived early friday for closed hearings on @entity13 as lawmakers seek details from the retired general about the sept. 11 attack on the @entity18 @entity54 in @entity6 , @entity55 , that killed the @entity18 ambassador and three other @entity18			1
@entity9 said that there was only brief mention by @entity0 of his affair with biographer @entity60 , which triggered his shock resignation last friday			1
' he was asked at the start did that have any impact on his testimony , he said no.			0
.10 seconds into it , that was off to the side			0
' after the closed door hearing rep. @entity9 told the media that @entity0 's original talking points were different than the ones put out by the @entity74 and @entity17 looking for answers : packs of reporters and camera crews were on hand at the @entity18 @entity13 hoping to catch @entity0 at the highly - anticipated , closed - door hearing of the @entity10 but only found committee members like @entity83 rep. @entity82 in defense : @entity0 testified that the original @entity2 talking points showed a clear @entity4 involvement that @entity17 ignored in her later statements circus : @entity0 ' affair with writer @entity60 turned the days testimony into a media circus as writers and photographers scrambled catch the general the @entity96 congressman said that @entity0 had explained that the talking points ultimately used by @entity98 had been altered by inputs by a number of other government agencies after the @entity2 had made its assessment			1
' he said that it goes though a long process , an interagency process and when they came back it was taken out			0
' the @entity10 , which was hearing from @entity0 before he briefed the @entity108 , met in a secure room several floors below the main area of the @entity112 , where tourists gather when they are visiting @entity1			1
republicans and some @entity115 have demanded an explanation of why the @entity118 administration initially described the attack at @entity6 as a protest gone awry , leading to the deaths of @entity18 ambassador @entity122 , diplomat @entity123 and @entity2 contractors and former @entity125 and @entity126			2
guarded : police officers guard the @entity128 as the @entity10 conducts a hearing on @entity6 with testimony from @entity0 on record : these stairs lead to the @entity133			1
friday morning testimony happened in a secure room several floors below the main area of the @entity138 five days after attack , the administration sent @entity98 onto the sunday news shows to describe what precipitated the assault			2
she relied on initial intelligence talking points that subsequently proved incorrect			1
deputy cia director @entity146 told the @entity147 on thursday that @entity98 was provided with an unclassified version of events at the @entity18 mission , according to rep. @entity151 , @entity152 , a committee member			0
the assessment concluded that a spontaneous protest over an @entity156 video had evolved into an attack on the @entity18 consulate , a description that @entity98 presented in the television interviews			2
@entity0 hoped that by testifying he would put an end to some of the wilder rumors following his resignation over reveal of his affair with @entity60			1
' he did not like the conspiracies going around that somehow he had something to hide on @entity6 , ' said retired colonel @entity169 , who served as @entity0 ' executive officer in @entity171			1
' i think his offer to testify crossed with the @entity1 ' request to him to testify			0
but anyway he looks forward to that			0
' @entity0 , former @entity2 director , has testified on @entity13 that ' talking points ' on @entity6 initially prepared by the @entity2 were subsequently altered before being given to ambassador @entity17			1
far from expressing spontaneous or even personal opinions , @entity118 administration officials appearing on sunday talk shows , as @entity98 did in the aftermath of the september 11th @entity6 attack , are given a virtual script beforehand			2
these are usually distributed on saturday night , when a conference call or meeting is held to go over key points			2
as president @entity118 put in this week , @entity98 ' made an appearance at the request of the @entity74 in which she gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her '			0
when foreign policy is involved , these ' talking points ' are coordinated by the @entity193 after inputs from agencies throughout the @entity18 government			1
representative @entity9 of the @entity10 spoke on friday of an ' interagency process ' that @entity0 had said had changed the initial @entity2 assessment of the events in @entity6			1
' he said that the talking points that were drafted [ by the @entity2 ] were specific about an @entity4 affiliate ... after they went through that process , whatever that process is , which they seem unclear about , that was taken out			1
' @entity9 added that he had ' got the impression about seven , eight , nine different agencies ' had been involved in drafting the talking points			1
there are 16 different agencies in the @entity18 intelligence community			0
in addition , it is overseen by the @entity213 ( @entity213 ) , which almost certainly would have had an input			0
in the case of @entity6 , the @entity218 ( @entity218 ) , @entity215 ( @entity215 ) and @entity216 would almost certainly have been involved in drafting the talking points			1
the @entity220 would also have had a key role , perhaps drawing on work from its @entity223 ( @entity223 ) , one of the 16 @entity18 intelligence agencies			0
as well as the @entity218 input , the @entity227 and perhaps the @entity18 @entity228 would have been consulted			0
representative @entity151 , a @entity229 , said that @entity0 had disputed @entity8 suggestions that politics were involved in altering the talking points			1
' there was an inter-agency process to draft it , not a political process			0
they came up with the best assessment without compromising classified information or sources or methods			0
so changes were made to protect classified information			0
' ' the general was adamant there was no politicisation of the process , no @entity74 interference or political agenda			0
- by @entity249 ' i think his offer to testify crossed with the @entity1 ' request to him to testify			0
but anyway , he looks forward to that			0
' this comes as the former @entity2 director told his close friend @entity169 that he was ignoring the media firestorm that has erupted in the wake of his resignation			2
@entity0 hopes that by offering to give testimony he will clear up some of the wilder rumours that are circulating			1
' he did not like the conspiracies going around that somehow he had something to hide on @entity6 , ' said retired colonel @entity169 who served as @entity0 ' executive officer in @entity171			1

with dozens of journalists waiting for a glimpse of the retired four - star general , and a chance to ask about his affair with writer @entity60 , @entity0 resorted to cloak - and - dagger techniques to sneak into the hearing on the sept. 11 attacks in @entity6 undetected			2
@entity0 stole into the @entity10 hearing through a network of underground hallways leading to a secure room , his entrance hidden from the cameras			2
@entity2 directors usually walk through the building 's front door			0
@entity0 is under investigation by the agency for possible wrongdoing though for the day at least that was not the subject of his appearance			2
lawmakers said they were looking forward to hearing @entity0 ' thoughts on the attacks			2
' @entity294 went to @entity295 and interviewed many of the people involved , ' said head of the @entity108 committee , @entity24 democrat @entity300			0
' id like to get a sense of why it took as long as it did to get a more accurate assessment of what took place in @entity6 , ' said @entity24 @entity115 rep. @entity151 .			0

@entity0 testified that he always knew the attack was linked to @entity4
