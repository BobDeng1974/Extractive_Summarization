by @entity0 published : 22:14 est , 9 september 2012 updated : 01:49 est , 10 september 2012 @entity1 drowned himself in a small boat he scuppered in @entity3 just a few hours after @entity6 's grisly murder , his son has claimed today			1
@entity7 , 45 , believes his father took his own life in the @entity3 's icy waters after guzzling whisky and sleeping pills because he wanted to ' vanish forever '			1
he is certain that his father was worried he was being framed for the nanny 's brutal killing on november 7 , 1974 , and ended his life to protect his family			1
haunted by his past : lord @entity1 's son @entity18 , pictured a few years ago , left , and with his father before his disappearance in 1974 , has spoken for the first time about what he thinks may have happened to him @entity6 , nanny to @entity1 's children , was found dead in @entity24 , @entity25 , in november 1974 mr @entity7 , who was seven at the time of the murder , dismisses claims the 7th @entity29 fled to @entity30 , believing instead that his father committed suicide before dawn lifted the following morning			1
' if you ’re going to find him anywhere , it ’s going to be the bottom of the @entity3 , ' mr @entity7 told the @entity36			2
@entity1 disappeared after 29 - year - old @entity37 , his children 's nanny , was bludgeoned to death and his wife @entity41 battered around the head at their home in @entity24 , @entity25			1
since the killing and the aristocrat 's disappearance , detectives have developed a theory that @entity1 killed @entity37 by mistake , believing she was his wife with whom he was embroiled in divorce proceedings			2
after the nanny was killed and @entity54 attacked , @entity1 fled in a @entity55 borrowed from one of his gambling friends			2
it was found abandoned at @entity59 on the @entity61 coast			0
there were bloodstains on the front seat and a length of lead piping , wrapped in bandages , in the boot			0
that pipe matched a similar weapon found at the murder scene			0
friends and family of @entity1 have said the missing @entity29 probably jumped from a ferry of some cliffs			0
others have speculated that he fled the country and lived as a fugitive , with many suggesting he chose to move to @entity30 to avoid justice			0
but mr @entity7 has a different version of events which he claims to know is true			2
vanished : police believed @entity1 , left , killed @entity6 , right , after mistaking her for his wife @entity41 mystery : @entity1 , is believed to have killed the family nanny , and attacked his then - wife , @entity41 , pictured on his way to the coast , @entity1 had stopped in the dead of night at @entity91 's house , to ask his friend for some sleeping pills			1
mr @entity7 believes his father , a keen sailor , would have then made for a small motor boat somewhere in @entity59 harbour to which he had access			1
' he would have got on board with a bottle of whisky and some pills and taken it out to the 50 metre mark , the point where if you go down you ’re not going to come back up again , but not so far out that you are in the shipping lane , ' mr @entity7 told the @entity36			2
' as the pills kicked in , he would have opened up the bottom of the boat and let the water in			0
' mr @entity7 believes his father would have been unconscious by the time the boat began to sink			1
he believes hypothermia would have overcome the aristocrat before water even reached his lungs			0
a coroner , in the absence of the prime suspect , declared in 1975 that @entity1 had indeed killed @entity37			0
mr @entity7 believes his father did not murder the pretty nanny , but added that he hoped he was partly culpable because it would make his disappearance easier to cope with			1
lady @entity122 , left , pictured in @entity25 1994 and right , at the coroner 's inquest in 1975 mr @entity7 believes that his father would not have absconded , leaving his children ( which included sisters @entity128 and @entity129 ) behind without real reason			1
and that 's why he hopes his father did have some part to play in that tragic night 's events			2
the graphic nature of the killing and in particular the amount of blood that was found at the scene , leads @entity7 to suspect that one or more parties were involved in the murder , yet he does not entirely discount his father being one of them			1
he does , however , disagree with the version of events according to his mother , with whom he no longer has contact with , believing that the state of her relationship with @entity1 at the time clouded her details of fact			0
@entity1 left two letters behind addressed to his brother in law @entity153 , written on the night of the murder			0
in these letters the tone is clear that he was not to return , giving details of his banking details and estate			0
the second letter , in particular , is most interesting			0
in it , he refers to a ' fight ' he broke up at the property , and that a man left following the assaults			0
mr @entity7 told the @entity36 he hopes that what his father wrote in the second letter was actually false and that his father was , in some way , involved			2
no matter what his father 's involvement , mr @entity7 says it is beyond doubt that his father killed himself and tells of his frustration that some still suggest he is alive and in @entity30 .			1

@entity7 says he is certain his father killed himself just hours after the death of his nanny @entity6 at the family home in @entity24 , @entity25
he believes his father wanted to ' vanish forever ' to protect his family from the *ignominy* of his being *accused* of the 29 - year - old 's murder
