but @entity10 has just outdone @entity11 by releasing these mind - blowing real life ‘ gravity ’ images revealing incredible scenes of @entity16 , astronauts and space shuttles			1
while @entity21 ’s film relies heavily on computer - generated imagery , the space agency has shown that our galaxy is far more beautiful than anything a film director could create			1
the city lights of @entity28 and @entity29 define the @entity30 in this photograph from the @entity32 ( @entity32 )			1
several large metropolitan areas are visible , marked by their relatively large and brightly lit areas , including the capital cities of @entity36 , @entity28 - located near the centre of the peninsula			0
the astronaut view is looking toward the east the ‘ gravity : @entity10 ’s real - life images from space ’ series uses photos taken over the last several years and covers everything from space walks to the final landing on @entity16			1
some of the most stunning are of views from the @entity32 of our planet by night			1
in one image , the city lights of @entity28 and @entity29 are clearly visible			1
several large metropolitan areas can be seen , including the capital city of @entity36			2
the bright sun greets the @entity32 in this november 22 scene from the @entity57 section of the orbital outpost , photographed by one of the astronauts mission specialist @entity61 , is seen further away from the confines and safety of his ship than any previous astronaut has ever been			2
this space first was made possible by the @entity68 or @entity69 , a nitrogen jet propelled backpack			0
@entity61 went free - flying to a distance of 320 feet ( 98 metres ) away from the orbiter			0
this image was taken in 1984 the thin line of @entity16 's atmosphere and the setting sun are featured in this image photographed by a crew member on the @entity32 while space shuttle @entity80 ( left ) from 220 miles above @entity16 , one of the @entity83 crew members took another night time photo featuring the bright lights of @entity86 and @entity87 , @entity88 on the @entity90 coast			1
the @entity91 and its delta stand out clearly and , on the horizon , the airglow of the atmosphere is seen across the @entity90			0
@entity10 also takes a look back at landmarks in spacewalks , such as that set by mission specialist @entity61 over two decades ago			0
in a 1984 image , @entity61 is seen further away from the confines and safety of his ship than any previous astronaut has ever been			0
the thin line of @entity16 's atmosphere and the setting sun are featured in this image photographed by a crew member on the @entity32 while space shuttle @entity80 remains docked with the station in 2009 @entity110 made the @entity112 ' first spacewalk on 3 june 1965 during the @entity114 mission ( left ) @entity7 floating in space ( right ) most of the images from the film were created using computer software this unique photographic angle , featuring the @entity32 's @entity123 and crew activity inside it , other hardware belonging to the station , city lights on @entity16 and airglow was captured by one of the expedition 28 crew members			1
the major urban area on the coast is @entity130 , @entity131			0
the station was passing over an area southwest of @entity134 expedition 27 flight engineer @entity139 peeks out of a window of the @entity141 shortly after she and commander @entity136 and flight engineer @entity137 landed southeast of the town of @entity143 , @entity144 , on tuesday , may 24 , 2011 this space first was made possible by the @entity68 or @entity69 , a nitrogen jet propelled backpack			0
@entity61 went free - flying to a distance of 320 feet ( 98 metres ) away from the orbiter			0
but it ’s not just space flight that can provide moving views of an expedition			0
candid shots of astronauts coming back down to @entity16 reveal the how arduous space flight can be			1
last night , @entity158 swept the board at the 86th @entity4 with seven @entity4 , including best visual effects , cinematography and original score			1
from 220 miles above @entity16 , one of the @entity83 crew members on the @entity32 took this night time photo featuring the bright lights of @entity86 and @entity87 , @entity88 on the @entity90 coast			1
the @entity91 and its delta stand out clearly as well			0
on the horizon , the airglow of the atmosphere is seen across the @entity90 this montage of three frames shows the @entity175 spacecraft as it lands with @entity176 commander @entity177 and flight engineers @entity179 and @entity180 near the town of @entity143 , @entity144 on wednesday , june 2 , 2010 astronaut @entity182 , @entity183 flight engineer , used a pistol grip tool as she worked on the @entity32 in the first of three spacewalks slated to occur over a nine - day period			2
during the 7 - hour 55 - minute spacewalk that took place in 2007 a picturesque line of thunderstorms and numerous circular cloud patterns filled the view as the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) expedition 20 crew members looked out at the limb ( blue line on the horizon ) of the @entity16 a close - up of astronaut @entity199 shows the reflection of astronaut @entity201 , perched on the robotic arm and taking the photo			2
the pair teamed together on three of the five spacewalks during @entity207 in may 2009 commenting on the film last year , @entity208 , who retired in 2012 as a @entity10 director for the @entity32 , said : ‘ my first reaction was that the cinematography was of spectacular realism			2
‘ i ’ve never seen that done before			0
i ’ve never seen a @entity11 filmmaker actually be able to capture that clarity and resolution of the space station and shuttle			2
’ but while @entity158 may have received @entity208 ’s seal of approval , these images show that fact is much more stunning than fiction			2
with his feet secured on a restraint on the space station remote manipulator system 's robotic arm or @entity230 , @entity10 astronaut @entity224 ( frame centre ) holds the @entity232 payload , which was the focus of one of the primary chores accomplished on a six and a half hour spacewalk on july 12 2011 @entity57 support personnel work to help get @entity239 crew members out of the @entity241 spacecraft shortly after the capsule landed with @entity239 commander @entity224 , and flight engineers @entity243 and @entity245 in a remote area outside of the town of @entity248 , @entity144 , on tuesday , november 22 , 2011			0
