by @entity0 at under eight feet wide , most people would automatically pity the owners of this narrow house			1
but far from being cramped , this home gives a new meaning to the phrase ' good things come in small packages ' , as behind its thin door is a sprawling property that actually spreads to 22ft wide			1
@entity12 and @entity13 have really made the most of their space after they purchased the period property in 2009			2
the @entity18 surprises people with its extensive space behind its narrow front door @entity12 and @entity13 's ' skinny house ' in @entity23 , which has a surprising amount of light and space the narrow door belies the spacious interior inside the south west @entity30 property @entity12 and @entity13 decided to make the most of their space - and even have a garden as part of their home nicknamed ' the @entity37 ' as it starts off thin before growing wide at the rear , the couple have extended the 721 square feet of space and being granted the right for a home extension			1
and with a little creative thinking , the pair have transformed the 7ft 7ins wide place in @entity23 , south west @entity30 , the @entity43 reported			1
despite appearances the home , which the @entity49 call ' the @entity18 ' because people can not believe ' how big it is once you get inside ' , accommodates four bedrooms , a long , thin garden , and a generously spaced kitchen			1
to appease planners , who would only grant the property a three floor extension if the roof could n't been seen from the street , as it is in a conservation area , a ' ski - slope roof ' was created , which slopes down to wards the back and has skylights to allow in			2
by using a sloping roof , more bedrooms could be built within the property , adding to its value as the property extends and widens at the rear , creative uses of space make this tiny home feel a lot bigger clever space solutions mean that the room has ample space for the family 's belongings - and amazes people with its roomy interior there 's certainly no slim pickings of where to relax in the house , as the roof meant they could maximise space by using slanted ceilings for bedrooms and a dining area built over the former patio , reached by walking through the kitchen , living room and the lobby			1
clever use of space includes wall to ceiling shelves for books and photographs , while huge glass doors give the place a feeling of airiness , the @entity43 reported			0
a shower room and a dining area that opens on to the garden has meant that the value of the house has nearly double			0
it was purchased for £ 430,000 , but is now estimated to be worth between £ 750,000 and £ 800,000			0
and their new spacious home with its increased value will undoubtedly be the envy of many a young would - be home - owner , who along with millions is struggling to get on to the property ladder			2
the couple 's property - nicknamed ' the wedge ' - has now almost doubled in value since they extended it do n't judge a book by its cover : the cramped - looking house is actually home to four bedrooms , a shower room , a dining room and a charming garden around one in three homeowners in @entity135 are pensioners as crippling house prices freeze younger generations off the property ladder , official figures revealed last week			1

by comparison , there are just 2.6million ‘ owner occupiers ’ in the 35 to 44 age group , the age at which parents are raising a young family , with many desperate to do so in their own @entity168 the number between the age of 25 and 34 , also with young families but likely to have had to pay an even higher price for their home , is nearly half this number at just 1.4million .			0
