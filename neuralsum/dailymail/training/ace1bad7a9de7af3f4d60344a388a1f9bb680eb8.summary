by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 10:13 est , 5 september 2013 a mother - of - three who survived breast cancer has had to have all of her toes amputated after developing a ‘ preventable ’ infection following reconstructive surgery			1
@entity7 , 41 , is also facing the possibility that her legs might now have to be amputated below the knees			1
the community support worker from @entity12 , @entity13 , would not have developed the infection had she been given the antibiotics she should have had after surgery			1
she would not have developed the infection if the doctor had given her antibiotics ms @entity7 was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 37			1
she went on a healthy - eating diet and lost two bra sizes as a result of which she was able to feel the lump in her breast			2
she visited her gp who quickly referred her to hospital where the cancer was diagnosed			2
she told @entity32 ’s @entity31 : ‘ it [ was ] a surreal moment			2
it ’s one of those that … it ’s almost like it will never happen to you			2
‘ you just ca n’t start to begin … where do you go from there ? ‘ there are so many questions , so many feelings , emotions running through you			2
you do n’t know where to begin			2
’ ms @entity7 developed organ failure and nearly died after the operation			1
as her body fought for life , her blood was channeled towards her vital organs so her extremities were deprived of oxygen meaning they died ms @entity7 , who has a 22 - year - old son and two teenage daugthers , had a single mastectomy and four months of chemotherapy			1
during her treatment , she learned that her grandmother had died of ovarian cancer – until that point ms @entity7 believed she had died of colon cancer			1
this raised alarm bells with ms @entity7 who feared that this family history meant that she was more likely to see her cancer return in the future			1
therefore , she decided to have her other breast , her ovaries and her fallopian tubes removed as well			1
once she had recovered from these operations , she started to think about reconstructive breast surgery			1
ms @entity7 says that without her toes she struggles to balance and that she often falls over			1
she says that it has changed the way she walks meaning that her knees , hips and back are being damaged as well in february 2011 she was admitted to @entity79 in @entity80 where she had surgery to reconstruct her breasts			1
when she woke after the surgery , she was horrified to discover that the surgery had not gone as she expected			2
she told @entity31 : ‘ the first thing you do is to have a look as this is the final stage			2
this is the end of the road			0
‘ you have gone through everything and this is the final bit to become normal again , as such			0
‘ when i looked down i realised that everything was wrong , it was misshaped			0
‘ it just did n’t look right in any way			0
i just could n’t believe what i was seeing			0
’ she added : ‘ i was devastated			0
i ca n’t tell you – it was heart - breaking			0
‘ i had stayed so strong and positive all the way through			0
i was really trying to keep as strong as possible to prove to my daughters that there is no fear – because , obviously , their future is now in question as well [ because of the family history of cancer ]			1
’ she told this morning : ' it 's very difficult			0
your balance is always affected			0
you are never stable , never ever stable			0
there are many times you just go down ' this was far from the end of ms @entity7 ’s suffering			1
the week after her surgery , she became so ill and delirious that she lost control of all of her bodily functions			2
her friends were so concerned that they called an ambulance and she was rushed to hospital			0
here , it was discovered that she had developed an infection that was causing her organs to fail			1
she was put in a medically induced coma and given life - saving drugs			0
however , the drugs caused more complications – ms @entity7 explained that because her body was fighting to survive , her blood was all being channelled into her brain and torso meaning that her fingers and toes were deprived of oxygen			1
as a result , they started to turn black			0
ms @entity7 said : ‘ i had never seen anything like it			1
’ she was told to go home and that the toes would die and fall of naturally			2
ms @entity7 had one of her breasts removed during her cancer treatment			1
she then discovered that she had a family history of cancer so decided to have her other breast and her reproductive organs removed as well however , she developed gangrene and had to return to hospital to have her toes amputated			1
she told this morning : ‘ it ’s very difficult			0
your balance is always affected			0
you are never stable , never ever stable			0
there are many times you just go down			0
‘ the foot also suffers with lots of problems , the knees suffer , the hips suffer , the back suffers			2
‘ it just goes on and on			0
the foot starts to collapse slowly			0
then you face more amputations			0
‘ the question is where they have to amputate next			0
they are questioning having to amputate just below the knee now			0
’ she added : ‘ you ’ve got to keep going , if you do n’t keep going then you are going to just sit down			0
it ’s a sink or swim question			0
if you do n’t , what will the children do without you ? ’ ms @entity7 ’s solicitor , @entity173 from @entity174 and @entity175 , said : ‘ this is a very straightforward error that could have been prevented			1
‘ the reason @entity179 is faced with the difficulties she now has is because the hospital failed to prescribe antibiotics after the surgery			1
’ ms @entity7 's solicitor , @entity173 ( pictured ) from @entity174 and @entity175 , said : ' this is a very straightforward error that could have been prevented ' she added : ‘ all of the consequences that @entity179 is now faced with would have been prevented			1
’ she went on to explain that ms @entity7 should have been given antibiotics after the reconstructive surgery to prevent infection but that the hospital trust has admitted that the doctor failed to prescribe them			1
ms @entity7 is now agreeing a settlement with @entity194			2
a spokesperson for the trust said : ' we are very sorry that ms @entity7 did n’t receive the level of care she expected at our hospital in february 2011			1
' following an investigation , we identified that our processes fell below the standards we would expect and we could have done more			0
' we wrote a letter of apology to mrs @entity7 on 28 october 2011 , and this case is now with our legal department to agree a settlement			1
' this was an extremely rare case , and we have reviewed and improved our processes around patient communication and discharge protocol as a direct result of the investigation into ms @entity7 's care			2
