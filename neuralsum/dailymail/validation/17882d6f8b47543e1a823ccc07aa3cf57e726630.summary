@entity0 and @entity1 are set to challenge @entity2 for the services of @entity4 this summer			1
the pressure on @entity4 at @entity6 has intensified in recent weeks and a move back to the @entity8 is on the cards			1
it has been assumed that if @entity4 does leave @entity6 then a move to @entity2 is a ' shoo - in '			1
but both @entity1 and @entity0 are in need of attacking stimulus , especially in the context of @entity16 football			1
@entity4 is attracting criticism in the @entity19 capital and @entity1 and @entity0 are interested the reality is that it will be how each club manage to finance a £ 100million deal plus near £ 300,000 - a - week wages and stay within @entity25 rules			1
and in the case of @entity2 they have priorities in other areas of the pitch			2
@entity1 , on the basis of transfer sales and turnover , will have the ability to push the boat out to get @entity4			1
the @entity36 are also looking to sign @entity6 centre - half @entity37			2
@entity1 could demand as much as £ 20million this summer to let @entity38 leave the club			1
in what may well be a merry - go - round of elite goalkeepers this summer , @entity38 is a target for @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity2 , @entity6 and @entity47			1
although @entity38 is now @entity1 ’s no 2 , he is still just 32			1
former @entity44 keeper @entity48 has urged the @entity49 to sign @entity38 , arguing that he could well be entering the best period of his career			2
@entity38 is wanted by a raft of top clubs and @entity44 have been urged to sign him by @entity48 @entity46 are prepared to play poker with @entity55 and his advisors over a new contract			1
and the @entity59 club remain convinced they will win			0
the @entity60 do n’t believe there is genuine , firm interest from clubs such as @entity64 , @entity6 , @entity1 or @entity2 as has been reported , as talks over a new £ 100,000 a week deal have repeatedly stalled			1
certainly @entity46 believe that if they slap a £ 50million - plus price tag on the @entity70 forward then none of those clubs would make a move this summer			1
@entity55 is reportedly wanted by @entity73 's elite , but @entity46 are n't buying that talks on a bumper £ 1000,000 - a - week deal have stalled between @entity78 and @entity46 indeed the club believe @entity55 constantly being linked with a range of ' platinum ' clubs is part of a strategy from the player ’s camp to force their hand and offer wages of up to £ 140,000 a week - the sort of level @entity91 and @entity93 were on			1
but the view of the @entity46 hierarchy is that in stages of progression @entity55 does not yet command such a figure in the context of their wage structure nor in how they deal with @entity25 regulations			2
the club want @entity55 to understand that the current offer is generous , especially given that despite his rapid emergence he has yet to prove himself as a consistent force , and that a new £ 100,000 - a - week five - year deal would have re-negotiation stages built in			0
the obvious concern of the club is that if they bow to the demands of @entity55 ’s advisors now , they could have a talented 20 - year - old player on their hands who suddenly lacks sufficient motivation and incentive to fulfil his potential			0
@entity120 bluntly told @entity78 not to wave goodbye to @entity46 it was telling that manager @entity120 said pointedly on saturday : ‘ i think it is quite obvious when you look at it is that anyone with his [ @entity55 ’s ] best interests at heart knows his best option is to sign a new deal for @entity46			1
’ the club also does n’t want to unsettle the rest of the squad by bowing to @entity78 's demands			1
@entity46 are also relaxed about the situation not least because @entity55 ’s current contract does not expire until the summer of 2017			2
@entity137 's days are numbered as @entity139 manager			1
the club are set to sever his contract on may 25 , the day after the last game of the season against @entity142			0
even if the @entity139 have a good end to the season there is no way back for @entity137 whose current contract expires in july			2
the 3 - 0 defeat at @entity44 took @entity139 's @entity8 run to just one win in 12			1
@entity137 looks aggrieved during @entity139 's latest capitulation at the @entity154 the @entity139 board still harbour hopes of luring @entity157 to the club next season from @entity160 in their last season at the @entity162 before moving to the @entity163			1
the club ’s hierarchy see former cult hero @entity157 as a platinum signing that can help attract a new fan base			2
@entity157 is wanted by the @entity139 as a marquee signing in their final year at @entity162 @entity170 could move for @entity1 ’s misfit striker @entity171 this summer if they decide to cash in on wantaway @entity172			1
@entity173 , as revealed by the @entity174 , will not stay at @entity2 beyond this season ’s loan deal from @entity177 , where indeed the @entity178 could well be playing his football again next season			2
@entity173 could return to @entity177 after a frustrating first year in the @entity8 i am hearing @entity45 ’s @entity182 is set to get an @entity70 call - up for the @entity185 qualifier against @entity186 later this month to prevent him opting to declare for @entity187			0
btw @entity93 last week claimed it was @entity189 media which forced him to quit @entity46 last summer and join @entity190			0
the main reason @entity93 left @entity46 is because he had been hankering for a dream move to @entity194 for over a year			0
and he also wanted to nearly double his salary			0
@entity93 looks glum as @entity46 's title hopes evaporate on a crazy night at @entity197 last year @entity93 grins from ear to ear as the @entity200 is turning it on for @entity203 leaders @entity190 yes the press reported various indiscretions by the @entity200 , including a race row , a propensity to dive and a habit of assaulting opponents from time to time			2
that ’s part of the job			0
what did @entity93 expect ? high fives ? or flowers ? yet for all that , the @entity189 press still honoured @entity93 last season when the @entity220 ( @entity220 ) voted him as their player of the year			0
that ’s hardly hounding a player out , is it ? @entity225 @entity226 labelled the behaviour of @entity1 players in @entity16 defeat by @entity47 as a ‘ disgrace ’			0
fellow @entity232 pundit @entity231 described the manner in which the @entity1 players pressurised referee @entity235 to send off @entity236 as pathetic			0
@entity236 called the @entity1 players ‘ babies ’			0
i ca n’t disagree with any of those verdicts			0
i just found it embarrassing			0
yet in the commentary box , @entity241 almost paid the @entity1 players a compliment by calling them ‘ shrewd ’			0
really ? @entity1 players surround @entity235 as the @entity246 official sends off @entity236 matches between @entity2 and @entity45 have often been entertaining and full of goals down the years , although this season ’s encounter at @entity251 ended 0 - 0			1
coral offer 12 - 1 on the same outcome			0
for the more adventurous , they offer 50 - 1 for 3 - 3			0
@entity255 is 6 - 1 to be first scorer			0
shrewd is being clever , not cheating then is it ? does an employee of the @entity259 has a role as @entity70 boss @entity262 ’s assistant - advocate cheating ? let ’s not forget one of the main roles of the @entity266 is to act as custodians of the game , uphold discipline and even offer a moral lead			0
once again there would seem a conflict of interest with @entity241 being an opinionated media pundit and a senior member of the @entity70 coaching staff			0
after all , do we want to see @entity70 players acting in the same pathetic manner , as @entity231 put it , as the @entity1 players did last week ? i think not .			2

@entity4 's *suitors* now include @entity1 and @entity0
@entity1 may put a £ 20m price tag on @entity38
@entity139 want a *sensational* *reunion* with @entity157
@entity46 are convinced there is no interest from @entity64 , @entity6 , @entity1 or @entity2 in @entity78
and they will test that theory by slapping on a £ 50m price tag
