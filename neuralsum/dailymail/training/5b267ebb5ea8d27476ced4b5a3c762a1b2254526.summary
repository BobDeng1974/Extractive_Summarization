@entity0 was more than happy to let @entity1 do the talking on monday when it came to questions about the @entity5 goalkeeper waiting for a new contract offer from @entity7			1
on the issue of being rested for the last two games , however , @entity0 was more vocal			1
he does not like it and will probably never appreciate the positives of having a breather			2
at least not until he is long retired			2
this was hardly on the same scale of rebellion as @entity16 with @entity17 , but it was an awkward moment as @entity0 sat beside his manager to discuss tuesday night ’s @entity21 clash with @entity22 at the @entity23			1
@entity1 has restored @entity0 to his starting xi for tuesday night 's clash with @entity22 @entity0 will get another chance to impress @entity1 as he battles for the no 1 spot even at this early stage of the campaign , the tie has a make - or - break feel to it after @entity7 ’s defeat by @entity34 in their opening group e match and the @entity37 ’ 5 - 1 win over @entity38			1
another defeat for the @entity41 champions would seriously damage their hopes of reaching the knockout phase			2
@entity1 is taking no chances and will recall @entity0 in place of @entity46 , who played against @entity47 and @entity48			1
@entity0 , @entity5 ’s no 1 , could have talked up the benefits of having a rest or extolled the virtues of squad rotation			1
@entity0 is not happy with bench duty after watching the wins against @entity47 and @entity48 ‘ i want to play every game , that is my nature , my professionalism , ’ he said			1
‘ i am not the manager , just a player			2
i live by the decisions of the manager			2
’ @entity1 sat impassively as @entity0 continued : ‘ we ’ve always had good goalkeepers since i ’ve been here going back to @entity64 , ( @entity66 ) @entity65 , @entity67 ( @entity68 ) , @entity69 , ( @entity70 ) @entity71 and @entity72			1
‘ it has always been a fight for me to keep my place			2
i ’ve got high standards that i like to keep to , whether i ’m the only goalkeeper or one of 20			2
i love challenging for my place and i love playing and that will never change			2
’ but can @entity0 at least see the benefits of taking a back seat ? @entity0 will be hoping to replicate his display against @entity34 in the last group game he might be @entity22 ’s most iconic player , but @entity83 he has never won a game or even scored in his nine visits to @entity5			1
@entity22 have lost their last three games in @entity87			1
they lost 1 - 0 twice and were smashed 7 - 1 in the quarter finals in 2007 , all at @entity90			0
@entity91 enjoys playing at home in the @entity21			0
he has five goals in his last five home games			0
it took him 10 games to reach the same total in the league			0
@entity22 have not kept a clean sheet in their last nine games in the @entity21 , letting in on average two goals in each			1
‘ it ’s hard for me to see it that way , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m sure that when i retire i ’ll see them but right now i ’m not going to see positives			0
’ that is unlikely to bother @entity1			0
@entity0 was dropped for seven league games last season and bringing in £ 6million @entity110 in the summer was designed to put more pressure on him			1
further doubts were raised over @entity0 ’s place earlier this month but a magnificent performance in @entity115 helped end that particular debate , even though he was beaten by a 90th - minute winner from former @entity7 defender @entity118			1
it ’s worth noting that former city defender @entity120 is back in town on tuesday night , as is @entity122			1
@entity0 was asked if he would ever consider following @entity122 , his former @entity5 team - mate , to @entity125 ’s @entity124 also moved to @entity126 in the summer , joining @entity127			1
@entity0 sees no positives in being rested and is keen to play every game @entity122 was ' brave ' to move to @entity126 , according to former @entity5 teammate @entity0 @entity7 have lost three @entity130 in a row , their worst run in @entity133			1
@entity22 hit five past @entity38 on matchday one — their biggest win in @entity137 competition			1
@entity7 have only won two of their eight games against @entity37 opposition			1
both wins came more than 35 years ago			2
@entity22 were the pass masters on matchday one			1
the three top passers all played for the @entity37			0
‘ @entity145 was brave to make the move , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i ’ve got a lot of respect for the boys who have done it			0
@entity124 seems to be loving it out there but right now i ’m happy with what ’s going on at this club			0
while i am welcome here , i am more than happy to stay and see where that takes me			0
’ @entity7 have given new contracts to a number of key players in recent months , but @entity0 is still waiting even though club insiders insist one will be forthcoming			1
he let @entity1 field that awkward question on monday			0
‘ me and @entity166 know what ’s happening with that issue , ’ said the city manager , who will be back in the dugout after a two - game touchline ban			0
‘ but it ’s not the most important thing at this moment			0
we are thinking about @entity22			2
’ @entity0 admits @entity7 need to get off the mark following defeat in @entity115 last time out @entity7 certainly can not afford to underestimate their opponents even though the @entity37 have won only once in 14 attempts on @entity177 soil			1
that includes three defeats by @entity180 — most memorably a 7 - 1 thrashing in the quarter - finals in 2007			0
however , @entity184 ’s side have a 100 per cent record this season , winning all five @entity188 games as well as that convincing victory over @entity38			0
only two goals have been conceded			0
‘ it ’s obviously a big game after a disappointing start in @entity115 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ luckily it ’s not the knockout phase straightaway			0
‘ we ’ve always had tough groups in our brief @entity21 history			0
they are big nights and we all understand you have to do well at home			0
‘ but we ’ve shown that we can play with the big boys			0
we just need to finish the game off			0

@entity0 will start for @entity7 in tuesday night 's meeting with @entity22 at the @entity23
@entity5 star was benched for wins against @entity47 and @entity48
new signing @entity210 has been preferred to @entity0 between the sticks
