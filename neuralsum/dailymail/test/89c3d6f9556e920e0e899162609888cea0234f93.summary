the first ever mixed race @entity1 has lifted the lid on some of the horrific racial abuse she has faced on her way to the top			0
@entity7 says it was often punishing growing up as the only black girl in her class in the port town of @entity12 near @entity13 , where the @entity14 has a naval base and where her @entity17 - @entity14 father met her @entity19 mother			1
the 20 - year - old was born and raised in @entity19 , speaks fluent @entity19 , and was last month chosen to represent her country in the @entity23 pageant			1
as a youngster ( right ) she grew up in @entity19 some critics of @entity7 's win have complained she is a mixed race ' hafu ' and not @entity19 enough but the beauty queen had to use her first television appearance after her selection to apologetically explain to reporters that while she does n't ' look @entity19 ' on the outside , on the inside there are ' many @entity19 things about her '			1
many in the country have expressed hostility to @entity7 's title win as they expected the award to go to a ' pure ' @entity19 woman and not a ' hafu ' , meaning half @entity19 , which has echoes of the discredited term ' half - caste '			1
' is it okay to choose a hafu to represent @entity19 ? ' one commenter typically wrote online after @entity7 's win			1
speaking about her childhood in an interview with @entity55 , who goes by her mother 's maiden name , said : ' there was pretty much a spasmodic vomit of racial abuse heaped upon me			0
' i was called a n * * * * r by some of my peers			0
some of them threw trash and even a blackboard duster at me			0
' i 'm @entity19 through and through , but in @entity19 if you look " foreign " you are often not accepted as @entity19			2
but i am @entity19 - 100 percent			1
' skin colour bears no relationship to what a person is			0
it 's just one of the differences like wearing blue clothes or wearing red clothes			0
' ' i have no objections against the word ' hafu ' and i accept myself as being hafu			0
' with so little multi-culturalism in @entity19 the term is somehow understandable , although it has made me wonder who i am at times			2
' @entity7 has been inspired by @entity14 singer @entity85 's struggle to get to the top as a mixed race artist , exemplified in her film @entity89 , in which she plays a young singer battling discrimination to make it to the top			2
she says she is ' @entity19 through and through			2
i am @entity19 - 100 percent ' @entity7 will represent @entity19 at @entity23 having fought her way to the top despite racial prejudice the beauty queen grew up in @entity12 near @entity13 but spent two years with her dad in the @entity14 as a teenager from his home in @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity7 's father @entity27 , 43 , said his face hurt from non-stop smiling since his daughter scooped the @entity1 award from a line up of more ' typical ' looking @entity19 women earlier this month			1
but he admits he 's been dismayed by some of the racist comments her win has generated in @entity19			2
' just get to know her			0
just do n't attack her			0
she will represent @entity19 very well , ' he told @entity55			2
' she 's told me all about the bullying and how kids used to treat her ; how they hated her ( wavy ) hair ; threw things at her ; even threw trash at her			0
' all pretty despicable stuff			0
but i always told her , and her @entity126 said too , ' you got ta be tough '			0
' divided from the @entity129 and @entity130 land masses by fierce currents , many @entity19 have long believed in a myth of racial purity , although the islands ' inhabitants are a result of a hodge - podge of different migrations mainly from @entity139 , @entity140 and the south seas			1
the only ' native @entity19 ' are the @entity144 - looking @entity143 people , pushed to near - extinction to @entity19 's northernmost reaches			1
today , those perceived of belonging outside the mythical @entity19 race are regularly discriminated against leading to a type of apartheid , particularly when it comes to renting housing			2
a recent ruling by @entity19 's ministry of justice in @entity155 declared that a ' no foreigners allowed ' rule by landlords is not in fact discriminatory , thus cementing some of the institutional and casual racism @entity161 face in contemporary @entity19			2
the @entity19 like to think of their society and culture is unique according to @entity166 , a professor of anthropology and @entity19 studies at @entity169 which , in a study , put @entity139 and @entity19 at the top of racially homogeneous countries , largely unwilling to accept an influx of foreigners			2
miss @entity19 has said there was ' pretty much a spasmodic vomit of racial abuse heaped upon me ' growing up @entity7 with her @entity19 mother and a male friend			1
she claims she was called a ' n * * * * r ' by her peers the @entity23 hopeful with a step sibling			0
her father says she is ' proud of both ' her heritages ' one of the ways in which @entity19 think of their own society as ' unique ' is to emphasise the homogeneity of @entity19 society and indeed by lots of comparisons , @entity19 is certainly a much more homogeneous society than say the @entity14 , ' @entity166 told @entity197 's @entity196			1
' and , it 's often said by @entity19 that they are ethnically homogeneous , that there are no real foreign populations in @entity19			2
' the election of a mixed race @entity19 is a first for one of the world 's most ethnically homogeneous states the election of a black miss @entity19 might be a step away from that misconception and mr @entity27 agrees that the choice of his daughter represents some kind of progression in @entity19			1
conversely , he feels his dark - skinned daughter would fair better in today 's @entity14 despite some recent headlines created by racial strife in @entity215			0
' it 's different in @entity14			0
her being what and who she is ; there is not a second thought , ' he said			0
in reaction to the racist carping on @entity19 's social networks since her crowning , he believes some of the received wisdom about ' @entity227 ' might be at fault			2
' some people , for a lack of a better word , some people are ignorant			0
i 'm not saying that the whole of @entity19 is ignorant but there some people who just do n't know , ' he said , adding that in his three years in @entity19 he personally had never experienced any racism			2
it was an encouraging sign that the @entity19 judges picked a mixed race @entity1 , he agreed , showing the progressive aspects of a country that still has the death penalty and where one tourism minister described his own ' one - race ' countrymen as ' not keen ' on immigration or foreigners			1
in contrast , mr @entity27 said , in terms of race relations the @entity14 is a much more rosy place than it once was			2
' things are changing here , ' he said , and agreed that the spread of more liberal attitudes towards gay marriage was just one example of how @entity14 is more enlightened and ' changing for the better			0
' ' its not a rapid change but slowly but surely it 's coming around			0
' ' i have to say what my daughter went through in @entity19 she would not have experienced in the @entity14			0
there are always some people here who do n't like you because of the way you look or because you are different so i 'm proud of her sticking it out in @entity19 and doing what she did - becoming miss @entity19			1
' as a young man , miss @entity19 's father 's life reads like that of the @entity14 lead in @entity277 , where a handsome naval officer falls in love with a @entity19 geisha before finally leaving @entity19 and his @entity19 bride and their daughter behind			1
he met @entity7 's @entity19 mother while on duty in the @entity14 navy at @entity13 in the 90s			1
' we moved stateside for a little while but her mother actually wanted @entity7 to be born in @entity19 , ' he said			1
@entity7 's father @entity27 , 43 , says people in @entity292 will ' never be as proud of her as i am ' ' after that my duties meant i could n't be in @entity19 for any length of time and slowly her mother and i drifted apart			1
there 's no bad history			0
her mother and i just went our separate ways			0
' not until @entity7 was a teenager did she renew her bond with her father			1
after mr @entity27 remarried and had three more children , they were joined by @entity7 more permanently three years ago when @entity7 stayed in @entity104 for two years to learn @entity305 and attend @entity14 high school			1
@entity305 is not widely spoken in @entity19 despite herculean education efforts to teach it			0
after returning from the @entity14 , @entity7 started a career in modelling in @entity19			1
it is a pastime often considered too ' showbiz ' by a traditionally - minded country , and one where beautiful half - @entity19 ' hafu ' offspring dominate			1
@entity7 's father is in little doubt she is proud of both heritages			1
' she 's fully aware of who she is and she 's fully aware of where she comes from			0
' she 's aware of both sides - the black side and the @entity19 side , ' he said			1
' she just wants everyone to get along and accept one another for what they are not because of the colour of their skin , but for who they are as a person			0
' please tell @entity19 to just accept her , and just be be proud of her			1
though i know they will never be as proud of her as i am			0

@entity7 was born and raised in @entity19 and speaks fluent @entity19
but 20 - year - old found it tough growing up as only black girl in her class
was raised in @entity12 near @entity13 where @entity19 mum met her father
has faced hostility for not being a ' pure @entity19 ' beauty pageant winner
father @entity27 says @entity19 will ' never be as proud of her as i am '
