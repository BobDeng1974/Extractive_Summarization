flavored milk must be nonfat , and there 's a ban on trans fat there will be more whole grains on school lunch menus this year , along with a wider selection of fruits and vegetables and other healthy options			1
the challenge is getting children to eat them			0
' we do n't want healthy trash cans			2
we want kids who are eating this stuff , ' said @entity17 , a former @entity18 restaurant manager who now works in school nutrition at @entity20 in @entity21			1
at a @entity24 conference in @entity25 this summer , food workers heard tips about how to get children to make healthy food choices in the cafeteria			2
the problem is a serious one for the nation 's lunch - line managers , who are implementing the biggest update to federal school - food guidelines in 15 years			1
new @entity36 guidelines taking effect this fall set calorie and sodium limits for school meals			1
first lady @entity41 , see today at the @entity42 at a ' state dinner ' lunch for children , has pushed for healthier eating and more exercise for children with her let 's move campaign food workers in @entity25 this summer heard tips about how to get children to make healthy food choices in the cafeteria and tasted samples in advance of new guidelines schools must offer dark green , orange or red vegetables and legumes at least once a week , and students are required to select at least one vegetable or fruit per meal			1
flavored milk must be nonfat , and there 's a ban on artificial , artery - clogging trans fats			1
the guidelines were announced as the @entity70 hosted the first ever @entity42 ' kids ' state dinner ' celebrating the young winners of a national healthy recipe contest - the latest effort in mrs @entity41 ’s ' @entity77 ' campaign to combat childhood obesity			1
top junior chefs presented their culinary masterpieces to the president and first lady while @entity83 demonstrated some healthy recipes for curious cafeteria managers , joining @entity42 chef @entity86 to prepare a veggie wrap using a whole - wheat tortilla			1
@entity83 ' main mission , though , was not pushing new recipes but teaching cafeteria managers marketing strategies used to great success by private - sector restaurants and food producers			0
the first step , cafeteria workers were told , is to stop thinking of lunchtime as a break from academics , but a crucial part of a child 's school day			1
it 's a wrap ! former @entity18 restaurant manager @entity17 shows how it 's done @entity106 and @entity41 hosted the first ever ' @entity107 ' at the @entity42 in @entity108 on monday which honored young winners of a national healthy recipe contest ' your job is not to serve kids food			1
your job is motivate kids to be adventurous and healthy eaters , ' said @entity116 , head of nutrition services at schools in @entity119 , @entity120			1
her school district recruited parent volunteers to be elementary - school ' food coaches ' , touring cafeterias and handing out samples of fruits and vegetables			2
persuasive : @entity130 has come up with some creative ways to get kids to eat their vegetables the food coaches would also demonstrate eating them			2
food coaching may seem silly , but kids who have had chicken only as nuggets or patties may not know how to eat bone - in chicken and need to see how a grown - up eats it before trying it themselves			2
as the kids graduate to middle and high schools , and grown - ups in the cafeteria are n't as welcome , schools can tap student ambassadors to be food coaches , perhaps asking the baseball team or a popular student athlete dish out veggies			2
or high school seniors might give underclassmen samples of a new vegetable coming to the cafeteria			1
school cafeterias also are using cutting - edge market research			2
they 're filming what kids eat , test - marketing new products before they go on the line and doing menu surveys to find out exactly what students think about a dish 's taste , appearance and temperature			1
a @entity176 professor studied the dining habits of kids in @entity179 , @entity180 , with an eye toward measuring ways to get them to choose healthier foods			2
@entity130 , who photographed ' before ' and ' after ' pictures of kids ' lunch trays , found that kids eat more fruits and vegetables if they have lunch after recess , instead of before recess			2
she found that corn consumption went up when generic ' corn ' labels were replaced with colorful cards describing the vegetable as ' mellow yellow corn '			2
' do n't put veggies in opaque containers or give them boring labels like " corn " , ' @entity130 told the lunch workers , showing diagrams of how to lay out a service line to encourage trips to the salad bar			0
another trick — just like supermarkets place impulse buys like candy and chewing gum by the checkout , lunch lines should place easy - to - grab fruits and veggies by their own cash registers			0
the ' kids ' state dinner ' was the latest effort in mrs @entity41 's ' @entity77 ' campaign to combat childhood obesity @entity222 - struck : president @entity41 greets a boy at the ' kids ' state dinner ' her study saw cafeterias double their sales of fresh fruit when they placed it colorful bowls in a convenient place			1
' you really have to be in their face with what 's available , ' @entity130 said			2
the marketing does n't stop at the cafeteria doors			0
@entity238 in @entity239 , @entity240 , got children to eat more fruits and vegetables when cafeteria manager @entity244 started a recess snack cart bringing the foods straight to the playground for kids to munch on			0
her school also bought an @entity250 2 to raffle away to students who entered by choosing a healthy breakfast yogurt parfait and turning in tickets attached to the bottom			1
she tempted kids to try unusual flavors by giving out ' @entity257 ' including unexpected ingredients such as spinach			0
@entity244 said schools can be persuaded to invest more in nutrition promotions because the payoff is better students			0
healthy delicacies were on offer at the ' kids state dinner ' including the @entity268 and @entity269 ( left ) and @entity270 with @entity271 ( right ) ' we get a lot of feedback from teachers that behavior problems are way down because the kids are eating right , ' @entity244 said			1
educators are coming around to recognizing value in having better school food , @entity116 told the cafeteria workers			0
' food is one of the most important influences on your everyday brain cells , ' @entity116 said			0
healthy eating habits , she argued , is as important as everything else schools are trying to teach			0
' we have to change , ' @entity116 said			0
' we have to build an environment that creates excitement about what we are doing rather than fear of new foods			0
