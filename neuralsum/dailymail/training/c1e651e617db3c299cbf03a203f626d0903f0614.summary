it is a friday night at @entity1 in @entity2			0
@entity3 has just watched @entity4 dismantle @entity5 6 - 0			1
he makes straight for coach @entity6			0
‘ tell me more about the winger , @entity7 , ’ he demands			1
@entity3 , though , has already seen enough			1
he is considering an invite to train with the senior squad , as he is with a number of the @entity10			1
for what the @entity4 boss has just witnessed , a goal and man - of - the - match display on his international debut , is what many on @entity16 have been whispering about for a while — @entity7 , the boy from @entity19 with a turn of foot like @entity22 and all the trickery of @entity24			1
@entity7 scores after seven minutes to set @entity25 on their way to shock win at @entity28 the chance to join @entity30 and @entity31 at @entity32 , however , never materialises due to a hamstring injury			1
but his name has been pencilled in			0
on wednesday night , as he terrorised a @entity28 backline worth in excess of £ 40million , pencil turned to ink			1
it was he , on his return from that injury , who opened the scoring after just seven minutes to set @entity25 on their way to a shock 2 - 0 victory and in to the last eight of the @entity51			1
on saturday , the 18 - year - old could make his first @entity54 start against @entity55			0
residing in the opposition team will be @entity57 , 11 months his senior			2
@entity57 was also born in @entity19 ’s capital , @entity59 , before moving to the @entity60 at a young age			0
comparison , therefore , is inevitable , not that @entity7 invites such parallels			2
@entity7 terrorised a @entity28 backline worth in excess of £ 40million on wednesday night ‘ i ’m not @entity57 – and @entity57 is not me , ’ returns the sure - headed youngster , seemingly determined to forge his own path in the game			1
‘ @entity57 has played really well for the last two or three seasons and i ’ m nowhere near that level yet			0
i do n’t want people to compare us , although he ’s obviously a player that i admire			0
’ comparisons ? no. how about a shirt swap ? ‘ hopefully i ’ll get the chance to play in the same game as him , and if that happens i might ask for his shirt			2
why not ? he ’s a good player , ’ he says , before guarding against the mistake of @entity78			0
‘ whatever happens , i definitely wo n’t be swapping at half - time though ! ’ @entity7 continues : ‘ but i ’ve got a long way to go before i can even consider myself to be anywhere like ( @entity90 )			2
he ’s played for @entity4 at the @entity92 , and i ’ve only played three or four games for @entity25			1
i do n’t think there ’s any reason to get carried away			0
’ @entity25 manager @entity96 congratulates @entity7 after @entity51 success the fact is , when the @entity4 manager is smitten after marvelling at 79 minutes on a non-league pitch at a remote @entity103 outpost , there is reason to get a little bit excited			1
‘ i ’m aware of people talking , but it does n’t really bother me , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’m just focusing on playing football , and what other people are saying about me , or the praise that i ’ve been getting , does n’t really affect what i ’m doing			0
i know i can play much better than i have been			2
’ that last statement must sound as a warning for @entity25 ’s upcoming opponents , starting with a @entity55 defence terrified of pace and cunning , both of which @entity7 boasts			1
@entity7 caught the eye of @entity4 boss @entity3 with impressive display for the @entity121 @entity28 discovered that when he sprung clear of their trailing rearguard before slotting through the legs of @entity124			1
he made way at the break – ‘ knackered ’ , he later explained – but perhaps @entity96 was saving @entity127 to unleash on the out - of - form @entity128			0
for his @entity25 manager , like @entity3 , is rather taken with the teen			1
‘ he has a nice temperament , ’ says @entity96 of the player who arrived at the club from @entity133 as a 15 - year - old			0
‘ i think he had some troubles at @entity133 , but i really like him as a person			0
he has got his feet on the ground , he has got tremendous potential and this could be a breakthrough season for him			0
’ teenager @entity7 has drawn inevitable comparisons with @entity55 's @entity57 @entity96 read an article on @entity144 earlier this week which suggested , according to data , that @entity148 ’s @entity147 is the quickest player in the top flight , prompting him to say : ‘ i saw that @entity147 is apparently the quickest in the @entity54			1
‘ well , i would bet @entity7 and @entity150 against him any day of the week			2
his ( @entity152 ) massive asset is his pace			0
’ @entity7 , having already won admirers from the very top of the @entity157 game , certainly is n’t hanging about .			2

@entity3 saw @entity7 play starring role for @entity4 under *20s*
@entity162 was set to train with @entity4 's senior squad before suffering injury
the @entity25 winger scored on his comeback against @entity28
