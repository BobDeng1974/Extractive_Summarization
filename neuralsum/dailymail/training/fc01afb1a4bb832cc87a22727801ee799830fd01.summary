a charity worker drowned in a 3ft deep lake when a policeman and a paramedic were ordered not to try to rescue him			1

tragedy : @entity4 , right , feeds the swans at the lake in @entity14 , @entity15 , where he drowned a few months after this picture was taken ' too deep ' : emergency services are pictured here just after they recovered the body from the lake			1
they had refused to get into the water until specialists arrived because it was ' too deep ' according to a doctor , mr @entity4 ’s life could have been saved had he been removed from the water quickly			1
the constable and the ambulance worker who volunteered to jump into the lake were given strict orders not to do so by fire station watch manager @entity31			0
@entity33 @entity32 arrived at the scene on foot shortly after mr @entity4 fell into the water while feeding swans			1
he told the inquest : ‘ when i spoke to witnesses and found out the body had n’t been there long i told my sergeant i was willing to go into the water			1

mr @entity31 , who is based at @entity14 fire station , told the inquest that he understood the body had been in the water for five to ten minutes			1
‘ there were no obvious signs of life so from that i made an assessment it was a body retrieval and not a rescue , ’ he said			0
‘ the officers were trained to go into ankle deep water , which is level one , so we waited for level two officers , who can go into chest high			1
‘ one of the police officers told me he would like to go in the water and i advised him in the strongest terms not to			1
a paramedic told me he was level two water trained , but when i asked him if he had protective equipment he said “ no ” , so that was the end of that			2
