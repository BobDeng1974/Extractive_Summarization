@entity0 could form a tactical alliance with the @entity2 or @entity3 if the party wins a string of seats at the next election			1
@entity8 signalled the possibility of a new ‘ confidence and supply ’ policy instead of a coalition deal			1
under such an agreement , his party would back key measures such as the @entity17 , but would not hold ministerial posts			1
asked yesterday whether he would join a coalition , the @entity0 leader said there were ‘ other ways ’ of doing it			1
@entity8 has signalled that his party could back a ' confidence and supply ' arrangement in the event of a hung parliament next year - agreeing to back key policies but voting freely on everything else ‘ i do n’t honestly think that has to be done just because the @entity31 did that , ’ he added			1
‘ there are other ways you can support a minority government in motions of confidence or supporting some of the key bills			1
there are ways of doing it			2
‘ do i think we ’ve got momentum behind us ? do i think we are picking up support across the board and do i think there ’s a possibility that in may we will find ourselves in a position of a hung parliament where we have serious influence on the @entity51 ? well , yes , that ’s a possibility ’			2
mr @entity8 was given tacit support from @entity53 , who will sit in the @entity54 as the sole @entity0 mp from monday			1
@entity53 has distanced himself from @entity8 ’s ( pictured ) controversial remarks about foreigners – insisting he has ‘ no difficulty with @entity59 as it is today ’			2
in his victory speech , mr @entity53 declined to endorse some of his leader ’s views and revealed he had sought assurances that the party was not racist			2
mr @entity8 told his party ’s spring conference this year that parts of @entity59 were like a foreign land and claimed he felt uncomfortable when he heard only foreign accents on the train			2
the comments plunged him into his biggest political storm			2
after holding his @entity74 seat by a landslide , mr @entity53 urged his colleagues to show ‘ compassion as well as passion ’ and to be welcoming to first and second - generation migrants			2
mr @entity53 , who supports securing @entity59 ’s borders from illegal migrants , but believes that immigration is beneficial , tried to claim mr @entity8 had been misunderstood			2
as to whether he agreed with his view , mr @entity53 said : ‘ i have no difficulty with @entity59 as @entity59 is today			0
’ but he admitted @entity0 ’s views on race were his biggest concern about joining			1
‘ i would never have joined a racist party ’ , he said			0
mr @entity53 ’s advice for his new party was : ‘ humility when we win			0
modesty when we are proved right			0
if we speak with passion let it be tempered with compassion			0
’ he added : ‘ let us be a party for all @entity59 – and all @entity59 , first and second generation as much as any other			0
’ and he insisted he and mr @entity8 saw eye to eye on most issues			0
‘ sometimes , the things that people say in politics … are misrepresented in a way that does n’t actually reflect what was meant			0
’ the newly elected mp for @entity74 said he expected to back a @entity104 to recall errant members – one of his pet projects – when it is presented by @entity108 mp @entity107			2
mr @entity53 said he may support @entity109 next april if it contained sensible measures to build on the economic recovery			2
but he said he would also back ‘ good ideas ’ from @entity3 and the @entity31 , adding : ‘ i ca n’t afford to be tribal now			1
’ mr @entity8 downplayed remarks he made in a magazine interview claiming he would like to be @entity116 in a future coalition , saying ‘ i do n’t think they would have me			0
’ but a confidence and supply deal is becoming a real possibility because the polls indicate that neither @entity3 nor the @entity108 will win a majority next may and the largest party may choose to govern alone			1
@entity0 feels it has little to gain from coalition when it can criticise both parties from the sidelines			1
many conservatives also reject the idea , saying voters would see it as a ‘ stitch - up ’			0
confidence and supply deals are struck when the largest party does not win the 326 seats required for a majority in the @entity51 – or if it loses its majority because of defections or by - elections			0
the arrangement effectively means backing the bigger party in no - confidence votes ( ‘ confidence ’ ) and allowing it to pass laws to raise money ( ‘ supply ’ ) for their policies			0
but in reality @entity0 would demand concessions – while still allowing their mps to speak their minds rather than having to support the government			1
such an agreement took place in the ‘ @entity156 ’ of 1977 , when @entity158 ’s @entity3 government took power with a majority of just three seats but then lost mps to by - elections			1
he asked @entity165 for 13 @entity31 mps to vote with the government in exchange for accepting their proposals			2
however , the deal lasted just 15 months			2
faced with the same situation in 2010 , the @entity31 instead opted for a full @entity172 under which mps hold ministerial posts			1
@entity175 , the @entity176 , wrote yesterday : ‘ [ voters ] are clearly tired of the @entity179 games played out , the perception that in @entity179 politicians make deals to help themselves and not the public			0
‘ that ’s why i do n’t believe making an electoral pact with @entity0 – as some in my party have called for – is right			1
‘ another @entity179 stitch - up is not the answer to an electorate that wants to make a choice			0
’ @entity193 , the @entity194 @entity108 mp for @entity195 , said yesterday ’s by - election results in @entity197 and the northern seat of @entity199 made the need for electoral pacts with @entity0 all the more urgent			1
‘ we need to lock @entity203 and @entity8 up in a room together until they come up with a solution ’ , he said			0
newly elected mp @entity53 ( pictured with mr @entity8 today ) has said he may support @entity109 's budget next april , but is open to ' good ' suggestions from @entity3 and the @entity31 ‘ one way would be @entity0 candidates supporting mps locally who want to leave @entity213 , whether that is @entity2 or @entity3 people , they could endorse them			1
‘ at the end of the day , if the @entity2 and @entity0 had run together in both @entity74 and @entity199 on a centre - right ticket they would have won			1
‘ and it would be enormously disappointing if @entity3 get in next year with 33 per cent of the vote because we have split the vote between us			1
’ he dismissed the idea that the conservatives and @entity0 no longer have similar policies			1
‘ they are for coming out of @entity213 , against mass immigration and the folly of wind farms – these are views shared by conservatives across the country			0
’ the @entity2 , who may fall short of a majority but remain the largest party next year , have discussed confidence and supply with the @entity239 – which has eight mps – if it takes the conservatives over the finishing line			1
one significant factor in @entity74 was a recent savagely anti-ukip column in the @entity245 by the gay @entity247 mp @entity246 – a brilliant writer who is very much on the liberal wing of the party			0
here , we publish an abridged version of an article that was considered so damaging to the @entity108 cause that @entity0 reproduced it in its @entity74 campaign literature			1
now @entity8 ’s supporters are offering to fund visits by mr @entity246 to the party ’s other target seats			0
do n’t buy the too - easy media picture of a rancid or untended town , or of bitter people ; but understand that @entity74 is going nowhere			0
its voters are going nowhere , it ’s rather sad , and there ’s nothing more to say			0
this is @entity59 on crutches			0
this is tracksuit - and - trainers @entity59 , tattoo - parlour @entity59 , all - our - yesterdays @entity59			0
so of course @entity0 will do well in the by - election			1
my aim , though , is not to deny @entity0 its likelihood of victory			1
they make a good fit for @entity74			0
somebody has to represent the static caravans and holiday villages , and the people and places that for no fault of their own are not getting where a 21st century @entity59 needs to be going			0
@entity246 ' column was considered so harmful to @entity108 chances in @entity74 that @entity0 supporters are now offering to pay for visits by him to other target seats nor do i deny that we conservatives , if we tried hard enough , could get some of these voters back			1
there are many in a place like this who might be attracted again to the @entity2 by a noisy display of hostility towards immigration - and - @entity213 , political correctness and health - and - safety : hostility to a @entity59 that has forgotten the joys of @entity307 , meat pies , smoking in pubs and the @entity310			1
no , my aim is to ask this : is that where the @entity108 wants to be ? is it where the @entity2 need to be if they ’re to gather momentum in this century , rather than slowly lose it ? or do we need to be with the @entity59 that has its career prospects ahead and not behind , that can admire immigrants and want them with us , that does n’t want to spend its days buying scratchcards and its evenings smoking in pubs , that ’s amazed at all the fuss about whether gays should marry , that travels in @entity213 and would hesitate to let those links go ? i am not arguing that we should be careless of the needs of struggling people and places such as @entity74			1
but i am arguing – if i am honest – that we should be careless of their opinions			0
some of the @entity330 want to ... invest our political future in the disappointed , the angry , the nostalgic and the fearful			0
this is not a crazy strategy , because the market in pessimism is easy to capture , and easier to hold on to than the market in optimism ; there will always be millions of pessimists			2
but the truth from which the @entity330 hides is this : you can not look like a party for the resentful and still appeal to the cheerful			0
if you want to win @entity344 you may have to let go of @entity74			0
from the train leaving @entity346 for @entity74 , you can see @entity347 , humming with a sense of the possible			0
you must turn your back on that if you want to go to @entity74			2
i do n’t , and the @entity2 should n’t .			1

@entity0 could support @entity3 or @entity2 from sidelines after 2015 election
deal would see them back key *legislation* but vote freely on everything else
@entity0 @entity360 would not hold ministerial posts but could demand concessions
