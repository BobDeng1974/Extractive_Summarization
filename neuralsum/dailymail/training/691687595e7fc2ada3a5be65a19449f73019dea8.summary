@entity0 - better known as the prison in the @entity3 - nominated @entity2 - is to be transformed into a major tourist attraction			1
the @entity5 built in 1886 , which narrowly escaped demolition recently , has now been earmarked for a massive makeover			0
over the next six months the building will be cleaned , redecorated , and have its huge cathedral - style windows replaced as well as having heating installed in a bid to increase tourism			1
most of the grounds and support buildings , including the outer wall , were demolished after it closed , but destroying the gigantic structure with its 25 - foot high , six - foot thick walls , proved problematic and it remained			0
the @entity37 , which bought the site for a dollar in 1995 , has been the focal point of the tourism drive			0
the society turned the former prison into a museum and began conducting tours to help fund its renovation			1
the building attracted 80,000 visitors last year alone - and brought in £ 6m ( $ 10m ) in revenue , but tourism officials believe this figure can be boosted considerably with the right enhancements			1
@entity54 photograph of a cell in the @entity0 which was officially opened in september 1896 a multitude of scenes were filmed in the vicinity of the @entity0 and now fans can visit the site the society has already raised more than £ 1.2m ( $ 2m ) which was used to repair the reformatory roof , and its new plans include heating some sections of the reformatory which have not been heated for decades , and opening up additional areas to the public			1
stained glass windows which were vandalised have also been removed for repair			2
a significant boost in tourism will safeguard the future of the @entity5 for generations to come say its supporters			0
last week thousands of @entity77 fans gathered at the reformatory in @entity79 , @entity0 , to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the film which has now achieved cult status			1
celebrations included re-enactments of scenes from the film while the renovated guard room played host to a 1940s themed cocktail party			2
@entity89 played the character of @entity91 in the much loved film which has increased visitors to @entity79 the inmates of the fictional @entity96 work outside @entity0 during filming the @entity2 was a slow burner to begin with			1
@entity98 in 1993 , it received encouraging reviews from critics but failed to attract large audiences			0
in fact the @entity102 said the film earned a meagre £ 2.6m at @entity106 cinemas and only just covered its costs from @entity109 box office sales			2
but once released on home video and later on dvd the film captured the imagination of movie fans worldwide			2
earlier this year it was named by renowned film magazine empire as the fourth best movie of all time			0
tourists and fans became increasingly keen to visit the historic building in @entity79 as a result of the film 's growing success , and the building was given a new lease of life			1
the @entity2 bus tour includes a visit to some of the film 's most renowned locations			1
@entity77 fans can visit the @entity135 building where @entity137 ( @entity136 ) hanged himself and @entity91 decided to ' get busy living ' , and see the bench where @entity137 fed his birds			0
visitors to the building in @entity79 , @entity0 can see the bench where @entity137 ( @entity136 ) fed the birds @entity15 ( @entity2 ) shares a scene with @entity89 ( @entity91 ) outside the reformatory other recognisable locations include the remains of the old oak tree where @entity149 hid money for @entity91 and @entity151 where @entity149 followed his cheating wife			1
the @entity37 has worked hard on marketing the reformatory in recent years and has put on events including a huge @entity155 festival , extreme ghost hunts and murder mystery dinners			2
thousands of people have come to pay homage to what many people believe is one of the greatest films of all time and the legacy of the @entity3 nominated movie should ensure that visitors continue to flock to @entity79 for years to come			0
however , tourists seeking the authentic ' @entity77 ' experience should be careful to ensure cell doors do n't close behind them			0
' we do n’t have keys for some of these , ' one of the tour guides revealed			0
' they might be in there until the next day			0
