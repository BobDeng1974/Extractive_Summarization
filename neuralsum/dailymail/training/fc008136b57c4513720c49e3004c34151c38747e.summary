@entity0 runs you through what we learned from the weekend 's football ... with some star turns and a look through the leagues , too			2
this week sees a @entity9 midfielder and new @entity11 signing stealing the headlines 1			1
@entity13 has made a big breakthrough in @entity16 ’s thinking after being named to start against both @entity17 and @entity18			1
the @entity20 midfielder made just 10 @entity21 starts last season and not one was against a top four team , but @entity9 ’s manager is clearly ready to put more trust in the 28 - year - old			1
he justified his new status , playing in three different positions as @entity9 adjusted to having ten men before he then provided the pass for @entity34 ’s late equaliser			1
@entity13 celebrates setting up @entity34 for the equaliser against @entity18 2			1
@entity37 ’s arrival at @entity11 will give @entity38 a new lease of life to play a more attacking role in @entity43 ’s plans			1
one club man @entity38 has been anchored in a defensive midfield position for some time , but having @entity37 behind him meant 24 of the 34 accurate passes he played against @entity48 were in the attacking half			1
he made the switch count – making one goal and setting up three more chances in the 3 - 1 win over @entity55 ’ team			0
@entity56 loanee @entity37 was an imposing presence for @entity11 against @entity48 3			1
with a capacity of just 18,360 @entity59 already have the disadvantage of the smallest stadium in the @entity21 – so it must be an additional worry that they ca n’t fill it			1
just 16,163 saw @entity66 ’s free kick rescue a 2 - 2 draw – and even allowing that @entity68 brought only 1,028 fans to go in the 1,900 capacity away end that still leaves 1,325 home seats unsold			0
full price tickets started at £ 30 – but were trading for as little as £ 17 on the club ’s official viagogo site			1
@entity59 players celebrate stealing a point against @entity68 in front of a less than full @entity79 4			1
@entity80 has mostly been a bit part player for @entity17 this season – he ’s appeared in all nine games but the win at @entity85 was only the second time he ’s started a @entity21 game			1
the 78 minutes he completed before getting subbed was the most he ’s played in the league since last march but there were signs he could be pushing for more			0
his neat touch started the move from which @entity93 got the @entity94 ’ first goal , and he found a team mate with 46 of his 55 passes			2
pressure from @entity80 forced an own goal versus @entity85 in a rare start for the midfielder 5			0
@entity102 moaned about not getting more chance to play in central midfield at @entity11 and has done his best to make his point since joining @entity106			1
the @entity109 international ’s brilliant finish at @entity110 proved he ’s got a shot in both feet – with a left foot rocket following up his right foot finish against the @entity11 last monday			1
maybe if he ’d shown more of that quality at @entity116 last season he ’d have got more opportunities to play in his favourite role – he got just four goals in the entire campaign			1
@entity102 has scored two in two since joining @entity106 from @entity11 6			1
@entity122 got the headlines for the two goals that rescued @entity125 from another calamity but the player who worked his socks off most to save the boss was midfielder @entity130			0
the free transfer capture from neighbours @entity132 , hailed by @entity133 as the ' ginger @entity134 ' when he was picked for the @entity20 squad , covered 7.8 miles against @entity106 – the furthest run by any @entity21 player on saturday			2
he gave quality as well as quantity – with a 95.3 per cent passing success rate			0
free transfer @entity130 ( left ) looks set to be a key player for @entity110 7			0
@entity145 was always a bit old school at @entity147 when it came to using a minimum of substitutes – and his former number two @entity150 has picked up some of the same habits			0
@entity152 , feeling his way into his first job as a @entity21 boss at @entity156 , stuck with his starting line - up at @entity158 right the way through to the 89th minute when he swapped @entity160 for @entity161 to waste a bit of time to hang on to			0
every other top flight side sent on three subs this weekend – apart from @entity68 and @entity166 who both used two			0
it was a first @entity21 win for @entity156 manager @entity150 8			2
@entity170 ’s decision to trust his former @entity172 assistant @entity171 with the development of young striker @entity174 looks like paying dividends			0
the 21 - year - old , who got 25 goals in 53 games on loan for @entity180 and @entity181 last season , marked his full @entity184 debut by scoring in the 4 - 0 demolition of @entity186			2
@entity20 under 21 striker @entity174 is due back at @entity188 in january when @entity170 wants him to compete for a place in @entity18 ’s first team squad			2
@entity174 ( 23 ) rises highest to head his first @entity184 goal 9			0
@entity193 ’s first attempt to rebuild his management career after getting sacked by @entity85 was a disaster when he walked out of @entity196 after just 41 days – but his next go in @entity198 looks more promising			0
the former @entity200 boss is unbeaten in three games in charge of @entity203 and got his first win on saturday night when his side ended the 100 per cent home record of @entity207 with a 2 - 1 win			0
@entity209 might have been out of work for 19 months since getting rather harshly sacked by @entity211 but clearly has n’t forgotten how to deliver a half time team talk			0
the 50 - year - old former @entity20 defender , who has taken the tough job of bossing @entity215 in 92nd place in the @entity21 , watched his new club go 3 - 0 down by the break against promotion hopefuls @entity220			2
a few well chosen words inspired a fight back that got them within a whisker of rescuing a point at 3 - 2			0
' i just said i wanted to see if they could come back in at the end , look me in the eye , and tell me they ’d had a go , ' @entity209 explained			0
it 's been a long wait for new @entity215 boss @entity209 to return to the touchline			2

@entity13 has started against @entity17 and @entity18 this season , showing greater faith from @entity9 manager @entity16
@entity37 's arrival at @entity11 will give @entity38 an opportunity to play a more attacking role
@entity59 will suffer from being unable to sell out @entity79
@entity102 showed his finishing *ability* in a central role for new club @entity106
