a razor brand is trying to dispel the ' sexy beard ' myth with ads showing rodents clinging to men 's faces however further inspection reveals their beards to in fact be curled up creatures , complete with unbelievably realistic little faces			1
@entity31 curled round the jawline , or clinging to the rather stoic looking men 's chins , the animals have been carefully created from their own facial hair			2
attempting to convince hipsters to prevent their beloved beards from going feral , razor brand @entity39 have also launched a competition			1

the label is attempting to convince hipsters to prevent their beloved beards from going feral a recent study revealed women found the same man more attractive with a 10 - day beard than clean - shaven , so perhaps a little beard is ok as long as it 's maintained and kept form going haywire			2
while this may be an amusing and attention grabbing concept for an advert , we dread to think of scores of @entity65 taking a razor to their beard in an attempt to imitate this ultimate ' alternative ' facial hair style			0
further inspection reveals their beards to in fact be curled up creatures , with unbelievably realistic little faces			0
