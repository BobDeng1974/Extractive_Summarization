‘ the thing got out of control under the last @entity23 government and this government is doing its best to try to regain the borders			0
but i think that students are really not what people perceive as immigrants			1
' the @entity7 peer added : ' you have got two huge assets : one is the prestige of @entity11 's universities and the ambassadorial role which students who graduate here take with them out into the world wherever they go after graduation			0
‘ and then you have got the huge financial stability that foreign students bring to the universities in this country , enabling them to maintain their standards of excellence			1
’ but migration watch @entity69 's chairman sir @entity68 said : ‘ nobody is against genuine students who return home but @entity2 has not realised that only one third of @entity76 students actually do so			1

international students are the largest group of migrants from outside the @entity111 counted in the government 's immigration figures			2
