by @entity0 published : 17:31 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 03:55 est , 6 february 2013 even to a baby elephant , he surely ca n’t look much like mother			1
but to a young orphan called @entity6 , this 29 - year - old nature reserve keeper has become the next best thing			1
the three - month - old pygmy elephant was pictured last week nuzzling his lifeless mother in a desperate attempt to revive her			1
the mother had become the latest victim of a mysterious spate of poisoning in the tropical rainforest of @entity24 , one of 14 now known to have died			1
had @entity6 not been rescued he would almost certainly have stayed at his mother ’s side until he starved to death			1
frightened , thirsty and confused , he had lost weight and might have ingested poison through his mother ’s milk			2
despite 24 - hour care in the nature reserve now looking after him , experts feared @entity6 could still die of a broken heart			1
getting to know you : @entity6 and his keeper indulge in a bit of horseplay now that they have formed a remarkable bond @entity43 time : @entity6 's new keeper @entity44 seems to be enjoying it , but the elephant is n't so keen			1
@entity44 said of the elephant that he ' has clear likes and dislikes ' feeding : keepers have found a special formula of milk which caters to @entity6 's nutritional needs then he was introduced to @entity53			1
now , in a remarkable bond between man and beast , the keeper has become @entity6 ’s surrogate mum			1
like any parent , @entity44 faces a gruelling schedule that requires feeding @entity6 every two hours , all through the night , with a particular mix of formula milk that the infant has a taste for			2
playtime involves him running @entity6 around the compound at @entity68 zoo near @entity69 , which the little elephant loves ; and persuading him to keep still for bathtime , which he loathes			1
‘ he has clear likes and dislikes , ’ @entity44 said			0
‘ he loves suckling people ’s thumbs - just like a human baby , it calms him			0
but he does n’t like showers , so we have to wash him in his pen			0
at the moment he is losing his baby skin so he likes to rub against anything because he ’s itchy			0
' @entity84 : the keeper and the inmate have formed an unusually close relationship at the wildlife centre friendly : so far , @entity6 seems to be adapting fairly well to life among humans after his mother 's death danger : but it is too soon to say for sure that the fun - loving elephant will survive his ordeal he also loves attention			1
and when it ’s not focused on him , he is not slow to let his adopted mother know			2
he kicks @entity44 in the legs or nudges up against him			0
‘ he ’s active , playful and naughty , ’ the keeper said proudly			0
in any other circumstances , this would be simply a delightful if rather bizarre partnership			0
at the moment , however , it is still a fight for life			0
dr @entity110 , the vet overseeing @entity6 ’s recovery , told the @entity112 : ‘ he is far from safety yet			2
it ’s too soon to be sure that he will make it – sometimes baby elephants can look ok and then die suddenly			2
‘ they are very prone to colic and it can be fatal very quickly			0
once he ’s past six or seven months , we can be more confident			0
but he clearly has a strong will to survive			0
’ chilling out : the elephant stretches in his new home as @entity44 looks on at his protegé surrogate mum : like any parent , @entity44 faces a gruelling schedule that requires feeding @entity6 every two hours , all through the night , with a particular mix of formula milk that the infant has a taste for about two - thirds of the world ’s diminishing population of @entity138 pygmy elephants can be found in @entity24			1
investigations are still being carried out to discover what wiped out the 14 adult elephants , and whether they were killed deliberately , by accidental contamination or infection			2
last week it was claimed that palm oil plantation workers were responsible for poisoning the animals			2
experts believe the elephants could have eaten toxic substances laid to keep away ‘ pests ’ from the highly lucrative crop			0
they live on land in the @entity153 which is very close to palm oil fields			0
mysterious spate of poisoning : @entity6 's mother is one of 14 known elephants to have died and investigations are still being carried out to discover what wiped them out and whether it was deliberate or accidental popular : the orphaned elephant has been a hit with handlers at the wildlife centre in @entity24 all the animals that died still had their tusks and none bore gunshot wounds , indicating that poachers were not responsible			1
the future ? if he pulls through , @entity6 is likely to stay at the 280 - acre park for the rest of his life – rescued elephants often have difficulty adapting to life in the wild			1
he wo n’t be lonely			0
an instant family – the reserve ’s 16 other injured and orphaned elephants – are waiting to be introduced .			0

@entity185 is providing 24 hour care for the pygmy elephant
@entity6 's mother was one of 14 elephants to die of mysterious poisoning
