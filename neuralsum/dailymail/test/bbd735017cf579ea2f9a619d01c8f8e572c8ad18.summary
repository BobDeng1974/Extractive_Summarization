the @entity0 have unveiled their new kits for the women 's soccer team ahead of the @entity3 hosted by @entity4 in june			1
the strips , produced by sportswear giants @entity6 , have caused a bit of stir across the pond , because of the decision to go with a black and white colour scheme rather than the traditional red , white and blue			1
but striker @entity12 hailed @entity6 's design as innovative			2
' the black and white are different from anything we 've ever had before , ' she said , before adding , ' you know it 's not a lot of red , white and blue in the white one because they wanted a clean look			1
i think it stands out in the fact that it is clean and just simple and i love that			0
' if you look at it traditionally , actually , all the home kits are always white			0
so we 're actually not changing the history			0
in face we are being authentic to the history where it 's always a white kit			0
' @entity6 have opted to put the focus of the new kit on the feet first and worked their way up			0
the neon yellow socks or ' volt ' in @entity6 parlance are aimed to draw attention to the bright blue cleats			2
' it 's the first time as well that ( the kit ) is fully integrated , so going from the boot right to the sock , then it fades from the volt into the white kit , ' @entity40 said , ' it 's a real head - to - toe look			0
' the @entity0 women 's team kick off their @entity3 campaign against @entity75 on june 8 with a group match in @entity77 , @entity78			1
some people have questioned the decision to abandon the @entity0 's traditional red , white and blue colours @entity0 player @entity29 poses with a mannequin at the launch of the new kit in @entity85 on wednesday			1
