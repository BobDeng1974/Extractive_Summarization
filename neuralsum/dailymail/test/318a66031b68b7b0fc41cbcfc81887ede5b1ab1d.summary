when @entity1 picture gallery began discussing the idea of introducing a fake painting to their collection , no - one could have imagined it would have led to the quadrupling of visitor numbers			1
but that is exactly what happened when @entity11 ’s 18th - century work @entity12 was replaced by a hand - painted replica , produced in @entity14 and ordered over the internet for £ 70			1
it has hung in among 270 @entity18 paintings since february 10 after a challenge was laid down to the public to ' spot the fake '			1
now , three months on , the gallery has revealed that only 10 per cent of the 3,000 people who visited during the experiment guessed correctly			1
he told @entity42 : ' it was a fascinating experiment which gave us a chance to test art connoisseurs and we saw visitor numbers quadruple because of it			1
' it made people look closely at a painting and discern what might be a replica and why			2
ten per cent got it right , which means @entity55 as a nation is still a nation of connoisseurs , which is great			0
' unfortunately others got it wrong			0
a number of visitors presumed the imposter was a female portrait by @entity40 , which had been restored 10 years ago , because it appeared brighter			0
but that was interesting as it allowed us to find out more about the way the public look at our paintings			1
' the idea for the exhibition , titled made in @entity14 , came from @entity76 artist @entity75			1
its aim was to make people think about the way they look at , appreciate and value artistic masterpieces			0
mr @entity34 said @entity1 was keen to challenge the public to ' spot the fake ' as a way of engaging with visitors and making the picture gallery more interactive			1
visitors were challenged to spot the replica among 270 @entity18 paintings			1
only 10 per cent of them guessed right			0
the original and fake are now hanging together , making the difference more obvious ' fascinating experiment ' : the gallery 's chief curator , @entity34 ( pictured ) , said visitor numbers quadrupled after the ' spot the fake ' challenge was laid down to the public at the beginning of february the power of the museum : mr @entity34 said the gallery was not planning any similar experiments			1
instead , his attention has turned to whether the fake will now become a work of art in its own right ' it was a risk , no doubt about it , ' he said			2
' you would n't expect the @entity114 or the @entity115 to display a replica on their walls but because we 're an independent charity and do n't rely on public money it means we 're relatively free to do what we want			1
' but that does n't mean there could n't have been repercussions			0
we are a temple of art and as soon as people cross that threshold they expect everything you are told on a label to be correct			0
' our aim was to get people to engage and learn - that is what was really exciting			2
can they spot a replica by comparing it with the magical , beautiful originals we have ? ' the way to distinguish the real from the fake , mr @entity34 said , was to look at the lack of warmth in the background canvas of the imposter and the modern pigment of acrylic paints			1
' if you look closely , the brushwork on the fake is trying to be expressive but it comes across as dead because it 's an attempt to replicate something else			2
there 's no magic to it like there is with the real one			0
' the original painting was put back in its frame yesterday and hung beside the replica , allowing people to compare the differences between the two			0
mr @entity34 said the gallery was not planning any similar experiments			0
instead , his attention has turned to whether the fake will now become a work of art in its own right			0
' it will be very interesting to see what happens when the counterfeit leaves the gallery , ' he said			2
' will it achieve significance and become a work of art ? ' this is where the power of it being displayed in a temple of a museum could give it extra significance in the art world - that is also part of the experiment			0
' original : @entity11 ’s @entity12 @entity11 ’s 18th - century work @entity12 is one of his famous @entity191 , a series of quickly executed studies intended to showcase the artist ’s virtuoso handling of oil paint			1
it was painted in 1769			0
the unidentified woman is portrayed in @entity200 dress , with a lace collar and slashed sleeves suggesting the dramatic costume of the stage			0
it was @entity200 painter @entity206 ( 1599 - 1660 ) who inspired the depiction of @entity200 dress in 18th - century @entity209 art. once thought to be by @entity209 artist @entity211 ( 1678 - 1733 ) on the strength of his signature , closer examination revealed that this was false			1
@entity11 's genuine signature , ‘ @entity216 ’ , is discernible above , although partially obscured by overpainting			2
it is believed @entity11 was paying a playful homage to @entity211 , a fellow artist who was well known in @entity209 at the time , particularly as a copyist it is thought @entity11 's intent was not to deceive , but rather to excite connoisseurs with amusing visual ambiguity .			2

counterfeit , ordered on internet from @entity14 for £ 70 , has now been revealed
