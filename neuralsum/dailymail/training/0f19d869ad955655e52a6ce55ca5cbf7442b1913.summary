by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 21:45 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 10:01 est , 31 october 2013 @entity5 's top lawyer has said the internet giant is ' concerned and outraged ' at claims that the @entity8 has tapped into its private network			1
@entity11 's comments came as newly leaked documents from @entity13 allegedly showed a sketch detailing how the @entity8 accessed @entity5 using a new program known as @entity16			1
the sketch , published by the @entity18 , reportedly caused two @entity5 engineers to ' explode into profanity ' as it showed how to bypass security measures			0
but , after the latest allegations , he released a statement that said : ' we are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks , and it underscores the need for urgent reform			0
' he said : ' we have long been concerned about the possibility of this kind of snooping , which is why we have continued to extend encryption across more and more @entity5 services and links , especially the links in the slide			0
' ' we do not provide any government , including the @entity55 government , with access to our systems , ' he added			0
the @entity8 's director , general @entity58 , denied the agency had illegally accessed internet companies ' servers			2
' this is not @entity8 breaking into any databases			2
it would be illegal for us to do that ... but i can tell you factually we do not have access to @entity5 servers , @entity72 servers			0
we go through a court order , ' he told @entity75			0
in a statement tweeted earlier in the day the @entity8 did n't deny the existence of @entity16 but insisted that it was not collecting ' vast quantities ' of data on its citizens			1
seized : the @entity8 has reportedly secretly broken into main communications links that connect @entity72 and @entity5 data centers around the world			1
this photo shows a @entity5 data center in @entity86 , @entity87 the @entity8 's principal tool to exploit the data links is a project called @entity16 , operated jointly with the agency 's @entity92 counterpart , @entity94			1
the program uses an unnamed telecommunications provider giving secret access to a cable for @entity5 and @entity72 to pass unencrypted traffic between their servers			0
' @entity8 is a foreign intelligence agency			2
and we â€™re focused on discovering and developing intelligence about valid foreign intelligence targets only , ' a @entity8 statement read , according to @entity35			2
the @entity18 had reported that the @entity8 sent millions of records from @entity72 and @entity5 internal networks to data warehouses at the agency 's @entity108 , @entity110 headquarters , every day			1
the newspaper cited documents leaked by former @entity8 contractor @entity13 , which included a slide from an agency presentation entitled ' @entity116 '			2
the slide featured a sketch showing where the ' public internet ' meets the internal ' @entity28 ' of user data			0
denial : @entity8 director general @entity58 says the agency has not illegally accessed servers on the sketch , a note added that encryption was ' added and remove here ! ' and the artist jotted a smiley face - in what the @entity18 called a ' cheeky celebration of victory over @entity5 security '			1
' two engineers with close ties to @entity5 exploded in profanity when they saw the drawing , ' the @entity18 reported			0
in the 30 days after january 9 , field collectors were said to have processed and sent back more than 180 million new records - ranging from ' metadata ' , which would indicate who sent or received emails and when , to content such as text , audio and video			1
both companies said they had not given the @entity8 permission to do so and were not aware of the activity			2
the @entity18 said @entity8 and @entity94 were copying entire data flows across fiber - optic cables that carry information between the data centers of the @entity154 giants			1
general @entity58 said he @entity8 was not authorized to access data centers and had to go through a court process to obtain it			1
the report comes despite the companies saying their servers are closely guarded and strictly audited			0
according to @entity5 , buildings housing its servers are guarded around - the - clock and secured with heat - sensitive cameras and biometric verification			0
in a statement to the @entity18 , @entity5 said it was ' troubled by allegations of the government intercepting traffic between our data centers , and we are not aware of this activity '			0
at @entity72 a spokesman added : ' we have strict controls in place to protect the security of our data centers , and we have not given access to our data centers to the @entity8 or to any other government agency			1
' @entity181 officials and the @entity182 , which oversees the @entity8 , declined to comment , the @entity18 said			0
revelations : the information was obtained by former @entity8 contractor , @entity13 the @entity8 already collects data from @entity5 , @entity72 and other technology companies under another program known as prism - details of which were revealed by @entity13 earlier this year			1
the program legally compels the companies to provide the agency with information that matches court - approved search terms			0
the collection of data by @entity16 would be illegal in the @entity55 , but the operations take place overseas , where the @entity8 can presume anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner , the @entity18 said .			1

in 30 day the @entity8 is said to have *gleaned* 180 million records including text , audio and video - and who sent it to whom and when they sent it
@entity8 : claims that we collect data this way are not true
