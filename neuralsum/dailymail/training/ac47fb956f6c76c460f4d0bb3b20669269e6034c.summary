@entity0 has spoken about the pain of seeing @entity2 ‘ slip away ’ as she succumbed to dementia			1
the prime minister said it had been hard for him to see her deteriorate from being at the ‘ height of her powers ’ to falling victim to the disease			1
he revealed that every member of the @entity13 signed up yesterday morning to become ‘ dementia friends ’ – meaning they will receive training in how to deal with patients with the condition			1
and he revealed he was worried he might develop dementia in later life			2
@entity2 died last year after long battle against dementia ; a fight which was vividly brought to the screen by @entity33 in @entity34			1
speaking to @entity40 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ it was very noticeable and obviously having seen her at the height of her powers when i started working for the @entity46 back in 1988 , you see what an effect this has on someone			1
‘ i 'm actually sitting in @entity48 in what 's called the @entity50 , named by @entity51 , there 's a picture of her staring at me from the wall as we speak which is slightly disconcerting			2
‘ i 've seen that with the parents of friends as well - one minute at the height of their powers , brilliant intellect and brains - then suddenly they start to slip away			1
’ mr @entity0 said no one in his family had ever had dementia , but he had seen it affect friends			1
‘ also as a constituency mp , i 've had that heart - breaking wander round care homes where you see people who have often been well - looked after but have slipped away into this silent world , ’ he said			0
‘ it 's a heart breaking thing to see			2
’ former @entity77 cricketer sir @entity76 spoke on monday night of his heartbreak of deciding to end visits to his dementia - suffering father while he was in a care home			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ it makes you desperately sad to see what happens to individuals ' lives and families ' lives			2
listening to @entity76 last night the whole country would have been moved by what he said			0
‘ but it was also a wake - up call for me when i had it properly explained to me - it 's not just a natural part of ageing , it is a disease like cancer , like strokes , like heart disease			0
’ he said there should be more research into a cure for dementia , as well as better training in hospitals and the training of thousands more ‘ dementia friends ’ – volunteers who learn how to cope with sufferers			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ i 've become one myself , i did the training , it 's a fascinating thing to do and i 'd encourage people to do it			1
‘ we discussed it at the @entity13 this morning and the whole @entity13 has agreed to become dementia friends			1
we are going to make sure that happens at a future @entity13 meeting			0
‘ it ’s a fascinating thing to do to put yourselves into the shoes of someone with dementia and work out how best to help them			0
’ chancellor @entity123 was pictured crying at the funeral of the former @entity46 leader last year on monday , the @entity26 found that almost all dementia sufferers will experience poor care at some point			1
nine in 10 care homes and hospitals fail to provide better treatment			0
the prime minister said the findings were ‘ not acceptable ’ – and said all care home staff should be dementia friends			1
‘ one of the things that we did with the @entity26 is to get it to focus on the real sharp end ; to get into the hospitals , get into the care homes , and perhaps spend a little less time worrying about every single dentist chair and gp surgery and get into the care homes where people could be suffering or be mistreated			0
‘ what they found is unacceptable and the practice needs to change - no doubt about it			0
’ mr @entity0 told a carer who was looking after a relative with dementia that his experience with his son @entity157 , who died five years ago after suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy , was that carers needed plenty of rest			2
‘ as someone who looked after a deeply disabled child , you must n’t be too tough on yourself			0
the best thing you can do as a carer is make sure you get the breaks , get the space so you can go on being a good carer when you are caring			0
‘ we ’re not angels , luckily some of us are but most of us are n't - so you need to have the space to go on being a carer			0
’ the prime minister said he worried that he may have to cope with dementia himself			0
‘ anyone who has seen someone suffering from dementia , you ca n't help thinking what if that happens to me , what would it be like , how would i react , ’ he said			0
‘ this national debate that 's taking place is a good thing because instead of it being a silent crisis , we are all facing up to it and we 're thinking more about what we can do to avoid getting dementia , how we ’d cope with a relative with dementia , how we can be better with neighbours with dementia			2
