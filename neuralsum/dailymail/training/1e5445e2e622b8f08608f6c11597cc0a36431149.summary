anyone else fed up with the fawning over the @entity2 10 years on ? boring			1
here ’s what that team achieved – failure in @entity7 when the @entity8 was there for the taking , and at the same time they directly helped @entity10 become greater than @entity11			1
funny how the @entity11 lovers conveniently ignore all this			0
the myth of the @entity2 grows beyond all credible recognition as every year passes without another title or any @entity8 success for the @entity18			1
one @entity32 is living in the past so much they have even written a book about them			0
i ’ve already ripped the myth of the @entity2 to shreds elsewhere			1
in brief , here ’s why			0
when they were named the best ever @entity22 team , they were overrated : they collected 90 points – five fewer than @entity44 the following season ; they scored 20 goals fewer than @entity46 in 2011 - 12			1
it was a good side that won the title in 2003 - 04 , but they certainly were n’t the best @entity22 team ever , and they probably were n’t the best @entity2 side to win the title			1
the @entity22 title was the only trophy they won that season – other @entity2 teams did doubles , @entity59 did the @entity60 in 1999			1
how could the 2003 - 04 team be the best ? it does n’t add up			1
they ended the season playing for draws just to preserve the unbeaten record – the best teams go out to win matches , and win them in style			2
but when placed into its historical context , that invincible season has proved to be the worst thing that ever happened to @entity73			0
let ’s take a look at what happened : by the end of february , the possibility of going the season unbeaten in the @entity22 was becoming a probability			1
@entity2 won at @entity44 on february 21 and that was a huge hurdle for the @entity18 to overcome			2
many thought that if @entity2 could avoid defeat at home to @entity59 on march 28 that would be their last big test			2
they drew the game 1 - 1			0
including those two matches , @entity2 played five @entity8 matches in that period , an @entity91 tie at @entity92 , two @entity8 games with @entity94 , and then the quarter final first leg away to @entity44			2
that ’s a total of nine games in five weeks			0
@entity11 kept the same team for all nine games apart from alternating @entity100 and @entity101 , and using @entity102 twice at left back instead of @entity103			0
after that draw against @entity59 , @entity2 faced four games in nine days over the @entity107 period			2
@entity59 knocked the @entity18 out of the @entity91 at @entity108			0
a few days later @entity44 turned up at @entity109 and @entity111 ’s late goal ended the @entity18 ' @entity8 challenge			0
a @entity114 masterclass resurrected @entity2 on @entity115 after they trailed to @entity117 at half time			1
and then on @entity119 it finished goalless at @entity121			0
@entity114 celebrates the @entity22 triumph as @entity2 set about ruling @entity124 football that side created by @entity11 was widely regarded as the best @entity2 squad ever assembled thirteen games in just over six weeks called for some astute squad management			1
but with one or two exceptions the same players were used over and over again , and so their @entity132 campaign suffered , and they did n’t have enough in the tank to beat @entity44			0
i suspect that @entity11 became obsessed with his place in history , and completing the league season unbeaten , rather than focusing on how to win both the title and the @entity8			2
what a mistake ! a huge error because had @entity2 beaten @entity44 they would have had to face @entity141 and then @entity142 to secure their first ever @entity8 success			2
that would have guaranteed @entity2 ’s place in history as the first @entity148 club to ever win @entity7 ’s top prize			1
@entity11 ’s obsession with the unbeaten @entity22 season cost them in @entity7 , and opened the door for @entity10 to win the @entity8 with @entity142			1
off the back of that he got the job at @entity44 , and became @entity11 ’s unbeatable nemesis over the last 10 years , when only token @entity91 glory has papered over the dirty great seismic cracks			0
@entity161 tackles @entity92 midfielder @entity162 during the disappointing draw at @entity92 @entity164 scores for @entity59 to defeat @entity2 in the @entity91 semi-final at @entity108 @entity2 were dumped out of the @entity8 by @entity44 after this @entity111 strike at @entity109 @entity10 ( hugging @entity167 ) won the @entity8 that season with @entity142 @entity2 ended up winning the title by 11 points that year			1
if @entity11 had rested top players at the right time in the run - in that season , they may have lost a couple of games in the league , but they had room to spare			2
instead the @entity179 chose to rinse those players , stay unbeaten , and it cost them the even bigger prize of @entity8 success			0
the @entity2 – draws with @entity183 , @entity92 and @entity184			0
is that glory ? the @entity2 should have won the title and the @entity8			0
instead , the mismanagement of @entity2 allowed @entity10 to turn @entity11 from a man who nearly won something in @entity7 , to a specialist in failure			1
@entity192 concerned by @entity44 gap like our @entity194 .			0

@entity2 went unbeaten during the 2003 - 04 @entity22 season
but they did **n't** *capitalise* on their *dominance* and failed in @entity7
@entity24 and @entity114 were **n't** part of best - ever @entity2 side
