you think , “ what have i done ? why do i deserve this ? ”			2
it is the luck of the draw			2
i just happened to be born from a certain set of parents			0

that can lead to anxiety , which can lead to agoraphobia			1
’ for @entity9 , it means days spent alone in his bedroom playing video games or using social media			1

which is basically a phobia of leaving the house			0
that has been the biggest part of my life			0
at the moment it is an achievement if i can go four minutes in the car out of the house			0
‘ a normal day , depressingly , is devoid of much purpose			0
i just wake up when i want to			0
i will lie in bed for an hour , maybe get up and play some @entity156			0
there have been times when i have not been able to leave my bedroom			0
for the past eight years on and off that has pretty much been my life			1
