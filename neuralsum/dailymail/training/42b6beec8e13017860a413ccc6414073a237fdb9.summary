by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 07:47 est , 16 august 2013 two brazen thieves were caught on camera lounging on a sofa while swigging stolen wine after breaking into a house in broad daylight			2
@entity7 , 34 , and @entity8 , 22 , can be clearly seen on the footage searching the front room of the house in @entity12 , @entity13 , before complaining there 's nothing to steal from the property			1
they call the owner ‘ cheap ’ and whinge that they will only get ‘ a tenner ’ for the @entity22 box			0
the pair were caught on police cameras which had been set up in the property , a decoy house to catch burglars , which is one of many houses , sheds and garages in the area being used to ‘ blitz ’ crime in the @entity35			1
scroll down to watch video caught on camera : @entity8 , 22 , pictured left holding a stolen bottle of wine and @entity22 box , and @entity7 , 34 , pictured right , were both filmed breaking in to a property before complaining there was n't much to steal brazen : @entity7 , 34 , then decided to take a few minutes to relax on the sofa while swigging wine stolen from the kitchen - before tipping it over the floor when he realised it had been filled with water the 34 - year - old then disappears from the screen before returning with a wine bottle and plonks himself down on the sofa			1
the thief then opens the bottle of wine before complaining it has been filled with water and chucks it on the floor			0
he then tries to wipe off his fingerprints with his top			0
eventually @entity8 , in a coat , suggests they should leave before neighbours raise the alarm			2
law , 34 , who lived in the same street as the targeted house , was arrested within hours of the offence on 24 june			2
complaining : the pair can be heard on the video footage calling the owner of the property in @entity12 , @entity13 , cheap while whinging they will only get a ' tenner ' for the @entity22 box in no rush : @entity7 can be seen sitting on the sofa in the property - apparently unconcerned about being caught by the owners @entity8 handed himself in weeks later - bringing the @entity22 box with him			1
law was jailed for eight months and @entity8 was given a ten - week suspended sentence after both pleaded guilty to burglary last month			1
sergeant @entity86 , from @entity87 , said : ' the pair were completely unaware that their every move was being filmed by the cameras that were dotted around the property			2
' we are using more and more of these sites to catch unsuspecting thieves - houses , sheds garages and outbuildings can be fitted with equipment which is portable and easy to install , meaning any property in a burglary hot spot area can be quickly converted to capture thieves			0
ignorant bliss : the pair eventually decide its time to leave - completely unaware that everything has been caught on camera in court : @entity7 was jailed for eight months while @entity8 was given a 10 - week suspended sentence for burglary ' the cameras also work on infra - red meaning we can download clear images - even ones filmed at night			1
' we also work with the local community to reduce the likelihood of being a victim of crime in the first place and officers continue to offer crime prevention advice and encourage people to register property through the online property recording website immobilise			0
' as police officers we see the negative impact crime can have on , not only people ’s property but also their sense of safety and their quality of life			0
that is why we will relentlessly pursue burglars and ensure they are brought before the courts			0
