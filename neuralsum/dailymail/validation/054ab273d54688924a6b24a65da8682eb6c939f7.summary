mps will be banned from claiming expenses for dinners , tv licences and taxis before 11pm following the general election			1
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) confirmed that politicians ' perks will be cut from may 8			1
the move , which is likely to cause anger among mps who already complain that the system leaves them out of pocket , emerged as the watchdog announced a raft of changes for the next parliament			1
the @entity6 has confirmed that certain perks for politicians will be cut from may 8 @entity20 said : ' we will implement the rule changes agreed in december 2013 , including removing hospitality claims and the late sitting food subsidy			1
we have tightened the rules on taxis and hotels after late sittings of the @entity29			2
' we will no longer allow claims , under the accommodation rules , for tv licences and home contents insurance			0
' elsewhere , staffing budgets are to go up 1 per cent to £ 147,000 for mps in the @entity37 area , and £ 140,000 for those from outside the capital			2
the office costs budget is rising 0.5 per cent to reflect inflation , but accommodation budgets have been frozen			0
the watchdog had proposed a raft of curbs to expenses in 2013 as part of a wider package that included salaries rising by 10 per cent from £ 67,000 to £ 74,000			2
it suggested that trimming perks and pension benefits would offset the costs of the controversial pay rise			2
prime minister @entity55 has said that a 10 per cent pay rise for @entity35 is ' unacceptable ' at a time when public sector rises are restricted to one per cent the changes will go ahead even though the pay rise is still subject to review and @entity55 , @entity59 and @entity60 have signalled they may block it			0
mr @entity55 has said he regards the hike as ' unacceptable ' at a time when public sector rises are restricted to one per cent , while mr @entity59 and mr @entity60 have said they do not believe it should go ahead			0
the move - which is likely to cause anger among mps who already complain that the system leaves them out of pocket - emerged as @entity6 announced expenses rules for the next parliament			1
but while the expenses reductions will now come in to force automatically on may 8 , the @entity35 salary boost will be subject to a review due to be carried out in the weeks after the poll			1
the watchdog theoretically has the final decision on the issue - although there have been suggestions that the law could be changed in order to prevent the increase			0
the cross-party @entity88 has previously condemned the expenses cuts , arguing that the rules are already ' considerably less generous ' than in many companies			1
highlighting the plan to drop the £ 15 currently claimable for dinner when the @entity29 sits beyond 7.30pm , the committee said : ' if such expenses are not met by the employer , then the employee is able to claim tax relief on subsistence costs of travel between work places			0
' the rules for @entity35 are already considerably less generous than this			0
' we also note that when there is whipped business , members must be within easy reach of the division lobbies			0
' once again , we consider there needs to be a stronger evidence base before it can be asserted that these are costs which other professionals would expect to meet for themselves , unless they had been dealt with through a salary supplement rather than expenses			0
' the committee said mps routinely worked 60 or 70 hours a week and the tightening of the expenses system in the wake of the scandal that rocked @entity122 already meant some had taken to sleeping in their offices			1
' we do not consider that @entity6 has made a case for changing the boundary of the existing scheme of business costs and expenses , ' the report said			1
the changes will see a halt to claims for tea and biscuits , and hotels only allowed if they are booked after 1am .			0

@entity6 says perks will be cut
mps will be banned claiming expenses for dinners and taxis before 11pm
the cuts will begin on may 8 , the *day* after the next general election
the move is likely to anger mps , who say the system leaves them out of pocket
