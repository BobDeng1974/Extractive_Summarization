he ’s a bit early for @entity2 … but perhaps someone told this robin that the early bird catches the worm			0
and in this case , he ’s catching mealworms , breadcrumbs and even bowls of hot porridge			0
the redbreast has started visiting @entity13 as many as 15 times a day , cheekily tapping on her window every morning until she lets him into her kitchen			1
@entity19 the @entity18 visits @entity13 's kitchen up to 15 times a day to peck on breadcrumbs , worms and porridge while @entity19 snacks on most things laid out by mrs @entity26 , his favourite is cooked porridge , she said mrs @entity26 , who has eight grandchildren , cooks porridge for the animal to keep him warm in the winter mrs @entity26 has tried to shoo the animal away to ' find his friends ' but he returns day after day for more food once inside , he breakfasts on the array of food that she buys to feed to the birds in her garden – as well as the treats his ‘ surrogate mother ’ whips up just for him			1
and then he makes himself at home , fluttering to and fro through the back door all day as he picks up more snacks			1
grandmother - of - eight mrs @entity26 , 77 , said the bird , who she calls @entity19 , first appeared over the summer in the garden of the home she shares with husband @entity50 , 82 , near @entity51 , @entity52			1
she added : ‘ i did n’t go out into the garden one day and then he started coming into the house – he thinks i ’m his mummy			2
the 77 - year - old said @entity19 has begun following her into the house after she did n't go into the garden one day favourite things : mrs @entity26 leaves out a tray with a variety of snacks on it for the little bird to enjoy making himself at home : @entity19 is not frightened off by either mrs @entity26 or her husband but is n't quite comfortable enough to start eating out of the 77 - year - old 's hand while the pensioner enjoys having the bird in her home , she said she will be forced to make him wear a nappy the animal appeared at @entity13 's window one day when the pensioner failed to go out into the garden puffing his red and grey belly out , the bird rests on the edge of a chair and on mrs @entity26 's kitchen counter taking off : once he has had enough to eat @entity19 goes out back into the garden before returning later the bird is not frightened by humans and once flew over the postman 's head to get into the house @entity19 taps on the window with his beak when he wants to be let back into the house in @entity52 ' umpteen times i ’ve let him out the window and said “ go and find your friends ”			1
‘ but he goes away for a little while and then the next day , he ’s back			0
' he ’s not scared of anybody			0
the other day , i opened the door for the postman and @entity19 flew over the postman ’s head and came in			2
‘ he loves porridge – i cook it for him to keep him nice and warm for the winter			0
he ’s not eating out of my hand yet , but i ’m working on it			0
