helplessly stuck in a patch of mud , this tiny zebra foal appeared doomed to a prolonged and agonising death			1
then along came the most unlikely of rescuers - a gigantic bull rhino who had been attracted by the creature 's desperate struggles and mewling cries			1
it was the work of a moment for the enormous animal to hoist the foal out of the mud and to safety			2
but tragically this was one rescue that did not have a happy ending			0
oblivious to its own strength , the rhino ended up impaling the zebra on its horn			2
it is not clear whether this is the point that the foal was disembowelled by the bull 's clumsy rescue @entity52 , a field guide and wildlife photographer , spotted the foal stuck in a deep and pitiless patch of mud while he was showing visitors around the @entity28 in @entity59			1
nearby a bull rhino was chasing some females , then being chased away in return , but the foal 's mother and her herd were nowhere to be seen			1
' the foal must have been there for quite some time , ' wrote mr @entity52 in @entity68			2
the bull rhino , he went on , finally gave up on his futile advances			1
wandering down to the water , he found the hapless foal			0
@entity73 , the huge beast began prodding the youngster with his horn			2
after a while the bull , growing impatient with his toy , sank his snout deep into the mire before quickly lifting the foal from the mud			1
this was no altruistic rescue mission , having helped it escape the morass he merely dropped the animal and wandered off			0
but then he came back to the exhausted youngster for another look			0
apparently wanting to see the foal from another angle , he used his horn to move it into a different position , and disembowelled it			1
dropping it again , the bull flopped to the mud himself for a roll - around , almost crushing the dying baby zebra			2
the stricken animal did n't last much longer			0
boredom : the bull rhino had earlier got nowhere with his advances towards a couple of nearby cows mr @entity106 said many things went through his mind as he watched the tragedy unfold , but his foremost thought was to ' let nature be nature '			1
' i have had many comments from people seeing the photos asking why i did not retrieve the foal from the mud , ' he said			0
' the zebra â€™s herd was gone so even if i could have , he would not have survived as his mother and harem were nowhere to be seen and thus he would have died from starvation			0
' mr @entity106 added that the foal 's mother probably knew her child was caught in a hopeless situation			1
she probably had good reason for abandoning it to its fate , he said			0
despite the foal 's sad and early end , he said he felt lucky to see what he described as ' an amazing interaction between two species			0
' ' i have been guiding for almost ten years and may go on for many and still never witness something as amazing and melancholy as this			0
