thanks to @entity2 , it 's never been so quick and easy to shop for a man , and now with fashion app @entity4 you can shop for a new wardrobe with equal ease			1
the newly launched app works just like @entity2 but rather potential dates popping up on screens , users are tempted with lust - worthy fashion			1
style hunters swipe right to ' grab ' a potential fashion match and swipe left to reject items that do n't tickle their fancy			1
it 's been a hit with celebrity users too			0
@entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 are all @entity24 users , as is @entity46 , who appeared at the apps official launch last week			0
but be warned - it might not be quite so easy to swipe away potential fashion matches as it is to reject the frogs on @entity2			1
once users grab an item it stays in the ' grabs on the go ' folder until they decide to buy or discard it			2
for a more curated experience , users can also shop in the ' featured collections ' section , as shown above the best part ? the clever little app will send alerts whenever a grabbed item comes on sale			2
so how does the art of fashion match - making work ? users set preferences according to price range , brand and category of clothing			1
the app features products from 1,500 brands from @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 to the likes of @entity85 , matches and @entity87			0
shoppers can also set the app to recognise their taste by choosing as many of the 23 styles that best describes their fashion groove			2
so whether users see themselves as ' @entity95 ' , ' @entity96 ' or ' @entity97 ' - they can tailor potential fashion matches to suit			1
for a more curated experience , there 's the ' featured collections ' section , which is added to daily			0
example collections include items from recent magazine issues , best bargains or picks for upcoming events			0
just like @entity2 , men are welcome too : @entity110 modelling ( left ) and a selection of male grabs ( right ) founders @entity113 , 28 , and @entity114 , 29 , first launched @entity4 as a desktop site but after seeing all their users trying to access it on their mobiles decided to abandon their website for an app in the mould of @entity2			1
' we realised by displaying fashion products in this way , users could discover fashion on the go , ' says @entity114 , himself a self - confessed @entity2 fan			1
' but instead of swiping right for awkward conversations , you can swipe right to shop			0
' @entity113 adds : ' because the app has that addictive nature we find our users ' snacking ' on the app regularly for short bursts of inspiration			2
' users tend to save the products they like , only to check out later in the month in one big spree or when they get a sale alert			0
' with new products added to @entity4 every hour , there 's endless potential to fall in fashion love .			0

app works like @entity2 but with fashion finds rather than potential dates
swipe right to ' grab ' a potential fashion match and swipe left to reject it
users set preferences according to price , brand , category and style
