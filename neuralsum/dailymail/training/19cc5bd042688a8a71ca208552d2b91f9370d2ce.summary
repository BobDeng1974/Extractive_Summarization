it 's natural to assume that animals with large teeth and fearsome reputations such as the lion or shark are the world ’s deadliest killers			1
but appearances can be deceptive and if you judge a creature ’s deadliness by the number of people it kills every year , the tiny mosquito comes out on top			1
@entity17 , which is among the diseases carried by mosquitoes , kills more than 600,000 people a year , while 200million people suffer from it on a daily basis - far more than unfortunate individuals that are bitten by crocodiles or wolves			1
it reveals that the mosquito - @entity38 for ' little fly ' - kills more people than all the other animals listed put together malaria is spread by mosquitoes and occurs in around 100 countries			1
it kills approximately 725,000 people every year and imposes a heavy social and economic burden in developing countries , especially in @entity50 and @entity51			1
it is estimated that 207million people suffered from the disease in 2012 and 90 per cent of deaths occurred in @entity50 - 77 per cent of which were among children who did not live to see their sixth birthday			2
mild cases of malaria cause flu - like symptoms , high fever and chills , which are particularly dangerous to pregnant women and children			0
severe malaria can cause lifelong intellectual disabilities and can result in @entity69 's economic impact is estimated to cost billions of dollars in lost productivity each year			2
in the last 12 years new cases of malaria have fallen by 25 per cent , and deaths by 42 per cent thanks to better diagnosis , pesticides and the use of bed nets			0
it is the aim of the @entity79 to eliminate the disease completely , but the malaria parasite has begun to develop resistance to insecticides and drugs currently used , making the fight extra hard			0
@entity30 shared an infographic on his blog to highlight the world ’s 15 deadliest animals , based on the number of humans who die from coming into contact with them every year			1
it reveals that the mosquito – @entity38 for ‘ little fly ’ - kills more people than all the other animals listed put together			1
‘ malaria threatens half of the world ’s population and causes billions of dollars in lost productivity annually , ’ @entity30 wrote on his blog			1
the @entity79 has long been working on ways to eradicate malaria , as well as other mosquito - borne diseases , which include dengue fever , yellow fever , and encephalitis			2
there are more than 2,500 species of mosquitos , found in over 100 countries and every region apart from @entity116			0
‘ during the peak breeding seasons , they outnumber every other animal on @entity120 , except termites and ants , ’ @entity30 wrote			1
‘ and they affect population patterns on a grand scale : in many malarial zones , the disease drives people inland and away from the coast , where the climate is more welcoming to mosquitoes			1
’ the tiny killer : @entity17 , which is among the diseases carried by mosquitoes ( pictured ) , kills more than 600,000 people a year , while 200 million people suffer from it on a daily basis sharks kill just 10 people a year , lions 100 and crocodiles 1,000 , despite having among the most fearsome reputations - according to the infographic			1
humans wipe out 475,000 fellow people in murders and wars , but diseases such as schistosomiasis caused by freshwater snails , chagas disease carried by bugs , sleeping sickness spread by tsetse flies and rabies , which is transmitted by dogs , are also responsible for thousands of deaths			1
stealthy snails : humans wipe out 475,000 fellow people in murders and wars , but diseases such as schistosomiasis caused by freshwater snails ( pictured ) , chagas disease , sleeping sickness and rabies are also responsible for thousands of deaths every year not so deadly after all ? @entity137 ( pictured left ) kill just 10 people a year , lions 100 ( pictured right ) and crocodiles 1,000 , despite having among the most fearsome reputations , according to the infographic the @entity165 realised the deadliness of mosquitoes and were investigating how to use the bugs as biological weapons , recently discovered documents revealed			1
ss - chief @entity172 ’s entomological institute at @entity173 investigated whether malaria - infected mosquitoes could survive transport into enemy territory			2
the institute , set up by @entity172 in 1942 , conducted trials of different types of mosquitoes to find which could be kept alive long enough to ‘ transport ’ malaria from the lab to @entity183 troops			0
in 1944 , a particular type of anopheles mosquito known for its capacity to transmit malaria to humans was recommended for use , according to an article in science journal @entity193			0
the project was ‘ a bizarre mix of @entity172 's smattering of scientific knowledge , personal paranoia , an esoteric world view , and genuine concerns about his ss troops ’ , the article ’s author @entity194 told @entity204			2
@entity205 , which is blamed for 10,000 deaths a year , is spread by tiny parasitic snails living in rivers and lakes in subtropical and tropical regions across the globe			0
they burrow into human skin , moving closer to the abdomen to lay their eggs			0
the disease , which can include paralysis of the legs and vomiting blood as well as flu - like symptoms , is caused by the immune system reacting to the eggs			0
it is associated with poor living conditions , overcrowding , poor sanitation and a lack of clean water			0
a total of 10,000 people are killed every year by @entity150 , spread by the assassin bug - also known as the kissing bug			2
it is estimated that between seven and eight million people living in @entity236 have @entity238 disease			0
its early symptoms include fever , swollen lymph nodes and headaches			0
while up to 70 per cent of people do not show further symptoms , some individuals suffer an enlarged oesophagus or colon , and others have enlarged ventricles of the heart , which can result in heart failure			0
elsewhere , sleeping sickness kills an estimated 10,000 people a year			1
in humans , bile injected by the tsetse fly erupts into a red sore and within a few weeks , the person can experience fever , swollen lymph glands , aching muscles and joints , headaches and irritability			0
as the disease takes hold , people can suffer changes in personality , confusion , slurred speech , seizures and difficulty in walking and talking			0
not - so - smiling assassin : a total of 10,000 people are killed every year by @entity150 , which is spread by the assassin bug , also known as the kissing bug ( pictured )			2

@entity17 , which is among the diseases carried by mosquitoes , kills more than 600,000 people a year and affects over 200million
@entity30 created an graphic to highlight the world ’s 15 deadliest animals
figures are based on the *official* number of humans who die each year
mosquitoes kill more people than the rest of the list put together
sharks kill just 10 people a year , lions 100 and crocodiles 1,000
