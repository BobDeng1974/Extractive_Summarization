the thought of entering the dating scene as a woman in her 50s was a daunting idea for @entity5			1
she only had two long - term partners - first her ex-husband then a toyboy who was 21 years her junior			0
neither of them worked out and she was forced to seek other options			0
but what ms @entity5 quickly and painfully learned was that in the world of online dating , a ' rotten profile photo ' will attract all the wrong people			1
this was the motivation behind the launch of ' @entity23 ' last month - a @entity24 - based makeover studio dedicated purely to producing profile pictures for online dating			1
@entity23 was inspired by @entity5 's experiences of posting good and bad photos online @entity23 offers styling , hair and make up for internet daters of all ages ms @entity5 , who has been a single mum for 16 years , never thought she would find love online			1
and having met both her ex-husband of 16 years and previous partner of six years at work , internet dating was a foreign concept			2
' now i 've been online dating for about 18 months , ' ms @entity5 told @entity45			1
' when i first started i had no idea and thought i 'd put up any old rotten profile photo			1
i found that many of the men who were contacting me were n't serious and were just looking for a fling			0
' then i changed my photo to a better one only to find that i was having more success with men who were genuinely interested and were on the same level of intelligence			1
' @entity57 ( pictured ) also had some photos taken by @entity23 to help jazz up her profile that one photo made a world of difference for ms @entity5 and she wanted to share this with fellow love - seekers			1
' it was a real eye opener for me and i 've come to realise that a picture of yourself when it comes to online dating is very important , ' she said			1
' a profile photo gives insight into the person			1
it says a lot about them , their style and their lifestyle			0
' for example , if i came across @entity80 then i just would n't be interested			0
i have a check list and i totally agree that a picture is worth a thousand words			0
' photos taken by the studio aims to produce ' natural and real photos of people looking their best ' @entity23 is suitably inspired by @entity90 's pop song as the co-founder of @entity23 , suitably inspired by @entity90 's pop song , ms @entity5 is now using her experience to help others show their ' inner beauty '			1
' it 's not about photo - shopping pictures but more about producing natural and real photos of people looking their best , ' she said			2
' we want to bring out their personality and character in the image , not something that 's glamorous			0
' ms @entity5 believes the @entity105 period will not only be a busy time for shopper but also for those who are searching for ' the one '			2
the thought of entering the dating scene as a woman in her 50s was initially a daunting idea for @entity5 ( pictured ) the 55 - year - old has been online dating for 18 months now and says it 's been a success ms @entity5 is taking a break from the dating scene as she 's found herself a man ' people have a lot more time because they 're on holidays , ' she said			1
' it 's also a poignant time of year which highlights the fact that they 're alone			0
' i know this because i 've been there before - i remember times that i sat on the couch and cried on christmas day when my kids were with my ex. ' this is why this idea for a makeover studio is close to my heart			1
' while ms @entity5 is taking a break from the dating scene as she 's found herself a man , the 55 - year - old says the whole experience has been ' a great learning curve '			2
@entity23 gave @entity144 a make over and he looks much younger from his photos below the before photos : ' @entity23 ' is a @entity24 - based makeover studio dedicated purely to producing profile pictures for online dating			1
' there is someone out there for everyone , ' she said			0
' i hope the experience at our studio will bring out the confidence in people and i want them to know that if i 'm able to do it , then anyone can			0
' @entity23 offers styling , hair and make up for internet daters of all ages			2
set up a ' date phone ' with an alternative mobile number , @entity5 said			2
' just get an old handset and get a new sim card			0
do pay as you go			0
' do n't give out the real one until you trust the person			0
' same goes for your email address			0
set up an account with your dating name			0
' profile warnings 1 ) if they do n't have a photo it generally means they are either married or ugly			2
always ask to see a photo before you start communicating ; 2 ) beware of black and white photos - probably retouched or taken years earlier ; 3 ) for fuzzy , out of focus and distant photos - assume reason one ; 4 ) @entity188 only shot or a profile description which says ' a bit overweight or large - ish ' means they 're probably gargantuan ; 5 ) high school education only - sorry this is a bit sweeping but i need a conversation with my partner ; 6 ) people who put a picture up of them when they were 17 - years - old is because of reasons one , four or five ; 7 ) ' undecided ' about having kids means they want kids so beware if you do n't or ca n't ; 8 ) never been married , if older , means a real lack of commitment - i learned the hard way ; 9 ) the word ' milf ' in their wish list unless of course you 're up for it ; 10 ) anywhere the word ' lonely ' comes up .			2

@entity5 , 55 , has been online dating for 18 months
she realised her ' rotten profile photo ' attracted *unsuitable* matches
when she opted for a nicer picture , she immediately attracted men who were genuinely interested in her
this inspired her to launch makeover studio ' @entity23 ' to help others create profile photos for online dating
