by @entity0 @entity2 is at risk of economic decline as it rapidly turns into a ‘ super-aged ’ nation , a report claimed yesterday			1
the ‘ unprecedented ’ pace of ageing will slow growth over the next 20 years , according to research by the ratings agency @entity10			1
one in five of the population is predicted to be 65 or over in little more than a decade			2
@entity10 's used @entity13 definitions to examine which countries would be classed as ' super-aged ' by 2030			1
a society is considered to be ‘ ageing ’ if over- 65s make up at least 7 per cent of the population , ‘ aged ’ when the figure is at least 14 per cent , and when it tops 20 per cent it is considered to be a ‘ super-aged ’ society the report warns that countries around the world will see their economies suffer because of a rapidly ageing population and they will create a ‘ demographic tax ’ as fewer people of working - age affect levels of production , while the need to support more retired and elderly people will slash the amount of savings available for investment , analysts warned			1
they also suggest that immigration – often cited by experts as a way to counter the effects of an ageing population – has only a small or temporary effect			0
an influx of foreign workers , although bringing in younger employees and encouraging investment from abroad , could only ‘ partially mitigate ’ the effects of ageing , said the report			0
the author of the report , @entity52 , warned : ‘ demographic transition , frequently considered a long - term problem , is upon us now and will significantly lower economic growth			0
’ just 23 countries will be classes as ' not - ageing ' by 2030 , piling pressure on public services and holding economies back middle - class are warned over their pensions ' it 's amazing , really , the spread of grey - haired people in @entity2 ' by 2025 , @entity2 will be among 11 nations expected to be ‘ super-aged ’			1
more than one in five people are 65 and have retired or are approaching retirement			0
@entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 have already reached that stage , while a further ten – including @entity76 , the @entity77 and @entity78 – will be there by 2020			1
there are predicted to be 34 super-aged countries by 2030			2
the report said : ‘ @entity82 declines in fertility rates and infant mortality and increased life expectancy during the 20th century led to sustained population growth , with the world population increasing four-fold over this period			2
‘ the same factors are changing the age structure of populations across both developed and developing countries in the 21st century			0
’ around six in ten of the countries rated by @entity10 are ageing , with seven per cent of their population aged 65 or more			1
however , the problem is not exclusive to developed countries			0
some rapidly growing markets such as @entity99 and @entity100 are also facing the issue			0
the report added : ‘ ageing is not just a developed - world problem as is generally believed			0
‘ many emerging markets are already classified as ageing			0
' countries like @entity99 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity100 have rapidly deteriorating demographics			0
' even relatively young countries such as @entity112 and @entity113 are ageing			0
’ @entity10 ’s , which regularly prepares reports for investors and finance firms , said the worst - hit countries will be those with high unemployment and low incomes , such as @entity122 and @entity123			2
it also warned that @entity126 countries where the population is ageing faster than in well - established industrial countries like @entity2 will face ‘ complex and challenging ’ difficulties unknown in the @entity130			1
the first countries set to join @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 with super-age status will be @entity133 and @entity122 – who will be added to the list next year			1
the group will grow to 13 in 2020 when they are joined by @entity76 , the @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity123 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			1
when the @entity2 is added to the super-aged set in 2025 , it will be accompanied by @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , the @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			2
in 2030 , the @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 will complete the group of 34 .			2

@entity10 's ratings agency warns of ' extremely *negative* ' impact on growth
@entity2 , @entity73 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity153 and @entity76 will all be ' super-aged ' by 2030
by 2030 working age population to grow by 13.6 *%* , half the rate since 2000
