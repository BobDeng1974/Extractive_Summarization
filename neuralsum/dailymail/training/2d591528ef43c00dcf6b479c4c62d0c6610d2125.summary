by @entity0 published : 09:56 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 19:44 est , 29 november 2012 a lie detector test trapped nearly 4,000 benefit cheats in just four months			2
the offenders were picking up council tax discounts worth £ 1.4million by falsely claiming they lived alone			1
but they were caught out by technology that analyses phone calls for signs of stress in the speaker ’s voice			1
lie detector : @entity13 council is using voice stress analysis software to catch benefits cheats - a move which is credited as catching some 4,000 fraudsters and saving more than £ 1,400,000 in four months @entity13 council in @entity19 used the system to check on 53,000 households claiming the 25 per cent council tax discount			1
it found that in approximately one in 13 cases , the discount was being wrongly claimed			2
a council spokesman said : ‘ we are very pleased with the results			2
between july and november , we have removed 3,851 people from the list of those claiming the discount			0
‘ it has resulted in additional bills of £ 1.4million of council tax which is payable			1
’ the voice risk analysis system works by analysing the pitch of callers ’ voices when they are asked questions by council officials			1
if the system suspects a lie is being told , a beep sounds in the operator ’s ear			0
once alerted , the operator is trained to begin asking questions that may uncover the truth			0
it can lead to a full investigation into claims for housing benefit , council tax , income support and jobseeker ’s allowance			0
claimants are warned in advance that the phone call is being ‘ recorded and monitored for the detection of fraud ’			1
anyone who refuses to take part in the call is likely to be visited in person for an assessment of their claim			0
it is not the first time lie detectors have been used by councils			0
investigators working for @entity13 council ( pictured ) have begun using software which analyses telephone calls from claimants for signs of stress in their voices lie detectors were trialled by former work and pensions secretary @entity82 four years ago with 24 councils across @entity84 former work and pensions secretary @entity82 ordered a pilot study four years ago in which 24 local authorities tested the concept			1
two years ago , however , the government abandoned the detector tests saying they were unreliable			0
an academic study also raised doubts by suggesting the technology was little better than ‘ astronomy ’ at detecting fraud			1
insurance companies similar systems to catch fraudsters			1
a @entity13 spokesman said claimants who did not speak @entity101 as their first language or had hearing or cognitive problems were exempt from the voice checks			1
@entity106 , the council ’s cabinet member for finance and resources , said : ‘ we are taking a tough stance against fraud			0
‘ any resident found making a false claim will be fully investigated and the necessary action taken			0
’ a spokesman for @entity116 – the private firm contracted by @entity13 to carry out the checks – said it preferred not to describe it as a lie detector test , insisting it used the voice checking system together with ‘ behavioural analysis by trained operators ’			0
he insisted : ‘ the technology is not used in isolation			1
’ a spokesman for @entity130 said he did not know of any other authorities in the capital using the system			0
a similar response was given by a spokesman for the @entity136 , which represents 423 authorities across @entity84			2
@entity138 has used the voice analysis system to check on housing benefit and council tax benefit claims			0
a spokesman for the authority said : ‘ we did try this technology but stopped using it three years ago			2

software analyses calls from claimants for signs of stress in their voices
the technology is similar to that used by insurance companies
@entity158 in @entity19 say they have saved £ 1,400,000
