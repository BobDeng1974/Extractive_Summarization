by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:05 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 06:18 est , 30 september 2013 plans to increase the motorway speed limit to 80mph are still being developed , despite the government announcing it had shelved the idea			2
ministers have admitted that many drivers already travel at 80mph and the policy will be revived in the future			2
the idea was officially abandoned in june because senior @entity11 figures feared it would alienate women voters			2
u-turn : ministers announced the idea of increasing the speed limit to 80mph had been shelved , but now admit it is still being worked on the policy was launched with a fanfare in 2011 by then transport secretary @entity20 , who claimed the 70mph limit had been ' discredited ' and a rise to 80mph would boost the economy			1
but he was replaced by @entity24 who announced the policy was no longer a priority			1
' this is not going to happen with @entity24 as @entity28 , ’ said a source			1
but divisions have emerged in the @entity31 , with junior transport minister @entity32 revealing the plan could be easily introduced because the government has ‘ not stopped work ’ on the idea			1
split : roads minister @entity32 revealed divisions over the decision to drop the 80mph plan the road safety minister said : ‘ mr @entity20 is a great supporter of 80 miles per hour			1
he thinks it 's the right thing to do			0
‘ that 's not a universal view among my colleagues and at the moment , because there are a huge number of other things on , we have not stopped work on it but it 's not a priority			2
‘ given that a lot of people travel at 80 miles per hour and we could enforce 80 miles per hour , at some stage we will want to come back and look at it			0
’ @entity59 ’s speed limits are lower than many other countries in @entity61			0
@entity62 and @entity63 both impose a maximum of 81mph , while @entity65 has no restriction at all			0
the @entity67 expressed disappointment at the decision to drop the speed limit increase			0
motoring groups had argued that 80mph is a safe speed in a modern car , providing drivers leave enough room between vehicles			0
but last year campaign groups estimated that raising the motorway speed limit to 80mph would cost society an extra £ 1billion a year , including £ 766million in fuel bills and more than £ 62million in health costs			0
the groups , which include road safety charity @entity84 , the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) and @entity87 , also estimated that the higher limit would lead to 25 extra deaths and 100 serious injuries a year , as well as 2.2 million more tonnes of carbon emissions .			1

policy was launched with fanfare in 2011 claiming it would boost economy
