by @entity0 published : 03:34 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 17:12 est , 13 march 2014 the prank was supposed to highlight societyâ € ™ s unwillingness to help a person in need			2
but it proved exactly the opposite when one of the pranksters was punched in the face by a passing bystander			1
the stunt , the latest from jackass - style group @entity14 , involves a mock - mugging at an atm			2
one member withdraws cash before being approached by another , balaclava - clad member who demands the money			0
a third member hides and films the fake robbery , and the reaction of bystanders			1
it was supposed to bring the @entity29 - based group â € “ made up of @entity30 , 19 , and @entity36 and @entity34 , both 16 â € “ online fame and notoriety			1
but it all went horribly wrong when one bystander , who thought he was witnessing a genuine robbery , punched @entity34 in the face			1
the group uploaded the entire video , which also features several other fake thefts at @entity54 , to @entity55 , commenting that the purpose of the video was to see who would intervene to stop a robbery if they saw it happen right front of them			1
the group warned fans they got ' mixed results '			0
the clip has since gone viral , wracking up more than 450,000 views on @entity55			1
in the video 's first three ' robberies ' , things run to plan with bystanders rushing to help @entity30 , who has been brought to the ground by his friend			1
the boys then confess the prank and nobody is hurt			0
one bystander who comes to help even calls out to other people to call the police before being told it was a joke			1
but the boys ' luck soon runs out , and the last prank does not go quite as hoped			0
three men can be seen trying to help @entity30 after @entity34 pretends to rob him			0
a third man witnesses the scuffle , runs over and punches @entity34 in the face			0
at that point one of the boys screams : ' it 's a prank , it 's a prank , ' to stop the men			1
@entity34 then screams in pain , as other passers - by run to the scene			0
warning graphic video content @entity96 can be seen running at @entity30 at the start of the intended stunt			2
the group said they were shocked at how willing the public was to intervene takedown : the shocked man is dragged back towards the floor before he has time to realise what is happening @entity105 : within seconds men are running towards the scene to help the victim not impressed by the stunt , one of the men who intervened can be heard saying in the video : ' it 's not funny ' , followed by a ' sorry dude '			1
@entity114 rises from the ground and his injury is instantly clear as blood pours from his nose			0
he is then seen nursing his nose as blood continues to pour on the floor			0

he also said the reaction online to the stunt was not what was expected			2
' every single comment has been negative , saying how stupid we are , how dumb this prank is , ' he said			2
the bystanders who tried to help were shocked to learn it was a prank , but still helped @entity34 recover after he was punched ramifications : @entity30 said the group 's prank resulted in @entity114 ' nose being broken by the strangers punch ouch ! @entity34 was left with a gashed nose and seemed to be in a state of shock the reaction from bystanders was also unexpected , with @entity30 saying he anticipated nobody would be injured in the prank and nor did he expect people to get involved the way they did by trying to stop the ' robbery ' , thus demonstrating the purpose of the video			1
one bystander , 35 - year - old @entity155 rushed to help in what he thought was a real robbery			2
mr @entity155 said it was his natural reaction to help and he could not see what was funny about the stunt			2
' the first thing i felt was very angry , and i just felt it was a very silly prank			0
i was worried that this person could have been hurt or i could have been hurt			0
i was just furious and i just walked off			0
' a @entity167 spokeswoman advised people not to take part in any activity that could cause harm to themselves or others			0
' such activities can be highly dangerous and easily misconstrued by members of the public			0
in some cases , participation may also constitute a criminal offence , ' the spokeswoman said			0
the backlash has n't stopped the three boys from creating new videos			0
already a new clip of a fake fight has been uploaded to their @entity55 channel			1
while not everyone may agree with the group 's antics , they appear to be working , with more than 2000 subscribers to its @entity55 channel and @entity194 fan page .			1
