by @entity0 published : 01:00 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 17:14 est , 10 august 2013 infamous drug lord @entity1 walked free friday after 28 years in prison when a court overturned his 40 - year sentence for the 1985 kidnapping and killing of a @entity9 @entity8 agent , a brutal murder that marked a low point in @entity9 - @entity13 relations			1
the @entity9 @entity14 said friday it was extremely disappointed by the release of the man convicted in the killing of @entity8 agent @entity18 , calling it ' deeply troubling			1
' @entity13 ’s attorney general @entity20 said in a statement that he was ' worried ' about the court ’s decision , adding that his office is analyzing whether there are any charges pending against @entity1			1
released : drug kingpin @entity1 was released from prison today after a court ruled his 1985 murder conviction needed to be tossed out @entity1 , 60 , was a founding member of one of @entity13 ’s earliest and biggest drug cartels			1
the court ruled wednesday that he had been improperly tried in a federal court for a crime that should have been treated as a state offense			1
prison officials were notified of the ruling on thursday , and an official at the @entity40 state prosecutors ’ office said the drug lord left prison before dawn on friday			2
the official was not authorized to speak on the record			0
news media were not alerted until hours after the release , and @entity9 authorities apparently received no prior notification			0
' the @entity14 and the @entity8 learned today that early this morning @entity1 was released from prison , ' said @entity14 spokesman @entity51			1
the @entity8 , meanwhile , said it ' will vigorously continue its efforts to ensure @entity53 faces charges in the @entity9 for the crimes he committed			2
' @entity1 still faces charges in the @entity9 , but @entity13 ’s attorney general ’s office said it was unclear whether there was a current extradition request			1
hero : slain @entity8 agent @entity18 is considered amongst his colleagues to be an original hero in the war on drug cartels apparently , the @entity9 had requested his extradition for the @entity68 killing — something @entity1 ca n’t be tried twice for — but may not have filed extradition requests for pending @entity9 drug charges			1
the @entity9 @entity14 said it ' has continued to make clear to @entity13 authorities the continued interest of the @entity9 in securing @entity1 ’s extradition so that he might face justice in the @entity9			1
' @entity1 helped establish a powerful cartel based in the northwestern @entity13 state of @entity78 that later split into some of @entity13 ’s largest cartels , including the @entity78 and @entity82 cartels			1
he is still listed as one of the @entity8 ’s five top international fugitives , and @entity9 authorities believe he continued to control the laundering of drug money from behind bars			2
' @entity1 continues to launder the proceeds from narcotics trafficking and he maintains an alliance with drug trafficking organizations such as the @entity76 , most notably with @entity94 ’s network , ' said @entity96 spokesman @entity95 , referring to @entity97 , also known as ' @entity98 , ' or ' @entity99 ' because of the dark color of his skin , who is allegedly a top leader of the @entity76			2
28 years : @entity1 spent 28 years behind bars before he was released on a technicality friday morning in june , the @entity96 imposed sanctions against 18 people and 15 companies that allegedly moved money for @entity1			2
@entity1 has used a network of family members and front persons to invest his fortune into ostensibly legitimate companies and real estate projects in the city of @entity116 ' said @entity117 , director of @entity96 ’s @entity118			2
@entity1 has spent almost his entire sentence at a prison on the outskirts of that city , @entity13 ’s second - largest city			1
@entity13 ’s relations with @entity124 were badly damaged when @entity1 ordered @entity18 kidnapped , tortured and killed , purportedly because he was angry about a raid on a 220 - acre ( 89 - hectare ) marijuana plantation in central @entity13 named ' @entity127 ' — @entity128 — that was seized by @entity13 authorities at @entity18 ’s insistence			1
@entity18 was kidnapped on feb. 7 , 1985 , in @entity116 , a major drug trafficking center			1
his body and that of his @entity13 pilot , both showing signs of torture , were found a month later , buried in shallow graves			2
@entity9 officials accused their @entity13 counterparts of letting @entity18 ’s killers get away			1
@entity1 was eventually hunted down in @entity142			2
at one point , @entity144 agents almost blocked the @entity9 border with @entity13 , slowing incoming traffic to a standstill while conducting searches of all @entity13 trying to enter the @entity9			0
@entity18 ’s fellow @entity8 agents considered him a hero in the war against drug trafficking and the @entity154 , where @entity9 federal agencies collect information about @entity13 drug barons , is dedicated to him			1
times have changed since the low point , and cooperation has strengthened , but @entity1 ’s release friday reopened old wounds			0
prison : @entity1 spent the majority of his time behind bars at this prison in @entity116 @entity168 , the former @entity8 regional director for @entity13 at the time of the @entity68 killing who was present during the identification of the agent ’s body from dental records , said the release reflected a broader lack of cooperation with the @entity9 from the new @entity13 government , a contrast to the policy of former president @entity182			1
' you had a president that was working very close with our government in a quiet way			0
these people come in and so , boom , the curtain comes down , ' said @entity168 , now a private security consultant			0
' it means a disrespect for our government			0
' he said he was skeptical of the explanation that there was a justifiable legal rationale for @entity1 ’s release			0
' there ’s some collusion going on , ' he said			0
' this guy is a major trafficker			0
this guy is bad , a mean son of a gun			0
' @entity1 is said to have pioneered links between @entity208 cocaine cartels and the @entity13 smugglers who transport their drugs into the @entity9			1
the ruling left many wondering why it took so many years for judges to determine @entity1 was tried in the wrong court			2
' they were always '' political '' prisoners serving sentences for as long as the @entity9 kept up the pressure , ' said a former @entity8 official who once worked in @entity13			1
he is not authorized to talk about the case because he still does work in @entity13			2
road to freedom : @entity13 officials travel to the prison to inform @entity1 that he is to be released ' the bribe money to get them out was always there			1
@entity13 '' justice '' is always built on very weak foundations			0
and they seem to like it that way			0
sad , ' he added			0
@entity231 , a security expert at @entity13 ’s @entity232 , said the ruling may portend more such procedural rulings following the january freeing of @entity236 citizen @entity235 , who was convicted in @entity13 for being part of a kidnapping ring			1
the @entity236 served seven years of a 60 - year sentence before @entity13 ’s @entity240 voted 3 - 2 to release her in january because of procedural and rights violations during her arrest , including police staging a recreation of her capture for the media			0
' what appears to be coming is an avalanche of judicial appeals , with the drug traffickers hiring very good , very expensive lawyers , arguing there were violations of due process , ' said @entity231			0
' the government is going to have problems			0
' @entity13 courts and prosecutors have long tolerated illicit evidence such as forced confessions and have frequently based cases on questionable testimony or hearsay			0
such practices have been banned by recent judicial reforms , but past cases — including those against high - level drug traffickers — are often rife with such legal violations			0
' the government has to be prepared to keep an eye on judges so that they do n’t fall into the easy argument of due process , ' @entity231 said , ' because there may also be judges who are receiving money ' to accept such arguments .			0
