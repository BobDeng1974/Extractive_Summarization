the last time @entity0 faced @entity2 in a @entity4 semi-final , @entity1 ’s @entity0 surrendered meekly in a grim 4 - 1 reverse at @entity6			1
but that dark evening in february 2008 was very much par for the course amid a miserable era that saw @entity0 fans endure five defeats at that penultimate stage in four years			1
if @entity6 was a low , however , the @entity14 ’s misery in recent years has mainly occurred in mount @entity16			2
for the thousands heading down from the @entity18 , the road to @entity19 was paved with fears that would soon be well - founded			1
@entity0 boss @entity21 ( right ) and @entity22 pose with the @entity4 spirit - crushing defeats followed against @entity24 in the @entity25 in 2008 , while @entity26 dished out 4 - 1 and 4 - 0 thumpings in the last four of both competitions in 2011			1
even the serial @entity25 misfits of @entity30 conquered @entity0 in the competition ’s last four , 2 - 1 , in 2012			1
not since @entity32 and @entity34 ’s second - half goals in a @entity25 semi-final 2 - 1 win over @entity30 in april 2000 have @entity0 fans left the national stadium with anything to cheer about			1
after 15 long years , however , the @entity14 finally descends upon @entity19 today full of genuine optimism			2
for under @entity21 , @entity0 ’s status as lambs to the slaughter tag has been replaced by gleeful choruses of ‘ the sheep are on fire ’			1
exactly 12 months ago , that was the cry as @entity21 ended the @entity50 club ’s pitiful semi-final record , beating @entity51 4 - 0 in the @entity4 at @entity6 en - route to clinching the club ‘ s first silverware in 19 years in the final against @entity54 at @entity55			1
and although @entity57 gained their revenge at @entity59 in the @entity25 last four , @entity21 bellieves his side ’s efforts last year prove a watershed moment			1
‘ i thought @entity55 was a brilliant spectacle for last year ’s final , ’ said the @entity0 boss			1
‘ but you want a @entity19 final and it ’s great to have the final back being played there			2
@entity71 insists his @entity2 side must make amends for last term 's @entity4 anguish ‘ i ca n’t comment on previous teams but we ’ve done well in the cups			1
we ’ve got a big game on saturday but it ’s now second nature to the players and that ’s how it should be			2
‘ last season , there was an expectation to get that first trophy in almost 20 years			2
the desperation and need was there			2
and i think having handled that scenario is good			2
the players are now a year on , they ’ve handled a @entity95 campaign and come out with their head held high			2
‘ it ’s great to have that experience			2
but it does n’t give you any guarantees you ’ll win the game against a very good team like @entity2			1
‘ we ’re not in a @entity19 final yet but the plan is to go all the way			2
’ faced with great expectations and a team of perennial cup underachievers , @entity21 saw a need to diffuse tensions in his squad ahead of that @entity57 semi-final 12 months ago			1
the approach would lay foundations for a challenge to champions @entity26 in this season ’s @entity117			0
‘ there was no fancy hotel , no going away - we treated it like it was just another game , ’ he recalled			1
injured @entity0 ace @entity123 lifts the @entity4 trophy last year ‘ playing for @entity0 , with all the expectation , if you win a few games people can get carried away and when you lose people are falling over themselves with frustration			1
‘ it ’s about keeping the players right and being professional at all times			0
we ca n’t affect how supporters view us			0
but we can affect how we work monday to friday			0
‘ so for that semi we just kept preparations the same as they would be for a league game			0
we do that for every game now			0
‘ whether it ’s on the back of a good or bad result , monday morning is the same at training			0
if we have to address things from the weekend we do that but then we move on			0
‘ i think that approach is reflected in our ( consistent ) results recently			0
we ’ve gone 10 games unbeaten , with eight wins and eight clean sheets in there			0
‘ and even when we ’ve not been at our best , we ’ve still got results			0
there ’s a lot to be pleased about			0
@entity123 wheels away in celebration after scoring against @entity54 in september ‘ when i came here , i wanted us to compete quickly and get a team on the pitch that was respected in @entity161 again			0
it pleases me no end that we are that team at the minute			0
but we have to keep trying to build on it as more will be expected as we go along			0
’ @entity21 has a good record against @entity2 - played six , won four , drawn one , lost one			1
but the solitary defeat , an opening day 3 - 0 loss to @entity71 ’s side at @entity50 on the opening day of the season , prompts a bout of introspection			1
‘ there were reasons for it , ’ he said			0
‘ i did n’t help the players that day , if i ’m honest			0
i picked the wrong team after our exploits on the thursday night in @entity182 against @entity183			0
‘ that ’s no slight on @entity2 , by the way , because hands - down they deserved to win			1
our performance was not good enough and we got punished			0
‘ that defeat to @entity2 at the start of the season is perhaps a good message for us ahead of this weekend - that records , experience and good players count for nothing			1
it ’s good performances that help you win games			0

@entity0 face @entity2 in the @entity4 semi-finals
last time these sides met at this stage , @entity0 were beaten 4 - 1 in 2008
but @entity21 insists his side will not suffer same fate in 2015
