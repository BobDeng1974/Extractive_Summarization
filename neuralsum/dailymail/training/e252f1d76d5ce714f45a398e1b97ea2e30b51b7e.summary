under fire : @entity1 , pictured on the campaign trail in @entity23 , @entity11 , yesterday , is facing questions that he may have ignored child labour laws by allowing his daughter to work as a church janitor when she was 13 ' actually proud ' : @entity12 carried out janitorial work at the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , as a teenager in the 1980s but federal child labour laws in effect today and during the 1980s specify that children are not allowed to hold such cleaning jobs , and that there are no exceptions made for places of worship			1
@entity40 , of @entity41 , told @entity42 : ' i definitely see it as a child labour violation			2
when you put a kid in a situation that 's designed for adults you 're asking for trouble			2
' the law only permits 13 - year - olds to deliver newspapers ; babysit ; work in a business solely owned or operated by their parents ; and work as an actor or performer in film , tv , theatre or radio			1
@entity1 's second wife claims she could end his presidential campaign with an explosive television interview , it emerged today			2
@entity68 , who was married to the @entity2 candidate from 1981 to 2000 , has recorded an interview with @entity71			2
no details of what @entity68 actually told @entity71 have yet been made public , but the apparent debate within the network as to when the interview should be aired suggests that her views will be controversial			2
but the network is debating when to show the interview amid fears it could be seen as biased if it contributes to wrecking mr @entity1 's election prospects			2
@entity1 and @entity68 were married from 1981 to 2000 , after he divorced his first wife @entity82 and before his marriage to @entity84 , a fixture on the campaign trail			0

he said : ' they 'd be getting money , which is a good thing if you 're poor			0
only the elites despise earning money			0
' ' i â€™m going to continue to find ways to help poor people learn how to get a job , learn how to get a better job and learn someday to own the job , ' he added			1
in december , the former @entity30 lawmaker had told a crowd in @entity105 , @entity106 , that children in poor neighbourhoods have ' no habits of working and nobody around them who works '			1

but professor @entity123 , of @entity124 and the author of @entity126 : an @entity127 , told @entity42 : ' substitution of child labour for adult labour is never an economic bargain			0
' not only are adults with full - time jobs earning living wages displaced by kids with part - time jobs earning minimum wages , but the competition between children and adults will also depress the wages of those adults who hold on to their jobs			1
' sticking to his guns : mr @entity1 is a staunch opponent of the current child labour laws , describing the legislation as ' stupid ' candidate : mr @entity1 waves to supporters as he arrives for a town hall meeting with his wife @entity84 at @entity154 's bbq in @entity155 , @entity11 , yesterday he added : ' poor kids do need this kind of opportunity , but i 'm not sure janitorial service is the ticket			0

recalling her time as a janitor , his daughter @entity82 today said : ' i was actually proud of my clean bathrooms			1
i learned work has value			0
