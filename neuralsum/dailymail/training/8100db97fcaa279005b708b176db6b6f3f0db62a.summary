there are few places in @entity2 you could take these spectacular images - the iridescent colours of the @entity6 illuminating the night sky			2
but one photographer has found a perfect spot to capture the constellations in stunning definition - the pitch - black countryside of the @entity13			2
astro - photographer @entity14 , 35 , has been taking pictures of the phenomenon in locations across the island over the past 18 months			1
it contains between 100billion and 400billion stars but can not be distinguished properly with the naked eye			1
mr @entity14 said : ‘ i have always been interested in the night sky and wanted to try something different with my camera			2
‘ @entity57 was the way to go			0
the pictures were all taken on the @entity13 over the last 12 to 18 months			0
it ’s turned into a bit of a labour of love			0
illuminating the night sky : @entity64 , which is the oldest lighthouse on the island - and is said to have been built in 1328 on the lookout : @entity68 ( left ) , built near the @entity64 ; and a view from @entity70 , south - west of @entity71 ( right ) things are looking up : galactic hunters chasing the @entity6 capture another couple of stargazers on the @entity13 colourful stars : @entity78 steps used for many years - but shut to the public due to recent landslips ( left ) , and hay bales in a field ( right ) ‘ the @entity13 is very good for astro - photography due to the little light pollution on the south coast of the island			1
’ in what looks like a rainbow of stars arched across the night sky , one photograph shows the glowing band looming over @entity64 on the southerly tip of the island			0
another depicts @entity21 station below an explosion of luminous colours			0
according to mr @entity14 , a former @entity100 from the @entity13 , most of his shots are taken using a @entity102 camera over a 30 - second period with very high @entity104 - light sensitivity - levels to capture the @entity6 , which is just visible with the naked eye			1
mr @entity14 said low light pollution is crucial to capturing the galaxy on camera			1
he said : ‘ i have been very interested in taking photos of the @entity6 over the last two years			0
‘ the light pollution on the @entity13 allows me to pull as much possible light into the camera to capture the billions of stars in the galaxy			1
it ’s a truly astounding phenomenon			0
' i would like to travel to the @entity115 in the future to capture the @entity6 at its very best as there is very little light pollution			2

astro - photographer @entity14 says @entity13 countryside is best place to capture constellations
idyllic island is known for its low levels of light pollution and is hotspot for stargazers to capture galaxy
@entity6 contains between 100 and 400billion stars but can not be distinguished properly with naked eye
