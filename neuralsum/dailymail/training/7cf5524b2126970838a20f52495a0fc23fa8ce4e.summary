@entity0 has been accused of ' stigmatising mental illness ' for naming a @entity3 attraction @entity4			1
campaigners say bosses at the theme park should consider changing the name of the horror maze			1
the attraction has featured as part of the @entity14 park 's annual @entity3 event , @entity15 , for eight years			2
@entity0 , in @entity14 , said @entity4 attraction has been part of its @entity15 events for eight years campaigners want the name of the @entity3 attraction changed and say it ' stigmatises ' the mentally ill mental health advocates said that having actors chasing people around ' @entity4 ' pretending to be patients reinforces stigma around mental illness			1
a @entity0 spokeswoman said that the attraction is not meant to be offensive nor ' a realistic portrayal ' of mental ill health			1
the news sparked a row on the attraction 's @entity36 page , with one user posting : ' i have psychosis , i 'm not dangerous , and have never run after someone with a chainsaw			0
' another said : ' stuff like this genuinely contributes to an atmosphere in which people with mental illness suffer discrimination and violence			2
' to which one user replied : ' obfuscation in discussing mental illness is equally damaging			0
do you seriously believe that your bracketing all people who have mental illnesses ( of a variety of kinds ) under the " offended " flag because of the use of the name " asylum " is n't offensive ? ' another added : ' it 's for @entity3 , get a grip			1
' the petition organised by nursing student @entity68 has attracted hundreds of signatures a petition calling for the ride to be shut down organised by @entity68 , a mental health nursing student , has attracted more than 750 signatures			1
she wrote : ' asylum , @entity0 's @entity3 maze , is stigmatising to mental illness			1
' @entity78 , chief executive of the charity @entity79 , said : ' while of course there 's nothing wrong with a bit of @entity3 fun , explicit references to " patients " crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness			2
' it really matters because the promotion of the scary " mental patient " stereotype reinforces stigma and means people with mental health problems are afraid to be open about it			1
this means they are less likely to get support both from friends and professionals			0
' we 'd like executives from @entity0 to meet face - to - face with people with mental illness , to hear about their concerns			2
we also think they should change the theme of the attraction and stop referring to " patients "			0
there are plenty of other themes they could choose like zombies , vampires or monsters , without upsetting anyone			0
' @entity0 bosses say the maze is for adults and the experience draws on classic horror film content a @entity0 spokeswoman said : ' we have listened to the feedback and respect the opinions of everyone who has been in touch			1
however , these comments are not universally representative either of many of our guests who have given us very positive feedback , or of others working within the mental health sector			2
' the maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping			0
it is set within a single closed environment and is a very small element of an event aimed at adult visitors - all of whom chose to visit , and have paid for entry to the overall event			0
' this maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content			0
it is not intended , nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it , to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of mental health or indeed any other institution			1
' last month supermarkets @entity162 and @entity163 came under fire for selling @entity3 costumes which were said to have caused offence			0
@entity162 withdrew its ' mental patient fancy dress costume ' and @entity163 took its ' psycho ward ' outfit off the shelves .			0

hundreds of people signed petition against @entity3 horror maze
campaigners want bosses to consider changing the name from the asylum
but @entity0 says the ' adult ' attraction is not intended as ' realistic portrayal ' of mental health or institutions
