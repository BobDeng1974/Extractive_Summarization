by @entity0 published : 13:10 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 16:50 est , 14 february 2013 this huge litter of cute piglets shocked keepers at an activity farm after they were all born to one sow			0
@entity6 had been expecting @entity7 the @entity9 pig to have only four babies in her first litter			1
they arrived for work in the morning to find the one - year - old mum had given birth to 11 of the adorable piglets without any help			2
@entity7 the @entity9 pig was expected to have between four and eight babies but the sow had 11 piglets , pictured here but there is little chance of rest for overworked @entity7 who now has her hands full feeding the huge litter at the @entity26 's @entity25 , near @entity27 , @entity28			1
@entity9 pigs are the smallest domesticated breed in the world , originally come from @entity32 , and have an average of six to eight piglets at a time			2
it is not unheard of for a pig to have more in their first litter but because @entity7 is very small staff expected fewer babies			1
new mother @entity7 has her hands full feeding the litter of 11 hungry piglets the 11 brothers and sisters all sleep on top of one another to conserve body heat @entity49 , co-owner of @entity26 's , said : ' we expected her to have between four and eight piglets because she is so tiny			1
' @entity7 is about half the size of the other @entity9 pigs we have had here so we really did n't expect her to have so many , it was a bit of a surprise			1
one of the 11 piglets born to @entity7 in one sitting ' she managed to do it overnight without any help			1
' she is having lots of food to give her enough energy to feed the piglets and has her own separate compartment to sleep in so she can have some rest , which the piglets can access			0
' the piglets sleep on top of each other to conserve body heat which is very cute			0
we are planning to keep them until the summer and then we will sell some of them			0
' it is thought that @entity9 pigs were brought to @entity32 in the 19th century by whalers and were swapped for goods with the @entity80 people			2
the name ' @entity9 ' was given to the hairy pigs by the indigenous tribes , which translates to ' fat and round '			0
the animals were on the brink of extinction in the 1970s until a conservation programme was put in place			0
kunekunes were imported to @entity92 in 1992 when horse rider @entity93 and @entity94 heard about their endangered status and began breeding them from the @entity92 .			0

@entity7 , a @entity9 pig from @entity28 gave birth to 11 piglets in one sitting
the brave mother managed the task overnight and without any help
@entity7 's small size meant her owners thought she would only have four babies
