by @entity0 published : 20:26 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 8 november 2013 writer @entity0 was cynical when he joined a speed awareness course - but emerged a convert ' and i hope we never get to meet again , ’ says @entity4 , as he puts the top back on his red marker pen and prepares to leave the room			1
there ’s an uneasy silence			2
we get what he means , but most of us would be only too pleased to see him again , albeit in different circumstances			2
we ’ve been in his company for the past four hours because we ’ve strayed from the rules of the @entity17 , and now we want to thank this shirt - sleeved saviour who has shepherded us back to the path of motoring righteousness			1
‘ that was absolutely fascinating , @entity4 , and sobering , too , ’ i tell him as we shake hands by the vending machine			2
certainly , my attitude is light years from how it was at 12.15pm when i walked into a dreary office building on @entity30 ’s dreary @entity29 on a dreary tuesday			2
there were 24 of us gathered as our names were ticked off by a woman carrying a clipboard and a knowing expression			2
we had paid £ 97 each to attend one of the @entity38 ’s @entity37 , a relatively small sum compared with the prospects of an ‘ @entity42 ’ endorsement and three points on our licence			1
in my case that would have meant a tally of 12 and six months or so on the buses			2
all my points have been for speeding			1
on this occasion i had been doing 38mph in a 30mph limit , hardly criminal i told myself , as we shuffled into the room			1
then , to my horror , i found myself sitting slap bang in the middle of the front row			0
at the very least , my idea had been to spend the afternoon doodling at the back of the class or writing my @entity63 card list			0
i glanced at my fellow naughty speeders			0
some attendees on the course , led by a tutor named @entity4 , did not know the national speed limit of 60mph we were a cosmopolitan bunch of all ages			1
one woman arrived with her weekly @entity74 ’s shop			0
the man across the aisle from me was wearing a thick coat and bobble hat which he kept on throughout the session despite it being an overheated room			0
some of us had taken our driving tests only a few years ago ; others , like me , have been behind the wheel four decades or more , during which the rules of the road have changed somewhat — as i was about to discover			0
‘ my name ’s @entity4 and i am not a policeman , ’ he began			0
‘ now let ’s face it , you do n’t really want to be here but let ’s all try to get on and , who knows , you might find some of it interesting			0
’ shortly after the off , he asked us to jot down the speed limits for urban areas , rural single carriageways , dual carriageways and motorways			1
i was sure the country roads limit was 70mph			1
i always understood the round white signs with a black diagonal line through them that you see on leaving a village mean you can go pretty much as fast as you like			0
more than half of the 1,754 people who died on the roads last year were driving on rural roads the correct answer was 60mph			1
hardly anyone scored top marks			0
‘ perhaps we should re-read the @entity17 from time to time , ’ said @entity4			0
’ @entity4 was never patronising or judgmental , always polite and good - humoured			1
he told us that if a pedestrian is hit at 20mph the survival rate is almost 98 per cent , whereas if they are hit at 40mph the chances of survival drop to just 10 per cent			1
writer @entity0 : ' i no longer think of speed cameras as cash dispensers for local authorities ' he then ventured that if he were @entity127 he would be keen for all drivers to attend a speed awareness course every ten years or so as a ‘ refresher ’			1
‘ i ’d vote for you , ’ said a woman by the window			0
‘ me , too , ’ said a self - confessed @entity134			1
learner drivers should have to attend one of these classes before taking their tests , and fines for speeding should be far higher than for a parking ticket			1
there is no excuse for speeding , just as there is no excuse for texting at the wheel			1
oh yes , i ’m filled with the zeal and intolerance of the newly converted			0
i have been a speedy driver most of my life — but not because i get a thrill from it			0
i speed because i am impatient and am often running late			1
i speed because my main thoughts when driving are about myself rather than the safety of anyone else			1
@entity4 has n’t just cut my speed , he ’s also increased my awareness of others			1
yesterday , as my wife entered a 40mph zone in @entity162 , i suggested she should drive in either second or third gear so that the noise of the engine would remind her of the limit — a tip @entity4 had passed on			1
and , then , when she was preparing to turn right off a single lane across traffic i said she should not turn the wheels until she knew it was safe to make the manoeuvre			0
as @entity4 had pointed out , ‘ if you do and someone shunts you from behind then you ’ll end up being pushed into the oncoming traffic ’			0
last year , 1,754 people died on the roads , the lowest figure since records began in 1926			1
sixty per cent of those died in accidents on rural roads , 34 per cent in towns and villages and only 6 per cent on motorways			1
with the help of powerpoint slides , still photography and live footage of cars braking at various speeds , @entity4 was winning over his audience			0
toot - toot ! @entity0 was more like mr @entity193 from @entity194 , played here by @entity196 he did n’t go out of his way to shock — although there was an audible gasp when he showed a crushed child ’s bike under the wheel of a car following an accident in @entity205 , @entity30			1
‘ what happened to the child ? ’ asked a woman near the back			0
‘ she died , i ’m afraid			1
’ ‘ oh ... ’ said the woman , her voice breaking			0
‘ i have a young daughter and i ’m finding this uncomfortable			0
can we move on ? ’ there were several more gasps when we saw a detailed reconstruction of the worst motorway crash ever in @entity218			1
it involved 51 vehicles on the eastbound carriageway of the @entity222 near junction 14 in march 1991			1
no one was speeding , but several cars were going far too fast in the dense fog			2
ten died and more than 25 were injured			2
such was the carnage that the @entity222 was closed for four days while the wreckage was removed and the road repaved			0
what has amazed me since last week is how i no longer see speed cameras as the enemy			2
and i no longer think of them as cash dispensers for local authorities trying to balance the books			0
‘ how many speed cameras are there in @entity30 within the @entity239 ? ’ @entity4 had asked us			2
‘ about 5,000 , ’ i said			0
‘ no , more than that , ’ said the @entity74 ’s shopper			0
‘ the answer is 692 , actually , and only about a quarter of those will be active at any one time , ’ said @entity4 , who went on to explain the strict criteria that allows a camera to be installed in the first place			0
@entity249 of the list is that three people need to have been killed or seriously injured within half a mile of the allotted stretch of road in a 36 - month period			1
in addition , 20 per cent of vehicles have to be travelling at above the speed limit for 28 consecutive days			1
some crashes , such as this one on the @entity259 in @entity260 in september , are caused by drivers not paying enough attention to weather conditions such as fog			2
another such crash on the @entity222 in 1991 killed 10 what this means is that a speed camera immediately tells you there has been a history of accidents , possibly some fatal			1
you can rail against them all you want , but you ’ll never feel the pain as much as the mother or father , wife or husband of those who have died as a result of someone going too fast			2
frankly , it appalls me that my son , who passed his test last month and who has inherited the impatience of his father , is driving around without attending one of these courses			2
and it ’s ludicrous that new drivers can pass their tests without ever driving on a motorway			2
this week , the skills minister @entity296 said that driving tests should have a distinction grade — rather than just a pass or a fail — to improve road safety because insurers would offer cheaper premiums to those who pass with flying colours			0
this seems to me an excellent idea			0
i also welcome the news that the government is considering raising the driving age to 18 from 17			0
just as drink driving and the whole notion of ‘ one for the road ’ is now regarded as indefensible , so , too , speeding should be seen as beyond the pale in a civilised society			2
just a thought , as @entity4 would say .			0

courses cost £ 97 but most drivers take them to avoid speeding points
more than 1,700 people died on @entity218 *'s* roads last year - fewest since 1926
worst - ever crash in 1991 killed 10 , even though none broke speed limit
