by @entity0 @entity2 and @entity3 pop star @entity1 has hit out at @entity4 for her new contract with @entity6 , accusing her of bowing to ' white people companies '			1
in an angry tweet directed at the 12 years a slave star , she wrote : ' oh @ @entity10 cl n't talk abt the bleaching creams white people ( companies ) make cuz the white man pays her , they own her ! ! [ sic ] '			0
the comment comes just a month after @entity16 mentioned @entity1 - who has been accused of marketing her own brand of skin - bleaching cream called @entity19 - in a speech about learning to value the color of her own skin			1
' when you take that picture and you put a picture of @entity43 darker , this is what you 're telling people - the product really works , ' she said			2
' and guess what ? people really want to buy it			0
it 's what it is			0
i do n't really care			0
' given her defiant and hypocritical attitude , it 's no surprise the fiery singer was angered when miss @entity4 called her out in a speech at @entity59 's @entity58 in @entity61 event on february 27			1
influential : in a recent speech , miss @entity4 read out loud a letter from a fan who said she decided not to buy @entity43 's skin - whitening cream @entity67 because the actress had inspired her to love her own skin on - screen : miss @entity4 won an @entity71 for best supporting actress for her role in 2013 film 12 years a slave in her talk , the 30 - year - old opened up about how conventional standards of beauty once affected her self - esteem , reading aloud a letter written to her by a young girl who viewed her as a role model			1
' @entity84 , ' reads the letter			0
' i think you 're really lucky to be this black but yet this successful in @entity61 overnight			0
i was just about to buy @entity43 's @entity19 cream to lighten my skin when you appeared on the world map and saved me			1
' ' my heart bled a little when i read those words , ' the actress said through tears , explaining how as a child , she , too , would pray that she 'd one day wake up with lighter skin			0
hypocritical : @entity43 is no stranger to controversy ; in a february interview with @entity35 , she essentially admitted that @entity19 is intended as a skin - lightener , not as a cure for dark spots as it claims perpetuating the problem : ' when you take that picture and you put a picture of @entity43 darker , this is what you 're telling people - the product really works , ' she said			1
' and guess what ? people really want to buy it ' but while the actress saw the letter as a source of inspiration , @entity1 took it as a personal attack			2
after her angry tweet at @entity123 , criticism poured in , with one person tweeting : ' b * * * * lupita is the new face of @entity6 ! ! she wins ! ! and you 're just @entity129 [ sic ] '			0
in her response , @entity1 said of the cosmetics company : ' but they sell bleaching cream tho [ sic ] '			1
the pop star is likely referring to @entity6 's @entity135 range of cosmetics , which are actually advertised as ' brighteners ' that ' regulate melanin production and awaken the luminosity of the skin '			2
and as far as @entity43 's claim that @entity6 is a ' white people company ' , a quick perusal of the website reveals that it has a number of concealers and foundations in darker skin tones .			2

@entity1 's comment is hypocritical considering she recently *courted* controversy for marketing ' dark spot *remover* ' @entity19 , which is *frequently* used as a skin - whitening cream
