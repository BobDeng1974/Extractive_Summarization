no matter how brutal their crimes , most @entity1 death row inmates are given their choice of a last meal and while some ask for typical fare , others leap at the last chance for indulgence			1
while the recent execution of @entity1 murderer @entity16 made headlines last week for its controversial use of a new drug , his choice of a box of chocolates and a tub of ice cream would n’t strike anyone as ill advised			2
while decadent choices are the norm , other inmates — including one very notable female killer — opt for more @entity26 last meals			2
indulgent : rapist and murder @entity16 , @entity1 's most recently executed inmate , made headlines when the state chose to use a new drug to do the job called midazolam			2
also notable was his choice of a box of chocolates and a tub of chocolate ice cream as his last meal before @entity40 was put to death in 2006 , he requested some foods true to his southern locale , reports the @entity44			0
a deep fried feast of fried catfish , fried green tomatoes , fried eggplant , and hush puppies were laid out for him before his lethal injection			1
@entity51 washed it down with sweet tea			0
@entity54 , an attempted bank robber and cop killer , asked for tacos			0
so did @entity57 , who murdered the owner of a @entity60 strip club while he and accomplices robbed it			0
@entity63 , who raped and murdered an @entity65 woman and her two teen daughters after they asked him for directions in 1989 , asked for salami sandwiches and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich			0
simple : when @entity63 was about to be put to death for raping and murdering a woman and her teen daughters in 1989 , he chose to eat salami sandwiches on white bread and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich wasted : killer @entity78 's execution was notable for two reasons -- one , he was the first person executed after the @entity81 lifted the ban on capital punishment , and two , he was drunk when it happened			2
@entity1 has since banned alcohol as part of the last meal deep fried : the @entity40 killer @entity51 stayed true to his deep south locale when he asked for fried catfish , fried green tomatoes , fried eggplant , hush puppies , and sweet tea @entity78 got a special treat at his 1979 execution			1
not only was he the first in @entity1 to be put to death following the @entity81 ’s reinstatement of the death penalty , but he also got to split a flask of @entity102 whiskey with the prison superintendent			1
@entity105 ’ seven - man killing spree was immortalized in the 2003 film monster , but her life came to an end the year before			0
she declined a last meal and instead drank just a cup of coffee nine hours before she was put to death			2
taking the opposite route was @entity113 , who murdered a pregnant woman in 1982 along with her two young daughters			0
he chose to have a smorgasbord of lobster tail , fried potatoes , a half - pound of fried shrimp , six ounces of fried clam strips , half a loaf of garlic bread and 32 ounces of @entity124 root beer			2
restrictions : @entity1 now limits last meals to $ 40 each			1
they must be prepared at the prison and the food must be purchased locally crunchy or soft ? though @entity57 killed a man in a strip club , he did not ask for buffet cocktail wieners			1
instead , he chose tacos			0
@entity54 , a cop killer and attempted bank robber , also chose the @entity138 dish @entity113 's execution became infamous when the state 's brand new electric chair after retiring ' @entity142 ' caused him to scream and bleed from the nose			0
his meal of a lobster tail , a half - pound of fried shrimp , six ounces of fried clam strips , garlic bread and 32 ounces of @entity124 root beer was also conspicuous famous : @entity105 , whose wild murder spree became the @entity153 film monster , declined a last meal and had only a cup of coffee 9 hours prior to her 2002 execution in addition to the extravagance of his meal , @entity113 ’ execution became well known its goriness after the killer convulsed and screamed as blood gushed from his nose			1
@entity113 ’ was the first execution that utilized @entity1 ’s new electric chair in 1999 , which replaced the rickety oak ‘ @entity171 ’ chair that had been in use since 1924			0
all inmates in @entity1 must request their last meal ahead of time and each meal must be prepared in the prison			1
that means no fast food			0
extravagance is now also frowned upon and meals may not cost in excess of $ 40			1
no booze has been allowed since @entity78 ’s indulgence with the superintendent			0
inmates must eat their meals , according to the state ’s @entity187 , from a tray and , oddly enough , with a spork			1
multipurpose : regardless of what @entity1 inmates choose for their last meal , they all get sporks to eat it with			1

from lobster tails to fried green tomatoes to a simple cup of coffee , the last meal requests of @entity1 inmates are *unpredictable* and *varied*
everyone gets a last meal , but it ca *n't* cost more than $ 40 , must be prepared in the prison , and must be purchased locally
to eat their meals , inmates are given a spork
