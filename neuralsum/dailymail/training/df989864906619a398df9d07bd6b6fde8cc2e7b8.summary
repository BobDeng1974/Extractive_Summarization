by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:37 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 16:49 est , 8 november 2012 despite seeing the defeat of his favoured candidate @entity3 , @entity3 has refused to exit the political fray since tuesday 's election			2
his latest sally today was an attack on @entity10 , the @entity11 host who caused a controversy on tuesday night when he said he was ' so glad ' @entity13 had hit the @entity15 coast and allowed @entity16 to be re-elected			1
the eccentric tycoon tweeted that ' @entity11 should fire him immediately ' , adding : ' tweet me back if u think we should start a petition to fire @ hardball_chris for his comments on @entity13 & the death & destruction it caused			1
' outspoken : @entity3 has been very active on @entity27 since seeing his side lose the election @entity10 the outspoken and forthright host of @entity11 ' @entity31 ' caused outrage during @entity34 coverage by saying he was ' so glad ' superstorm @entity13 aided president @entity16 's re-election @entity3 has been particularly active on @entity27 since @entity16 's re-election was confirmed , writing that the result was ' a total sham and a travesty ' as he argued , ' our country is now in serious and unprecedented trouble			1
' after his comments were denounced by @entity44 , he flew into a rage at the @entity47 anchor , tweeting : ' would n't you love to have my ratings ? ' the star of @entity52 was a strong supporter of @entity3 - and the relationship between the two men has been blamed by some for leading to the candidate 's landslide defeat			0
@entity10 ' comments had earlier been greeted with outrage by @entity60 and independents on @entity27			1
assault : @entity3 called for @entity10 to be fired over his controversial televised comments ' what kind of sicko says they 're so happy we had that hurricane last week ? seriously @entity10 is beyond revolting , ' tweeted ' @entity69 '			1
others were more level headed in their criticism , with @entity73 taking to the social networking site to say that , ' no amount of political points are worth even one life lost			0
' another @entity27 user called ' @entity79 ' called @entity10 ' a disgusting excuse for a person ' , while ' @entity82 ' said that he was ' a disgrace to humanity			1
' even in the @entity11 studio , where he was on a panel including @entity88 , @entity10 ' comments caused an audible ' oooo ' , leading him to raise his hand to explain			1
@entity27 was awash with outrage from members of the public upset with @entity10 comments regarding superstorm @entity13 the @entity11 host claimed that he was happy that @entity13 had occurred because it gave president @entity16 a much needed boost in the polls the 66 - year - old news anchor clarified his comments on air as politically speaking - but the damage was already done ' no , politically i should say - not in terms of hurting people , ' explained a backtracking @entity10			1
' the storm brought in possibilities for good politics			2
' despite hailing the storm - of - a - lifetime for aiding the re-election of president @entity16 at the expense of @entity3 , the controversial @entity11 host took to @entity27 where he clarified his statement			1
' to clarify - i was thrilled at the cooperation between the president and state officials that made the country proud			0
great bipartisanship , ' he tweeted			0
' obviously i was n't talking about the horror of the storm			2
i grew up on the @entity124 , ' @entity10 wrote			1
commander in chief : president @entity16 ( left ) hugs marine owner @entity127 ( right ) during a tour of @entity129 , @entity130 , which was badly affected by @entity13 devastation : waves break in front of a destroyed amusement park wrecked by @entity135 , @entity130 aerial view : @entity135 , @entity130 , was surrounded by water after @entity13 lashed the @entity138 the death toll from @entity13 has already exceeded 100 and many who were in the path of the storm in @entity130 and @entity143 lost their property and were forced into emergency shelter - which some are still relying on			2
the massive weather system also caused mayhem on @entity34 , with many voting districts and precincts facing power outages , fuel shortages and some had to light up their polling places with flares in the dark			0
indeed , findings from the @entity158 's election weekend survey in the aftermath of the storm said that president @entity16 held a 48 - percent to 45 - percent lead over @entity3 among those likely to vote			1
this was compared to a week before the storm which had each candidate level on 47 per cent of the likely vote			1
the respected center polled 2,709 likely voters from october 31st to november 3rd in their final pre-election survey while the previous survey dated from october 24th to 28th			0
non-partisan pals : @entity170 , known to be a longtime critic of @entity16 , put those differences aside on when he guided the president on a tour of damaged areas of @entity130 up in the air : the @entity178 helicopter , carrying president @entity16 and @entity130 governor @entity170 , took an aerial tour of the @entity138 in @entity130 destroyed : homes were wrecked by flooding from @entity13 , pictured on in @entity182 , @entity130 in fact according to @entity158 , 69 per cent of all likely voters approved of the way president @entity16 handled the storm 's impact and 46 per cent of @entity3 's supporters did too			2
more importantly for president @entity16 , 63 per cent of swing voters looked favourably on his handling of the storm and its effects			2
analysts said that the storm boosted @entity16 's image among voters by visibly allowing him to show a bipartisan side			2
his rapprochement with @entity130 governor @entity170 and the manner in which he was publicly thanked by one of his fiercest critics was seen as damaging to @entity3			0
this was especially the case as @entity170 had been the keynote speaker at the @entity203 and had been one of @entity3 's most vocal supporters			0
praise from @entity10 : @entity203 presidential candidate and former @entity208 gov. @entity3 gives his concession speech in @entity210 last night but , even before his massively controversial comments last night , @entity10 had been ruffling feathers with his forthright political opinions during early @entity34 coverage			1
one of his first targets were @entity216 who do not vote - describing them as idiots , before attacking those who vote for third party candidates			0
' if you have n't voted , i do n't want to talk to you , ' said @entity10 earlier in his broadcast			2
' and if you vote for one of these numbskull third or fourth party candidates like @entity225 or @entity226 and then you go " oh , i was surprised by what happened , " well , you should n't be			0
' because idiots like you voted for a third or fourth party candidate and they do n't know how how the system works : two choices			0
' president @entity16 speaks at his election night party last night in @entity234 indeed , @entity10 capped off a memorable evening for himself by praising @entity3 's concession speech instead of attacking president @entity16 's victory one			1
' i mean , i thought @entity3 ’s speech last night was a piece of wonder , ' said @entity10			1
' i thought the way he came out alone and stood in one , as they say on @entity243 , right out there by himself — not with the wife , with the shoulder to cry on or any of that — stood out there with manliness and grace , and did absolutely everything right			0
‘ ' " i called the president			0
" this is out of the book			0
this is how you do it ; it ’s biblical			0
and every single thing was classic , perfect			0

@entity10 said ' i *'m* so glad we had that storm last week ' on election night
