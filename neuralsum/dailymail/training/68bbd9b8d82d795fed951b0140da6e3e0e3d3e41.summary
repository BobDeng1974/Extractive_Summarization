@entity2 singled out @entity0 for praise in an interview he gave to @entity9 ’s in - house television station earlier this week , saying : ‘ he phoned me not so long ago			1
i think he is one of the promising managers in the game			2
the job he has done at @entity1 has been fantastic			1
’ @entity0 , who has known @entity2 ’s son @entity14 since his playing days , admitted that he has been speaking to the former @entity16 boss ‘ on and off for a few years ’ but was happy to keep it confidential			1
@entity0 and @entity1 are yet to win a @entity5 game this season the 43 - year - old has yet to win a game in the @entity5 since leading @entity1 to promotion last season , but hopes that @entity2 ’s input can make a difference			1
and he said : ‘ there are a number of people i speak to and he is one of them			2
he is obviously a very important figure and always gives you really good , honest , helpful advice – no holds barred reality as he sees it , and he has been very good to me like that			2
‘ the last time i spoke to him , i said : “ can you win me a game now ! ”			1
sir @entity2 has spoken out in support of @entity0 in a recent interview on @entity40 ' more or less whenever i ’ve needed it he has answered the call			1
he has always got time for you			2
he was like that when he was active as well , not just because he has retired			2
when he was manager he always took a phone call and always gave you sound advice			1
‘ he has experienced virtually everything in the football world and i ask him advice and pick his brains			2
it ’s great that he thinks that i talk a bit of sense and try and get the best out of what we have			0
' he had to do that himself many moons ago			0
it was n’t an easy pathway and i do n’t think there is one in football management to be honest			0
@entity0 is friends with sir @entity2 's son , @entity14 ‘ there are certain people in the game you gravitate towards for an opinion			1
i am aware that you need that and he is one of them and he has been very helpful for me and honest with any view i have asked him about			0
‘ sometimes i touch on many different challenges			0
as you can imagine he does n’t beat about the bush			0
‘ i also speak to @entity14			1
me and @entity14 get on well and have done for a number of years			1
he almost signed for @entity78 as a kid when i was there so we have known each other for a long time			0
’ @entity0 is still adapting to life as a @entity5 manager			1
only this week , a photo was posted online of him travelling on the tube to the leaders in sport business summit at @entity90			0
@entity0 made the trip to the @entity92 by @entity87 he added : ‘ i was on the @entity87 and a young man said hello			1
i could see him and i just laughed , although the grimace picture looks more me			0
i was aware of him			0
i ’m just a bloke you know but it was one of those funny little quirks			0
‘ there is a big profile difference , of course			0
it was slightly building last year because of what we did and all the players have noticed it			0
‘ at the golf club where i live , it ’s amazing the people who say ‘ @entity109 ’			0
