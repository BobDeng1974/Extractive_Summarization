by @entity1 reporter published : 12:01 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 25 january 2013 modern militaries have all manner of weapons at their disposal from nuclear submarines to heat - seeking missiles			0
but 400 years ago technology was rather more limited and armies had to make the very best of their resources - in whatever shape or form they may take			1
one such quest to steal a march on the enemy led to the publication of a whacky manuscript from 16th century @entity18 which even considered using cats and birds to bomb opposing forces			0
animal arsenal : this drawing from a 16th century @entity18 weapons manuscript shows how cats and birds were considered as possible delivery systems for bombs in warfare called @entity30 , which translates from old @entity18 as @entity32 , the 235 - page treatise from 1584 contains a drawing of a feline and his feathered friend with ' rocket packs ' strapped to backs as they ran and fly past a castle			1
it 's not clear whether they were actually used , but animals have for centuries been deployed in warfare , often to deliver messages or for transportation , but sometimes as weapons			1
at the beginning of the @entity49 , which ruled @entity50 between 960 and 1279 , monkeys were thought to have been employed in a battle between rebels of the @entity54 province and the @entity55			0
they were clothed with straw , dipped in oil and set alight before being set loose into the enemy 's camp			0
crazy contraptions : this sketch , from the 1584 treatise , shows exploding bombs hovering over a cauldron explosive document : the dossier is entitled @entity30 , which translates from old @entity18 as @entity32 in the 16th century , a @entity18 artillery officer once presented a plan to use cats to spread poisonous gas among enemy soldiers , although it was never enacted			1
and much like miners used canaries to warn of gas leaks , the @entity77 employed around 500,000 felines to warn of lethal fumes during @entity80			0
in the @entity83 , the @entity82 military experimented with bat bombs , which consisted of a casing that contained a @entity86 attached with a timed explosive			2
the idea was for the casings to be dropped from an aircraft and release the bats which would then roost in eaves and attics before the timers went off			0
not human resources : animals have for centuries been used in warfare , often to deliver messages or for transportation , but also sometimes as weapons a man ( left ) loads a far more conventional weapon on the battlefield , a cannon , while the bombs dreamt up came in all shapes and sizes ( right ) several tests were carried out , but the plan was scrapped in 1944 when fleet admiral @entity110 realised it would not be combat - ready until mid- 1945			1
by that time , around $ 2million had been spent on the project			0
more recently , donkeys have been used by insurgents to detonate explosives in @entity116 and @entity117			2
but the use of animals was never really that widespread if for no other reason than nature 's notorious unpredictability , which is never a reassuring quality where explosives are involved			1
bizarre : it is anyone 's guess what this weapon is supposed to be trying to steal a march on the enemy : the university summarises the dossier as a ' treatise on munitions and explosive devices , with many illustrations of the various devices and their uses ' other sketches in @entity139 , which has been released in digital form by the @entity141 , include barrel bombs , hand grenades , anti-personnel ground spikes and @entity146 - style fireworks			1
the university said the manuscript contains 34 colour illustrations , two of which are pasted in , possibly cut from another document			2
it summarises the dossier as a ' treatise on munitions and explosive devices , with many illustrations of the various devices and their uses			2
' what some of them are is anyone 's guess .			0
