by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:21 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 18:33 est , 15 june 2013 unhappy : @entity2 with the bike at the centre of the @entity6 affair a diplomatic protection officer and a middle - aged woman were arrested yesterday over the alleged ‘ @entity6 ’ plot to discredit former @entity10 minister @entity2			1
in all , six people – four police and two others – have been detained by @entity15 detectives investigating claims that a conspiracy cost the former chief whip his job			2
mr @entity2 was forced to resign after allegations he was aggressive towards officers and called them ‘ plebs ’ when they would not let him take his bicycle through the main @entity25 gate in september			1
but a @entity27 investigation cast doubt on the police account			1
among other things it revealed that @entity33 footage disproved the claim that a large group of tourists were outside the gate during the row			0
@entity38 said the 48 - year - old policeman arrested yesterday is being questioned on suspicion of misconduct in public office			1
the woman , aged 49 , is suspected of assisting an offender			1
both were held following ‘ fresh information ’ given to @entity15 officers on june 4			0
@entity47 mp , a friend of mr @entity2 , wrote to the @entity48 on that day highlighting evidence which ‘ strongly reinforces the case that a conspiracy took place ’			1
in his letter to the @entity48 , mr @entity47 referred to documents lodged by @entity56 newspaper in defence of a libel action taken against them by mr @entity2			1
in them , the paper refers to a call it received the morning after the incident from an anonymous woman who described herself as a tourist			0
she was said to have overheard @entity2 saying to police officers : ‘ you ’re f * * * * * * morons – you think you run the country , well you do n’t			1
’ but mr @entity47 pointed out to the @entity48 that video evidence showed ‘ there were no civilian witnesses in earshot of any exchange ’			0
he added : ‘ the only possible explanation therefore is that this bogus witness was yet another police officer masquerading as a civilian , or a civilian put up to it by one of the police officers who was aware of the original incident			1
’ last night mr @entity47 said : ‘ all i was doing was what you would expect any decent policeman to do			0
looking at the facts with a cool forensic eye			0
’ the arrested policeman had previously been issued with a regulation 15 notice , served following an alleged breach of professional standards			0
he has been on restricted duties but will now be suspended			0
mischief : @entity96 mp suggested mischievously that broadcaster @entity27 should be put in charge of the investigation in a further development , @entity100 has learned that detectives have followed the advice of another @entity10 minister and turned to @entity27 for help			1
last week @entity96 mp stood up in the @entity106 and suggested mischievously that the broadcaster should be put in charge of the investigation			0
he said : ‘ the @entity27 dispatches programme took 10 days to establish that the video record was completely at odds with the police account of events			1
‘ since the police have interviewed 800 officers , spent £ 144,000 and taken eight months apparently to go nowhere , might it be an idea to invite @entity27 ’s dispatches to be put in charge of the investigation , as it appears more effective and would certainly be more independent ? ’ two days after mr @entity96 ’s comments detective superintendent @entity119 wrote to @entity27 ’s political editor @entity120 requesting emails and communications with @entity123 , 52 , the officer @entity27 first contacted six months ago			1
mr @entity123 , from @entity124 , @entity125 , was arrested in january on suspicion of misconduct in public office			0
revealed : dispatches and @entity128 revealed @entity33 footage contradicted claims that onlookers had been shocked by the incident as it showed just one , uninterested , man walking past under investigation : the @entity33 footage showed an exchange that raised questions about the description in police logs leaked to the media the letter said the @entity144 had sent a report to the @entity146 but wished to identify all lines of enquiry			2
it also asked for communications with any of @entity123 ’s associates			0
@entity27 is understood to be considering how to respond			2
the events date from september 19 , 2012 , when police on duty in @entity25 refused to open the gate for @entity2 to leave by bike			1
according to a police log leaked to the media later , mr @entity2 is said to have told the police to ‘ learn your f * * * * * * place ’ ; that they did n’t ‘ run this f * * * * * * government ’ , and that they were ‘ f * * * * * * plebs ’			1
but in december dispatches and @entity128 revealed @entity33 footage that contradicted the account in the leaked logs			0
reports said the log mentioned eyewitnesses who were ‘ visibly shocked ’			0
but the footage shows just one man wandering past , who did n’t appear to show particular interest in the incident			0
the @entity167 programme also revealed an email was sent from a man in @entity124 to his mp @entity180 – who coincidentally was and still is deputy chief whip – with an account very similar to the police log published in the media			2
denial : while mr @entity2 apologised for using profanity , he has always denied calling the officers ' plebs ' and ' morons ' , or telling them to ' know their place ' friends of mr @entity2 said last night that @entity38 had many questions to answer about the case			2
‘ if it has taken eight months to turn to such an obvious line of inquiry it must be clear to everyone that the @entity144 is dragging its heels , ’ said one			0
while mr @entity2 apologised for using profanity , he has always denied calling the officers ‘ plebs ’ and ‘ morons ’ , or telling them to ‘ know their place ’			2
@entity15 was launched in december to investigate whether there was a conspiracy to frame mr @entity2			2
sir @entity208 , the @entity209 , originally stood by his officers , saying they had ‘ accurately reported what happened ’			0
but he was later forced to promise that he would preside over a ‘ ruthless search for the truth ’ about the ‘ @entity6 ’ confrontation that led to mr @entity2 ’s resignation .			1
