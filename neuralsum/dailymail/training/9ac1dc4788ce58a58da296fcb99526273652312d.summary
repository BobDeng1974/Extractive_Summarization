world map showing where radio waves conquered still hangs defiantly in @entity4 's office by @entity5 published : 12:25 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 16:05 est , 18 july 2012 visitors arriving in @entity8 ’s county town are met with the proud sign ‘ welcome to @entity10 , the birthplace of radio ’			1
it was there , exactly 100 years ago , that @entity4 opened the first ever wireless factory , from which he broadcast to the whole world			1
but rather than being a source of pride for the residents of @entity10 - recently upgraded to city status - the building from which the first airwaves sprung has instead become an embarrassment			1
the premises now lie in tatters - a pigeon - infested , crumbling graveyard of memories			0
the @entity4 factory in @entity10 , @entity8 , the first place to ever broadcast radio 100 years ago , now lies in tatters there is still no decision on which developer will take a £ 14m gamble on the site after its previous owners , @entity37 , collapsed at the start of the recession @entity4 , the inventor of radio , is seen here at @entity41 , @entity42 's , @entity43 in 1901 after the first transatlantic wireless transmission had been received @entity4 's office in the @entity10 factory is empty and gloomy , thanks to the bedraggled brown drape hanging in the window - but a world map showing where his radio waves conquered still hangs defiantly above a grimy mantelpiece			1

but a world map showing where his radio waves conquered still hangs defiantly above a grimy mantelpiece			1
earlier this month , 60 environment , architecture , arts and community representatives from the @entity61 toured the historic listed building in new street in the hope of finding a way to salvage its past glory			1
@entity4 's invention had helped save the lives of more than 700 people on board the @entity72 , which sank in april 1912 , and orders for maritime wireless equipment were piling up			1
in the wake of the disaster , 200 ambassadors and delegates travelled to @entity10 to praise the pioneer for his vision at the @entity81 , and the town 's burgeoning future was set			1
@entity85 @entity84 , who came from @entity86 to work at new street from 1964 to 1991 , was on the tour			0
broken pipework and bare walls litter the now derelict 1912 building ; right , @entity4 at his desk in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 in 1934 the factory has been empty since 2008 , when one of the successors of the former @entity98 moved to @entity99 ( above in 1955 ) , leaving the building at the mercy of the elements the state of the factory is a far cry from the grand opening in june 1912 , when hundreds of world ambassadors and delegates attended the @entity109 after the titanic disaster ' all the @entity112 and mobile phones , televisions and computers we have were down to @entity4 , who chose @entity10 as the place to pass his gift to the world , ' he said			1
' that building has to be saved			2
i used to work in there days on end			0
a place like that becomes part of you			0
' it is one of the most important places in the modern world , but its present state is a disgrace			2
' @entity4 needed premises for his new company - somewhere a relatively short distance from @entity94 and easily accessible by rail			1
@entity10 proved to be the perfect location			1
the first offices he established in @entity141 in 1898 were soon deemed unsuitable for the growing enterprise			0
by 1912 , the first purpose - built radio factory - the @entity144 at @entity145 - ultimately became the company headquarters			2
there is still no decision on which developer will take a £ 14million gamble on the site after its previous owners , @entity37 , collapsed at the start of the recession , leaving the property in the hands of the administrators @entity158			0
the @entity160 group hope the land could become new homes , businesses , art spaces and workshops , either newly - built or in the existing art deco buildings @entity4 and his wife ( centre and left ) outside the ' @entity169 ' in the rooms of the famous scientists at the @entity172 in 1933 the factory has been empty since 2008 , when one of the successors of the former @entity98 moved to nearby @entity99 , leaving the 1912 building at the mercy of the elements			1
the @entity10 team , linked to the @entity180 , was allowed into the crumbling premises on saturday to explore ideas for its future , in the hope of inspiring a new owner with its own vision			1
@entity4 was born in @entity187 , @entity188 , on april 25 , 1874			1
as a child , he showed a keen interest in science - and , in his early twenties , began experimenting at his father 's country estate at @entity195 where he managed to send wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles			2
a year later , @entity4 moved to @entity198 where he was introduced to @entity199 , the @entity200 's engineer - in - chief			1
shortly afterwards , he was granted the world 's first patent for a system of wireless telegraphy			1
in 1897 , he set up @entity206 , which was renamed @entity207 in 1900			0
he then performed a demonstration to the @entity209 ( where wireless signals were sent over 12 miles ) - and also established wireless communication between @entity212 and @entity198 across the @entity213			0
@entity4 created permanent wireless stations at @entity215 , @entity216 , at @entity217 and later at the @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220			1
in 1900 , he took out his famous patent no. 7777 for ' tuned or syntonic telegraphy '			0
and to prove that wireless waves were not affected by the curvature of the @entity225 , he used his system for transmitting the first wireless signals across the @entity228 between @entity229 , @entity230 , and @entity42 's , @entity43 , a distance of 2,100 miles in december that same year			1
in 1905 , he married the @entity232 , daughter of the 14th @entity233 - but the marriage was annulled in 1927			0
that year , he married the @entity235 of @entity236			0
various other patents followed before he joined the @entity238 in 1914 where he was to reach the rank of navy commander			0
in 1923 , he revisited his studies of short waves , conducting tests between installations at the @entity246 and in his yacht @entity248			2
these experiments would give rise to the beam system for long distance communication - used three years later by the @entity253 to link @entity198 and @entity254			0
in 1932 , he set up the world 's first microwave radiotelephone link between the @entity257 and the @entity258 's summer residence			1
and in @entity188 in 1935 , he demonstrated the principles of radar			0
@entity4 received many honours during his lifetime , including the @entity264 in 1909 , which he shared with professor @entity265 - and was awarded the hereditary title of @entity267 in 1929			1
he died in @entity236 on july 20 , 1937			0
source : @entity269 the group met at @entity272 's @entity271 down the road , before heading for the damp and disused complex			2
it was a far cry from the grand opening in june 1912 , when hundreds of world ambassadors and delegates attended the @entity109 after the titanic disaster			2
@entity4 was the star in a posse of dignitaries from @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , and even warring @entity286 and @entity188 , who had travelled to @entity10 to congratulate him on building the world 's new home of radio in less than two months			1
later that day , @entity4 even hosted a lavish @entity292 dinner for delegates , including press magnate @entity294			1
but there are signs of a fight - back			0
yesterday , the windows of the listed building were set to be plastered with giant posters made by a local printing firm , depicting @entity4			1
the group 's members came up with a range of ideas for phased development of the site			2
they hope the land could become new homes , businesses , art spaces and workshops , either newly - built or in the existing art deco buildings			0
professor @entity315 , of the @entity316 , which financed the day , saw big possibilities for a gallery or theatre in the old @entity321 power plant			0
' it 's a marvellous , airy , vibrant space , ' he said			2
another suggestion was a restaurant for diners to muse over the city landscape in a new tower block overlooking the @entity329 rail embankment			0
@entity330 , a @entity331 architect , who attended in his private capacity as a member of the action group , said : ' we have a completely new opportunity with an open canvas			0
' but he warned the audience : ' we are currently dealing with clients who have no feeling for the place ; all they want is their money back			0
' he added : ' it is true that a previous planning permission allowed for demolition of the building with the wavy roof and the one that looked like an old art deco cinema , and we could not prevent a new developer doing that if he insisted			2
' but we hope we can negotiate to get a gradual development that is meaningful to the community , with intelligent re-use of the existing buildings			0
' we start next week with the message sent by the posters that the 1912 building is of world importance			1
' changing @entity10 will meet again to thrash out a policy document to encourage community - minded development of the land			2
@entity365 's @entity364 said : ' i have a hard - nosed view about this now after so many disappointments			2
' the answer is to demolish everything apart from the 1912 building and turn it into housing , like high rise flats and houses that people need and will give the developer return on his investment			0
' no developer is going to have money to spare for saving buildings with concrete cancer , but they could rebuild in a style hinting at what was there before			0
' even the 1912 building is compartmentalised so would be costly to open up , and the main walls are single skin , making it a cold winter prospect and costly to heat			0
' it may be possible to get a developer to invest in the 1912 building , but not much more			0
' @entity4 on board his yacht @entity248 , where he often conducted experiments , in 1934			2

historic building in @entity10 , @entity8 , has been empty since 2008
