@entity0 is adamant his situation and mindset have not changed now he is again leading the @entity3			1
so long the hunter over the course of the current campaign , @entity0 is back in front for only the second time this season in the wake of the events in sunday 's @entity12			1
after bitter rival and @entity15 team - mate @entity13 retired after 14 laps following a wiring loom failure in the steering column of his car , @entity0 went on to take the chequered flag			1
@entity0 dominated in @entity21 to take a lead in the championship over teammate @entity13 the 29 - year - old now has a three - point lead going into the final five races of the season , starting with next weekend 's race in @entity29 , and followed swiftly a week later by the inaugural @entity30 @entity12			1
but despite the man now being hunted , @entity0 said : ' nothing changes			1
' i have believed , since the time i started training for this season , that i can win the world championship this year			2
' and with a great car like this , even with some of the difficulties i 've had , you know you are still within shooting range			0
' you have to keep that positivity , belief and hope - hope is one of the most powerful things in the world - and i carry that with me each weekend			0
the @entity50 says he was always positive and wo n't change his mindset now he leads the way ' i have n't lost that vision or that dream , that 's still there , and i did n't leave @entity21 thinking the title is more of a possibility			1
' in my mind i 'm still hunting for it and i 've got to go just as hard , if not harder , over these final races			2
i 've just got to keep going			0
' after winning the last two races from pole position , @entity0 would appear to have momentum on his side			1
but given @entity15 ' unreliability of late , he is also aware of how quickly a situation can turn			2
' @entity67 is not something i generally talk about because it can be snatched away , ' added @entity0			2
@entity0 may have the momentum but @entity13 has shown how quickly it can all change over a season ' look at @entity13			1
he had momentum from good results , and then one @entity74 ( did not finish ) and it was snatched away			0
' i 've also had that , so you just have to take it one race at a time			0
' but i 'm happy i 've been at my best , getting the ( recent ) pole positions , maximising all the races			0
' i now want to make sure these last five races - if i never do any more races in my life - are as good			0
they have to be the ones			0

@entity0 won in @entity21 to move top of championship *standings*
@entity92 *driver* ' still hunting ' despite being out in front
@entity0 says momentum can change very quickly but he will be positive
