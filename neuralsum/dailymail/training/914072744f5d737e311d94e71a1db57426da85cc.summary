pigs which are shot at and blown up for training into battlefield injuries are treated ‘ humanely ’ , a defence minister has claimed			1
@entity3 refused to ban the tests which have seen scores of animals blown up in the last three three years			1
animal rights groups have condemned the exercises and insisted modern alternatives could be found , but mr @entity3 insisted nothing was as realistic as using the ‘ live pig models ’			1
in one test a group of farm animals were put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in @entity31 , @entity32			1
green mp @entity33 called on the @entity13 to ‘ abandon the use of live pigs in military battlefield exercises ’			1
she urged the government to hold talks with @entity39 , @entity40 , the @entity41 and @entity42 ‘ to learn from their use of mannequins as a replacement ’			0
defence minister @entity3 said there was no alternative to the experience surgeons get from treating live pigs but ministers insist the exercise are the only way to replicate the injuries soldiers sustain on the frontline , in order to give military medics training in how to treat horrific wounds			1
responding to a parliamentary question , mr @entity3 said : ‘ as a key element in their training for operational deployment , members of the @entity19 @entity61 attend military exercise surgical training courses in @entity66			2
‘ these exercises are essential to ensure our medical personnel are capable of carrying out potentially life - saving surgery on casualties with serious bullet and blast wounds			0
‘ injuries of such severity are not routinely encountered during their clinical practice in @entity78 hospitals , but they are regularly required to treat them when on operational deployment			0
participating in @entity66 training minimises the number of animals involved			0
‘ the pigs are treated humanely with full use of anaesthetics			2
there are a number of sophisticated simulation models on the market that provide effective training in certain surgical techniques , and the @entity13 already uses these where clinically appropriate			0
‘ however , none of those currently available provide a viable alternative to the serious bullet and blast wound training that our surgeons receive from live pig models			1
’ according to latest figures , some 21 pigs were blown up in 2010 , 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012			1

row : @entity105 said that more than 80 per cent of @entity19 's allies in the @entity110 - including 20 @entity112 member states - no longer train military medical personnel using animals a spokesman said : ‘ to shoot , stab or blow up live pigs in order to train our military medics makes as much sense as conducting modern warfare with muskets			2
‘ vastly superior non-animal trauma training methods , including life - like human - patient simulators , are available and used by the militaries of 23 of the @entity19 's 27 @entity110 allies			0
‘ it 's time for the military to end its participation in these inhumane and ill - conceived exercises for the sake of both our fighting forces and animals			0
