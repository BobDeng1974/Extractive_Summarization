@entity0 has been cleared of breaching broadcasting rules despite sparking more than 900 complaints			1
the controversial @entity4 show prompted a furore in january from viewers who claimed it was ' poverty porn ' which misrepresented benefit claimants across @entity9			2
but broadcasting watchdog @entity10 ruled the show about @entity0 , @entity12 , was clearly a portrayal of one street and not wider society			1
" ' the aim of the series was therefore presented as being a record of the daily lives of some of the residents of this particular road to inform viewers about their lives and their community			0
' @entity10 â€™s view was that it would have been clear to viewers , over the course of the series , that this was an observational documentary about the experiences of one community			1
' therefore , after careful consideration , we concluded that overall @entity4 ensured there was sufficient context over the course of the series to justify the offence and that it applied generally accepted standards			0
' the series was a ratings hit for @entity4 but drew criticism for allegedly demonising those living on the breadline			0
it caused a stir when it was screened and prompted discussion in @entity67 as well as public meetings in the area where some of those featured claimed they were misrepresented			0
ruling : @entity10 said the portrayal of @entity0 ( pictured ) was not meant to reflect all of @entity9 the vast majority of complaints - 887 - were about the way those on benefits were portrayed			1
some 23 viewers also raised fears about children and young people featured in the show and the care which was given by programme makers for their welfare and dignity			2
@entity10 also ruled in @entity4 's favour on these complaints , none of which were from those featured in the show , saying : ' after a thorough assessment of the evidence , @entity10 found sufficient steps were taken before , during and after production to protect the welfare of the children that appeared in the programme and that any potentially offensive material was justified by the context in which it was presented			1
' @entity10 has therefore concluded that the series did not breach its rules			2
' there were also 40 complaints about the programmes demonstrating criminal techniques , including shoplifting			0
but @entity10 said it was satisfied that there was an editorial justification for their inclusion and there were not enough details for people to copy the techniques			2
controversy : @entity0 in @entity12 became the subject of a national debate in january a @entity4 spokesman said : ' we welcome @entity10 's finding that @entity0 did not breach the code in any respect			1
' we are proud that our robust duty of care protocols for the child contributors have been praised for " demonstrating best practice " , and for the recognition that we ' ensured the interests of the under - 18s who featured in @entity0 were protected and that due care was applied before , during and after production			0
' @entity10 noted that the series " illustrated important issues facing some children living in contemporary @entity9 " and that " the children 's welfare was at the heart of the production "			0

@entity146 show sparked complaints over ' *skewed* ' portrayal of people on benefits
