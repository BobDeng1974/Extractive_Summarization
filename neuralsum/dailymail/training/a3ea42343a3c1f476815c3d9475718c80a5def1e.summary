by @entity0 @entity2 legend @entity1 has tweeted his joy after the team announced head coach @entity5 is resigning @entity2 legend @entity1 said he ' could n't be happier ' after the team announced head coach @entity5 would be resigning earlier today			1
the former player and current @entity8 pundit , who has been a vocal critic of @entity5 , tweeted : ' happy days are here again ! @entity5 resigns as the @entity2 coach			1
i could n't be happier ! ' the injury - plagued @entity2 were 27 - 55 this season , their worst campaign in more than 50 years and the second - worst winning percentage in franchise history			1
the drop in form represents a harsh fall - from - grace for one of the @entity22 's proudest and most successful franchises			0
as of summer 2012 , shortly before @entity5 joined , the team held the @entity22 record for most wins , highest winning percentage , and greatest number of @entity22 finals appearances			2
@entity30 spokesman @entity29 confirmed @entity5 's resignation , ending the brief tenure of the @entity2 ' fourth head coach in less than three years			1
@entity5 went 67 - 87 after taking over the @entity2 early in the 2012 - 13 season			1
he replaced the fired @entity35 , who lasted just 71 games after replacing 11 - time @entity22 champion coach @entity37 in 2011			2
since the start of @entity5 's tenure at the head of the @entity2 , @entity1 has been an outspoken critic			1
when his appointment was announced @entity1 used twitter to say he was in ' mourning ' that the @entity2 had not decided to re-hire @entity37 , who won five championships during his 11 - year career at the head of the team			2
@entity1 regularly used his role as an @entity8 analyst to criticise everything from @entity5 's strategy , defensive tactics and offensive pick - and - roll style			1
as recently as january this year , @entity1 used an appearance on tonight with @entity54 to take a swipe at @entity5 , but shortly afterwards said he was going to stop complaining about the team , as it was n't doing ' the players , coaches or ownership ' any good			2
with @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 sitting out large chunks of the season while the @entity2 lost an @entity22 - worst 319 man - games to injuries , the 16 - time @entity22 champion franchise missed the playoffs for the first time in nine seasons and only the third time in 38 years			1
they were 27 - 55 this season , their worst campaign for more than 50 years happy days : @entity1 , former @entity2 player and @entity8 analyst , has been critical of @entity5 's coaching style ' given the circumstances , i do n't know that anybody could have done a better job than @entity5 did the past two seasons , ' @entity2 general manager @entity80 said			1
' on behalf of the @entity2 , we thank @entity5 for the work ethic , professionalism and positive attitude that he brought to the team every day			2
we wish him the best of luck			0
' the 62 - year - old @entity5 had one year left on his contract , but wanted the @entity2 to pick up his option year for 2015 - 16 to have any chance of success			2
the @entity2 apparently refused , leading to @entity5 's resignation			1
@entity5 walked away from a $ 4 million payday for next season , although he may receive a portion of that money as severance			2
a phone message left for @entity5 was n't immediately returned			0
despite the @entity2 ' injuries on a roster consisting mostly of players on one - year contracts , @entity109 fans largely directed their anger during a rare down season toward @entity5			1
@entity5 also has coached the @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
he reached two @entity116 finals with @entity62 in @entity113 before having much less success in @entity118			0
' whenever a coach is n't there anymore , for whatever reason , all of us in the fraternity feel badly , ' @entity120 coach @entity119 said after the @entity120 ' playoff victory over @entity128			0
' he is a heck of a coach and heck of a guy			0
you always feel badly when something like that happens			0
i just hope that what he wants is going to be what happens for him			0
he is a special guy			0
' @entity5 's signature up - tempo style of play seemed an odd match from the start with the aging , ball - dominating @entity61 and the @entity2 , who ran @entity37 's deliberate triangle offense to perfection			1
@entity2 owners @entity148 and @entity150 curiously chose @entity5 to replace @entity35 over @entity37 , who strongly contemplated a return for a third stint on the @entity109 bench			2
@entity37 became the president of the @entity114 in march			0
the @entity2 have been plagued by injuries this season , with ( from left to right ) @entity61 , @entity63 and @entity62 all consigned to the bench for large chunks of the campaign @entity80 said he will begin the search immediately for the @entity2 ' fifth head coach since 2011 - including @entity37 , who walked away from the team after falling short of a third consecutive championship			1
@entity5 's departure will allow the @entity2 ' franchise overhaul to begin in earnest after their worst season since 1957 - 58 back in @entity167			1
@entity109 missed the postseason for just the second time in the 17 - season career of @entity61 , who occasionally clashed with @entity5			1
the @entity2 have a top - 10 pick in a strong draft and just three players under contract for next season , including @entity62 and @entity61			1
the fourth - leading scorer in @entity22 history will make more than $ 48 million over the next two years			0
a coaching change also might make the @entity2 more attractive to @entity63 , an unrestricted free agent who intimated he would n't consider returning if @entity5 still coached the team			1
@entity80 has said the @entity2 are very interested in re-signing the 7 - foot @entity179 , one of the top available free agents			2
' there would have to be significant changes , ' @entity63 wrote in @entity183 on his personal blog recently			0
' i 've never concealed the fact that @entity5 's style does n't suit my game			1
' i do n't know if my decision will be swayed by whether @entity5 stays or leaves			0
obviously , the coach is a very important factor for any team			0
' after joining the @entity2 on short notice last season , @entity5 was unable to assemble a contending team immediately around @entity61 and @entity198 , who struggled to embrace the pick - and - roll game so important to @entity5 's offense			1
@entity1 has criticised @entity202 's pick - and - roll style offence , as have several team members , including @entity63 @entity5 had a three year contract , but had been asking the @entity2 to pick his option year for 2015 - 16 , which they apparently refused , leading to his resignation @entity109 won 45 games last season despite its awful start under @entity35			1
but the @entity2 lost @entity61 to a torn achilles tendon late in the regular season before getting swept out of the first round by @entity120			2
@entity198 left the @entity2 as a free agent last summer , fleeing to @entity214 for less money to escape the @entity2 ' drama and high expectations			0
@entity61 played in just six games this season after breaking a bone near his knee in december , and @entity109 never had a consistently competitive team in his absence			2
@entity62 also missed most of the season with various injuries , but the 40 - year - old point guard hopes to play again next season			1
@entity5 realized he would take the blame for the @entity2 ' woes this season , and the veteran coach seemed comfortable with the prospect when the team packed up for the summer			1
' every coach should be under scrutiny , ' @entity5 said two weeks ago			0
' some coaches get fired even after the best years they 've ever had			0
... there 's always things we could have done better , and it 's easier with hindsight			0
' things do n't always go smoothly			0
for the most part , our guys were very competitive			0
for us , there are some silver linings in there , but in hindsight , it 's disappointing for everybody			0
