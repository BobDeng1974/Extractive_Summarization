they are words which will strike fear into every addict - we 're running out of chocolate			0
that 's according to the world 's largest confectionary producer , which has joined @entity8 in warning of a massive shortfall which could reach a million tonnes a year by 2020			1
@entity12 's @entity11 said soaring demand have helped chocolate prices hit more than double what they were just eight years ago			1
but there are limited quantities of the fragile crop - which means as production rises , so does the price			0
that leaves manufacturers with little choice but to raise prices on the shelves , make bars smaller or pack them with fruit , nuts and wafers			0
industry experts say the world is in its longest production shortfall for five decades			0
@entity47 prices rose by a quarter in a year to a peak in august of £ 2,000 a tonne , nearing a february 2011 peak , @entity11 said			1
dream job ? a quality control technician tests a sample from a giant vat of chocolate in a factory ( file photo ) rising prices : how cocoa costs are approaching their 2011 peak again in dollars ( red line ) and @entity62 ( blue line ) , a combination of four major currencies - the @entity67 dollar , @entity69 pound , @entity70 and the @entity71 before the end of 2007 they had barely risen above £ 1,300			2
in 2005 they hovered around just £ 1,000 , according to figures from the @entity77 - based @entity76 ( @entity76 )			1
@entity11 chief executive @entity22 said the hike was fuelled partly by a ' potential cocoa shortage ' by 2020 - echoing previous warnings by @entity82			1
the @entity69 - founded sweet treats giant has repeatedly claimed demand will outstrip supply by a million tonnes a year by 2020			0
' the global cocoa sector may suffer a 1million metric ton shortfall by 2020 because of increasing economic and environmental pressures on cocoa farms around the world , ' the firm said			2
' our long - term business depends on a sustainable supply of high quality cocoa , and we believe that securing cocoa ’s future begins with increasing yield for the smallholder farmers			0
' butterfly effect : the chaos caused by the @entity103 outbreak ( pictured ) has affected @entity105 cocoa exports partly to blame are disease and drought , according to @entity109 - which could be beaten by resilient new breeds of cocoa beans			1
but we are also getting hungrier for sweet treats - especially in developing nations like @entity115			0
@entity11 's sales grew by 9.3 per cent in @entity117 last year - compared to 5.4 per cent in the @entity118 and just 0.1 per cent in western @entity119			2
@entity8 opened a £ 170million new plant in @entity121 earlier this year to meet rising demand , and last month @entity11 announced it would pour £ 7.3million into its factory in @entity124 , @entity125			1
but some surprising news events have a hand in the price , including the @entity103 outbreak			0
because 70 per cent of the world 's cocoa comes from @entity105 , chaos and quarantine restrictions mean global production has dipped by 0.7 per cent , the @entity76 said			1
and pledges to beat @entity135 poverty could also have an impact - as many @entity105 cocoa farmers live on less than £ 1 a day .			2

@entity12 - based @entity11 warns of global deficit by 2020
it comes after @entity8 said there could be a million - tonne production gap
@entity47 prices hit £ 2,000 a tonne , double what they were eight years ago
trade hit by @entity103 in @entity105 - which supplies 70 *%* of world 's cocoa
