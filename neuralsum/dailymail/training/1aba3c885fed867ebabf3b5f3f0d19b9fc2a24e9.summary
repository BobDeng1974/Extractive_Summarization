i thought it was disgusting what he had been doing			0
he was coming towards me with his arms waving			1
i thought he was going to take a swing for me so i just punched him			0

i grabbed the back of his hands and grabbed hold of his belt which snapped and it cut all my hand			1
i knew i had to get him			0
' then i got his arm and put it up his back so he could n’t move and held on to him			0
there was a lot of commotion and a bit of a scuffle but nothing serious			1
i did what i had to do to restrain him			0
' i go to the gym so i ’m quite strong and i knew i was stronger than him			0
he was saying ‘ can we just talk ’ but i thought ‘ no what you are doing is wrong ’			0
it ’s the lowest of the low stealing from a church and he is scum			0

i shouted for them to call the police			0
' i had his arm up behind his back and i walked him over to where they were stood			0
he kept pleading with me to ask if we could talk but i was n’t having any of it			0
' unbeknown to me , my phone was in my pocket and had called my dad			2
he had picked it up and he ’d heard the commotion and started to panic			1
he thought i was in trouble at first			0
shortly afterwards he suffered a heart attack and had to hospital			1
' when the police arrived they knew who he was instantly and addressed him using first name terms			0
' my phone started ringing and it was my mum telling me how proud she was because they ’d heard everything on the phone			1
' she kept saying , ‘ i ’m so proud of you ’ , but then she said my dad was having a funny turn and then my sister called to say he ’d been taken to hospital in an ambulance			0
' @entity58 : @entity21 has a close connection to the church and was pictured at a christening service ( at the back in a light grey suit and black shirt ) just three weeks ago in court mrs @entity210 prosecuting said : ' the church warden says that lead was missing and other pieces of lead were loose			1
it will cost a substantial amount of money to fix			0
