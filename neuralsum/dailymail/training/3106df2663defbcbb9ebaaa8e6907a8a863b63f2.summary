but that was not going to stand in the way of a ' joke ' student union candidate who has won a landslide victory at one of the world 's oldest universities			1
@entity14 , a geography student at @entity15 , won despite his pledges including ' double beds for all ' and world peace			1
he won 1,685 votes - 710 more than his nearest rival , who was from the @entity28 club politics : @entity14 , pictured djing in tie - dye and @entity4 boxer shorts			1

the @entity42 student listed the reasons to vote for him as ' i do geography ' , ' i often wear flip flops ' and being named one of @entity15 's ' top clubbers '			2
he beat his rivals at an official hustings by performing a spoof country - and - @entity53 song instead of speaking about his policies			0
at one point he is thought to have emulated the 1995 film braveheart by giving a rabble - rousing speech backed by a kilt - wearing bagpipe player			1
instead of writing a manifesto , he wrote a ' personifesto ' in an apparent attempt to combat sexism			1
jokers : the student uploaded a misspelt @entity66 - style photo ... which was then doctored further @entity14 , left , wore devil horns at a student hustings where he played a country and @entity53 style song			1

and his promise of a monorail to colleges on the edge of the city was an apparent tribute to the long - running tv series @entity88 , in which a conman swindles @entity90 by promising a glittering new transport system			0
his reputation turned around after he wrote a serious piece for the newspaper @entity94 outlining a deeper vision			2
true statesman : @entity14 surprised everyone by winning the race at @entity15 he said : ' i still ca n’t believe people call me the " joke candidate " ' , adding : ' i am clearly not a careerist – a quick @entity104 search of my name will show how unlikely i am to ever get a job anywhere where there is widely available internet access			2

news editor of @entity151 said : ' @entity14 made a refreshing change from the identi - kit lefty non-candidates who keep getting elected , and to be honest , @entity111 was long overdue for a wake - up call to make it realise that it needs to be relevant to students again			0
' also , @entity157 's college is really really far away , and @entity14 's monorail was the only policy offering a real solution			2
' but others did not see the funny side			0
