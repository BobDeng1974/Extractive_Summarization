by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 have signed a joint declaration that promises more financial powers for @entity7 if it rejects independence			1
the move by the leaders of the three main parties is an attempt to rubbish claims by @entity14 that @entity15 will not deliver more devolution if @entity7 vote ‘ no ’			1
it comes ahead of tonight 's tv debate between @entity7 first minister mr @entity14 and @entity19 , the former @entity21 chancellor who fronts the pro-union @entity23 campaign			1
the three leaders of the main parties - @entity2 , @entity4 and @entity3 - pictured yesterday at a service to commemorate 100 years since the outbreak of @entity29 , have signed a joint declaration of more financial powers for @entity7 if they reject independence there are just over six weeks to go until voters in @entity7 decide whether to remain in the @entity35 or become an independent nation in the september 18 referendum			1
polls have so far failed to show a majority in favour of independence , but both campaigns are hoping to receive a boost as a result of tonight ’s tv debate			1
the six leaders ’ declaration states : ‘ we support a strong @entity48 in a strong @entity35			0
‘ we now pledge to strengthen further the powers of the @entity48 , in particular in the areas of fiscal responsibility and social security			0
’ currently , control over council tax and business rates means the @entity56 raises about 15 per cent of its £ 30billion budget , with the majority of public spending funded by a block grant from the @entity61			1
the @entity62 have the most radical vision for further devolution , proposing to hand over full control of inheritance tax , capital gains tax , income tax and a good share of corporation tax			0
@entity48 , the @entity48 , would then control 60 per cent of its revenue			0
the declaration came as @entity7 first minister @entity14 , left , prepared for a tv debate with @entity19 , right , who fronts the pro-union better together campaign @entity21 has proposed increasing the figure to 40 per cent , although experts dispute their calculations			1
they want members of the @entity48 to have control of a 15p share of the basic 20p rate of income tax , and be able to increase higher bands – but not lower them unless all levels are reduced			0
@entity88 proposals would allow full control over all rates of income tax , with the block grant from @entity15 reduced accordingly			0
vat levels must remain the same under @entity95 rules , but a share of the revenue from @entity7 would be controlled by @entity48			2
@entity7 mps would also be allowed to ‘ supplement ’ welfare benefits , while housing benefit could be devolved			2
if around half of the @entity105 revenue from @entity7 was allocated to @entity48 , the parliament would be responsible for more than 50 per cent of its budget			1
@entity107 , campaign director for the @entity23 campaign , said : ‘ voters in @entity7 have been listening to the independence debate for over two years now			2
currently , control over council tax and business rates means the @entity56 raises about 15 per cent of its £ 30billion budget ‘ surely if @entity14 had convincing answers on the details of separation , we would have heard them by now			1
’ he added : ‘ the referendum debate is n’t confined to tv studios			2
it is taking place in conversations between friends and family across @entity7			0
‘ the biggest debate is taking place on the doorsteps , around kitchen tables and in workplaces across the country			0
‘ and the more people talk about what leaving the @entity35 would mean for our schools and hospitals , the more they are saying no thanks to separation			0
’ yes @entity7 chief executive @entity140 said : ‘ @entity141 is the opportunity of a lifetime for the people of @entity7			0
' we know @entity7 is one of the richest countries in the world , wealthier than the @entity35 , @entity149 and @entity150 , and only the powers offered by a ‘ yes ’ vote will enable us to make this wealth work better for everyone in @entity7			2

joint declaration promises more financial powers if independence is blocked
@entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 have backed the deal
comes on the day of a tv debate between @entity14 and @entity19
@entity7 currently raises 15 per cent of its £ 30billion budget
