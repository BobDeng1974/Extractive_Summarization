children 's play is at risk from adults whio ' over-supervise ' and ' over-schedule ' a reports says children 's play is under threat from adults who ‘ over-supervise ’ and ‘ over-schedule ’ , a report says			1
it says youngsters can not develop normally and are ‘ play deprived ’ because of our risk - averse , regimented lifestyles			2
this means many lack vital skills such as resourcefulness , independence or self - regulation			2
the research , discussed on @entity30 ‘ play day ’ at the @entity31 yesterday , is the work of dr @entity25 , a senior lecturer in psychology of education at @entity28			1
he consulted researchers from across @entity33 and found children ’s leisure time is cut down by too much school work , safety fears , and lack of understanding of the impact of free play			1
his report , @entity43 , warns ‘ play provision is under threat in @entity33 ’ and adult intervention is often ‘ counter-productive ’			0
it says the @entity48 in particular is ‘ quite risk - averse ’ , with children ‘ heavily supervised ’ and forced to play indoors or in a garden or specially designed soft play area			1
this compares with the more rural @entity55 countries where children play independently in natural surroundings			1
just a generation ago , @entity48 children did the same , it adds			0
children have ‘ increasingly limited opportunities for the free play and association with their peers which were so commonly available			1
to their parents and grandparents , ’ the report says			0
life in big cities adds to the problem , making children ‘ much more heavily scheduled ’			0
living in big cities means children 's lives are more ' heavily scheduled ' and parents are reluctant to let them out to play poor children in cities can suffer from ‘ stressed parenting ’ and lack of access to the outdoors , while wealthier families may be overly cautious about dangers			1
the report states : ‘ children brought up in relatively affluent households may be over-scheduled and over-supervised as a consequence of perceptions of urban environments as dangerous for children , and a growing culture of risk - averse parenting			0
’ if lack of play becomes severe it can lead to ‘ abnormalities in neurological development ’			1
dr @entity25 writes that over-supervision is growing , with more and more parents worried about children playing outside due to traffic , crime , harassment and violence , abduction , and germs			0
there are also problems at school , with pressure to learn the curriculum and meet standards			0
children are not being allowed the freedom to play outside in natural environments , researchers said combined with curbs on free play at home , this leads to a ‘ worrying picture ’ across @entity33 , with ‘ a growing tendency to reduce play time in children ’s lives , both at school and home , in order to increase time for “ learning ” ’			2
the report recommends cities be organised ‘ with children in mind ’ , to enable them to play in the street and walk to school			2
informal outdoor activities should be encouraged at school , with longer breaks to encourage more physical activity			0
the @entity31 event was planned by the @entity140 of @entity33 , whose members include the @entity143 .			0

adults are ' over-supervising ' and ' over-scheduling ' children
