@entity6 considers the decision to attack then - president @entity16 's @entity8 administration ' a defining moment ' of his career , according to his lawsuit			1
' his brazen and successful handling of the crisis launched @entity6 to the forefront of his profession , ' said the legal filing , filed earlier this week and first reported on by the @entity25			0
in his book ' believer : my forty years in @entity29 , ' @entity1 takes credit for the plan to accuse president @entity16 's @entity32 of trying to sink @entity34 's re-election bid			1
@entity1 , @entity35 's senior campaign strategist in 2012 , is under fire on at least two fronts for claims he made in his new political memoir @entity40 was it ? @entity5 mayor @entity12 ( right ) swept to a re-election victory in 2003 after his campaign aides hatched a plot to blame @entity8 for alistening device the @entity10 planted in his office the @entity10 bugged @entity34 's office as part of a ' pay - to - play ' probe that led to the indictments of a city treasurer , a top street fundraiser and 10 others			1
the mayor himself was never charged and denied wrongdoing			0
@entity34 had initially been quiet about the bug found in his @entity61 office but went on the attack as the campaign claimed that @entity8 did it			0
weeks later , he won re-election in a landslide			0
@entity1 , in a statement , said his book does not rule out the possibility that other advisers ' arrived at the same conclusion or proceeded on parallel tracks			0
' but the lawsuit claims @entity1 was unreachable on the day @entity6 came up with the strategy – and later opposed it			2
@entity78 , mayor street 's 2003 campaign manager , submitted a statement with the suit saying that @entity1 eventually ' got on board ' and called @entity6 a ' hero			2
' @entity6 also sued @entity84 , @entity1 's publisher			0
it dismissed @entity6 's claims as ' utterly absurd			0
' @entity1 served as president @entity35 's chief campaign strategist in 2008 and 2012			2
now the founding director of the @entity90 at the @entity91 , @entity1 cut his political teeth at age 27 as a city hall correspondent and columnist at the @entity96			0
three years later he jumped to politics with a communications director job for sitting @entity100 senator @entity99			0
@entity102 's personal assistant @entity101 ( right ) saw and heard everything the @entity8 candidate said and did during the last presidential race , and he said @entity1 lied about the 2012 election night concession call to make the @entity8 look like a race - obsessed sore loser in addition to the @entity34 campaign , @entity1 later managed the re-election campaign of @entity113 , @entity114 's first black mayor , he later worked for then - senator @entity116 ' 2004 presidential campaign and latched on to @entity35 's 2008 effort			1
ultimately he became one of the president 's most senior advisers before departing the @entity121 in 2011			0
his career has also included political consulting for liberal candidates in @entity125 and @entity126			0
' believer : my forty years in @entity29 ' came out in mid-february and has already brought complaints from two people who say @entity1 lied in the memoir this year he 's consulting with @entity133 's @entity132 in advance of may 7 elections			1
@entity132 has said @entity1 is being paid a ' six - figure salary ' for his advice , and that he is working with @entity138 , @entity132 ’s shadow foreign secretary – largely via telephone conference calls			1
@entity34 case is the second claim that he lied in his memoir			0
the personal aide of one - time @entity8 presidential nominee @entity102 blasted him last month for writing that @entity102 had claimed president @entity35 's 2012 election victory was the product of an aggressive get - out - the - vote operation tageting blacks			1
@entity101 told @entity148 that @entity1 told a ' ridiculous ... lie ' about a phone call between @entity35 and @entity102 on @entity151			1
the @entity8 nominee , according to @entity1 's account , angered @entity35 when he called to concede the race – saying , ' you really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like @entity159 and @entity160			1
' that 's how @entity35 remembers it , @entity1 wrote			1
' in other words , black people , ' his book records the president as saying , ' that 's what he ( @entity102 ) thinks this was all about			2
' @entity101 claimed he was in the room listening to @entity102 's end of the conversation , and it never happened			2
separately , @entity1 made news in february with a speech at the @entity176 by claiming that the @entity35 presidency has seen ' six years in which there has n’t been a major scandal			2
' that claim drew a mix of applause and laughter from his audience .			0

@entity1 took credit in his memoir for a plan blaming @entity8 dirty - *tricksters* for a listening device the @entity10 planted in a @entity5 mayor 's office as part of a *criminal* probe
but another @entity13 operative claims it was all his idea – and @entity1 thought it was a *bad* one
it 's the second time the @entity35 *confidant* 's book has been *branded* *dishonest*
a @entity102 aide said last month that @entity1 lied when he wrote that the @entity8 candidate suggested on @entity206 that @entity35 only won because his *outreach* targeted black voters
@entity1 has a long career in @entity13 politics and landed a six - figure consulting contract with @entity133 's @entity132 during this year 's elections
