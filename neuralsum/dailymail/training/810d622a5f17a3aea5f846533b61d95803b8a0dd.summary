the fast and furious spree included $ 11,750 for a trip to @entity19 , $ 69,000 on furniture and a $ 7,100 deposit on a swimming pool - causing a legal battle to be set off this week between @entity2 and her father - in - law over what 's left in the estate of the @entity29 basketball legend - who earned more than $ 55 million during his career			1
scroll down for @entity31 @entity11 , the ex-wife of slain @entity3 basketball player @entity2 , grieves at the casket of @entity2 during a memorial service at the @entity34 in @entity29 , in august 2010 @entity3 star @entity2 was found murdered at the age of 34 in @entity29 and his wife @entity11 , 41 , is now involved in a legal battle with his father over his sons estate as part of @entity41 filed in january 2010 as part of her divorce against @entity2 , @entity11 demanded that he take out a $ 1 million life insurance policy for the benefit of his sons and daughters in the event of his death			1
the divorce was finalized in february 2010 and in july , @entity2 , who was 34 at the time of his death was found in a deserted area of southeast @entity29 riddled with gunshots - the murder remains unsolved almost three years later			0
records show that @entity11 spent $ 32,000 on a @entity58 , $ 339,000 to buy and improve a new house , $ 5,000 for lawn equipment , $ 180,000 in property expenses , $ 2,273 on ' spring outfits for girls ' and almost $ 2,000 on birthday party and gifts for ' @entity66 ' the spending report has triggered @entity66 's father , @entity68 , to launch a legal battle for control of his grandchildren 's inheritance			1
' she had no authority to spend that money like that , ' said @entity77 , @entity68 's attorney to the @entity78			2
however , records show that @entity11 has spent the majority of the money on her children - a 5,300 square - foot - home , purchased in june is titled in a trust for her four sons and two daughters			1
$ 339,000 on new property which she placed in her children 's name $ 32,000 for a @entity58 : $ 26,000 on a @entity89 $ 11,750 for a lavish trip to @entity19 $ 7,500 for a new swimming pool as a deposit $ 69,000 for new furniture in her home $ 5,000 for a motorized lawnmower the spending report , filed in september but only just now released publicly , caused @entity9 probate judge @entity98 to begin investigation into the living circumstances of @entity2 's children			1
the judge has also re-directed the $ 184,000 in death benefits the @entity3 pays out to the children and placed it under the control of @entity68 for the benefit of the six kids - but froze the assets for the duration of the legal fight			1
countering the freezing of the @entity3 money , @entity11 has argued in legal filings that @entity115 has a history of mismanagement of his son 's finances and recounted testimony in which he reportedly said last fall that he had ' no particular experience ' in financial management and his involvement ' had been limited to writing checks and paying bills , at his son 's direction			1
' ' he denied ever writing any checks from the account to himself or for his benefit , and he denied ever misappropriating any of his son 's funds , ' said @entity11 's attorney @entity135 in the released court filings			2
@entity68 and @entity11 's multi-million dollar legal fight has become public after a court revealed new details about the @entity3 widow 's extravagant spending ' he admitted that his son had discharged him and he had therefore ceased handling any of his son 's financial matters before his son 's death			1
' however , despite the extravagant spending , the legal documents reveal that @entity11 and her children remain financially solvent , listing nearly $ 1.4 million in ' assets on hand ' including significant investment properties in @entity153			2

the divorce came through in february 2010 and on july 28th , @entity2 's decomposed body was discovered in southeast @entity29 showing evidence of being shot multiple times			2
@entity167 ( 42 ) was found dead on july 28th in @entity29 after going missing nine days previous			0
