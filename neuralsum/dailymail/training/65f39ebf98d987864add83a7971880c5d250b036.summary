@entity0 , 29 , was self - employed and so could not sue @entity11 's @entity10 nightclub , the @entity8 ruled			1
and miss @entity0 , of @entity12 , west @entity11 , was compared to a church organist in her fight to be a recognised employee			1
employment law specialist @entity16 , a partner at law firm @entity18 , said : ' strippers and church organists do not generally have a great deal in common , but this case brings the two together because exactly the same legal principles are at stake			1
' there have been a number of recent cases where church organists have brought similar actions , claiming unfair dismissal when removed from their post and basing their arguments about being employees , like @entity0 , on the level of control exercised over their work			1
' as in @entity0 ’s case , the @entity37 would look at the degree of control the club owners or the church ministers exercise , directing when and what music to play or where and when to dance			1
' miss @entity0 is now set to continue her case in the highest court of the land - appealing to the @entity47			2
today 's decision overturned a previous ruling by the @entity50 that @entity51 was employed by @entity3 because the club imposed contractual obligations on her			2
miss @entity0 had alleged that she had to work set days and attend meetings at the club - or face being fined			1

while working she had to be on standby ready to perform free pole dances whenever summoned by the @entity66 miss @entity0 also claimed she had to perform free dances for customers ' on the hour every hour ' whenever the @entity71 song ' @entity69 ' was played			2
she said she could be fined £ 10 for each part of a song or whole song that she missed			0

and she had to get a manager 's approval for ' any agreement with a customer worth more than £ 300 to the dance '			0
at the end of each night , the club had to give miss @entity0 cash for the vouchers she accumulated - minus its fees and commissions and any fines			1
but @entity3 revealed to the court how miss @entity0 actually paid them £ 65 a night - and ended up out of pocket if the club was quiet and punters refused to tip. it argued that her working terms were allegedly so miserly that she was ' often ' paying the club to let her strip there rather than vice versa			1
lawyers @entity3 argued @entity0 was not an employee because she had no obligation to work there court of appeal judge @entity105 today ruled that the eat made a ' plain error ' in concluding that @entity3 ' obligations to @entity51 amounted to a contract of employment			2
