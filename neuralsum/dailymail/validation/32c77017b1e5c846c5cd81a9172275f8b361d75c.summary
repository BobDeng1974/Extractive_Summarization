@entity1 manager @entity0 has reassured @entity2 that the door is still open to a senior @entity5 call - up if his rise to stardom continues			1
@entity2 has emerged as one of the most exciting young strikers in the country alongside @entity12 ’s @entity11 this season , and has been linked with moves to @entity15 and @entity16 when his contract at @entity1 runs out in the summer			1
but while @entity11 was called up for the first time on thursday when @entity19 named his squad to face @entity21 and @entity22 at the end of the month , @entity2 had to be satisfied with a place in the under - 21 party			1
@entity1 striker @entity2 was left out of @entity19 's @entity5 squad despite his recent good form @entity2 ' manager at club level , @entity0 , said he is sure @entity2 is in @entity5 's thoughts and told him to push on the young striker has become a big part of the @entity5 under 21 set up and is in @entity34 's squad ‘ i ’m not surprised , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’d like to think he ’s in their thoughts and in and around their thinking			2
‘ there are lots of other players out there doing well			2
obviously the main one is @entity11			1
‘ i would certainly promote them to continue monitoring him because i think he ’s got a freshness to the way he plays and is different to a lot of centre - forwards who would be considered			2
‘ we ’ve enjoyed what he ’s doing here and he ’s definitely learning			2
that ’s the big thing when you ’re a young player , and particularly playing at this level			2
are you getting used to it ? are you learning ? overall he has			0
‘ there are no guarantees			0
it ’s for @entity19 and his staff to decide			1
as long as he keeps progressing , he ’ll certainly always be in their thinking			0
’ @entity2 ' contract at @entity61 expires at the end of the season but @entity0 wants him to push on for @entity1 the @entity1 boss was not surprised to see @entity2 left out of the senior set - up considering the depth of forwards @entity2 ’s strike partner @entity68 has been recalled to the @entity70 squad for the first time in more than a year for their @entity73 qualifier against @entity75 , just a few days after making his first @entity77 appearance for @entity1 in last weekend ’s surprise win over @entity16			1
@entity68 , 25 , missed the first five months of the season with a knee injury and @entity0 admits the player is still getting back to his best			1
he added : ‘ i ’m sure judging by how @entity68 operated last week that he ’s well and truly on his way to full match fitness			0
i do n’t expect it to happen overnight , it ’s down to the game time we can give him when we think it ’s appropriate			0
@entity19 opted for @entity11 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 as his strikers @entity2 and @entity11 ( right ) are key members of the side for @entity34 ( left ) ahead of the @entity96 ‘ i spoke to @entity97 ( @entity98 ) and let him know where he was at			1
i said it was touch and go whether he started ( against @entity16 ) , and i did start him			0
‘ i still think there is more to come from him – that true match fitness that can only come from games – so we ’ll try and be wise with that			0
‘ it ’s important with a player ’s recovery to be given time			0
that has paid itself back with a reasonable , if not a good performance actually , last week			0
there is still more to come as he gets used to this level and the sharpness returns			0
’ @entity68 has been named in @entity70 ' squad for their upcoming games after over a year out of the set - up @entity68 has been rewarded for his good form with @entity1 , including playing in the win over @entity16			1
