for anyone packing for their holidays this year , getting their clothes to fit neatly inside their bags is always a struggle			2
but robotics engineers have now come up with what they say is the best way to fold a variety of clothes into neat little rectangles			1
their findings , of course , are intended to help a new generation of robots take on some of our more monotonous household chores			1
the diagram above shows the approach outlined by the scientists for folding a jumper or long sleeved t - shirt however , their work has also revealed the most effective ways of folding clothing so it can be stacked and packed away that may also help humans too			1
they use a principal that they have called the ' g-fold ' - where clothing is laid out on a flat surface and gravity is used to help assist the folding of clothing			1
it could be the ultimate home help - able to find your dirty clothes , wash them , and even fold them before neatly putting them away			2
the robot developed by researchers at the @entity45 is able to wash and fold clothes , recognise different items so they can be folded neatly away			1
using @entity50 's $ 280,000 @entity49 , the researchers have been able to get their robot to take washing out oa basket , place them in a washer			2
the semi-humanoid robot is ' roughly the size of a person ' and features two arms , claw - like ' gripper ' hands , a front - facing screen head , and a tilting @entity62 laser scanner that continuously flaps up and down like an ever - chattering mouth			0
for a jumper , for example , they suggest folding the sleeves in half first at the elbow and then folding them in at the shoulders			0
they then suggest folding the body of the jumper into the middle from both sides before then folding it in half			0
with a pair of trousers they suggest folding them along the crotch and then down the middle			2
the approach is published in a research paper describing how domestic robots can help around the home			0
dr @entity87 , an associate professor in computer science at the @entity45 , and his colleagues who have been conducting the research , said they attempted to solve the problem of folding clothing by treating it as a problem of geometry			1
they said : ' spread crudley on a table , real - world clothing items do not perfectly resemble simple polygons			0
' they contain curves rather than straight lines , corners which are rounded rather than sharp , and small intricacies which no two articles of a given class will necessarily share			0
' rather than reason explicitly about these complex shapes , we wish to transpose them as best we can into a shape which we know how to fold			0
' the researchers have now used their findings to help develop a robot that is able to sort and fold laundry			1
they developed software that allowed the @entity117 to grip clothes with claw like gripper hands and lay it out on a flat surface			1
this is the technique the engineers recommended for folding up a standard t - shirt into a neat rectangle folding a pair of trousers or jeans requires just the simplest of folds shown above according to the research the approach outlined above shows how the researchers recommend folding a variety of different clothing the researchers have written software that enables a robot to fold clothing into neat rectangles ( shown above ) it is then able to assess them best way of folding the clothing based on its shape			1
using cameras and shape recognition software , the robot is able to recognise where folds should be made and use its grippers to perform them			0
in a series of tests they found the robot was able to fold up to 40 different articles of clothing , including trousers , towels , sweaters and t - shirts			1
for a t - shirt , for example , they calculated it required just five folds , while a jumper requires seven folds			0
folding a towel might seem simple but for a robot it requires the ability to use some complex geometry writing in a paper in a new journal on @entity179 , the researchers said : ' the g-fold method worked reasonably well on pants			1
' it was also able to fold a collared shirt quite neatly , despite that its rigid collar and buttons are not expressible in the language of our model			0
' they did warn , however , that the thickness of the cloth could interfere with the folding and in order to achieve truly neat folds it may be necessary to use an iron			2
their approach contrasts with other suggest folding methods			0
recently an approach known as the @entity203 folding method , where a t - shirt is folded by gripping just two points on the cloth , has become popular			1
others , such as researchers at the @entity209 , have recommended packing bags using the bundle method			0
this , they claim , allows clothes to be bundled into a relatively small bag without while minimising the number of creases they have			0
those of a more military background , however , often prefer an approach known as ' ranger rolling ' where clothes are rolled up into tight little bundles			0
however dr @entity87 and his team said : ' while this study dealt explicitly with the task of laundry folding , we believe the tools put forth may generalize well beyond this to many deformable object manipulation challenges , such as ironing or bed - making			1
' we hope that these results will provide another step forward on the long road toward the utopian future , where humans are never again nagged to " do their chores			2

engineers at @entity45 assessed folding techniques
they conducted the work to help develop robots that can do the laundry
they recommend using a ' g-fold ' where clothes are folded on a flat surface
t - shirts , jumpers and trousers can be folded with this into neat rectangles
researchers hope it will lead to robots that can take on household chores
