astronomers fully expected @entity1 to meet a fiery death – and with good reason			1
after all , it was about to fly through the @entity6 ’s atmosphere where temperatures reach a staggering @entity8			2
but this week stargazers were astonished when the 660 - foot - wide icy rock disappeared around the back side of the sun , coming within 87,000 miles of its surface , and emerged triumphantly out the other side			1
this was the comet that lived			0
what ’s more , @entity19 ’s @entity18 caught the great escape on camera			1
’ @entity29 was only discovered on november 27 this year and was named after the amateur @entity39 astronomer who spotted it , @entity29			0
it is classed as a ‘ @entity42 ’ , which is a class of comet whose orbit comes very close to the @entity6 they are named after the 19th - century @entity48 astronomer @entity47 , who figured out that they are actually the remains of one huge comet that broke apart			1
soon after @entity29 was found three separate space agencies excitedly began tracking its trajectory – @entity19 , the @entity54 and the @entity55			0
its fate was quickly marked as doomed because it would rush headlong into the @entity6 ’s hellish corona			2
age : 4.5billion years distance from @entity60 : 92million miles diameter : 865,000 miles ( in comparison the @entity60 is 7926 miles ) temperature at core : @entity64 composition : @entity66 ( 73 per cent ) , helium ( 25 per cent ) and the rest is carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and iron writing on the @entity76 website , @entity74 scientist @entity73 said : ‘ we have here an exceptionally rare opportunity to observe the complete vaporization of a relatively large comet , and we have approximately 18 instruments on five different satellites that are trying to do just that			1
’ however , @entity29 had other ideas and in a brief , but very clear , clip can be seen zooming away to safety from the @entity6 ’s fiery clutches			0
@entity89 , from the @entity90 , was stunned by @entity29 's close encounter			0
he told @entity92 : ‘ it was an extraordinary event			1
@entity29 was incredibly close to the @entity6 , closer to the @entity6 than the @entity60 is to the @entity94			1
‘ and it ’s certainly a pretty rare event			0
the @entity97 [ note : the video is from the @entity18 ] has seen many examples of comets being destroyed as they approached the @entity6 and there was a great deal of interest in this because there was an expectation of spectacular debris			2
@entity19 's @entity18 captured @entity1 's ' brush with death ' - astronomers predicted the comet would be destroyed , but it survived ‘ i suppose if something is big and tough enough it will survive			1
this event tells us that the comet was rather more robust than expected			2
doubtless it had a very rough ride though ! ’ mr @entity89 explained that comets have probably survived skirmishes with the @entity6 before , but we just have n’t been able to see them			0
‘ it just shows how good the technology is now , ’ he added .			0

@entity1 was expected to vaporize but the 660 - foot - wide rock was *filmed* making a great escape
' it was an extraordinary event ' said one astronomer
the comet came closer to the @entity6 than the @entity60 is to the @entity94
