by @entity0 published : 00:52 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 11:39 est , 3 august 2013 no one expected @entity2 to go quietly			2
the controversial @entity4 third baseman hit a towering home run friday during a minor league rehab game and then took a few swings at the @entity4 while addressing the media about the possibility of a long suspension or lifetime ban from baseball stemming from the @entity15 performance enhancing drug scandal , even saying fans will be the ones who suffer if he is banished			1
‘ i am mentally prepared to play for five more years , ’ the slugger defiantly said after the game			2
‘ it ’s not time for me to hang it up , i have a lot more left in me			0
alluding to the belief that he is being singled out by @entity38 , @entity2 said ‘ i think it ’s pretty self - explanatory			1
i think that ’s the pink elephant in the room , ’ before adding that he agrees the game needs to be rid of @entity45			0
@entity2 admitted to using steroids while with the @entity47 , but has denied using peds since joining the @entity4 in 2004			1
‘ i will say this , there ’s more than one party that benefits from me never stepping back on the field			0
that ’s not my teammates and not the @entity4 fans , ’ said @entity2			1
the latest allegations claim the 14 - time all - star used @entity45 as far back as at least 2009 , possibly further			0
but @entity2 did n’t stop there , with his next comments aimed squarely at the @entity4 , the team that owes him more than $ 100million over the next four years			1
out with a bang ! : @entity2 admires what may be the last home run he hits as a professional ball player friday night during a rehab game with the minor league @entity35 ‘ but when all this stuff is going on in the background , and people are finding creative ways to cancel your contract , that ’s concerning for me , concerning for present and i think it should be concerning for future players , as well , ’ said @entity2			1
his comments came after his first minor league rehab game as he races to come back from both off - season hip surgery and a strained quad before @entity38 commissioner @entity80 suspends him , which reports indicate will happen no later than next week			2
stepping onto the field , there was an even mixture of boos and cheers from the 8,000 - plus crowd on hand against the @entity90 , a minor league affiliate of the @entity91			2
@entity2 attributed the @entity93 cheer to his role in helping the @entity4 beat the @entity91 in the @entity95			1
‘ i think there were a lot of @entity91 fans out there , and they do n't have good memories from me , ’ said @entity2 , perhaps half - jokingly			1
soaking it up : @entity2 gestures to the crowd as rounds the bases after his monster home run the suspension hanging over @entity2 is a result of his alleged involvement with @entity15 , a @entity111 anti-aging clinic @entity38 investigators have accused of selling @entity45 such as steroids and human growth hormone to a list of athletes long enough field an all - star team on its own			1
varying reports say anywhere from eight to 14 other players are expected to be suspended in connection with @entity15			0
the suspensions were due to be announced by the end of this week , but the latest reports say the axe will fall in the next two or three days			0
at the same time , the @entity4 have publicly stated their plan is to have the 19 - year veteran @entity2 in their lineup monday against the @entity131			1
‘ i think it ’s possible , yeah , ’ manager @entity132 said when asked if the embattled slugger would return to the lineup			0
@entity2 was a bit more jovial in his answer to the same question , saying he ’d be in the lineup ‘ unless i get hit by lightning , and these days you never know			1
’ you lie ! : fans let the alleged steroid cheat know how they really felt , both with boos and signs held before , during and after the game @entity2 was set to join the @entity4 in july when his strained quad delayed his return to the @entity93 , an injury he openly contested in the media			1
the move backfired when the doctor his handlers picked turned out to have been in trouble with @entity155 officials earlier this year			0
@entity2 , in the end , accepted the rehabilitation assignment , friday ’s game in @entity159 was the first game of his assigned rehab			2
the league ’s highest - paid player , at $ 28million per season , it has been widely reported since at least last season that the @entity4 were trying to figure out how to get out from under the ill - advised contract owing him more than $ 100 million over the next four seasons			2
on his way : @entity2 said he will be back with the @entity4 for monday 's game against the @entity131 in @entity169 , unless he 's ' struck by lightning ' current @entity172 manager @entity171 – himself a former @entity4 manager – went so far as to say the league is perhaps even conspiring with the team to deal with @entity2 , saying that if the @entity4 are allowed to ‘ get away with that , ’ they will go on another spending spree snagging big name free agents as they have in the past			1
there are two schools of thought on what @entity80 may do with @entity2			0
one has him using the ‘ best interest of the game ’ power afforded him as commissioner to ban the suspected cheater for life			0
the other has @entity80 and @entity2 agreeing to a settlement that would see the beleaguered player sit out the rest of this season and all of 2014 , which at 38 years old , would effectively end @entity2 ’s career			2
@entity80 ’s endgame is to have @entity2 never step on the field again , @entity2 sees a different outcome			0
‘ i ’m ready to go			0
i feel 100 % , ’ @entity2 said			0
‘ a night like tonight illustrates to me that i can play now and i can play for a long time			0
