voters are still ' in the dark ' about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day , economic experts warned today			1
analysts from the @entity8 said none of the major parties had given ' anything like full details ' on how they will tackle the nations ' debts after the election			2
the @entity16 were accused of giving ' no detail ' about their deficit reduction plan , which relies on £ 30billion of cuts , while @entity20 has left the door open to borrowing an extra £ 26billion - a - year			1
the think - tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of may 's general election			2
it accused @entity38 chancellor @entity37 and his @entity20 opponent @entity39 of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall			1
@entity8 deputy director @entity42 said : ' there are genuinely big differences between the main parties ' fiscal plans			2
' the electorate has a real choice , although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice			0
' conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than @entity20 plans			2
' but they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases			1
' while @entity20 has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition , its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year			1
' chancellor @entity37 and his @entity20 opponent @entity39 are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit @entity37 received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly £ 3 billion			1
borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was £ 87.3 billion for the year to the end of march , down from £ 98.5 billion in 2013/14 , according to the @entity75 ( @entity75 )			1
the result undershot the latest target of £ 90.2 billion set by the independent @entity78 ( @entity78 ) at the time of last month 's budget			0
it means that annual borrowing ( gdp ) has fallen by more than £ 60 billion from £ 153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the @entity84 came to power			0
as a percentage of gross domestic product ( gdp ) it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent			0
however , underlying debt of £ 1.48 trillion is more than £ 500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of £ 956 billion			0
the nation 's debt represents 80.4 per cent of @entity83 , up from 62 per cent five years ago			0
the @entity8 analysis said the @entity16 planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next @entity28			2
it said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this			1
research economist @entity102 said : ' the conservatives have said they want to eliminate the deficit but provided next to no detail on how they would do it			0
' they should be forthcoming on the £ 5 billion of largely unspecified clampdown on tax avoidance , the £ 10 billion of unspecified cuts to social security spending and , according to our calculations , further real cuts to unprotected departments of around £ 30 billion			2
' turning to @entity20 , the @entity8 said the @entity116 had been ' considerably more vague ' about how much it wants to borrow			1
the pledge to produce a surplus but without specifying by when or how much could be consistent with a reduction in borrowing totalling 3.6 per cent of national income			0
senior research economist @entity122 said : ' @entity20 's proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest			1
' but this would leave borrowing at £ 26billion a year in today 's terms			1
' if @entity20 wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there			1
' the @entity8 said the @entity134 had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017 - 18 , revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than @entity20 but less than the conservatives			1
the @entity137 's figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as @entity20 , the @entity8 said , although the reduction would be slower			1
this means the @entity137 is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity , the think - tank said			0
the independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy , with @entity20 accusing the @entity16 of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world 's advanced economies and the @entity38 renewing warnings that @entity152 's economy would suffer from an ' @entity137 / @entity154 nightmare '			1
@entity20 's shadow chancellor @entity39 said : ' the @entity8 has confirmed that the @entity16 are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party , with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years			1
' the @entity16 might be able to make the cuts but the last five years show they will fail to cut the deficit as they claim			0
they have borrowed £ 200 billion more than they planned because their failure to boost living standards has led to tax revenues falling short			0
' but mr @entity37 today warned that every family in the country will be left £ 350 worse off if the @entity137 is left calling the shots in a @entity20 government			1
the chancellor warned of a ' dangerous cocktail ' if @entity154 is at the mercy of @entity137 leader @entity171			0
with polls showing no party will win an overall majority , mr @entity37 claimed it would spark a ' constitutional crisis ' if @entity178 nationalist mps held the balance of power in the @entity152 government			2
launching the @entity137 manifesto this week , ms @entity171 named her price for supporting @entity20 in any post-election deal			0
she demanded her mps have a say over the running of the whole of the @entity152 , raising the prospect of @entity178 nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border			0
and she unveiled a £ 140billion ' ransom note ' for @entity152 to drag @entity20 to the left , including an end to austerity , rising benefits payments and the abolition of @entity199 as the price mr @entity154 would have to pay for getting into @entity201			2
mr @entity37 seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that @entity206 analysis suggests it would add £ 6billion to @entity152 's interest bill , worth £ 350 per family			1
mr @entity37 told @entity209 's today programme : ' it 's a new feature of this election that a @entity20 can not win an overall majority , so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of @entity216			2
' we 've got a strong plan for a national recovery , but it 's perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what @entity222 described last night as ' constitutional chaos '			0
' the @entity226 leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a @entity20 minority government propped up by them			0
' @entity229 , chief executive of the @entity230 , said : ' the politicians seeking our votes owe it to taxpayers to come clean about what spending the country can , and can not , afford			0
' this candour has so far been noticeably absent in the election campaign , with politicians failing to acknowledge the dire state of the public finances and instead clambering over each other to make additional and apparently unfunded spending pledges			0
' conservatives labour @entity134 @entity245 greens			0
