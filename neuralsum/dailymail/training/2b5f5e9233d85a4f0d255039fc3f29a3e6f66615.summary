the prime minister said the @entity9 needs to ‘ say no ’ to the current situation , which sees half of workers in many factories coming from abroad			1
poor training and school standards mean young @entity9 do not have the skills and qualifications to compete , he said			2
he told apprentices at a @entity4 factory in @entity28 he did not blame ‘ hard - working ’ @entity29 for travelling here , nor employers for hiring them			1
but because our education system has failed many school - leavers and the welfare system has not incentivised work , @entity9 are often a cut below other workers , he said			1
‘ immigration , welfare and education are totally linked , ’ said mr @entity2			1
‘ you go round factories in our country and half the people have come from @entity46 or @entity47 or @entity48			2
you ca n’t blame them			0
‘ they see the jobs , they come over and they do them			0
but as a country what we ought to be saying is “ no ”			0
’ he said : ‘ let ’s get our education system right so we are producing young people out of our schools and colleges who are fully capable of doing the jobs			2
second , let ’s reform the welfare system so that it does n’t pay to be out of work			0
and third , let ’s have sensible controls on immigration			0
‘ crack those three problems together and we ’ll create an economy that really generates wealth for all our people			0
’ the comments come weeks after @entity72 mayor @entity71 backed chef @entity73 , who suggested many young @entity9 were ‘ lazy ’ and ‘ wet behind the ears ’			1
speech : the prime minister said he did not blame foreign workers for coming to the @entity9 to look for jobs and this summer , civil society minister @entity79 said some young people lacked the ‘ grit ’ and social skills to get a job			1
yesterday , skills minister @entity84 said : ‘ we have a record number of jobs in this country and we ’ve got to make sure that as people leave school , they are in a position to take those jobs			2
‘ and likewise employers should look at local young people			2
i do n’t blame the employers at all – my job is to make sure that young people have got what it takes			0
’ he said a recent study showed @entity9 was ‘ the only country in the world where 65 - year - olds have better skills than those who have left school in the last few years ’			2
scheme : mr @entity2 is seeking to promote apprenticeships to help @entity9 workers ' prospects mr @entity2 defended the government ’s controversial work experience scheme , in which people do internships in return for benefits			1
he said : ‘ getting people into the workplace , giving them experience of work , of timekeeping and all the things it means to have a job is a really good way to help get people started			0
’ he added : ‘ the danger for a country like @entity9 is yes , you see the economy recover , yes you see jobs coming , but you leave behind people who have not got the right qualifications from school			1
‘ i do n’t want that to happen in our country			0
’ the prime minister spoke as more than 60 leading firms – including @entity4 ’s owners @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 – signed up to deliver new , tougher apprenticeship schemes , which will last at least a year and include maths and @entity150 tests			1
