by @entity0 published : 16:55 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 16:56 est , 20 april 2013 as environment secretary , @entity1 has already upset animal rights activists with his strong support for a badger cull to halt the spread of @entity6 to cattle			1
now the @entity9 mp – whose role includes responsibility for wildlife – is set to provoke controversy after being photographed proudly holding specialist traps containing the bodies of dead grey squirrels that were damaging trees on his estate in @entity20			1
@entity9 colleagues who have visited the cabinet minister ’s mansion near @entity24 have been shocked to see him showing off a photograph of himself holding a squirrel trap in each hand			1
controversy : @entity1 has been photographed holding specialist traps containing the bodies of dead grey squirrels the dead animals ’ heads are inside the devices , while their bodies and bushy tails hang limply below			1
‘ i ’m not sure what was more shocking – the dead squirrels or the smile on @entity1 ’s face , ’ said one conservative who has seen the picture			1
‘ if the animal rights mob saw it they would have a fit			1
@entity1 insisted that we look at the photo and then he said , “ look at this – these traps are the real deal			1
no squirrel is going to get out of that			1
” ‘ everyone laughed but i felt embarrassed			1
@entity1 said the squirrels had inflicted terrible damage to his trees			2
’ right - winger @entity1 , 56 , who is married to aristocrat ’s daughter @entity60 and has been tipped as a future @entity63 leader , is thought to have installed a number of the @entity66 traps in the grounds of his home			1
they cost about £ 60 each and are , according to the manufacturers , ‘ by far the most powerful spring trap available in the @entity72 ’			2
they can be attached to trees , placed in lofts or left on the ground			2
the makers recommend using peanuts or peanut butter as bait to lure the squirrels inside			2
the animals are then crushed in an instant			2
lethal : the @entity85 traps , pictured in action , are described as ' by far the most powerful spring trap available in the @entity72 ' there is no suggestion that mr @entity1 has done anything illegal			1
unlike the endangered red squirrel – which is extinct in most parts of the @entity72 – grey squirrels are officially classed as vermin			2
they are known to damage trees and gardens , and also roofs as they try to gain access to attics			0
the @entity66 was originally developed in @entity101 for the fur trade			0
it was made legal in the @entity72 in 1993 for use against grey squirrels , mink , stoats , weasels , mice and rats			0
vermin : @entity113 squirrels are officially classed as vermin and cause damage to trees and gardens @entity85 ’s @entity72 website says it is ‘ one of the safest and most humane traps in the world – perfect for the grey squirrel			1
although a little on the expensive side it is well worth having a few in the armoury			0
‘ it is suitable for people wanting to trap squirrels in their gardens but do not want to have to dispatch the squirrel themselves			0
’ the website advises : ‘ for the best results pre-bait for up to a week before actually setting the trap			0
' this gets all the local squirrels used to eating at the trap and they lose all fear of it , even if they see another of their kind dead in it			0
’ @entity85 ’s @entity101 website also features an article by a farmer in @entity144 who describes how installing the traps stopped squirrels destroying his fruit crop			1
the man , who insisted on remaining anonymous because he is ‘ not sure this method of trapping is legal ’ , says : ‘ folks , the @entity153 trap works as advertised			0
i have been plagued by “ fuzzy tails ” for years			0
then the @entity156 ’s @entity155 smiled upon me			0
' i spotted an advert for the @entity66			0
since then i have sent about 70 fuzzy tails to that great walnut tree in the sky			0
it is humane and efficient – i ’ve never had a miss. ’ a spokesman for mr @entity1 said : ‘ programmes for the humane control of grey squirrels have been in place in the @entity72 for more than 40 years			0
these programmes protect our woodland and wildlife			0
