primary school children have been told to wear only socks for lessons after shoes were banned in an attempt to improve children 's results			1
@entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , declared that children should study barefoot after the school 's ' @entity11 ' , made up of @entity14 pupils , found that ' shoeless classrooms ' could help pupils learn			1
after a trial , which was deemed successful by children and staff , the 240 - pupil school 's governors agreed to make the policy official , and @entity23 became a ' shoeless school ' in january this year			1
socks : @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity26 , adopted ' shoeless classroom ' policy in january the unusual philosophy , which originated in @entity30 , where shoes bring in slush , snow and ice , suggests that children both learn and behave better when their feet are unrestricted by shoes			1
pupils are said to be gentler with each other , concentrate better , and other benefits include cleaner and more hygienic carpets			0
pupils at @entity43 , which is deemed ' good ' by @entity44 , are allowed to go barefoot or to wear socks and slippers whenever they are in the school building , and only put on school shoes when they head outdoors to play			2
headmistress @entity49 said : ' @entity51 classrooms were brought in to improve the learning environment			1
' however children and staff discovered one downside of shoeless learning last week when a fire alarm sounded and the children had to file out onto the wet playground in their socks			1
some parents and carers were upset that the children got their feet wet as a result , with one grandmother of a five - year - old at the school saying : ' it ’s absolutely ridiculous			2
' @entity70 pupils were ushered out of the door without their shoes , and my grandson was stood there on a soaking wet playground in just his socks			2
shoeless learning originated in @entity30 , and is said to promote better learning and behaviour ( file pic ) ' when they came back into the school , they had to take their socks off , so when we went to collect the kids nearly all of them came out wearing shoes and no socks			2
' she added : ' it is just disgusting			0
there are so many health hazards about kids walking about in socks on the wooden floors and chair legs slamming on their feet , but the reassurance we ’ve been given is that posters are no longer stuck on walls with drawing pins			0
' even in hospitals you ’re not allowed to walk about barefoot because of health and safety implications			0
' headteacher @entity49 said : ' the children ’s safety is of the utmost importance , which is why we evacuated the building			0
' during the afternoon , children with wet socks or tights were given spare dry ones and theirs were dried			0
' she added : ' @entity51 classrooms have nothing to do with [ protecting ] the carpet tiles - we have n’t had any new carpets fitted since 2007			0

@entity7 adopted ' shoeless classroom ' policy in january
theory suggests pupils learn and behave better when not in their shoes
' @entity133 ' theory is @entity30 , but why it works is *unknown*
the primary in @entity8 , @entity26 , ran a successful trial last year
head @entity49 , said the idea is to ' improve learning environment '
but a fire alarm during *friday* 's rain meant pupils *trooped* outside in socks
one carer said : ' my five - year - old grandson stood in the wet in just socks '
