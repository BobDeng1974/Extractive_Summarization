standing in @entity0 – the large square which spreads out at the heart of @entity2 – i am momentarily unsure what year it is			1
behind me , the @entity5 is a swarthy slice of the 19th century – an @entity8 temple competing for souls with the 16th century @entity10 , which sits a few doors down			1
in front , the broad facade of the @entity14 department store is an austere reminder of the grim communist fifties – even as it towers over the archaeological remains of the @entity20 settlement of @entity21 , which are framed beyond glass at my feet			1
only when the adjacent metro station bursts into life , disgorging a crowd of commuters , does the 21st century seem to feel present and correct			1
a church to haunt a million postcards : the magnificent @entity31 is @entity2 's landmark @entity34 's capital is rarely anybody 's first suggestion for a mini-break			1
but , easily reached via a three - hour ( direct ) flight from @entity40 , it is deserving of closer attention – not least because few cities wear their past quite as openly as this fascinating little corner of eastern @entity45			1
just about every dominant power that ever thrived on our home continent – ancient @entity49 , road - building @entity50 , @entity51 , the heavy hand of the @entity53 – has had its say here at some point			1
the result is an intriguing cocktail of architectural styles and overlapping eras that is certain to delight more intrepid travellers			1
exploring the centre , i soon encounter the @entity31			1
indeed , it is hard to miss @entity2 ’s keynote building			1
it is the sort of dreaming wonder of a church that , were it located in @entity69 , @entity70 or @entity71 , would gaze out from a million postcards			2
in truth , it looks like it has escaped from @entity76 – an epic , domed creation that was built between 1878 and 1912 , at a time when @entity34 was in thrall to @entity80			1
its flanks are adorned with mosaics – while its interior , where the aroma of incense hangs thick in the air , is a feast of space			2
it has a neighbour too , the smaller @entity92 – a humble red - brick pile that , remarkably , has occupied its site since the sixth century			2
inside , medieval frescoes supply colour and beauty , saints peering piously at the observer			2
unknown quantity : @entity2 is one of @entity45 's most historic cities , but is rarely on the tourist map @entity2 loves its churches – but it also revels in culture			1
the @entity108 , with its 3500 - strong cluster of contemporary works , is a treasure trove			2
yet the motherlode is the @entity111			2
pitched inside a former royal palace , this is a pleasing place to spend an afternoon , its many paintings hung in high - ceilinged chambers where the affairs of court once played out			2
the names of the painters whose pieces decorate the walls will not , perhaps , be familiar – but the striking landscapes and rural scenes crafted by @entity34 luminaries like @entity126 and @entity127 are eye - catching nonetheless			1
somewhat bizarrely , the @entity128 is hidden four miles south - west of the centre , in the suburb of @entity131			2
you need to take a taxi to reach it – but the inconvenience is offset by the collection that awaits			2
@entity34 ’s full tale is revealed here			1
the priceless @entity137 – a clutch of gold goblets from the fourth century @entity140 – recalls the days when the area was part of the ancient @entity49 region of @entity144			0
crusader swords and @entity147 weaponry tell military stories of different vintages			0
and the building regales you with the most dramatic yarn of all			0
this sturdy block of concrete , with its sweeping staircases and enormous rooms , was used for state events in the @entity160 epoch			0
there is still a distinct whiff of @entity165 villain ’s lair to its angular bulkiness			0
however , it would be wholly incorrect to say that @entity2 exists in some sepia yesteryear			0
and you do not have to look too closely to see a vibrant , modern city of quiet confidence			0
trundling along : a tram rolls past the @entity174 market hall - where you can find quality wines there are flashes of the now in the broad @entity179			0
@entity2 's main market hall may be a happy relic , dating to 1911 , but the picture inside is decidedly up to date – a host of stalls selling organic olive oils and fruity bottles of @entity34 's increasingly quaffable wines ; a small bar where locals discuss the issues of the day over discreet glasses of beer			1
this image blossoms on @entity194			0
@entity2 's key drag is largely pedestrianised , and when i amble along it in late afternoon , a merry crowd is in evidence – families milling around the shops , worker bees heading for the hive of bars and cafes			1
it is not quite the @entity206 , but it hints at something that @entity69 can not match			0
at the south end , the mountain which gives the avenue its name can be glimpsed between the townhouses – @entity214 , wearing a cap of snow			0
the ski season at its two resorts – @entity219 and @entity220 , both roughly half an hour away – usually runs between december and march			0
wandering further , i find myself in the leafy lanes to the rear of the @entity111 – where the ghosts of the communist decades are firmly exorcised by two splendid options for a night out			0
with a menu heavy on cocktails and high - end bottles of whisky , @entity227 is the sort of trendy watering hole that could comfortably exist in any great global metropolis , a wave of elegant conversation washing over the clientele within			0
another piece of the past and present : @entity2 's @entity10 is a doughty remnant of @entity51 times @entity241 15 , meanwhile , is one of the city 's undoubted culinary kingpins – a softly lit restaurant of crisp linen , gourmet flair and wine - list expertise			1
the menu entices with its talk of beef with herb - and - potato purée , and meatballs with pancetta			0
i choose the former , pairing it with a half - bottle of @entity34 merlot that is warm and rich – and wonder again why more people do not flit east to sample what is one of @entity45 's intriguing last secrets			1
for all the grand visibility of its past , @entity2 is a place that is increasingly facing forwards			0
@entity267 ( 0844 493 0787 ; www.ba.com ) flies to @entity2 daily from @entity268			0
return fares from £ 136			0
a three - night break at the five - star @entity2 costs from £ 495 per person ( based on two people sharing ) , including flights from @entity268 , private transfers and breakfast – through @entity276 ( 020 7873 5000 ; www.coxandkings.co.uk ) .			0

@entity34 's intriguing capital is one of @entity45 's less known major cities
it has historic buildings from the @entity51 , @entity284 and @entity20 eras
the *colossal* @entity287 is its most *significant* landmark
