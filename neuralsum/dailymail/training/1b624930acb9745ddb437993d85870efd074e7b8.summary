when mother - of - two @entity2 noticed a numb , tingling sensation in the fingers of her right hand , she never dreamed it could be something serious			1
' we 'd just got a puppy who was nipping a bit , and i assumed he 'd caught a nerve in my hand , ' says @entity2 , 41 , an interior designer from @entity15 , @entity16			1
' i forgot about it , but then , over the next three months , it got worse			2
my whole hand was numb			2
it was like i was wearing a thick ski glove			2
while driving , i did n't feel i could hold the steering wheel properly			0
' @entity2 's gp suspected carpal tunnel syndrome - when the nerve in the hand becomes compressed - but tests came back clear , so an mri scan was ordered			1
@entity2 had a tumour on her brain			1
she is here with husband @entity31 and children @entity33 , 8 ( l ) and @entity34 , 12 in the months before her scan appointment , her symptoms escalated			0
' the numbness had gone right down my leg by now and it felt like lead - i had to pull it up the stairs , ' says @entity2 , who is married to @entity43 , a deputy headteacher , and who has two daughters , @entity34 , now 12 , and @entity33 , eight , plus a stepson , @entity47 , 19			1
' but i still did n't think it was anything serious as i did n't have any other symptoms - no headaches or dizziness			1
' even after they did the @entity53 and called me back urgently for another one because they 'd found a “ spot ” on my brain , i remained calm			1
i do n't think i quite took it in			0
' the morning after her second mri scan , @entity2 received a phone call from the hospital			1
there was a tumour the size of a small aubergine on her brain			1
' @entity65 never occurred to me , ' she recalls today , four years later			0
' i was 36 , i had two young children and in the space of a few days my life had changed for ever			1
' medical advances in recent decades have transformed our knowledge of many cancers			0
but for brain tumours , which claim around 3,400 lives every year in @entity76 and @entity77 , we are badly lagging behind			1
@entity65 never occurred to her			0
she was just 36 the symptoms are vague and variable , and little is known about the causes or risk factors			1
worryingly , no one can fully explain why , unlike most other conditions , the number of cases is rising			0
' the detection rate is getting better , but even given that , there has been a jump in the numbers above what we might expect , ' says @entity92 , a neurosurgeon at @entity93 , @entity94			0
since 1970 , the incidence of brain cancer in the @entity97 has risen by 23 per cent in men and 25 per cent in women , according to the charity @entity100			1
there 's also been a rise in secondary brain tumours , which occur when cells from another cancer - such as a breast cancer - spread to the brain			1
between 20 and 40 per cent of cancers eventually spread to the brain - most commonly in patients who have had breast , lung , bowel and skin cancer			1
experts say not enough is being spent on research , meaning prognosis remains poor ; sadly , 58 per cent of people diagnosed with brain cancer die within a year , compared with 5 per cent for breast cancer and 7 per cent for prostate cancer			1
part of the problem is that brain tumours , by the nature of their location , are hard to reach			2
indeed , @entity2 's surgeon told her he would not know for sure what kind of tumour she had until he had begun operating on it			1
' he told me there were two possible types : one was non-recurring , the other terminal , ' she says			0
' my husband , @entity31 , and i dealt with it in very different ways			0
for me , it could only be the good type of tumour and there was no option of me not coming through this			2
' @entity31 felt he had to prepare himself for the worst outcome			0
' @entity2 's tumour was on her brain stem - the region at the back of the brain that connects it to the spinal cord			1
there was a high risk the operation itself would cause paralysis , but @entity2 had no choice			1
without treatment , she could have been dead within a year			0
' the three weeks before the operation in march 2009 were the worst of my life , ' she says			0
' we told the girls that @entity163 had an egg in her head and had to have it taken out			0
they were only three and seven at the time , but they 've since told me how frightened they were			0
' @entity170 surgeon predicted the operation would take four to five hours - it took nine			2
' it was a lot deeper and bigger than they 'd thought , so they had to cut through a lot of my nerve tissue , ' she says			0
' when i woke up , i was paralysed down one side			0
' in the following weeks and months , @entity2 fought to regain the use of her right - hand side , slowly learning to walk , talk and eat again			1
after one month , she went home to her family			0
tests showed that her tumour was a hemangioblastoma - a rare , but benign , type			1
one year after the operation , scans showed the tumour had n't returned			2
two years ago , she was told to go away and live her life as if it had never happened			0
' i was cured , and not many people with brain tumours can say that , ' she says			2
incredibly , she has suffered few long - term problems , apart from some numbness and weakness			2
' it 's mainly affected my small motor skills , so i ca n't sew a button on very quickly or hold two mugs with one hand , for example			0
and i ca n't wear court shoes , ballet pumps or anything without support because i ca n't flex my foot to keep the shoe on , ' she says			0
@entity2 's outcome is an astonishing one in a field of medicine that is notoriously complex			1
' what causes brain tumours is the $ 64,000 question , ' says neurosurgeon @entity92			2
' there is a relative peak in childhood and another in late middle age , but apart from that , we do n't know any absolute risk factors			0
' tests showed that her tumour was a hemangioblastoma - a rare , but benign , type espite fears that mobile phones cause brain tumours , the evidence does not suggest any link			1
there 's a risk of misdiagnosis because the condition is rare , and its symptoms - such as headache - are similar to many other , less serious illnesses			1
' a headache is very unlikely to be due to a brain tumour , but if it is persistent and unrelenting , alters when you change position , and is associated with nausea , visual disturbance , numbness and weakness , it 's worth having it checked			1
' brain tumours can not be treated with chemotherapy because of the blood - brain barrier - a natural protective blockade that stops drugs from getting into the brain from the bloodstream			1
surgery is often the first option , but this carries risks			0
' because of where they are , brain tumours are hard to remove without injuring the patient , ' says mr @entity92			2
' also peculiar to them is that they can be made up of different groups of cells which behave in different ways , making them difficult to see and take out			0
' so whatever treatment you apply , some tumour cells may be left behind			2
' but options are improving - we are starting to use 3d technology to create a picture of the tumour so that during surgery we can see which cells are tumour and which are normal brain			1
' certainly , experts hope that in the future we will hear more success stories such as @entity170			0
she says it took several months after her operation to start to make sense of what happened			0
' i suppose i used to think i was invincible			0
this made me realise we 're not in charge , ' she says			0
