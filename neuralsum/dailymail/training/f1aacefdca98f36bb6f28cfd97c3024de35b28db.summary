by @entity0 published : 02:05 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 03:45 est , 8 may 2013 paramedics were told they could not rush to the aid of a @entity5 staff member who appeared to be having a cardiac arrest in the newsroom because of strict rules designed to regulate on - screen behaviour , it has been reported			1
when the paramedics reached the newsroom at @entity13 in @entity14 after a 999 call about a worker who was believed to be seriously ill , it is claimed that security denied them access because they would have been seen by viewers in the large open plan space , forcing the stricken journalist to make his way to them			1
the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) has now made a complaint to senior @entity5 management about the incident			1
insiders at the @entity5 say paramedics were prevented from reaching a seriously ill journalist in the newsroom by strict on - screen rules @entity30 , of the @entity23 , said : ' the member of staff had to struggle out of camera shot to get to the paramedic as the crew were nâ€™t allowed to walk across the newsroom to them because of their high - vis jackets			1
' this can not be allowed to happen again			0
a more sensible solution has to be found , such as putting screens up			0
fortunately on this occasion the person in question was not critically ill , but the @entity5 can not let petty rules potentially put lives in danger			2
' a spokesman for the @entity5 denied that emergency services were hindered and insisted the patient walked to reception			1
he said there was ' no ban on medical staff attending to patients in the newsroom '			0
there are reported to be wider concerns among @entity5 staff about strict guidelines over their behaviour in the newsroom			1
rumblings : there are also reports that @entity5 workers are unhappy with strict instructions dictating how they should behave when it opened in march , the 3,000 journalists who work there were issued with a list of guidelines , including avoiding large gatherings , clearing away coats and avoiding bright or garish items of clothing			2
they were also given maps of the newsroom floor , showing them where to walk to avoid being caught on camera			0
the @entity5 spokesman told the @entity77 that guidance ' was issued to staff working in the transmission area ahead of the first live broadcast ' , adding that wearing high - visibility clothing , congregating directly behind the live shot or eating at desks was discouraged , but not banned			2
insiders quoted by the paper also claim that staff have been tasked with monitoring what appears on screen and issuing instructions to colleagues , including ' stop yawning ' and ' put that sandwich down '			0
one @entity5 member of staff said : ' there are signs everywhere warning staff they could be on camera			0
' some people find it an intrusion , particularly the older hands , but for anyone in their 20s starting out in broadcast journalism its just the reality of life			0

it is alleged security staff would not let paramedics into newsroom
broadcaster has strict rules concerning what viewers can see
@entity23 complains but @entity5 has denied the paramedics were hindered
