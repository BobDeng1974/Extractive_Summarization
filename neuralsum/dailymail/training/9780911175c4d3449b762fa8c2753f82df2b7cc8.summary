by @entity0 they may not look it , but these twins are a real pair of fighters - having survived months of chemotherapy while in the womb			2
their mother @entity8 was 16 weeks pregnant when doctors broke the terrible news that she had breast cancer			1
the only chance of saving her life was aggressive chemotherapy , but she was terrified that the unborn twins would not survive			0
against the odds , however , they did - and were born healthy			1
experts say they have never known of a mother having chemotherapy while pregnant with twins before			2
so lucky : cancer survivor @entity8 says @entity22 and @entity23 , now 18 months old , are full of life not only that , but she also had radiotherapy and a mastectomy			1
miss @entity8 , 40 , a cashier , had been desperate for a family with her partner @entity28 , 27 , an assistant retail manager , and the couple had saved up £ 4,200 for @entity31 treatment			1
she said : ' i 'd had an ectopic pregnancy ten years previously and doctors had to remove my fallopian tubes , so @entity31 was my only chance of becoming pregnant			2
' two weeks after the treatment , she discovered she was pregnant and a fortnight later a scan showed there were two heartbeats			1
she said : ' we were absolutely thrilled			0
' but at 16 weeks pregnant she discovered a lump in her breast while in the shower , and a week later doctors delivered the devastating news that it was breast cancer			1
pregnant : @entity8 underwent chemo , radiotherapy and a mastectomy before the birth miss @entity8 said : ' it was devastating			1
i could n't stop crying			0
' i was so worried about the babies			0
the doctors told me i had to have a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy – all while i was still pregnant			1
' all i could think of was how could they possibly survive through all that			0
' miss @entity8 had a mastectomy the following week , when she was 18 weeks pregnant			1
two weeks later she started chemotherapy , losing all her hair - causing her to wear a wig - and suffering from exhaustion			2
' luckily tests on my lymph nodes showed the cancer had n't spread , which was such a relief , ' she said			2
' i was so worried about the chemotherapy damaging the babies , but scans every week showed they had kept on growing			0
each week it was such a relief to still see them there			0
' miss @entity8 then had a month 's course of radiotherapy , which finished when she was 30 weeks pregnant			1
five weeks later , in november 2012 , the babies were born by emergency caesarean at @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity23 weighing 5lb 1oz and her twin @entity22 weighing 4lb 13oz			1
miss @entity8 said : ' it was the most amazing moment when i finally held them in my arms after everything that had happened			2
' they were two little fighters - to have gone through all that in the womb			2
' straight after the twins ' birth their mother had to have another course of chemotherapy , which finished three months later			0
' it was a much stronger treatment and i felt so exhausted , but every time i held @entity23 and @entity22 in my arms , i knew that i was doing it for them , ' she said			0
' i was determined to see my babies grow up and if it meant going through this , then i would do it			0
' she has just finished a 12 - month course of the breast cancer drug herceptin and doctors have told her the cancer is in remission			1
she will have to take another drug , @entity106 , for the next five years to stop it returning			0
she said : ' i feel so lucky that i 'm still here and my babies are both here safe and sound			0
' they are 18 months old now and are full of life			0
i feel like the luckiest mum in the world			0
' a spokesman for leading breast cancer charity @entity115 said : ' we are not aware of such a case before , where a woman has been pregnant with twins while having treatment			1

@entity8 was 16 weeks pregnant when told she had breast cancer
she underwent chemo , radiotherapy and a mastectomy before the birth
but the two ' little fighters ' were born healthy and her cancer is in remission
