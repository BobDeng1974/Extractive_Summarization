@entity1 co-chairman @entity0 is dreaming of being paired with @entity2 after his @entity3 dumped @entity4 out of the @entity5 on a day of shocks on saturday			1
@entity1 fought back from 2 - 0 down at @entity7 to claim the biggest upset of the day , if not the entire tournament - no mean feat considering @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 also lost to supposedly inferior opposition on saturday - and their 4 - 2 victory earned the @entity17 side a place in the fifth round			1
the @entity3 have a recent history of giant - killing - beating @entity21 and @entity22 to reach the 2013 @entity27 final - and , after ending the @entity25 leaders ' interest in this season 's @entity5 , @entity0 hopes to be pitted against @entity29 's @entity28 when the fifth - round draw is made on monday evening			1
@entity1 's players celebrate in front of their travelling fans after the full - time whistle at @entity7 @entity1 co-chairman @entity0 is dreaming of a fifth round @entity5 tie against @entity2 @entity2 , of course , are not guaranteed a place in the next round after they were held to a goalless draw at @entity40 on friday , but @entity41 has his hopes pinned on an @entity44 tie			1
' my wife 's a big @entity2 fan , so hopefully ( we get ) @entity2 away , ' he told @entity48			2
@entity1 's victory over @entity51 's expensively assembled team is likely to live long in their fans ' memory , and @entity41 does not believe scalps come any bigger			2
' it 's like ( beating ) @entity56 , for me , ' he said			0
' it 's like winning at a top , top @entity59 side			0
that 's what @entity4 are - @entity4 are a top , top @entity59 side			2
@entity4 's players are left dejected after @entity1 staged a stunning comeback on saturday ' i do n't think there 's one single @entity1 fan that would turn around and say , ' i think it ( their cup run ) is a distraction '			1
' @entity4 has made our season			2
' @entity0 's wish for a fifth - round encounter against 11 - time winners @entity2 was echoed by the man who masterminded saturday 's extraordinary triumph			1
@entity79 ( right ) rifled in a sturnning strike for @entity1 to make it 2 - 1 and give the visitors some hope @entity1 manager @entity84 could be excused for wanting the easiest tie possible , but he too hopes to take on the likes of @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
' if i had my choice , i 'd like to play @entity2 , ' he said			2
' the experience we had ( on saturday ) , going to @entity7 was just terrific			0
if @entity2 can manage to beat @entity40 , it would be great to go to @entity44			0
@entity95 ( right ) celebrates making it 2 - 2 as @entity97 and @entity98 look on helplessly ' but , whoever we get , it 's great to be in the fifth round			1
we 're enjoying being in the limelight			0
' @entity84 oversaw the @entity27 victories over @entity21 and @entity22 , but believes the @entity4 win was his best yet - even if @entity51 made several changes to his side			1
' the night we beat @entity21 they played a full - strength team , but it was a night set up for a cup shock with a pitch starting to get a little bit frosty , ' he said			2
' it was a freezing cold night in @entity1 , with all the elements for a cup shock			0
@entity114 calmly slots home to make it 3 - 2 and cap a remarkable comeback for @entity1 ' going down there to @entity7 , with a fantastic playing surface and 40,000 people behind them , to beat the league leaders and one of the best teams in @entity125 has to top the @entity21 victory			1
' @entity4 took a 2 - 0 lead through @entity128 and @entity129 , but @entity79 pulled a goal back before half - time before goals from @entity133 , @entity114 and @entity134 completed the upset			1
' it 's really just about giving the lads the belief to go out there and put on their best performance , ' @entity84 added			0
@entity134 beats the @entity4 defence and slots home past @entity98 to make it 4 - 2 to @entity1 ' we respected @entity4 , but we certainly did n't fear them			1
we were n't going to back off them and give them the ball in our half			0
when they came into the middle third we pressed them aggressively and that was the key			0
' we did n't give them any time on the ball and they 're not used to that at that level			0
when we had the ball ourselves we played with real calmness and i 'm really pleased because it 's so important			0
these days do n't come along very often and when they do it 's great we made the most of it			0
the lads really did themselves credit			0
