@entity0 , left , and @entity1 have complained to police about online rape threats to their daughter , @entity5 , right @entity0 and @entity1 released a statement today , above , saying @entity30 had launched an investigation twitter trolls turned on @entity5 after her mother appeared to defend rapist @entity12 , right , on loose women today @entity5 's parents put a statement on their website saying : ' following legal advice , our family has now made a formal complaint to the @entity41 about cyber-stalking , harassment and , most recently , rape threats made against @entity5 on @entity18			1
' we have presented the police with a substantial amount of evidence , and they have launched an immediate investigation			1
' we will be making no further comment at this time			0
' the furore began when @entity1 , 66 , appeared on @entity51 's @entity33 shortly before @entity12 was released from jail a week ago after serving two and a half years for raping a 19 - year - old woman			1
@entity1 argued that the 26 - year - old should be allowed to resume his playing career on his release from jail because , while the attack was ' unpleasant ' , his victim was drunk			1
she also said : ' the rape – and i am not , please , by any means minimising any kind of rape – but the rape was not violent			2
he did n’t cause any bodily harm to the person			0
' under the @entity69 1988 , any ' indecent or grossly offensive ' message that causes ' distress or anxiety ' to the recipient can lead to prosecution			0
the maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £ 2,500			2
since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet , e-mail and social networking , prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge @entity18 trolls			1
student @entity89 , who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer @entity92 collapsed , was charged under the @entity93			2
two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the @entity96 , and @entity97 , who joked he would blow @entity99 airport ' sky high ' was charged under the @entity101			2
earlier this month , justice secretary @entity102 revealed to @entity103 that the maximum six month sentence for internet abuse will be quadrupled the tougher new legislation is already being dubbed ‘ @entity107 ’ after miss @entity109 's public stance against the disturbing messages			2
her comments provoked a storm on social media sites , with campaigners accusing her of perpetuating harmful myths about rape			2
@entity1 apologised several times for causing offence , insisting that rape was ' an appalling crime ' , and saying she was merely discussing ' the legal facts of the case '			1
but the trolls merely turned on her daughter , with one saying : ' @entity1 's given me her blessing to rape you			1
' another tweet , directed at her mother , said : ' hope you discover first hand what rape is like you idiot			2
' in a message put up via @entity18 , @entity5 said : ' my mother was voicing an opinion on the matter of criminals being accepted back into society			1
' the comments she made on the case in question were facts , so not opinions			0
' while it may anger some that the term " non-violent rape " exists , unfortunately it does			0
' referencing it and explaining why that was the charge does not mean that you think this category of rape is acceptable			0
' to believe that my mother is pro " non-violent rape " is ridiculous and i am shocked that many people have jumped to this conclusion			0
' to the trolls wishing rape on me , stop , you are utterly pathetic			1
' at the time , @entity0 used @entity18 to warn the trolls he would go to police , saying : '' i have noted every sick troll threat			1
' do they really think it 's ok to wish / threaten rape on a woman ? they 're in deep trouble , trust me			2
' he added : ' trolls who sent sick rape threats ? @entity174 awaits you			1
' a @entity30 spokesman said today : ' an allegation of harassment was made to @entity180 police relating to messages received via a social media site			2
targeted : @entity184 mp , left , and historian @entity185 , right , have both been victims of online trolling ' a criminal investigation has commenced			0
there are no arrests at this stage but enquiries continue			0
' last month @entity193 , a 33 - year - old delivery driver from @entity194 , was jailed for 18 weeks for using @entity18 to threaten to rape @entity196 mp @entity184 in response to her backing of a campaign to put @entity201 on the £ 10 note			1
historian @entity185 was trolled after she appeared on television , with one troll , @entity206 student @entity205 , 20 , calling her a ' filthy old slut '			0
she later accepted his invitation to lunch to apologise , and said afterwards : ' he is going to find it hard to get a job , because as soon as you @entity215 his name , that is what comes up			0
' rape in @entity219 is an offence under the @entity221 , which came into force a decade ago , replacing and refining previous legislation			0
one of the key changes under the new act was to define consent			0
a person consents if they agree to have sex by choice , and if they have the freedom and capacity to make that choice			0
therefore in a situation where a victim had sex when they were incapacitated by drink , the law would say that they did not have the freedom or capacity to make the choice , ie did not consent			0
the law does not require the victim to have physically resisted in order to prove a lack of consent			0
