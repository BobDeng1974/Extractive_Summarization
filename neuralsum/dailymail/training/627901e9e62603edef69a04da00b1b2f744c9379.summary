by @entity0 published : 15:25 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 15:39 est , 29 july 2013 former @entity1 and current @entity3 schools chief @entity2 and his staff raised a charter school 's grades despite poor test scores			1
@entity2 and his staff gave the school run by a prominent @entity12 donor an @entity13 , after test scores in algebra initially earned it a ' c ' , emails obtained by @entity0 showed			1
the schools chief is renowned for promising to hold ' failing ' schools accountable			0
fixing grades ? former @entity1 and current @entity3 schools chief @entity2 ( pictured ) is accused of fixing school grades at a charter school run by a prominent @entity12 donor but when it appeared the @entity26 charter school run by @entity27 might receive a poor grade , @entity2 's education team frantically overhauled his signature ' @entity31 ' school grading system to improve the school 's marks			1
' they need to understand that anything less than an a for @entity37 compromises all of our accountability work , ' @entity2 wrote in a sept. 12 email to then - chief of staff @entity41 , who is now gov. @entity43 's chief lobbyist			1
the emails , which also show @entity2 discussed with staff the legality of changing just @entity27 's grade , raise unsettling questions about the validity of a grading system that has broad implications			1
@entity1 uses the a-f grades to determine which schools get taken over by the state and whether students seeking state - funded vouchers to attend private school need to first spend a year in public school			1
@entity27 has given more than $ 2.8 million to @entity12 since 1998 , including $ 130,000 to @entity2 they also help determine how much state funding schools receive			1
a low grade also can detract from a neighborhood and drive homebuyers elsewhere			1
@entity2 , who now is reworking @entity3 's grading system as that state 's education commissioner , reviewed the emails monday morning and denied that @entity27 's school received special treatment			1
he said discovering that the charter would receive a low grade raised broader concerns with grades for other ' combined ' schools - those that included multiple grade levels - across the state			1
' there was not a secret about this , ' he said			0
' this was n't just to give @entity37 an @entity82 it was to make sure the system was right to make sure the system was face valid			0
' however , the emails clearly show @entity2 's staff was intensely focused on @entity37 , whose founder has given more than $ 2.8 million to @entity12 since 1998 , including $ 130,000 to @entity2 and thousands more to state legislative leaders			1
other schools saw their grades change , but the emails show @entity27 's charter was the catalyst for any changes			1
@entity2 rocketed to prominence with the help of former @entity1 gov. @entity97 , former @entity3 gov. @entity98 and a national network of @entity12 leaders and donors , such as @entity102			2
@entity2 is a co-founder of @entity98 's @entity103 , a group consisting mostly of @entity12 state school superintendents pushing school vouchers , teacher merit pay and many other policies enacted by @entity2 in @entity1			1
though @entity1 had had a school ranking system since 1999 , @entity2 switched to the @entity31 system and made it a signature item of his education agenda , raising the stakes for schools statewide			2
@entity2 consistently cited @entity37 as a top - performing school as he secured support for the measure from business groups and lawmakers , including house speaker @entity120 and @entity123 president @entity122 @entity121			2
but trouble loomed when @entity1 's then - grading director , @entity125 , first alerted @entity2 on sept. 12 that the @entity126 had scored less than an @entity82 @entity126 ( pictured ) in @entity26 is run by @entity12 donor @entity27 ' this will be a huge problem for us , ' @entity2 wrote in a sept. 12 , 2012 email to @entity131			1
@entity131 fired back a few minutes later , ' oh , crap			0
we can not release until this is resolved			0
' by sept. 13 , @entity125 unveiled it was a 2.9 , or a ' c '			0
a week - long behind - the - scenes scramble ensued among @entity2 , assistant superintendent @entity136 , @entity125 , @entity131 and other top staff at the @entity138			2
they examined ways to lift @entity37 from a ' c ' to an @entity13 , including adjusting the presentation of color charts to make a high ' b ' look like an @entity13 and changing the grade just for @entity37			2
it 's not clear from the emails exactly how @entity125 changed the grading formula , but they do show @entity102 's grade jumping twice			1
' that 's like parting the @entity155 to get numbers to move that significantly , ' @entity151 , superintendent of @entity153 schools in @entity26 , said in an interview with the @entity0			2
@entity27 , who opened the @entity126 charter school in @entity26 in 2002 and has since opened schools in @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , said in a statement monday that no one from the school ever made any requests that would affect @entity37 's grades			1
current @entity1 schools chief @entity170 's office declined comment on the emails			2
@entity170 , a @entity173 , defeated @entity2 in november with a grass - roots campaign driven by teachers angered by @entity2 's education agenda			2
@entity2 said monday he felt no special pressure to deliver an " a " for @entity27			2
instead , he argued , if he had paid more attention to politics he would have won re-election in @entity1			0
yet @entity2 wrote to staff twice in four days , directly inquiring about @entity27 's status			1
@entity125 broke the news after the second note that ' terrible ' 10th grade algebra results had ' dragged down their entire school			0
' @entity2 called the situation ' very frustrating and disappointing ' in an email that day			0
' i am more than a little miffed about this , ' @entity2 wrote			0
' i hope we come to the meeting today with solutions and not excuses and / or explanations for me to wiggle myself out of the repeated lies i have told over the past six months			0
' @entity2 said monday that email expressed his frustration at having assured top - performing schools like @entity27 's would be recognized in the grading system , but coming away with a flawed formula that would undo his promises			1
when requested a status update sept. 14 , his staff alerted him that the new school grade , a 3.50 , was painfully close to an @entity13			0
then - deputy chief of staff @entity208 wrote that the state might not be able to ' legally ' change the cutoff for an @entity13			0
' we can revise the rule , ' @entity2 responded			0
over the next week , his top staff worked arduously to get @entity214			0
by sept. 21 , @entity37 had jumped to a 3.75			0
the emails do n't detail what @entity125 changed in the school formula or how many schools were affected			0
@entity1 education experts consulted for this article said they were n't aware the formula had been changed .			0

emails showed @entity2 discussing with staff the legality of changing just @entity27 's grade
@entity27 has given more than $ 2.8 million to @entity12 since 1998 , including $ 130,000 to @entity2
grades determine how much state funding schools receive
low grade also detract from a neighborhood and drive homebuyers elsewhere
