junior was ' a kind , ambitious , humble , reliable , caring , friendly boy ' his mother said a girl of 14 who ordered a teenager to be stabbed for being ‘ disrespectful ’ was found guilty of manslaughter yesterday			1

both were cleared of murder by a jury at the @entity17 yesterday , but they are facing long prison terms after being found guilty of manslaughter			1
@entity0 ’s mother , @entity20 , collapsed in tears after the verdicts and had to be comforted by friends and relatives			2
she said afterwards : ‘ all he wanted to do was play football with his friends and be left alone			2
he certainly did n’t deserve to have his young , innocent life taken away			2
’ the court heard how @entity0 lost his life following a ‘ trivial ’ argument as he played football with friends on a patch of grass near his home in @entity37 , @entity38			2
the girl claimed @entity0 had insulted her during the row , which broke out after she walked across the middle of the pitch with her friends			1
she then called her boyfriend , who is now 17 , and ordered him to ‘ teach @entity0 a lesson ’ , the court was told			1
witnesses said they heard the girl boasting that she had arranged for someone to stab the teenager and she later went home to fetch a kitchen knife			1
when her boyfriend arrived on the scene , he was handed the blade and used it to stab @entity0 once , piercing his heart and lung			1
the youngster collapsed yards from his housing estate home in september last year and was pronounced dead an hour later			1
prosecutor @entity64 said the argument ‘ was stupid and trivial and completely unnecessary ’			2
‘ it was loud enough to be heard by neighbours , ’ he added			0

‘ she called up her boyfriend and was heard to tell @entity0 that she had arranged for somebody to come and stab him			1
’ the girl had been angry and determined that @entity0 should be punished to put things right , the @entity17 heard mr @entity77 added : ‘ he ( the defendant ) was encouraged and requested by her to come and do this			1
indeed , to use an old - fashioned phrase , was set up by her to do this			0
’ the 17 - year - old killer , from @entity84 , @entity38 , claimed he was acting as a peacemaker and knifed @entity0 in self - defence			0
both he and the girl , from @entity37 , were given anonymity during the trial			1
judge @entity90 will decide whether to reveal their identities when they are sentenced on april 5			0
mrs @entity20 said she is still haunted by visions of her dying son			0
she added : ‘ it makes me feel so angry			0
it happened so quickly and so close to our home			0
‘ i did n’t even know what was going on and i had no chance to help , or see him and say goodbye and tell him how much i love him because by the time i got to him my poor child had bled to death			0
' i wake every day and see where my boy was killed , the vision of him lying on the floor wounded , breathless , motionless , and bleeding as the paramedics tried to save him , a horrific vision that is engraved in my mind			0
‘ there have been many days i ca n’t face even going outside as the reminder of what has happened is too painful			2
‘ i always thought my boys would have to bury me one day , not this way around			0
’ detective chief inspector @entity120 , of the @entity121 , said : ‘ the death of @entity7 illustrates the terrible consequences of what appears to be the casual acceptance that knives have a part to play in minor disputes between young people in some parts of our community			1
