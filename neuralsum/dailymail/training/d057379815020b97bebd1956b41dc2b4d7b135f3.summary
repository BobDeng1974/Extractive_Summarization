@entity0 has won legal damages against a @entity3 author whose novel features a promiscuous character based on the @entity7 actress			1
lawyers working for @entity0 , 29 , told a court in @entity10 that writer @entity11 had invented a series of love affairs with other celebrities amounting to a ' fraudulent use of her personal rights '			1
@entity11 had argued that the @entity0 character in his book ' the first thing we look at ' was in fact meant as a ' tribute ' to her beauty			1
upset : lawyers working for @entity7 star @entity0 claimed a novel features a promiscuous character based on her amounted to a ' fraudulent use of her personal rights ' claims : author @entity11 ( left ) argued that the @entity0 character in his book ' the first thing we look at ' ( right ) was in fact meant as a ' tribute ' to her beauty @entity0 's lawyer @entity38 told the court @entity11 's book presented her as a ' sex object ' and that a series of love affairs detailed in the work never took place			1
the book 's offending scene comes when a mysterious blonde woman that the author describes as @entity0 's ' exact double ' asks for help at the house of a car mechanic in a @entity3 village			1
the mechanic is described as looking like ' a better version of @entity57 '			0
@entity11 said he never meant the scene to offend , adding : ' it was meant as the highest praise			2
she is an archetypal beauty of our times , very human with a touching fragility			0
' she is a wonderful , iconic actress			0
i was hoping that she might send me flowers because this book is , in a way , a declaration of love , ' he went on to say			0
big name : @entity11 said his work is meant to be a satire on celebrity culture , but would think twice about referring to @entity0 ( pictured here being honoured with a star on the @entity78 ) in future characters in the book are also based on actors @entity83 ( left ) and @entity57 ( right )			1
the mechanic that @entity0 's character is romantically linked with is described as ' a better version of @entity57 ' @entity11 said his work is meant to be a satire on celebrity culture , but would think twice about referring to @entity89 in future			1
' if i had known she was going to kick up such a racket , i would have picked another actress			0
' all these famous people live with us all the time			0
celebrity culture is imposed on us by the media , the press and the @entity100 , ' @entity11 added			2
' so her complaint is based on exactly the phenomenon i am denouncing			0
but i suppose it 's all very @entity107 , ' he went on to say			0
as part of her legal action , @entity0 sought an injunction to stop the novel being translated or adapted for cinema			2
that particular request was thrown out by the @entity10 court			0
she had also demanded £ 40,000 in damages for the ' fraudulent use of her personal rights ' but that figure was significantly reduced to just £ 2,000 by the judge			1
speaking after the verdict , @entity11 described the sum he had been ordered to pay ' derisory ' .			2

lawyers working for @entity7 star , 29 , claimed book invented love affairs
character based on @entity0 was used *purely* as a sex object , she said
but @entity3 author @entity11 argued character was a tribute
he said ' the first thing we look at ' was never intended to offend the star
judge ordered author to pay @entity0 £ 2,000 in damages for the ordeal
but he dismissed request for an injunction *banning* book being translated
the celebrity satire also mentions actors @entity83 and @entity57
