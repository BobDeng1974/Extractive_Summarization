the internet has revolutionised the way we communicate and a third of the world ’s population use it to stay connected			1
now , @entity8 - based internet cartographer and computer scientist @entity6 has used software to ‘ ping ’ all of these global web devices and create a map demonstrating the technology ’s global reach			1
in the majority of cases , this signal was sent to routers rather than individual gadgets , but mr @entity6 said @entity20 and @entity22 devices have appeared previously			1
connected : @entity8 - based internet cartographer and computer scientist @entity6 has used software to ‘ ping ’ global web devices to build a map ( pictured ) demonstrating the technology ’s global reach the cartographer said it took around five hours to ping all ip addresses on august 2			1
the map then took more than 12 hours to create			0
' pinging ' an ip address involves sending a signal to the device from a server , which causes the connection to ' light up ' - albeit not physically			2
mr @entity6 is founder of @entity39 , a search engine for connected devices			1
different colours represent the density of devices in that region , and unsurprisingly , the world ’s largest cities in developed countries glow the brightest			0
red areas contain a lot of web - enabled devices , while green areas contain fewer			1
black areas are regions where no signal was received			1
while it may be no surprise that there seem to be less internet - connected devices in parts of @entity60 , mr @entity6 explained his map is not precise because some organisations block ping requests			1
it is thought that areas of @entity66 should be coloured bright red on the map , but the country ’s ‘ @entity71 ’ explains why most of the country looks dark			1
the cartographer said it took five hours to ' ping ' all ip addresses on 2 august			0
the map then took more than 12 hours to create			0
red areas contain a lot of web - enabled devices , while black areas contain the fewest			1
it is easy to see how well - connected areas like @entity84 and the @entity85 ( pictured ) contrast with @entity87 and @entity60 internet blackout : it is thought that areas of @entity66 should be coloured bright red on the map , but the country ’s ‘ @entity71 ’ explains why most of the country looks dark ( pictured )			1
‘ there 's basically not a lot of information available on where an ip address is located within @entity66 , which makes mapping it very difficult			1
the majority of devices simply get lumped into @entity102 or @entity103 , even though they might be located somewhere else within the country , ’ he wrote			0
explaining how he made the map , mr @entity6 said : ‘ the data was generated using a stateless scanner used to create @entity39 ( a computer search engine that he founded )			2
‘ a free , open - source scanner called @entity112 is readily available for anybody that wants to do it themselves , and the map itself was generated using the @entity120 matplotlib library			2
in the last year , it has become easy to scan the whole internet using such tools , where an individual sends and receives packets to everyone connected to the internet , @entity121 reported			2
mr @entity6 essentially asked computers , smartphones , tablets and games consoles to send him their location so he could create his map			0
to do this , he used a database that pinpoints a city for each ip address and used another tool to find them easily on a map of the world			0
a firm called @entity143 recently created a map of internet freedom around the world ( pictured ) based on a @entity148 report in 2013			2
regions marked in white have the freedom to roam , as opposed to those marked red the internet has revolutionised communication and promotes free speech across the globe			2
consequently , online freedom is a hot topic			0
some governments consider the internet to be dangerous and inflammatory so they regulate it			0
a firm called @entity143 recently created a map of internet freedom around the world based on a @entity148 report in 2013			2
in the report , countries were reviewed on limits placed on online content , obstacles to internet access , and violations of user rights			0
they were then graded as free , partly free or not free and marked on a map in white , pink and red respectively			0
countries marked in grey were not included in the report			0
@entity66 , @entity180 and @entity181 were found to be the top three user rights violators when it comes to online freedom .			0

@entity8 - based cartographer used software to ‘ ping ’ global web devices
using this data he drew a map demonstrating the internet 's global reach
signal was sent to routers rather than individual devices
red areas show parts of the world with the most connected devices , while black areas show regions where few *people* have access to the internet
@entity211 is *n't* complete because of *censorship* and *security* *restrictions*
it 's thought @entity66 , for example , has more internet connected devices than shown on the map
