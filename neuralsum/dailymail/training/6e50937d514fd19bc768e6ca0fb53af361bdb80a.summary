he told the court : ' the prosecution case is that each of the 57 loads contained somewhere between 23 and 107 kilos of cocaine			2
' it 's at the very highest level of drug importation into this country			0
the scope of this conspiracy stretches far beyond the two loads that were recovered			0
' judge @entity29 went further , saying : ' this really is the top end of the scale is it not ? when you are in the order of six tonnes , and high purity at that ? ' it was in my opinion a relatively simple but audacious way of getting class a drugs into the @entity28			2
' whilst it is n't possible for the prosecution to determine precisely the weight of cocaine you imported it was obviously a vast amount , at least between 1,300kg and 6,000kg , worth many , many millions of pounds			0
' also this was high purity cocaine that no doubt would have been cut up for street dealing			0
' this case highlights the ease with which vast amounts of cocaine can be imported into this country			0
