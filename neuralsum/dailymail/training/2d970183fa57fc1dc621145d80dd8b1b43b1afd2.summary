@entity1 , 27 , is a now a social worker in @entity10 and said she was ' groomed ' by @entity2 , then in his 70s , who laughed as he groped her			1
as well as touching her all over her body , on one occasion the paedophile pushed her up against a wall and forced kisses on her			1
ms @entity1 broke her silence as the @entity19 revealed there are at least 300 victims who were attacked by the @entity22 police also raided @entity2 ’s secluded @entity25 holiday home as they pursued more than 400 lines of inquiry			1
ms @entity1 said her abuse lasted six months while she worked at @entity29 and @entity30 in @entity31 , where @entity2 lived in @entity5			1
she told how @entity2 dubbed her his ' private waitress ' at the restaurant , one of his favourite haunts			1
' he followed me into a back changing room where the waitresses took a break and pretended he had gone the wrong way , ' she said			2
' he said " oops , but while i ’m in here , " and pushed me up against the wall and tried to kiss me and was laughing at me			1
' it was really awful as he found it so funny			2
i managed to turn my cheek to him nstead of my lips and wriggled out of his grip and ran away			2
allegation : @entity22 @entity2 at his house in @entity5 - from where he would go for fish and chips at a local restaurant where ms @entity1 worked as a teenager difficult : @entity1 struggled for years to cope with what happened but is now a social worker in child protection as well as a married mother of one ' he even asked me to go back to his flat			1
everyone could hear and he said it like he was pretending , but he meant it			2
hope : @entity1 says that she has explained what happened to encourage more people to come forward and speak to police like she has ' i recall he said " do you want to come back to my place in @entity70 and be my private waitress ? ' i never did , thankfully , but who knows what might have happened			2
now i have heard about the rape allegations and other assaults , i know it could have been much worse			0
' i feel angry now as i blamed myself			0
i did not realise i was being exploited			0
everyone thought he was wonderful			0
' now married and mother to a five - year - old girl , @entity1 was brought up in @entity31 and enjoyed her work in the restaurant when predator @entity2 was n’t visiting			1
she said : “ it all happened during 1998 - 99 when i was still at school and worked part - time as a waitress			2
@entity2 would come in at tea - time for a meal and we all used to laugh because we thought he was a bit odd			1
' he would flirt with the waitresses but seemed to make a fuss of me and always did things like drop cutlery on the floor and ask me to pick it up			0
' he would also leave me massive tips			0
it was great if you smiled and were nice to him			0
but one time he really groped my bottom , not just a brush it was awful			1
' later i told my mum and she was livid			0
she wanted to go to the police but i would n’t			0
eventually i just left my job			0
' i always hated seeing his picture after what happened			0
but if speaking out helps other people to come forward , if they are being abused , then i am happy to talk about it			0

@entity1 was 14 at the time and @entity2 was in his 70s
the mother of one claims he pushed her against a wall and tried to kiss her
' he really groped my bottom , not just a brush , it was awful , ' she said
