but having recruited both her and several other female personalities to front campaigns for their most famous scent , @entity15 , @entity10 fashion house @entity9 is set to mix things up			1
for the first time in its 91 year history , the perfume is being endorsed by a male celebrity			1
and @entity21 , 46 , has been chosen as the man for the task - though we 're pretty sure the reported $ 7m ( £ 4.32m ) paycheck will have sweetened the job			1
to get us all in the mood ( and rather hot under the no.5 - scented collar ) , the luxury brand have released a selection of campaign teaser shots of the advertising campaign , due to hit the glossies in full in the november issues			2
@entity9 have also released a number of mini videos - a maximum of just eight seconds each featuring father - of - six mr @entity38			2
director @entity39 - whose previous works include two @entity42 movies @entity43 and @entity44 - shot the full commercial , which premieres in full on 15 october			2
@entity39 was also behind the recent cinematic @entity47 commercial featuring @entity42 haring around @entity48 on a motorbike			2
in one sneak preview black - and - white photographs for the new campaign , artist @entity50 has captured the actor and director in a contemplative , mid-shoot mood			1
director 's cut : @entity21 , left , and @entity1 advert director @entity39 , right , during shooting of the commercial and although we do n't get to see @entity21 in action in the teaser video , we do get a rather mysterious recording of his whispery voice , asking ' do you feel lucky ? why ? '			0
the vocal snippet is set against a still of @entity21 's shirted upper back and the back of his head , an image topped with the @entity73 logo and split with the printed phrase ' do you feel lucky ? '			0
in another video the @entity78 star asks ' what ’s the mystery ? ' , ' are you going somewhere ? ' , then ' where ? '			0
it was revealed back in may that @entity78 star was going to front @entity9 's new campaign , and @entity86 , a spokesman for @entity9 , said : ' to keep a legend fresh , you always have to change its point of view			0
it is the first time we 've had a man speaking about a women 's fragrance			0
' we think very much that the perfume is a seduction between a man , a woman and the perfume			0
@entity15 is our leading fragrance , and we are willing to make the investment to keep it on that level			0
' the actor follows in the footsteps of actresses including @entity3 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			1
let 's hear it for the girls : @entity105 became the face of @entity9 in 2003 , left , and a billboard poster for the scent , right			1

the actor was reportedly paid $ 7m ( £ 4.32m ) for his *services*
