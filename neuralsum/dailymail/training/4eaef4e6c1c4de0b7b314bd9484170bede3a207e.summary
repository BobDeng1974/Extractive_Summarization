two - thirds of @entity2 fathers would think twice before approaching a child in distress in public over fears they would be labelled a predator , new research shows			1
the survey conducted to coincide with the launch of @entity11 , a gps tracking device for children , found that 45 percent of fathers said they would be reluctant to help a child , unless the child was in great distress and action was needed			1
and 23 percent of dads would not help lost children under any circumstance			1
parenting researcher dr @entity21 said this reaction was common			0
@entity11 inventor @entity23 ( pictured ) , who was abducted as a six year old , said he was inspired to create the device after he lost his daughter @entity25 ( pictured ) at the beach when she was two @entity27 ( pictured ) is carried on the child and links to the @entity11 app , which can be downloaded to any @entity32 or @entity34 @entity33 provides distance and direction information for users to quickly locate their child , and it alerts the user if a child moves outside of their designated boundary ' a lot of men i 've spoken to in parenting groups , in conversation and in counselling have told me they do prefer to stay away from other children because they 're worried about what they 'd be accused of , ' dr @entity21 said			1
' they 're recognising that men are by far and away statically more likely to be abusers			0
' and they 're recognising they would prefer to avoid any situation that would compromise people 's perceptions of their integrity			2
' dr @entity62 , vice chair of the board of the @entity64 , said child molesters had become ' the 21st century bogeyman '			2
the launch of the device coincides with a survey that has found two thirds of @entity2 dads would think twice before approaching a child in distress in fear of being labelled a predator			1
parenting researcher dr @entity21 ( pictured ) said this reaction was common ' everybody is potentially a child molester and we treat people like they are , ' dr @entity62 said			2
' it 's almost been a generalised response to no trust men which is a huge problem in many ways			2
' @entity11 inventor @entity23 , who was abducted as a six year old , said he was inspired to create the device after he lost his daughter @entity25 at the beach when she was two			1
‘ i could n’t find her for five minutes and sheer panic , absolute raw emotion goes through your body , ’ mr @entity23 said			0
mr @entity23 said it brought back old memories from when he and a friend were abducted and held for 24 hours by an elderly lady in nearby street			0
' she invited me across the road to eat some mandarins , ' mr @entity23 said			0
' she locked one of us in the cupboard while she played with other , and threatened to hurt the one in the cupboard if the other one ran away			0
' worried about his own children , mr @entity23 could n’t find a device that suited him , so he decided to invent one himself			1
the device is carried on the child and links to the @entity11 app , which can be downloaded to any @entity32 or @entity34 smartphone			1
it provides distance and direction information for users to quickly locate their child , and it alerts the user if a child moves outside of their designated boundary			0
it can also be set to detect that your child is moving away and then you are able to stop them before they wander off			0
but dr @entity62 was sceptical of the usefulness of @entity132 trackers to prevent child abuse			0
dr @entity62 from @entity64 said ' child molesters had become ' the @entity137 bogeyman ' , ' everybody is potentially a child molester and we treat people like they are ' ' more children are abused by people who are very well known to them than by strangers , and a gps device is unlikely to change anything at all , ' she said			1
' the best way to ensure that does n’t happen is to make sure everybody notices children and make everybody is willing to intervene			0
' if you see a child who 's distressed to do nothing is really a very scary option			2
' dr @entity21 said the devices would be useful for special needs children who are prone to wondering			0
' if you ’ve got a typically developing child i do n't believe that devices that track children 's movements are going to be particularly necessary , they 're more for reassurance of parents than for safety of children			1
