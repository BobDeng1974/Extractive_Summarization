a mother - of - three is lucky to be alive after doctors failed to diagnose that the clear liquid streaming from her nose was a brain fluid leak			1
@entity5 , 35 , made several trips to her doctor over a four - month period but was sent home with nasal sprays after being told it was simply allergies			1
mrs @entity5 finally discovered something was seriously wrong last month after being forced to go to the emergency room with liquid pouring from her nose			1
she was diagnosed with a cerebrospinal fluid leak from two cracks in the back of her sphenoid sinus , a potentially fatal condition			1
rare condition : @entity5 , 35 , almost died after having brain fluid leak from her nose for four months support network : mrs @entity5 , pictured with her husband @entity25 and three children @entity27 , 16 , @entity28 , 10 , and nine - year - old @entity29 is expected to recover fully from her surgery she had surgery at the @entity32 in @entity33 to correct the condition which is extremely rare - affecting only one in 100,000 people			1
the condition can be fatal due to the high risk of infections like meningitis rather than from the loss of brain fluid which the body constantly produces			0
mrs @entity5 told @entity44 : ' if i looked down or bent over , it would literally pour out of the left side of my nose			1
i had no control at all			0
' the 35 - year - old said that she was forced to walk around with paper towels shoved up her nose to stop the stream of liquid			2
she said that she would wake up at night choking on fluid			0
however she did not question the doctor 's diagnosis because she also suffers from fibromyalgia and was too busy caring for her three children			0
mrs @entity5 has two sons art , 16 , ten - year - old @entity28 and a daughter @entity29 , nine , who has autism			1
support : mrs @entity5 , pictured with her husband , is lucky to be alive after undergoing a new procedure to stop her leaking brain fluid life - saving : the 35 - year - old mother of three underwent surgery at the @entity32 to correct the cracks in her sinus when the nasal spray did not work on mrs @entity5 , she went to the emergency room last month			1
she said doctors were shocked by the volume of liquid that was coming out of her nose			0
a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome causes the colorless and odorless substance to stream from the nose for no apparent reason			0
it is caused by a hole in the dura mater ( pictured below ) - tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord			2
symptoms can include , headaches and blurry vision , feeling dizzy , nausea , extreme tiredness and a metallic taste in the mouth			0
@entity98 , tingling in arms and legs and weakness of facial muscles are other signs			0
the condition is rare - affecting one in every 100,000 people			2
it is most common around the age of 42 and women are twice as susceptible			0
she was referred to an ear , nose and throat specialist who diagnosed the condition			0
a cerebrospinal fluid leak is more common in overweight patients with high cranial pressure or those who have suffered head trauma from an accident			0
the surgeons at @entity118 have developed a new procedure to repair cracks which cause the brain leak by going up the patient 's nose instead of opening their skull , which is highly risky			2
firstly , dye is injected into the patient which shows up where exactly the cracks are by turning the colorless brain fluid green			2
a team of surgeons use an endoscopic method to reach the sinus via the nostril and graft skin , taken from belly fat , over the cracks			1
the two - hour surgery has a 95 - 99 per cent success rate and should protect mrs @entity5 for the rest of her life			1
however she will be tested several times a year to make sure she does not have another leak			0
mrs @entity5 said she was grateful to the surgeons and that the procedure did not interfere with her religion as a @entity148 as no blood products were used			1
family : mrs @entity5 said she was too busy to question doctors ' opinions that she had allergies because she had to take care of her three children			2

@entity5 was sent home with nasal sprays in @entity33 , @entity159
the mother - of - three had cracks in sphenoid sinus and could have died
