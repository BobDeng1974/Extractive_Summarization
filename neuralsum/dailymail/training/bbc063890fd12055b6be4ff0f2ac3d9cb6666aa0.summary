by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 11:18 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 18:43 est , 19 july 2013 offenders : lord @entity4 said he found that @entity6 families travelling in large 4x4 cars to go skiing in the @entity9 were the most badly behaved most of us do n’t have the time or the energy to reprimand anti-social drivers who drop litter out of their car windows			1
but it seems @entity19 peer @entity4 has both these gifts – and good connections to boot			2
in an extraordinary outburst in a @entity23 debate yesterday , the 75 - year - old told colleagues how he calls his ‘ friends at the @entity29 ’ to obtain the vehicle owner ’s phone number			1
lord @entity4 said he records the number plates of @entity6 cars when abroad if sees litter being dumped on the road before calling up his friends at the @entity29			1
the peer claimed the @entity29 would then use the details to find the telephone numbers of offenders before handing them over			1
but with a possible threat to data protection laws , the @entity29 said it was trying to contact the hereditary peer before considering launching a full probe			2
the @entity43 requires organisations such as the @entity29 to keep the personal information they are processing secure and to have controls on making sure such information is not inappropriately accessed			1
but lord @entity4 told the @entity23 that he found that @entity6 families travelling in large 4x4s to go skiing in the @entity9 were the most badly behaved			1
the peer said : ‘ i find when you look at the international scene that , believe it or not , some of the most badly behaved now are @entity6 families in large 4x4s driving to the @entity9 to ski			1
‘ they are the ones i 've followed occasionally and , for a bit of fun , i 've just taken note of their number and occasionally manage - because i have friends with @entity62 ( a ) - to find their telephone and i give them a ring			2
‘ i just say , ‘ i 'm sorry i happen to be involved in the political world a bit and it was noticed that at a particular point you did this ”			0
‘ and of course most continental motorways have got signs every kilometre or every half kilometre or often more often so you know exactly where you are and so do the spies			0
rubbish : @entity19 peer @entity4 said he notes down the number plates of @entity6 cars he sees littering abroad ‘ if the police themselves are deciding that they may be perhaps a little short of income for @entity84 , the number of fines seems to go up			1
lord @entity4 's speech on littering comes as he marks his 50th anniversary in the @entity23			1
an @entity89 officer , he took his seat in 1963 after his father 's			0
the 76 - year - old is one of just 90 hereditary peers left on the red benches			0
he worked in business and banking before entering @entity97			0
he lists skiiing among his interests and has been president of the @entity103 - @entity102 society , which might explain how he spots the littering drivers in the @entity9			2
he once launched a campaign to find out if there was a legal definition of the role of a peer			2
he was told there was n't			0
' there is of course absolutely no connection between these two issues			0
but this is self - interest			0
’ lord @entity4 made the surprise admission during a debate on a legislation drawn up by former journalist , @entity119 , which calls for anyone caught throwing rubbish out of a vehicle to be fined			1
under the littering from @entity126 , a registered driver would be the automatic recipient of the fine			0
the @entity128 , which stands little chance of becoming law , would require local authorities to publish the details of the contracts awarded in relation to its enforcement			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity29 said : ‘ we are writing to @entity4 to ask him for further information			1
‘ depending on his reply , we will then decide on whether or not it is necessary to conduct a full investigation			0
’ she said drivers were not obliged to provide their telephone numbers when applying for a licence so that in some cases the agency would not hold the details apparently requested by @entity4			2
investigation : the @entity29 said it would contact @entity4 before deciding whether to launch a probe into the potential breach of data protection laws the spokeswoman added : ‘ we take our responsibility to protect information seriously			1
that is why information is only provided under strict controls to those who are legally entitled to it , such as local authorities and the police			2
’ a spokesman for the information commissioner said : ‘ we expect any organisation handling personal information to have appropriate safeguards in place to ensure that access to people 's details is strictly controlled			0
' these arrangements must be effective in practice			0

lord @entity4 says @entity6 families in 4x4s in the @entity9 are worst offenders
he records number plates and uses contacts at @entity29 to find out names
but accessing *private* information could breach @entity43
