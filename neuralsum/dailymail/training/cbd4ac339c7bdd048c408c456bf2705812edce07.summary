@entity1 doctors claim to have cured childhood obesity by following a set of basic rules which include no second helpings of food within 20 minutes of eating			1
snacks and sweets are rationed to once a week , fruit juice or fizzy drinks once a month and children must walk or cycle to school			1
the rules also state that pots are kept in the kitchen at mealtimes - rather than on the table to avoid the temptation of second helpings			1
the rules have been drawn up by @entity1 paediatrician dr @entity23 , who claims to have helped 1,300 overweight and obese children			1
under the diet plan , which has around 20 rules , sweets are rationed to once a week and seconds are rationed as part of @entity31 's treatment protocol children in @entity32 are scanned by doctors who then go on to develop individual plans he first began testing his set of rules – @entity38 ( @entity40 ) protocol – in the town of @entity32 , 40 miles from @entity42 , in 2008			1
but it has been so successful it has been adopted by eight other districts across the country			1
dr @entity23 says it has been so successful across @entity1 that other countries such as @entity50 should follow suit			1
figures published by the @entity53 next month are expected to show that one in three children are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school			1
and only today a report warned that growing numbers of teenagers had become so obese they needed weight loss surgery			2
but dr @entity23 believes his solution is far simpler and cheaper than gastric band or bypass operations , which cost the @entity53 up to £ 15,000 a time			1
it hinges on sticking to between 15 to 20 rules aimed at improving the diet , boosting exercise levels and slashing time spent sat down			2
the plan includes promoting free physical activity after school and not allowing children to watch tv or use a computer before 5pm in the evening other recommendations include serving food in the kitchen - so second helpings are not so readily available - and getting children to school by walking or cycling under @entity38 ( @entity40 ) protocol , a doctor creates a plan comprising 15 - 20 components			1
these , according to the @entity86 , may include : 1 - no crunchy muesli or fruit yoghurts for breakfast - choosing oatmeal , dark brown bread , meat and fish instead 2 - no fast food or white bread for lunch ; choose brown bread , meat , fish and vegetables instead 3 - portions served up in the kitchen - no pots and pans at the dining table 4 - plate proportions for dinner should be : half vegetables , a quarter brown rice , pasta or potatoes , and a quarter low fat fish or meat 5 - wait 20 minutes before having second helpings - this allows time for the body to feel full 6 - feel satisfied after each meal 7 - only two pieces of fruit per day 8 - fast food only once a month 9 - sweets only once a week 10 - snack only once a week 11 - @entity122 juice , iced tea , cocoa , soda or lemonade to once weekly - only half a litre in total 12 - cycle or walk to school 13 - organised physical activity eg dancing , handball or gymnastics 14 - free physical activities like walking / biking after school , walking the dog or trampolining 15 - screen time ( television , computer or tablet ) limited to two hours per day 16 - no television / computer access until 5pm 17 - set a regular , early bedtime one states that children must feel satisfied after each meal so they are n’t tempted to snack later			2
but if they are still hungry after their first helping , they must wait at least 20 minutes for seconds as this is how long it takes for the body to feel ‘ full ’			0
others include no television before 5pm and for no more than two hours a day as well as no white bread for lunch			0
initially they are admitted to hospital for 24 hours where they undergo tests and scans including measurements of body fat , blood sugar and blood pressure			0
they also answer a very detailed questionnaire about their diets and lifestyle , with the help of their parents			0
doctors then help them draw up a more specific set of rules tailored to their likes , dislikes and routines			2
these stay in place until the child has reached their target weight			0
dr @entity180 said that of the 1,900 patients who have been put on the program since its launch , some 70 per cent have lost significant amounts of weight and kept it off for at least four years			2
he said : ‘ in general , obese children are neglected			1
they are often lonely and many of them do n't participate in activities with their peers			0
they lack self - confidence			0
‘ with this scheme there is a real hope they can lose weight and have a good quality of life			0
‘ we create the environment and tools with which the children and their families can overcome this			2
’ dr @entity23 says that , unless children change these habits , the ‘ obesity will persist '			1
‘ people will get very frustrated , sad , and they will be lost , ' he said			0
‘ their entire life needs to be changed , because they tend to be lonely , tend to be ashamed of themselves so they need to do this , and to interact with other children in their daily lives			0
' a report by the @entity218 – which includes obesity surgeons - today found that 550 men and women under 25 had needed weight - loss surgery			0
this included 62 under 18s – which it stated was evidence of a ‘ clear failure ’ of strategies to prevent obesity .			0
