by @entity0 a coroner has criticised the @entity2 for a series of failures which led to the deaths of two soldiers in a fire as they slept at @entity8 in @entity9			1
@entity10 , 23 , and @entity11 , 28 - plus one survivor - were sleeping in a tented office so they could respond more quickly when vital supplies arrived			1
but in the early hours of @entity16 2011 witnesses could smell smoke and went out to see flames engulfing the air - conditioned canvas unit			2
tragic : @entity10 , 23 ( left ) , and @entity11 , 28 ( right ) , died in the fire on february 14 , 2011 today @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , condemned a string of ' contributory factors ' to the deaths - including a broken fire alarm			1
the @entity2 now has 56 days to reply in writing with details of actions that have been taken to prevent future similar deaths			1
@entity31 , known as @entity32 , had become a father to a boy , @entity34 , shortly before he died			0
he was a driver port operator , posted to 17 @entity36 and @entity37 , and lived in @entity38			0
@entity40 , from @entity39 , was a driver and had seven years ’ service with the @entity42			0
the inquest heard that both senior commanders and fire safety officers did not know the soldiers were sleeping on duty during night shifts at the base in @entity50			1
witnesses described struggling to get hold of emergency services when they saw the @entity55 unit was ablaze			0
private @entity56 , who was woken by the smell of smoke , fled the canvas tent to raise the alarm but soldiers at the scene did not know the emergency 222 number			1
he told the court he could hear @entity40 calling his name			0
by the time firefighters arrived at the scene , the blaze had taken hold of the tent , with flames approximately 3ft high and only the metal tent poles remaining of the structure			2
they had been sleeping in the canvas tent in @entity8 ( pictured ) to be closer to vital supplies being delivered fire investigators have concluded that the blaze started in the vicinity of the electrical appliances - including a 32in flat - screen tv , boiler and fridge , and a nearby air conditioning unit			1
the fire quickly spread , igniting combustible materials stored nearby , the court heard			1
recording a narrative conclusion , mr @entity21 listed the seven errors that led to the deaths of @entity40 and @entity31 : ' the systemic failure by the chain of command to communicate the occurrence of sleeping on duties at night to key personnel , such as the unit fire safety officer , as safety measures associated with this practice to all @entity55 personnel			2
' the failure to police the occurrence of sleeping on duties at night through the use of random checks			0
' the failure to effectively check the working functionality of the nine - volt smoke detector located inside the tent where the fire started , resulting in it not being in working order at the time of the fire			2
' the systemic failure to provide effective training , especially to fire @entity118 , to identify the potential risk of the overloading of sockets and extension blocks			0
the @entity2 now has 56 days to make or plan measures to prevent future similar deaths of soldiers ' the failure to rectify the error in the december 2010 fire risk assessment , when it became known that sleeping was taking place within the tent in december 2010			1
' the failure to request a fresh fire risk assessment following the structural alterations that took place in january 2011			2
' the absence of the @entity55 tent from the theatre asset register			0
' the court heard senior officers were not certain who was responsible for checking the smoke detectors in the @entity55 tent			1
it also emerged senior officers were not certain who was responsible for checking the smoke detectors in the @entity55 tent			0
the rear of the @entity55 tent was not permanently sealed and could be opened by unzipping the fire retardant inner lining and undoing the toggles to the canvas door			0
but the rear door to the adjacent @entity154 ’s tent was tied up tightly and also padlocked , the inquest was told			0
since the tragedy a number of changes have been made by the @entity2 and @entity42 to improve safety for troops using tents .			2
