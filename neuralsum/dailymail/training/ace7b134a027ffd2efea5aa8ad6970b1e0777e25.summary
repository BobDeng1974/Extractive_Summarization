by @entity0 @entity1 might be the sporting event of the @entity3 summer season but this year ’s tournament has so far failed to serve any surprises			1
but there has been one attraction causing a stir amongst female tennis fans : @entity11 ’s hair			1
@entity13 ’s 26 - year - old girlfriend may cut a reserved — some might even say dull — figure in the stands , but her lustrous , sun - kissed locks have become a @entity1 star in their own right			1
grand slam : the @entity11 cut proved a big hit with @entity0 ( left ) as a change from her natural auburn hair			1
@entity11 , the first lady of @entity1 applauding boyfriend @entity13 earlier this week ( right ) before : @entity0 's natural auburn hair			1
her hair transformation started in @entity28 , a salon specialising in hair extensions in @entity32 's trendy @entity31 the so - called ‘ @entity40 ’ — a soft cascade of glossy , caramel - hued tresses — has inspired such awe and admiration that a top @entity32 hair salon is currently offering wannabe tennis @entity36 the chance to recreate @entity11 ’s signature look			1
as a 42 - year - old mum whose chin - length bob is as flat as @entity45 , this offer is irresistible			2
admittedly , the @entity11 makeover costs an eye - watering £ 1,000 — enough to make a dent in even a champion ’s prize money — but if it can transform my hair into a head - turning @entity1 winner , surely it ’s worth it ? i head to @entity28 , a salon specialising in hair extensions in @entity32 ’s trendy @entity31			1
while it ’s thought @entity11 ’s hair is all her own , i ’m going to need to cheat a little			1
there i meet owner @entity60 , 31 , and expert colourist @entity61 , 28 , who will mastermind the whole process			0
the salon has a growing female client - base happy to spend , on average , a staggering £ 500 on extensions per visit , rather more than the £ 50 my appointments usually cost			1
glossy : @entity11 at @entity1 earlier this week			1
to recreate @entity11 's mane , @entity0 needed a full head of 22 - inch extensions			1
that 's two - and - a - half ponytails ' worth , costing around £ 700 no synthetic glued - on horrors here ; the extensions used are made from the highest quality real hair , which is blended to match the customer ’s own tones			1
the salon ’s technique is so popular that it gets through 25kg of hair every six weeks			2
@entity60 explains that achieving @entity11 ’s look will involve two stages ; first lightening my natural auburn to recreate her ones , then adding extensions for the swooshy length			1
i have to admit that despite being thrilled about the possibility of achieving @entity11 ’s celebrated coiffure , i am filled with trepidation			2
my locks may be lacklustre , but they are untreated — what @entity60 calls ‘ virgin hair ’ — and consequently undamaged			2
i worry my makeover will do serious harm , though i ’m reassured that a one - off will be fine			2
@entity61 inspects a picture of @entity11 at @entity1 this week and observes : ‘ her look is very glamorous but also natural — almost as if she got her colour by sitting in the stands			1
’ @entity105 : @entity11 ' sleek hair looks glamorous , but natural			1
@entity0 's natural colour was ' lifted ' a multitude of fine highlights , using a low peroxide tint that lightens her hair while keeping it soft i wonder if i have any hope of achieving this effect with my reddy - brown strands , but @entity61 , a colourist with ten years ’ experience , has a plan			1
she will ‘ lift ’ my natural colour with a multitude of fine highlights , using a low peroxide tint that will lighten my hair while keeping the texture soft and natural			0
producing three shades of permanent colour — mid blonde ash , dark blonde ash and honey blonde — @entity61 proceeds to take tiny sections of hair , painting each with a single colour			0
the strands are then wrapped in foil and left to develop			0
@entity61 puts more than 80 foils in my hair — what ’s called a three - quarter head of highlights			2
an hour - and - a - half later she completes the procedure with ‘ balayage ’ — colour painted on to the tips to accentuate them , which she assures me will flatter the contours of my face			0
the colour is then left on for a further 35 minutes			0
sleek : @entity11 at @entity1 earlier this week			1
the hair stylist @entity60 worked for four hours fitting more than 250 extensions to give @entity11 's thick locks when my hair has been washed and rough - dried i am pleasantly surprised			1
the colour is n’t the dramatic departure i had feared			0
it is , however , noticeably lighter , almost as if i had just returned from a long summer holiday or , indeed , a few weeks watching tennis under sunny skies			0
@entity60 now takes over to add the extensions			0
the hair the salon uses arrives in thick ponytails , in a huge variety of natural shades			2
the ponytails come in lengths of 14 to 22 inches ( the most popular is the 18 - inch ‘ boob ’ length ) and cost £ 150 to £ 250 from her supplier			1
to recreate @entity11 ’s mane , i will need a full head of 22 - inch extensions			1
that ’s two - and - a - half ponytails ’ worth , costing around £ 700			2
@entity60 expertly selects hair from four ponytails : light blonde , light ash , dark ash and golden			0
she brushes the strands together and holds them up to my hair			0
to my astonishment , the shades are almost identical			0
to create extensions , small strands are taken and bonded with keratin resin — a brown glue - like substance — at one end to form ‘ tips ’ like the ends of a shoelace			2
coveted : @entity11 ' hair			1
the final step of @entity0 's makeover is to have her new head of hair is washed and blow - dried to give it @entity11 's signature va - va - voom @entity60 works for four hours fitting more than 250 extensions — it ’s a long process			1
as the locks begin to tumble over my shoulders , i give a toss of my head			2
three people stand back to make way for my flying tresses			0
i begin to get a sense of what power hair can do			0
once it ’s complete , i look in the mirror			0
but my heart sinks ; instead of a tennis princess , i look like an ageing schoolgirl badly in need of a haircut			0
but it ’s now that @entity219 , another hairdresser , takes over to trim the shapeless extensions into soft layers			0
at the same time my own hair is cut so it blends as smoothly as possible			2
finally my new head of hair is washed and blow - dried to give it @entity11 ’s signature va - va - voom			1
my verdict : i am stunned			0
swishing it from side to side my hair is soft and lustrous and , having avoided colour for years , i am pleasantly surprised by the subtle yet distinctive result			2
but what will my family think ? my son , kit , sees me first			0
‘ you look weird , ’ he tells me			0
but 15 - year - old @entity238 — my toughest critic — is surprisingly positive : ‘ you look really young , mummy			0
’ meanwhile , my husband , a man who does n’t mince words , says he is impressed , although he comments that my voluminous tresses somewhat dwarf my 5ft 4in frame			0
i look like i might topple over			0
the best comes that evening when a friend pops in and says that he mistook me for a friend of @entity238 ’s			0
i ’d love to believe him			0
so could i pass for radiant @entity11 ? well , no , i am still a middle - aged mother - of - three			1
but can i carry off her championship - winning hair ? the answer , i think , is a resounding ‘ yes ’			2
now all i need is a vip pass for @entity45			0
@entity28 ( @entity253 ) is 194 – 196 hoxton street , @entity253 , @entity254 , 0207 729 6263 , vixenandblush.com so why did @entity13 choose @entity255 as his new coach ? maybe she reminds him of his biggest fan ... crowd - pleaser : let 's hope @entity13 gives @entity255 ( left ) and girlfriend @entity11 a reason to smile tearing their hair out : an early exit could be bad news for @entity255 and @entity11 's locks staring daggers : expect scowls from the stands if any umpire crosses @entity13 nail - biting : coach and girlfriend alike show the strain of a nerve - racking match looking swish : @entity255 and @entity11 keep it simple and sporting with matching ponytails			1
