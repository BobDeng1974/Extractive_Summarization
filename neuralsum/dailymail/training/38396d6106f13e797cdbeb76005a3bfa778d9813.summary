by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter western drought has left @entity4 on @entity5 less than half full , with satellite images captured this month revealing the strained reservoir is sitting at just 42 percent capacity			1
according to the @entity10 @entity9 ( @entity9 ) data , the lake , which sits on the border of @entity14 and @entity15 and is crucial for both water and electricity , has been depleted by the drought , and is now not much more than a muddy river along an empty river bed			1
some 20 million people drink water from the reservoir			1
in 2000 , @entity4 was at 94 percent of capacity , according to @entity26 's @entity25 , which released the image			1
depleted : @entity4 is a major reservoir on the @entity5			1
according to the @entity10 @entity29 is currently only at 42 percent of capacity as of may 20			1
this image was captured by a @entity26 satellite on may 12 , 2014 @entity4 , the nation 's second - largest manmade reservoir , was at only 42 percent capacity as of tuesday in 2000 , @entity4 was at 94 percent of capacity			1
drought over the years in the southwestern @entity10 has taken a toll on the huge reservoir @entity4 has slowly dried up over the years as a result of the drought			2
this image was taken in april 2010 according to @entity25 " water levels are expected to rebound to about 51 percent of capacity by october 2014 , the end of the water year @entity4 is a major vacation spot , with about two million people visiting each year but 14 straight years of drought have done a number on @entity4 's levels			1
between now and then , all but three years have been years of drought			0
the reservoir will probably top out around 51 percent of capacity in 2014			2
experts say the snow packs in the northern reaches of the @entity5 are above - average , and as the snow melts the water will run into the river			2
@entity4 levels are likely to drop even more over the next few years , perhaps reaching 3,536 feet ( 1,080 meters ) above sea level , or 164 feet ( 50 m ) feet lower than a full pool of 3,700 feet ( 1,128 m ) above sea level			0
to get a sense of the amount of volume lost in that sort of drop , consider that @entity4 covers 254 square miles ( 658 square kilometers )			0
before : in 2011 , @entity4 , northeast of @entity69 , @entity70 , was almost full , sitting at a capacity of 97 percent after : the capacity of @entity73 in january was just 17 percent , a whopping 80 percent lower than what it was 2.5 years ago as of may 21 , @entity4 was about 117 feet ( 36 m ) below full pool , at 3,583 feet ( 1,092 m ) above sea level			2
the effects of a half - full @entity4 are varied			2
@entity79 , which encompasses the lake and much of its surroundings , is currently warning park visitors to take care using boat launch ramps into the park			0
because the water levels are so low , water on the ramps is very shallow and leads to sudden drop - offs			0
but tourists may have reasons other than boating to come to the area			0
the lower - than - usual water levels have revealed spots flooded after the creation of the @entity97 in the 1960s			0
among these spots are the @entity99 in the @entity100 , a water - carved grotto partially exposed by low lake levels			0
parched : water levels for many of @entity70 's major reservoirs are well below average and dropping ; concern is mounting that @entity70 may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s , or even worse , 1977 parched : a warning buoy sits on the dry , cracked bed of @entity113 near @entity114 , @entity70 the reservoir measured a capacity of about 37 percent earlier this year another beloved spot , @entity118 , features an exposed arch that boaters can float beneath			1
the low water has also revealed bad news in the form of an extensive infestation of quagga mussels , an invasive species that multiply quickly , compete with native species for food and can clog water intake pipes			0
in february , @entity131 officials reported that dropping water levels had revealed more than 1,000 mussels attached to canyon walls , the @entity97 and other underwater structures .			0

@entity4 , the nation 's second - largest man - made reservoir , was at only 42 percent capacity as of tuesday
*located* on @entity5 on the border of @entity14 and @entity15
in 2000 its capacity was *recorded* at 94 percent
some 20 million drink from the reservoir
over two million vacation there each year
*dam* will go up by october as melted snow feeds the lake
