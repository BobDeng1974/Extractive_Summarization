the author moved into @entity17 in 1856 , using the money he had earned from novels such as @entity34 , a @entity35 and @entity36			2
he used to take the train from @entity38 to @entity39 , the nearest station to his home , before getting in a horse - drawn carriage to take him the rest of the way			2
but in june 1862 , his regular route almost got him in trouble - as reported by local paper the @entity49 , which wrote about a ' diabolical attempt to overturn mr @entity1 ' carriage ' by farm worker @entity52			1
@entity1 was supposed to arrive at @entity39 at 10.30pm to be met by his groom , @entity53 , but he missed the train and the groom returned to @entity17			1
the newspaper reported : ' a little distance on he found two rollers lying across the road , which , had they not been perceived in time , would have caused serious mischief			0
' @entity62 , a fellow workman of the prisoner , had accompanied @entity52 from @entity64 to @entity39 by the 9.30 , and when passing through the village saw mr @entity1 ' carriage drive down to the station			2
' the prisoner immediately afterwards went into a field and drew the two rollers across the road to upset the carriage on its return			0
@entity62 at the time held the gate open for the prisoner			0
' transport : @entity1 pictured in a horse - drawn carriage with his wife and daughters home : @entity1 moved in to @entity17 , near @entity18 in @entity19 , in 1856 after the incident , @entity52 sought refuge in a pub across the road from @entity1 ' home , where he played skittle - but was soon caught by the police			1
he was charged at @entity87 with ' placing a horse - roller , and also a hand roller , on the middle of the turnpike road , at a late hour on saturday night , with the intention of upsetting the carriage of mr @entity1 , which was returning from the @entity39 railway station '			2
@entity52 pleaded drunkenness as his excuse , but a month later it emerged that he had done the same thing on a different road in a bid to overturn someone else 's carriage , and he was sentenced to two months ' hard labour			0
in 1859 , @entity104 was jailed for three days after he stole hay from @entity1 ' home , which was one of the grandest in the area			1
rubbish dumping was also a concern for @entity1 , as in 1858 he was forced to write to a local pub landlord who continuously left his property a mess			0
family : @entity1 reads to his daughters in the grounds of the home , which he bought at the height of his fame @entity1 wrote : ' mr @entity1 begs mr @entity64 to be so good as to give directions that no rubbish or refuse from the @entity123 to be thrown into the shrubbery of @entity17			1
' mr @entity1 also hopes that mr @entity64 will advise his customers not to trespass on that ground , in going from the @entity123 to the village			0
' he wishes very earnestly to live on good terms with his neighbours of all degrees and he hopes that they know it , and will not fee disinclined to respect his property			0

@entity157 , editor of @entity30 , said : ' i was brought up in the village of @entity39 , near where @entity1 lived , and have always been an admirer , so was delighted to alight upon this incident tucked away in the @entity28			1
' @entity52 was a fairly hopeless type of criminal , nowhere as impressive as the list of malefactors in @entity1 's novels , but worthy of a minor role			0
