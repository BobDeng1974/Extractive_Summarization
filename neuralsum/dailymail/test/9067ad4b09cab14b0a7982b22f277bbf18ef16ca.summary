two birds of prey have been caught on camera brutally fighting over a nesting box , staring each other down before attacking each other with sharp talons and beaks			1
a kestrel and a barn owl repeatedly lunged at each other while trying to gain mastery of the box so they could lay eggs and rear their young in safety			1
and despite the owl 's cuddly reputation , it came out the victor , forcing the kestrel to seek an alternative home for itself and its mate			0
face - off : a barn owl and a kestrel have been caught on camera fighting in a nesting box conflict : the two birds of prey lunged at each other in a vicious scrap the fight was captured on video by wildlife photographer @entity31 , using a camera he set up inside a 13ft - high elm tree stump in his garden in @entity35 , @entity36			1
he said that a pair of kestrels had been guarding the nesting box in the tree , but when they left in the evening a barn owl swooped in and laid a claim to the nest			1
after the owl drove the kestrels away he managed to attract a mate to share his new home - but the kestrels found an alternative nesting box in mr @entity31 's garden			1
the cameras were set up as part of an exhibition at mr @entity31 's gallery , monitoring the nest of blackbirds , blue tits and pheasants as well as birds of prey			2
confrontation : the kestrel was attempting to win back the nesting box after guarding it all day flurry : a video camera captured the vicious fight , with the two birds throwing themselves at each other on top : at one point the kestrel had the owl up against the wall of the box inside an old tree stump mr @entity31 said : ' the nest has been used in the past by tawny owls and this year the kestrels were showing a lot of interest in it			1
' the female was guarding it during the day then in the evening a male barn owl started coming in and calling for a mate			1
' the kestrel and barn owl battle is absolutely spectacular footage			1
it 's much more exciting than any soap or drama on tv			0
' in the footage you can see the barn owl lands and the kestrel comes right behind and hits so hard it knocks it inside and into the nest wall			2
' both birds are very well equipped to kill things , they have very sharp talons			0
they often have disputes in the air but here they were in a very confined space			0
turnaround : despite the kestrel 's more aggressive reputation , the barn owl ended up defeating it @entity111 : at the end of the video the owl can be seen admiring its new home ' at the beginning the barn owl was looking for an escape route but the male kestrel keeps appearing at the opening			2
' @entity121 have a terrier mentality , they 're aggressive			0
barn owls are n't really but they do have very long legs and talons , it was a fairly even battle			0
' the kestrels have been here since 2006 and i feed them in the garden , they 're like part of the family			0
but the barn owl is my favourite bird and i wanted them to nest here too			2
i did n't want either of them to get injured			0
' the barn owl won , he 's found a mate now and the kestrels are in a different nesting box in my garden			1
the female is guarding it day and night , she 's not going to get caught out again			0
' barn owls and kestrels are both attracted to nests which overlook open land , meaning that it is fairly common for them to compete for the same nesting space .			0
