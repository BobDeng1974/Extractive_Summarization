for years , all @entity1 the @entity0 knew was a life of roaming the streets , rifling through trash cans in the hope of finding a meal			1
but for one week , he got to experience unwavering love thanks to @entity8 and her daughter @entity10 , who found him in @entity12 , @entity13 and threw him a party before he was put to sleep			1
as a puppy , the terrier had an owner and a home but , after a couple of years , the owner cast the dog out and he was left to live in the streets , @entity17 reported			0
he lived off scraps and found shelter from the frost , but a week before @entity29 , @entity8 and her daughter discovered him lying in a front yard , struggling to breathe			1
the vet suggested he be scheduled for a ' humane euthanasia ' and the women planned a final hurrah for the dog			0
for a few blissful days over @entity29 , he feasted on burgers and pumpkin pie , enjoyed playing with new toys and relished in the attention from his temporary owners			1
then they threw him an early @entity67 ' going away ' party , where he sat on @entity70 's lap and donned a party hat as he opened more gifts			2
care : the dog , who had a swollen heart , experienced more love in his last few days than he did in his life treats : @entity1 , pictured with @entity10 and friends left , took trips to @entity81 for new toys and treats at home : @entity1 , pictured grinning with @entity10 , showed marked improvement during his few days of joy the @entity87 noticed that @entity1 perked up after all the attention and was no longer struggling to breathe , so the trip to the vet was put off			1
but a few days later , his condition worsened again			0
' before he goes , i want him to look into my eyes , and i want to look into his eyes , and i want to whisper , " i love you " , ' she told @entity17			0
' i want him to hear those words and to see those faces of the people who love him			0
' last saturday , she carried out her wish and put @entity1 down with her family by their sides			2
she said that she was overjoyed that she could bring a few days of joy to the abandoned pup and that she saw him become hopeful in that final week			2
' the heart can do so many things when it gets what it needs , ' she said			0
dog days : @entity1 took a turn for the worse at the end of last week and was put down on saturday			1

@entity8 and her daughter found @entity1 struggling to breathe in a yard in @entity12 , @entity13 the week before @entity29

he feasted on burgers and met @entity70 at a party thrown in his honor
