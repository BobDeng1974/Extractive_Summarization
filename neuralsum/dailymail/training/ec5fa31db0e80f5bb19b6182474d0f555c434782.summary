trainer @entity0 says his flying two - year - old @entity1 is now ‘ unlikely ’ to run in sunday ’s @entity2 at @entity3			1
initial enthusiasm for the @entity6 raid after @entity1 won saturday ’s @entity7 at @entity8 has quickly evaporated			1
@entity0 said : ‘ we have n’t completely made up our minds but i am not keen and would say it is unlikely she will run			0
@entity1 ridden by @entity13 wins the @entity15 's @entity14 the two - year - old ' unlikely ' to run in sunday ’s @entity16 according to @entity0 ‘ she has done plenty this season and won her @entity7			1
i think enough might be enough for her			0
’ @entity1 is 7 - 2 favourite to become the first two - year - old to win the @entity23 since @entity24 in 1978			1
if she is scratched , jockey @entity13 will be free to maintain his partnership with @entity27 ’s @entity26 on whom he was won both the @entity7 @entity29 and @entity30 this summer			1

a poor run from @entity47 is likely to see her retired			0
in two runs this season , the four - time @entity2 winner has been unplaced behind @entity56 in the @entity57 at @entity58 and the @entity59 at the @entity8 july course			2
sir @entity61 ’s @entity56 will be in opposition again while @entity63 is poised to be three - handed with @entity64 , @entity65 and miss @entity66 , this season ’ s guineas winner , intended starters			2
