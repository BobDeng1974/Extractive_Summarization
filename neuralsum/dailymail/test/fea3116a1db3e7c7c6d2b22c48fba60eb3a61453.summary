he played in 64 tests as a leg - spinning all - rounder and captained @entity3 to world dominance in the 1950s but to millions of fans @entity6 , who died last night aged 84 , was the voice of cricket			1
the great commentator , who had been receiving treatment for skin cancer since november , began broadcasting for the @entity12 while still a player in 1963 and carried on until a car crash forced him out of the commentary box in 2013			1
it was hoped he would still be able to commentate on the @entity17 in @entity3 and @entity18 earlier this year but ill - health sadly ended hopes of one last masterclass			1
@entity6 was one of cricket 's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge @entity6 was the voice of cricket for generations , commentating in his native @entity3 and for the @entity12 @entity6 , pictured on his wedding day to wife @entity29 , and during his time as @entity3 captain @entity6 , quite simply , was the voice of summer , both in his native land and in @entity35 , as much for what he did not say as what he did			1
always understated , @entity6 knew when to let the pictures do the talking before entering our living rooms with just the right words			1
he took 248 test wickets and hit 2,201 runs , with three centuries , and reclaimed the ashes for @entity3 as captain before successfully defending them twice			1
his commentary rules should be required reading for anyone entering the commentary box today			0
they included these : never ask a statement ; there are no teams in the world called we or they ; avoid cliches and banalities ; remember that the @entity59 was a tragedy and the @entity62 drought a disaster and neither bears any relation to a dropped catch and , most importantly , do n’t take yourself too seriously and have some fun			2
watch @entity69 's ball of the century with @entity70 @entity71 for bowling @entity72 to prevent @entity18 from scoring from final ball of 1981 match @entity6 was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in tests @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity6 assembled a formidable line - up for the @entity12 in 1995 a master with the microphone to his lips , @entity6 also was well aware of the power of silence january 1952 : test debut against @entity88 at @entity89 january 1952 : first of 248 test wickets and 2,201 @entity92 runs december 1958 : first test as @entity3 captain , v @entity35 at @entity95 summer 1960 : first radio commentary for @entity12 december 1963 : in his 60th test , the first to 2,000 @entity92 runs & 200 wickets summer 1963 : first television commentary for @entity12 february 1964 : final test against @entity105 at @entity89 september 2005 : final commentary in @entity35 after 42 years in becoming one of the leading figures of @entity111 ’s @entity110 revolution in the 1970s @entity6 gave the fledgling breakaway group the voice of authority they required			1
yet any suggestion of his being anti-establishment has long since been forgotten and the leading figures in @entity119 cricket and life queued up to pay tribute to arguably the most famous @entity119 of them all last night			1
‘ there would hardly be an @entity119 over the last 40 years who has n’t listened to @entity6 , ’ said @entity119 prime minister @entity123 , and that could also apply to @entity126 men and women			1
‘ he certainly will be very , very much missed			0
’ today @entity123 offered @entity6 's family a state funeral for him , if they wish it			1
@entity134 chairman @entity133 said : ‘ our country has lost a national treasure			0
after @entity139 , there has been no @entity119 player more famous or more influential than @entity6			1
’ @entity6 never lost the ability to say absolutely the right thing and that was never more in evidence than in what will go down as his last significant public words			1
an evocative 30 second tribute to the late @entity148 was prepared for @entity149 by @entity6 when , as ever , he captured the mood perfectly			1
@entity6 ( front left ) leads @entity3 off at @entity152 in 1961 as @entity35 collapsed against his side 's spin @entity6 , pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book @entity157 , was widely respected and loved @entity6 pays tribute to @entity119 media mogul and cricket pioneer @entity111 after his death in 2005 ' a boy just beginning , 25 years of age , baggy green number 408 , ' read @entity6 in what were still his unmistakable tones when the cricket world had to endure what really was a tragedy with the death of a young player at the @entity89			1
' his father 's best mate , son , brother , fighter , friend , inspiration			2
@entity148 , forever rest in peace son			0
' the whole cricketing world will be echoing those sentiments for the greatest commentator of them all			2
@entity6 , who was made an obe in 1961 for services to cricket , left a wife of 48 years in @entity29 and two children from his first marriage			1
he will forever set the standards for others to follow			0
tributes are seen at the statue of @entity6 at the @entity89 after his passing aged 84 @entity196 ' what i want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that , when i say something , i am talking to friends			1
' ' my mantra is : put your brain into gear and if you can add to what 's on the screen then do it , otherwise shut up			2
' ' the key thing was to learn the value of economy with words and to never insult the viewer by telling them what they can already see			0
' ' out in the field , you have n't got anyone whispering into your ear saying all sorts of things , you 've got to do it yourself			0
' @entity225 ' the hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss , at the right time			0
' ' captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill			2
but do n't try it without that 10 per cent			0
' @entity235 ' @entity236 is not the worst batsman there is at international level but those who are worse would not need to hire the @entity241 to hold a convention			0
' ' @entity243 dismissed for two , just ninety - eight runs short of his century			1
' ' he 's not quite got hold of that one			2
if he had , it would have gone for nine			0
' @entity250 ' a bleeding ring finger at the end of every training session was not only normal but essential for my development as a wrist spinner			0
' ' your wrist must be cocked , but not stiffly cocked			0
' ' you must always look where you want to land it			0
if i offered you 10,000 dollars to hit a tin can , you 'd never take your eyes off it			2
' on @entity265 ' if any form of game can pull 20,000 spectators into a game of cricket it 's great for the sport			1
i think it 's wonderful			2
' ' as long as the people who run the game have brains and keep three forms of the game i think it will be terrific			2
' on @entity69 's ' @entity280 ' @entity281 has absolutely no idea what has happened to it			2
' @entity286 1981 's ' @entity285 ' scandal ' a disgraceful performance from a captain who got his sums wrong			0
it should never be permitted to happen again			0
one of the worst things i have ever seen done on a cricket field			0
' miscellaneous ' the slow - motion replay does n't show how fast the ball was really travelling			0
' ' a cricket ground is a flat piece of earth with some buildings around it			0
' ' he 's usually a good puller - but he could n't get it up that time			0
' ' @entity134 has changed for the better ... it 's because of what happened then , cricket is so strong now			1
