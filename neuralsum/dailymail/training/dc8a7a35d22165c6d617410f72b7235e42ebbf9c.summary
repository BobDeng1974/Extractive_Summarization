@entity0 has never sought an explanation why he was left behind at @entity2 when his friend @entity3 took over at @entity4 last year and took other members of the @entity7 backroom team to join him			1
‘ i was never asked and i did n’t expect to be asked , ’ said @entity8 head coach @entity0 , who had worked with @entity3 for eight years on @entity9 , first as assistant manager and then academy director in a second spell at the club			1
‘ @entity3 is a very loyal person and he would have wanted to look after the first - team staff he had at @entity2			1
i was in the academy so i was n’t surprised not to get a call			0
i ’m glad the way things worked out for me			0
sitting in his office awaiting the visit of @entity28 ’s ‘ new @entity4 ’ on monday night , he is enjoying his unlikely opportunity in the top flight limelight			1
known as a hard - working and diligent coach , his days as a no 1 appeared over after being sacked by lower league clubs @entity35 and @entity34 , despite a 40 per cent winning ratio at both			1
but when @entity8 decided they could do with less drama after dressing - room fights and @entity43 ’s infamous quenelle gesture last season , they turned to the healing powers of @entity45 , who helped develop the talent of @entity48 , among others , in his career			1
‘ it ’s a chance i did n’t really expect but i ’ve got unfinished business , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ my other two jobs in management were extremely tough			0
i was at clubs where i had to do everything myself			0
‘ @entity35 only had one scout and wednesday did n’t even have that			1
i ’d spend my nights up and down the motorways checking on players and then have to go in the next morning bright and bubbly for training			2
forward @entity19 ( centre ) has praised @entity45 's personable approach to management this season @entity45 does n't hold a grudge after @entity3 did n't offer him a role on moving to @entity4 @entity0 was sacked by both @entity68 ( left ) and @entity34 after unforgiving tasks ‘ i once signed seven players while i was on holiday because the deals would n’t have been done otherwise			1
i can concentrate on what i do and enjoy best , working on the training pitch and analysing games			0
there are other people to do other things			0
‘ at wednesday i did the contract negotiations but here i do n’t even know what some of the players earn ... and that ’s fine by me			1
’ @entity0 ’s summer appointment underwhelmed many @entity8 fans who wanted a bigger , more experienced name			1
the dissenters were not exactly pacified by two draws and two defeats in @entity8 ’s opening four games			1
but evidence the players were buying into @entity0 ’s methods were underlined by a run of three wins in a row against @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			1
they were unlucky to lose their last match 2 - 1 at @entity102			0
@entity103 under 21 striker @entity19 has emerged as the country ’s hottest young striker with six goals this season under @entity0 ’s watchful eye			1
last season @entity19 stunned @entity4 and @entity3 with the winner as @entity8 won at @entity110 for the first time since 1978			1
@entity112 - haired @entity0 may resemble a friendly neighbour rather than someone who would headbutt an opposing player or shove a rival , as other @entity118 managers have done			2
but it would be wrong to dismiss him as a boardroom patsy simply because he carries the title of head coach rather than manager			1
‘ people make a thing of that but there ’s no real difference between the power i ’ve got compared with other @entity118 managers , ’ he says			0
‘ yes , i am sure @entity8 would sell a player i do n’t want to lose if the price is high enough			2
do you think the @entity96 manager wanted to sell @entity137 ? once a value is met , the club decide			0
‘ on signing players , the club were already down the line with @entity142 and @entity143 before i was appointed			2
but it does n’t mean i do n’t consider them my players			2
‘ @entity142 has been brilliant and played every game			0
i do my own research on potential targets			0
i rang @entity148 about @entity149 because he knew him well from @entity150			0
the club take my views into account			0
we ’ve pulled the plug on one or two if they ’ve not been a good fit			0
’ goalkeeper @entity158 has continued his fine form between the sticks for the @entity8 since @entity45 's arrival @entity19 has gone on record that @entity45 ’s approachable manner has helped after losing his way under @entity165			1
also , centre - half @entity166 has become a regular after being overlooked by previous managers			0
‘ @entity142 wanted to go to @entity98 in the summer , ( but ) i promised him if he got in the team and played well , i ’d keep him in , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ and that is what ’s happened			0
’ the experience of older players @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity158 and @entity177 is also valued			2
@entity174 , who left @entity178 in the summer , has been quizzed by @entity0 about any useful tips picked up with the @entity118 champions			2
@entity0 has always been thorough , bordering on workaholic			2
but he accepts that learning when to switch off can be vital			0
for the first time , he has just taken a mid-season break , spending four days in @entity184 during the international fixture list			0
‘ @entity188 [ @entity187 ] , our technical director , said i should go away , it was a new thing for me but i ’m glad i did , ’ he says with a smile			0
@entity0 was heavily involved in bringing through a teenage @entity48 at @entity2 over a decade ago he has seen @entity4 live three times this season to prepare for monday			1
‘ of course they have fantastic players but every team has a weakness somewhere and it ’s up to us to try and exploit it , ’ he says			0
@entity48 will miss the game with suspension and an additional bonus for @entity45 is that several of his players have returned after positive results with their country , most notably the @entity205 trio of @entity176 , @entity175 and @entity206			2
@entity4 sacked @entity3 and his assistants @entity207 and @entity209 ( who both followed him from @entity2 ) after just 10 months and have changed half of their team since then , with stellar names like @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 signing for big money			1
loyally , @entity0 feels he should have been facing his friend across the technical area			2
‘ @entity3 would have got it right at @entity4 , i am sure of that , ’ he said			1
it is just another incentive for the @entity118 ’s most surprising manager to pull off another tale of the unexpected .			0

@entity8 head coach has enjoyed a positive start at the @entity229
@entity0 does n't know how much his players earn
former @entity35 boss signed new faces on his own at @entity34
@entity0 does n't *begrudge* @entity3 not *inviting* him to join the @entity24 on arrival at @entity4
