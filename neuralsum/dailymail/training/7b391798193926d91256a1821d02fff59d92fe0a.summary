by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:42 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 06:42 est , 23 june 2012 internet phenomenon @entity2 , who counts @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity7 education secretary @entity6 among her fans , has managed to raise £ 100,000 through her blog about her school dinners			1
the nine - year - old schoolgirl first hit the headlines with her blog @entity11 about her measly school dinners but the real frenzy came after her council banned her from taking photos of her food as media coverage allegedly left catering staff fearing for their jobs			1
the controversial ban led to a flood of complaints , @entity2 trended on @entity26 and @entity27 was inundated with angry calls and emails and eventually backtracked			1
although it only lasted 24 hours , the ban got enough worldwide attention to see thousands of donations flooding in to @entity2 's @entity33 site , which she set up to raise money for @entity35 , a charity which runs school feeding projects in communities around the world			1
good cause : @entity2 's blog , @entity11 , has raised more than £ 60,000 since she first started it donations to the page have now hit £ 100,000 , which will see about 9,400 children receive a daily meal			1
@entity2 said : ' this is totally awesome and will help so many hungry children			2
' @entity35 is a very simple charity and it can achieve so much with so little as it costs just six pence to provide one meal			0
' that meal can make a big difference			0
i 've been told children receiving @entity35 have to walk two hours to get to their school every day - i could n't walk that far every day			1
@entity2 has already raised enough money to build a kitchen shelter and feed an entire school for a year at @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 , as part of @entity63 initiative			1
mega-bite : the schoolgirl posted a photograph of one pathetic offering online as part of a writing project she and her father started back for more : the council had tried to shut the blog down before a @entity26 bakclash forced a u-turn the nine - year - old is planning to celebrate the £ 100,000 milestone with a ' porridge party ' re-creating likuni phala , the porridge - like dish which her money will help feed the children of @entity60			1
the family is also planning to visit @entity60 later in the year where they will visit @entity58 and put the finishing touches on the sign for the school kitchen - named " @entity88 " - that will be built by @entity35			2
@entity2 , who may also visit a class at the school and do a few lessons , has already received a message of thanks from pupils at @entity97			1
in recognition of the schoolgirl and her supporters , they wrote : ' thank you @entity2 ' on their blackboard and sang songs			2
food for thought : @entity2 posted this picture on an internet blog and began to add daily snaps of her lunches , rating and commenting on them @entity113 grub : @entity2 's photos of her school dinner has turned her into an overnight internet sensation @entity2 's miserable school dinners look set to spark an outcry over nutrition for the nation 's children @entity35 , founder and chief executive of @entity35 , said he was humbled by the money raised through @entity2 's blog			1
he said : ' this is incredible and i ca n't thank @entity2 and her supporters enough for everything they have done			2
' as a result of their amazing beautiful acts of kindness , the lives of thousands of the world 's poorest children will be transformed			0
' instead of being hungry and working for their next meal , these children receiving @entity35 will be sitting in a classroom with a full stomach , learning how to read and write			0
' for every £ 10.70 donated , we are able to ensure another child will get a good daily meal for a whole school year and a brighter future			2
' one of the young blogger 's fans , celebrity chef @entity5 added : ' the real triumph must be to have raised so much money for @entity35 , this charity which provides nutritious meals for seriously deprived areas of the world			2
' the charity success comes less than a week after officials at @entity27 council ordered teachers to stop her from photographing her dinners and rating them online			1
victory ! @entity2 , 9 , and her father @entity162 were all smiles after the council 's decision to make a u-turn on banning her food blog in a post headed ‘ goodbye , ’ she wrote : ‘ this morning in maths i got taken out of class by my head teacher and taken to her office			1
‘ i was told that i could not take any more photos of my school dinners			2
’ but the officials seriously underestimated the youngster ’s internet following and thousands of people , led by celebrity chef @entity4 , took to @entity26 to criticise their decision , leading to a humiliating u-turn by the council			0
within hours of @entity4 tweeting to @entity2 to ‘ stay strong ’ and urging his 2.3million followers to re-post his message , the schoolgirl ’s blog became one of the top subjects discussed on the site worldwide			1
critics lined up to accuse the council of ‘ bullying ’ @entity2 by trying to ‘ silence her freedom of expression ’ and thousands signed a petition to get them to overturn the ban			2
and now @entity198 has stepped in to offer his support			0
his restaurant @entity200 won a @entity203 star in 1991 , making him the youngest @entity7 chef to win a star he went on to cook a main course of @entity207 for @entity208 and 250 guests at the @entity210 for her official 80th birthday celebration			0
he will also be known to many as a regular chef on @entity214			0
the decision also angered @entity7 education secretary @entity6 , whose intervention forced the council to perform a u-turn			0
council leader @entity219 announced they would be withdrawing the ban with immediate effect			0
he said : ‘ it ’s a good thing to do , to change your mind , and i ’ve certainly done that			0
’ @entity2 ’s father , @entity227 , 39 , said common sense had prevailed			1
‘ @entity2 is beaming , ’ he said			2
‘ she came home from school with a big smile on her face			0
‘ she is delighted she can carry on blogging , but more so about the money being raised for the charity			2
people have been very , very generous			0
the way the world reacted to the ban is very revealing , it ’s just fantastic that common sense has prevailed			0
’ the saga began seven weeks ago when @entity2 , with permission from teachers at @entity244 , started taking pictures of her £ 2 school dinners and commenting on them as part of a writing project			1
because @entity2 ’s home is on the west coast of @entity7 , however , standards for school meals differ and widespread improvements in the rest of @entity256 appear not to have been applied			1
her first post included a photo of a measly slice of pizza and a lonely potato croquette , alongside a sprinkling of sweetcorn , a cupcake for dessert and a lot of empty space			0
alongside the photo , the schoolgirl wrote : ‘ the pizza in the first pic was alright but i ’d have enjoyed more than one croquette			0
i ’m a growing kid and i need to concentrate all afternoon and i ca n’t do it on one croquette			0
do any of you think you could ? ’ @entity276 hit : @entity2 's fearless exposé of daily fare at her ( unnamed ) school prompted global discussion about shockingly unhealthy food being served beside a photograph of a limp looking cheeseburger , two potato croquets , a few rings of cucumber and a rocket ice lolly , @entity2 wrote : ‘ today ’s meal was on the menu as @entity291 and ice cream / biscuit but as you can see i got an ice lolly			1
i wish they had stuck to the menu			0
’ over the next two months her daily snaps gathered an impressive following , with more than two million people throughout the world logging on and sending in their own pictures for her site			0
after seeing the photographs , @entity4 , a veteran school food campaigner , sent a tweet to her father , which read : ‘ shocking but inspirational blog			1
big love from @entity311 ’ @entity2 later posted that the celebrity chef had sent her a copy of his @entity4 ’s @entity256 cookbook in which he wrote : ‘ @entity315 , great work ! ! ! clever girl			2
@entity319 keep it up ! ! ’ but last week , @entity2 , whose mother is a gp , revealed that teachers wanted her to stop taking the photographs			1
the council said the decision was made after an article published in a tabloid newspaper , under the headline ‘ time to fire the dinner ladies ’ , left some members of staff at the school in tears			0
in an ill - judged 500 - plus word statement , they accused @entity2 ’s blog of being ‘ misleading ’ and attacked her father for refusing to put an end to it			1
mr @entity227 , who runs a smallholding , correctly predicted the move was an ‘ own goal ’ which would serve only to generate more criticism because ‘ the pictures tell the story about how good the food is ’			0
@entity2 's @entity11 blog has chalked up a million hits			1
she is supervised by her father @entity162 ( left )			0
