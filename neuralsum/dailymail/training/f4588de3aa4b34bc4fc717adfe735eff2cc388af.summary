by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 03:12 est , 1 november 2013 gravity pulling down the skin of the scalp is to blame for baldness , an expert has claimed from poor genes to hormone problems , there are many reasons why a man can go bald			1
and now one expert has come up with a somewhat novel theory - gravity			0
dr @entity13 , a plastic surgeon in @entity14 , @entity15 , believes gravity pulling down the skin of the scalp is to blame			1
the vast majority of men suffer from male pattern baldness and dr @entity13 believes his theory is ' unparallelled ' in its ability to explain this type of hair loss			2
the answer , he says , is the weight of the scalp on the hair follicles			0
in younger men , the scalp has sufficient fat tissue under the skin , and it is ' capable of keeping itself well - hydrated , ' taking the pressure off the hair follicles			1
but as a man ages , the skin and underlying fat become thinner , and the pressure on the hair follicles increases			1
declining levels of the male sex hormone testosterone contribute to thinning of this fat , dr @entity13 explained			2
as the amount of cushioning fat decreases , the hair follicle has to work harder against all the pressure - and needs more of the hormone for normal growth			0
to respond to this , a potent form of the male sex hormone testosterone , called dihydrotestosterone ( @entity54 ) , builds up in the scalp			0
the hair growth cycle accelerates in response to @entity54 , but it 's not enough to overcome the increased pressure			0
over time , the hair follicle becomes smaller and smaller , resulting in progressively increasing hair loss			0
but it is a vicious circle - because higher dht levels also cause fat to melt away , he added			0
if the pressure created by the weight of the scalp is the cause of balding , then hair loss should occur at the top of the head - ' and this is exactly what happens in male pattern baldness ' , dr @entity13 points out			1
hair loss patterns are affected by differences in the shape of the head , reflecting variations in scalp pressure			2
for example , the ears help resist the effects of gravity on the scalp , lessening hair loss on the sides of the head he believes that individual hair loss patterns are affected by differences in the shape of the head , reflecting variations in scalp pressure			1
the weight of the facial soft tissues adds to the pressure at the front of the scalp , contributing to hair loss there			2
in contrast , the ears help resist the effects of gravity on the scalp , lessening hair loss on the sides of the head			1
the research is published in the journal @entity104 .			0
