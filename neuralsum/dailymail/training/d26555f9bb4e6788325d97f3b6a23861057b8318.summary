@entity0 beats @entity1 6 - 1 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 on opening day of @entity3 final between @entity4 and @entity5 @entity6 will decide if he can put his ailing body through one last test this year to try to salvage his @entity3 dream			1
the world no 2 was hampered by stiffness in his back while being trounced by a highly charged @entity13 as @entity5 levelled their final against @entity4			1
yet @entity6 remained upbeat as he contemplated whether he could play in today ’s pivotal doubles rubber alongside @entity0 , very much his foe in @entity18 last week but now his key ally			2
‘ it just takes a while for it to leave your mind			0
it ’s like a ghost			0
’ it could require him to play three matches in as many days if he is to win the one prize in tennis that has eluded him			0
it really was a case of changing places from that fretful night a week ago at the @entity46 , where @entity6 edged out his compatriot @entity0 amid the controversies of the heckling from his wife @entity50 , who was nowhere to be seen			2
@entity5 cult hero @entity13 produced a stunning performance against @entity6 in @entity52 there was a world record crowd of 27,432 at the @entity57 @entity56 , home of @entity59 side @entity52 @entity6 look dejected during the match and was unable to stop the unpredictable @entity5 the defeat comes less than a week after the controversy surrounding @entity6 and team - mate @entity0 @entity13 celebrates wildly during the match after winning a point against @entity6 @entity13 gives a thumbs - up to the crowd in @entity52 after his surprise straight - sets victory with his slightly awkward movement to the backhand side @entity6 looked like he was still paying a price for all the exertion in @entity18 , and that only added to the resolve that the unpredictable @entity13 drew upon			1
playing to a gallery of 27,432 fans , @entity13 was gloriously assertive from the start and continually pushed back a subdued @entity6 , who looked as though he would rather have been anywhere else			2
faced with such animalistic aggression and struggling to adapt to the indoor clay court , @entity6 was unrecognisable from the man who rolled over @entity80 barely a week ago			0
@entity0 defeated @entity1 in four sets to give @entity4 a 1 - 0 lead in the @entity3 @entity0 is hoping to create history for @entity4 by helping them win their maiden @entity3 @entity5 no 1 tsonga proved more inconsistent throughout the match against @entity0 @entity0 , by contrast , had produced the best response possible to a week when he suffered bitter disappointment and had his fortitude questioned into the bargain			1
cry baby ? not on this evidence , as he beat @entity1 6 - 1 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 in two hours and 24 minutes			1
thousands of @entity4 fans have swollen the head count to the highest in history for an official tennis match and @entity0 seemed galvanised by the experience			0
the one period when he slipped was in the second set and , while it may have been coincidence , he dropped three straight games after someone called out ‘ cry baby , cry ! ’ between his first and second serves in the third game			0
@entity1 is looking to help @entity5 win their 10th @entity3 title and first since 2001 the match was @entity0 's first since his much - publicised spat with @entity6 at @entity111			1

@entity6 was beaten in straight sets by @entity13 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 3
the @entity3 is the one blank on @entity6 's formidable cv
