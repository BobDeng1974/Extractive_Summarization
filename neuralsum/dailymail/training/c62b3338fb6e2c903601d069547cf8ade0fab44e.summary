by @entity1 reporter published : 11:12 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 12:13 est , 1 august 2012 an @entity3 coach who helped to bring the @entity5 ' sailing events to @entity6 was crushed to death in an avalanche while skiing , an inquest heard today			1
@entity11 had been out on the slopes with wife @entity13 and a group of friends when the couple were engulfed in the torrent of snow			1
his chest was crushed by the impact of the thick snow piling on top of him and he was trapped , unconscious , while his friends and rescuers desperately tried to find him			2
accidental death : @entity11 was caught in an avalanche while skiiing in @entity28 the 67 - year - old father of two , who once coached @entity31 ’s sailing team , was eventually found and taken to hospital but died the following day			1
speaking at the conclusion of the inquest into her husband ’s death today , ms @entity13 , said that she had been ' spooked ' that the hearing had taken place in the midst of the @entity3 sailing competition			1
mr @entity11 had put forward @entity6 , @entity42 , as a venue for the games			1
' it ’s quite poignant this , that the inquest , was done in the middle of the @entity3 , ' she said			1
' he was an ex-olympic sailing coach and it was his idea that they had the sailing at @entity6 when he was the @entity3 coach in 1970			1
' he would have been absolutely over the moon that they have held the sailing there			2
he loved the mountains and the sea : mr @entity11 had been @entity3 sailing coach preparing @entity57 for the ' 72 games in @entity59 ' he had registered to be a volunteer at the @entity61 and he had suggested that @entity6 would have been a great venue			1
' ms @entity13 said that her husband had been appointed as one of sailing ’s first @entity3 coaches in 1970 in preparation for the 1972 games in @entity59			1
' he had such a love of life , he had so much charisma , ' she added			2
' he used to say that the best things in life were the sea and the mountains , it ’s a shame that it was one of those loves that took him from us so soon			0
' however , he would not have wanted it any other way			0
' as keen skiiers , mr @entity11 and ms @entity13 , from the @entity84 , @entity85 , were frequent visitors to the @entity88 ski resort of @entity28 and had been staying there over @entity89 in 2010			1
on @entity93 they and a group of friends had gone out for an ' off piste ' trek on the @entity97 slope , aided by professional instructor @entity98			0
the inquest at @entity100 , @entity101 , was told that all of them were experienced skiiers but would always go out with mr @entity98 , a friend of the couple , for safety reasons			2
the group had been out at around 8.30am , the morning after snow had fallen in the area - where the risk of an avalanche was relatively low			0
as part of a further attempt to stay safe they were told to stay around 50ft apart , and ms @entity13 said that each skiier would wait until the one in front of them had cleared the section before setting off			0
however , one skiier was believed to have stopped unexpectedly - leading @entity121 investigators to suspect that the snow mantle had become overloaded , causing the avalanche			0
ms @entity13 said that she had been standing on the slope when she heard a ' woomph ' noise and saw cracks appearing in the snow beneath her			0
' the whole thing started to go sideways , i was thinking about what was happening to me , ' she said , explaining that she had not seen her husband			0
' when i started to go sideways i was on my own there with the snow starting to move , that ’s when i thought maybe i should pull my handle			0
' off - piste : the mountains in @entity28 , @entity121 , where mr @entity11 met his tragic end each skiier in the group was wearing a backpack with an emergency air bag they could deploy to prevent them from being trapped under the snow			1
ms @entity13 said she had struggled to inflate her air bags , and was only able to do so once she had already fallen into the snow			0
' i was face down in the snow , it was only when i heard the charge go off that i knew the balloons had inflated , ' she said			0
despite not inflating fully , the bright orange balloons still made her easy for rescuers to spot - unlike mr @entity11 , who was unable to deploy his			1
the inquest heard that it took rescuers around 20 minutes to find him , trapped under one metre of snow and having suffered a cardio - respiratory arrest			2
he was taken to hospital in nearby @entity159 but died the following day			0
' he would have been absolutely over the moon ' : finn class sailors @entity162 of @entity31 , left , and @entity163 of @entity164 compete in the @entity5 at @entity6 a post-mortem examination revealed that his cause of death had been fractured ribs and trauma to the chest , although he also had bruises to his head			2
@entity173 , coroner for @entity101 , said that he was in no doubt that mr @entity11 was an experienced skiier and that all safety precautions necessary had been taken			1
' it ’s fair to say that avalanches can be caused by many factors , it was probably as a result of the skiiers on the slope in the area at the same time , ' he said			0
' that is an inherent risk of skiing			0
' the avalanche started and although ms @entity13 was able to inflate her air bag i do n’t think that mr @entity11 had a chance to do so because it happened so quickly			2
' recording a verdict of accidental death , mr @entity173 told ms @entity13 that she had been lucky to escape unharmed from the avalanche			1
' so much in these events is an element of chance and he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time			0

@entity11 , who was @entity3 sailing coach in 1970 , had suggested the *seaside* town as a ' great venue ' for the event
he had put his name down to be a volunteer at the 2012 games
