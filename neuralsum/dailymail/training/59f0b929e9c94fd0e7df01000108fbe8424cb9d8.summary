scientists in @entity1 have created nearly 600 exact genetic copies of one mouse after 25 rounds of cloning			1
the perfectly cloned mice could pave the way for milk and meat from ' super ' animals created in the lab , scientists say			1
experts successfully cloned the successive generations of mice using the same techniques used to create @entity16 the sheep			1
attack of the clones : scientists in @entity1 have created nearly 600 cloned mice after 25 rounds of cloning the rodents live a normal lifespan and the process can be carried on indefinitely through successive generations			1
the cloned mice showed no signs of growing old prematurely and appeared mentally and physically perfect			1
dr @entity27 said : ' this technique could be very useful for the large scale production of superior quality animals , for farming or conservation purposes			0
' in an experiment that began eight years ago , the researchers used ' somatic cell nuclear transfer ' ( @entity36 ) to produce almost six hundred mice from one original ' donor ' after twenty five consecutive rounds of cloning			1
the technique shot to fame in 1997 when @entity16 the sheep , the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell , was unveiled to the world			1
scientific breakthrough : experts successfully cloned the successive generations of mice using the same techniques used to create @entity16 ( pictured ) it creates an embryo by taking the nucleus , which houses the genetic material of a cell , from one cell and putting it into an unfertilised egg that has had its own genetic material removed			1
the resulting embryo is then an exact genetic copy of the cell from the animal or person that donated the nucleus			0
it has been used successfully in laboratory and farm animals but , until now , scientists had not overcome the limitations of low success rates and the few times mammals could be recloned			2
attempts at recloning cats , pigs and mice more than two to six times had failed			2
dr @entity27 , of the @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity1 , said : ' one possible explanation for this limit on the number of recloning attempts is an accumulation of genetic or epigenetic abnormalities over successive generations			0
' an animal inherits its genetic code from its parents along with the machinery for unlocking it , a process known as epigenetics			0
the epigenetic changes in the cell control what parts of its dna are expressed and how			0
it is the method by which a liver or skin cell knows its specific function because of the genes that are switched on or off			0
so to prevent these potentially devastating alterations the researchers added a naturally occurring chemical called trichostatin			0
this increased cloning efficiency up to sixfold , according to the findings published in the journal @entity109			0
by improving each step of the procedure , they were able to clone the mice repeatedly without seeing a reduction in the success rate			2
the 581 healthy mice obtained in this way were all fertile , gave birth to healthy pups and lived for about two years , similar to mice conceived in the normal way			2
the researchers said : ' our results show there were no accumulations of epigenetic or genetic abnormalities in the mice , even after repeated cloning			2
' dr @entity27 's work hit the headlines in 2008 when his team created clones from the bodies of mice that had been frozen for sixteen years , again using @entity36 .			0

scientists used the same techniques to create @entity16 the sheep
the cloned mice appeared mentally and physically perfect
