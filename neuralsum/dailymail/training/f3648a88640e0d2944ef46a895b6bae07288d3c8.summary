by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 12:18 est , 11 june 2013 the origins of the iconic royal yacht @entity3 have been laid bare after the release of the original sketches for the design of the ship 's interior			1
60 years after her launch , drawings of @entity3 's state rooms by architect sir @entity11 have been handed over to a trust by his daughter			1
the renowned designer was appointed by the @entity17 and the @entity18 , who welcomed the opportunity to put their own stamp on the yacht to mark the beginning of a new era			1
designs : these sketches by sir @entity11 depict the original plans for the royal yacht britannia ; this is the @entity17 's personal study on board the vessel collection : the architect 's daughter has given the drawings , such as this one which also shows the @entity17 's study , to the @entity40 unchanged : as this photograph of the @entity17 's study shows , the designs remain largely intact @entity3 was launched in 1953 , two months before @entity17 's coronation , and clocked up more than one million miles until she was decommissioned in 1997			1
sir @entity11 was commissioned to put forward ideas after the royal couple rejected the designs put forward by the yacht ’s builders			1
they wanted the ship to be a ' home from home ' whose contemporary style would be a contrast to their ornate palaces			0
among the rooms kitted out by sir @entity11 were the @entity17 's study , the sun room and the grand staircase - and the designs have remained unchanced for six decades since			1
he had been selected for the job after impressing the @entity18 in his role as the director of architecture at the @entity69 in 1948			2
relaxed : rooms like the main drawing room were meant to be much more laid - back than the royal palaces classic design : sir @entity11 's vision for the main drawing room and other areas of the ship were forward - thinking intimate : this drawing shows the design for prince @entity18 's bedroom on board the royal yacht domestic : the @entity18 's bedroom on @entity3 , which was decommissioned in 1997 his daughter , @entity85 , has now presented the 10 photographic slides of the sketches to the @entity40 for the first time			1
mrs @entity85 said : ' when @entity3 was commissioned the yacht ’s builders had presented to the @entity17 their ideas for the interior of the yacht in the style of an @entity97 liner			1
' @entity98 , a @entity100 man , did n’t want that			0
he said he wanted something simple			0
' my father had been director of architecture and really the impresario at the @entity69			0
because the @entity18 was so interested in anything that was progressive and new he thought father would be the perfect person to consult			2
@entity110 room and bar : the royal couple were said to love spending time on board @entity3 leisure space : the sun room and bar area as they appear now on the yacht , which is moored in the @entity119 office : prince @entity18 's study , which he commissioned personally from sir @entity11 room : the @entity18 's study today , 16 years after @entity3 left active service ' @entity3 was the first opportunity for the newly crowned @entity17 and her husband to make something of their own , to their own taste			1
' @entity3 was n’t inherited - it was something they could put their own stamp on			2
it was a floating palace so it needed to be quite formal , but it was also very relaxed			0
' @entity17 and the @entity18 were were young at the time and they did n’t want @entity139 interiors like at @entity140			2
they wanted something that was n’t too elaborate			0
' my father understood what they wanted , and the fact that the rooms have not been changed in 60 years is testament to his designs			2
' they were contemporary designs that have stood the test of time			0
the yacht is like a time capsule			0
' iconic : the grand staircase , which was designed by sir @entity11 in a contemporary 1950s style out of use : @entity3 now stands decommissioned in @entity160 , on the @entity119 @entity161 , chief executive of the @entity3 , said : ' the sketches are a fantastic and fascinating piece of @entity3 ’s history			1
' we are very grateful to have received them and to be able to show them off to our visitors			0
' sir @entity11 went on to form a close friendship with the @entity170 , designing interiors at @entity172 and @entity140			1
he also enjoyed several trips on @entity3 as a guest of the @entity175			2
@entity3 was launched at @entity177 ’s @entity176 in @entity178 on april 16 , 1953 , two months before the @entity17 ’s coronation and the conquering of @entity181			1
on royal tours the 410ft yacht boasted a crew of 220 yachtsmen , 21 officers , three season officers and a 26 - strong @entity189 band			0
she was decommissioned in @entity190 on december 11 , 1997 , after 44 years in service , an occasion which is said to have brought tears to the @entity17 's eyes			0
