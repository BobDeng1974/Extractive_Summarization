by @entity0 published : 21:24 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 03:35 est , 5 december 2013 well - paid @entity5 stars should stop criticising the corporation in public and get on with their jobs , one of its top directors said last night			2
in a thinly - veiled broadside at some of the @entity5 ’s top talent - including @entity12 and actress @entity13 - the corporation 's director of television @entity15 said staff who go public with their concerns undermine morale			1
speaking at a press launch of the @entity5 ’s @entity24 schedule , he said : ‘ i ’m finding a little too often that people who work for the @entity5 and are well rewarded for it are quick to attack or criticise the organisation in public rather than deal with any issues or concerns internally			2
well - paid @entity5 stars should stop criticising the corporation in public and get on with their jobs , @entity15 , one of its top directors said last night ‘ the @entity5 is an imperfect institution and ‘ critical friends ’ are an important way for us to keep improving			2
we must never be immune to criticism or unwilling to learn from others			0
‘ but i know that @entity5 staff often wonder why some of our on - screen talent and some former members of staff choose to attack or undermine the @entity5 in public rather than express any concerns they have in private conversations within the @entity5			1
in short , this drives @entity5 staff mad			0
’ although mr @entity15 refused to give names , @entity5 insiders said he was particularly incensed by a recent interview given by mr @entity12 , 75 , as well as comments by absolutely fabulous star @entity52 and former head of tv news @entity54			1
last month , mr @entity12 - who has been at the corporation for more than 50 years – publicly accused the @entity5 being ‘ too big for its own good ’ and criticised its ‘ terrible ’ coverage of last year ’s @entity60 river pageant			1
it followed an outspoken attack by @entity52 in a magazine interview , in which she said the @entity5 ’s management was ‘ top heavy ’ , and a devastating critique by mr @entity54 in a leader column for the @entity71 newspaper			0
the former executive accused the @entity5 of being too big and too left wing , and suggested the licence fee should be shared with rivals and the number of tv channels reduced			0
but instead of welcoming their contributions to the debate over @entity5 management , mr @entity15 accused them of damaging the corporation			1
in a thinly - veiled broadside at some of the @entity5 's top talent - including @entity12 and actress @entity13 - mr @entity15 said staff who go public with their concerns undermine morale he said : ‘ i would also like to call on those who are paid by the @entity5 but criticise it in media interviews and in public to think hard before they join the daily chorus of @entity5 - bashing that takes place in some quarters			1
‘ it is damaging to an institution that i ’m convinced they love and would not actually want to harm			0
‘ from now , i ’d like to call on everyone who believes in the @entity5 to get behind it , to speak up for it , to celebrate its successes and help us explain why the @entity5 really matters and sits proudly at the heart of public service broadcasting and @entity109 ’s creative industries - rather than find ways to undermine it			2
’ last month , mr @entity12 - who has been at the corporation for more than 50 years - publicly accused the @entity5 being ' too big for its own good ' he added : ‘ when problems do arise , let ’s deal with them in the most effective way we can and instead use the privileged platform enjoyed by those in public life to highlight the unique attractions of the @entity5 and help ensure it is as healthy , vibrant , impactful and creative in its 2022 centenary year as it has ever been			1
’ speaking to the @entity125 after his public speech , mr @entity15 denied he wanted to clamp down on free speech by preventing whistleblowers from speaking out			1
he said : ‘ we welcome public debate about the @entity5			0
‘ but those who work for us , and who are well paid for doing so , should come to their managers with their concerns			0
‘ we should be working to make the @entity5 better , rather than attacking it			0
