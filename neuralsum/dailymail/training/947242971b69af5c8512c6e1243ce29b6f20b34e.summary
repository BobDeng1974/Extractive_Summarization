@entity0 has labelled @entity2 's accusation that the batsman was not interested during the @entity4 as ' untrue '			1
@entity2 , the new managing director of the @entity5 , told @entity7 's @entity6 that he had never seen any player ' as disinterested or distracted on a cricket field ' as @entity0 was during the disastrous winter series and said he could not find ' one supporter ' of the batsman among the staff			2
however , the 33 - year - old , who was sacked by @entity15 earlier this year , retorted on his website : ' the suggestion that i was uninterested during the winter ashes series against @entity20 is wholly untrue			2
hitting back : @entity0 rejected @entity2 's claims made on @entity6 hitting out : @entity0 was criticised for his ' irresponsible ' batting style during the @entity4 series in @entity20 ' although i was having injections in my knee , which inhibited my mobility and thus my ability to field close to the wicket , i was fully motivated to play for @entity15 and whilst i accept that the series as a whole fell well below my own personal standards , i finished the series as the top scorer			1
' i did , and continue to have a good relationship with most of the @entity15 players , which has been subsequently highlighted by a number of press interviews '			1
tough talking : @entity5 managing director @entity2 ( left ) and @entity7 test match special commentator @entity39 ( right ) outcast : @entity15 coach @entity41 could not find any support among senior players for @entity0 @entity2 also attacked @entity0 's batting style , which he called ' frustrating ' and implied was irresponsible			2
to that , @entity0 responded : ' with regard to the criticisms aimed at my “ the way i play type attitude ” , i feel it ’s only reasonable to remind mr @entity2 that this method has brought me over 13,500 runs for @entity15 , in addition to being part of four @entity4 - winning teams and a @entity57 - winning side , all of which achievements i am hugely proud of			1
' @entity0 says this statement does not breach his confidentiality agreement as he had a right to reply			0
whilst i have always abided by the confidentiality clauses that the @entity5 were insistent on imposing in the settlement agreement i entered into with them at the time of the termination of my central contract , i feel it only fair to exercise my right to reply to the comments made by @entity2 in an interview that took place on @entity6 during yesterday ’s @entity74			2
aside from the strange timing of yesterday ’s interview during an odi , the comments regarding the cancellation of my contract should be put in perspective			0
it was made very clear to me that i was not being selected for the @entity57 squad , and the @entity5 did not try to give me the remotest confidence that i would be seriously considered for selection for @entity15 again			0
had i allowed my contract to “ wind down ” , as the @entity5 proposed , i would not only have forfeited the performance - related elements that are part of the @entity15 player remuneration , but more importantly my availability as a professional cricketer would have remained under the control of the @entity5 for a further eight months			0
the suggestion that i was uninterested during the winter ashes series against @entity20 is wholly untrue			0
although i was having injections in my knee , which inhibited my mobility and thus my ability to field close to the wicket , i was fully motivated to play for @entity15 and whilst i accept that the series as a whole fell well below my own personal standards , i finished the series as the top scorer			0

i will continue to abide by the confidentiality provisions contained in my settlement agreement , which i believe applies to both the @entity5 and myself			0
