everywhere you go on the @entity1 , you 'll see @entity1 flags - three conjoined white legs on a red background			1
for the @entity1 , the @entity8 is a powerful symbol of independent spirit and endurance , the motto being : ' whichever way you throw , it will stand			1
' lately , it 's become a symbol for me too , of three islands			0
there 's the island i 've called home for the past 11 years , the island i write about in my novels , and somewhere in between , perhaps , a deeper truth about this beautiful rock in the middle of the @entity22			2
independent spirit : the harbour at @entity25 , the @entity1 's second biggest town legend : a carving of the sea god @entity29 can a place with a reputation for being safe and sleepy really also be home to spies , killers and evil spirits that feature in my books ? i like to think so , and here are a few reasons why			1
the weather might be mixed but the landscape is dramatic , whether seen from the sea , walking the coast path , or taking the electric railway to the top of the island 's solitary mountain , @entity51 ( from where , on a clear day , you can see the distant humped blurs of @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 )			2
the rich variety of locations is something i 've grown to appreciate in my books , and something the @entity1 film industry has thrived on during the past decade			1
need a spooky cottage ? the island has plenty			2
the same goes for lush glens and lonely coves			0
but the island provides more than great backdrops			2
it 's compact , with a population in the region of 85,000 , and while that makes it ideally manageable for a weekend visit , it also fosters something all writers rely on - rumours and hearsay			0
my first @entity1 - set thriller , @entity82 , grew out of a rumour i heard almost as soon as i moved here - namely , that it 's used as a place to relocate people enrolled in @entity89 witness protection schemes			1
is the rumour true ? i do n't know for certain , but it seems credible to me			0
the island is isolated and has lots of out - of - the - way spots			0
the @entity1 also its own very distinct identity			1
where else could the population swell for a fortnight every june in celebration of a controversial motorbike festival that pits man against machine over a course run on almost 38 miles of public roads ? the @entity1 is isolated , with some out of the way spots , lush glens and lonely coves racing glory : every summer the island hosts the world - famous @entity112 races , with motorbikes reaching 200mph the @entity112 ( @entity112 ) races have been in existence since 1907 , with recent competitors recording top speeds of 200mph			1
but while most islanders are proud of the long tradition of racing greats who have tamed the course , the event is not without its critics			0
like many others , i find it hard to reconcile the number of fatalities that have occurred with the racing glory , but i ca n't fail to admire how brave the riders must be			0
another local oddity is hop - tunaa - the @entity1 's version of @entity136			1
taking place every october 31 , it shares many similarities with @entity136 , but is still marked by some unique @entity1 twists			1
for example , hop - tu - naa traditionalists carve lanterns from turnips instead of pumpkins , and children call from door - to - door singing nonsense songs instead of trick - or - treating			0
in fact , one of the songs was striking enough to become the basis for my new thriller , @entity156			0
it 's a short step from rumours and hearsay to myths and legends , and the @entity1 has some of the most interesting i 've ever heard : from the sea god , @entity29 , who cloaks the isle in a veil of mist to protect it from outside threats , to the @entity169 , a big black hound that haunts @entity171			1
do n't believe me ? why not come to visit and experience it all for yourself ? @entity175 steam - packet.com 01624 661661 offers crossings from @entity177 and @entity178 to @entity179			0
one - way fares start at Â£ 62 for a car and two passengers			0
