by @entity1 reporter published : 19:12 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 18 august 2013 the weather over the past year has created the ideal conditions for a tasty , bumper apple crop , experts have said			2
last year 's wet autumn , followed by the icy spring and a hot summer have been perfect for apple growing , and this year 's crop is set to be sweeter and rosier than apples seen in recent harvest , the @entity6 said			1
the cool , wet spring and summer last year meant apple orchards saw a bad harvest , which could have contributed to the good crop this year as trees often compensate for a poor season by growing extra fruit the following year			1
while the wet autumn in 2012 was bad for last year 's harvest , it was good news for this year , because it ruled out the chance of drought which can lead to small , poor tasting fruits			1
this year 's weather has also been very good for apple trees , with the prolonged cold snap early on helping them fruit , and the sunny summer enabling them to grow and develop a good flavour , @entity6 experts said			1
@entity40 , @entity6 fruit specialist at the society 's @entity42 garden in @entity44 , said : ' apples evolved in central @entity46 to suit a continental climate of hot summers and very cold winters and need to be exposed to a certain amount of cold weather each winter or they wo n't flower or fruit properly			2
' he said most apple varieties need a minimum of 1,000 hours below @entity57 , and those kind of chilly conditions remained well into april , giving the trees enough ' chill time ' for the fruit to set properly			1
@entity40 , pictured , the @entity6 's fruit specialist in @entity44 , said apples need to be exposed to a certain amount of cold weather each winter or they wo n't flower or fruit properly ' the long extended period of cold also stopped the trees from flowering at their usual time			2
by the time they did flower , there were more daylight hours and the weather was warmer that it would be if they had flowered as usual			0
' this meant a lower risk of damage by frost and more insects around to pollinate the blossom			0
and when summer finally arrived , the warm , sunny conditions boosted ripening of apples			0
mr @entity40 said : ' like all fruits , apples need sunshine if they are going to grow and develop a good flavour			0
in the spring crops were lagging up to a month behind but a sudden burst of sunshine in prime ripening season late june and july , has helped the apples gain some ground as well as helping them ripen up beautifully			0
' this year 's crop should have an excellent flavour			1
' the variety of temperature this year , some of it on a daily basis with cooler nights causing heavy dew before giving way to hot days , has also affected the apples , giving them a ' nice rosy blush ' , he added			0
the @entity6 predicted the home - grown harvest would start flooding into shops in the next few weeks , giving lovers of @entity112 varieties a real treat			2
the horticultural organisation also said the four @entity6 gardens round the country would be celebrating all things apple with tastings , tips and cookery demonstrations at their taste of autumn festivals , taking place at @entity42 on october 16 - 20 and the other gardens october 12 - 13 .			0
