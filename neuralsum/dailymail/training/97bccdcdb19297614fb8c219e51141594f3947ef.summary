scientists claim to have to found an effective method for tackling the age - old school nightmare of ' mean girls ' behavior			1
according to researchers at the @entity6 , ' relational aggression ' - forms of non-physical bullying such as gossiping , rumor spreading , exclusion and rejection - can be reduced using an intervention strategy they 've dubbed @entity14 ( @entity15 )			1
tested on 30 girls aged between 12 and 15 , the ten - week program involved group counseling , role - playing , journaling and weekly goal setting , and was found overall to decrease relational aggression			1
in addition , the girls ' caregivers attended separate workshops and bi-weekly phone consultations during which they were taught better monitoring and supervision skills			2
a range of ' appropriate disciplinary responses ' for dealing with mean girl-esque behavior were also suggested			0
according to @entity53 , co-author of the study and assistant professor in the @entity56 at the university , parents and teachers should keep their eyes open for relational aggression , so they do nâ€™t ' unknowingly contribute to the negative behaviors			0
' statistically , teenage boys are twice as likely to bully as teenage girls , or at least twice as likely to be reported for bullying			2
it is widely speculated , however , that boys , who tend to be more overt and physical in their approach , are simply more easily detected than ' mean girls ' who display relational aggression			0
' this study represents a first step in helping school personnel meet the intervention needs of a diverse group of relationally aggressive girls , ' dr @entity53 said			2
co-author @entity76 , also an assistant professor , added : ' good outcomes can happen when priorities are set by schools and families to prevent and eliminate relational aggression			0
' indeed , according to the @entity85 @entity84 , bullying stops in ten seconds , 57per cent of the time , when an adult or fellow student immediately intervenes			0
researchers at the @entity6 now hope to expand the @entity15 program into more schools in a bid to manage what is a pretty universal , if sometimes overlooked , part of the nature of teenage girls .			1
