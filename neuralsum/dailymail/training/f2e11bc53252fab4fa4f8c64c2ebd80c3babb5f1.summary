@entity0 , 20 , is back in @entity14 's squad after recovering from a knee injury and is aiming to become a regular in time for @entity17			1
' to lift a trophy for @entity4 , ' he said			1
' to win something – because that 's what every player wants to do			1
it would be a dream come true if that happened			0
' @entity0 , who has won nine caps already , maintained he is keeping a level head despite praise from the likes of @entity42 maestro @entity41 , who said he could easily grace the @entity43 in future years			1
@entity18 , who like @entity0 burst onto the scene as a teenager at @entity6 , has been providing words of advice and encouragement – especially on how to cope with the pressures of high expectation			1
' he 's been helpful to me and the other youngsters like @entity53 ( @entity54 ) and @entity55 , ' said @entity0			1
' he 's always been there for a bit of guidance and to pass his experience on to us			2
he gives some good advice to us			0
@entity0 has praised the influence of captain @entity18 ( centre ) , who is set to win his 100th cap @entity0 , pictured against @entity65 at the @entity12 , is in his first @entity4 squad since the trip to @entity68 ' he 's just said he coped with ( the pressure ) easily , it just came naturally to him			1
that 's the way i look at it , i do n't want to get big - headed , i just take it as it comes			1
' there are still loads of pictures of @entity18 at the @entity78 , and memorabilia of him when he was at the club			0
there are clips of him down in the video room			0
' when i was younger i saw @entity18 breaking through at 16 , scoring cracking goals			0
then for him to go and make his @entity4 debut , while he was still at @entity6 , was good to see			1
he 's gone on and had a tremendous career and i 've always looked up to him			2
' i 've always had my feet on the ground and i 've never forgotten where i come from			0
it 's great be compared to @entity91 and the @entity92 of this world			2
but i 'm just focused on being myself and playing my own game and hopefully getting better			0

' i found the @entity12 experience really good for me , ' he added			2
' obviously we did n't do the best			0
but for me and the other younger lads it was good for us to get a game			0
hopefully in the future we will get plenty more @entity114 under our belt			0
' ' it 's really exciting because we 've got a good mixture of young lads and the experienced lads like @entity120 and @entity18 and @entity121			2
' at the moment i 've just got to try and get into the team and i 've got to do well with my club			2
i 've got to do everything right off the field and hopefully everything else will take care of itself			0
' illustrating his age when asked for his earliest @entity4 memory he said : ' it 's got to be that @entity2 free kick against @entity11			1
