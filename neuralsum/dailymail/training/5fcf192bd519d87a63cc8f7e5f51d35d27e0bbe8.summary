by @entity0 with their blonde good looks and strapping build , @entity2 men such as @entity4 star @entity3 , 43 , have long been considered among the most handsome in @entity7			1
but women do n't just want to date them : they want to have ' @entity10 babies ' too , with @entity2 sperm now accounting for a third of the total used by @entity15 fertility clinics			1
and the @entity15 is n't the only place where @entity2 sperm sales are booming - women from all over the world are choosing to go @entity20 when they need a sperm donor			1
in demand : more and more @entity15 women are giving birth to ' @entity10 babies ' helped by @entity2 sperm banks main attraction : like @entity3 , the @entity2 ' blonde good looks have proved popular ' i went to a conference where someone from the @entity33 showed a slide , ' chuckles @entity35 , who heads the @entity37 - based @entity36			1
' he said : " these are the main @entity2 export products - beer , @entity41 and sperm ! " ' so why are so many @entity15 women going @entity2 ? according to dr @entity44 , a fertility expert at the @entity45 , one of the reasons is a shortage of homegrown sperm			1
' we do n't have enough donors in the @entity15 to meet the national need , ' he explains			2
' we do n't have the clinic infrastructure sufficient to recruit enough donors - even when men want to donate			0
' often there simply is n't the size and scale within small @entity59 clinics to consider having a donor recruitment programme - plus if you 're not confident that sufficient men are going to ring up and become sperm donors , the economics of it simply are n't going to work			2
' the @entity59 is used to treating patients and you get a fee for treating patients			0
you do n't get a fee for screening a donor that you may not ultimately accept			0
' compounding the problem for @entity15 clinics is the 2005 law that forces men to waive their anonymity , meaning sperm donors face the prospect of offspring turning up on their doorstep once they reach the age of 18			1
nevertheless , although @entity2 clinics , among them the world 's largest sperm bank , @entity85 , can not sell semen from anonymous donors to @entity15 women , business is booming thanks to the huge numbers of local men happy to sign up anyway			1
looking good : @entity94 star @entity93 , 32 , has helped fuel @entity15 demand for half - @entity2 babies while controversies for @entity2 sperm banks are few and far between , one of the more amusing concerned a bumper crop of sperm sourced from red - headed men			1
when , in september 2011 , @entity37 's largest sperm bank @entity85 announced it had stopped accepting ginger sperm , the world 's flame - haired community was outraged			1
@entity108 then followed up with an unusual special offer for @entity111 parents - a 15 per cent discount for those who plumped for red			0
speaking to the @entity114 , director @entity113 said : ' we would be more than happy to supply to people in @entity111 who are looking for a child with red hair			0
' we currently have too many donors for the first time ever and i know red hair is particularly popular in places like @entity111 and @entity124			0
' we are always open to negotiation			0
@entity111 clinics could get a discount of five , 10 or 15 per cent			0
' ' my parents think its a bit weird , ' admits twenty - something donor @entity131 , who has waived his anonymity and is responsible for some of the sperm dispatched to @entity15 clinics			1
' my father has said a few times : " what am i going to do in 20 years when somebody comes knocking on my door and says @entity141 ! " ' i 've spoken to them and said that it 's not likely to happen , and if it does happen , it 's not a bad situation			0
it might be a good thing			0
' like other @entity2 donors , he is a regular visitor to the @entity36 , which , according to its boss , does well because it focuses purely on semen			2
' this is the only thing we do , ' explains @entity35			0
' we do n't do eggs , we do n't do anything else			0
we just do sperm and sperm donation and that allows us to focus on what we do			0
' although the prospect of cash payments is an incentive for some , other donors say its the prospect of helping childless families conceive that brings them to @entity35 's door			0
' i have n't got a lot of money and i need it , ' explains @entity131			0
' but i think i would be 10 times more happy about doing this if i could see some kind of reaction , some kind of pay - off in the happiness of these people			0
' it 's a good purpose and it helps people who can not have children			2
instead of donating blood , you could do this instead and make people happy			0
' ' it would be nice if there were 100 , 200 children that are half me , ' chuckles fellow donor @entity187 , a married professional in his late 30s			0
' i think it 's funny to think about how many children i can make			0
' but availability is n't the only reason so many @entity15 women want to bear a half - @entity2 child			1
for many , the @entity2 ' handsome blue - eyed , blonde looks and ' dependable natures ' are just as attractive			1
' the blonde hair and the blue eyes appeal , ' laughs one mother who conceived with the help of a @entity2 clinic			2
' the cheekbones as well i think ! ' father of hundreds : for sperm donors like @entity131 and @entity187 , their children could number in the hundreds choice : @entity2 's sperm banks , among them @entity108 , deploy excellent customer service to help boost sales experts such as @entity213 , ceo of the @entity214 , say the excellent customer service deployed by @entity37 's sperm banks has also contributed to the @entity10 baby boom			1
' it 's much easier for a @entity15 clinic to order sperm from @entity2 which is @entity221 - exed the next day than to try and recruit their own donors and all the hassle that goes with them , ' says @entity213			1
' the @entity2 model is customer service driven			2
it knows how to deal well with customers , it has a good website , and that 's what we could do in the @entity15 as well - it 's not rocket science			1
' ' @entity2 is geographically close to the @entity15 , ' adds dr @entity44			1
' i think there 's some sort of philosophical and intellectual bond that we have with @entity2			2
' @entity239 , a @entity15 woman who became mother to a son , @entity241 , with her partner @entity242 , agrees and says she plans to teach her little boy about his @entity2 heritage when the time comes			1
' for @entity242 and i , it will be very important to explain things to @entity241 , to take him to @entity2 and to show him the @entity10 boats , ' she explains			2
hello handsome : good - looking @entity2 such as @entity251 's @entity250 , 41 , have helped boost demand ' it 's part of who he is so we have to explain to him about that , to educate him about that			1
i was actually in @entity2 a couple of weeks ago and i brought him back a little @entity10 hat to celebrate his @entity262			2
i do n't think he was too impressed in the beginning but then he got used to it ! ' ' it 's a bit like the @entity10 invasion of 800 ad , ' adds an amused dr @entity44			0
' they 've invaded us once by boat and now they 're doing it by sperm ! ' needless to say , the @entity2 donors and sperm banks behind the influx of @entity20 semen see it slightly differently			1
' i feel quite international , ' comments @entity187			0
' the international father ! ' but , he adds , ' we 're just helping you [ @entity15 mothers ]			2
' i 'm not thinking about the @entity284 , ' he continues			0
' i think [ sperm donations ] could be a great help for you in the @entity15 and that 's very good			1
' hear more about @entity15 's demand for @entity2 sperm in @entity291 tomorrow at 11am on @entity292			1
