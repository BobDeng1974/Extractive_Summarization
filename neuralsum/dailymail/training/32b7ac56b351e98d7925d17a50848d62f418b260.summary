by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 22:14 est , 18 december 2013 @entity3 : 03:12 est , 19 december 2013 @entity5 @entity4 : in 1994 , @entity6 -- who then went by @entity4 -- helped mastermind the attack on @entity9 figure skater @entity8 to help improve his wife @entity10 's chances as winning gold the ex-husband of disgraced figure skater @entity10 has given a rare interview as the 20 year anniversary of the scandal approaches early next year			1
@entity4 , who now goes by @entity6 , is the same man who went to jail for masterminding the 1994 @entity19 attack on @entity8 , but he seems more remorseful about how @entity10 ’s life has turned out two decades later			1
‘ she 'll never be remembered for how wonderful a figure skater she was , ’ he said			0
‘ she 'll be remembered for what i talked her into doing			0
’ @entity6 , who remains in the @entity29 town of @entity30 , after returning there when he was released from a two - year stint in prison in 1995 , sat for a rare interview with @entity32 for the blog @entity34			1
‘ the most common question i 'm ever asked , if it comes up , " do you regret what you did ? " ’ said @entity6			1
‘ i guess that 's kind of a yes - and - a - no question			0
yes , it was pretty darn stupid			0
’ but @entity6 goes on to describe a his happy life as a family man with a wife and kids			2
and he seems to believe the 1994 scandal helped him to get there			2
‘ what 's there to regret , ’ he wondered			0
’ he ’s also not totally taking the blame , though , despite @entity10 ’s years of denying she had any knowledge of what @entity4 and his associates , @entity53 , who carried out the attack , and co-conspirators , @entity56 and @entity57 were planning			1
' what 's there to regret ? not much ' : @entity4 is pictured here in 1994 in a court hearing involving the case			1
now on his third marriage and raising tow daughters , he says he regrets little ' we decided to do something really stupid there , and it ruined her ' : @entity4 was sentenced to two years in prison but says his biggest regret is helping ruin @entity10 's career ‘ we , ’ he said , ‘ absolutely rode her career			1
she was the best figure skater — women 's figure skater — that ever lived			0
’ and he insists @entity10 knew what was being planned			1
‘ of course she did			0
i think most people know that she did , ’ he said			0
though he seems to think he ’s in a far better place than his ex-wife these days			0
' @entity83 heard round the world ' : here , @entity8 wails ' why me ? ' after being clubbed in the knee at a @entity19 skating practice			0
the attack began one of the most infamous sagas in sports history ' of course she knew ' : @entity10 ( at right in 1994 and at left much more recently ) maintains that she had no knowledge that the attack was happening , but @entity6 says she gave the okay @entity8 , seen here in 2004 , sat for an upcoming @entity96 documentary on the attack that will air during the @entity98 in february ‘ she 's a very unhappy person , from what i can tell , ’ he said			1
‘ i occasionally see her on television and i kind of see — i 've read some stories in the paper about what her personal life has become and the trouble she 's got there , and it 's just sad to me			0
’ @entity10 and @entity6 divorced in 1993 , according to the piece in @entity34 , reconciled prior to the @entity8 attack and then split for good thereafter			1
@entity6 and @entity10 sold a sex tape and stills of themselves to @entity111 for $ 200,000 plus residuals in june of 1994			1
now in her 40 ’s , married for a third time and with a two - year - old son , @entity10 says she ’s turned to motivational speaking			2
@entity6 recounts in the interview how @entity4 became a punch line on late night television , @entity120 comics , @entity121 and even on @entity122			2
@entity96 and @entity123 are planning to air competing @entity8 / @entity10 documentaries during the upcoming @entity98 as a nod to the anniversary of the january 6 , 1994 attack			1
however , neither network even asked @entity6 for an interview			2
@entity96 snagged a sit - down with @entity8 for its documentary , while @entity10 agreed to appear in both the @entity96 and @entity123 specials			2
but will @entity6 be watching ? ‘ i guess , ’ he said , ‘ it depends on what else is on			0
’ awkward : @entity10 , ( right ) , will appear in both the @entity96 documentary and a competing @entity123 special to mark the 20th anniversary			2
here , the rivals are seen sharing the ice at the @entity140 just weeks after @entity4 had @entity8 attacked			0

now named @entity6 , @entity10 's ex-husband agreed to a rare interview as the 20 year anniversary of the scandal approaches
' we decided to do something really stupid ' : @entity6 says @entity10 knew all about the 1994 attack , though she 's always maintained she did not
' what 's there to regret ? not much , ' says @entity6 , but *admits* he regrets helping ruin @entity10 's once *promising* career
