@entity0 should be stopped from playing rugby until the @entity2 in september after suffering his third bout of concussion in four months			1
that is the view of former @entity8 full back @entity6 , who fears for the @entity11 and @entity12 winger ’s long - term health after revealing his own battle against depression as a result of multiple head injuries			1
@entity17 was left unconscious in friday night ’s @entity19 fixture against @entity20 and @entity6 , knocked out 12 times during his career , is convinced the 22 - year - old has been ‘ let down			1
' @entity6 reveals he battled depression after suffering 12 concussion during his rugby career the weight of impact required to cause a bout of concussion reduces the more times a player suffers head injuries			1
yet there are indications that @entity17 could still play against @entity36 in the @entity38 quarter - final on saturday			1
‘ it ’s a complete disgrace that it ’s got to this stage , ’ @entity6 told @entity39			1
‘ @entity0 has been let down			1
that a player can still be exposed to this at the top level is crazy			0
they ’ve tipped him over the edge now because he ’s had too many concussions in a short period of time			0
he should take six months out , but even then he will be increasingly susceptible			0
‘ i ’ve got metal plates in my jaw , cheekbone and eye socket , but it ’s the unseen damage that worries me			0
there are still moments during the day when i ca n’t remember my best friend ’s name			0
i went through depression , irritability and lack of form after these knocks			2
@entity0 was knocked out again and was forced off after a clash with @entity64 of @entity20 ‘ i nearly walked away from the game in 2008 and , if i ’d had the same information that ’s mainstream today , i probably would have			1
if the brain is gone , you ’re just left with an empty vessel			0
’ @entity0 , who was concussed when playing against the @entity70 in november , remarked that ‘ rugby is not tiddlywinks ’ after he was knocked out twice against @entity72 last month			1
‘ there ’s this standard bravado attitude , ’ said 32 - year - old @entity6 , who believes there is a cultural problem that needs to be addressed			1
‘ @entity0 is right : it ’s not tiddlywinks			1
but this is brain damage we ’re talking about and it can lead to early onset dementia			0
@entity6 has been knocked out 12 times and has suffered because of the multiple head injuries ' players do n’t want to dig in and face up to the dangers			1
they have committed themselves to this career and they love it — it ’s so much fun			0
there ’s a wilful ignorance because you do n’t want to accept the thing you love might end up killing you			0
‘ i know an @entity72 international who suffered a few concussions in one season and now , as a result , he suffers panic attacks			2
but he ’s still playing because the thought of stopping is too scary			2
the money is coming in and he ’s hanging out with his mates every day			0
‘ the players just are n’t educated : a lot of my friends are still playing and their knowledge of the long - term implications is shocking			2
’ @entity17 was unable to continue and @entity6 thinks that he should be prevented from playing until the @entity2 @entity17 ’s latest concussion occurred when he was caught by the knee of @entity112 8 @entity64 , who was shown a red card and will face an @entity116 disciplinary panel this evening			1
after the game @entity12 issued a statement , saying : ‘ @entity17 will continue to be monitored by the @entity119 ’ experienced medical team throughout the weekend			1
‘ as with everyone in the squad , @entity119 place the highest importance on player welfare and as such @entity17 will see a specialist early next week for an assessment			1
’ @entity11 medical manager @entity127 has also been in dialogue with @entity12 ’s doctors over the weekend			2
there was immediate concern for @entity17 after the incident and @entity64 was shown a red card for the clash any subsequent decisions will be highly scrutinised , with @entity17 ’s double blow against @entity72 becoming one of the most controversial incidents of the @entity139			2
the @entity140 were cleared of any wrongdoing after @entity17 was allowed to stay on the field but @entity6 , whose countryman @entity143 signed for @entity144 yesterday , feels the @entity146 body need to take a more pro-active stance			1
return - to - play protocols permit players to be available for selection within six days if they are symptom free , while boxers face a mandatory , 90 - day stand - down if they lose consciousness for less than a minute			2
‘ we need to preserve @entity0 ’s career and life after his career , ’ said @entity6			1
@entity0 suffered concussion against @entity72 in the @entity139 but played on for the rest of the match ‘ but i just do n’t know if rugby is going to manage him properly			1
even if he passes all the assessments , they are far too flawed			0
there will be great pressure to get him fit for the business end of the season but you ’re playing with fire			2
he needs to be protected from his club and country			2
independent experts need to make the decision			0
‘ far too much faith is put in the protocols			0
when a player gets concussed it should be an absolute minimum of 21 days ’ rest			0
there ’s no way they should be playing six days later			0
a bruised leg does n’t recover in six days and a bruised brain certainly does n’t			0
‘ because we ca n’t see a bruised brain , people do n’t look at it the same way			0
it ’s utter nonsense and business aspects are prioritised above player welfare			0
there is no room for error			0

@entity6 thinks @entity0 should *n't* play rugby until the @entity2
the winger was knocked out cold playing for club side @entity12
@entity17 has suffered concussion three times in the past year
