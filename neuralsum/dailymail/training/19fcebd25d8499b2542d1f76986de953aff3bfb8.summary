by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 3 august 2012 updated : 18:22 est , 3 august 2012 @entity2 's doctors told him he might never run again			1
not on an elite level			2
and surely not in the @entity4			2
yet here he is in @entity6 , less than four years after gang members shot the former @entity9 track star three times in the legs in a case of mistaken identity			1
just a year ago he underwent his third and final operation to remove the last remnants of bullet fragments in his left hamstring			1
he will make his long - awaited @entity21 debut on saturday in the preliminary heats of the 400 meters - the same event that features double - amputee @entity31 of @entity33			1
the man known as ' @entity31 ' fought to compete alongside the other sprinters at @entity36			2
there 's also the first big sprint showdown at the track between the @entity22 and @entity40 in the women 's 100 - meter final			1
in the pool , @entity42 will wrap up his final olympics in the 400 - meter medley relay looking to add to his record medal haul			1
already , @entity2 says , he has won just by wearing the @entity22 uniform when plenty of people questioned whether he 'd even walk after the attack following a @entity51 in 2008			1
shooting : the @entity9 sprinter underwent three surgeries after he was shot in the leg in 2008 by gang members who mistook him for someone else mission : getting back on both feet , @entity2 pressed toward his goal of running again , despite the sometimes excruciating pain felt from his injuries the 23 - year - old @entity2 is now mixing company with some of the very track stars he has watched and admired in recent @entity4 : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67			1
' i 'm happy to be here to represent where i come from and what i believe in , and my country , ' @entity2 said			2
' i 've been through a lot making the team already			2
i have to continue to work toward my goals			2
' for him to be competing in these @entity4 would have been unimaginable only four years ago - two months after @entity76			1
but @entity2 immediately committed himself to the challenging comeback			2
some days , he crawled across the finish line at practice in agony and tears , the pain in his legs so great			2
@entity85 coach @entity84 , with him throughout the journey and by his side for the @entity88 , never doubted @entity2 could do it			1
then @entity2 finished third at the @entity21 trials in june in @entity91 , @entity92 , behind defending gold medalist @entity93 and @entity94			1
@entity2 's mom , @entity95 , put her life aside and dedicated herself to the recovery of her only child			2
' oh , wow , ' she said moments before her flight to @entity6 from @entity101 on thursday			0
' words ca n't even explain the feeling			0
it 's like real heaven			0
i 'm starting to cry right now			0
' @entity2 took a bullet to each thigh and another in the left hamstring during the shooting outside a restaurant near @entity85 's campus as he left the @entity51			1
two gang members were sentenced last august to 15 years each in prison for the crime			1
prosecutors said the men mistook @entity2 for a rival gang member			1
winning : on saturday @entity2 , running right , will make his long - awaited @entity21 debut in the 400 meters despite the athlete saying he already feels like he won having made it this far @entity2 has chalked it up to ' wrong place , wrong time , ' unwilling to let that one bad - luck moment derail a promising career			1
he arrived at college as the 2007 national track athlete of the year from @entity128 , the first in @entity9 to ever win state championships in the 200 and 400 meters in back - to - back seasons			1
then he sustained a season - ending hamstring injury in his first race			1
not quite eight months later , he was shot			2
it has been an exhausting journey back , through operations and rehabilitation , and teaching his legs how to function again			0
he 's counting on those limbs being in top form			0
' i 'm enjoying every bit of it , ' @entity2 said			0
' yeah , i made it , but i have another goal			0
i guess after it 's all over with , when i 'm by myself , then i will have time to think about it			0
' repair : one year after his last operation to remove the last traces of bullets in his leg , a scar is the only thing left on the @entity21 runner shooters : @entity2 's shooters @entity159 , left , and @entity160 , right , were found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison as @entity21 track and field gets in full swing this weekend , @entity2 is trying to balance soaking in everything from his first @entity4 with performing at his very best at the exact right time			1
' he has stayed very focused and he 's keeping everything in perspective , ' @entity84 said			0
' the practices have been going well and it 's just getting ready to race			0
the real test will be the race			0
drawing the heats , you have to be lucky and good			0
' @entity2 said he learned to keep life in perspective , keep sports in perspective			0
watching the opening ceremony in the stadium where he 'll compete , it was tough to control the emotion			0
' that was a great experience , with a lot of flashing lights and a lot of athletes , ' he said			0
