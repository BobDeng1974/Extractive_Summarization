' it 's much like when you go into a shop - there are prevention measures within shops , whether it be security guards or things locked away that you ca n't get to , which is going to prevent crime , and i think social media sites need to think long and hard about being able to prevent it from happening in the first place			0
' crime has completely changed			0
internet crime and e-crime , including the kind of trolling that we 've seen this week , is hugely on the rise			0
members of the public do n't really understand what to do about it as well , so it goes unreported			0
