here 's something for @entity1 to ponder during his @entity3 ’s week - long training camp in @entity4			1
if his side are to go and win this season ’s title with the expected degrees of comfort and entertainment , can he really do without @entity10 ? the 31 - year - old made his first league start since november and injected a different dimension of invention compared to the recent toils of the @entity17 outfit			1
@entity3 defender @entity18 ( left ) fires from close range to give @entity3 the lead against @entity22 the 28 - year - old celebrates after giving the @entity23 a half - time lead at @entity25 @entity22 : @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 ( @entity34 80 ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 35 ) , @entity37 , @entity38 subs : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 bookings : @entity29 , @entity33 @entity3 : @entity46 , @entity47 ( @entity48 75 ) , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , commons , @entity55 ( @entity56 85 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 82 ) subs : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 goals : @entity51 ( 36 ) , @entity57 ( 72 ) bookings : @entity10 , @entity51 referee : @entity67 ( @entity68 ) he endured an extraordinary level of misfortune when it came to actually putting the ball in the net – twice striking the woodwork and seeing numerous other efforts blocked – but was unquestionably the driving force behind a collective performance far more convincing than the relatively slender scoreline suggests			1
goals from @entity51 and @entity57 eventually sealed a victory that pulled @entity3 back within a point of leaders @entity82 - with a game in hand - as they prepare for what now appears an ill - timed mid-campaign break			1
the @entity82 could well be four in front again by the time the champions return from the @entity88 , having used @entity90 dispensation to postpone this weekend ’s meeting with @entity92			1
whether @entity10 ’ future will be any clearer by that point remains to be seen			2
with his contract due to expire in the summer , talks over an extension have stalled on the length and structure of the deal			2
@entity103 ’s @entity102 are among the club ’s circling			0
here , though , was strong evidence that he still has so much to offer			0
replacing him would be a mightily difficult challenge			0
when it comes to sculpting something out of nothing , to providing a sudden injection of adrenaline for supporters , @entity3 have no - one to compare			1
@entity3 midfielder @entity54 ( left ) is stopped in his tracks by a strong challenge from @entity29 his meagre level of deployment by @entity1 this season remains baffling			1
true , he is n’t the kind of supreme athlete who can always press with the intensity the @entity125 wants			0
but the positives he harbours surely outweigh any negatives			0
@entity22 would certainly he happy to see the back of him			1
this was an evening of regular discomfort for @entity35 ’s side , who can only feel thankful not to have conceded more			0
they remain seventh , two points adrift of @entity92 as they attempt to claim a top - half finish			1
there was an unfamiliar air to the @entity3 line - up selected to take to the artificial surface – a pitch they had been denied access to train on in the build - up to the match			1
in the end , though , much of this match bore the look of a run - of - the - mill session			2
youngster @entity55 was included , while @entity1 demoted @entity58 to the bench after previously turning psychologist in an attempt to nurse the previously prolific @entity153 through a five - game goalless streak			1
that decision meant a third @entity158 start for @entity159 striker @entity57 , still seeking to convince in the wake of his summer £ 2.3 million switch from @entity163			1
there was also a slot for @entity10 - last in an opening selection for the @entity168 dead rubber against @entity169 - in what may or may not prove to be his final appearance for the @entity17 club given the transfer window is now open			2
@entity3 winger @entity10 strikes a fierce left - footed effort on goal during the opening 45 minutes perhaps , though , this was deila considering horses for courses			1
commons netted a hat - trick here for @entity3 last march			1
@entity22 looked well aware of his threat as he was dumped to the sodden surface inside 30 seconds following a collision with @entity189			1
a follow - up from @entity33 a couple of minutes later had @entity1 waving his arms in protest			2
commons would indulge in a spot of retribution later in the half with a late challenge on @entity33 that earned a yellow card from @entity67			0
yet it was his creative talents that truly caught the eye in a first half @entity3 utterly dominated			1
he looked entirely like a man with a point to prove			2
in fact , the only surprise came when he was n’t actually involved in the opening goal that finally arrived nine minutes before the break			0
it was still a thing to admire			0
@entity51 bolted down the left flank , got the ball back via @entity54 and finished beautifully off the outside of his boot			1
the strike was a reward for almost constant pressure			0
@entity54 was the first to threaten when played through but seemed to be waiting for a written invitation			0
@entity29 nipped in to intercept before incurring a booking for angrily disputing the resulting corner			0
@entity22 midfielder @entity28 ( left ) looks to put in a challenge on @entity54 ( right ) @entity55 had a shot bravely blocked by @entity27 before @entity10 took over			2
a snapshot from 25 yards struck the junction of post and bar			0
another effort was dragged wide after set - up play from @entity54 and @entity57			1
quick feet then shifted him away from @entity28 to fire narrowly over , before clipping the bar again following a fluid move that featured @entity55 , @entity231 and @entity47			0
there was still time for one more ahead of the interval , when he took a pass from @entity55 to thrash in an effort that was beaten out by @entity26			0
commons must have spent the break wondering quite how his name had n’t entered the scoresheet			0
the sound of sombre reflection surely filled @entity22 ’s dressing room			2
@entity35 had started with @entity37 behind @entity38 and two wingers			0
it was bold but painfully open			0
the only test they offered @entity46 was a @entity38 header from an @entity37 free - kick that the @entity3 goalkeeper safely clutched down low			1
it seemed , therefore , to be a tactical decision when @entity35 replaced his namesake @entity254 with @entity36 after 34 minutes			0
@entity256 defender @entity255 commands possession with @entity22 's @entity27 in close attention a rasping low drive from @entity33 that zipped just beyond @entity46 ’s right - hand post gave the home fans a flicker of excitement as the second half got underway			1
@entity10 , however , was soon back in the saddle			0
a scalpel - like through - ball found @entity55 , who should have done better than an attempt that was neither a cross nor a shot			2
the former @entity271 man then turned neatly inside the area , but his power - packed drive was deflected too high for another corner			2
while the single - goal margin somehow remained in place , there were always going to be nervy moments for @entity3			1
@entity36 supplied one via a dipping effort that was expertly tipped away by @entity46			0
that anxiety was finally dispelled with 19 minutes remaining			0
@entity54 delivered a corner that @entity49 headed on , with @entity57 claiming the final touch .			2

@entity3 secure 2 - 0 win at @entity22 on monday night
goals from @entity51 and @entity57 enough for @entity23 to earn first win in three league games
