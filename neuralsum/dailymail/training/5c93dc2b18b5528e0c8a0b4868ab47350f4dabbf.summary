lord @entity0 : ' innovative policies ' a row erupted last night after a favourite to take over the @entity4 appeared to suggest that billions of pounds of government debt should be written off			1
lord @entity0 , chairman of the @entity6 , set alarm bells ringing when he called for ‘ more innovative and unconventional policies ’ to kick - start the economy			1
he warned that quantitative easing , the @entity4 ’s controversial money printing programme designed to boost growth , now has ‘ little impact ’			1
lord @entity0 – a frontrunner to succeed sir @entity14 as governor of the @entity4 – did not spell out what was required instead in his @entity18 speech on thursday night			1
but it is thought one option could involve the @entity4 telling the @entity21 it does not have to repay all the £ 375billion of government bonds it has bought through @entity24 – effectively cancelling the debt			1
such a move would be seen as creating ‘ helicopter money ’ – a term for when governments print money to finance spending as though dropping cash out of the sky			2
sources close to @entity0 insisted it was ‘ completely wrong ’ to suggest he advocated such a policy			2
‘ @entity37 [ @entity0 ] is not pushing or suggesting any particular policy ideas , ’ one said yesterday			2
but his speech sparked outrage with critics warning that cancelling the debt would shatter the government ’s economic credibility and drive up inflation			0
it also cast doubt over lord @entity0 ’s chances of taking over as bank governor next year			1
‘ his credentials are n’t good enough to look after petty cash in a tobacco kiosk , ’ said @entity50 , co-founder of stock broker @entity51			0
desperate measures : critics said if the @entity4 let the government off its debts it would be disaster for the economy ‘ he ’s done a poor job at the @entity6 and he made the wrong call on the euro			1
the guy is very intelligent but has no common sense			0
’ @entity69 mp @entity68 warned that if the bank ‘ let off ’ the government over its debts it would be a disaster for the economy			0
‘ the reality is that if you cancel the debt you debase the currency , ’ she said			0
‘ the whole reason we have kept our credit rating and the market is still buying our debt is that we have credibility and investors believe that the government is going to pay its way out of our economic woes			0
’ the @entity4 distanced itself from the idea yesterday , pointing out that sir @entity14 said in august that ‘ cancelling the bonds ’ would be ‘ appalling behaviour ’			2
the @entity24 programme was launched in 2009 in an attempt to drag the economy out of recession			2
critics claim it has destroyed the retirement plans of a million workers by driving down annuity rates			0
n @entity4 deputy governor @entity101 last night warned of an ‘ uncontainable ’ backlash if taxpayers are forced to bail out banks again			2
‘ the objective is to get to a position where public money is never used to provide support for a bank failure , ’ he told the @entity105 in @entity106			0
if @entity0 believes the government should be let off the hook for its @entity24 debt , then it would be very dangerous to let him anywhere near the top job at the @entity4 , writes @entity117			1
he has made no secret of his desire to step into the shoes of sir @entity14 , pictured right , and it would make for an eye - catching job application : ‘ hire me , mr @entity123 , and i ’ll forget the £ 375billion of @entity24 money you owe the bank ’			0
lord @entity0 ’s aides yesterday denied that he is proposing to cancel @entity24 borrowings			1
but he has apparently briefed @entity130 business editor @entity129 and there was a remarkably well - informed piece this week by a leading @entity134 columnist , vaunting @entity0 as a ‘ breath of fresh air ’			2
that article mentioned @entity0 ’s ‘ private view ’ that the @entity138 should look at ‘ monetising ’ debt and consider ‘ blatantly printing money ’			1
@entity24 involves the @entity4 creating money and using it to buy up gilts , or government debt , from pension funds and banks			1
the money that flows into the wider economy then , in theory , stimulates growth			1
printing money to finance the government ’s debts may sound like an easy and tempting solution , but many serious economists would condemn it as the fast - track to ruin			1
it ’s not so very different from you or i paying our mortgages by setting up a counterfeiting press in the back bedroom – and similarly , it is probably not even legal			0
money printing followed by debt default is behaviour associated with a banana republic			1
as well as the risk of unleashing rampant inflation , it would jeopardise our reputation on the money markets as a credit - worthy country			0
pensioners , who have already seen their life - savings depleted by @entity24 , would suffer even more			0
it would also make a mockery of attempts to control runaway public spending			0
why bother , if the bills need never be paid ? it is not only the economics of the madhouse , it is morally bankrupt .			0

lord @entity0 said the @entity4 ’s controversial money printing programme had failed to boost growth
the current chairman of the @entity6 , called for ' more innovative and unconventional policies ' to *rejuvenate* the economy
