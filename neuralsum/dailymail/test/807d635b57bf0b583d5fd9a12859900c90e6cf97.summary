@entity0 has changed its account of how chief foreign correspondent @entity2 was kidnapped in @entity3 , saying he was now most likely taken by @entity5 rebels who tried to convince their victims they were government militants			1
the broadcaster had previously reported that the 2012 kidnapping of mr @entity2 , which saw him held for five days and expecting to be killed , was carried out by forces associated with president @entity10			1
but mr @entity2 has revealed that following analysis of his kidnapping it is likely the men that took him were in fact a @entity5 group who had tried to convince their victims that they were @entity19 - ite rebels affiliated to the government			1
the group that kidnapped us was a criminal gang with shifting allegiances			2
' the statement also raises concerns that rather than being freed following a harrowing firefight , as they were told , this may actually have been staged for propaganda purposes			2
instead the captives may just have been handed over			0
the statement added : ' we have not been able to get a definitive account of what happened that night			0
but based on all of our reporting , it is clear that we were kidnapped by a criminal gang for money and released for propaganda purposes			0
' this , of course , does not make our kidnappers or the five days they held us at gunpoint any less dangerous			1
it does , however , underscore the treacherous and violent nature of the conflict inside @entity3			2
' mr @entity2 and his team were prompted to research the circumstances of the 2012 kidnapping after the @entity63 raised questions over the attackers ' identities			2
they suggested the kidnapping was likely to have been carried out by a @entity5 criminal element of the @entity70 , linked to the @entity71 and known for taking hostages			2
the @entity63 claimed that @entity0 executives were informed of the suspicions about the kidnappers ' identities during and after mr @entity2 was taken			1
mr @entity2 was convinced by his captors that he had been taken and held by government affiliated forces but immediately after his release mr @entity2 appeared on today and in a @entity82 interview claiming he had been taken by the shabiha group , government militia loyal to president @entity10			1
he made these assertions based on what he had been told by his captors , which included that they had been rescued by @entity5 rebels			1
the paper claimed that when the captors realised other rebels were trying to free the victims they had actually staged a rescue so they could blame the kidnapping on the @entity10 regime			1
@entity2 and his crew , including producers @entity97 and @entity23 , as well as cameraman @entity25 , were taken hostage on december 13 , 2012 , while reporting in @entity3			1
the foreign correspondent said they had met a man who had claimed he was a @entity3 rebel commander who had promised to take them across the border to see @entity106 and @entity107 prisoners being held by rebels			1
@entity3 run for cover after a mortar shell hit a street killing several in the @entity113 district of @entity114 they were soon removed from a truck and loaded into a container vehicle by armed men where they were bound , blindfolded and stripped of their passports and shoes			0
the kidnappers forced the group to make a video and unwittingly set off a distress gps signal , which informed @entity0 exactly where they were			0
@entity0 was able to broadcast images of the farm they were being held at across the world , also informing their kidnappers they knew of the location			0
@entity2 and his crew were believed to have been taken near @entity134 - arrat @entity133 , and were pictured in captivity with @entity136 sprayed on the wall behind them			1
it read : ‘ @entity140 will burn			0
’ a statement published by @entity0 said it was clear that the group were released for propaganda purposes during the five days they were held mr @entity2 reported apparently hearing one of the rebels they were with being shot , and constantly being subjected to the sounds of guns being loaded - believing each day was his last			1
he claimed they were constantly tormented by the kidnappers			0
as an example , the 39 - year - old correspondent said that one minute , their captors were giving them tea , and the next , they were demanding the crew decide who would be killed first			0
on the fifth night they were loaded , while blindfolded , into a van			0
they were told they would be handed over to military forces in @entity164			0
as they reached a checkpoint there was the sound of gunfire and a dead body was seen on the floor			0
@entity2 has since said , in light of the new information , this may have been staged to convince them they were rescued rather than handed over			2
@entity2 , who is divorced and does n't have children , was promoted to @entity0 's chief foreign correspondent in 2008 .			0

@entity2 was kidnapped in @entity3 with his crew and held for five days
his captors told group they were militants associated with @entity10
but new *evidence* suggests the kidnappers posed as government forces
they were in fact @entity5 militants who also staged an elaborate rescue
