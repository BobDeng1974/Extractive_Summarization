it may not be stamped in your passport , but everyone on @entity4 is now officially a citizen of @entity5			2
that is the name scientists have given the gigantic super-cluster of galaxies that contains our own @entity10 , which is revealed in a stunning new 3d animation			0
the word means ' immeasurable heaven ' in @entity15 - an appropriate description for a structure 500 million light years across that contains 100,000 galaxies and the mass of a hundred quadrillion suns			1
@entity5 is 500 million light years across it contains 100,000 galaxies it has the mass of a hundred quadrillion suns around @entity5 are four neighbouring superclusters known as @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity34 - @entity33 first supercluster to have its size mapped by astronomers			1
and @entity5 itself forms just one corner of the observable universe			0
scientists have long - known that galaxies are not distributed randomly but congregate together in clusters			0
on the largest scales , galaxies are strung out like pearls , forming glowing ' filaments '			0
where these intersect they produce enormous ' superclusters ' of galaxies whose motion is affected by gravity			0
a slice of the @entity56 in the supergalactic equatorial plane the @entity10 sits near the edge of one such supercluster , the first to have its size mapped by astronomers			1
within @entity5 , galaxies flow inwards towards a region called the @entity64 , the equivalent of a large gravitational valley			2
around @entity5 are four neighbouring superclusters known as @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
a 3d cutaway of the new supercluster dr @entity69 , from the @entity70 in @entity71 , led the team of scientists that mapped @entity5 's boundaries from measurements of the velocities of local galaxies			1
the researchers compared the galactic flow with that of water in a landscape of hills and valleys , tracing the outer surface of a region where the net - motion of galaxies was inward			0
they wrote in the journal nature : ' we define a supercluster to be the volume within such a surface , and so we are defining the extent of our home supercluster , which we call @entity5			2
