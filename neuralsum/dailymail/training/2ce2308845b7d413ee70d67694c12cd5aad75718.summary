by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 must dip his toe into the transfer market before the deadline passes if @entity6 want any chance of winning the @entity9 title			1
that 's the view of @entity11 , who believes the @entity12 are set to lag behind @entity13 and @entity14 if they do n't bring in another striker			0
@entity16 is out until the end of december after breaking his leg away at @entity19 , with @entity20 leading the line in midweek against @entity22			1
' we thought even before @entity16 got injured that @entity2 would want to sign a top centre forward , ' @entity11 told skysports.com			2
' if we 're judging them on getting third or fourth place , then @entity6 might not have a problem			0
but if we 're judging them in terms of targeting a title , which i think is where @entity2 and the @entity6 fans are at , then they 're going to have to sign a centre forward â€“ and probably a central midfield player as well			2
' we 're imagining @entity20 as someone who is going to be played as a wide forward but he can play as a centre forward ; he is tough and durable			0
but you think they are going to need somebody , unless he 's going to put faith in @entity55 or @entity56			0
' leading the line : @entity20 ( centre ) scored playing through the middle against @entity22 in midweek			1

@entity2 needs to dip back into the transfer market
@entity16 is *missing* for the next four months with a broken leg
@entity20 was the central frontman against @entity22 in midweek
