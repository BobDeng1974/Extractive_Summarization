you always make contingency plans			2
we have a much bigger scouting network here			2
in @entity38 it was only me , but we always have the chance to bring in good players			2

if no one wants your players then you are doing something wrong			0
‘ there are always going to be rumours , but that is all they are at the moment			0
‘ when someone faxes @entity1 with an offer then it is real and we will have to make a decision			1
‘ but there is nothing concrete right now and i am positive about the rest of the window as well			0
‘ @entity92 ( @entity93 ) does n’t call me to tell me it ’s a rumour			0
he will call me when there is something true and so far i ’ve heard nothing			0
‘ i am hoping that remains the case			0
