by @entity0 published : 05:05 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 07:09 est , 14 december 2012 fiddled : @entity1 , 57 , who represented @entity2 for 13 years , claimed nearly her entire annual allowance in one bogus expense entry and forged invoices for more than £ 20,000 disgraced former @entity8 mp @entity7 has been spared jail for fiddling expenses to receive more than £ 53,000 from the taxpayer			1
@entity1 , 57 , who represented @entity2 for 13 years , claimed nearly her entire annual allowance in one bogus expense entry and forged invoices for more than £ 20,000 for non-existent goods and services			1
the mp 's claims were the largest amount uncovered in the wake of the @entity19 ' expenses scandal , but she does not receive a criminal conviction after a judge ruled she was unfit to stand trial for mental health reasons			1
she was sentenced today at @entity24 to a two year supervision and treatment order after her lawyers told the court she is so mentally ill she can not leave home without being restrained			1
however , only last month , she was photographed popping out to the pub without any apparent need for restraints			1
and it emerged today that she could still be forced to repay the money after the prosecution revealed that they were considering taking civil action against the mp to recover it			1
mrs @entity7 was not present at @entity24 to hear mr @entity37 make the ruling			0
he said : ' there will inevitably be feelings among some that mrs @entity7 has " got away with it "			1
' what the court has done and has to do is to act in accordance with the law of the land and on the basis of the evidence that it hears			1
' the judge said two distinguished psychiatrists instructed by the defence had concluded she was unfit to plead , and a psychiatrist instructed by the prosecution broadly agreed			1
' all the evidence in the case was that she was unfit to plead			0
if i had reached any other conclusion my decision would have been perverse and would inevitably have been successfully appealed			1
' a jury decided that she did the acts alleged against her , and the defence played little if any part in the hearing			0
' the findings of the court were not convictions			0
those findings enable me to make orders requiring her to undergo treatment for her mental health , ' the judge added			2
out and about : former mp @entity7 is pictured leaving a pub in @entity79 only five days after she was deemed unfit to stand trial able to drink : despite a judge ruling she was too fragile to defend herself in court , mp @entity7 appeared to enjoy a glass of red wine at the pub near her @entity88 home up for a walk : ms @entity7 was later seen at @entity90 , walking her dog with her husband last month dr @entity94 , from the @entity93 in @entity79 , said that he last saw @entity1 on tuesday and that she was teetering on the brink of a breakdown as a result of the press coverage surrounding her case			1
' she is experiencing panic attacks which make her believe she is going to be door - stepped at any point , ' he told the court			2
@entity1 submitted parliamentary expense forms ( censored example pictured ) for claims including £ 979.84 for a kitchen that was never installed , £ 2,283 for a telephone line that did not exist and £ 2,678.76 for a carpet she went on to claim for again			2
in one case she claimed £ 22,500 - just under the annual maximum expense allowance for an mp - to treat dry rot at her @entity79 home , using the money instead to pay for a lavish refurbishment			1
she arranged for the taxpayer to foot the bill for personal expenses totalling nearly £ 60,000 between 2004 and 2008			2
during that time the former @entity2 mp also ‘ flipped ’ her designated second home in order to make claims for properties in @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity79			1
' there is almost a tendency for her to feel threatened whenever she does leave home			2
’ @entity94 said @entity1 would have had to be forced to come to court , such is the severity of her physical and mental conditions			2
' she has severe and concentrated panic attacks , nausea , and vomiting ' , he said			0
' i do n’t believe it would be possible to physically remove her from home without restraints			0
' mr @entity138 said one report had indicated @entity1 could suffer a massive heart attack if she was forced to sit in the dock			2
dr @entity94 replied : ' she has suffered raised blood pressure for some months and had to attend casualty because of an allergic reaction to hypertension medicine			0
' he added : ' she 's living a restricted lifestyle , she 's not answered the telephone at home for approximately three years , she goes out very occasionally , to a local supermarket for 30 minutes			1
' meanwhile , her barrister @entity152 attacked press intrusion into her life in the wake of the scandal			0
‘ the more vengeful form of press who hounded her at her front door seem to think only someone is demonstrably mentally ill is in a straight jacket in a padded cell drooling and incapable of speech ’ , he said			0
‘ the hounding of a mentally ill woman is a dangerous and vile thing to do at any time , particularly @entity168 , ' he added			0
changed : ms @entity7 's appearance had changed dramatically since the 2010 election when she appeared at a court hearing in september 2011 paparazzi photographers snapped @entity1 two weeks ago walking her dog with her husband , and stopping at a pub near to her home			0
‘ mrs @entity7 ’s husband was distressed by the attempt to door step her two weeks ago ’ , said mr @entity177			0
‘ all reports agreed it could have led to an increased risk of suicide			0
‘ the headlines in @entity186 show there are always people who believe it is a huge con			0
‘ but none of them read all the evidence , and the person best placed to make the decisions is my lord			0

*ex-labour* mp forged invoices to claim biggest sum in expenses scandal
