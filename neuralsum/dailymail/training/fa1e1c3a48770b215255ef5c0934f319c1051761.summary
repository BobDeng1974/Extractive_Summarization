by @entity1 reporter published : 20:31 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 20:31 est , 25 january 2013 hedgehog numbers have declined by more than a third in the past decade , research reveals			0
the fall is being blamed on their access to food being reduced by a loss of hedgerows , larger field sizes and greater use of garden fencing			1
between 2003 and 2012 , surveys by the @entity14 found that sightings of hedgehogs in towns and cities across @entity19 had fallen by 37 per cent			1
worrying : sightings of hedgehogs in @entity19 have declined by 37 per cent between 2003 and 2012 the amount of prey available for the mammals to feed on has fallen due to the use of pesticides , while in urban areas , tidy , sterile gardens has also contributed to their demise			1
experts also believe the decline in numbers is linked to the loss of permanent grasslands and the intensification of agriculture			2
‘ over the last 20 years or so , the world ’s tiger population is thought to have halved , ’ said surveys officer @entity36			1
‘ although they are very different animals and there are many fewer tigers left in the wild , the fact that we are losing hedgehogs in @entity19 as quickly should ring alarm bells as loudly			0
' we are very concerned			0
hedgehogs are quite not fussy feeders , so they should be able to get by even in a bad year			0
problems : the dramatic fall in the population of one @entity19 's most beloved garden visitors is being blamed on a loss of hedgerows , larger fields sizes and greater use of fencing ' so a fall in numbers suggest a bigger problem , particularly with the diversity of creatures in our soil and the health of the land			1
' the biggest issue is the loss of habitat , such as hedgerows , and bigger intensively - farmed fields			2
in urban areas , the use of fences makes many gardens inaccessible , while paving and decking are not good hunting ground			0
' in an effort to gather further data about hedgehogs , the trust is appealing for volunteers to take part in the @entity84 which starts on friday 1 february			0
' continuous monitoring each year is vital to help us build a more complete picture of the state of the @entity19 's wild mammal populations , ' said mr @entity36 .			2

sightings have fallen by 37 per cent between 2003 and 2012
loss of hedgerows , larger field sizes and fencing to blame
' we *'re* very concerned ' says surveys expert @entity36
