nos 50 - 41 : includes @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2			1
nos 40 - 31 : includes @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5			0
the centre forward : the leader from the front , the @entity10 9 , the provider , the talisman , the goalscorer			0
since 1992 , the @entity12 has been blessed with the best , from homegrown talents @entity13 and @entity15 , to foreign imports @entity17 and @entity18 , but unfortunately there have also been some major disappointments			2
whether failing to justify their huge price tag , or just incapable of hitting a barn door , there have been some dreadful forwards			0
as we build - up to the return of the @entity12 following the international break			2
@entity29 runs you through @entity31 30 - 21 of the worst strikers to have ever played in the division ... do you agree ? 30 ) @entity34 ( @entity35 ) he may have been a cult hero with @entity35 fans following his £ 6.9million transfer from @entity39 club @entity38 in january 2002 , but the @entity40 simply did not take to life in the @entity12 - and it took him an incredible 27 games to get off the mark ! it seems strange that such a talented footballer - who has excelled for @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , among others - struggled so desperately at @entity51 , but sometimes the face simply does not fit			1
rather amusingly , @entity34 was told to wear longer studs in order to get greater grip in the pitch but sir @entity57 discovered he was failing to follow orders and he was promptly marched towards the exit door in 2004 having scored just 10 in 63 @entity12 games			1
@entity34 moved to @entity35 from @entity38 for £ 6.9million in january 2002 but failed to adapt to the @entity12 @entity34 ( left ) is held back by @entity61 of @entity62 during a match in march 2004 at @entity51 the @entity40 forward managed just 10 games in 63 @entity12 games for @entity35 during a three - year spell at the club 29 ) @entity69 ( @entity62 ) @entity62 supporters thought they were getting the real deal when @entity69 arrived for £ 11m from @entity72 in may 2000 - but they did n't anticipate how much of a struggle it would be for @entity75 to adjust to the @entity77 style of play			1
despite being the man who was supposed to bridge the gap to north @entity81 rivals @entity82 , all @entity69 managed in four years at @entity83 was 10 goals in 60 @entity12 matches as he was frozen out by @entity85			1
he moved to @entity86 , then in the @entity87 , and netted just once at @entity88 before returning to his native country where he has gone on to become the highest scorer in the history of the @entity92			0
@entity69 moved to @entity62 for £ 11m in may 2000 from @entity72 but struggled to adapt to @entity77 football the @entity75 ( left ) is held off by @entity94 of @entity95 in july 2000 at @entity96 's @entity69 went back to his native country and became the highest scorer in the history of the @entity92 28 ) @entity97 ( @entity98 ) just as everything was going down the swanny for @entity98 and they thought it could n't possibly get any worse they only went and splashed £ 2.5m to bring @entity97 from @entity103 in 2000			1
the @entity106 forward 's striking ability , much like the unfortunately - doomed club 's future , was non-existent and he managed just two @entity12 goals in 12 games			2
to be fair those strikes came against @entity112 and @entity82 , but 6ft 2in @entity97 's lack of mobility and shyness in front of goal meant he was quickly shipped back to @entity106 and @entity119 fans no longer had to sigh whenever the big man received the ball			2
@entity97 signed for @entity98 from @entity103 for £ 2.5m in 2000 but his striking ability was essentially non-existent @entity97 , pictured holding off @entity123 of @entity35 , scored just two goals in 12 @entity12 games for the @entity119 27 ) @entity126 ( @entity127 ) @entity127 fans are lucky to have witnessed the likes of @entity13 , @entity130 and @entity131 grace the @entity132 pitch down the years - but they were also forced to endure the painful experience of watching @entity126 try to be a @entity12 striker			1
@entity126 arrived on @entity135 from @entity136 for £ 2m in 1998 but the @entity138 forward was utterly hopeless			0
he scored just four @entity12 goals in 27 appearances and was sent back to @entity138 side @entity141 after only one season in @entity77			0
he was so bad in fact that @entity127 fans only really remember him for the blond locks and ridiculous hairband he sported			0
@entity126 sported blond locks and a ridiculous hairdband at @entity127 during his unsuccessful spell on @entity135 @entity126 , falling over in the penalty area against @entity151 , managed just four goals in 27 @entity12 games 26 ) @entity154 ( @entity155 ) the 1993 @entity138 @entity156 moved to @entity157 for £ 2.5m from @entity158 in 1997 having bagged 10 goals in 19 games while on loan at @entity162 the season before			1
highly - praised during the 1992 @entity87 for @entity163 , @entity154 's time at @entity155 was decimated by a training ground injury - which eventually forced him to retire - and he is remembered as a big disappoitnment			2
a mere four goals arrived in 27 @entity12 appearances during his two years at @entity155 before he was forced to hang up his boots			0
his is one of the sadder stories			0
@entity154 ( centre ) , sent off for @entity155 against @entity173 in 1998 , struggled in @entity77 due to injury the @entity138 managed just four goals in 27 @entity12 appearances after suffering an injury on the training pitch 25 ) @entity178 ( @entity179 ) when a £ 1.7m striker ( a big sum for @entity179 in 1997 ) fails to appear in more than two consecutive games , it tells you all you really need to know about their time in south @entity81			1
@entity178 signed for @entity179 from @entity186 - or more accurately their reserve side - and he arrived in @entity77 hopelessly out of shape and woefully out of form			0
when the @entity179 were relegated , the @entity191 flew off to @entity192 having scored just once in 12 @entity12 matches - only to return to reportedly collect the £ 1m worth of wages he believed the club , who were battling against financial meltdown , owed him			2
maybe he should have thought about scoring more and keeping @entity179 up - then he may even have received a pay rise ! @entity178 ( right ) , arguing with @entity203 of @entity204 in august 1998 , scored just one in 12 @entity12 games the former @entity179 striker ( right ) , being tackled by @entity62 's @entity208 , reportedly returned to the club for unpaid wages 24 ) @entity211 ( @entity212 ) the @entity213 was so hopeless he could n't get anywhere near the @entity212 squad for four months , and this at a time when they were beginning to really struggle in the top flight			1
@entity211 moved to @entity212 on a free transfer from @entity221 in 2006 and during his 18 months on @entity222 it appears he set about attempting to ensure he would be on the list of the @entity12 's worst ever strikers ... here 's how you sum up @entity211 : 23 league appearances , zero goals			1
@entity211 played 23 times for @entity212 in the @entity12 but failed to score a single goal for the club @entity211 arrived on a free transfer from @entity221 in 2006 and spent 18 months on @entity222 before moving on the @entity213 , pictured against @entity234 in december 2007 , was so bad he could n't get near @entity212 's first team for four month 23 ) @entity236 ( @entity237 ) the @entity239 cost a hefty £ 3.25m from grasshoppers in 1998 and , during his exceptionally short stay in the west midlands , he proved to be an extreme pain in the backside for @entity237 boss @entity245			1
@entity236 allegedly criticised @entity245 's capabilities as a manager and also the qualities of the rest of his side - forgetting the adage that people in glass houses should not throw stones			0
he netted just twice in 10 @entity12 appearances before heading for @entity255 - much to the relief of @entity245 and @entity237 fans - just months after signing			2
@entity236 proved to be an extreme pain in the backside for @entity237 boss @entity245 during his time in the west @entity262 the @entity239 striker ( right ) , challenging for the ball with @entity62 's @entity208 in april 1998 , was hopeless at @entity237 22 ) @entity265 ( @entity266 ) one of the very first @entity191 to grace the @entity12 , @entity265 is not quite remembered in the same sort of bracket as the likes of @entity270 or @entity271			0
' @entity272 ' @entity265 arrived at @entity266 for £ 1.8m in 1995 from @entity273 as a 6ft 3in striker with a big reputation yet he looked anything but a player who could play up front			0
he was slow , lackadaisical and generally inept around the park			0
his then - astronomical wages of £ 30,000 a month did not guarantee him hitting the target and when he left having failed to score even once in his 12 @entity12 appearances , manager @entity287 - who allegedly tore up the forward 's contract - declared : ' the whole business turned into a complete fiasco			2
' that 's certainly one word for it ... @entity265 was paid £ 30,000 a month at @entity266 but proved to be completely hopeless during his time at the club the @entity191 was signed from @entity273 for £ 1.8m in 1995 and failed to score in any of his 12 @entity12 appearances 21 ) @entity296 ( @entity297 ) the story of @entity296 at @entity297 is a classic cautionary tale			1
with the @entity297 believing there were acquiring a £ 1.5m signing from @entity40 top - flight side @entity302 , they pursued the deal for @entity296			1
in actual fact , they were signing the forward from a @entity309 team - @entity310 - meaning the difference in quality was quite large ... the @entity313 was on @entity314 from 1999 to 2001 but played only once in the @entity12 - for a grand total of 44 minutes - and needless to say he failed to score			1
@entity297 took legal action against @entity296 , his agent and @entity310 and agreed to settle out of court so they did gain back the majority of the fee			0
they will always have to live with the sheer embarrassment , however			0
@entity296 signed for @entity297 for £ 1.5m in 1999 from @entity310 - but they thought they were getting someone else ! @entity296 ( left ) runs off with fellow @entity326 @entity324 - during the 44 minutes of @entity12 football he actually appeared in			1

@entity29 is counting down the top 50 worst - ever strikers to have played in the @entity12 era
@entity34 , @entity69 and @entity126 feature in third section of list of worst strikers
@entity97 , @entity296 , @entity211 and @entity154 also feature in @entity31 30 - 21 of worst forwards
