a @entity1 fraternity has been shut down after members were caught chanting the n - word and glorifying lynching in a sickening video - on the same day that president @entity6 spoke at the 50th anniversary of the @entity9 march			1
the footage , uploaded to @entity11 sunday , shows members of a @entity14 chapter singing that there ' will never be a n * * * * * ' in their fraternity			1
in the brief clip , one two students stand up to a group of their peers , wearing bow ties and dress shirts , in the vile chant , sung to the tune of @entity26			2
the footage is believed to have been filmed on saturday - when the rest of the nation was focused on @entity9 , @entity29 , where the president said the civil rights movement has not yet completed its long march			1
during the sickening clip the students are clearly heard singing : ' there will never be a n * * * * * @entity14 , there will never be a n * * * * * @entity14			1
' you can hang him from a tree , but he 'll never sign with me , there will never be a n * * * * * @entity14			1
' a female voice in the background can also be heard asking a friend : ' you 've never heard it before ? ' the footage shows the group on a bus , apparently headed to a party			1
it was made public by a black students ' pressure group at the university called @entity74			2
in the wake of the video , the national leadership of @entity14 , which has branches across the country , said the @entity1 chapter would be punished			1
reaction : the national heads of the @entity14 have said those responsible will be punished frat house : the @entity14 base at the @entity1 is pictured above			2
the national organization has some undergraduate 15,000 members @entity88 , the @entity89 of the organization , confirmed that the video was authentic			1
he added that he was ' shocked and disgusted ' by it , and said those responsible ' will be dealt with '			0
@entity88 also said the song , which the video participants seemed to know well , was not part of any @entity14 traditions			1
a statement from @entity14 said : ' @entity14 's national headquarters has closed its @entity102 chapter at the @entity1 following the discovery of an inappropriate video			1
investigation : @entity1 president @entity106 released a statement via @entity108 saying the ' behavior will not be tolerated ' ' reprehensible ' : the university 's president , @entity106 , said investigations were underway and warned this behavior would not be tolerated shut down : national president of @entity14 , @entity88 , took to @entity108 to say the fraternity chapter had been closed and called on the university to expel the students involved ' in addition , all of the members have been suspended , and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked permanently			1
' we apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video , and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way			0
' furthermore , we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds , cultures and ethnicities			0
' timing : while the @entity14 members were chanting , president @entity6 was addressing crowds in @entity9 , @entity29 , on the 50th anniversary of the civil rights marches there anniversary : the sickening chant was made exactly 50 years after the march for civil rights led by dr @entity149 , center above , from @entity9 to @entity151 , @entity29 @entity14 has more than 200 chapters across the country , 15,000 undergraduate members and around 200,000 alumni			1
the mission of @entity14 is ' to promote the highest standards of friendship , scholarship , and service for our members based upon the ideals set forth by our founders and as specifically enunciated in our creed , @entity166			2
' for more than half a century , new members are required to memorize and recite the following : ' a true gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety , and whose self - control is equal to all emergencies ; who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty , the obscure man of his obscurity , or any man of his inferiority or deformity ; who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another ; who does not flatter wealth , cringe before power , or boast of his own possessions or achievements ; who speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy ; whose deed follows his word ; who thinks of the rights and feelings of others , rather than his own ; and who appears well in any company , a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe			0
' @entity106 , president of the @entity1 , said that the @entity1 had launched its own investigation into the video			0
@entity14 ’s national headquarters has closed its @entity102 chapter at the @entity1 following the discovery of an inappropriate video			1
in addition , all of the members have been suspended , and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked @entity219 apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video , and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way			2
furthermore , we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds , cultures and ethnicities			0
this type of racist behavior will not be tolerated and is not consistent with the values and morals of our fraternity			0
we have more than 15,000 collegiate members across the nation , and this incident should not reflect on other brothers because this type of hateful action is not what @entity14 stands for			1
this is absolutely not who we are			0
we teach our members to serve as role models in their communities and to live up to our creed , “ the @entity166			0
” when members fail to do so , we will not hesitate to take corrective actions or to impose sanctions			0
any behavior that is not aligned with the conduct we expect is unacceptable			0
equally unacceptable is bystander behavior of members who fail to intervene when they witness conduct that deviates from our beliefs			0
“ i was not only shocked and disappointed but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video , ” said @entity88 , the fraternity ’s national president			2
“ @entity14 is a diverse organization , and we have zero tolerance for racism or any bad behavior			0
when we learned about this incident , i called an immediate board meeting , and we determined with no mental reservation whatsoever that this chapter needed to be closed immediately			0
i am proud of my fellow board members because we mean what we say			0
” alumni who serve on the chapter 's house corporation board and who serve as advisers are appalled by the video and the song that was sung in it			2
they do not condone offensive and hateful behavior and will hold accountable the men who participated in the incident			0
although @entity14 regrets the closure , we believe members must be held responsible for their actions			2
we are hopeful that we can re-establish the @entity102 chapter at some point in the future with a group of men who exemplify our beliefs and who serve as leaders on campus and in the community .			1
