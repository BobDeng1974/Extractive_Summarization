by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson if @entity2 win the league on saturday there will be no open top bus ride through the city the following day to celebrate			1
such has been the fatalistic sense of failure that has clouded the second half of the season the absence of a proper celebration seems fitting			0
the players , manager , directors and supporters gave up on the league long ago			2
if they win it this weekend it will be by default and after receiving the trophy in the stadium immediately after the match many will leave the city the following day to head to @entity25 training camp destinations			0
@entity2 will win the title through a better head - to - head record if they beat @entity30			1
a draw would be good enough for @entity30 to win their first title in 18 years			1
head - to - head 21 august : @entity30 1 - 1 @entity2 ( @entity44 ) 28 august : @entity2 0 - 0 @entity30 ( @entity44 ) 11 january : @entity30 0 - 0 @entity2 ( @entity45 ) 1 april : @entity2 1 - 1 @entity30 ( @entity46 ) 9 april : @entity30 1 - 0 @entity2 ( @entity46 ) if @entity30 win it , no - one will get any sleep in the @entity50 capital for the following 48 hours			1
@entity30 's ticket allocation for the game is only 447 but they will more than make up for it once back home in the early hours of sunday morning			0
the very different celebration plans reflect the way the same title means very different things to these two teams			0
the @entity60 will fire their coach @entity61 whatever happens on saturday			0
goalkeeper @entity63 will join @entity64 regardless			0
@entity65 will follow him to @entity66 signing for @entity67			0
defender @entity33 will join incoming new manager @entity69 's coaching staff and the club will look to fund a big summer of transfers with the sale of at least two more top players			0
@entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 are all available at the right price and while it 's unlikely all four will leave , at least two must go to fund offers for a list of new signings headed by @entity87 's @entity86			1
they may even try to persuade to take @entity75 and @entity78 in exchange for @entity86			1
support : @entity30 fans will celebrate for 48 hours should they win their first @entity45 title in 18 years the events of saturday will change none of these plans			1
@entity30 in contrast may have a very different summer depending on how their next two matches go			2
winning the league and @entity46 double could double their resolve to keep key players and increase the desire of those players to stay			2
there will be offers in the summer for @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 - currently on loan at @entity109 but very highly rated – but coach @entity110 will demand that all stay and if he wins both @entity45 and the @entity46 his hand will be stronger			2
battle : @entity113 vies for the ball with @entity106 in their @entity46 clash last month stripes : @entity26 , who is poised to join @entity87 , takes on @entity2 's @entity117 earlier this season trophies will also help @entity30 attract a better class of replacement for @entity26 , who looks @entity87 bound			1
they could even make the headstrong striker dig in his heels and demand to stay in @entity50			0
@entity26 has scored against every club in @entity45 this season apart from @entity2			1
on saturday he will have former @entity2 favourite @entity124 alongside him – now public enemy no 1 after his wild celebrations in the @entity44 at the start of the season			0
how those two fare against a @entity2 defence that is likely to welcome back @entity117 after his cracked pelvis may well be the key to the game			0
if @entity30 get themselves in front few can see @entity61 's side scoring twice against them to win the game and the league			1
@entity45 has been decided on the last day before – most recently in 2010 when @entity139 's @entity2 pipped @entity141 's @entity140 .			2

@entity2 will win the title if they beat @entity30 at the @entity32
fans and players of @entity2 had given up on winning the league
@entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 will leave in the summer
@entity30 are bidding for their first @entity45 title in 18 years
