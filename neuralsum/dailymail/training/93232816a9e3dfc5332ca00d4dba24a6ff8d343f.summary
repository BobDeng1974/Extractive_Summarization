jews were the target of a brutal and systematic ethnic cleansing during the lifetime of @entity5			0
as part of fanatical , religious persecution it was proclaimed by @entity51 and @entity52 in march 1492 that all @entity26 should be expelled from @entity36			2
this move was particularly aimed at the 800,000 jews who refused to convert to @entity55 and were given just four months to leave the country			0
the remaining @entity26 in @entity36 fell into two groups : the ' @entity58 who embraced @entity55 and renounced @entity60 - and the ' @entity61 ' , meaning swine , who feigned conversion but secretly continued with their own religious practices			1
in search of a safe haven ? an illustration of @entity5 setting foot on @entity17 soil for the first time ... but was he looking for a new @entity26 homeland ? question of faith : the @entity28 tortured tens of thousands of @entity61 , who were ordered to give up the names of others - including friends and relatives the @entity28 tortured tens of thousands of @entity61 , who were ordered to give up the names of others - including friends and relatives			1

the scholars believe he left intriguing clues to his true religious background when he died , @entity96 reported			2
five provisions discovered in @entity5 's last will and testament , signed by the explorer on may 19 , 1506 , point to him being @entity26 , the scholars argue			1

his famous voyage was funded not by the @entity51 of @entity36 , but by three prominent @entity26 - and it was them who he updated first on the progress of his quest			2
he also left an undisclosed amount of money to support the crusade of liberating the @entity124 , as well as leaving funds to a jew who lived at the entrance of the @entity147			2
perhaps the most intriguing clues are within @entity5 's signature itself , the scholars claim			2
the explorer used a series of dots and letters - formed in a triangular shape - resembling inscriptions found on gravestones of @entity26 cemeteries in @entity36 , which he ordered his heirs to use			1
