by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 14:18 est , 22 march 2013 the killing , starring @entity2 as @entity3 , has inspired a raft of new @entity6 crime drama oh @entity3 , grim - faced wearer of woolly jumpers and top cop of unremitting gloom and doom , what in the name of @entity3 have you started ? remember detective inspector @entity3 ? she was the morose star of @entity3 , the @entity15 police drama called @entity3 back home that became a big hit in the @entity6 and elsewhere			1
over three gory series we thrilled to dense plot - twists and turns			1
got slapped around the chops by shoals of giant red herrings			1
found ourselves oddly entranced as the endless rain fell on a murky @entity27			1
in this watery flume of despair , @entity3 was distinguished not just by depressed @entity3 in her hairy jumpers but also by its bleak landscapes , noir - ish tone and eerie , jangling background music			1
now there has been a slew of copycat killings - not on the streets of the @entity15 capital this time , but across @entity6 television channels			1
over recent weeks our small screens have been invaded by a squad of equally grim - faced detectives determined to out - gloom @entity3			1
new whodunnit shows such as @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 ) and @entity50 ( also @entity49 ) have all featured crime - solving cops competing to see who can be the most lonely and enigmatic obsessive on the case - and on the planet			1
you know what they say			1
one moody and troubled cop is a coincidence			2
three is the future of police procedural - based drama in this country for the next ten million years			1
inspired by the killing and other @entity67 tales of murder most foul , such as @entity69 and @entity70 , the shows have several characteristics in common			1
there is the same kind of spooky music			2
the same kind of lakes being dragged			2
the same dread feeling that underneath the surface of a tight - knit and ostensibly happy community , something horrible lurks			2
in some instances , the cops even have the same kind of woolly jumpers			2
one important thing - and it has to be said before we can move on			2
although inspired by @entity3 , none of the @entity6 series actually features a female detective in charge of the whole stabbing and shooting match			1
perish the thought ! that might be taking things too far , guv			2
next thing you know , they 'll be wanting to wear trousers and make arrests instead of brewing us a nice cuppa and typing up the witness statements			2
and that 's just not on			2
in @entity46 , @entity106 ( @entity107 ) has just been passed over for the top job by @entity109 ( @entity110 )			1
in @entity48 , @entity111 ( @entity112 ) plays second fiddle to @entity114 ( @entity115 )			1
she wears a duffel coat and is so dizzy she ca n't remember how to read suspects their rights properly			2
@entity50 has no central detective character in the traditional sense , but does have @entity121 ( @entity122 ) , a policewoman who has just left the force to concentrate on being a mother and raising her family			1
even though she knows she is a better cop than her cop husband			2
that 's got to hurt			2
like @entity3 , these women must keep their real feelings hidden as the murderer continues to elude their grasp and they negotiate the blizzard of bleak			1
@entity107 and @entity110 star in @entity47 's new crime drama @entity46 , but @entity0 is peeved about @entity110 being @entity135 's boss so in the meantime , let us sift through the evidence , beat up the suspects in time - honoured tradition and ask the big question			1
out of all the new killing - lites and killing - alikes , whodunnit best ? most will say it is a clear win for @entity46 , the suspenseful eight - part @entity47 drama with @entity110			1
as @entity109 , he has been deployed to a @entity149 seaside town to solve the murder of 11 - year - old @entity151 , whose body was found on the beach under the dramatic honey cliffs of the @entity155			1
it was meant to look like an accident , but moody @entity109 smells a rat			2
is he a @entity3 - a - like ? well , he never smiles			2
he is a study in low - grade grump and is rude to everyone			0
friends or lovers ? none that we know of			0
all we know is that @entity168 happened on a previous case			0
@entity109 has panic attacks every time he thinks about it			0
his eyes are huge and black , oscillating above his velvety beard			0
there are moments when he looks like a troubled vole			0
a vole who says things like ' everything matters now ' with his mouth in a thin , white line			0
he is awful to @entity106 , who keeps crying and giving him fish suppers and cups of tea			0
this week she lost it and threatened to ' p * * * in a cup and throw it at you ' when he was a bit disrespectful			0
then she invited him for dinner with her family			0
i wish she 'd make up her mind			0
suspects ? everyone from @entity199 looking shifty in a caravan to the owner of the newsagent 's where @entity151 had a paper round			0
nearly eight million people tuned in for this week 's episode , which was tightly plotted and gripping despite the amusing smorgasbord of vastly different @entity208 accents			0
however , one important point			0
surely @entity211 's pivotal relationship with the murder victim - her son was his best friend - would have meant that she was taken off the case ? the same thought occurred when the constable in @entity48 - i mean both the two - part series and the eponymous island it is set on - discovered the body of his granny outside her cottage			1
instead of being sidelined into investigating a mitten found on a railing in downtown @entity227 , he just carried on working on the case			0
is that even allowed ? meanwhile , @entity48 the drama was so @entity3 - inspired it has even been nicknamed the @entity231			1
@entity115 strode around the treeless landscape , looking uncannily like @entity233 and shouting at suspects in a macho way			0
old men would cower at the sound of his boots and say things like : ' ah 've no left ma croft all night ! ' however , i loved the dignified and thoughtful way he spoke to a bereaved mother in a scene at @entity246			0
all too often the police are portrayed as one - dimensional brutes who care only about making a collar			1
@entity251 to see the other side for a change			0
@entity254 has a nice selection of phlegm - coloured woollies that @entity3 would approve of			0
and when it comes to interior emotion , he has a great way of letting anguish wash across his face that is as @entity15 as a flitch of bacon			0
inner torment ? i 'll say			0
a dead wife and troubled teenage step - daughter ? that will do nicely			0
on @entity48 , @entity115 , centre , plays di @entity114 , and his second - in - command is ' @entity272 ' , played by @entity273 , right , who @entity0 complains ' is so dizzy she ca n't remember how to read suspects their rights properly ' his sidekick @entity278 also wore shapeless jumpers - the colour of dried mustard , yuk - and said things like ' professor @entity283 has been telling porky pies '			1
while @entity48 was perhaps the closest to the @entity285 - ideal , @entity50 certainly caught the downbeat , suffocating mood			1
shown by the @entity49 over five days last week , it centred on the murder of @entity288 , a 14 - year - old village @entity50 queen			1
creepy and confusing , it starred @entity122 as retired cop @entity121 , smart enough to suspect the murderer from the beginning			0
but it was a struggle for the rest of us to know what was going on			0
a bird 's nest clue ? a psychopathic @entity298 ? a man whose wife had turned his shed into a pottery workshop ? there was witchcraft , erectile dysfunction and slo - mo shots - though these elements were not put together , thank goodness			0
the ending might have been rather unsatisfactory - without giving anything away , how did she know ? - but @entity50 had terrific ensemble acting , morally complex characters and depth			1
in the worlds of @entity46 , @entity48 and @entity50 , nothing is ever what it seems			1
and just as in their @entity319 noir counterparts , emotions are always deep - frozen , eyes never meet and the jumpers are always scratchy			0
yet while each of these dramas held fast to the gloomy prototype , they were never quite as brilliant , as depressing or as startling as the originals			1
we need a @entity3 of our own for a start			0
how long must we wait before we get one ?			0

@entity46 , @entity50 and @entity48 are all new @entity6 crime dramas **...**
**...** but no police women take the lead in any of their murder cases
