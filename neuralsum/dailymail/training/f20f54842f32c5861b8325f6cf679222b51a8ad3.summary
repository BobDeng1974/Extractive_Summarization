he would later need life saving treatment @entity64 then flagged down the cabs and they were joined by eight or nine of their friends who attacked the four with fists and feet			0
@entity1 was seen to stride into the fray and egged the others on before sprinting to the boot of her car with @entity64			1
judge @entity96 said : ' immediately she was joined by @entity64 who seconds later ran to the fight now armed with a baseball bat			0
' that bat then to some extent superseded the physical violence that was taking place without weapons			2
there was some pushing , punches and kicking but the bat took central stage			0
