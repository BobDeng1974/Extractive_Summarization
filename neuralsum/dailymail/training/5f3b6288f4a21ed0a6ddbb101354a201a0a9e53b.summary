@entity1 forward @entity0 does not usually struggle to find the back of the net and there is plenty of evidence to support this claim			0
@entity0 currently tops the all - time leading goalscoring charts for his club ( 391 ) , @entity9 ( 269 ) and the @entity10 ( 75 , including five hat - tricks )			1
in 2012 , he set the @entity13 record for most goals for club and country in a calendar year with 73 , while in 2013 , he achieved the unique feat of scoring in 33 consecutive top - flight matches			0
based on this , it should come as no surprise that the 27 - year - old is a four - time winner of @entity26 's @entity25			0
@entity0 currently holds the goalscoring records for @entity1 , @entity9 and the @entity10 in 2012 , @entity0 set the record for most goals for club and country in a calendar year , netting 73 times however , @entity0 has struggled to score when playing in @entity34 with just two goals in 10 games yet , for all @entity0 's incredible numbers , there is one freakish anomaly - his apparent hoodoo when playing in @entity34			1
ten times @entity0 has lined up against @entity34 teams on @entity34 soil , but he has only managed to score twice , with @entity1 failing to win six of those games			1
given his tallies elsewhere , the return is comparatively modest and a peculiar aberration amid an otherwise inspiring c.v			0
. @entity1 face @entity50 in the @entity10 round of 16 on tuesday and it will be interesting to see whether @entity0 can overcome his @entity34 curse , or whether the torrid run can continue a while longer			1
@entity0 's two goals in @entity34 came against @entity56 in the 2011 @entity10 final at @entity58 and through a penalty against @entity50 the @entity60 in the competition 's round of 16 last term			2
so far this season , @entity0 has scored 37 goals in 37 appearances for @entity1 and @entity66 against @entity50 on tuesday , @entity0 will hope to improve upon his underwhelming @entity34 record			2

@entity0 is one of the most accomplished goalscorers in world *football*
he tops the all - time scoring charts for @entity1 and @entity9
@entity0 is also the all - time top scorer in the @entity10
yet , his return when playing in @entity34 is more modest
the forward has scored just twice in his 10 games on @entity34 soil
@entity1 face @entity50 in the @entity10 on tuesday
