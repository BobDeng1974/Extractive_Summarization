by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:34 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 08:54 est , 26 september 2012 as tensions rise in the replacement referee debacle in the @entity5 , some comedians ca n't help but have a laugh at the expense of the @entity5 's inept officials			1
the videos have been tearing up the internet as uproar grows over the replacements and what has been seen by analysts and former players as unbelievable blown calls			1
one of them borrows the sample from @entity20 's summer anthem whistle , with a parody video of the same name			1
' the song is the latest catchy parody from @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , the same group that gave the world ' @entity55 ' ( to the tune of @entity57 ) at the height of the @entity60 rivalry between swimmers @entity61 and @entity63			1
and speaking of @entity57 , the @entity65 tune is the basis for yet another song poking fun at the replacement refs			1
' call it maybe ' features the lyrics : ' hey , i just met you / that play was crazy / what ’s his number ? / i ’ll call it maybe			0
' says it all : two replacement referees came up with two opposite calls after @entity82 receiver made a catch in the end zone monday night			1
most observers say a @entity87 defender had the ball first botched : the referee on the left called the play a touchdown for @entity93 , even though most fans believe @entity87 had intercepted the ball			0
the ref on the right called for a stoppage of play the song was written and performed by @entity101 , and first played on the @entity102 in @entity103 , @entity104 last week			0
across the league , players admit the state of play has changed under the referees who are n't as observant and lack the authority of the full - time officials			1
the controversy appeared to hit its breaking point on monday night , when the @entity82 beat the @entity87 on the final play of the game that was highly questionable			0
@entity87 guard @entity115 was especially furious , tweeting : ' got f * * * ed by the refs			0
thanks nfl ' and ' f * * * it @entity5			1
. fine me and use the money to pay the regular refs			0
' fury : @entity125 coach @entity124 screamed at officials last monday when they would n't allow him to contest a penalty ' these games are a joke , ' @entity129 quarterback @entity128 tweeted			1
' i love this league and love the game of football , but tonight ’s debacle hurts me greatly			0
this is not the league we ’re supposed to represent , ' @entity137 quarterback @entity136 wrote			0
even president @entity141 took a break from his presidential duties to weigh in on the debate , saying via @entity145 : ' @entity5 fans on both sides of the aisle hope the refs ' lockout is settled soon			1
' the situation has gotten so bad that team coaches are also being hit with punishments over their response to what they perceive as a blown call			2
@entity125 coach @entity124 was fined $ 30,000 on monday and defensive coordinator @entity158 $ 25,000 for verbal abuse of the officials during a monday night game against @entity162 on september 17			2
outrage : @entity87 players surrounded a referee after they were ' robbed ' of a victory against the @entity82 on monday angry : @entity87 guard @entity115 was not the only player who publicly complained about the replacement referees -- but he was likely to most explicit more fines are likely for @entity170 head coach @entity169 and @entity172 offensive coordinator @entity171 , and perhaps for others after a comedy of errors this past weekend			2
@entity124 and @entity176 were hit for their sideline histrionics , particularly when @entity124 was told he could n't challenge a call of 12 men on the field - he was correct that he could challenge , although replays showed the @entity125 were guilty			0
before grabbing the arm of an official , @entity169 wanted to know why @entity187 kicker @entity186 's field goal was called good in @entity187 's 31 - 30 victory sunday night			0
he could n't tell from his angle on the sideline , @entity169 claimed			0
' so when the game was over , i went out and i was really looking for an explanation from the officials as to whether the play was under review , ' he said , ' and i did try to get the official 's attention as he was coming off the field to ask that , but i really was n't able to do that			2
' penalties : @entity170 head coach @entity169 will likely be fined after he grabbed a replacement official and demanded to know why a @entity187 field goal was called ' good ' watch videos here			2

videos with music from @entity20 and @entity65 poke fun at @entity5 officials who are *accused* of blowing numerous calls in the last few weeks
parody videos come amid uproar over the replacements and fines for coaches who have verbally abused them from the sidelines
