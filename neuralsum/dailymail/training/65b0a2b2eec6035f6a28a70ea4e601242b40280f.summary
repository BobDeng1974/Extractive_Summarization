you do n't normally expect to be in the middle of a scrum at an event in aid of a charity			0
a nightclub or student disco maybe , but not at a charity ball			0
but that 's exactly what happened to me this week – when i attended a ball in aid of the @entity14 at the @entity15 in @entity16			1
the very genteel @entity15 is one of the most beautiful sports clubs in the country , built in 42 acres of the most prime real estate in the world , just south of @entity16 down near the river , but i did n't realise what the exact nature of the event was at first			1
but i rarely read the instructions on anything , so it came as a bit of a surprise when i walked through the door and i was surrounded by about 200 very excitable young women , all of whom wanted a selfie			0
everywhere i went there was a cluster of well - spoken girls in @entity50 waving smartphones at me			2
@entity28 managed to pose for one picture alone outside the event @entity28 posed for endless selfies with his fans when arriving at the ball @entity28 says that the ball was filled with well spoken girls in black dresses you can see from the video below the sort of numbers in the herd of young girls			1
what is the collective noun for a group of teenage girls ? a ' giggle ' of girls i believe			0
clearly i was more than happy to accommodate as they all asked very politely but it felt like i was lost at sea with the crowd choosing where i went			0
@entity28 posed for further pictures in the back of a @entity80 taxi which was converted into a photo booth the event helped to raise over £ 20,000 for the charity for health and safety reasons the organisers ended up putting me in a specially designed @entity80 taxi which had been converted into a photo booth , and it seemed like an hour passed by having girls ( and occasionally some boys ) ushered in and out of the taxi			1
but deep down i loved the attention – and they were all really charming and polite , i simply could n't refuse and i think it 's fair to say that anyone who asked for an picture got one , and in some cases five or six			0
and of course the most important thing was the event raised over £ 20,000 for the very good cause of the @entity14 , protecting vulnerable children all over the @entity105 , and preventing abuse			1
