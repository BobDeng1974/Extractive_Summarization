by @entity0 published : 06:32 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 10:20 est , 31 january 2014 honeymoon murder suspect @entity2 has lost his @entity4 bid to block his extradition to @entity6 until he is fit to stand trial for allegedly organising his wife 's murder			1
a panel of three judges , headed by lord chief justice @entity12 , ruled today that it would not be ' unjust and oppressive ' to force him to leave @entity13			1
they said this was on the basis that the @entity6 authorities agreed to send him back to the @entity13 swiftly if he is found unfit to stand trial , which has been agreed to			1
@entity2 , who is compulsorily detained in hospital under the @entity20 , is accused of ordering the killing of his new wife @entity22 , 28 , who was shot as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of @entity26 in november 2010			1
today @entity22 's family welcomed the ruling but it is understood @entity2 could launch one final appeal to the @entity30 to stop the extradition			1
suspect : @entity2 has been detained under the @entity20 because of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder his lawyers have stressed at various hearings that he will be willing to defend himself at trial once he is fit to do so , but they say he is unfit to plead under @entity52 law and his ' prognosis is not certain '			1
so far three men have been convicted over mrs @entity56 's death			0
@entity6 @entity57 was convicted of premeditated murder for shooting her			2
prosecutors claimed he was a hitman hired by @entity2 to kill his wife , which @entity2 has consistently denied			1
taxi driver @entity63 was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing and another accomplice , @entity66 , also pleaded guilty to murder and was handed a 25 - year prison sentence			0
@entity22 ’s father @entity69 , fighting back tears , said today : ' since she was taken from us , life has been practically unbearable			0
i do n’t know how we have managed to carry on			0
' but the fact that we need @entity2 to explain what happened on the night she was murdered has driven us each and every hour			2
' i feel no joy whatsoever at today ’s decision			0
but i do thank the judges and the @entity13 courts for being absolutely fair and proper in considering all the details '			1
mr @entity86 , speaking from his home in @entity84 , @entity85 , added : ' i have said all along that i will be happy to go to @entity6 with my arm around @entity89 ’s shoulder and support him			2
' if he is innocent , i will accept that			0
' claims : prosecutors claim @entity2 hired a hitman to kill his wife , which @entity2 has consistently denied the judges were asked to decide whether a person who is unfit to plead is ' an accused ' for the purpose of the @entity100 ' if he is being extradited in circumstances where he may remain unfit to plead '			1
they were also asked to rule on whether it was ' unjust or oppressive to extradite a person who is agreed at the time of the determination to be unfit , whatever the prognosis '			2
@entity2 's family have said that he remains committed to returning to @entity6 ' when his health would permit a full trial and when appropriate protections are in place for his health and safety '			1
a lawyer for the @entity6 government said it was ' delighted ' with the court 's ruling and expected it would be able to give the undertaking , but needed 14 days ' for final clarification '			2
@entity123 footage taken from the couple 's honeymoon hotel in @entity6 shows the final hours of @entity56 who was murdered in 2010 lord @entity12 said : ' it might be unjust and oppressive to order the return of a person who was agreed to be currently unfit and where there was a prospect that he might remain permanently unfit without considering whether an undertaking should be required from the requesting state			1
' he added : ' the circumstances of this case are such that we consider , on the findings made by the district judge , it would be unjust and oppressive to return him without such an undertaking			0
' the effect of the undertaking would be that ' in the event of the appellant ( @entity2 ) being found unfit to be tried , he will be free to return to the @entity13 , unless there is found to be a realistic prospect of his being tried with a year - or other stated reasonable period - of that finding and the trial takes place within the period '			1
lord @entity12 continued : ' in any event the appellant must be free to return in the event a court in @entity6 , having found him unfit to be tried , embarked on the process of determining under the @entity157 1977 whether he did the act			2
' he concluded : ' if such an undertaking was given , then it would not be oppressive or unjust			0
' guilty : taxi driver @entity63 ( pictured ) was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing @entity163 , a first cousin to @entity22 , said on behalf of family members at @entity165 's @entity4 : ' we are happy with the judgment			0
we have waited for it for three years , three months			0
' he said : ' it seems a step closer to finally getting justice for our @entity22			0
' but he warned there was still a possibility that @entity2 could launch a last - ditch appeal over today 's ruling to the @entity30 , the highest court in the land			1
mr @entity163 said : ' we are always worried and do n't take anything for granted			0
' he described the situation for @entity22 's parents as ' immensely difficult - they do not have normal life any more			0
' he added : ' they just want the truth - that is all we have ever wanted			0

judges say it is not ' unjust and oppressive ' to force him to leave @entity13
but only if @entity6 agree to send him home *quickly* if ' unfit for trial '
