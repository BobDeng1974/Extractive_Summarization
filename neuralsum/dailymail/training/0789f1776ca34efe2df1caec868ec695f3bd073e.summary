a former @entity1 commander decorated by the @entity2 has condemned the ‘ jobsworths ’ who stopped him volunteering to man the phones in a tiny village police station			0
@entity7 , 74 , who during his distinguished police career was in charge of protecting @entity10 as head of the @entity12 , said he only wanted to help out his local community support officer in @entity14 , @entity15			1
but despite obtaining support for his application from a former head of counter-terrorism at the @entity20 , he was turned down by @entity21			1
decorated : @entity7 and wife @entity22 on the day she was made a @entity23 mr @entity7 was told that he and his wife , a former @entity24 press secretary who also applied for an unpaid role , failed the vetting process because they had lived abroad for a while before moving back to @entity29			1
‘ it ’s a jobsworth thing , ’ mr @entity7 told @entity30			2
‘ we ’ve given a lifetime of service to @entity2 and country and i think it ’s sad that they have these silly rules			0
‘ all we wanted to do was answer the phones and deal with the public over the counter , which would have given the community officer more time to patrol the streets			1
’ before being responsible for the @entity10 ’s security , mr @entity7 headed @entity45 during the 1981 riots and played a key role in the @entity20 ’s response to the @entity49 a year earlier			1
when he retired in 1997 after a career spanning 40 years , he was made a commander of the @entity23			1
yet all this , plus a glowing reference from @entity54 , who ran the @entity1 ’s anti-terrorist branch in the 1990s , could not sway the human resources department at @entity21			1
mr @entity7 ’s wife is @entity58 , 61 , a former press secretary to the @entity59 , for which she was made a @entity23			1
she also worked for the @entity20 for 14 years as a senior press officer and was vetted to work at @entity62 , the @entity63 and the @entity64			1
but like her husband , her application for the job in @entity14 was rejected			2
having joined the @entity20 as a 16 - year - old cadet , mr @entity7 spent the last seven years of his career running the elite squad charged with providing 24 - hour security for the @entity72 and @entity74 ’s diplomatic community			1
his work also saw him honoured with the @entity76			0
@entity21 claim they are only following the agreed vetting procedures ‘ all this counted for nothing because we failed the vetting at the first hurdle , ’ said mr @entity7			1
‘ we moved back to @entity29 last year having spent nine years in @entity83			1
‘ we may not have been resident in the @entity29 , but having lived in another @entity85 country with reciprocal arrangements it would have been quite easy to check that we had n’t attended any insurgent training camps in the mountains of @entity90			0
’ the couple were at a festival near @entity14 last november when they were handed a leaflet asking for volunteers to help the local police community support officer ( @entity96 ) run his office			2
‘ the idea was to get volunteers in to release him to patrol the streets , ’ said ms @entity58			1
‘ we thought we ’d be useful because of our backgrounds and it was a good way for us to get to know the community			0
we rang the @entity96 and he asked us to come in for a chat			0
’ while @entity96 @entity108 was delighted at the prospect of having such an illustrious duo joining his village crime - fighting team , he warned them they faced bureaucratic complications			0
however , the couple assumed they would not be insurmountable and posted their application forms to @entity21			2
‘ we then got another load of forms back from the human resources department , ’ said ms @entity58			2
‘ they wanted to know everything about our relatives , whether they had even the most minor of convictions			0
‘ they also wanted to know if there was anyone else living in our house			0
there was a diversity form , all sorts of things			0
i turned to my husband and said , “ i ’m losing the will to live here , @entity7			2
” ’ the application was supported by a reference from @entity54 , former head of the @entity20 's counter-terrorism unit mr @entity7 added : ‘ there were nine pages of it			1
i filled in fewer when i was vetted by the @entity145 for my work with the @entity72			1
‘ seriously , i was positively vetted to a level i would have thought warranted being able to answer a phone or deal with a member of the public visiting a police office			0
’ his wife continued : ‘ @entity54 had already agreed to be a referee for both of us			0
and our second referee was someone who actually worked for @entity21			2
‘ but having received @entity54 ’s reference , @entity157 said that because the second person had n’t seen us for a year we would need another one			2
‘ at this stage , we thought why should we put another friend through the bother if there was a strong chance we would n’t get through anyway ? ‘ so i said to human resources that i understood the residency demand would prevent us getting through and they said that was absolutely right			0
why they sent more forms back and asked for another referee is beyond me			0
‘ the point for me is this is putting process before people			0
why did n’t they apply common sense ? ‘ and what value is the @entity85 if a police force in the @entity29 ca n’t pick up a phone to the @entity180 in @entity83 to ask if we ’ve been behaving ourselves for the past three years ? ’ @entity21 said : ‘ although we do n’t comment on individual cases , we do follow the @entity182 ’ national vetting policy guidelines for all forces , which set out a minimum residency period in the @entity29 of three years immediately prior to any application for employment with the force			1
‘ however , any applicants who are told that they have been rejected on those grounds can always seek a review , which will be individually considered			0
