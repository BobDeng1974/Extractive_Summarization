she ’s not a sad , weak - minded , passive person ' in @entity50 , feminist campaigners , @entity97 , said the novel dangerously romanticises the idea that women can fix broken men and protested at the premier @entity104 , who runs campaign group @entity105 , said the story portrays an abusive relationship			2
she said that if readers consider @entity4 's behaviour out of context , it would appear extremely alarming rather than alluring			0
she said : ' is it romantic when somebody tracks your phone , when somebody knows where you live before you tell them , sells your only means of transport , or buys the company you work for ? ' how can you marry that with being romantic ? ' ms @entity104 , who is a consultant working to end the abuse of women , said that after reading all three books , she was left ' deeply concerned about the amount of domestic violence that was being romanticised and celebrated '			1
she added : ' the thing that i would say to people who are reading the books , who are going to see it , is , if he was n't rich and very attractive , would this behaviour be normal ? ' domestic violence campaigners in @entity33 and the @entity34 called for a boycott of the film when it was released last month because they believed it ' glorified ' and ' romanticised ' abuse against women the books , written by @entity144 , follow the sado - masochistic sexual relationship between the two protagonists , @entity148 billionaire @entity4 and demure student @entity4			1
ms @entity104 said the campaign group were not against the sexual nature of the book but there were other far more worrying themes in the novel ' we are not against @entity21 ( bondage , discipline , sadism and masochism ) , it is the other issues in the books and films which we say glamorise domestic violence			0
' i have spoken to people who have said that he ( @entity4 ) was abused as a child and that is why he is the way he is			0
' it is also very dangerous to suggest that people abuse because of their childhood and that women can fix broken men with enough love			2
