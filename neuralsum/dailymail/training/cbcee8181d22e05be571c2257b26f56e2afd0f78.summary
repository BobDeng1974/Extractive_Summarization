they are scared of vacuum cleaners and chase their own tails , but it seems dogs may be smarter than you think			1
@entity6 can sense whether a person is lying to them or telling the truth , according to a new study			1
dogs remember if a person is trustworthy and decide whether to follow their orders based on their opinion of the human , scientists believe			1
dogs keep track of whether people lie or tell the truth so they can work out which humans they can rely on , especially when it concerns food ( file picture ) the latest research , published in @entity26 , suggests that canines learn which people they can rely on , especially when it concerns food			1
it is common knowledge that if a person points at something , a dog will usually follow the instruction and run and sniff out what they are being directed towards			1
a team at @entity40 , in @entity38 , tested this theory on 34 dogs			2
firstly , a researcher pointed each of the animals towards a container which had food hidden inside , which they ran over to before eating the treat			0
in the second test , the same researcher pointed each of the dogs towards an empty container , which they dutifully ran towards			0
when the scientist tried to direct them towards a third tub , which had food inside , most of the dogs ignored the instruction			0
dogs will only follow orders , such as fetch , from people who have a track record of being trustworthy , research shows however , when a new researcher pointed them towards the container , they keenly did as they were told and found the treat			1
@entity72 , who led the study , said this means that dogs can use their experience of the human to judge whether they can be trusted			2
she told the @entity78 that she was surprised that the dogs ' devalued the reliability of a human ' so quickly			0
' dogs have more sophisticated social intelligence than we thought			2
this social intelligence evolved selectively in their long life history with humans , ' she added			0
@entity88 , a veterinary scientist who specialises in human - animal interactions at the @entity90 , said that dogs like their lives to be predictable			0
he said : ' dogs whose owners are inconsistent to them often have behavioural disorders			0

dogs can sense whether a person is lying or telling the truth , study shows
canines remember which people are trustworthy and follow their orders
@entity6 is socially smarter than *previously* thought , scientists say
