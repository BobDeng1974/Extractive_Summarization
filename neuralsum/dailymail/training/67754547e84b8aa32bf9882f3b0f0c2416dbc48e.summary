by @entity0 it is supposed to be the programme that showcases the best of @entity5 talent			1
but switch on @entity5 's @entity6 tonight and you might be puzzled by what you see			2
for six of the acts through to this year 's semi-final are foreign			2
and following criticism of the lack of home - grown talent , one of the contestants has admitted he understands the outcry			2
tonight will see nine semi-finalists – three of them foreign acts – compete in the first of five live semi-finals , ahead of the winner being announced in two weeks ' time			1
@entity26 magician @entity25 , whose act involves producing two white doves as though from thin air , says he understands viewers ' frustration about foreign acts in @entity33 among them is @entity26 magician @entity25 , whose act involves producing two white doves as though from thin air			1
all four of the @entity5 's @entity6 judges – @entity37 , 45 , @entity38 , 43 , @entity39 , 35 , and @entity40 , 42 , – voted him into the semi-final , following an audition that received a standing ovation			1
but as he prepares to perform live tonight , the 26 - year - old said he could accept the point of view that only @entity5 should be allowed to compete			1
@entity25 said : ' i totally understand and get that viewpoint			2
for me , @entity5 's got talent is literally the biggest talent show in the world			1
' all of these talent show originate in the @entity5			1
@entity5 's got talent is way bigger than @entity53			1
@entity26 's @entity6 is non-existent			0
' they tried it for one season and it was a failure			0
i figured this was the place to do it			0
i feel like a lot of people do n't realise the magnitude of the show			0
' the magician went on to say he realises there will be people who do n't vote for him based on his nationality			0
and he added : ' there 's nothing i can do about that			0
i came here to hopefully get some exposure , and that 's what i aim to do			0

and last year a dance duo from @entity112 won the praise of the judges , prompting criticism that the programme was lacking in @entity5 talent			1
but in the past show boss @entity37 has claimed foreign acts help push the @entity5 performers to do better			1
