a showdown over vaccinations has erupted in a @entity3 town after the mother of an 8 - year - old was told by her doctor that a new school district rule requires children to get a booster shot at too young an age			1
@entity11 was expelled from @entity3 's @entity12 last week after her mother @entity13 refused to let her receive the @entity15 booster , which protects against tetanus , diphtheria and pertussis			1
@entity11 said her daughter 's doctor would n't administer the shot , which is a new requirement of the @entity22 , because it 's recommended only for children over 10 years old			1
their doctor said @entity28 is simply too young for the booster , per @entity31 guidelines -- though @entity41 guidelines say children her age are old enought tdap boosters : @entity28 is one of a small group of kids who were vaccinated iwth @entity15 before age 4 , meaning she should be due for the booster before an age when its indicated for use and @entity31 guidelines back the doctor up			1
' if we give that @entity15 vaccination between 7 and 10 , we are using it off label , ' @entity3 pediatrician dr. @entity53 told @entity58			1
' so if we ca n’t use it , then we are the ones going to be held liable			0
' according to @entity61 , the @entity15 brand ' @entity15 is approved for use as a single dose in individuals 10 years of age and older			2
' and that 's what scares @entity11 , whose daughter is part of a small group of children who got their whooping cough vaccinations before age 4			2
' i believe in vaccinations , and that 's not the issue , ' she told @entity77			0
' the issue is an age - appropriate vaccination			0
' meanwhile , the school district has taken cues from the state -- which follows @entity41 guidelines that do allow for children @entity28 's age to get the booster -- in a bid to avoid whooping cough outbreaks			1
and the rule states that , until she gets the shot , @entity28 simply may not attend her school			0
' the only way that she will be back in school before age 10 is if the state makes an exception for my daughter and the other kids that are faced with the same situation , because i ’m not getting her that shot , ' @entity11 said			2
in the meantime , @entity11 is prepared to home school her daughter			2
she 's also started an online petition to get her daughter back in school			0
' it breaks your heart , ' @entity11 said			0
' but do i sacrifice her health , possibly , just to get her into that building ? '			0

third grader @entity11 was *kicked* out of her @entity3 school when her mother refused to give her @entity15 booster
her mother @entity13 said her daughter 's doctor *informed* them that the tetanus / diphtheria / pertussis booster is only for kids over 10
however , the school district has new regulations that require the booster despite @entity31 guidelines that say 8 is too young
