@entity0 have quashed reports in @entity2 that they triggered @entity4 defender @entity3 's £ 24million release clause			1
the 29 - year - old centre - half played in the @entity8 final extra time defeat against city rivals real in @entity10 on saturday			1
@entity3 was a mainstay for @entity13 's @entity12 champions last season and @entity15 were also interested			0
incoming ! @entity0 have triggered @entity3 's release clause of £ 24m at @entity4 key man : the @entity18 has been important for @entity13 during their @entity12 title last season @entity4 are attempting to cash in on a player who will be 30 in september			1
@entity22 coach @entity21 did n't pick the big defender in his @entity25 squad - a decision that has come as a surprise given @entity3 's recent performances			2
@entity29 has identified the heart of his defence as a problem area , particularly after the departures of @entity34 and @entity35 has left the squad devoid of numbers			1
@entity3 is enjoying a renaissance on the continent since moving to @entity40 three years ago			0
what a picture ! new boss @entity42 has identified central defence as a problem position at @entity45 @entity46 : @entity0 have joined a host of clubs in chasing @entity50 youngster @entity49 ( right ) he did move back to @entity22 with @entity51 in 2006 after ill - fated one - season spells with @entity53 and @entity54			1
@entity0 have also continued to keep tabs on @entity50 's @entity49 , who wants to leave the club over a lack of games			2
the 19 - year - old is highly thought of in @entity60 and is the source of interest from @entity64 clubs including @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			0
he is one half of the best central defensive partnership in @entity70 and if @entity0 do manage to land him they will have some player			2
think @entity74 in the @entity76 / @entity74 partnership in @entity78 ’s first spell at @entity67			0
@entity79 is @entity4 's @entity76 – the brave leader heroically throwing himself in front of shots , sliding into tackles and heading in set - pieces - while alongside him @entity3 is the cool head ; the perfectly positioned partner who often goes unnoticed because he barely puts a foot wrong			1
you do n’t need the dramatic lunge if you are always in the right place at the right time			0
most commentators in @entity2 believe @entity3 has been the best defender in @entity12 this season and no one can quite understand why both he and his @entity4 team - mate @entity95 have been left out of the @entity22 squad – all the better for @entity0 who will get a player who has rested throughout the summer having put in the season of his career			1
six times @entity102 faced @entity3 this season and the @entity105 failed to scored , played out of the game by the 29 - year - old who was consistently voted best defender in @entity22 before @entity109 helped bring him to @entity4 from @entity110 in january 2011			1
as well as being impeccable defensively he knows how to get forward and score important goals , giving @entity4 the @entity113 last season by notching the winner at the @entity115 against @entity116			2
the fact that his outstanding displays have caught everyone ’s eye this season extends to @entity2 coach @entity122			0
the @entity25 - winning manager enquired over the defender ’s international status			0
unfortunately for @entity2 , he had already played full internationals with @entity22 and ca n’t follow @entity127 in making the switch to @entity2 .			0

@entity4 trying to cash in on defender who is 30 in @entity131
@entity42 is in desperate need of defenders are @entity35 and @entity34 both left the club
