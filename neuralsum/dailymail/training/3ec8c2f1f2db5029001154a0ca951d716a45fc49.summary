by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 03:18 est , 21 november 2012 the @entity2 day care worker who left young children in her house while she went on a shopping trip to @entity7 was today sentenced to 80 years in jail after four of the children died and three others were injured when a fire started in her home			1
on tuesday , @entity15 jurors sentenced 24 - year - old @entity16 to 80 years in prison for the death of one of the children , 16 - month - old @entity21			1
she still faces charges related to the rest of the children			1
' nobody wins in this situation , ' the young victim â€™s ' great - grandmother @entity25 said after the sentence was announced			1
convicted : @entity15 jurors sentenced 24 - year - old @entity16 to 80 years in prison for the death of one of the four children that was killed in a fire at her home when she left them to go shopping ' my heart goes out to the @entity40 family and those precious mothers and fathers who lost their babies			1
' @entity40 , who was only a few years removed from her teens when she started her day care , worked alone most of the time			1
investigators said the february 2011 blaze happened when a pan of oil she had left cooking on the stove ignited while she was out shopping			1
the same jury that decided her sentence convicted @entity40 last week of one count of felony murder			2
the jury could have sentenced her to anywhere from five years to life in prison			2
prosecutors had sought a life sentence , while defense attorneys asked only that jurors not give her an excessive sentence			2
damage done : @entity72 , whose brother died in the blaze , shows off one of the burns she received on the fatal day she will have to serve 30 years of her sentence before she is eligible for parole			1
@entity40 also was ordered to pay a $ 10,000 fine			2
jurors deliberated her punishment for seven hours over two days and she had no visible reaction after the sentence was announced			0
@entity40 's attorneys contended she was a good person who loved children but made a terrible mistake			1
prosecutors argued she was an irresponsible day care owner who had doomed the children when she left them alone			1
they said @entity40 had repeatedly left kids she was responsible for unsupervised and it was only a matter of time before her actions led to tragedy			1
defense attorney @entity95 said he still believes @entity40 should not have been tried for murder because the deaths were an accident			0
' the sentence is not going to fix things			0
it 's not going to make anybody feel better later on			0
but the jury has spoken			0
that 's their sentence , ' @entity95 said			0
@entity40 's family and friends , who declined to comment after the sentence was announced , had testified she had changed since her troubled teenage years , when she had pleaded guilty to arson for starting two fires at her high school on the same day			1
defense attorneys had presented expert testimony to argue that a faulty stove or refrigerator may have sparked the blaze			2
prosecutor @entity118 said that while he has sympathy for @entity40 's family , she had nobody to blame but herself			0
unwavering : @entity40 , who has dual citizenship , fled to @entity124 after the fire and was only arrested after she returned to the @entity127 ' she was being paid to watch these children			1
she knew better , ' @entity118 said			0
' it 's not the stove			2
it 's not the refrigerator			0
it 's not any parents ' fault			0
it 's nobody 's fault but her own			0
' one of the surviving children , @entity72 , stood next to @entity118 as he spoke			2
@entity72 , whose 3 - year - old brother @entity140 died in the fire , showed reporters scars the fire left on her right forearm			1
@entity40 's attorneys argued she never intended to hurt the children , who ranged in age from 16 months to 3 years old , and whom @entity40 had referred to as ' her babies			2
' but prosecutors did not need to show she intended to harm them , only that the deaths occurred because she put them in danger by leaving them alone			0
under @entity2 law , a person can be convicted of felony murder if he or she committed an underlying felony and that action led to the death			1
support : the mothers - @entity163 on the left and @entity165 on the right - of two of the victims hug after @entity40 was sentenced to 80 years in jail for the death of 16 - month - old @entity21 in a victim impact statement @entity25 read in court after the verdict was announced , she told @entity40 the children were never ' your babies			1
' ' they do n't belong to you			0
they never did , ' she said			0
but @entity25 said that while she holds @entity40 accountable for what happened , she forgives her			0
after reading the statement , @entity25 went over to @entity40 's mother in the courtroom and hugged her			0
@entity40 fled to @entity124 after the fire but was captured after about a month , returned to the @entity127 in march 2011 and has remained jailed since			2
she was born in the @entity127 but has @entity124 citizenship			0
@entity40 still faces three more counts of felony murder in relation to the other children who died , and three counts of abandoning a child and two counts of reckless injury to a child in relation to the three who were hurt			1
of those charges , she may only go to trial for the more serious ones as prosecutors said they planned to pursue trials on the remaining felony murder charges but did not comment on the others .			0
