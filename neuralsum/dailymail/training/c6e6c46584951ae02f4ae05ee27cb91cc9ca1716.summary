by @entity0 published : 20:19 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 05:37 est , 14 march 2013 the man who secretly filmed the infamous ’ 47 percent ’ video of @entity3 has finally come forward and explained why he decided to wade into the presidential dogfight			1
@entity5 publicly admitted that he was the bartender who released the footage of @entity7 presidential candidate @entity3 speaking at a private fundraiser and he said that the motivating reason behind the move was so that all @entity11 could see the ‘ true ’ @entity3			1
‘ frankly the people that were there that night , they paid $ 50,000 per person for a dinner			1
i grew up in a blue collar area of @entity22 , ’ mr @entity5 said in an interview with @entity14 ’s @entity13			2
‘ there 's a lot of people who ca n’t afford to pay $ 50,000 for one night , for one dinner … i felt an obligation for all of the people who ca n't afford to be there			1
the day in day out struggles of regular @entity11 that guy has no idea and i do n’t think he will ever have any idea , ’ he said			0
mr @entity5 said that he brought a camera to the event because he was never told not to , and he told @entity50 that he was not the only one as a number of other staff members wanted to possibly have their picture taken with @entity3 after the event			1
mr @entity5 said that he had the camera set up behind the bar so that he could film his speech while tending to his bar duties , but once he realized that @entity3 ’s talk at that may fundraiser ‘ was n’t just any other speech ’			1
his attention was piqued when @entity3 walked into the room and quickly began ordering staff members around			2
even though his comments that the workers should speed up their service was likely in jest , that still rubbed mr @entity5 the wrong way			1
leaked : @entity71 , an opposition researcher , said he found the video online and put reporters from the left - leaning @entity11 website @entity75 in touch with an unnamed individual who had shot the footage woops ! the resulting outcry over @entity3 's remarks is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the @entity7 lost the race to the @entity84 ‘ i ca n’t imagine demanding to be fed faster to be served faster , ’ mr @entity5 said in an interview for @entity86			1
after that , @entity3 began talking about the military - style organization of a factory in @entity90 where one of his companies had outsourced some of its work			1
the former governor went on to describe how 12 young women were living in each of the small boarding rooms , in three - tiered bunk beds			0
‘ at this point i realized this was not your typical speech , ’ mr @entity5 said			1
mr @entity5 thought that @entity3 ’s views on the factory were the most outlandish , and reflective of what the candidate thought of practical work environments			1
‘ he just wandered through this horrendous place , and he thinks this is pretty good , ’ mr @entity5 said			2
reasoning : mr @entity5 , seen left being interviewed by @entity14 's @entity13 , said that he wanted to remain anonymous until after the election so that the focus stayed on the video and not on him ‘ he does n’t care about the people who are out of work in the @entity11 …			2
he ’s a vulture capitalist who just does n’t care on any level			0
’ from there , @entity3 went on to say the infamous remark that critically damaged his campaign : ‘ there are 47 per cent who are with him , who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you name it			2
that that 's an entitlement			0
and the government should give it to them			0
and they will vote for this president no matter what			0
' egalitarian : mr @entity5 said that he wanted the comments to be seen by all of the electorate , and not just those who paid $ 50,000 to attend the dinner once it truly hit home that this was not the average stump speech , mr @entity5 realized that his recording was potentially damaging to @entity3 ’s campaign and he needed to protect it			1
at one point , he tossed a towel over the camera to make sure that no one spotted it			0
at another moment , he readjusted it ’s position because a @entity167 agent was standing behind him			0
‘ i had no idea that it would be this big thing that it turned out to be , ’ he said			0
once he cleaned up the bar and the night ended , the portion that struck a chord with mr @entity5 was the comments @entity3 made about the @entity90 factory , where he recalled the site was fenced in with barbed wire on top - not to keep the workers in but to keep overzealous job applicants out			1
mr @entity5 said that if he decided to release the video , he wanted to make sure that he had the proper facts behind him so that it stood up against critical tests , so he began reading up on @entity3 's visit to @entity90 and the questions raised about the @entity186 factory that he toured			1
that research lead him to @entity188 , a journalist for liberal newsmagazine @entity75 , as mr @entity188 wrote an article about the factory			0
mr @entity5 reached out to mr @entity188 's assistant , @entity71 , and the group began to discuss the tape and the decision to publish it online			2
‘ people could decide for themselves whether they agreed with him or not but i thought it was my duty to make sure as many people saw it as possible			0
‘ i thought it could be a game changer , i thought maybe it could take him out			0
’ mr @entity5 said that he is a registered independent but tends to vote for @entity206 candidates , and that the major reason why he debated for two weeks about whether or not he should release the footage came from the inevitable threat of backlash from conservative supporters			2
‘ i had offers - @entity212 and this and that and the other as far away as @entity216 - and i thought it was absolutely the wrong thing to do			0
i thought that would change the topic of the conversation away from the subject to me , ’ he said .			0

@entity5 *announces* that he was the bartender who filmed the @entity3 comments during a $ 50,000 - per - plate fundraiser during the campaign
said that he realized after he set up the camera that the candidate was n't just giving his normal stump speech
felt that everyone should hear what @entity3 ' really feels '
