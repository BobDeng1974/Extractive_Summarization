a thoroughly deflated @entity0 described @entity2 ’s 2 - 1 defeat to @entity3 as the lowest point of his career			1
@entity2 are on the verge of elimination from the @entity8 thanks to @entity10 ’s deadly double in @entity11			1
for @entity2 to qualify they need @entity12 to win their final two matches while the @entity2 must also beat @entity14 in @entity15 and hope they have a good enough goal difference			1
video - scroll down to see fan reaction from both sides down and almost out : @entity0 has that sinking feeling after the defeat to @entity3 but @entity0 thinks @entity2 are almost certainly out , judging by his mood after the match in @entity11			1
' it ’s the worst feeling i have had as a player , ' the @entity2 centre - back said			1
' a few weeks ago this ( the @entity8 ) was one of the highlights of my career and a couple of weeks down the line it ’s one of the lowest points			2
' the next four days are going to seem like forever			2
we just hope that @entity12 can perform really well in the next two games and leave the last game to try and get a win and that ’s all we can do but we realise it ’s going to be very tough			2
' big moment : @entity0 ca n't prevent @entity10 smashing home @entity3 's winner despite having knee surgery just four - and - a - half weeks ago , @entity10 chased the @entity2 defence down all night			1
the controversial @entity45 striker sneaked in behind @entity0 to head past @entity46 in the first half and he wrapped up the win when he capitalised on a mistake by @entity50			0
@entity0 believes the @entity51 was very lucky with his second goal			1
' he has a lot of energy and he is a great finisher , but sometimes as a forward you get a bit of luck , ' the @entity54 defender said			0
' he took his first goal very well			1
for the second goal he was very , very fortunate			2
@entity64 hit the bar in the first half and the @entity66 forward went close with a curling free - kick			1
the centre - back is given a consoling pat on the head from @entity64 @entity70 's nemesis @entity10 consoles a dejected @entity2 captain @entity50 @entity2 had other chances to clinch the win , and @entity0 believes the team were unfortunate to lose			1
' i thought we gave a good account of ourselves , ' said @entity0 , who won his 26th cap on thursday			0
' i have played in teams a lot worse than this and come away with wins			0
' @entity46 ( @entity82 ) came off and he said to me that he has had five or six shots on target to deal with over the two games and we have conceded four goals			0
it ’s very tough to take			0
sometimes football can be cruel			0
' meanwhile , @entity90 knows a remarkable turn of events are needed if they are to avoid becoming the first @entity2 side since 1958 to crash out at the @entity8 group stage			1
@entity2 boss @entity95 gathers his thoughts while coach @entity97 ( second right ) watches the action ' there ’s a small chance but we are not exactly expecting something like that , ' the centre - back said			1
' we have to go out there and give a good performance against @entity14			0
' we had them on the back foot			2
i ’m not sure what went on with @entity113 ’s penalty appeal , and we had a couple of chances , but obviously we just were n’t able to get that second goal			2
' it it is a similar story to the @entity12 game			0
we played pretty well but not good enough			0
' asked to sum up his feelings , @entity90 added : ' @entity121			0
we played so well again in spells			0
stunned : @entity123 was left reeling after @entity3 scored their first goal ' it did n’t go our way with @entity50 ( @entity50 ) flicking the ball on , and you just hope that he mishits one , but he hit the target and they win the game			2
' we ’ve not seen it again , but as a defender that ’s the last thing you want to see			0
a punt down the pitch , a flick - on and a goal			1
' as you can tell by my voice , everyone is absolutely devastated			0

@entity2 centre - back could n't prevent @entity10 scoring twice
@entity64 's goal was n't enough to avoid a second @entity149 defeat
