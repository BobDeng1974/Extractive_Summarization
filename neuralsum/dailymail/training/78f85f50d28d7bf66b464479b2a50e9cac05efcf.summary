’ family bonding : hunting , stuffing and mounting their trophies is a hobby the @entity39 all share - and everyone plays their part in the process hunting hobby : @entity15 , 61 , taught himself to do taxidermy in the 70s and turned his hobby into a family business to fund hunting trips around the world happy hunting : it is down to son @entity17 , 19 , and @entity15 to hunt down the animals the @entity39 use for trophies father to son : after bringing home the prey , @entity17 skins the animals before he starts working on the taxidermy process with his father perfection : @entity17 inspects the horns on an impala shot in @entity95 , while his mother @entity16 finishes off another exotic trophy to add to their $ 400,000 collection @entity15 is a self - taught taxidermist who has hunted , stuffed and mounted over 4,000 animals			1
he began mounting in the late 70s , teaching himself taxidermy by picking up road - kills and experimenting with different methods to be able to mount his own hunting trophies			1
the hobby has turned into a business and the family taxidermy company help pay for their own trophies			2
@entity15 and son @entity17 will normally go out hunting together and bring the trophies home			2
@entity17 then skins the animals , @entity15 stuffs them and @entity16 does the final preparations and make sure the animals retain their lifelike looks			2
