as the home of the @entity2 for almost a thousand years @entity0 has become a symbol of peace and harmony			2
but now the tranquility of the @entity9 's @entity8 home is set to be shattered by sound of an extra 1,700 night flights which will give royal residents a rude awakening from four o'clock in the morning			1
plans drawn up by the @entity15 could see hundreds of night flights diverted away from the homes of 110,000 residents of the west @entity19			1
@entity9 's home : there could be an extra 1,700 night flights over @entity0 which will begin at 4am but the price of quieter nights in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 will be more noise for the 15,000 people living in the @entity0 area , including the @entity9			2
disruption : the planes flying overhead are a ' private matter ' for the queen and considering 90 per cent of arrivals land between 4.30am and 6.00am the plans look set to disrupt the @entity9 's peace			0
@entity0 mp @entity38 , has called on residents to resist			1
the @entity40 mp told the @entity41 : ' i am particularly concerned by this latest proposal , which could have a truly detrimental impact on the quality of life of @entity0 residents , and i would urge residents to make their views known			1
' the @entity9 spends most of her private weekends at @entity0 as well as taking up official residence there for a month over @entity52			2
she also spends a week there in june , when she attends @entity54 and the service of the @entity56			0
but a @entity57 spokesman told the @entity58 the issue of night - time disruption at @entity0 was a ' private matter for the @entity9 '			2
the @entity15 ( @entity62 ) hopes to divert 1,670 flights away from approaching over @entity19 and passing over @entity0 instead			1
under existing rules @entity64 is allowed 5,256 incoming scheduled night flights a year			0
there are also a small number of unscheduled departures which means @entity71 have to put up with nearly 16 planes passing overhead every night			0
the majority of incoming night flights - 72 per cent - approach @entity64 over the built - up boroughs of west @entity19 , with the remaining 28 per cent passing the @entity0 area			1
night flights : more planes used by @entity79 and other airlines will fly over @entity0 under the proposals but the ( @entity62 ) is now considering ordering pilots to approach from the west thereby avoiding the more heavily populated area , unless a tailwind of five knots or more makes this impractical			1
this would increase the flights passing over @entity0 from about 1,470 to about 3,150 every year			2
the potential winners of this strategy are the 245,000 @entity71 who claim they are affected by the noise			0
@entity93 , chairman of the @entity94 , which campaigns against aircraft noise , yesterday told the @entity58 : ' many people in west @entity19 will clearly benefit if this change went ahead but it would be at the expense of many more sleepless nights for the people of @entity0			1
' a ( @entity62 ) spokeswoman told the @entity58 diverting the approach path for night flights was ' just one option ' being examined			0
she said : ' the government recognises that noise disturbance from aircraft flying at night is the least acceptable impact of airport operation on local residents			0
' at this stage we are gathering evidence on what might be feasible and have taken no decisions yet on our preferences			0
we will be consulting on specific proposals later this year once we have assessed the evidence received from this consultation			0

rude royal awakening from four o'clock in the morning as 110,000 sleepless residents in west @entity19 may see flights diverted over @entity8
@entity0 mp urges residents to fight the proposals
