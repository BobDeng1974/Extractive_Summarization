by @entity0 last updated at 11:47 pm on 13th february 2012 @entity1 became the seventh in the nation to legalize same - sex marriage , even as opponents of the measure signed by governor @entity7 monday vowed to prevent the law from ever taking effect			1
the measure , which won approval from state lawmakers last wednesday , remains essentially on hold for a standard 90 day waiting period , meaning gay couples ca n't begin to walk down the aisle in the northwest state just yet			2
opponents of the statute have promised to seek its repeal through a ballot measure at the polls in november that could delay enactment further or halt it entirely			2
the issue is also likely to figure in the state 's @entity26 presidential politics			2
signed into law : gov @entity7 celebrates with supporters after legalizing gay marriage in @entity1 still , the bill - signing marked another key victory for gay rights advocates after a federal appeals court declared a voter - approved gay marriage ban in @entity36 unconstitutional last week , and the @entity37 approved a same - sex marriage bill earlier on monday			1
@entity39 , a @entity40 and a @entity41 , signed @entity1 's measure to raucous applause during a ceremony in the ornate reception room of the @entity47 statehouse			0

several dozen protesters , including members of the group @entity57 , stood silently in the @entity58 overlooking the reception hall holding signs with slogans declaring that marriage is meant to be ' one man , one woman			0
' @entity26 @entity66 candidate @entity65 , a staunch conservative and outspoken foe of same - sex marriage , was making two stops in @entity1 on monday to galvanize support for the @entity26 caucuses there on march 3			1
@entity72 states : the states in red allow same - sex couples to marry			1
@entity36 briefly allowed gay marriages until a referendum that banned them			2
the issues is currently in the courts allowed then stopped : @entity81 issued gay marriage licenses in 2004 , but then was stopped from the practice after court rulings he was to meet with @entity26 lawmakers in @entity47 in the afternoon , then give a speech in @entity88 on monday night			0
anticipating the repeal campaign that lies ahead later this year , the governor added , ' i ask all @entity92 to look into your hearts and ask yourselves -- is n't it time ? ... we in this state stand proud for equality			0
' democrats , who control both legislative bodies in @entity47 , accounted for in 2004 , @entity102 became the first state to legalize same - sex marriage in the @entity105 as a result of a ruling by the state @entity108			1
@entity110 was the second state to make gay marriages legal after a state @entity108 ruling in 2008			1
the @entity114 overturned a ban on same sex marriages april 3 , 2009 , making them legal there			1
@entity118 became the first state to make gay marriage legal with a legislative vote after lawmakers overrode the governor 's veto april 7 , 2009			1
in @entity124 , lawmakers approved a same - sex marriage bill and it was signed by the governor june 3 , 2009			1
on december 15 , 2009 , the @entity129 city council voted to allow gay marriage			0
@entity131 became the most recent state to legalize gay marriage after a vote of the legislature in 2011			2
the lion 's share of support for the measure			0
the stage for swift passage of the measure this year was set after @entity39 , who is in her last term of office , said last month she would endorse such a law			0
several prominent @entity1 - based companies employing tens of thousands of workers in the state have supported the bill , including @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			0
opponents were led by @entity41 bishops and other religious conservatives			0
gay marriage efforts elsewhere supporters of same - sex marriage are pushing similar statutes in @entity160 and @entity161 , whose @entity162 - controlled @entity37 in @entity163 approved a gay marriage bill earlier on monday			1
@entity165 governor @entity165 has vowed to veto it if it reaches his desk			0
a referendum to legalize gay marriage in @entity171 has qualified for the november ballot there			1
six other states already recognize gay marriage -- @entity131 , @entity102 , @entity110 , @entity118 , @entity124 and @entity176 -- as does the @entity129			1
two of @entity1 's leading proponents of gay marriage , state representative @entity177 and state senator @entity178 , hailed the work of @entity47 's legislature			0
' years from now , our kids will look back and wonder what all the fuss was about , ' said @entity177 , who has four young children with his partner of 10 years			0
@entity178 , who has said he will marry his companion of nearly 20 years , added , ' my friends , welcome to the other side of the rainbow			0
' in the meantime , opponents of same - sex matrimony have said they would seek to overturn the legislation via one of two ballot measures -- a referendum for repeal or an initiative defining marriage as the exclusive domain of heterosexual couples			1
if a repeal referendum qualifies for the november ballot , the gay marriage law would be suspended until the certification of election returns in december , before it is either repealed or goes into effect			2
but qualification of a proposed initiative defining matrimony as restricted to one man and one woman would not , in and of itself , prevent gay marriages from proceeding under the newly passed statute starting on june 7			2
it remains unclear whether gay weddings performed in the interim would be nullified if an initiative were to pass in november .			1

opponents vow to take the issue to voters in november and have the law overturned
@entity102 , @entity110 , @entity176 , @entity118 , @entity124 and @entity131 allow same - sex marriages
@entity161 , @entity171 and @entity160 are considering measures that would allow gay weddings
