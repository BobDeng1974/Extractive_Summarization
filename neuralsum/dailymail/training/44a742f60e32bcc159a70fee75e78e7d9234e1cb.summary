by @entity0 @entity1 ignored direct police evidence of how blue - chip companies fuelled the illegal trade in personal information			1
a senior officer submitted documents outlining how a little - known three - year inquiry uncovered a nationwide network of corruption			1
the multi-million - pound investigation found law firms , debt collectors and insurers were behind the thriving underground trade			1
but despite holding eight months of gruelling public hearings at a huge cost to the taxpayer , @entity1 dismissed the officer ’s evidence in less than 18 minutes			1
to the point : @entity1 dismissed police evidence in just 18 minutes the revelation renews pressure on the @entity28 judge to explain why he ignored evidence of hacking and other illegal activities outside of the media			1
he is already under fire for refusing to consider an incendiary intelligence dossier compiled by the @entity36 ( @entity36 )			1
it included a list of 102 companies and individuals linked to a group of rogue private eyes who blagged , hacked and stole sensitive data			1
earlier this week @entity36 chairman sir @entity45 resigned after failing to declare a conflict of interests as the row over the list rumbled on			2
the move raised hopes that members of the home affairs committee will find a solution to the deadlock created by his refusal to allow its publication.last night , @entity51 shadow home secretary @entity50 said there was a growing sense of confusion and @entity36 ’s ‘ silence ’ can not continue			2
she said the crime - fighting agency had lost people ’s confidence and there were ‘ legitimate questions ’ over whether disclosing the names would be in the public interest			2
she added : ‘ we urgently need @entity36 to give clear answers to legitimate questions about its confidential list			2
’ evidence about the three - year inquiry was given by @entity78 , who was then an acting assistant chief constable for @entity79 and @entity80			2
listen up : evidence was given by @entity78 who was an acting chief constable for @entity79 and @entity80 in papers submitted to the @entity83 , he revealed how he and others uncovered evidence of a network of corrupt public officials			2
police officers , support staff , prison guards and benefits agency staff were all suspected of leaking confidential information to private detectives			0
they in turn were supplying corporate clients who were hungry for sensitive data that could not be obtained elsewhere			0
the inquiry , known as @entity99 , began after a member of public uncovered a building contractor ’s criminal record during a planning dispute			0
police suspected the information was obtained illegally and quickly discovered an illicit network handling private data			0
they found that the personal details of @entity111 , at that time chancellor , were checked on the @entity113			1
@entity79 and @entity80 alerted five other forces , including the @entity115 , as organisations including the prison service , benefits agency , @entity119 and mobile phone companies were targeted			0
the inquiry led to six men – two serving police officers , two retired officers , and two private detectives – being charged			0
but the sprawling case was thrown out of court in 2005 by a judge who said it had no hope of securing any convictions			0
in a remarkable comment , the @entity132 judge said he did not consider a pc passing private information to a former colleague as ‘ a serious matter that amounted to misconduct ’			0
mr @entity78 said that his inquiry nevertheless uncovered shocking evidence of how the illegal information trade went far wider than the media			1
he told @entity1 he ‘ never found any direct evidence or indirect evidence linking that information being requested by or for any part of the media or journalists ’			1
instead the clients were ‘ national companies , insurance companies ’ who were instructing investigations into civil claims , accidents and marriage disputes			0
the senior officer ’s evidence adds weight to criticism of @entity1 for focusing too narrowly on the media			1
@entity161 mp @entity160 , a member of the home affairs committee , has previously suggested that @entity1 could have adopted a broader remit			1
speaking last month about evidence contained in the suppressed @entity36 report , miss @entity160 said it could have changed the course of the inquiry			0
she said : ‘ i can not understand why they did not make these points to the @entity171 when the @entity83 terms of reference were being set in the first place			0
’ a @entity83 spokesman said : ‘ the terms of reference for the inquiry related to the culture , practices and ethics of the press and how they engaged with the public , the police and politicians			0
evidence on other issues was outside those terms of reference			0

investigation found law firms were involved in the underground trade
but despite coming at a great cost to the taxpayer , @entity1 dismissed it
already under fire for skirting over other interesting revelations
