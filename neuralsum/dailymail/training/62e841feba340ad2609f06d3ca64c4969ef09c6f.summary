the @entity11 @entity10 in @entity12 , @entity3 does n't allow negative @entity2 reviews for wedding guests

' please know that despite the fact that wedding couples love @entity12 and our inn , your friends and families may not , â€˜ says the website
since guests wedding guests do n't choose where they get to stay , the hotel does n't think they should be able to give a poor review
couples are charged $ 500 for every negative review and then refunded once the review is removed
