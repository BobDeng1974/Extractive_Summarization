by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 05:19 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 07:17 est , 13 november 2012 @entity3 has said he is too old to become the @entity5 ’s next director general after a lively appearance on the radio led to speculation that he was putting himself forward			1
the @entity11 presenter , 74 , took to the airwaves yesterday to attack the corporation ’s ‘ bonkers ’ bloated management system and its culture of ‘ gobbledegook ’			1
however , he also defended the corporation ’s ‘ dedicated and hard - working ’ rank and file staff during his appearance on @entity23 ’s flagship news show today			0
furious : veteran @entity3 has launched a bitter attack on the @entity5 and said it is ' over-managed ' by people who ca n't speak plain @entity27 his decision to give an interview yesterday was interpreted by many as an attempt by the presenter , who has once before applied to be director general and twice before applied to be @entity5 chairman , to ‘ throw his hat in the ring ’ to replace @entity39			1
but yesterday mr @entity3 told the @entity2 this was not the case			1
he said he would not be allowed to run the @entity5 anyway because , at 74 , he was above the age limit			0
asked if his interview on today was a thinly - veiled job application , he said : ‘ it was n’t			0
i ’m over the age barrier , simple as that			0
i ca n’t do it because of my age			0
’ mr @entity3 described the @entity5 as the ‘ greatest broadcasting organisation in the world ’ but added : ‘ what it has is a crisis of management of its own making			1
’ attack : mr @entity3 said that @entity39 lacked the ' stomach ' needed for the job and @entity62 should consider why he hired him in the first place he said ‘ committed ’ staff who serve the public faithfully have been ‘ betrayed by the management ’			1
the tv presenter compared the bureaucracy of the @entity5 with that of the @entity70 , saying they both are guilty of ‘ managers adding to management ’ and reducing the actual service			2
mr @entity3 added : ‘ in my opinion it is still over-managed and the management still speak gobbledegook ... ...			1
it ’s gone bonkers at that level			0
’ but said it was ‘ hyperbole ’ to describe the situation as the worst crisis in the @entity5 ’s history			2
mr @entity3 added he believed @entity39 had been given a huge £ 450,000 pay - off to get rid of him and that @entity86 chairman @entity62 should ' reflect ' on why he chose @entity87 in the first place			1
the @entity5 's biggest - ever internal crisis is entirely ' of its own making ' , he said			1
the presenter , who has been with the @entity5 for 50 years , has applied for the director general job in the past and his outburst has led to speculation he will take another run at it after @entity39 resigned after just 54 days in charge			1
he pointed out that @entity39 's previous title before his abortive stint as @entity101 had been head of ' vision ' rather than head of television			0
the presenter said the existing culture did not produce ' good director - generals '			1
' you get people who have played the game very carefully , one against the other ... they just do n't have the stomach for what is needed , ' he said			0
angry : @entity115 also blamed ' over-management ' at the @entity5 that started thirty years ago @entity3 said it would be ' absurd ' for @entity86 chairman @entity62 to resign over the controversy			1
but he added : ' i think he should reflect on why he chose @entity39			1
' writing in the @entity119 , @entity3 suggested the nature of mr @entity39 's departure demonstrated that he was not right for the job			2
' the fact that he chose to resign rather than fight shows that he was not the right choice for director - general			2
the @entity101 has to fight like a tiger to defend the @entity5 and @entity39 did not do that , ' he added			2
the trouble is that the @entity5 in recent years has throttled itself with its own bureaucracy - which saps the energy of its staff and demoralises them			2
' it is over-managed and badly managed so that no - one knows how or where decisions are taken			0
' the upshot is a crazy system where @entity39 as head of television , when told of the @entity141 suspicions , ends up saying that he does not want to show ' undue interest ' in something that clearly radically affects his programming			0
' meanwhile veteran correspondent @entity115 says the @entity5 can salvage its damaged reputation but also blamed ' over-management ' for some of its ills			1
' it may look good if more senior people resign , but the only effect it will have will be to make the people who take their place more timid			0
if it happens , it will be a cop - out			0
what is required is a change in the way @entity157 and current affairs , and perhaps other parts of the @entity5 , are controlled , ' he said			0
' @entity160 has been a serious blight on the @entity5 since the @entity161			2
the proliferation of middle managers in the @entity5 was something that @entity62 wanted to deal with ; but the decisions about who should be sacked were all too often made by middle managers			2
in spite of everyone ’s best intentions , the real weight of the savage cuts that have been imposed on the @entity5 since the licence - fee agreement of 2010 has fallen on the programme - makers and broadcasters			0
' in the past @entity176 would never have thought of contracting out something as important as the investigation of a child - molestation scandal to an independent company ; it would have been done in - house , by people who adhered to the @entity5 ’s own standards			0

the @entity11 presenter says it can not produce good director generals with the ' stomach ' for a fight
@entity3 could be a *candidate* to be next director general and says @entity5 is suffering its biggest ever internal crisis - ' of its own making '
' it has gone bonkers ' mr @entity3 said , adding @entity62 should : ' reflect on why he chose @entity39 ( @entity87 ) '
@entity115 says the @entity5 can salvage its reputation but they must crush ' blight ' of ' over-management '
