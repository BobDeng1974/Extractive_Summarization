an urgent expedition will leave tomorrow to probe a giant crater that has appeared in gas - rich northern @entity2			1
@entity5 aerial images show a mysterious hole which experts say may be up to 262 feet wide , in the @entity8 of northern @entity9			1
' a scientific team has been sent to investigate the hole and is due to arrive at the scene on wednesday , ' @entity10 has reported			0
there has been web speculation about the crater indicating ' the arrival of a @entity35 craft '			1
but one @entity9 expert says the cause is more likely to be global warming releasing gases under the surface , which then explode like a champagne cork			1
experts say that the darkening around the inner rim of the crater indicates ' severe burning ' which scorched its edges			0
another theory is that the hole was formed by a meteorite striking this lonely spot in the @entity52 , some 20 miles from the @entity54 gas field			0
' there is agreement that soil around the hole was thrown out of the crater , large enough for several @entity61 helicopters to fly into it , ' @entity10 reported - before adding ' not that they have			1
' the expedition organised by the @entity8 authorities includes experts from @entity9 's @entity66 of the @entity67 , and also the @entity68 of the @entity69			2
very remote : the crater has appeared in @entity8 - a part of @entity2 whose name translates as ' the @entity29 ' search for answers : expedition teams are on their way to the site , hoping to work out the cause of the crater the mysterious hole is in the @entity52 , some 20 miles from the @entity54 gas field they plan to take samples of soil , air and water from the scene			1
they will be accompanied by a specialist from @entity9 's @entity91			2
a spokesman for the ministry 's @entity8 branch has ruled out a meteorite , but says it is too early to say what caused the hole			0
' we can definitely say that it is not a meteorite , ' he says			0
dim and distant : @entity8 is a corner of @entity9 far removed from the cities of @entity104 and @entity105 a place far far away : @entity8 is is @entity9 's main production area for gas supplied to @entity109 barren : gas pipelines run through @entity8 - but otherwise , in many places , there is little sign of life mysterious : one more outlandish theory suggests that the crater has been caused by the landing of a @entity35 @entity118 from the @entity119 , thinks the crater was formed by a mixture of water , salt and gas igniting an underground explosion , a result of global warming			1
gas accumulated in ice could have mixed with sand beneath the surface , and then mixed with salt			0
some 10,000 years ago this area was a sea			0
who knows ? scientists are hoping to announce their findings as to the cause of the hole in the next few days global warming may have caused an ' alarming ' melt in the under - soil ice , released gas and causing an effect like the popping of a @entity148 bottle cork , ms @entity118 suggests			2
@entity8 , a large peninsula jutting into @entity67 waters , is @entity9 's main production area for gas supplied to @entity109 .			0

enormous crater appears suddenly in part of @entity9 whose name translates as ' the @entity29 '
teams of scientists are *rushing* east to *fathom* the cause of this *unusual* - and rare - *geographical* *occurrence*
one especially outlandish theory talks about a @entity35 landing as a possible cause of this *colossal* chasm in the earth
