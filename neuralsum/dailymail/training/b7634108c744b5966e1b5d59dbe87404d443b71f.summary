two new lizard species have been discovered after living for millions of years in a remote rainforest area of far north @entity2			1
a @entity4 researcher , dr @entity3 , came across the @entity5 and @entity6 on an expedition to the rainforest plateau on top of the @entity10 , 170 km north of @entity11 in december last year			1
dr @entity3 said the two species were hidden in the isolated range , a virtual mountaintop fortress cut off from the surrounding area by piles of huge granite boulders			1
@entity19 was discovered for the first time in december last year @entity21 is the lizard specie found by dr @entity3 on his last expedition dr @entity3 flew into all three expeditions by helicopter to the rainforest plateau on top of @entity10 @entity10 is a 10 hour drive from @entity28 the lizards have been officially named and described in the latest edition of the international journal @entity32 , taking the tally of new animals discovered during dr @entity3 's three trips to @entity10 during to a remarkable five			1
last year 's expeditions to the plateau also found three other unique species : a boulder frog in february and a leaf - tailed gecko and a golden skink in march			1
this incredible find prompted international headlines describing @entity44 as host to a ' lost world ' of animals isolated by a freak of geography			0
dr @entity3 said that description was perfectly justifiable			2
' the @entity10 has been sitting there completely isolated from other rainforest areas for millions of years			2
it 's truly remarkable , ' he said			0
' it probably has more unique animal species per unit area than anywhere else in @entity44			2
' dr @entity3 told @entity58 that the main reason the species had not been discovered until now was because the range was difficult to get to			1
dr @entity3 said although it was rare to find five species in less than a year - he expected more discoveries the new boulder frog was discovered on dr @entity3 's first visit in february last year dr @entity3 reached all three expeditions in @entity10 by helicopter last year			1
' it takes about 10 hours by car from @entity28 to get there but when you get there it 's very hard to climb - i tried a couple of years ago , ' he said			0
' the area has also been overlooked because the area looks like it 's very small			0
' although dr @entity3 said it was rare to discover one specie let along five in less than a year - there may well be other discoveries to come			2
' we are looking in detail at another lizard that could also be new			0
and the invertebrate and plant collections made during the surveys are still being assessed by experts , ' he said			0
' this is on top of three vertebrate species that were discovered there in past decades			0
so that 's eight animal species that are found only at @entity10 , making their entire world distribution about the size of inner @entity98			0
' the scientific names of the two new lizards - @entity101 wundalthini and @entity103 - were chosen by the traditional owners of the @entity10 region in collaboration with dr @entity3			2
the @entity10 surveys were funded by the @entity108 , @entity109 and the @entity110			0
dr @entity111 found the leaf - tailed gecko on his second expedition the golden skink was the other discovery on his trip in march last year			1
