by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:02 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 06:24 est , 6 october 2012 the slaughter of a @entity4 family in the @entity5 could be linked to money found hidden in a @entity8 bank account			1
the cash was in the name of @entity13 engineer @entity11 , 50 , and his dentist wife @entity14 , 47			0
the couple died in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire that also killed mr @entity21 ’s @entity20 mother - in - law , @entity22 , and @entity23 , a passing cyclist			2

money found in bank accounts belonging to the family has now been seized the couple ’s two young daughters survived the attack , although the elder was seriously injured			1
detectives admitted this week they were still baffled by the motive for the attack close to @entity29 , in eastern @entity40 , on september 5			2
but @entity42 prosecutor @entity41 is working on the theory that the secret bank account is linked with the quadruple murder – and that mr @entity21 may have been in a @entity8 bank shortly before the slaughter			1
last night a source close to the case speculated that the ‘ sizeable amount of cash ’ could provide the key to the killings , and that mr @entity21 could even have had large sums of money from the account on him when he was killed			1
one report from @entity42 suggested that mr @entity21 had visited the bank shortly before he was killed			1
victim : @entity11 , 50 , was murdered near the village of @entity28 , near @entity29 , in the @entity61 region of @entity40 alongside his wife and mother - in - law @entity8 is just an hour ’s drive from where the massacre took place , in an isolated layby on the outskirts of the village of @entity28			1
mr @entity41 , who was appointed by @entity5 investigators , believes the entire family may have been returning from the @entity42 city when the ambush took place			1
the @entity76 were shot repeatedly in the head and body as they sat in the family ’s @entity80			2
the bank account seized in @entity8 was once in the name of mr @entity21 ’s recently deceased father , @entity84			1
mr @entity21 has been said to have been involved in a dispute with his elder brother , @entity86 , 53 , over their father ’s will			2
while @entity90 was an engineer on satellite and electronics projects , @entity86 works for the @entity93 , a golf and leisure company , at its head office in @entity96 in @entity13 , close to where he owns a home			0
the brothers are joint owners of the family home , worth about £ 1million , in @entity102 , @entity13 , although @entity86 moved out about a year ago , around the time their father died in @entity104			2
a legal document appears to show that @entity90 had attempted to block the terms of his father ’s will being carried out			0
and the engineer had told a childhood friend he had cut links with his older brother after ‘ underhand things ’ took place over their late father ’s estate , the family is said to be worth many millions , with reports of further properties in @entity104 , @entity40 and @entity120			1
@entity86 has not spoken publicly about the tragedy but has been interviewed by police on a number of occasions , each time denying he was in dispute with his brother			0
poignant : cyclists ride past flowers left at the scene of the killing outside the nearby village of @entity28 concern : the @entity21 's home in @entity102 , @entity13			2
speculation still surrounds the motive for the shootings in which three members of the family died it has emerged that colour photographs showing the @entity76 minutes before the attack have been found by detectives inside the family ’s @entity80			1
all were taken in front of a picturesque house covered in flowers outside @entity147 , a town close to the village of @entity28			0

her seven - year - old sister , @entity155 , was badly injured , suffering serious head injuries and a bullet wound in a shoulder			0

detectives fear all were drawn into a suspected ambush by one or more professional hitmen on the outskirts of @entity28			0
as 100 officers on both sides of the @entity174 struggle with the case , @entity29 prosecutor @entity171 said on thursday : ‘ we ’re investigating everything but it all takes a lot of time , trying to piece together the lives of all the people who have died			0

money seized after investigators discovered bank accounts linked to @entity21 family in @entity8
speculation that account could be worth £ 5 million has been dismissed by @entity42 prosecutors
photos also found showing family *enjoying* *holiday* in @entity40 shortly before they were attacked
