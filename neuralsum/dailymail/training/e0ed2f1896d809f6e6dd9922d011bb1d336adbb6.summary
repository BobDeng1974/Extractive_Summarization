by @entity0 published : 13:03 est , 2 july 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 3 july 2013 drink - drivers who blow only marginally positive in a breath - test are to be stripped of their statutory right to a second - chance blood or urine test under a new @entity7 legal crackdown			1
the controversial measure aims to counter ' delaying tactics ' by drunk motorists who play for time and exploit legal loopholes to escape conviction			1
a new @entity14 put before @entity15 today removes motorists ' statutory right to a second - opinion blood or urine test where a breath test reading is just above , but close to , the legal limit			1
the @entity14 will close the loophole allowing those testing marginally positive in breath - tests to play for time to sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken - thus escaping prosecution this will close the loophole allowing those testing marginally positive in breath - tests to play for time to sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken – thus escaping prosecution			1
it is part of a package of measures to crack down on drink and drug drivers unveiled as part of the new @entity14			2
road safety minister @entity43 said the new @entity14 will ' streamline enforcement against drink - driving			2
' he said a quarter ( 25 per cent ) of drink - drive suspects who opted for a blood test at police station where there is no on - hand doctor managed to get off			2
overall some 1 in 12 ( 8 per cent ) of those arrested for drink - driving currently opt for a second chance blood test			2
a @entity56 spokesman said : ' this will close a loophole which allows those testing positive in breath tests to sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken			1
currently , drivers who record less than 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath have the right to demand a blood or urine test - despite being over the legal limit of 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres ' to speed up enforcement process , the government will also legislate to allow police the option not to perform a preliminary breath test where roadside ' evidential ' breath tests are carried out			1

this is known as the ' statutory option ' and dates back to the original introduction of breathalyser technology when there were concerns over reliability			0
a @entity56 spokesman said : ' in his review of drink and drug driving , sir @entity90 recommended the removal of the right to demand a blood or urine test as evidence showed people were using it as a delaying tactic			1
the government also believes that improvements in the accuracy of breathalyser technology means that this option is no longer necessary			0
' the new @entity14 also removes the requirement for a preliminary breath test where roadside ' evidential ' breath testing is used			1
currently , when a suspected drink - driver is pulled over by police , they undergo a preliminary breath test at the roadside and are then taken to a police station for a further ' evidential ' test whose results can be used in court			1
this will be dependent on the imminent introduction of new advanced and more sophisticated mobile roadside ' evidential ' breath test devices which police can use on the spot			1
these evidential roadside breathalysers are not currently in use but are expected soon to receive approval by the @entity124 ahead of their widespread ' roll - out ' , say ministers			0
the @entity56 spokesman added : ' at the moment results from the evidential test taken at police stations are the only ones able to be used as evidence			0
' under the new @entity14 , once mobile evidential testing devices are deployed , the police could perform the evidential test at the roadside so the preliminary test would not be required			2
' similar roadside test devices for drug - drivers are also in the pipeline awaiting approval			0
more than 1,500 people a year are killed or seriously injured in drink drive incidents and 50,000 drink drivers are convicted each year			0
some 280 people were killed outright in 2011 – a 12 per cent rise			0
road safety minister @entity43 said : ' we have made great progress in tackling drink driving but last year 280 people died in accidents where the driver was over the limit and we are determined to tackle this irresponsible minority			0
' mr @entity43 added the measures would make enforcement ' easier and less bureaucratic ' adding : ' these common sense measures reflect advances in equipment used by the police and will make our roads safer by ensuring drink drivers are taken off the road			0
' breathalyser devices have been used by police for drink - drive screening since 1967 and as evidence for about 30 years since 1983			0
the new @entity167 also paves the way for a wider range of registered healthcare professionals given the power to take evidential blood samples in hospitals and to assess whether a driver may have a condition due to a drug			0
the aim is to reduce pressure on hard - pressed doctors .			0
