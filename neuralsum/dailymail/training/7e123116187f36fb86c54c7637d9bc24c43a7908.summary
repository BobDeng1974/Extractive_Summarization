a year that promised so much has unravelled and left @entity1 with nothing other than cause for regret			1
the return to the @entity6 was supposed to propel @entity1 back into the big time but their feeble exit at the group stage , with just five points and five goals to show for their six matches , has been like slipping from heaven into hell			1
here , @entity15 looks at the key dates during 2014 that have seen @entity1 's fortunes plummet			2
@entity19 ' season with @entity1 has unravelled and left them with nothing other than regrets april 20 : @entity23 2 - 3 @entity1 to think this was just eight months ago			1
having beaten @entity23 3 - 2 , @entity1 moved to within seven points of lifting the title			1
@entity19 had challenged his side to smash through the 100 - goal barrier but , amid all that giddiness and euphoria , one key fact had been overlooked - @entity1 had automatically qualified for the @entity6			1
' it was an incredible victory and big congratulations to the players , ' @entity19 enthused			0
' we ca n't finish lower than third and that guarantees @entity6 football			2
' i do n't think anyone would have expected that			0
it shows the magnitude of the effort we have put in and the quality we have shown			0
' @entity1 striker @entity46 celebrates scoring against @entity23 during the 3 - 2 win in the @entity48 @entity1 captain @entity49 celebrates as his team win 3 - 2 against @entity23 on april 20 @entity19 was looking to orchestrate another @entity48 title charge this season with @entity1 june 27 : @entity53 arrives , @entity1 ready to sell @entity46 the key date in @entity1 's summer			1
having already brought in @entity55 , @entity53 becomes their most costly signing of the window on this day at £ 25million and they bid to sign @entity60 from @entity61			0
what is more significant , however , is the fact @entity1 come to the conclusion that they are ready to sell their talisman , @entity46 , to @entity66			1
the fee is good but the 31 goals he scored will not be easily replaced			0
@entity53 became @entity1 's most costly signing of the transfer window at £ 25m as they splashed out ex-liverpool striker @entity46 was announced as a @entity66 signing via this photograph during the summer @entity46 poses with a no 9 @entity66 shirt at the @entity76 , though he remained in a biting ban at this point @entity1 lost the proflic @entity46 when @entity1 signing @entity53 joined during the summer 's transfer window august 25 - @entity81 arrives @entity1 finally signed a headline - grabbing centre forward			1
@entity81 comes in at £ 16m and reveals his ambition is to win the @entity6 at @entity84			1
only three weeks earlier , though , @entity19 had ' categorically ' said @entity1 were not interested in the @entity85 and the move smacks of desperation after they had missed out on @entity88 and @entity89			2
on the same day , @entity90 put @entity1 in their place , comfortably beating them 3 - 1			1
@entity81 , laughing in the stands , has struggled to fill the void left by striker @entity95 's injury at @entity84 ankle ligaments - @entity96 vs @entity98 ( may 2013 ) ankle ligaments - missed nine games ( december 2013 ) thigh - during @entity96 training ( september 2014 )			1
missed six weeks calf - during @entity1 training ( october 2014 )			1
missed three weeks thigh - during @entity1 training ( november 2014 )			2
out for six weeks september 5 : @entity95 injured with @entity96 during an @entity96 training session at @entity105 , @entity95 – on whose shoulders there is great responsibility – damaged his thigh			2
it was an enormous blow for @entity19 , who needed the striker to take over @entity46 ’s mantle			2
he was expected to be out for four weeks but , almost three months on , he has not kicked another ball			0
with @entity114 out in the cold , @entity81 toothless and @entity55 ’s endeavour not enough , @entity1 ’s struggles revolve around their lack of threat			1
teams find them easy to play against			0
@entity95 has not played for @entity1 since august and will remain out until next year due to a thigh injury the striker first injured his thigh while on international duty with @entity96 earlier this season in september @entity95 scores for @entity1 during their 2 - 1 victory over @entity125 on the first day of the season october 1 : @entity127 1 - 0 @entity1 the return to @entity6 football had been tense and only a late @entity49 penalty had secured three points against @entity132			1
they had gleaned no confidence , however , and they were wretched in @entity134 , losing 1 - 0 to @entity127			1
their performance was as startling as their garish yellow shirts			0
with two games against @entity139 looming , @entity1 were on the back foot			2
‘ we came to win and i expected a win so it was very disappointing , ’ said @entity49			0
‘ we did n't deserve anything			0
we were too soft all over the pitch			0
it hurts to say they wanted it more			0
we were second best against an ok team			0
’ @entity147 scored the only goal of the game to seal three points for @entity127 in their @entity6 tie @entity1 suffered a 1 - 0 defeat against @entity127 in their first @entity6 away game since 2009 @entity1 ultimately paid the price for losing 1 - 0 in @entity127 before drawing 1 - 1 at @entity84 in the return fixture click here to read the match report november 23 : @entity158 3 - 1 @entity1 with the season threatening to go into freefall and none of the new recruits making a significant contribution , @entity1 go to @entity158 – scene of their implosion in the title race in may – needing a win to boost confidence levels before they head to @entity169 for a crucial game against @entity132			1
what they produce is something out of @entity19 ’ nightmares			0
@entity158 win 3 - 1 and @entity1 bear no resemblance to the free spirits they once were			1
‘ this is more than just a poor start – there 's something wrong , ’ says @entity176			0
‘ something is n't right			0
last year when they came here , we said they were mentally and physically weak			0
' @entity186 steps up to deliver the killer blow to @entity1 as the visitors lost 3 - 1 against @entity158 @entity1 goalkeeper @entity189 dives but can not save @entity186 's fine free - kick to beat the visitors 3 - 1 @entity158 captain jedinak scores the decisive free - kick in the dying minutes to seal the 3 - 1 win @entity158 players celebrate after going 3 - 1 up against last year 's @entity48 runners up @entity1 @entity1 players look gutted after they lost 3 - 1 on the same ground they let slip a three - goal lead last season click here to read the match report december 9 : @entity1 1 - 1 @entity127 ( out of the @entity6 ) they may have drawn the game but the result against @entity127 felt like the worst defeat of all for @entity19 and his team			1
@entity1 did not deserve to get through and their performance at @entity84 was a sorry footnote to a @entity211 campaign that started poorly and got progressively worse			2
they did not learn and everything looked like it was too much for them			0
@entity19 picked the wrong team in @entity139 , his defence could not hold out in @entity169 and failed to produce when it mattered			0
@entity1 have reached their lowest ebb			2
the problem for @entity19 , though , is it could yet get worse			0
@entity49 looks forlorn after the final whistle as @entity1 are knocked out of the @entity6 @entity220 cuts a frustrated figure in the @entity223 rain as @entity1 failed to get the win they needed @entity225 manager @entity19 looks dejected as @entity1 failed to create any meaningful chances in the first half @entity60 makes the slightest of contact with @entity231 's face as the @entity1 man is sent off @entity49 's free - kick gave @entity1 hope of sneaking a win with 10 men but they ultimately crashed out			1
