by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 28 may 2013 new research shows that taking statins could reduce the risk of painful arthritis taking cholesterol - lowering statins every day could more than halve the chances of getting arthritis , according to a new study			1
researchers at @entity9 carried out the research on the back of growing evidence that arthritis is not just down to wear and tear as the body ages - but also inflammation in the joints			1
the study of more than 16,000 adults found that people on the highest doses of statins – 18.5mg or more a day – had 60 per cent lower osteoarthritis rates than people not taking the drugs			2
as well as lowering cholesterol , statins have an anti-inflammatory effect , and are taken by eight million people to ward off strokes or heart attacks			1
they are also thought to protect against cancer and @entity30 ’s and ease the symptoms of multiple sclerosis and protect diabetes sufferers against heart disease			1
@entity9 ’s @entity35 , which is funded by @entity36 , found that people on very low doses seemed to be at higher risk of arthritis than patients not taking statins			1
the study , @entity43 and @entity44 in the general population : a @entity46 , which is published in the journal of general and @entity48 , said the findings suggest the condition may be more closely linked to heart disease than first thought			1
' our work has shown that the risk factors for cardiovascular disease are also associated with osteoarthritis , ' said researchers			2
' the co-occurrence of osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease is common			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity36 said : ' we welcome this study as it contributes to the idea that osteoarthritis ( @entity67 ) in not simply wear and tear as we get older , and that in the future drug treatments can offer hope to people with @entity67			0
' research suggests that arthritis may be more closely linked to heart disease than first thought ' @entity67 is an active disease that includes inflammation and active damage to the joint			1
' the concept that @entity67 is caused by the way that our body processes lipids is not proven , but this study provides some intriguing data to suggest that this warrants further work			0
' @entity36 is committed to finding the causes of @entity67 , new therapies for @entity67 as well as treatments , such as pain relief , that help to manage the symptoms of oa			0
' for example , we are funding a trial to investigate whether a drug called hydroxychloroquinone , commonly used to reduce inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis , is also effective for people living with @entity67			0
' scientists believe that inflammation plays a larger role in osteoarthritis than first thought			0
they are investigating whether drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis , which occurs when the immune system attacks the joints , can also help in osteoarthritis			0
around 10 million @entity108 suffer from arthritis			0
the charity arthritis care estimates the number of patients will rise to 17 million in the next 20 years .			0

statins are known have an anti-inflammatory effect
they can also protect against cancer , @entity30 ’s and ease the symptoms of @entity120 , diabetes and heart disease
now , research by @entity9 shows that those on high doses of statins have a lower risk of arthritis
