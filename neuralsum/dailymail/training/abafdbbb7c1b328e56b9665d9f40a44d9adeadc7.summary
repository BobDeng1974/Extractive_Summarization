a new @entity1 documentary has confirmed suspicions held by the @entity4 administration that there is a second @entity7 whistleblower leaking government intelligence			1
the revelation reportedly comes during a major scene of @entity11 , a documentary made by director @entity12 that follows the former government contractor from before he leaked thousands of classified documents last year through to the present day			1
according to @entity16 , @entity15 - the journalist who first brought the @entity1 files to public attention and @entity12 ' reporting partner - is the one who reveals the news on - camera to @entity1 , whose mouth gapes open in shock			1
@entity15 - who now runs website @entity25 , launched in the wake of the @entity1 scandal , from @entity28 - attended the film 's world premiere alongside @entity12 in @entity31 on friday night			1
shocked : @entity32 by filmmaker @entity12 - one of only two people @entity1 ( pcitured ) trusted with his stolen government documents - reveals a second leak giving out secrets from within in @entity7 team : journalist @entity15 ( left ) and filmmaker @entity12 ( right ) were contacted via encrypted email in early 2013 by someone calling themself ' citizen four ' saying they were about to blow the whistle on secret government su , who turned out to be @entity1 critically acclaimed : @entity11 is a new fly - on - the - wall documentary ' thriller ' that gives a new insight to @entity1 support : filmmaker @entity12 ( center ) attends the premiere of her documentary , @entity32 , in @entity31 on friday night , flanked by the parents of @entity1 , @entity54 and @entity55 in august it was revealed the government suspected a second leak after a story that was published by @entity25			1
@entity60 reported at the time that the proof was in documents obtained for the article about @entity65 government surveillance of suspected terrorists , which is dated august 2013 - months after @entity1 fled first to @entity68 and then to @entity69 to escape spying charges			1
in addition to @entity25 's report , two articles in the @entity73 press had reported on @entity65 national security and spying issues without citing @entity1 - adding to the theory that the notorious whistleblower is not the only leak			1
' that 's particularly notable given that virtually every other article using @entity1 documents - including der @entity84 - specifically identified him as the source , ' @entity15 said in an email to @entity87 in july			1
@entity15 says in @entity11 that the person is higher in rank than @entity1			1
however nothing else is known about the second leak who is providing secrets to journalists			2
the @entity94 also said the government has a list of one million names collected on a database called the @entity99 ( @entity100 )			0
it claimed there was one watchlist with 680,000 names on it that are under surveillance by the government			0
the site said that 40 percent of the people have no affiliation to terrorist groups			0
@entity12 says in her documentary that she is on the list			2
the list has basically doubled since the underwear bomber plot to destroy a @entity116 - bound airliner on christmas day in 2009			0
the justification for this is that the would - be bomber , @entity119 was not on any watchlists at the time that could have had a chance of preventing the attack			0
concern : president @entity4 and his administration were already convinced there is a second source leaking government secrets to journalists @entity1 is wanted in the @entity65 under the @entity130			1
he now lives in @entity69 , where he was granted a three - year residency			0
@entity1 , @entity15 and @entity12 spent eight days holed up in a @entity68 hotel room nutting out the first stories that revealed @entity1 to the world , all of which is covered in @entity11			1
@entity1 did not tell anyone what he was doing when he abruptly left the @entity65			0
he told his girlfriend , dancer @entity138 , with whom he lived with in @entity139 , that he was going on a work trip			0
love : dancer @entity141 , the girlfriend of @entity1 , has been reunited with him in @entity69 together again : @entity32 also revealed that @entity1 's girlfriend @entity141 , a pole dancer , has now joined him in @entity69 at the time @entity12 was several years into making a film about surveillance in the post- 9/11 era when she started receiving encrypted e-mails from someone identifying themself as ' citizen four ' , saying he was about to blow the whistle on @entity65 government surveillance programs			1
@entity15 was also contacted , and in june 2013 he and @entity12 traveled to @entity68 to meet ' citizen four ' , who introduced himself as @entity1			1
@entity12 filmed a lot of the meetings , which makes up a large chunk of her film			2
marketed as a ' real - life thriller , ' it is the first of several films in the works about @entity1 , who is wanted by the @entity65 on charges brought under the @entity130			2
speaking in the film , @entity1 says : ' i already know how this will end for me , and i accept the risk			2
' @entity12 , speaking after the screening , said : ' this was a film we had to make as privately and secretly as we could			2
' leaker : @entity1 has claimed political asylum in @entity69			0
he is wanted in the @entity65 ' we very much wanted to communicate in this film that [ it ] was about people who take risks and come forward at huge personal sacrifice			0
' @entity12 , an @entity65 , now lives in @entity179 , @entity73			0
she has been stopped and questioned when entering the @entity65 numerous times in the past 10 years			0
@entity1 's revelations sparked a global debate on the limits of privacy versus the needs of national security			0
his critics view him as a traitor who refuses to face trial in the @entity65 for his actions , while supports see him as a hero who spoke up for civil liberties .			0

@entity11 is a fly - on - the - wall documentary that gives a new insight on @entity1 and how he leaked thousands of government documents
in one scene he is told of a second whistleblower inside the @entity7 that is *sharing* secrets with journalists
the mole is of a higher rank than @entity1 was and has access to more information
film was made by @entity12
@entity12 and reporter @entity15 were the first two people @entity1 met with to share his story
she was working on a film about government *suirveilance* at the time
