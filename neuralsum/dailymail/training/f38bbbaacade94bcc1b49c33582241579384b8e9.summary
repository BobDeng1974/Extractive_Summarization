graphics graduate @entity3 , 26 , had swam out into the middle of the lake in @entity16 's @entity15 , before shouting out and disappearing under the water			1

mother - of - three @entity27 was with her children rowing in the lake when she noticed mr @entity3 in the middle of the water on april 6 this year			1
' as he was swimming his mouth was a bit over the water and a bit under the water , ' she told @entity34			2
' but he was talking about a race			2
' ' i do n’t know exactly what race			0
i thought two things - one , he wanted to race me , or in fact he was within a race and it was kind of a game and that is why he was actually swimming in the water			2
it was n’t clear for me exactly what he meant			0
' i said to my children he wants to have a race with us , but i carried on our way - he was still moving forwards at that stage , but then at that point he said ‘ i do n’t think i am going to make it			0
i am not going to make it			0
' ms @entity59 told the hearing she had initially thought mr @entity3 meant that he was not able to continue in whatever race he was talking about , but as she rowed away she saw him looking back towards the bank			1
she added : ' he had no sign of distress at that stage , but it did trigger in my mind because at some point i turned around and asked him if he was okay			0
' at that time he was n’t responding because he put his head under the water once , he fixed his hair , then went back a second time so did n’t answer me at all at that time			0
investigation : police cars attend the scene at the @entity6 following mr @entity3 's death ' but again i did n’t pick up any sign of distress at that stage - he was going under the water , coming back , fixing his hair			1
' but the third time after he put his head under the water , he never came back			0
' the court heard she then rowed back towards where she last saw mr @entity3 but could n’t find him			1
however she noticed ' bubbles ' appearing around her boat			0

ms @entity59 next desperately tried to raise the alarm , but said : ' straight away i was looking for the whistle on my life jacket - i could n’t find it			0
. so it went from one big frustration to another			0
' another onlooker , @entity96 , had jumped into the water in a rescue attempt , before the cold water became too much			0
rescue attempt : witnesses tried to help mr @entity3 , but were unable to save him as the water was too cold and murky in a statement , he explained that mr @entity3 had been ' acting strange ' when he first saw him			1
' he was doing press - ups and making noises towards the birds , ' mr @entity96 said			2
' he was not talking to them , but making noises			0
' after a quarter of an hour doing this routine mr @entity3 , who lived in west @entity16 , undressed and ran into the water , swimming for around seven minutes before disappearing , the court was told			1
mr @entity96 said that when mr @entity3 failed to resurface he dived in after him			1
he added : ' the water was very cold			0
i could not see him , but continued to look			0
' after a short time searching , the witness was so cold that he had to clamber into ms @entity59 ’s boat and abandon the search			0
another witness , @entity117 , was jogging along the lake and had initially taken pictures of mr @entity3 before realising the gravity of the situation			1
' i took my headphones out and then suddenly realised something bad had happened , and i freaked out , ' she said			0
strange behaviour : mr @entity3 was seen doing press - ups and making noises at birds on the banks of the lake in @entity15 before he undressed and jumped in saying that it ' felt like ages ' before emergency crews arrived , she added : ' there was a lot of fuss , but no one actually going in to try and get him			1
' however , the court heard that emergency services had cordoned off the area and were looking for mr @entity3 within about 10 minutes			1
