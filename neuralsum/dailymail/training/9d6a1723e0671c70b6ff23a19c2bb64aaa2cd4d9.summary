a landscape gardener is trumpeting the great @entity2 creation of the bandstand after touring the country 's parks to study the iconic structures for a new book			1
@entity8 , 49 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was inspired to research @entity2 's bandstands in 2011 after acting as a consultant for the restoration of the one in @entity14 , @entity15			1
he looked into the history of the bandstand and discovered what happened to the 1,200 that were built between the 1860s through to the @entity21			1
then : the bandstand in @entity14 , @entity15 , still exists today			2
it was built in 1871 and was re-erected in 2005 now : the bandstand in @entity14 , @entity15			2
the park itself was first opened in 1868 and remains open to this day mr @entity8 has now charted the demise and resurgence of hundreds of the outdoor theatres that have graced pleasure gardens and seafront proms in cities and towns from @entity34 to @entity35 for 150 years			1
many of the country 's bandstands were broken up during the @entity21 as the ironwork used for railings was melted down to make ammunition and weapons			1
mr @entity8 ' book , @entity44 of @entity2 , documents dozens of these structures that have been restored to their former glory over the last 20 years using money from the @entity49			1
then : the @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 was built in 1884 and still stands today			1
undated photograph now : the @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 pictured today			2
@entity8 was inspired to research bandstands after helping to restore one then : the bandstand in @entity57 , @entity58 , which was built in 1887			1
around 1,200 were built from the 1860s through to the @entity21 now : the bandstand in @entity57 , @entity58 , where it still stands today			1
it was lucky - many were broken up during the @entity21 as the iron used for railings was melted down to make ammunition and weapons it also pays homage to some of the 900 structures that have been lost to the nation over the years and those that have simply been left to ruin			1
his book is also a celebration of the elaborate architecture and ironwork that went into building beautiful bandstands in the 19th century , a creation that was copied in many countries across the world			1
mr @entity8 , a local council parks ' manager , said : ' @entity44 are a great @entity2 invention and have been a feature of our way of life for well over a century			1
' they were not just a focal point for a park but they provided a stage to perform live music , too			0
' during their heyday in the @entity96 era , bandstands were enormously popular and drew crowds of up to 10,000			2
then : the bandstand at @entity99 and @entity100 , @entity101 , was built in 1884 now : the colourful bandstand at @entity99 and @entity100 , @entity101 , pictured today ' sadly many fell into disuse and were neglected and many were demolished as public parks and seaside resorts went into a spiral of decline in the 1980s and 1990s			2
' in 1997 the @entity110 started investing in our public parks and gardens and this has seen the rediscovery of bandstands which has continued to this day			0
' and they are n't being used just for live music , but also for theatre , drama and opera			0
' then : a little girl poses by the bandstand at @entity124 , @entity125 , which was built in 1903 now : the bandstand at @entity124 , @entity125 , pictured today			2
it is currently kept boarded up while not in use although a pavilion in @entity130 in @entity131 was built in the 1700s to house bands to play classical music to large crowds , bandstands only started popping up after the industrial revolution in the 19th century			2
@entity8 said : ' towns grew rapidly and open spaces were built on			1
in the 1820s politicians noticed the working class spent much of their spare time in pubs			0
' they set about creating municipal parks for the industrial terrace - dwellers to relax in and listen to music and from there the bandstand evolved			0
' the first towns to build a bandstand included @entity149 , which once had 18 compared to just one today , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity131			0
seaside resorts like @entity52 , @entity154 and @entity155 followed the trend , with each trying to outdo the other with their ornate designs			0
then : the bandstand at @entity160 , @entity161 , was built in 1877 now : the bandstand at @entity160 , @entity161 , pictured today @entity8 said : ' a lot of bandstands disappeared during the @entity21 as the iron was needed to be melted down			1
' after the war the advent of the record player , television and cinema resulted in bandstands to fall into mass decline			2
' out of nearly 1,200 bandstands about 350 original ones are standing today			1
. another 150 or so have been built in modern times			0
