attendance : 13,591 ‘ that was the most intense match i ’ve ever played in , ’ he said afterwards			0
‘ we left it late but we got the job done			0
that was a proper game			0
it was so physical and credit to the @entity2 lads for making it as hard as it was			0
’ the last - gasp victory was delivered by 14 men after @entity13 was dismissed in brawl which also brought a yellow card for @entity62 from referee @entity79			1
@entity14 was one of three @entity2 players to be sin binned and their director of rugby @entity97 admitted his team ’s lack of discipline cost them			2
‘ the penalty count speaks for itself , ’ he said			0
‘ it was nearly double theirs			0
@entity107 ’s yellow card gave them the impetus and we could not get out of our own half			0
’ @entity111 , @entity0 ’s director of rugby , said : ‘ i think we deserved it			0
we were down at half - time but we kept moving their front five around and to turn it around was a massive testament to the character of the side			0
’ these two arch - rivals would have a fierce tussle even if the only thing at stake was local bragging rights			0
over the past five years these contests , dominated by @entity2 ’s success , have become hugely intense , heightened by the large number of @entity7 players involved			2
@entity128 - to - head : saints prop @entity131 and hooker @entity14 face off after a clash on the ground over the top : @entity131 delivers an overhand left onto @entity14 ' chin , that gets him sent off crunch : @entity14 is powerless as powerful @entity131 clocks him on the chin off : referee @entity79 is given no choice but to show @entity131 a red card , meaning he 'll miss the final @entity57 has spent most of the season watching the rise of @entity0 ’s @entity36 while the @entity2 centre recovered from a torn pectoral muscle			1
he had already rocked @entity36 backwards in the move which led to him finishing off a smart attack which put @entity2 in charge			0
@entity54 ’s half break , which was followed by him gaining valuable metres on the floor , cracked open the @entity0 line , allowing fly half @entity60 to work a big overlap on the right			0
@entity60 kicked the conversion to add to his seventh - minute kick which had put @entity2 in front			2
@entity38 equalised in the 21st minute as @entity0 enjoyed their best period of the half thanks to the inventiveness of scrum - half @entity162			2
his running power had helped earn the penalty by catching out the @entity2 defence as they trundled backwards			0
in the same period , a try by @entity45 was ruled out by the referee for a dummy jump before the ball was thrown in			0
walkover : @entity2 's @entity57 celebrates scoring the first try of the semi-final against @entity0 breakthrough : @entity7 centre @entity57 get the final touch on a slick backline move for the @entity2 try - saver : saints @entity162 is cut down short of the try line by an outstanding @entity54 tackle the disallowed try looked to be a crucial turning point as , apart from another kick by @entity38 following a sin bin offence for @entity73 in the 29th minute , the rest of the half went @entity2 ’s way			1
after @entity57 had nimbly finished off for the opening try , @entity2 ’s second came from blunt forward power			1
prop @entity190 stormed forward off a line - out and @entity2 camped on the @entity0 line			1
@entity62 , who needs no second invitation to use his pace and power , darted over			0
@entity60 added the conversion and @entity2 turned round 17 - 6 and looked in control			2
but @entity0 came out swinging and , despite the loss of @entity13 for his punching of @entity14 , the home team dominated the half			1
away fans : @entity2 ' travelling supporters show their approval of their team 's efforts early in the match all - in : a melee breaks out on the sideline in a predictably spirited affair between the old rivals a third penalty from @entity38 in the 46th minute rewarded early pressure in the half before the match exploded when @entity13 and @entity14 traded blows			1
@entity0 kept on the pressure and worked @entity37 over for a try in the 65th off a well - executed move			2
@entity38 converted to cut @entity2 ’s deficit to 16 - 17			2
@entity61 , who had replaced @entity60 , edged @entity2 further ahead at 20 - 16 thanks to a 65th - minute penalty			2
but @entity0 returned to the attack and the pressure eventually forced @entity2 ’s defence to crack when @entity6 finished on the left			1
@entity38 , who had contributed 11 points , missed the conversion but the one - point advantage was enough to seal a famous win			0
crunch : @entity234 ' fullback @entity31 is bought down by @entity2 ' rampaging centre @entity73 power play : @entity62 gives a fist pump after scoring while his @entity2 were a man down			1

@entity7 flanker @entity6 scored try in dying moments to give @entity234 lead
@entity0 now face the winner of @entity246 and @entity247 in the final
