allegations : sir @entity1 is alleged to have used his status to sexually abuse young boys with impunity at @entity5 in @entity6 police are set to launch a criminal investigation into an alleged cover - up of child abuse at a school linked to sir @entity1			1
the @entity13 politician , who died aged 82 in 2010 , is alleged to have used his status to sexually abuse scores of young boys with impunity at @entity5 in @entity6			1
but despite repeated complaints by his victims and previous police inquiries , he and others have never been prosecuted			2
a separate investigation is ongoing to identify suspects who actually took part in the alleged sexual abuse			1
now , @entity24 ( @entity24 ) are set to investigate whether their own officers and local politicians were part of a cover - up of what was going on at the time			1
the latest inquiry was sparked by @entity33 ’s @entity6 mp @entity32 , who claimed in a recently published book that @entity1 raped a number of young boys at the residential school			1
police , spies and politicians helped to hide the historical child abuse carried out by @entity1 , according to mr @entity32 ’s book , @entity41 : the double life of @entity1			1
this left the 29 - stone former @entity6 mp free to abuse children as young as eight despite 144 complaints by victims , mr @entity32 and co-author @entity49 said			1
today , assistant chief constable @entity50 , of @entity24 , said : ' following the publication of mp @entity53 ’s book " @entity52 " , @entity24 conducted an assessment of the allegations contained within that book			0
' as a result of the assessment , @entity24 decided that a criminal investigation was required			0
' the @entity24 investigation will now seek to identify whether any offences have been committed in the way that previous reports of abuse were handled or allegedly covered up			2
' the main concerns relate to the response to child abuse over several decades connected to @entity5 in @entity6			2
investigation : @entity24 ( @entity24 ) are set to investigate whether their own officers and local politicians were part of a cover - up of what was going on at @entity5 ( pictured ) at the time ' we have consulted with the @entity75 in relation to the national inquiry that has been announced into how organisations responded to child abuse , but as these matters relate to criminal allegations in the @entity24 area , the responsibility to investigate them falls to the chief constable			1
' mr @entity50 said that the allegations relating to the past involvement of police officers have been referred to the @entity89 ( @entity89 )			2
he added : ' in addition , we have established an independent oversight panel to demonstrate the independence and rigour of the investigation that we will be conducting			0
' if there are further allegations that relate to the conduct of police officers , these will similarly be referred to the @entity89 , as we are required to do			0
' claims : the inquiry was sparked by @entity33 mp @entity32 ( right ) , who claimed in his book , @entity41 : the @entity104 of @entity1 ( left ) , that @entity1 raped a number of young boys at the residential school fourteen suspects have been questioned as part of the inquiry into alleged sexual offences committed at @entity5 between 1969 and 1990			1
the claims relate to the alleged abuse of pupils by both adults at the residential school and among the boys themselves			1
earlier this month , it was revealed that prosecutors ruled there was a realistic chance of convicting @entity1 of child sex offences 12 years before he died			0
but they advised against bringing a case because the politician had been assured decades earlier that he would not face charges			0
escaped justice : earlier this month , it was revealed that prosecutors advised against bringing a case against @entity1 ( pictured ) , former @entity6 mp , because the politician had been assured he would not face charges documents made public also revealed that police knew of three potential witnesses to @entity1 ’s abuse but failed to interview them			1
@entity137 first investigated @entity1 in 1969 over complaints that he abused eight teenage boys at a hostel in @entity6			1
but the then @entity141 , sir @entity142 , rejected the case , ruling the following year that the allegations were ‘ somewhat stale ’ and ‘ completely without corroboration ’			0
in 1998 the @entity146 was asked to review the original file of evidence			0
@entity149 , crown prosecutor for @entity6 , noted in his ruling at the time that the alleged victims living in the hostel all complained of ‘ virtually the same type of indecent misconduct ’ and had given consistent accounts			2
he concluded : ‘ i have arrived at the firm view , having regard in particular to the number and nature of the complaints and how they came to be made , that there would be a realistic prospect of conviction			0
' but shockingly , the prosecutor went on to recommend against charging @entity1 because police had told him back in march 1970 that he would not face further action			2
today , mr @entity32 said : ' i welcome the fact that @entity24 are taking what ’s in our book seriously			0
it is clear to me that crimes have been committed , though i hope the police will prioritise the arrests of abusers who are still alive over whether council officers covered this up			0
' that is what the victims have told me is their priority			0
they want to see those who inflicted terrible abuse on innocent children brought to justice			0

sir @entity1 allegedly sexually abused young boys at @entity5
despite many complaints by victims , late politician was never prosecuted
separate inquiry to identify who took part in the alleged abuse is ongoing
now , police will investigate alleged cover - up of abuse at @entity6 school
they will look at whether own officers and local politicians were part of it
