doomed : @entity0 was high on drugs when he was chased by police in @entity3			1
he died after being held down and tasered 14 times			2
his chase and arrest were captured on @entity7 ( pictured ) @entity9 police who used taser guns repeatedly on a @entity13 student behaved with an ‘ ungoverned pack mentality ’ - like schoolboys from the novel @entity17 - a coroner said today			1
@entity0 , 21 , died after he was pinned down by police , handcuffed and hit with 14 taser shots after a late night chase through the streets of @entity3 earlier this year			1
in a series of scathing findings following the two week inquest in @entity3 , @entity24 coroner @entity23 recommended that five officers involved in the struggle be considered for disciplinary charges , but stopped short of calling for a criminal investigation into their actions			1
no definite cause of mr @entity0 ’s death was found during the inquest , but the coroner was told he might have choked while he was being restrained face - down on the footpath after he had had capsicum spray used on him and had been hit by tasers			1
the coroner said that one probationary constable , @entity42 , who had used his taser right up against mr @entity0 ’s shirtless body in what is known as ‘ drive - stun mode ’ five times , had shown ‘ appalling ’ judgement and had behaved in a thuggish manner			2
miss @entity23 said some officers had shown an ‘ ungoverned pack mentality ’ and acted ‘ recklessly and dangerously ’			1
some police , she said , ‘ threw themselves ’ into the confrontation ‘ like schoolboys in @entity17 ’ and recommended their actions be referred to the @entity56			2
@entity17 is the title of a classic novel by @entity60 author @entity59 which tells how a group of @entity63 boys form a tribe and try to govern themselves , with savage results , after they become trapped on an island following a plane crash			0
the shop 's owner did not think the incident worth reporting , but a woman outside raised the alarm @entity84 : the @entity13 student , who had taken lsd that night , is chased through the streets by officers in @entity3 ‘ @entity0 ’s only foes during his ordeal were the police , ’ said the coroner , who had heard that the student had taken the hallucinogen drug lsd earlier , had stolen two packets of biscuits from a shop and was in a psychotic state when the police chase began			1
‘ there was no victim other than @entity0 , no member of the public who suffered an iota from his delusionary fear , ' she said			2
‘ certainly he had taken an illicit drug , as has become all too common in today ’s society , but he was guilty of no serious offence , he was proferring no threat to anyone , there was no attempt by police [ to ] consider his mental state			0
’ the inquest heard that the manager of the shop from which the biscuits were taken considered the theft so harmless he did not call police – but a cleaner outside thought she had witnessed an armed robbery and raised the alarm			0
physical : officers wrestle with mr @entity0 in the @entity124 as they try to restrain him pinned down : the student is shown with a hand on his throat as the police pin him to the ground			1
it is believed he may have choked when he was rolled onto his front shock : he appears to have a taser gun held against his body as the police continue to try to restrain him miss @entity23 said that none of the taser stuns after mr @entity0 was brought to the ground were justified and that the police had been ‘ reckless , careless , dangerous and excessively forceful			1
’ aside from singling out probationary constable @entity42 for criticism , miss @entity23 also faulted the behaviour of the most senior officer at the scene of the struggle , inspector @entity146			0
his evidence , she said , had been ‘ so self - contradictory , self - serving and obscure ’ it was n’t worth repeating			0
' both his actions during the event and his attempts to exonerate himself and blame more junior officers afterwards are little more than contemptible , ’ said the coroner			0
@entity7 : student pinned to ground and tasered			0
@entity155 evidence : the area where mr @entity0 was held down is cordoned off as officers collect evidence criticised : the coroner criticised the police officers involved for behaving with a ' pack mentality ' and recommended that five be considered for disciplinary action handing down an open verdict on the cause of mr @entity0 ’s death , miss @entity23 recommended an ‘ immediate review ’ of standard operating procedures for tasers and capsicum spray			1
she also asked the police commissioner to consider whether probationary constables should be allowed to continue using tasers			0
after the findings were delivered , mr @entity0 ’s brother - in - law , @entity172 , said his family was still in shock			0
referring to the young man they knew as their ‘ beloved @entity178 ’ , mr @entity172 called for criminal charges to be laid against police directly involved in the struggle			2
‘ nothing will ever bring @entity178 back , but we continue to push for those responsible to face the consequences of their appalling behaviour on that night , ’ said mr @entity172 .			0
