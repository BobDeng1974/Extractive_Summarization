the clip shows @entity12 speaking to the camera before lining up the tiny ginger cat			1
he takes off his shoes before kicking the animal over his three porch steps and about 10ft into his garden			2
in the video the kitten appears to be unharmed and stands up immediately after landing on the grass			2

the youth initially responded to the reaction on @entity53 with the tweet : ' @entity56 now i got something to laugh at all day			0
' but as the outrage grew , @entity12 deleted the clip from video - sharing service @entity27 after it went viral and also made his @entity53 profile , @ @entity62 , private , reported the @entity63			1
by that time users of 4chan 's random imageboard / b / had begun a campaign to track down the youngster			2

users have in the past egged each other on to raid the @entity73 remembrance page of a dead teenager with abusive messages , targeted a @entity110 woman who launched her own campaign against internet trolls and , hilariously , gamed @entity113 's @entity115 poll to secure victory for young @entity118 dictator @entity117			0
however , as the @entity63 notes , users of the site 's / b / board did in 2011 help track down a @entity125 judge caught on video whipping his disabled daughter and , this past july , helped get an @entity129 man banned from his gym after he photographed people working out and posted the pictures to @entity73 to mock them			2
