@entity1 players should count themselves lucky they ’re not fighting on the frontline in @entity3 and @entity4 before whinging about the busy @entity6 schedule			1
that ’s the very direct message from @entity8 , who has told his fellow professionals to put up or shut up as those in the top flight face the most hectic month in the calendar			1
clubs are playing seven games between now and @entity15 – something to have drawn heavy criticism from @entity19 manager @entity18 ; the @entity20 is unhappy that he ca n’t spend time with his wife and children			2
@entity8 says the busy festive fixtures are a tradition that should n't be changed but for @entity8 , who has a young son , while not being able to enjoy the festivities with family is an obvious drawback , it pales into insignificance when compared with others			2
‘ you think about soldiers out in @entity4 or @entity3 and they are not with their families and they are getting bullets fired at them whereas we are playing in the @entity1 , ’ @entity8 said			1
‘ you have got to put it in perspective really			2
‘ it is hard if you have got family and kids and you have to leave them on christmas day to go and train but listen , we are a small minority of lucky players			0
the midfielder has broken @entity49 ’s @entity1 appearance record ‘ we have obviously worked hard for this , but we are lucky enough to have the ability to play in the @entity1			1
' you have to take the good with the bad and if you have to play over @entity6 you have to			0
we have a good life and playing football over @entity6 is not the worst thing in the world			0
’ @entity8 – who has broken @entity49 ’s @entity1 appearance record – tempered any suggestion that @entity59 ’s side are capable of maintaining their charge towards @entity62 qualification			1
@entity8 and his team - mates go into december in a @entity62 spot after a flying start to the season but they are flying and go into tuesday night ’s game at @entity69 on the back of beating in - form @entity71 at the weekend			1
‘ it is natural for expectations to go up			0
we are in a good position			0
if we can keep going the way we are going , who knows ? ’ he added			0
‘ to think , we are only ten points from the bottom			0
