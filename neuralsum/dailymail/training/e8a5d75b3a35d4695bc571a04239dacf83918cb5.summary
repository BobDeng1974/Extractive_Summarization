hours before flying to @entity2 to try to scuttle an emerging @entity4 nuclear deal with @entity5 , @entity1 prime minister @entity0 made a high - profile visit to @entity8 's sacred @entity7			1
wearing a black skullcap , he rested his hands on the @entity11 on saturday while praying briefly , before he made remarks expressing his respect for @entity4 president @entity14			2
this is amid tensions with the @entity17 caused by his acceptance of an invitation by @entity21 to speak on tuesday at @entity22 , as @entity0 stands firm on his bid to persuade @entity24 to fight @entity14 's @entity25 plans			1
this is amid tensions caused by his acceptance of an invitation by @entity21 to speak on tuesday at @entity22 ' i want to take this opportunity to say that i respect @entity4 president @entity14 , ' he said			1
' i believe in the strength of the relations between @entity1 and the @entity4			1
that strength will prevail over differences of opinion , those in the past and those yet to come			2
' @entity0 's visit to the @entity7 is his first to the sacred site before a @entity4 trip since he became prime minister for the second time in 2009 , according to the @entity48			1
it was followed by a visit to his father 's grave two days prior			0
the prime minister said his father , @entity53 , who passed away in 2012 and often gave him advice during crucial moments in his life , told him to ' always look at the threats endangering our people '			2
@entity0 reiterated that in his position as prime minister , it is his job to be concerned about @entity1 's security , and to also identify dangers in time and do whatever possible to try to stop them from occurring			1
@entity0 said : ' as prime minister of @entity1 it is my duty to care for the security of @entity1			1
' that is why we strongly oppose the agreement emerging between @entity25 and the world powers which could endanger our very existence			2
' the prime minister referred to previous leaders , @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity82 , who he said all took action when they believed it to be necessary , even though they went against strongly - stated @entity4 policies			1
his planned speech has caused 34 @entity88 ( 30 @entity89 and four @entity90 ) , including vice president @entity91 , to boycott his speech during the joint session of @entity24 next week , according to @entity94			1
the @entity1 prime minister said that he ' respects president @entity14 ' and that he ' believes in the strength of the relations between @entity1 and the @entity4 ' ( above president @entity14 ) but even a @entity21 is planning to miss the speech as @entity4 representative @entity100 released a statement on thursday and said she will also not be in attendance			1
@entity100 , the only @entity103 member of @entity104 ' congressional delegation , said she agrees with the criticism of @entity21 house speaker @entity107 's decision to invite @entity0 without consulting @entity14 , according to the @entity108			1
she also reportedly said she is more concerned about his speech scuttling negotiations with @entity25 to stop it from building a nuclear weapon			2
and earlier this week , national security adviser @entity113 came out saying the prime minister 's decision to give the speech ' was destructive to the fabric of the relationship ' between the @entity4 and @entity1			1
@entity0 is set to give his speech on tuesday at 11am , which will be followed by lunch with a bipartisan group of @entity24 leaders before he returns to @entity1			1
secretary of state @entity124 will leave at the weekend for @entity125 for another meeting with his @entity25 counterpart @entity127			2
the pace and intensity of the talks have increased as global powers gathered under the @entity134 , a group of six world leaders , have sought a deal with @entity25 to stop it acquiring a nuclear weapon - something @entity5 denies trying to do			0
a march 31 deadline for a political framework for the deal is looming , with negotiators saying they will aim to pin down the final technical details by june 30			0
@entity1 believes the sides are likely to reach an agreement that eases international sanctions on the @entity145 without applying sufficiently stringent safeguards to stop it developing nuclear weapons			0
during his @entity4 visit , the prime minister , who arrives on sunday accompanied with his wife and top advisers , will also give a speech at @entity155 's annual conference on monday			1
@entity0 's trip to @entity2 comes two weeks before @entity1 's march 17 general election in which he is seeking a third consecutive term in office			2
