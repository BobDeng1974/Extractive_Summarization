by @entity1 reporter published : 19:50 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 19:50 est , 21 september 2012 four men who pleaded guilty in the repeated sexual assault of an 11 - year - old @entity5 girl were each sentenced friday to 15 years in prison , terms they agreed to in deals with prosecutors			1
their sentencing hearings came after another man charged in the 2010 case chose to go to trial and was convicted and sentenced last month to 99 years in prison			1
legal experts said his harsh punishment prompted the four to plead guilty and will likely mean the seven defendants with cases still pending will seek their own plea deals			1
sentenced : @entity21 , 21 ( left ) and his cousin @entity20 , 20 ( right ) both pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child sentenced : @entity24 , 23 ( left ) and @entity25 , 20 ( right ) must register as a sex offender once they are released from prison sentenced on friday were : @entity20 , 20 ; his cousin , @entity21 , 21 ; @entity24 , 23 ; and @entity25 , 20			1
all had pleaded guilty earlier this month to aggravated sexual assault of a child , and each must register as a sex offender once released from prison			1
@entity21 also pleaded guilty to manslaughter in a 2008 case , while @entity24 pleaded guilty to another aggravated sexual assault charge in a 2009 case involving an attack on a different girl			1
each received 15 years for those charges and will serve those sentences at the same time as the ones for assaulting the 11 - year - old			2
each defendant was allowed to hug family members before being taken away by authorities			0
all except for @entity21 had been free on bail			0
relatives of the defendants declined to comment after the hearings			0
defense attorneys and prosecutors also declined to comment , citing a gag order in the case			0
during his sentencing hearing , @entity24 told the judge he was unhappy with his attorney , @entity59 , and his plea deal			2
' i feel like , well , my lawyer really did n't talk about the case , ' @entity24 said			0
the only defendant to opt for a trial , @entity66 , was convicted and sentenced last month to 99 years in prison afterward , @entity24 's father , @entity69 , and @entity59 argued outside the courtroom about the sentence			1
both men declined to comment to reporters			0
prosecutors say the girl , now 13 , was sexually assaulted on at least five occasions by 20 men and boys in the @entity5 town of @entity80 , about 45 miles northeast of @entity81			1
the girl was 11 years old during the assaults from mid-september through early december 2010			2
police began investigating that december after a classmate of the girl 's told a teacher he had seen cellphone video of men having sex with her			2
all six juveniles and six of the 14 adults charged , including those sentenced friday , pleaded guilty			1
the only defendant to opt for a trial , @entity66 , was convicted and sentenced last month to 99 years in prison , but he was n't in court to face his punishment			1
@entity66 , who had been free on bail , skipped out during a break on the first day of testimony , which included the girl 's tearful recounting of the assaults and @entity66 's role in them			1
crime scene : authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11 - year - old girl was sexually assaulted in november 2010 the trial , held in the nearby county seat of @entity113 , went on without him and a jury the next day convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of a child and then sentenced him in absentia			1
authorities tracked @entity66 down to an apartment in northeast @entity81 and arrested him on 11 september			1
six law enforcement agencies had coordinated the search for him			0
@entity66 was apparently caught by surprise , as he was sitting on a toilet when authorities entered the apartment and arrested him			2
prosecutors ' case against @entity66 included a videotaped confession and testimony from nearly a dozen witnesses , including the girl , who is now 13			1
the girl , who authorities have n't named , described the series of horrendous attacks that took place in the small @entity5 community of @entity80 , 45 miles from @entity81			1
in court , the middle school student , dressed in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and wearing a gold cross around her neck , described how @entity66 took her to a house in october 2010 where she had sex with multiple males			2
the girl said she was brought into what she described as the ' baby room ' in the house , and that @entity66 and others took turns having sex with her			1
testifying under the @entity154 , the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly			0
but she began to cry when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks			0
she said the video , which several jurors turned away from , was of her being assaulted by another man charged in the case			0
dirty : the attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home , pictured , police said she identified @entity66 in the film laughing in the background , telling the attacker to ' beat that ho			1
' ' did the guys just take turns with you ? ' prosecutor @entity173 asked			0
' yes sir , ' the girl said			0
the girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified			0
she mostly gave short answers to questions , often pausing to stare at the floor or ceiling of the @entity113 courtroom before responding			0
she described another alleged rape in november 2010 that started in a different @entity80 home the defendants called the ' boom boom ' room , according to prosecutors , and that continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer			1
asked by @entity173 if more than 20 males might have assaulted her that day , the girl responded , ' probably			2
' jurors were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers found inside and outside the house in the november incident			0
during opening statements , @entity173 told jurors he would present them with videotaped and written confessions in which @entity66 admitted to raping the girl			2
' what took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking , ' @entity173 said			0
@entity210 : @entity66 's trial went on without him and a jury convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of a child the prosecutor added that while the girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos , these individuals had ' duped , tricked and talked her into doing things against her best interests , ' according to the @entity222			1
those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records			0
the case brought unflattering attention to @entity80 , a town of 9,000 people , after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened , saying she wore makeup , looked older and was n't properly supervised by her parents			2
other community residents , as well as groups from outside of town , sharply criticized those suggestions			0
it has been complicated by a belief among many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated			0
all of the suspects are black , while the girl is @entity251			0
the four men sentenced friday accepted their plea deals after @entity66 was tried and convicted			1
legal experts said the seven adult defendants who still have cases pending are probably going to avoid trial after seeing what happened with @entity66			1
' unless one of the remaining co-defendants has something brand new , we are not going to see any more trials from this point forward , ' said @entity265 , a @entity81 criminal defense attorney not involved in the case			2
@entity267 , another @entity81 attorney not connected to the case , said a 99 - year prison sentence for one defendant would definitely scare his co-defendants into pleading guilty			1
but @entity267 said he believes at least one of the remaining defendants will probably decide to take his chances at trial			2
' trials are a roll of the dice			0
you have to weigh it all and decide how to handle it , ' the attorney said			0

all four pleaded guilty after agreeing deals with prosecutors
pleas likely prompted by sentencing of another of the accused , @entity66 , to 99 years
on first day of his trial , @entity66 *escaped* and *evaded* police for two weeks before being *captured* in @entity81
girl was gang - raped repeatedly two years *ago* in @entity80 , @entity5
other seven defendants also likely to offer plea *bargins*
