you just feel so helpless			0
the first thing i wanted to know was whether they had been on the house or just stolen the car			2
it was devastating to find that they had been in the house as well			0
' it had taken me a long time to find that car			2
there were only four on the market and it had taken me nine months to find the right one			0
i love motoring and cars are my passion			0
it was the special edition so it was a really special car			2
i only bought the car in october last year and the kids loved it			2
' @entity43 is terminally ill with @entity84 , and he in particular adored the car			1
in many ways i bought the car because of him			0
he could n't come on holiday with us in january so the two of us were going to do a grand tour of the @entity45 in the car			1
' it is only a car but it meant so much to him			0
it has been very upsetting			0
i drive a @entity98 estate as my everyday car and the tour in @entity101 would n't be the same in that car			0
' the court heard the theft occurred at 1pm on january 23 after opportunist @entity0 spotted the @entity6 and sneaked around the outside of mr @entity3 's cottage in @entity107 to establish it was empty			1
he smashed through patio doors and helped himself to @entity110 , a @entity111 and the keys to the car before driving away in it			1
@entity0 broke into mr @entity3 's home , stole electronic goods as well as his ' pride and joy ' @entity119 mr @entity3 was planning to take his terminally ill son on a driving holiday around @entity101 in the car the car , pictured , was written - off after @entity0 lost control at 100mph and crashed into an embankment shortly afterwards mr @entity3 who had a tracking device fitted inside the @entity6 , got a call from a vehicle tracking company who said his car was on the move			1
prosecuting , @entity132 said : ' the police having received information about the stolen car saw it on the @entity27 in @entity137			2
officers from the @entity139 notified other colleagues			0
' the defendant realised the police had seen him and while still on the motorway accelerated away and drove in and out of traffic			2
they activated the emergency equipment and a pursuit commenced			0
he tried to negotiate to the slip road at 100mph , left the road and hit the embankment causing the vehicle to stop			2
the airbags were deployed and the vehicle was damaged			0
@entity0 tried to flee on foot but soon gave himself up to officers and admitted he had stolen the vehicle earlier that day			1
the tracking device fitted to mr @entity3 's car later provided evidence that @entity0 had also sped through a residential 30mph zone in the country town of @entity163 at 82mph and he hit a top speed of 104mph before the crash			1
miss @entity132 added : ' the @entity6 was worth £ 60,000			0
i understand it is particularly rare			0
there were only four in the country and the impact upon mr @entity3 has been significant			1
he was on holiday with two children			0
the third child is disabled and was unable to go			0
father and son had planned a road trip around the @entity45 in the vehicle and were unable to do that and his son was very upset			1
' in a statement , mr @entity3 said his children are now reluctant to stay at his home as they do n't feel safe and he has been forced to increase security			1
defending @entity0 , who has 10 previous convictions for 20 offences , @entity184 said : ' he expresses that he fully embraces a custodial sentence because he acknowledges at the time of the offences he was not coping with life in the community and custody provides him with the stability he ca n't find in the community			1
the defendant is glad to be there			0
' he accepts that he was looking for something to steal that day and came across a house that was clearly unoccupied with an attractive vehicle on the driveway and he took the opportunity			0
' sentencing judge @entity202 said : ' there were only four in the country of this particular type of car			0
you were tempted by this vehicle and drove it away			0
you were seen by the police but decided to try and escape because you were , i suspect , looking for the excitement of driving at speed			2
' a £ 60,000 vehicle was written off which was devastating for mr @entity3 as it was his pride and joy and we also heard about how his children feel about the intrusion to his house			1
that 's the traumatic effect a house burglary has			2
it 's not always what is taken but the intrusion to a place people are entitled to feel safe			0
it is really by luck more than anything else neither you nor other people were killed			0
' @entity0 was jailed for two years at @entity50 , pictured , after admitting the theft after the case detective constable @entity233 said : ' it is a miracle that @entity0 did not kill either himself or someone else			1
he drove in such a reckless way and at such dangerous speeds that if he had crashed into another car , i have no doubt we could be talking today about a fatality			1
' he also showed no signs of slowing down or giving himself up until he crashed into an embankment , suffering only the indignity of some scratches from the brambles he tried to run through and the cuff marks when we arrested him			0
' i am pleased to see @entity0 behind bars , not least because he is a burglar who could still be out there today targeting people 's homes			1
i am sure the streets are much safer with this reckless and foolhardy individual behind bars			0
' but also for the family who have suffered tremendously from @entity0 's actions			1
he invaded the sanctity of their home , stole their property and wrecked a very expensive car			2
i know from speaking to them just how traumatic this has been for them , to the point where the three children have been so badly shaken up they refuse to now stay in their own home			0
' that is the type of crippling effect burglars like @entity0 can have so i am really pleased he has been convicted and is now firmly behind bars where he belongs			2
