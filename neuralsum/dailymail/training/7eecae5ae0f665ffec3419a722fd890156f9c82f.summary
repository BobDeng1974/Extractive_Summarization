the @entity8 leader tried to move on from the furore over mep @entity11 ’s ourburst by outlining his determination to remain independent			1
but his efforts were undermined when @entity14 established that mr @entity1 shares a @entity15 flat with mr @entity11			1
@entity8 leader @entity1 will continue to share a flat with mr @entity11 in @entity15 - even though he has suspended him from the party the two men have claimed more than £ 100,000 in expenses on the property since 2009			1
a spokesman for mr @entity1 said he would continue to share the flat with mr @entity11 – in which mr @entity1 ‘ agreed to take the smaller room ’ – even though he has suspended mr @entity11 from the party			1
asked whether mr @entity1 would kick mr @entity11 out of the flat , a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ no. @entity1 and @entity11 go back a very long way			1
’ he did not say whether either man cleaned behind the fridge			0
mr @entity1 said it was ‘ extremely unlikely ’ @entity8 would form an electoral pact with the @entity31			1
he said : ‘ we ’re our own party with our own agenda			0
’ @entity8 found itself at the centre of a political storm after mr @entity11 called a group of women ‘ sluts ’ and hitting a journalist over the head			1
mr @entity1 said his former flatmate had ‘ destroyed ’ @entity8 ’s annual conference – where he told activists they could hold the balance of power at @entity47 after the next election			1
a media scrum formed around mr @entity11 as the row erupted over his comments about women at a @entity8 event the @entity8 leadership are furious that mr @entity11 's antics have distracted from the launch of its drive to win next year 's @entity60 elections mr @entity11 , whose track record of outbursts includes comments about @entity64 giving foreign aid to ‘ @entity66 ’ , was hosting a conference fringe meeting to promote ‘ @entity68 ’			1
the event was attended by a number of prominent activists , including mr @entity1 ’s wife @entity72			2
when one female @entity8 activist joked that she did not have time to ‘ clean behind the fridge ’ – a reference to mr @entity11 ’s claim that women should spend more time cleaning – mr @entity11 turned to his wife and said : ‘ do n’t listen to this , dear			1
’ after a second woman then made the same joke , mr @entity11 declared loudly : ‘ the room is full of sluts ! ’ minutes later he launched into a rant outside , which ended with him hitting @entity87 reporter @entity86 over the head with a copy of the @entity8 conference programme			1
an unrepentant mr @entity11 , who later delivered his conference speech on defence policy , said he had made a ‘ purposely outrageous joke among friends which was taken as joke by women present ’			2
he said he had used the term in its old - fashioned sense of a slattern – a dirty or untidy woman – rather than its modern reference to promiscuity			0
it comes barely a month after mr @entity11 's complaint that @entity64 aid money was being sent to ‘ @entity66 ’			2
in the wake of the latest outburst , mr @entity1 told @entity108 : ' my opinion is @entity11 has gone beyond the pale			2
' he 's a friend of mine and i 'm sorry to say it but he has gone beyond the pale and i think we have no option but to remove the whip from him			0
personally i have had enough of it			0
' to add to the embarrassment an article emerged from 2006 in which mr @entity11 confessed to visiting brothels and said most prostitutes ' do it because they want to '			0
challenged by reporters outside the event , mr @entity11 defended the extraordinary remark : ‘ i made a joke and said “ oh well you 're all sluts ” and everybody laughed and all the women laughed			2
‘ was there a single women in there who did n't laugh at the joke ? , ' he told @entity108			0
he then called @entity108 reporter @entity135 a ‘ sad little man ’			0
as he made his way down the street in @entity47 , mr @entity11 was then accosted by @entity86 from @entity87 about the fact that a party brochure featured only white faces			2
he replied : ‘ what a racist comment			0
how dare you , that 's an appalling thing to say , you 're picking people out for the colour of their skin ? you disgust me			0
’ he then took the brochure and hit mr @entity86 over the head with it			0
he later wrote on @entity151 : ' it shd not b [ sic ] taken out of context & misrepresented by a hostile press			0
' made a purposely outrageous joke among friends which was taken as joke by women present			0
