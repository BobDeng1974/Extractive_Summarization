by @entity0 for 118 years , it has borne witness to crimes committed throughout the land			1
but now the trusty pocket notebook is facing the axe as @entity8 ’s biggest police force announces plans to roll out tablet devices to every bobby on the beat			1
@entity13 is pumping £ 200million into new technology which will allow officers to record crimes , check warrants and intelligence on suspects , and even order new uniforms at the touch of a button			1
the pilot scheme of giving 20,000 policemen @entity25 minis in replacement of their notebooks will be rolled out soon in @entity28 and @entity29 @entity30 @entity25 minis will be handed to 20,000 officers in a bid to slash paperwork and get police out from their desks and back onto the streets			1
a pilot is launching in @entity38 with a trial purchase of 600 devices for officers across @entity28 and @entity29 ahead of an anticipated force - wide roll - out from autumn this year			1
if successful , the tablets will be handed out to every frontline officer over the next three years , making expected annual savings of 30 per cent on the current it systems			2
the force will design its own apps , providing templates for recording crimes and taking witness statements , as well as giving officers access to local data such as the number of repeat victims in the area and directions to the nearest a&e department			2
officers will also have an app to take evidential pictures and send victims advice directly			2
@entity63 , the @entity64 ’s chief information officer said : ‘ we want the officers out there fighting crime on the streets rather than sitting in a police station tapping on a keyboard , not solving anything			1
‘ even if they are in @entity74 keying in details , then at least they are out there , visible and accessible and reassuring to the public			0
’ the new technology is expected to free up police time equivalent to bringing in an additional 900 officers and save £ 60million			1
the ipad mini is the smaller counterpart to the original @entity25 , and is intended to help officers record crimes , as well as check warrants and intelligence on suspects but critics have questioned the huge expense at a time of unprecedented cuts to frontline officers			1
@entity93 , chairman of the @entity94 said : ‘ i remember when i walked the beat with a notebook and whistle , we really have to move on from there and i hope this will be a progressive step			2
‘ but there will be times when the battery runs out or there is technical problems			0
‘ this is a lot of money when we have just gone through a massive swathe of cuts			0
‘ it is always preferable to maintain police officer numbers as opposed to new pieces of equipment			1
’ previous mobile devices have failed to deliver anticipated savings			0
in 2012 , the @entity117 found that a £ 80million @entity119 scheme to equip officers with 50,000 smartphones had produced savings of just £ 600,000 out of a projected £ 125million			1
in one force , officers spent nearly two hours more per shift behind their desks instead of out on the beat			2
last year the @entity128 warned that the @entity64 ’s own smartphone purchases could end up as ‘ expensive paperweights ’ unless they were properly tested , pointing out that constables were unlikely to take their gloves off to use a phone at 3am in the rain			0
but sir @entity135 is convinced it will reduce paperwork , duplication and lead to more criminals being convicted by presenting better evidence at court			2
he said : ‘ we are going to use technology to stop crime , arrest offenders or help victims			2
‘ we need to keep police officers out of police stations and reduce bureaucracy			1
digital policing will help us to do this			0
’ the @entity64 also wants the public to be able to report crimes using their smartphones and send a text to speak to a police officer			0
it hopes to shift 1million of the 5million telephone calls received each year to ‘ online channels ’			0
the force is already investing heavily in computer programming to forecast where offenders will strike next			0
the hope with the scheme is that it will get the police out from under their desks and back on the beat by streamlining paperwork and busywork that they have to contend with on a daily basis in a plot straight out of the @entity176 film @entity177 , where a ‘ pre crime ’ department detains murderers before they kill , police are using computer algorithms to map out where future burglaries are likely to take place			1
at the same time , 1,000 body - worn video cameras are being introduced across 11 boroughs and in the training unit of the @entity187			0
the cameras will mean that the actions of armed officers will be recorded and may be used as evidence			0
the move comes as police are trying to win back trust following the police shooting of @entity197 , whose death in august 2011 sparked riots across the country			0
deputy mayor for policing and crime , @entity203 , said : ‘ by taking tough decisions on the budget and the @entity64 estate , we are freeing up savings to reinvest in frontline policing and technology , so we can get more officers out on the beat and keep them mobile			1
‘ the public expect the police to have accurate information on - the - go , and cops deserve the best kit to help them cut crime and serve the public			2
the @entity221 strategy 2014 - 17 sets the direction for an unprecedented investment in technology - up to £ 200m over three years			1
’ ‘ this strategy heralds a once - in - a - generation opportunity to modernise the @entity64 and ensure it is fully equipped for the demands of 21st century policing			0
’ @entity229 member @entity228 , who is deputy chairman of the @entity64 and @entity230 , said : ' this is very expensive and it should be very carefully rolled out			0
‘ i know myself that technology can go wrong , but the concept is a good one			0
