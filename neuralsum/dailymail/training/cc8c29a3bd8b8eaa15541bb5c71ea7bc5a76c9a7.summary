tipping the scales at 32st and living on a diet of pizza and chips but too scared to sleep in case she stopped breathing , 28 - year - old @entity0 knew she had to do something about her weight			1
one year on , the @entity11 former pizza chef , who lives in @entity12 , looks nothing like her heavyweight former self and is now a slim size 14 , after embarking on a healthy diet and fitness regime			1
' before i lost the weight , i felt trapped in my own body , ' she says			1
' i could n't be myself as i could n't move or do anything i wanted to do			1
i feel like i can do absolutely anything i was n't to do and i can be as active as i want			1
' @entity31 's problems began five years ago , when a combination of lengthy shifts , a fondness for pizza and comfort eating resulted in slow but steady weight gain			1
her habit of tucking into piles of carb - laden @entity41 food at 5am at the end of her shifts did n't help and before long , @entity31 realised that she was tipping the scales at a mighty 32st			2
' the funny thing is , i would n't even say that i had an obsession with food or anything like that , ' she explains			2
' i simply ate the wrong things at the wrong time , for example at 5am in the morning when i got in from work before going to sleep , which is not healthy at all			2
' @entity31 , who says she was ' normal - sized ' as a child , was left unable to work out because her weight made it hard to breathe and even found doing daily chores difficult			2
' my weight affected everything in my life , ' she remembers			2
' i could n't do the housework ; i could n't even walk to the corner shop to buy a loaf of bread			2
' i even got turned down for a job because of my size – the manager telling me that they could n't have anyone working in their kitchen as big as me			2
' bad habits : @entity31 ( pictured far left ) says odd working hours contributed to her piling on the pounds change : @entity31 , who now weighs 13st , says she was unable to do chores at her largest ( left ) but can now ( right ) ' i was so depressed and exhausted that i got to the point where i could n't even leave the house , ' she says			1
' i think the most terrifying point of it all was struggling to breathe			2
' at 32st , i could n't sleep - so much so that my boyfriend would have to wake up in the middle of the night just to check that i was still alive			0
it was a really scary time for everyone			0
' finally , in a frenzy of fear for her health , @entity31 decided that the time had come to lose weight and enrolled on a slimming programme			0
svelte : now a slimline size 14 , @entity31 says the world is her oyster and hopes to get her dream job soon instead of tucking into heavy pizza and chips , she replaced normal eating with four specially formulated food packs per day and attended weekly counselling sessions			1
' her strict diet continued for a year and by the end , @entity24 had lost 18st			1
now eating normally - if more healthily - once more , @entity24 says that the combination of counselling and shedding the pounds has changed her life for the better			1
' @entity105 was the programme that was right for me a the right time and i think this is by and large because of the counselling , ' she explains			1
' you have be motivated to do @entity105 but sitting with a group of people and a counsellor who really understands you and the way you are feeling is invaluable			0
' having totally transformed her appearance and her health , @entity31 says her weight loss has also had a huge impact on the people around her			0
' i go jogging every day which i absolutely love - i ca n't believe that i struggled to even walk around my house before			0
i go bike riding and i absolutely love to dance			0
' i do n't think i could have done it without the support of my family , ' she continues			0
' my boyfriend was absolutely amazing			0
he loved me the way i was and was always supportive but my unhappiness made him unhappy and did n't allow us to lead the life we wanted to			0
' now when he looks at me i can see him just explode with happiness , he is so so proud of me			0
' my mother was always very worried for my health as was the rest of my family			0
i promised my father that the next time he would see me that i would be a completely different person and i did n't let him down			0
' when i saw him last year after i had lost the weight – he just started crying			1
i was still his daughter , but a million times happier and healthier			1
' @entity31 , who has since given up her role as a pizza chef , says that she is certain to find another now she is healthy once more			1
' i needed to leave my job and make a new start , ' she says			0
' i feel so powerful and confident that the world is my oyster i can do absolutely anything that i want to do and will find the job of my dreams			0

@entity0 , 28 , from @entity12 , shed an impressive 18st in a single year
she managed the feat by cutting carbs and *signing* up for counselling
