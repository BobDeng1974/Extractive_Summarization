a female lawn bowls player has been banned from competing for her local team , because the league claims women are ' not as good as men '			1
@entity5 , 51 , helped get @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 into the top lawn bowls division in the county last year			1
however , the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) has a strict male - only policy and its president has today pledged to ' fight vehemently ' to keep her and other women players out			1
banned champion : @entity6 are trying to overturn the ban on women players in the @entity11 after @entity5 , 51 , ( front ) was not allowed to play for her team ms @entity5 ' club are appealing to overturn the 21 - year - old rule after branding the league regulations old - fashioned and outdated			1
but @entity25 , 73 , president of the @entity11 , has said there is ' no way ' the league will allow a change in the rules and allow women to play			1
' the plain fact is we do n't think they are good enough , ' mr @entity25 said , adding that @entity6 made a similar - unsuccessful - appeal for change last year			1
@entity37 rules : the league 's president has said he will ' fight vehemently ' to keep female players like @entity5 out ' i would put my house and Â£ 1,000 on it not being passed again this year			1
' i will be fighting vehemently to make sure women are not allowed to join our league			1
' one of the middle leagues changed the rules and they started putting women 's names down on the team sheet before men , i could n't believe it			2
' i have been president for 13 years and i am standing down tomorrow , but there is no way we will let this rule change pass			0
' the simple reason is because men are generally better players than women			2
' ms @entity5 , who works for the @entity62 , led her side to the top of the @entity65 last year , allowing the team to play in the top county league			2
however , this achievement also meant that ms @entity5 had to be dropped from the team because of the men - only rule			2
when the issue was raised at the @entity11 annual meeting last year , many teams had not held their annual general meetings to discuss the matter , so it was voted down			2
yesterday @entity77 , captain of the @entity6 , said it was time the sport caught up with the times			0
he said : ' we put a letter in last year asking why women could n't be included in teams in the league			0
' obviously it was in our interest to have @entity5 as part of our team			0
' she was one of the best players we had and not just of the ladies - she 's better than a lot of the men			0
' @entity5 does n't play for us anymore , but it was n't just about her			1
' somebody has got to be the first one to put up their hands and say in this day and age should we still be doing this ? outdated views : president @entity25 , 73 , said there is ' no way ' the @entity11 will approve @entity106 's appeal for change as ' women are not as good as men '			1
' it 's probably the only league in the county which does n't allow women to play			0
@entity7 and @entity114 has been a mixed league for 15 to 20 years			0
' most sports that are n't intensely physical these days are coming round to the idea that women can be allowed to compete alongside men			0
' look at golf , where women are now allowed in the club house at @entity123			0
' there are ladies ' leagues , obviously , but just within localised areas as far as i know			0
' i know of several clubs that would n't have a problem with this , we have women that are good enough players just stood on the side watching			2
' i think these things need to be looked at in today 's world			0
