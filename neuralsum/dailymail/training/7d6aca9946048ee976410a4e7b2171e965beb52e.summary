the new technology helps those suffering from longsightedness by inserting a new lens into the eye a revolutionary new eye implant is set to make reading glasses a thing of the past for millions of people			1
the surgically inserted lens for longsightedness gives patients near - perfect vision just days after they have an operation lasting only minutes			1
known as the @entity16 , it restores sight to pin - sharp focus from just inches away all the way to the horizon			1
surgeons hailing the ‘ breakthrough ’ invention say that until now no insertable lens has been able to mimic natural vision so closely			1
the lenses are made of plastic and should , in theory , last a lifetime			0
currently surgeons can insert ‘ monofocal ’ lenses to treat cataracts , but they typically leave patients still needing reading glasses			1
there have also been multi-focal lens implants to correct vision both near and at a distance , but these often produce halo bursts and glare and give a ‘ stepped ’ effect rather than smooth focus			1
by contrast , the @entity44 design gives an almost perfectly continuous experience			0
the lenses can also be used to correct short sight and stigmatism – a condition which results from the eyeball being misshapen – and are best suited to older people			1
@entity53 , a 54 - year - old solicitor from @entity54 , is the first person in the country to be given such a lens			1
he used glasses for a decade before undergoing a procedure on his left eye			2
he said ‘ initially i needed glasses for reading , but i was soon in need of them for sports and driving too			2
i had to take several pairs if i was going out			0
’ he noticed the difference within 36 hours			0
‘ everything was a lot clearer , ’ he said , adding that he enjoyed being liberated from his many pairs of specs			0
however , at £ 3,900 per eye , the surgery is not cheap , and the @entity73 does not usually fund surgery to correct long - sightedness			1
mr @entity53 ’s ophthalmic surgeon was @entity77 of the @entity78 in @entity79			0
last night he said : ‘ i can see these lenses becoming the gold standard			0
you get a continuous change in focus – and there ’s no compromise on the quality of vision			2
’ long sight due to age is extremely common			0
after 40 , the eye ’s natural lens begins to stiffen			2
this makes it harder for muscles to tug it into the round shape needed to focus on nearby objects			0
our minimum focusing distance gradually creeps up from the ‘ normal ’ eight inches , until we have trouble reading			1
many people struggle on for years , straining their eyes in the process , before finally relenting and buying reading glasses			1
some opt for laser treatment , which helps by changing the shape of the eye , but as the lens continues to stiffen the effect lasts only a few years			2
@entity112 glasses could become a thing of the past with nine out of every ten people implanted with the new lens technology reporting they no longer have to wearing reading glasses at all , according to a recent trial but replacing lenses lasts a lifetime because the plastic does not alter			1
over the past decade various ‘ multi-focal ’ implantable lenses have come on to the market			0
they work like bifocal spectacles , with a ‘ step ’ in focus			0
they can also cause problems in distinguishing similar colours			0
however , mr @entity77 said : ‘ the way this new lens works is different			0
there are tiny circular grooves in the front of the lens which change the rays of light so that the range of focus is stretched out from near to far			2
‘ by contrast , multi-focals bend or split the light by refraction , which results in stepped focus			0
some of the light is also lost , reducing the quality of the image			0
‘ but with the @entity16 lens , virtually 100 per cent of the light gets through , so you can still distinguish between subtle colours			0
there ’s no step in focus , and , in terms of the quality of vision , they are the best yet			2
’ nine out every ten people implanted with them never have to wear reading glasses , according to a recent trial			1
although the operations are not funded by the @entity73 , mr @entity77 said people with private health cover may be able to get them more cheaply if they needed cataracts removing , as this already involves replacing the lens with a plastic one			1
he said some insurers would pay for the cataract operation , then allow customers to ‘ upgrade ’ for about £ 500 more for each continuous - focus lens			1
mr @entity77 said @entity16 lenses might become available on the @entity73 in the future , if the price dropped .			2

surgically inserted lens gives patients near - perfect vision just days after the operation , restoring sharp focus from inches away or into the distance
new invention could spell the end for reading glasses with nine out of every ten people implanted with them no longer needing to wear their glasses
however at £ 3,900 per eye , the surgery is not cheap and @entity73 does not usually fund surgery to correct long - sightedness
