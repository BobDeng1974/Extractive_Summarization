it went to the tune of @entity2 's cheesy @entity3 and proclaimed that @entity5 , in not too polite terms , was better than @entity6			1
now , with the @entity8 on his way home and the @entity12 primed for the latest chapter of a glittering career at @entity15 , it defies logic			1
but back in 2007 , when @entity19 fans belted out their latest terrace hit , they had reason to believe what they were singing was true			1
@entity8 midfielder @entity5 ( left ) gives former @entity25 midfielder @entity24 ( right ) the run around @entity19 striker @entity27 posts a farewell picture on @entity29 with the midfielder this was an exciting signing			1
along with @entity34 , sir @entity33 appeared to have secured the services of two of @entity38 's hottest properties and @entity5 announced his arrival in november of that year against @entity6 ' @entity40 at the @entity41			1
the @entity43 ' playmaker may have scored but in an electric 75 minutes on the field the new boy was everywhere			2
immediately the home crowd took a dislike			2
demanding yellow cards but playing with a smile on his face and a seemingly supreme confidence the new @entity55 international seemed set to become a long - time adversary			2
@entity34 and @entity5 leap for the ball during the games against @entity59 leaving @entity60 in the middle in february of the following year he was at it again in a thumping 4 - 0 victory which knocked @entity40 out of the @entity64 at @entity65 and he would go on to lift the @entity67 trophy , scoring a penalty against @entity15 after coming on in the 120th minute to help turn @entity70 red			1
so how did he go from @entity72 icon to a man famed more for his appetite off the field than on it ? from a Â£ 20m 19 - year - old tto a misshaped misfit he club could barely give away ? in that second clash with @entity40 , @entity5 again did not last the pace , this time withdrawn on 72 minutes			1
@entity34 celebrates with @entity82 during the opening day defeat to @entity84 at @entity65 in august the fitness issues were there from the start			2
at @entity88 he broke his leg in 2006			2
that luck followed him to these shores			0
at @entity19 he suffered a cruciate injury in 2010 and his knee went the following year			1
both meant long periods on the sideline			0
was motivation a factor ? it may well have been			0
when the second injury struck he was still only 22 but had already achieved so much			0
rumours that he had developed a taste for fast food abounded			0
in @entity110 , with its abundance of restaurants and @entity109 , he was not short of options			0
the joke even found its way inside the club			2
@entity115 was spotted telling @entity116 he brought him his burger at one o'clock			0
@entity118 and @entity5 arrive at @entity65 ahead of their @entity119 at @entity122 , they would ask where he was			1
' @entity124 's at @entity125 's ' was often the tongue - in - cheek remark			0
but it would be remiss and cruel to claim he got injured , got fat and that was that			0
even when available there is an argument that he was never allowed to fully express himself			0
perhaps sir @entity33 , whose brother and scout @entity134 famously described @entity5 as ' better than @entity82 ' was guilty of trying to make him into a player he was not			1
often he was cast in a holding role , a victim of his own versatility and a club well stocked with creative talent			2
when @entity33 went , the end appeared to be nigh			0
a loan spell at @entity144 failed to yeild a permanent move to @entity146			1
@entity147 went but under @entity148 he played only 90 minutes in that @entity150 thrashing at @entity151 and 20 in the 0 - 0 draw with @entity153			1
@entity5 played just one full 90 minutes for @entity154 and it came in the defeat to @entity151 in the cup both of those appearances were in august and things hit a new low when it emerged that despite @entity19 alerting others to his availability nobody came forward with an offer			1
eventually it was @entity166 , in his homeland , who offered an escape route			0
even in what would turn out to be @entity5 's final match in a red shirt , glimpses of that talent remained			2
picking up the ball in the @entity176 half during an under 21s match at @entity178 last month , he spotted @entity180 's run and dinked a lovely ball over the top of an unsuspecting defence			0
it was a brilliant and yet disappointing moment and left you feeling you were seeing a talent wasted			0
if nothing else , it was a somberly fitting end			0
on leaving @entity19 , the midfielder took to @entity29 to say goodbye			1
' thank you so much to @entity19 it is truly the best club in the world , i love it so much and have enjoyed every year i have spent there , ' he wrote			1
' thank you to all the team who work at @entity19 and especially all the boys , i have made some amazing friends , all of whom are great players and will continue to do great things			1
' and one massive thank you to all of the fans , for your continuos love			0
