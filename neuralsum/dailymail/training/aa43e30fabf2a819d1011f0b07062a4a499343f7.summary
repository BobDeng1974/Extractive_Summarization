by @entity0 follow @ @ mike_anstead ' would you like to fly the plane now ? ' asks the pilot with what i detect is a small chuckle			1
i 'm just trying to reacquaint myself with our old friend the horizon after coming out of a giant loop - the - loop , 3,000ft above the ground			2
i 'm sitting in the front of a tiny two - seater plane that is designed to do the kind of acrobatics that put your local circus act to shame			2
behind me at the controls is @entity19 , a @entity21 @entity20 pilot whose office is often the cockpit of a jet - fighter			1
he 's definitely the @entity25 in this partnership			1
so , yes , i think i 'll leave the flying bit to you , thanks @entity29			2
i 've been offered this unique opportunity during a trip to the @entity32 in @entity33 , a beautiful terracotta - topped town on the northern coast of @entity37			1
' you must eat a good , solid breakfast			2
@entity39 and eggs , ' advised @entity42 's @entity41 of the skies - the previous night			1
easy for you to say , mate			2
after nibbling my way through some fruit and toast , it 's time to head for the hangar			1
the @entity32 takes place over several different events throughout the year - the next one will be at @entity51 in august - and is a visual spectacle unlike any other			1
combining high speed and low altitude it is a wonder to behold from the ground , as some of the world 's most exceptional pilots guide their planes through an aerial racetrack featuring air - filled pylons in the fastest possible time , incurring as few penalties as possible			1
flying low : the race involves aircraft taking on a variety of tight twists and turns as they negotiate a course the world turns upside down : @entity0 keeps composed as the @entity32 jet performs a stomach - churning 360 degree loop above @entity37 the safety briefing i receive is pretty straightforward : keep your eyes on the horizon , tense your body when the @entity80 hits you and please do n't be sick in the cockpit ( there 's a bag on the side if the worst happens )			1
as we walk to the plane ( an @entity87 , for any of you reading this with a pilot ’s licence ) , i try to avoid looking at the bloke from @entity93 who flew before me and is now slumped on a sofa with a face that is roughly the same shade as a @entity97 apple			1
fitted in a flight suit with a parachute on my back , i pull on the helmet through which i can also hear @entity103 dish out advice			0
i suddenly feel rather small as the canopy is closed above our heads			0
' flight no 4 , please taxi to the runway for take off			0
' there 's no going back now			1
acrobatics : the planes perform the stunts at low altitudes so the crowds can watch from below we ’re off the ground in just a few seconds and soon rising sharply to the left above the emerald waters of the @entity120			0
in the distance - eyes fixed firmly on the horizon - i spot the uncompromising racecourse for the pros			0
i may have dodged that , but i 'm about to have a small taste of what they do			0
' enjoying the view ? ' asks @entity131			0
' ' ready for some moves ? ' ' erm , i think s.			0
. ' before i 've had time to add the ' o ' , we dive down sharply towards the trees below			0
it 's loop - the - loop time			1
what is the @entity32 ? it is a world championship that was launched in 2005			1
pilots race specially - designed planes through and around air - filled pylons on a course			0
whoever finishes in the quickest time wins , with points for all those in the top @entity148 can i watch it ? it 's a global event , with this season 's races being staged in @entity154 , @entity37 , @entity21 , @entity155 , @entity156 and two in the @entity158 ( @entity159 and @entity160 )			1
closer to home , the race comes to @entity51 in @entity163			0
@entity164 is on august 16 , with the race on the following @entity167 races in the championship ? there are 12 pilots in the world championship , including two brits - world champion @entity42 and @entity173			0
there is also a @entity176 series for up and coming pilots , with 29 - year - old @entity179 @entity178 tipped for big @entity180 it dangerous ? like @entity182 , there will always be dangers with super-quick racing , but the emphasis is very much on safety first			0
the world championship had a three - year hiatus as technical and safety rules were tightened , before returning this @entity190 do the pilots do when they are not racing ? all the pilots come from commercial or military backgrounds			0
bonhomme - champion in 2009 and 2010 - flies @entity196 747s for @entity197 in his day job.for more details and tickets to @entity51 on august 16 - 17 , go to www.ascot.co.uk/airrace thrilling : several competitions are held throughout the world over the course of the year ready for take - off : @entity0 gives a thumbs - up to the camera before taking to the skies for his acrobatics ' @entity208 ' warns @entity131			1
he then lifts the plane 's nose upwards so all we have in front of us is cloud			1
the @entity80 kicks in - i get the feel of four @entity80 ( the pros experience 10 when they loop in the races - ' it 's like being sat on by an elephant ' is @entity42 's verdict )			1
it 's an amazing sensation as gravity pins me back in my seat			1
keeping my eyes locked ahead , a few seconds later the water and then the trees come back into my now deranged view			2
it 's like someone 's turned the world inside out inside my head			2
after another @entity232 ( why not ? ) , @entity131 switches to a barrel - roll - tipping the plane to the right and turning it 360 degrees until it 's back level again			2
the manoeuvre turns the land below into a distorted ball of trees			0
it 's the first time my stomach rings the doorbell to ask what 's going on			2
he survived ! : @entity0 gives crew another thumbs - up as he lands safely back on land after his daredevil ride ' more barrel - rolls ? ' asks @entity131			0
' i think one 's enough fella ... ' he winds the plane down and down in a series of sharp left turns before blasting forward at 200mph just 25m off the ground through a set of air - filled pylons like those used on the real course			1
two days later , i watch on from my standpoint on the bay of @entity33 as @entity42 misses out on winning the final by 0.08s			0
i have a new - found respect for these daredevils in the sky			0
you can do the same at @entity51 next month			0
and with your feet firmly on the ground , you wo n't have to worry about keeping your eyes on the horizon .			0
