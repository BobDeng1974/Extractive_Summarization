by @entity1 reporter published : 15:30 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 02:03 est , 20 september 2012 @entity3 's nuclear chief has claimed the country 's nuclear programme has been hit by two attempts of sabotage as sources claim the attacks could be linked to the @entity11 military			1
@entity3 ’s vice president and the chief of its nuclear - energy agency @entity15 claimed power lines between the holy city of @entity18 and the underground @entity20 nuclear centrifuge facility and others leading to @entity3 ’s @entity23 facilities were blown up with explosives in august			1
he alleges that ' terrorists and saboteurs ' might have infiltrated the @entity27 in an effort to derail his nation 's atomic program			1
conspiracy : @entity3 's head of @entity35 @entity34 alleges that the @entity27 has been infiltrates by ' terrorists and saboteurs ' speaking at the @entity27 's 155 - nation general conference , @entity15 challenged the perpetrators to launch new attacks - stating his country is determined to learn how to protect its interests through such assaults			1
he then suggested that @entity27 might have been connected to the blasts , stating : ' terrorists and saboteurs might have intruded the agency and might be making decisions covertly			2
' @entity15 then added that @entity27 inspectors turned up to inspect an underground enrichment plant soon after its powerlines had been blown up , asking : ' does this visit have any connection to that detonation ? ' it comes as @entity57 sources have claimed there is a possibility that the @entity11 military may be connected to the attacks			2
a threat : footage from the @entity3 state tv channel @entity63 , purporting to show a successful test - fire launch of a short range missile the once - secret @entity23 nuclear complex in @entity23 , @entity3 , about 150 miles south of @entity67 a retired @entity11 intelligence officer who still works as a contractor with the @entity11 military told @entity70 that @entity71 have trained for sabotage missions inside @entity3 for years			2
he said : ' from the first reports , this attack looks like something from our guys			0
' @entity78 , the director of research for the @entity80 , told @entity81 : ' @entity57 operations against the @entity3 program is a good way to persuade the @entity85 that the @entity11 will back up its words with deeds			0
' the plant at @entity89 , about 40 miles south of @entity67 is buried deep in a mountainside to protect it from assault			0
ongoing testing : @entity3 's @entity95 test missiles in the desert it also is being used to enrich uranium closer to the level needed for a nuclear warhead than what is used to power most industrial reactors			1
@entity15 added the sabotage was foiled ' by using backup batteries and diesel generators ' that prevented any disruption to centrifuges used to spin uranium to enriched levels			0
he also said a separate attack on the country 's centrifuges - through tiny explosions meant to disable key parts of the machines - was discovered before the timed blasts could go off			0
@entity3 leader : @entity3 's president @entity117 @entity15 did not elaborate on the date or other details of that alleged assault attempt			1
dozens of unexplained explosions have hit the country 's gas pipelines and @entity3 's first nuclear power plant suffered major equipment failures delaying its operations for decades before going on line this year - delays that some experts attribute to acts of sabotage			1
but @entity15 insisted : ' we are a powerful country			0
we can confront any kind of industrial espionage whether it is an explosive or a virus			0
' we are eager and interested to ask the other side to have more ( attacks ) because having more we would be more experienced			0
' he then attacked @entity11 - claiming @entity11 pressure on @entity3 is the equivalent of an attack on all developing nations ' nuclear rights			2
he called @entity11 - led sanctions on @entity3 's oil exports and financial transactions ' the ugly face of colonization and modern slavery '			2
the speech caused hardline @entity85 leaders to call for military strikes on @entity3 - arguing that diplomatic efforts and economic penalties have had no effect			0
@entity3 has warned that any @entity85 attack would trigger a devastating response and @entity15 suggested that such strikes would not succeed in slowing down his country 's nuclear program			1
he said without elaboration that experts have ' devised certain ways through which nuclear facilities remain intact under missile attacks and raids '			0
but @entity15 insisted that his country 's nuclear program is aimed only at making reactor fuel and doing medical research			1
he said : ' the @entity3 ... has always opposed and will always denounce the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction			1

@entity3 's nuclear energy chief @entity15 claims power lines linking nuclear facilities have been targeted twice
alleges the @entity27 has been infiltrated with ' terrorists and saboteurs '
insists that @entity3 's nuclear programme aimed at making reactor fuel and for medical research - not weapons of mass destruction
