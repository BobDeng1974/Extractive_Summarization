by @entity0 published : 07:19 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 15:50 est , 6 december 2013 @entity2 and @entity3 online banking today stopped working for the second time in a week thanks to an apparent cyber-attack , in the latest blow to the state - owned financial giant			1
thousands were left unable to pay for their purchases on ' cyber monday ' four days ago after the group 's cashpoints and online services suddenly crashed			1
and today customers were again shut out of their accounts when the @entity16 and @entity2 websites seemed to become inaccessible			1
the company blamed the error on a so - called ' @entity19 ' , which occurs when hackers deliberately overwhelm a site by sending millions of requests for access all at the same time			1
some even suggested that the problems were once again affecting cash machines , claiming they were unable to withdraw money			2
@entity2 's website went down around 11.30am , leading to floods of online complaints , and stayed offline for an hour			1
the bank 's official @entity32 account advised customers to follow an alternative link - goo.gl / @entity44 - to access online banking , suggesting that the problem related to the website 's homepage			1
the @entity3 site was also reported to have crashed , although it was apparently working again after a few minutes			1
complaints : multiple users took to @entity32 to complain that the banks ' websites had crashed @entity55 told @entity56 : ' i was just trying to log on to move some money but the website is down			1
i called @entity2 customer care who did n't know about it - the gentleman i spoke to said he hoped it was n't down , because he banked with them and needed to get online himself ! ' he went off to check and came back to confirm , apologised and said they did n't know when it would be back on			2
' a spokesman for the banking group said : ' due to a surge in internet traffic deliberately directed at the @entity2 website , customers experienced difficulties accessing some of our customer websites today			1
' this deliberate surge of traffic is commonly known as a distributed denial of service ( @entity19 ) attack			2
we have taken the appropriate action to restore the affected web sites			0
' at no time was there any risk to customers			2
we apologise for the inconvenience caused			0
' the bank has given no indication as to who could have been behind the attack , nor why it was targeted			0
troubles : on monday , @entity3 's systems crashed , leading to chaos for customers who could not access money @entity99 wrote on @entity32 : ' @entity2 website down from three internet connections			1
mobile app not working , given up			0
' @entity3 customer @entity103 claimed that she was unable to use her bank card , tweeting : ' my bank card wo n't work and i ca n't withdraw a penny			2
' it is not known whether or not this was related to the web problems			0
on monday supermarket trolleys full of food were abandoned , mothers were unable to buy milk for babies and motorists could not purchase fuel as @entity3 's payment systems crashed completely			1
customers were unable to use their debit or credit cards , with some told they had gone into overdraft because payments could not be processed			2
the computer glitch lasted for around three hours , and affected cash machines , smartphone apps and websites belonging to @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity128			1
@entity3 chief executive @entity129 apologised for the technical problems which plagued ' cyber monday ' , said to be the biggest online shopping day of the year			1
he blamed it on years of underinvestment into the bank 's computer systems , and vowed to ' do better ' in the future			0
the problems have rekindled memories of the meltdown the bank suffered in the summer of 2012 , which delivered days of disruption for customers			0
a technical glitch millions saw unable to access their salaries in what was branded one of the biggest it failures at a @entity150 bank			0
the @entity150 government owns 81 per cent of @entity3 , and the string of issues affecting customers could harm its attempts to reduce its stake and return the bank to the private sector			2
if you 're fed up with your bank and thinking of switching , there are plenty of incentives to @entity164 is @entity167 's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are			0
top deals include @entity171 promising new customers £ 100 to switch and £ 5 per month if they stay in credit			0
@entity174 pays £ 100 to new customers who switch to its @entity175			0
on top of that , the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a further £ 100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 months			0
@entity185 's 123 current account , on the other hand , pays interest on in - credit balances - 1 per cent on balances between £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 , 2 per cent between £ 2,000 and £ 3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £ 3,000 and £ 20,000			0
