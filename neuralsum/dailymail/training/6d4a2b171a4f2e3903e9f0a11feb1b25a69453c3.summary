obsessing over climate change is distracting politicians from dealing with floods and storms , experts warned yesterday			1
trying to link all extreme weather to man - made global warming ‘ has been a social and policy disaster ’ , they said			1
instead , the focus should shift towards dealing with the impact of fierce weather , which will happen regardless of climate change , argued @entity12 and @entity13			2
a man canoeing along the flood water in @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 this february is pictured the academics from the @entity16 said flood defences must be given greater priority to avoid a repeat of the impact of this winter ’s storms			1
in a paper published last night , they said the government was too focused on cutting greenhouse gases , which was crucial but would never eliminate devastating floods or powerful tidal surges			1
senior politicians have been eager to link @entity43 ’s severe floods to global warming			1
the prime minister said man - made climate change was ‘ one of the most serious threats ’ the country faced and that he ‘ very much suspected ’ it caused the floods in @entity52 and along the @entity53			1
labour leader @entity54 has described global warming as ‘ an issue of national security ’ which would bring ‘ more flooding , more storms ’			1
and @entity60 executive @entity59 prompted fury when she said the floods had a ‘ silver lining ’ as they forced climate change on to the political agenda			2
but professor @entity66 , an expert in meteorology , and dr @entity13 , a climate historian , said that it was almost impossible to link any one weather event to global warming			1
@entity72 ( pictured left ) told @entity73 that man - made climate change is ‘ one of the most serious threats ’ the country faces , and that he ‘ very much suspects ’ it caused the recent flooding , while @entity54 ( right ) called global warming ‘ an issue of national security ’ that would bring ‘ more flooding , more storms ’ senior politicians have clamoured in recent months to link @entity43 ’s devastating floods to global warming			1
@entity72 told @entity73 that man - made climate change is ‘ one of the most serious threats ’ the country faces , and that he ‘ very much suspects ’ it caused the recent disaster			2
labour leader @entity54 called global warming ‘ an issue of national security ’ that would bring ‘ more flooding , more storms ’			1
@entity60 climate chief @entity59 sparked fury when she said the floods had a ‘ silver lining ’ because they forced the issue of climate change onto the political agenda			2
trying to do so was ‘ a distraction ’ , they wrote in the journal @entity101			0
linking ‘ climate change and high - impact weather events , although an interesting scientific question , has been a social and policy disaster ’ , they added			2
‘ the over-emphasis on “ was this associated with climate change ? ” distracts from the issue that weather happens whether or not climate change is occurring			2
‘ for most purposes , any change due to climate change is a less immediate concern than the impact of the weather itself			0
' society ought to do its best to protect the planet but society should also protect itself against weather disasters			0
’ politicians wrongly thought cutting greenhouse gas emissions should be the main response , the authors said			2
they said this was important but governments should also focus on measures such as building flood defences			1
but @entity131 , policy director at the @entity132 said talking about climate change was vital			0
‘ frankly it is dangerous to suggest that all we need to do is make ourselves resilient to weather extremes , ’ he added			0
it was important ‘ the public understands climate change is already occurring and the scale of the risk is huge ’ , he said			0
@entity143 and @entity144 , climate experts from the @entity16 , argue that flood defences must be given priority if the huge impact of this winter 's storms are not to be repeated			1
flood defences being built in @entity151 , @entity152 are pictured in 2009 after water inundated parts of the town dr @entity156 , of the @entity157 , agreed extreme weather was likely with or without climate change			1
‘ but i also think there is a strong case that such events may become more extreme due to climate change , ’ he added			0
the @entity165 paper comes a week before the latest report from the @entity60 on climate change			0
leaked drafts predict that the changing climate will cause severe flooding globally			0
chancellor @entity171 announced an extra £ 140million for flood schemes in his budget but this was dismissed as grossly insufficient by engineers			0
professor @entity66 said : ‘ reducing humanity ’s impact on our planet should be pursued as a matter of urgency , but more emphasis must also be placed on being resilient to individual weather events , as this year ’s storms in @entity43 have so devastatingly shown			1
‘ linking high - impact weather events with climate change can be distracting ; perpetuating the idea that reducing greenhouse gases would be enough to reduce increasingly vulnerable world populations , in our view , only confuses the public and policy - makers as to the socio - economic susceptibility to extreme weather			1
‘ with or without mitigation , there is no quick - fix , single - cause solution for the problem of human vulnerability to socio - environmental change , nor is there a reasonable prospect of attenuating high - impact weather			0
addressing such issues would give the world an opportunity to develop a two - pronged policy in climate security , reducing longer - term climate risks in conjunction with preventing shorter - term weather disasters			2
’ dr @entity213 said : ‘ avoiding construction in floodplains , implementing strong building codes , and in - creasing preparedness can make society more resilient to extreme weather events			0
but compounding the problem is that finding money for recovery is easier than spending on prevention , even if the costs of recovery are much higher			0
’ experts disagree about whether climate change - which is often symbolised by a polar bear on melting ice ( pictured ) - or immediate mitigation measures to stop devastating floods are more important @entity131 , policy director at the @entity132 disagreed , and said talking about climate change is vital			1
‘ frankly it is dangerous to suggest that all we need to do is make ourselves resilient to weather extremes without reducing greenhouse gas emissions , ’ he said			1
‘ a sea level rise of a couple of centimetres will make storm surges much more devastating			0
‘ the important thing is that the public understands that climate change is already occurring and the scale of the risk is huge			0
’ the @entity165 academics ’ paper comes a week before the @entity60 delivers its latest report on climate change			0
leaked drafts of the @entity60 @entity252 report predict that the changing climate will cause flooding around the world , displacing hundreds of millions of people and destroying vast tracts of cropland			0
dr @entity156 , senior fellow of the @entity157 , said : ‘ i agree that bad weather events are likely to occur with or without climate change but i also think there is strong case that such events may become more extreme in future due to climate change			2
‘ there is no real evidence that simply pointing out the links between possible future extreme weather events and climate change is the reason why investments in protection against such events have been reduced			0

climate experts from the @entity16 argue that flood defences must be given greater priority
they claim the government is too focused on reducing greenhouse gases , which will never eliminate devastating floods
