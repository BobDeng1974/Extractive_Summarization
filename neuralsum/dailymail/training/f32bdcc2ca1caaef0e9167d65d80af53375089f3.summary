by @entity0 a @entity2 lookalike who was bullied at school for being ' too tall and nerdy ' says she ca n't walk down the road without being pestered for autographs			1
@entity6 was constantly teased while at school in @entity8 for being taller than everyone else in her school and looking like a geek			1
the name calling and snide whispering was so vicious that the young @entity6 used to suffer panic attacks before going to class			2
@entity6 now works as a lookalike for the supermodel and is regularly stopped for autographs in the street @entity2 , pictured here working as a professional model , is often hired to attend events and treated like a star @entity6 , pictured age 16 , was constantly teased while at school in @entity8 for being taller than everyone else in her school and looking like a geek now the 37 - year - old stunner has conquered the bullies and has carved out a successful career in modelling and being the supermodel 's lookalike			1
striking @entity6 said : ' i was constantly bullied at school - i was always tall and used to tower above most of the older boys , let alone girls my age , and i worse these thick glasses			2
' this one girl - who thought she was a top dog - was always calling me names like ' freak ' and ' nerd ' and she used to lead everyone in whispering behind my back			0
' it does n't sound much , but when you 're younger and just want to fit in the constant whispering and teasing caused me to have panic attacks every day before school			0
' it was horrible and really knocked my confidence at the time but looking back it has made me a stronger person - all i think now is look at me now ! ' astonishingly when @entity6 arrived from @entity8 in 1997 - the height of the supermodel 's catwalk fame - she had no idea who @entity2 was			1
at school the name calling and snide whispering was so vicious that the young @entity6 used to suffer panic attacks before going to class @entity6 says that being compared to the supermodel and being able to work as her lookalike has hugely boosted her confidence the then 20 - year - old , originally from @entity68 , found herself in @entity69 , @entity70 - a far cry from the runways of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 - but was still stared at in the street			1
@entity6 , who now lives in @entity77 , joked : ' when all these people stared at me i thought there was something wrong with me ! ' i had no clue until one day , about a year after i 'd arrived , this woman came up to me and told me i looked like @entity2			1
' i just said " who ? ! " but when i looked it up i was flattered and started doing lookalike work			0
' i signed up with the @entity87 modelling agency in @entity88 , and i have been in work ever since			0
' she 's been a bit less of a diva recently though - i need her to throw some more phones so the calls start coming back in ! ' for the last 15 years she has been turning up at functions and events in stretch limos and being ' papped ' on the red carpet			0
she laughs when describing one event where she was surrounded by bodyguards , who took their role so seriously they even followed her into the toilet			0
@entity6 says that despite mixed reactions from people , she loves looking like the model and feels she has now beaten her school bullies as the supermodel - the first black model to appear on the cover of @entity111 in 1988 - has calmed down and shied away from the press , lookalike work has slowed for @entity6			2
however she is still stopped in the street wherever she goes - even if she is just out shopping with her partner and her daughter @entity115 , 13			0
@entity6 said : ' still there is n't a day goes by where i 'm not told i look like her - if i had a pound for every time that happened i 'd have as much money as her ! ' whenever we go on holiday i 'm always stopped for autographs - it probably does n't help that i 'm wearing sunglasses which makes me look more of a diva ! ' i had one woman stop me in the airport and ask for my autograph for her daughter as she was a big fan - even after i told her i was n't @entity2			1
' on the other hand , another woman shouted at me at the races the other day because she did n't believe i was n't @entity2 and said i was lying and being a bitch and a diva ! ' sometimes i just ca n't win , but i try not to complain - there are worse people to look like ! '			0
