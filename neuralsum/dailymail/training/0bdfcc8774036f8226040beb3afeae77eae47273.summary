' you personally saw them as they gave you money and you took it from them , ' he told him			0
' it could have supported children and their families through some of the toughest times they could experience , ' he told him			2
@entity41 @entity40 heard a new chief executive at the hospice became suspicious when she saw him hide something in his pockets and later count cash before work which was not normal procedure			1

more than £ 13,000 of donations were stolen from the @entity10 - based @entity9 ( pictured ) by @entity0 over a seven month period the prosecution claimed he stole £ 20,748 but the defence would only accept a figure of £ 13,500 and @entity0 was sentenced on the latter figure			1
the court heard he used a ' sleight of hand ' to pocket the charity cash			1
he kept some cheques back given by well - wishers instead of banking them and recording the amount on the donations account system			2

' speaking after the sentencing , @entity138 chief executive of @entity115 said : ' we 're absolutely sickened that a member of our staff who was in a position of trust has stolen funds from @entity61			0
' our supporters range from small children giving up their birthday presents to retired grandmothers skydiving for us ; all so that we can provide vital support and services to children who wo n’t live to adulthood and their families			0
' ' this is a shocking act of calculated betrayal and we hope justice means he will never get the opportunity to do this again			0
' @entity162 @entity161 who led the investigation said : ' @entity0 's actions are deplorable			2
to steal money from a charitable organisation especially one that provides essential care and support for terminally ill children and their families is despicable			0
