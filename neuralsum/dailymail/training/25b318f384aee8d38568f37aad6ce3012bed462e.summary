by @entity0 real ale enthusiasts are raising their glasses after a rare opportunity to craft beer barrels has come up for the first time this century			1
renowned brewer @entity6 's is taking on an apprentice cooper to help them make and and repair the traditional oak casks they use to store and transport their classic ales			1
classed as one of the rarest jobs in the real ale industry , the lucky individual will be the only apprentice brewery cooper in the country			2
only one person will be chosen to learn from @entity17 , pictured here working in his specialised field dying art : the role of cooper is considered one of the rarest jobs in the real ale industry , and the successful applicant will be taught by mr @entity17 , the country 's last remaining brewery - employed craft cooper the cooper profession dates back centuries and the tools used handed down through generations the chosen one will undergo a three to four year training period in order to produce , re-make and repair the family - owned brewery 's wooden casks			1
they will learn the craft from @entity17 - who joined @entity6 's as an apprentice himself in 1995 - and is the country 's last remaining brewery - employed craft cooper			1
mr @entity17 , 39 , makes hundreds of oak casks each year for licensees that insist on having their ales served that way			2
he also demonstrates his skills in the @entity50 brewery 's cooperage - which is one of the highlights of @entity54 's visitor centre tour - and at fairs , festivals and shows all over the country			1
the profession of cooper is said to require strength , intelligence and skill , with the finest barrels holding liquids the last time @entity54 's brewery advertised for a cooper position was 19 years ago in 1995 when mr @entity17 , who has now become the cooper teacher ready to pass on his knowledge , was the successful applicant as a finishing touch , the barrel is branded with writing identifying it as created at @entity6 's in @entity74 @entity75 mr @entity17 , pictured with the finished products - 66 traditional small casks that each hold 36 pints brewery director , @entity54 said : ' we are very proud to be one of the last breweries in the country to supply our ale in wooden casks and also to be preserving an ancient and skilled art. ' tradition is respected not only in the brewing industry but in thousands of pubs throughout the country			1
we know consumers strongly approve of the idea of beer served from wood and we plan to continue that tradition			0
traditionally , a cooper is someone who makes wooden , staved containers with flat ends that are bound together with metal hoops			0
historically , this included casks , barrels , buckets and tubs , with the containers used for holding a range of items including milk , gunpowder , flour and tobacco			0
the profession dates back to @entity113 and was considered one of the most important medieval trades , evidenced by the appropriation of the word ' cooper ' as a surname into a number of different languages			0
however , the prevalence of modern metal and plastic casks , as well as timber shortages , has seen the number of coopers in @entity128 drastically reduce in the past 50 or 60 years			0
it is thought there are no master coopers left in @entity128 - a rank attained only when one has successfully trained an apprentice			0
' we have been using wooden casks since the company was founded by my great , great grandfather 187 years ago			1
' the last time we advertised for this position was in 1995 , and @entity17 was the successful applicant			0
' watching @entity17 at work is fascinating and he uses the same methods and tools to create casks that coopers have used for hundreds and hundreds of years			2
' the growing popularity of our cask ales means that @entity17 now requires another pair of hands to help him in his important job			0
however , coopering is a skill that can not be learned overnight , and the training period can take up to four years			2
' it is hard work , but the lucky applicant will know they are in a unique position - that of being the country 's only brewery - employed apprentice craft cooper			1
