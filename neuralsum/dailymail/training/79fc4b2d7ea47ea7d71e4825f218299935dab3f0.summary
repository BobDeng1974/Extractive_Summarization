by @entity0 published : 07:05 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 12:34 est , 11 march 2013 the lavatory at a rural museum has become a tourist attraction in its own right because of the way it leans at an extraordinary angle			1
tourist have been flocking to the @entity9 and @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , to take pictures of themselves using the listing loo			1
dubbed the ' @entity16 ' , the small redbrick privy leans at an angle just like its @entity19 counterpart , and often attract queues as visitors take hilarious pictures of each other at the listed building			1
the station attendant 's loo leans against the museum as demonstrated by museum helper @entity28 , 58 talk about a listed building : mr @entity28 demonstrates the angle of the wonky redbrick lavatory unlike the famed @entity19 tower , however , visitors are - in both senses - allowed to go inside			1
giving new meaning to the phrase ' listed building ' , the outdoor toilet at @entity37 was built around 1940 for the use of the pumping station attendant			1
due to soft ground and poor foundations , it began to develop a lean soon after completion , and now reclines against the neighbouring museum building			2
the angular outhouse was spotted by keen - eyed @entity50 , who said : ' it made me smile			0
' the toilet block is leaning on the wall of a larger building - in much the same way a drunk would lean on a toilet wall			2
' @entity59 , membership secretary for the @entity60 , said : ' nobody knows how long exactly it has been leaning for			0
leaning @entity63 - sa : the loo 's foundations probably shifted soon after it was built in around 1920 ' the toilet was built in the 1940s , before then there was just a wooden plank over the river			1
' it was built on a level but over the years it has sunk on one side and leans against a building now so it ca n't move any more			1
' the toilet is certainly a talking point for visitors , and it is very popular for people who take photos of it			2
' it certainly brings a new meaning to the term ' listed building ' and it is still functional but we are building a new block of toilets and it will just be an exhibit			2
' the museum , near @entity92 , in @entity12 , is home to the county 's oldest steam - powered pumping station , which was once used to drain the @entity96			1
the main attraction is the 1861 steam engine and pump - the only one in the country still in its original position and in working order			0
the museum also has a number of steam engines and pumps , as well as a short length of narrow - gauge railway			0
the mechanical pumping station was built in 1830 to drain the waterlogged ' levels ' around @entity11 , @entity110 , and @entity111			0
its drainage system proved such a success that further pumping stations were built in the area to do the same job			0
a cottage was built next door to the pumping station , to provide accommodation for the pumping attendant , and later on the outdoor lavatory			0
the pump operated until 1951 , by which time it had become redundant because of other , more modern , drainage methods			0
now the pump house is @entity128 - listed .			0
