@entity0 has hit out at @entity2 ’s treatment of @entity3 , blaming them for the @entity7 striker ’s thigh injury			1
@entity3 was injured last friday in a training session he had asked to sit out , less than 48 hours after playing 89 minutes of @entity2 ’s 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity10			1
that meant he missed monday ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity13 in a @entity15 qualifier and is now out for a further three weeks			2
@entity0 is furious his star striker was not given more rest			1
watch scroll down for @entity0 : @entity3 did n't get proper recovery with @entity2 @entity3 is out for three weeks after getting injured during training on @entity2 duty @entity3 's thigh strain in camp with the national team could have been avoided , says @entity0 @entity3 shows his skills in training for @entity2 against @entity26 just before going down injured ‘ we ’re disappointed because we feel it ’s an injury which could have been prevented , ’ the @entity28 boss told @entity29			1
‘ clubs work differently to international teams			0
it ’s the recovery strategy			0
when we look at our players here , we look at them individually , in terms of what their needs are			0
’ had @entity3 been involved in a @entity7 game rather than an @entity2 match last wednesday , he would have only been required to do light running and stretching on what is regarded as the ‘ second recovery day ’			1
however , with @entity2 facing a crucial trip to @entity13 , it is believed boss @entity47 wanted to maximise his time with the players and involved @entity3 in the session despite the 25 - year - old expressing concerns			1
@entity3 played in the friendly against @entity10 at @entity53 , which @entity2 won 1 - 0 @entity3 could be out for up to two weeks but should return for the @entity55 derby ‘ some players are very fast , they will have a second day , active recovery , whereas other players can work on that second day , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ when you ’re a type of player like @entity61 or @entity3 , you need to recover them differently			2
‘ from what i ’ve seen , @entity3 sprinted with the ball for nearly 50 yards to shoot and that ’s when he pulls up			2
that ’s where the issues are			0
’ @entity7 could be without @entity3 for fixtures including the @entity55 derby on september 27 and the @entity73 game in @entity74 on october 1			1
@entity0 added : ‘ the players go ( away on international duty ) and tell the associations how they work			1
of course , it ’s always up to the manager			0
‘ and on that second day for us , the sessions are only low to moderate intensity in small spaces , or you get injuries			0
if you ask most players , the second day is when they really feel it , although some are different			0
@entity47 has probably been led by ( @entity2 ’s ) sports science department			2
‘ but you ca n’t throw a blanket over all the players			0
one recovery programme does n’t fit them all			0
@entity92 needed to do extra work on his second day of recovery			0
it is about maximising availability			0
’ the international break has severely hit @entity7 , with @entity98 suffering an ankle twist during @entity102 ’s @entity101 win over @entity103 that will keep him out for up to six weeks , while @entity104 jarred a knee during @entity107 ’s 2 - 1 win over @entity108			2
the @entity109 must compensate @entity7 up to £ 200,000 — three weeks ’ of @entity3 ’s wages			1
they are aware of @entity7 ’s concerns and have discussed the matter with the club .			2
