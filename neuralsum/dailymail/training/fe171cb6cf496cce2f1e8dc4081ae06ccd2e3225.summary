@entity1 politics faces being plunged into chaos after the election , as a detailed study of seats across the country shows at least three parties would be needed to form a coalition			1
political commentator @entity9 predicts @entity10 will win 300 seats and the @entity12 279 , but both would need at least two other parties to secure a majority of the 650 mps in the @entity17			1
today @entity18 ruled out ever sitting in a @entity19 with @entity20 while @entity22 leader @entity21 said her party would not join a power - sharing deal with anyone			1
instead he has spent recent weeks looking at every seat in the country , and using polling , local knowledge and ' sniffing the political wind ' to predict what will happen in each constituency			0
writing in the @entity46 on sunday , mr @entity9 said : ' the truth is that this is the most unpredictable election in recent memory and for one very simple reason – for the first time in @entity1 political history , we 're now in five party politics			2
' for the first time ever it 's conceivable that the joint vote share of the two main parties might be under 60 per cent			0
' he predicts that the @entity12 will ' pile up votes in seats where they do n't need them ' , suggesting @entity10 could get more seats but fewer votes			0
the study confidently predicts that the @entity65 ' will lose more than half of their seats ' , taking them to just 24			1
' it could get even worse , although i reckon @entity18 will be safe in @entity70 , ' he adds			0
it means that even with the support of the @entity65 , neither @entity10 nor the @entity12 would be able to form an overall majority			1
a so - called ' @entity74 ' would then need to be agreed involving three or more parties , which all leaders acknowledge will be incredibly unstable			0
mr @entity18 today flatly ruled out at the idea of serving in a government with @entity79 which also included @entity20 mps			1
asked if he could imagine a power - sharing deal with @entity20 , he told @entity85 's @entity84 show : ' no. i just really can not see how @entity79 and i could ever … ' it has been suggested that @entity10 could be forced to rely on @entity88 support to form a government			1
but mr @entity18 also cast doubt on the @entity65 entering power with the @entity93 nationalists			1
' i find it very difficult to imagine the circumstances in which i would do that , ' he added			0
mr @entity18 also ridiculed mr @entity9 's prediction that the @entity65 would lose half of their seats			1
' @entity9 will have to eat his words , because i really do n't think that 's going to happen			0
he 's a good man but some of his predictions are getting a bit silly , ' he said			0
the @entity22 last week overtook both the @entity65 and @entity20 in terms of party membership , and have demanded a place in tv leaders ' debates			2
ms @entity21 insisted the @entity110 would have a big impact at the election , despite the forecast that the party would not gain any more mps			0
but she insisted that the @entity110 did not intend to be part of a formal coalition with any other parties she told @entity85 : ' we have very clearly said we 're not looking towards a coalition , we 're looking towards confidence and supply			0
' so what that would mean , we would be able to vote vote - by - vote so we could vote against @entity125 and we would vote against @entity125			0
' @entity65 leader @entity18 today ruled out entering coalition with @entity20 while the @entity22 's @entity21 ruled out a power - sharing deal with anyone a new poll suggests @entity10 is on course to lose half its 40 @entity93 seats at @entity132 in may			1
the @entity88 could increase its seats from six to 35 , according to an analysis of poll figures by @entity136			2
the @entity138 poll of 1,007 @entity93 adults asked which way they would be likely to vote if there was a @entity1 parliamentary election tomorrow			0
the results , excluding do n't knows , put the @entity88 on 41 per cent and @entity10 on 31 per cent , with the conservatives on 14 per cent , @entity20 on 7 per cent and the @entity65 on 3 per cent			1
however , mr @entity9 casts doubts on the idea of an @entity88 landslide of up to 40 seats , claiming they will get just 18 at best			2
while @entity20 and the @entity110 will take votes from the @entity12 and @entity10 , costing them marginal seats in many areas , they will not make huge gains , he says			2
mr @entity9 predicts @entity20 winning only five seats and the @entity110 remaining on just one , the same number they got in 2010 .			2

political commentator @entity9 *publishing* prediction for every seat
study suggest *labour* will get 300 seats and the @entity144 279

@entity65 @entity18 rules out ever entering a coalition which included @entity20
dismisses claim that @entity65 will lose half of their seats as ' silly '
