by @entity0 an @entity2 couple have made a desperate plea for help after they became stranded in @entity6 with their newborn twins , born via a @entity6 surrogate mother			1
@entity10 and @entity11 , from @entity12 , on the mid north coast of @entity14 , are one of the many @entity2 couples who have become locked in legal battles after changes to @entity6 's commercial surrogacy laws			1
they reportedly turned to @entity6 surrogacy as a last resort after numerous failed @entity22 attempts in @entity23			2
' they are in a tiny motel room with two newborns and money is running out fast , ' their friend @entity24 wrote on a fundraising page set up to help the family			0
anyone who disobeys this law could potentially be charged with child trafficking			0
mr and mrs @entity53 's twin daughters , @entity34 and @entity35 , were born in @entity6 on july 22 , just weeks before the horrific story of baby @entity55 emerged and shocked the world			1
@entity55 , also a twin , was born to a @entity6 surrogate mother , @entity57 , but was allegedly abandoned by his @entity2 parents because he had down syndrome			1
@entity55 's biological father @entity60 later revealed in a @entity62 interview he would have terminated the embryo had he discovered the child 's @entity59 sooner , saying : ' no parent wants a son with a disability '			1
mr @entity11 explained that they can not simply bring their children home to @entity23 now , despite having all the required @entity2 documentation			2
the couple from @entity14 turned to a @entity6 surrogate after failed @entity22 attempts in @entity23			1
they are currently stranded in a @entity6 motel with their newborn girls ' our twin girls have all their relevant paperwork ( @entity2 citizenship , @entity2 passports ) , ' he said while decribing his ' @entity6 horror story '			2
' before the @entity6 army cracked down on commercial surrogacy on the twins birthday ( 22/7/2014 ) you could just leave the country without anyone batting an eyelid with your new family			1
' now its a different story , now its considered " human trafficking " because they see it as though we are stealing someones children , and if they ask to see babies ' birth certificate that is proof because our surrogate 's name is on certificate as their mother			1
' we had @entity102 tests done and our babies are our babies and in no way , shape or form are related to birth mother ( our surrogate )			2
so we have to go through the courts now and get a court order to leave the country , ' he explained			1
the young couple had already tried many unsuccessful rounds of @entity22 treatment in @entity23 before they went overseas to use a surrogate mother			1
at the end of july the laws radically changed to mean parents of surrogate children born in the country can no longer leave @entity6 with their children without a court order the @entity12 couple have posted photos of their baby girls from the @entity6 motel room they are staying in as they try and raise funds @entity10 's sister @entity130 told the @entity131 ' this was their last chance ' at having children			1
' believe me , they have tried everything and this was not an easy option to take			0
' we just want them home with their girls to be with their family			0
' their families have only seen a picture of the little girls and all we want to do is hold them in our arms			0
' the couple reportedly missed their planned flight home this week as the @entity6 authorities blocked them from leaving with their girls			2
meanwhile , a same - sex couple who are also caught up in the crackdown on surrogacy in @entity6 have told the @entity158 they know at least 20 @entity2 couples who are now stuck in @entity161 hotels			1
' this is very emotionally draining			0
we had a meeting and i told them not to be stressed , to enjoy the fact they have their babies , ' @entity163 said			0
the 46 - year - old from @entity172 said he and his partner @entity173 are waiting to see if they can bring their baby boy @entity175 home			0
he explained that the @entity2 couples he had spoken to thought they would be in @entity6 for five or six weeks and ' now there are rumours they will have to stay three months or six months , or who knows how long '			0
he said many are experiencing financial difficulties			0
a recent statement from the @entity2 @entity185 , regarding @entity2 parents being prevented from bringing their children home from @entity6 , said : ' we have been advised that @entity6 authorities may enforce enhanced documentation requirements when exiting the country , when they suspect a child has been born by surrogacy in @entity6			1
mr @entity11 explained that they can not simply bring their children home to @entity23 now , despite having all the required @entity2 documentation ' the @entity198 's @entity197 website was updated on 14 august to reflect these requirements			2
' we strongly urge @entity23 entering @entity6 for the purposes of commercial surrogacy to seek independent legal advice in both @entity6 and @entity23 before doing so			1
in particular , they should seek advice on the implications of any new exit requirements			0
' while regulation of surrogacy in @entity6 is a matter for @entity6 , we continue to encourage @entity6 authorities to adopt appropriate transitional arrangements for any new measures they may introduce , so concerned @entity23 are not unduly affected			2
' mr and mrs @entity53 are hoping to raise money to pay for new flights home and for the cost of their unexpectedly long stay in @entity6			0
@entity218 has contacted the couple for comment			0
