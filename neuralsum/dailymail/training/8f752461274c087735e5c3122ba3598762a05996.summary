a glass of red wine or a handful of peanuts could help prevent memory loss because they both contain a crucial antioxidant , new research has revealed			1
experts believe a compound found in common foods such as red grapes could even prove vital in the battle against alzheimer 's disease			1
both peanuts and red grapes as well as red wine and some berries contain an antioxidant that is capable of protecting cells from age - related damage , researchers say			1
a glass of red wine or a handful of peanuts could help prevent memory loss because they both contain a crucial antioxidant , new research has revealed ( file picture ) resveratrol has been widely touted for its potential to prevent heart disease , but a team of @entity32 scientists believe it also has positive effects on the hippocampus , an area of the brain that is critical to functions such as memory , learning and mood			1
the latest research was led by @entity42 , a professor in the @entity43 and director of neurosciences at the @entity45 in @entity46			2
because both humans and animals show a decline in cognitive capacity after middle age , the findings may have implications for treating memory loss in the elderly			0
resveratrol may even be able to help people afflicted with severe neurodegenerative conditions such as alzheimer 's disease			0
in a study published online in @entity61 , @entity42 and his research team members reported that treatment with resveratrol had apparent benefits in terms of learning , memory and mood function in aged rats			2
both peanuts and red grapes as well as red wine and some berries contain an antioxidant that is capable of protecting cells from age - related damage , researchers say ' the results of the study were striking , ' professor @entity42 said			1
' they indicated that for the control rats who did not receive resveratrol , spatial learning ability was largely maintained but ability to make new spatial memories significantly declined between 22 and 25 months			0
' by contrast , both spatial learning and memory improved in the resveratrol - treated rats			0
' @entity42 said neurogenesis - the growth and development of neurons - approximately doubled in the rats given resveratrol compared to the control rats			0
the resveratrol - treated rats also had significantly improved microvasculature , indicating improved blood flow , and had a lower level of chronic inflammation in the hippocampus			0
' the study provides novel evidence that resveratrol treatment in late middle age can help improve memory and mood function in old age , ' @entity42 said .			2

compound in red grapes *key* in battle against @entity118 's , study finds
peanuts , red wine and some berries also contain the vita antioxidant
