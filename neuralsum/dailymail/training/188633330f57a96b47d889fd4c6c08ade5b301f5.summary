a woman whose vagina was so narrow she could no longer have sex has undergone successful surgery to have it reconstructed - using a pig 's intestine			1
the woman had been sent for treatment after her gynaecologist found she was so narrow it was not even possible to carry out an examination			1
she was referred to the @entity12 in the town of @entity14 , in the western @entity15 doctors there decided to try out the operation after learning that a similar procedure involving pigs intestine could be used on people who had a narrow bladder			1
the woman had been sent for treatment because her vagina was so narrow it was impossible for her gynaecologist to carry out an examination ( file picture ) but they could find no literature or evidence that it had ever been used to help somebody like the young woman , the news agency @entity29 reports			1
she had reported the problem after suffering from scleroderma - a condition that results in hard , thickened areas of skin and sometimes problems with internal organs and blood vessels			1
the condition can cause a woman 's vaginal opening to constrict - making sexual function harder - and can also cause decreased sexual lubrication			1
to try and help the woman , surgeons decided to carry out surgery using a technique called a @entity52			2
this is usually performed on women who have suffered a pelvic organ prolapse and who are experiencing symptoms such as urinary incontinence			0
because prolapse is associated with weakened internal supportive structures , a graft may be placed to strengthen the repair			0

the graft may be made of natural tissue ; such as human donor skin or fascia ; or porcine ( pig ) intestine			1
pig tissue is often used because its genetic make up is similar to that of humans			2
for over 30 years , scientists have been using pigs in a number of medical fields , including dermatology , cardiology and more			0
scientists have even re-grown human leg muscles using implants made of pig bladder tissue			1
during surgery to treat the @entity15 patient , surgeons made an incision to enlarge the narrowed area			1
they then used the mesh - made from pig 's intestine and just 1mm wide - to successfully widen the walls of her vagina			1
over time , human tissue will be created around the net and the pig net will be absorbed by the body			1

and following the success of the operation , the doctors now plan to publish a scientific paper on the technique			0
@entity150 , head doctor of the gynaecological - obstetrical clinic at the hospital , told @entity29 : ' two years ago , the woman started to have problems during sex			2
' the illness had narrowed the vaginal entrance so much that even gynaecological examinations were not possible			0
' dr @entity150 said many women suffer with the same problem - but most are too embarrassed to ask for help			0
he said : ' in the case of the patient we operated on , she had been given various medications by her gynaecologist but nothing helped , so she referred to us			0
' he acknowledged that vaginal surgery was not common and was usually to performed for the opposite problem			0
he added : ' the material used is referred to as pig net			0
' its thickness is about one millimetre			0
' over time human tissue will be created around the net and the pig net will be absorbed by the body			1
' he added that the surgery lasted about one hour and the patient left hospital after five days			0
dr @entity150 said : ' the patient is very happy now			0
the gynaecological examinations are not painful any more			0
dr @entity150 ( right ) , who treated the patient , said many women suffer the same problem - but are too embarrassed to ask for help ' and although we have advised her not to engage in sexual activity at the moment , she should be able to recover a full and active sex life in about two years			1
' basically , she feels like a woman again			0
' @entity195 , a spokesperson for the hospital , confirmed staff had been unable to find any reference to a similar surgery being carried out anywhere else in the world , and believed it was the first of its kind			2
she added : ' if there was anywhere else , as far as we can find out they never published anything about it			0
' it seems we are the first to publish the results of such as surgery in a professional medical publication			0

@entity15 woman had very narrow vagina *due* to the condition scleroderma
problem so *bad* that a gynaecologist could not carry out an examination
in surgery believed to be first of its kind , the area was surgically widened
doctors then *inserted* a mesh made from pig intestine during recovery
1mm - thick mesh keeps area wide while human tissue grows around it
@entity239 will eventually allow the woman to resume sexual activity
