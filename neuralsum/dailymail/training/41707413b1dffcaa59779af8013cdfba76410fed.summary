by @entity0 @entity1 has again proved himself the great survivor by maintaining the support of the one person who can save him from the sack – publicity - shy businessman @entity7			1
@entity9 understands that @entity10 , the chairman of @entity11 , the private equity firm which owns the largest shareholding in @entity13 , has withstood pressure from within the board to remove @entity1 after he was called ' untruthful and corrupt ' by a judge last week			1
although @entity10 , 57 , rarely speaks to reporters and declined to offer public backing for @entity1 , unimpeachable sources have revealed that he remains loyal for two principal reasons			0
staying put : @entity1 , pictured in @entity22 last week , is poised to remain at the helm of @entity13 the first is that @entity1 , with his flair and experience , makes the business more money than anyone else possibly could , and the second that there is nobody lined up to take over			1
therefore , @entity1 will stay in post as @entity13 's chief executive – and all - seeing impresario – unless he is found guilty of bribery in a criminal court case in @entity36 this april			1
however , given that @entity1 is 83 , a replacement must be found some time soon			2
one board member told @entity9 that the only plausible contender is @entity40 , the @entity41 team principal , who was named by @entity1 as his preferred successor last november			1
looking ahead : @entity40 is seen as the only plausible contender to replace the 83 - year - old the two men are close , often dining together			1
@entity40 was one of only a handful of guests at @entity1 's 2012 marriage to @entity49 @entity48			1
but as well as being a confidant of @entity1 , @entity40 is respected within the paddock for the astute manner in which he has harnessed @entity41 owner @entity54 's fortune to win eight titles , drivers ' and constructors ' , in four seasons			2
one well - placed source said : ' there is no doubt @entity62 fits the bill			2
@entity1 is unique and no one can do what he has been doing			0
we need someone with experience of @entity13 , someone who can deal with television rights and commercial contracts			0
the fact that @entity1 would train @entity62 up , in effect , looks like a solution to many of the directors			0
' surviving the axe : @entity1 , pictured here earlier this year , faces trial in a @entity36 court in april @entity1 , who stores every contract in his office , and all the know - how in his head , holds a strong hand with regards to who replaces him and when			1
imposing some corporate type on him would not work			0
@entity88 , the former @entity89 's chief executive , whose son @entity90 is pursuing a career in motor racing , was interviewed by @entity10 but has been categorically discounted as a possible replacement			2
@entity9 understands that , @entity40 apart , none of the handful of names linked with @entity1 's position is remotely under consideration			1
so it seems likely that only a jail sentence in @entity36 , where @entity1 is accused of bribing @entity102 banker @entity101 to sell the sport to @entity11 at an undervalued price , will unseat the octogenarian billionaire in the immediate future			1
moving on : @entity40 has steered @entity41 to eight titles , drivers ' and constructors ' , in four seasons for as well as strong support from @entity10 , @entity1 has the backing of the @entity114 , chairman of @entity115 , the @entity13 board that comprises @entity11 and the other shareholders			1
it is understood that @entity114 was won over by @entity1 's ' genius ' in building palaces out of sand – namely , taking the sport to new venues , such as @entity123 and @entity124 – and making huge profits in the process			0
however , there remains a chance that @entity10 could be swayed into acting sooner if the sport 's other investors , including @entity131 , an @entity133 investment company who hold a 20.9 per cent stake , the @entity133 - based financial firm @entity135 , and @entity136 , who control the @entity140 government 's pension fund , started to fret about @entity1 's probity			2
@entity143 and @entity144 , who also sit on the board , are known to be exercised about the need for good corporate governance , citing the @entity150 compliance law , which acts as a kind of fit - and - proper - person test			0
in the spotlight : @entity154 is likely to oppose @entity40 taking over from @entity1 @entity144 , represented by their president and one of @entity13 's big beasts @entity154 , have publicly called for a summit to plan a future for the sport in the @entity161			1
@entity162 has not been antagonistic towards @entity1 in his pronouncements , but is likely to speak out against @entity40 taking over on the basis that he hails from a rival team			2
@entity1 is still stung by the findings of mr @entity167 last week			0
despite ruling against @entity168 , a @entity102 media firm and former shareholders in @entity13 who believe they lost out because @entity1 bribed @entity101 to sell the sport for less than its market value , @entity167 said @entity1 had lied in evidence			0
' tell me where i lied , ' said @entity1 yesterday			0
' i ca n't see where the evidence is for that			0

@entity1 to remain in post as @entity13 chief executive unless he is found guilty of bribery at @entity182 in @entity36 in april
the 83 - year - old has maintained the support of @entity11 chief @entity7
@entity40 is the only plausible contender to replace @entity1
source tells @entity9 that @entity40 , who 's close to @entity189 , ' fits the bill '
