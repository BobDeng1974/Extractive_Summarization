a new hard - hitting campaign is aiming to highlight the misery of homeless women who are unable to access proper sanitary care			1
the @entity5 project hopes to shred the taboo around females living on the streets and their monthly cycle , and is encouraging people to donate tampons and towels to their local homeless shelter			1
a campaign video tells the story of a woman called @entity17 , who slept rough on the streets of @entity19 for six months and was forced to use makeshift sanitary products while menstruating			1
@entity17 , who used to sleep on the 137 bus in @entity47 , says that when her period came , she would use ' ripped up cloth ' as a sanitary towel			2
she has since been housed in a flat by @entity39 homeless charity spires			0
among the cardboard placards held up are the words : ' why does a woman have to rip up a cloth put between her to protect herself from bleeding ? ' another is written with the words : ' i used to feel very depressed			1
it used to get me down			0
' the project was started by @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , who met while working as interns at an advertising agency			1
the trio told @entity63 that they began the campaign as a way of drawing attention to the amount of women who live on the streets after realising that society considered homelessness to be a ' male ' issue			1
the campaign has prompted supporters to start their own collection boxes for tampons and sanitary towels : this ( pictured above ) was one of seven boxes collected in the workplace of @entity83 user @entity82 while homeless shelters receive funding for condoms , there is currently no government funding to supply charities with aid for sanitary products they said that they were surprised to find that approximately 26 per cent of people who access homelessness services are women			1
@entity33 adds that periods seem to be a forgotten issue when it comes to living on the streets			1
' it 's that for many people , it 's never even crossed their minds			0
as we say on the campaign site " it does n't bear thinking about â€¦ and that 's the problem "			0
' while there is public funding for condoms to be supplied to homeless shelters , there is no financial aid for tampons and sanitary towels			2
nearly 81,000 people have signed a petition to lobby the government for better funding to buy sanitary care			1
@entity33 says he hopes that the petition will ' promise a more long term solution to the issue , and the amount of funding it would need is relatively small			2
' the group aims to present the petition to the secretary of health or if they reach their 150,000 signature target before a new government is elected , then to lobby @entity129 , chief executive of the @entity130			0
a campaign video includes the voice of @entity17 , who lived for six months on the streets of @entity19			2
she says she was forced to used ripped up cloth as a makeshift sanitary towel @entity33 said donations are key to the campaign 's success : ' for us , the hope is that # @entity141 will become a platform for people wanting to help with donations			1
' we 've had people from around the country contact us with their own local initiatives and fundraisers for the campaign			2
our side is in promoting those efforts and connecting them with other people who want to help			0
' supporters have been dropping boxes of tampons and towels into their local homeless shelters , with one donor , @entity82 , so inspired that she has set up a crowd - funding page to encourage more people to donate			0
on her gofundme page , @entity161 says : ' i recently read an article about the lives of homeless women and the difficulties they face when they have their period			0
' i had never really thought about it that way before , these women have little or no access to sanitary products			0
i decided to do something and did a collection in my workplace which got an amazing response			0

campaign focuses on lack of sanitary care for women living rough
