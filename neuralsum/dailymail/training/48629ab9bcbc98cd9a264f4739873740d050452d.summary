the @entity0 is in discussions with the @entity2 about how to make it easier to choose the most exciting @entity5 fixtures to broadcast live			1
the broadcaster received criticism for not showing @entity10 's shock 2 - 0 victory over @entity11 in the @entity5 fifth round on sunday , electing instead to show @entity14 's match against @entity15			1
@entity0 football editor @entity16 released a statement on monday afternoon which can be read in full below			2
@entity18 ( centre ) fires @entity10 ahead with the help of a deflection during their victory over @entity11 @entity23 ( right ) seals the tie with a neat finish to complete the @entity5 fifth round giant killing @entity28 was the mastermind of yet another cup shock with @entity10 at the @entity30 the statement comes after @entity33 presenter @entity32 on sunday night moved to clarify why the @entity0 had not shown @entity10 's @entity5 giant killing against @entity11 live on tv			1
@entity10 striker @entity23 joked during his post-match interview for @entity0 that the game at @entity30 was ' a great cup tie ' and that it ' should have been on the tv ' , a comment that left the interviewer lost for words			1
back in the studio @entity32 revealed the reason why @entity44 's conquerors from the previous round had not been shown live , despite the opportunity of another upset being on the cards			1
' i do have an answer on that subject , ' the presenter said			0
' and it comes from the @entity0 football management who say the following : ' they had to pick their live games before the replays were played in the fourth round and therefore could n't be sure who @entity10 would be at home to			1
if they had been allowed to wait they would have chosen it '			0
' @entity32 confirmed on @entity65 that @entity10 was not selected for tv because the @entity0 had to choose the live games before their opponents were known @entity69 joked during his post-match interview that the fifth - round tie against @entity11 should have been shown on tv @entity11 needed a replay to beat @entity74 side @entity73 in the fourth round and the @entity0 had to select the live games before the tie was decided , with the corporation instead opting to show the all @entity79 clash between @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity80 had earlier claimed the @entity0 would have screened @entity10 's fifth - round game had their opponents been known prior to the fourth - round replays			1
and the @entity84 side did n't let him forget it by posting a cheeky tweet aimed at @entity86 and @entity32 following the @entity11 win			1
the presenter tweeted : ' the @entity0 can only show 2 ties in each round and select them pre replays			1
if they could 've waited @entity10 would obviously have been chosen			2
' @entity80 and @entity32 were subject to a cheeky tweet from @entity10 following their victory @entity97 presenter @entity32 was also targeted by @entity10 's cheeky tweet the tv match selections for the 5th round of the @entity5 caused a bit of a reaction yesterday , so i wanted to use this post to explain in a bit more detail how the selection process works			1
you still might not agree with our picks , particularly if you 're from @entity10 , but hopefully you 'll see there 's a bit of logic to what we try to do			2
as @entity80 mentioned yesterday , the hardest thing is that both the @entity0 and @entity116 have to make our selections before the outcome of replays			0
that 's the only reason why @entity28 's side did n't get a live match this time round			1
we had to weigh up the options and given @entity11 's recent form , thought it was a realistic possibility of the match being @entity84 against a @entity74 side			1
in this case it would n't have been much of a shock whatever the result and the winners would be guaranteed a live quarter - final , as @entity134 have done by progressing at @entity135			0
if @entity10 definitely had a home tie against @entity79 opposition we certainly would have chosen to have the match live on @entity0			1
that has been a big part of our policy so far , showing @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and tonight @entity144 , all looking to overcome opposition from the top flight			0
as the game unfolded yesterday at @entity30 , we shared the frustration of fans and would have loved to have been broadcasting the match live			2
it 's everything the @entity5 and our new comprehensive coverage is about			2
we are speaking to the fa about whether we can change this in the future , but understand it 's tricky for them			0
clubs understandably want to get plans for ticketing , policing and fans in place without waiting for 10 days for tv companies to confirm their selections			0
but we hope there 's a middle ground where we can get a little more flexibility to ensure we have as much chance as possible of capturing cup classics like yesterday			0
of course a lot of things are easy in hindsight			0
we have been really pleased with most of our picks so far and really fortunate to get some proper cup shocks			0
@entity174 from the eighth tier overcoming @entity176 , @entity177 winning in dramatic fashion at @entity179 , @entity141 running @entity181 close and @entity142 holding @entity182 under the @entity184 lights			0
it 's also great to see the difference the tv money can make to these clubs , as well as placing them in the national spotlight with over 7 million viewers tuning in			0
our audience research also suggests that fans want to enjoy a mix of these @entity196 matches and games involving @entity79 sides			0
for those who ca n't afford subscription to sports channels , it 's been great to be able to see live international stars like @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 , all as part of the licence fee			0
while the @entity14 vs. @entity15 game was n't everyone 's cup of tea , it was a hotly contested @entity217 derby with both clubs picking full strength sides and produced a cracking second half watched by over 4 million			1
of course , we would have loved to have been live at @entity44 in the 4th round and @entity10 in the 5th , but the good news for fans is that even when a game is n't shown live there 's always comprehensive @entity65 highlights available			2
there 's a lot more extra coverage devoted to the @entity5 on the @entity0 , with lots of additional content and different ways to enjoy it			2
after the 4th round , 26 million people had watched the coverage on the @entity0 , that 's 8 million more than on terrestrial tv this time last season			2
it 's not all about viewing figures and ratings , but it 's pleasing to be able to bring coverage of the world 's most loved cup competition to such a wide audience			0
despite some of the criticism coming out of @entity10 , a lot of thought goes into the matches we pick , and i hope the selections outlined above show we are particularly keen to showcase clubs outside the @entity79			2
i 'm a @entity256 fan myself so know all too well what the cup can mean to those outside the elite			0
when we sit down tomorrow morning to pick our two matches for the quarter - final we will take all i 've discussed into consideration , but the good news is that all four matches will be live on tv			0
that means @entity10 's incredible heroics over the last five rounds have guaranteed them a money - spinning quarter - final game and boy do @entity275 fans deserve it !			1

the @entity0 received criticism for not showing @entity10 's shock victory against @entity11 in the @entity5 fifth round on sunday

the @entity275 comfortably beat @entity284 's side 2 - 0 at the @entity30
@entity33 presenter @entity32 on sunday night moved to clarify why the @entity0 had not shown @entity10 's @entity5 victory
