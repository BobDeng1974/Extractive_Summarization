by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:23 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 02:35 est , 30 october 2012 up to 5,000 mental health patients could have been sectioned in the last decade by doctors who had not been properly approved , @entity2 revealed today			1
the health secretary said emergency legislation would be drawn up after discovering ‘ irregularities ’ in the way as many as 2,000 doctors were authorised to assess patients for detention under the 1983 @entity10			1
since 2002 , doctors in four regions had been sending patients to mental health institutions – including the @entity17 and @entity18 secure hospitals , home to some of @entity23 ’s most notorious prisoners – without being properly cleared			1
health secretary @entity2 said 2,000 doctors in four regions were not legally cleared to section patients the serious error only came to light last week , but mr @entity2 insisted no - one had been locked up who should not have been			1
doctors were supposed to have been approved to detain patients under the @entity10 by @entity31			2
but in four areas - @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , @entity37 ; and @entity38 – authorisation was delegated to local mental health trusts			2
dr @entity40 , chairman of @entity41 , will undertake an independent review to look ' at how this responsibility was delegated ' by the four @entity31			0
mr @entity2 told the @entity44 : ‘ our latest best estimate is that 2,000 doctors were not properly approved and that they have participated in the detention of between 4,000 and 5,000 current patients within institutions in both the @entity41 and independent sectors			1
‘ there is no suggestion that hospitalisation or detention of any patient has been clinically inappropriate , nor that the doctors so approved are anything other than properly qualified to make such recommendations , nor that these doctors might have made incorrect diagnoses or decisions about the treatment patients need			1
‘ all the proper clinical processes were gone through when these patients were detained			0
we believe no - one is in hospital who should n’t be , and no patients have suffered because of this			0
’ he said doctors recommending patients to be locked up would not have known they had not been properly approved to make such recommendations and had ‘ acted in good faith ’			0
@entity75 agreed to back to the government in changing the law			0
shadow health secretary @entity78 said : ' detaining people under the @entity10 raises the most serious issues of fundamental rights and of patient and public safety			1
' any reported failure will therefore always be a matter of the highest concern			0
' he praised mr @entity2 's ' pragmatic approach ... to this difficult issue '			2
mr @entity90 added : ' failure to act would potentially cause unnecessary distress and uncertainty to many thousands of vulnerable patients and their families and present risks to public safety			0
' so while we will press him for answers , his action is justified , and he will have our support in removing any uncertainty			0
