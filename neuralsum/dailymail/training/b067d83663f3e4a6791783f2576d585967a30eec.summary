by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 04:08 est , 16 august 2013 an illegal immigrant who wants to serve in the military might seem an odd choice for a major national ad campaign			1
but young @entity6 - born @entity5 seemed perfect to @entity8 ceo @entity7 who picked him as the face of an ad pushing for immigration reform			1
the pitch is part of the tech industry - backed @entity27 , a political action committee co-founded by the 29 - year - old billionaire owner of the social network site that is devoted to immigration issues			1
it is the first to focus on the fight waged by ' @entity34 ' for immigration reform			0
its star , @entity36 , came to the @entity16 illegally with his parents when he was seven months old and settled in @entity39			2
he served in the @entity40 , or @entity40 , in high school and earned the high ranking of @entity43 brigadier general during his senior year			0
he can not serve in the military , however , because of his immigration status			0
' i do want to give back			0
i believe 100 percent in what this country stands for , " @entity36 says in the ad			0
" let me earn it			0
' ' we are running this ad to put a very human face on our broken immigration system , ' said @entity27 president @entity56 , who co-founded @entity27 with @entity7 , in a statement			1
' we hope that by showing @entity16 the cost of this broken system and the contributions people like @entity5 are already making , they will join with us in supporting real reform			1
' @entity66 : ' serve ' , the advert highlighting @entity36 's story , is said to have cost a six - figure sum motivated : @entity7 , @entity8 ceo , co-founded the national campaign for immigration reform @entity27 honour : the video describes how @entity36 became the highest ranking cadet in @entity73 and wants to serve his county in the @entity75 justice : the campaign is seeking to change immigration laws in the @entity16 to give long - term residents more rights @entity81 : ' serve ' highlights how the @entity6 - born soldier has already been decorated for services to the @entity16 military opportunity : ' i just want a chance to show everyone out there that i am @entity16 ' , says @entity36 in the video the ad strikes a notably different tone from other ads backed by @entity27			1
the political advocacy group was embroiled in controversy earlier this year when it funded ads that touted the conservative bona fides of senators that support immigration reform , including senators @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
the ad for @entity100 lauded his support of the @entity105 , while the ad for @entity101 highlighted his support for drilling in the @entity109			0
the ad will run in tv broadcast markets in border states and large cities , such as @entity114 , @entity39 and @entity115 the controversial ads prompted protests from environmentalists and progressive groups , who temporarily boycotted purchasing ads on @entity8			0
@entity122 , ceo of electric car maker @entity123 , publicly quit @entity27 after the ads ran			2
@entity27 , which has an a-list of tech donors , including @entity128 ceo @entity127 and @entity130 executive chairman @entity129 , has recently expanded its push for immigration reform beyond the tech industry 's fight for more high - skilled visas and green cards for foreign graduates of @entity16 universities			1
earlier this week , it teamed up with journalist @entity139 's immigrant rights group @entity139 to cohost the premiere of ' documented , ' a film directed by @entity139 that tells the stories of ' dreamers ' like himself who are fighting to gain @entity16 citizenship			1
@entity7 gave remarks at the film 's premiere in @entity151 , which drew a crowd of tech executives , including @entity8 chief operating officer @entity154 and @entity156 founder @entity155			1
wearing his trademark hoodie and sneakers , he disputed the notion that he and other @entity161 leaders are just trying to secure more h1b visas for high - tech workers			1
' this is something that we believe is really important for the future of our country - and for us to do what 's right , ' @entity7 told several hundred attendees , including @entity172 minority leader @entity171 and @entity151 mayor @entity173 , at the @entity174			1
defence : @entity7 first spoke publicly in @entity151 at the debut screening of ' documented , ' an autobiographical documentary by activist and journalist @entity139 , right @entity7 and his former @entity181 roommate @entity56 recently founded the organization @entity27 to advocate for a pathway to citizenship for nearly 11 million immigrants living in the @entity16 illegally			1
the screening was the first time @entity7 spoke about the issue in public			2
the @entity8 founder said he first became aware of the need to change the immigration system while volunteering to teach a class on entrepreneurship at a @entity196 school			0
many of the students had been brought into the @entity16 illegally			2
' no matter where they were born , ( these students ) are going to be tomorrow 's entrepreneurs and people creating jobs in this country , ' he told the audience			2
' these are issues that do n't just touch our part of the industry , but really touch a whole country			0
' in april , @entity7 teamed up with other @entity161 leaders to launch @entity27 , with the aim of revamping immigration policy , boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research			1
website : @entity27 , @entity7 said , was created ' to build the knowledge economy the @entity16 needs to ensure more jobs , innovation and investment '			1
' my great - grandparents came through @entity223			0
' my grandfathers were a mailman and a police officer			0
' my parents are doctors			0
' none of this could have happened without a welcoming immigration policy , a great education system and the world ’s leading scientific community that created the internet			0
' in an op - ed article in the @entity237 at the time , @entity7 said the @entity16 needs a new approach to these issues if it is to get ahead economically			1
this , he wrote , includes offering talented , skilled immigrants a path to citizenship			0
' we have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants , @entity7 wrote			2
' and it 's a policy unfit for today 's world			0
' of @entity254 extraction , @entity7 's interest in immigration stems from the fact that his own great - grandparents arrived as immigrants via @entity223 , to @entity16 , coupled with his experience teaching entrepreneurship at an after - school program			1
at the top of the @entity27 website it explains in bite - sized facts just why immigration is important to the future of @entity16 and reminds users that : ' 40 per cent of @entity268 companies were founded by immigrants or their children ' and that ' 57 % of engineering grad students are immigrants			1
many will have to leave if we do n’t pass comprehensive immigration reform			0
' @entity7 also called for higher standards and accountability in schools and increased focus on learning about science , technology , engineering and maths			2
today 's knowledge and ideas - based economy , the 28 - year - old @entity181 dropout wrote , is very different from the economy of the 20th century that was based on natural resources , industrial machines and labor			2
@entity27 , he said , was created ' to build the knowledge economy the @entity16 needs to ensure more jobs , innovation and investment			1
' also backing the group are tech leaders such as @entity298 , @entity300 ceo @entity299 , serial entrepreneur @entity301 , as well as @entity302 of @entity303 , who was @entity8 's first female engineer			2
major contributors to the political group include @entity130 chairman @entity129 ( left ) and @entity128 ceo @entity127 ( right )			0

@entity6 - born immigrant who wants to work in the military to front new ad
six - figure ad forms part of @entity7 's reform drive and campaign website @entity27
' human face ' marks fresh approach after claims that @entity161 leaders just trying to secure more @entity324 visas for high - tech workers
@entity7 @entity16 needs to embrace immigrants if it is to get ahead economically
he has been teaching entrepreneurship classes and is *saddened* by limited further education opportunities for his students without documentation
