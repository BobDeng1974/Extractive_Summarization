no need to remember : the revolutionary pill contains a chip that could end the need for passwords and paper forms of id for forgetful types , it promises to be a new wonder pill			1
but far from boosting the memory , the tiny swallowable capsules contain a minute chip that transmits an individual ’s personal details			2
electronic devices will be able to read the unique signal , ending the need for passwords and paper forms of @entity6 , such as passports - and freeing users from such mundane tasks as recalling countless codes and security answers			1
already approved by the both the @entity25 and @entity26 regulators , the ingestible sensor is powered by a battery using the acid in the wearer ’s stomach			1
each pill is designed to move through the body at the normal process of digestion , and according to engineers working on the device , it can be taken every day for up to a month			2
based on a technology developed by @entity40 - based @entity39 , it contains a computer chip and a switch , which is activated when it comes in contact with acid in the user ’s body			1
it then sends a tiny signal that can be read by mobile devices and allows them to verify the identity of an individual			1
the controversial pill is being championed by @entity56 executive , @entity55 , once dubbed ‘ @entity58 ’s smartest engineer ’			1
‘ essentially , your entire body becomes your authentication token , ’ she said			0
she was the first female director of the @entity58 government ’s spy technology agency @entity62 ( @entity62 ) before joining @entity66 ’s @entity65 division last year			2
speaking at a conference last month , she said : ‘ authentication is irritating			0
in fact it ’s so irritating only about half the people do it			0
‘ despite the fact there is a lot of information about you on your smartphone , which makes you far more prone to identity theft			0
‘ after 40 years of advances in computation , we ’re still authenticating the same way we did years ago - passwords			0
in fact it ’s worse , the average users does it 39 times a day and it takes them 2.3 seconds every time they do it			0
controversial : the new technology has been created by @entity39 who are planning to create electronic tattoos that can hold personal data ‘ power users will do it up to 100 times a day			1
so what are we doing about it ? well [ @entity56 ] is thinking of a whole variety of options for how to do better at authentication such as near - term things including tokens or fobs that have @entity105 or bluetooth			0
‘ but you can also think about a means of authentication you can wear on your skin every day , say an electronic tattoo or a vitamin pill			2
’ the company is also exploring the use electronic tattoos that contain personal verification data .			0

electronic devices can read a unique signal coming from a chip in the pill
