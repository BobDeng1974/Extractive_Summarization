a place back in the top four is within @entity3 's grasp if he can continue his fine end to a difficult season at the @entity6 in @entity7			1
the 27 - year - old slipped as low as 12 in the rankings after the @entity10 but winning three trophies during a run of six successive tournaments has lifted him back up to number six			2
@entity3 appears finally to have overcome the lingering effects of back surgery last year , with both his fitness and confidence levels prompting hopes he could follow his @entity22 triumph by winning again on home soil at the @entity24			2
@entity3 practices his serve at the @entity24 ahead of his first game in the @entity6 @entity3 has been excellent over the past few years to qualify for the event , and is now looking to win it he currently sits 420 points behind out - of - form @entity30 champion @entity29 in fourth and , with 1,500 points up for grabs to an unbeaten champion in @entity7 , there is the potential for @entity3 to make significant strides			1
a top - four seeding for the @entity30 in january would mean @entity3 could not play @entity39 , @entity40 or @entity41 until the semi-finals			1
@entity3 said : ' i 'll obviously try to finish in the top four if i can but a few weeks ago it was , ' will he finish in the top 10 ? ' ' i 'd love to get there but it 's all a process			2
with most things in my career , they 've happened quite gradually so i 'm not expecting to finish in the top four			2
coach @entity52 watches @entity3 practice as he looks to break back into the worlds top four @entity3 is up against the top eight men in the world , with the exception of @entity41 , in @entity7 ' if i do , it would be a very good effort after the last few weeks			1
it 's been a tough year in a lot of respects so i 'll try my best to have a good event and get some good wins under my belt			2
' @entity3 's reward for battling his way into the eight - man field at the @entity24 is a round - robin group also featuring @entity40 and newcomers @entity70 and @entity72			1
@entity3 opens the tournament on sunday afternoon against @entity10 runner - up @entity70 , the man who sits immediately above him in the rankings			1
' he 's made big improvements this year in his game and his ranking , he 's won a number of tournaments , he 's had a lot of matches but also quite a few injuries , ' said the @entity84			2
' he 's played some very good tennis this year			0
he 's a young guy and he 's going to keep getting better over the next couple of years			0
' @entity70 , @entity3 's opponent on sunday , has never beaten the @entity84 in their three meetings the eight players pose for a selfie , taken by @entity92 star @entity91 , before the tournament gets underway @entity70 , 24 , has yet to take a set off @entity3 in three previous meetings but the most recent of those was almost two years ago			1
the @entity98 player said : ' i think he 's going to be one of the toughest opponents for me because i have n't beaten him			0
he beat me already three times and he 's one of the toughest players on the tour			0
' and especially he 's from here and he 's got the home crowd so it 's not going to be easy for me			0
but i think this is a little bit of a different situation because i 've been playing one of the best years of my career and beating top - 10 , top - five guys already			0
' i do n't think it 's like i ca n't beat him so , if i can play good tennis , i think i will have some chance to win			0
' sunday evening 's match sees @entity40 take on @entity72 , and victories for both @entity40 and @entity3 would set up a clash between them on tuesday			1
@entity70 is confident of victory over @entity3 after a season in which he has played his best ever tennis @entity3 admits that he has had a tough year , as he conceded after qualifying for the end of season event winning the group will be important to try to avoid @entity39 , who is on a 27 - match winning run indoors , in the semi-finals			1
@entity3 and @entity40 have played each other three times at the @entity24 since the tournament moved to @entity7 in 2009 , with the @entity132 winning on each occasion			1
@entity3 cited @entity40 's record as one of the best indoor players of all time , but @entity40 said : ' i was actually quite surprised how well i 've played him here in the past because i thought it was going to be hard , i thought maybe on a couple of occasions i was probably going to lose			1
' but things went very well for me			0
i do n't feel necessarily the surface is crazy helpful for me or for him , i think it 's a very even court for any player			0
' he plays well indoors so there 's no reason for him not to do very well here			0
i 've had a difficult head - to - head against him and clearly playing him in @entity7 is a more difficult challenge than somewhere else in the world			0
' @entity152 was n't himself the first few months of the year , there was no doubt it took him a while to get fully fit again after the surgery and so i 'm very happy for him that he 's doing so well again now at the end of the year .			0

@entity3 starts @entity6 against @entity70 on sunday
@entity3 could rise as high as @entity160 4 if he wins tournament
top four spot would ensure he avoids @entity39 , @entity41 and @entity40 before the semi-finals of the @entity30 next year
