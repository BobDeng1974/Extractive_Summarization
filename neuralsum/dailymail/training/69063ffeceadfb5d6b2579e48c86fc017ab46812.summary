remember , remember the fifth of november			2
for that was the day @entity2 broke a million hearts by declaring himself engaged to be married to his girlfriend , @entity4			1
the 38 - year - old actor ’s crisp announcement came in the @entity8 section of the @entity10 newspaper , one line of nuptial intent that sent fans into meltdown			1
first , the ultimate bachelor @entity16 gets married — and now @entity17 in wedlock shock ? well , i am afraid so , ladies			2
the bad news just keeps on coming			2
@entity2 has found true love after a whirlwind romance ? please , please , say it ’s not so ! ‘ i feel like crying , ’ tweeted one fan			2
‘ how could he ? ’ said another			2
yet , from the sidelines , millions more looked on in bemusement , wondering what on earth all the fuss was about			2
for even though @entity2 was dubbed one of @entity48 ’s most eligible bachelors by @entity49 in 2012 and regularly appears on @entity51 lists , not everyone is bowled over by his odd , vulpine features and singular charm			1
indeed , many men grumpily wonder exactly what it is about this lanky toff with the gingery tinge that inspires such breathless devotion among his loyal fan base			2
even by @entity2 ’s own admission he looks like an otter — or a ‘ muppet otter ’ , as some of his more delirious fans insist			2
those who do n’t feel the @entity69 - love believe he might actually be an alien who lives in an underwater cave			1
and that he is cold - hearted and sinister , with tiny halibut eyes and a freckled , cadaverous mien			1
closer examination would quite possibly reveal webbing between the cumber - toes and a secret , collapsible shark fin on his @entity81 - spine — an aquatic aide that is unfurled only when he goes @entity81 - swimming			1
the actor sent his fans into meltdown after announcing he would be marrying his girlfriend @entity4			1
the pair are pictured together at the @entity88 earlier this year @entity2 even flew to @entity89 to visit his girlfriend ’s mother , especially to ask for a parental blessing and permission to marry his @entity4 , whom he has known for five years but has been dating for five months then there are others , like me , who totally understand his appeal			1
@entity2 — as i like to call him — may not be classically handsome , but handsome he undoubtedly is			0
that high , broad forehead ; those kindly eyes ; the strange lips that look as if they were painted by @entity102 and would leave a diamond - shaped imprint on your neck , a brand of love that gently burned into your skin like a			1
where was i ? oh , yes			0
so these are the traits that women respond to , that have made the former public schoolboy an international heartthrob			0
more than this , there is also something unquenchably noble about @entity2 , an inbuilt sense of grace and the strong suspicion that whatever the right thing is to do , he would selflessly do it in a heartbeat			0
intelligent and self - deprecating , the @entity125 - person is a trumpet among today ’s celebrity tin whistles , a he - giant in a world of lost boys with gelled hair and silly shoes			1
a proper grown - up , he even flew to @entity89 to visit his girlfriend ’s mother , especially to ask for a parental blessing and permission to marry his @entity4			1
so darling ! he is the kind of man who would swirl his @entity141 over a puddle so that a lady — any lady — did not get her feet wet			0
no wonder his devotees are so upset			0
when the news broke , thousands of them got together on social media to agree that their lives were ruined , shattered , not worth living any more , basically over , kaput , kill me now , it is the end of days			1
the actor ’s devoted fangirls , the hardcore obsessives who call themselves the @entity156 , plunged through the five stages of grief in various public forums			1
@entity2 was dubbed one of @entity48 ’s most eligible bachelors by @entity49 in 2012 and regularly appears on @entity51 lists i must say , it was quite entertaining			0
there was denial ( ‘ nooo ! ’ ) , anger ( ‘ i hate him now ’ ) , bargaining ( ‘ does he secretly still love me ? ’ ) , depression ( ‘ i have no tears left to shed ’ ) and a kind of acceptance ( ‘ let us now grief - eat in an orderly fashion ’ )			1
they were mourning a man whom they had never met but with whom they had somehow convinced themselves they had a shot			0
then he went and got engaged to someone who was n’t them , just like that snake @entity16 did			1
within the boundaries of the fragile , fairytale relationship that exists between star and fan , it almost makes it worse that both these hugely eligible stars chose ordinary women — or , at least , women who were not red carpet - ready @entity195 actresses — to share their lives with			1
it feeds the @entity200 myth and adds fuel to the notion , however fanciful , that it could have been a @entity203 up there with @entity2 ’s ring on her finger			0
not that there is anything ordinary about human rights lawyer @entity211 , with her gazelle legs and international rescue mission to save the @entity214			0
by marrying @entity16 , she ’s already got her hands on a fabulous old artefact			1
is n’t is just plain greedy to want another one ? fans have been avidly following @entity2 since his 2010 breakthrough in the @entity223 series @entity17 , in which he stars with @entity224 and beautiful bluestocking @entity4 is very far from ordinary , too			1
a former actress who first met @entity2 on the set of the 2009 film @entity229 , she is better known as an award - winning opera and theatre director who writes plays in her spare time			1
gah ! if anything , the 36 - year - old @entity237 graduate is even posher than he is , which is , as @entity240 once pointed out , really saying something			1
how romantic that both of them had been in long - term relationships before , had known each other through work for five years but only started dating earlier this year and quickly realised they were in love			1
my dear @entity248 , when you know , you just know			0
the fans , who have been avidly following @entity2 since his 2010 breakthrough in the @entity223 series @entity17 , will just have to get used to the new status quo and accept that the guillotine of reality has sliced down on their @entity200 daydreams			0
as far as @entity260 is concerned , the glass slipper has been smashed for ever			0
the 38 - year - old actor ’s crisp announcement came in the @entity8 section of the @entity10 newspaper , one line of nuptial intent that sent fans into meltdown however , there are consolations			1
@entity2 may be off the market , but he will be in the spotlight more and more			0
he is incredibly talented , so much so that i am hoping he is going to be the next @entity274			0
why not ? he is the quintessential quirky @entity275 , someone who can project the necessary nerves of steel , courage of a lion and chip of ice lodged in his dark , @entity284 heart			0
who else would you want to be snuggled up to in a foxhole under fire from the enemy ? @entity2 is his own man , he goes his own way			0
uniquely , he is a very old - fashioned sort of matinee idol ; a man who knows how to wear a tuxedo and to shoot his cuffs			2
and perhaps the most curious thing about him is that despite his other - worldly appearance , he always looks just right in any time zone , from futuristic sci - fi films to playing a @entity301 officer in @entity302			2
so what next for the @entity304 ? they will recover			0
they will have to recover			0
they can always join the queue at @entity309 to pay homage to , and take selfies with , @entity2 ’s new wax effigy			0
unveiled last month and depicting the actor in a pose of typically roguish grandeur , it has already proved hugely popular with those who come only to worship and cry			2
but some @entity156 can also be selfless			0
‘ who wants @entity2 to go home to an empty house at night ? ’ one tweeted through her tears this week			0

the 38 - year - old actor shattered hearts when he announced he was engaged
*sherlock* star is marrying @entity4 , whom he has dated for 5 months
but not everyone is bowled over by his vulpine features and singular charm
