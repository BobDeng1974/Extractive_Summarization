by @entity1 reporter published : 06:46 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 07:51 est , 2 july 2012 a @entity3 father has been offered the chance of a life - saving kidney from a distant cousin in @entity7 - after he wrote about his plight on @entity9			1
@entity10 , 44 , has polycystic kidney disease and has been undergoing dialysis every day for the last year as he waits for a new donor organ			2
he began documenting his illness on the popular social networking site and was stunned when he received a message from a distant cousin who lives in @entity7			2
amazing offer : @entity19 ( left ) has come forward as a potential kidney donor for his distant cousin @entity21 , pictured with his daughter @entity22 aged 2 and his wife @entity23 @entity19 - who has only met @entity21 on two occasions - wrote offer to be a live donor for his cousin			1
when @entity21 accepted , the advertising account manager took a holiday from his job and flew to the @entity3 to undergo tests to see whether his kidney is suitable			2
@entity19 , 41 , and @entity21 , a father - of - one , now face an anxious wait to see whether the transplant can go ahead - and so far doctors say it is looking promising			1
@entity21 , a musician who lives in @entity37 , @entity38 , with wife @entity23 , 42 and daughter @entity39 , two , said he was ' amazed ' at the generousity of his cousin			2
he said : ' we do n’t actually know each other that well , having grown up on different sides of the @entity44 , but we became friends on @entity9 a couple of years ago			0
' @entity19 saw that i was in need of a new kidney , and offered to be a living donor			1
' it ’s one of those things where it ’s difficult to find the words			0
it ’s a mixture of gratitude and just thankfulness that he ’s come forward to help			0
' i know from my previous transplant the difference it makes to me having a healthy working kidney , it ’s just indescribable			0
' family matters : @entity7 cousin @entity19 is 3rd from left ( in yellow ) while @entity21 is on his right			1
@entity21 's dad @entity67 is standing with baby on back , while @entity19 's day is standing far right a collect of @entity21 with his daughter @entity22			1
@entity19 said seeing photos of them on @entity9 prompted him to try and help @entity19 ’s dad also called @entity19 was brother of @entity21 ’s father @entity67			1
they were two of four brothers who grew up in @entity78 , @entity79			0
in the early 1960s , @entity19 got married to @entity80 who said a condition of their marriage was to move abroad to get away from her mother			2
so @entity19 and @entity80 moved to @entity87 where @entity21 ’s cousin , @entity19 , who was one of four children , was born in 1970			1
the cousins first met when @entity21 , then aged 11 , and his family went to stay in @entity87 with @entity19 , then aged nine , and his family in 1979			1
@entity19 later moved to @entity7 with his family in 1981 where he has stayed ever since			1
the pair did not have any contact for more than 20 years until 2003 , when they met at @entity21 ’s uncle and @entity19 ’s father ’s second wedding - but the pair only spoke briefly			1
around two years ago they befriended each other on @entity9 and used the social networking site to send messages and view each other ’s photographs			0
@entity21 ’s condition is a hereditary disease which his mother , who also went on dialysis , suffered @entity110 was diagnosed at 21 but only started showing symptoms in his 30s and finally went on dialysis at 38			2
@entity21 ( left ) with @entity19 : doctors are checking whether @entity19 is physically and psychologically suitable @entity21 was on daily dialysis for 18 months before a kidney donor came forward in august 2007			1
however , that kidney failed last year and he is now back on dialysis			0
he started using a new phone app called @entity120 for his iphone in december which allows users to check - in to visited places			0
@entity21 said he was playing around with the app while at hospital one day which alerted his @entity9 friends , including his cousin @entity19 , that he was on dialysis again			1
he then continued to use the social networking website to update friends and family on his condition			0
just a month later in january , @entity21 received an unexpected message from his cousin - offering him one of his kidneys			2
@entity21 said : ' it was completely out of the blue			2
we had n’t been in close contact over the years			0
' @entity19 said he was moved to offer his kidney to @entity21 after seeing photographs of his cousin with daughter @entity39			1
the father - of - five and grandfather - of - two said : ' seeing @entity21 ’s situation online , and seeing pictures of him with his daughter @entity39 , i felt moved , and there was a little voice in my head that said , ‘ you should do this ’			2
' having very young daughters at home as well , i understand how much energy it takes to have young children in the house and how difficult that must be for @entity21			0
' by monitoring @entity21 ’s situation - seeing his updates and seeing him check into certain health clinics during his dialysis - and then seeing pictures of his daughter , i felt a connection between the two and it was just a feeling in me that told me it was something i should do			0
' in the grand scheme of things it does n’t feel like a sacrifice			1
there are very few opportunities in life to do something meaningful for somebody else			0
' i wanted to do something not just for @entity21 , who has a compromised standard of life , but for @entity39 as well			0
' family tree : the @entity19 brothers , ( @entity181 ) @entity19 ( @entity7 @entity19 's father ) @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity67 ( @entity21 's father ) grew up in @entity78 @entity19 , from @entity186 , flew into the @entity3 on june 24 and returned to @entity7 on june 30			1
he underwent tests at @entity188 in @entity189 to check that his kidney is suitable			0
the process is overseen by @entity192 , one of the living donor transplant co-ordinators at @entity188 ’s @entity194			1
she said : ' it ’s a really rigorous investigation process and the donor ’s safety is of the highest priority to us			0
' if anything is found to be unsuitable , whether psychologically or physically , then we stop the whole process			0
we ’d love to give a kidney transplant to everyone who needs one , but not at any anyone else ’s expense			0

@entity21 had only seen his @entity7 cousin twice before @entity19 offered to donate his kidney as a living donor
@entity19 said : ' in the grand scheme of things it does *n't* feel like a sacrifice '
