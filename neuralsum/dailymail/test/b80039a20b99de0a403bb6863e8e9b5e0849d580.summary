a tiny oil painting that was kept in an attic for years and thought to be worth just £ 300 has now sold for more than £ 120,000 at auction			1
the oil painting - which measures nine inches by seven - of a catholic saint was believed to be the work of a ' follower ' of 16th century renaissance master @entity7			1
but the selling price suggests the untitled , undated and unsigned painting may actually have been done by the artist himself			1
@entity15 @entity14 ( pictured ) gave the tiny painting an estimated value of about £ 300 to £ 400 but it ended up selling for more than £ 120,000 it was acquired by the owner 's late father in the 1970s for very little			1
he bought it because he believed it was a depiction of @entity23 , who shares his name			0
and it was inherited by his son , who has not been named , who kept it in his loft for the past eight years before deciding to sell it following a clear - out			0
@entity15 @entity14 , of @entity31 of @entity32 , @entity33 , gave the work an estimated value of between £ 300 and £ 400			1
but after advertising the sale , interest in the work took off			1
and feverish bidding , final hammer price was £ 98,000 and came to £ 120,932 with all the fees added on			1
mr @entity14 said : ' i rung the client after the sale and just told him it sold for ninety - eight			0
he asked ' what pounds ? ' and i told him it was £ 98,000			2
' he said he needed to sit down			0
when he came down off the ceiling he was very , very pleased			0
i think if he had been offered £ 500 for it before the auction he would have snapped your hand off			2
' the oil painting ( right ) was believed to have been the work of a follower of 16th century renaissance master @entity7 ( left ) but the selling price suggests it may have been done by the artist himself mr @entity14 explained it was very difficult to judge the painting			1
he said : ' we described it as by a follower of @entity7 because that is what it looked like and i still think that to be the case			1
' it was a very interesting picture and very hard to value			0
' if you asked three people the question ' how much is it worth ? ' you would get three different answers			0
one reputable gallery stopped bidding at £ 10,000 because that was how much they were prepared to pay for it			2
' obviously as least two people thought it was worth the money because the bidding just went up and up			2
' we must have advertised it well because all the right people attended the sale			0
on the day of the sale i thought it might go for a few thousand pounds so we were obviously delighted with the outcome			0
' people play their cards very close to their chest at these things and the person who bought it came in and was only interested in this item and nothing else			0
