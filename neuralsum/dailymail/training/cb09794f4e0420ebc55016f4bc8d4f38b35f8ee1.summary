a @entity1 student who shared a freshman suite with ' @entity3 ' when she was allegedly gang - raped at a fraternity party has defended her former roommate			1
@entity6 spoke out in support of @entity3 in a letter published in the @entity9 on monday , three days after @entity10 acknowledged ' mistakes ' in its reporting of the claims			1
' while i can not say what happened that night , and i can not prove the validity of every tiny aspect of her story to you , i can tell you that this story is not a hoax , a lie or a scheme , ' @entity6 wrote			1
' something terrible happened to @entity3 at the hands of several men who have yet to receive any repercussions			2
the victim 's friend has now spoken out in her defense in the @entity10 article , @entity3 said she had been lured into a room by a member of @entity33 and raped by seven men in 2012 , when she was just starting out as a freshman			1
the explosive article portrayed a culture of sexual violence at @entity1 , one of the nation 's leading public universities , and rocked the campus			2
the fraternity , which was suspended after the story was published , has denied the assault and in a statement on friday , it said it did n't host an event on the night @entity3 alleged she was raped			1
after the statement , @entity10 released an apology that some took to blame @entity3			1
' our trust in her was misplaced , ' it said			0
the magazine then quietly modified the apology to say : ' these mistakes are on @entity10 , not on @entity3			1
we apologize to anyone who was affected by the story and we will continue to investigate the events of that evening			0
' accusation : a student identified only as @entity3 , pictured , said she was raped by seven men in 2012 in her letter on monday , @entity6 said she has no doubt something happened to @entity3 , who was ' bright , happy and bubbly ' when she started at the college			1
' that all notably changed by december 2012 , ' she wrote			2
she - and others girls - noticed @entity3 was becoming ' withdrawn and depressed ' , was skipping class and watching hours of tv instead			2
then that december , she broke down			0
' all of a sudden she was going home and none of us knew why , ' she wrote			0
' it was right before finals , and i could n't believe she was leaving			0
she was distraught , and only said she needed to go home			0
her teachers had given her allowance to take her finals over break			0
' at that point , we knew something big had happened			0
i did n't know until this year with the publication of @entity10 's article how bad that time was for her			2
' she said that later that year , @entity3 did tell her that she had been attacked by several men at a party but that she did not give any more details on the incident			1
' i fully support @entity3 , and i believe wholeheartedly that she went through a traumatizing sexual assault , ' she wrote			1
despite @entity10 's apology , @entity3 has said she stands by her story			1
amended : @entity10 's first apology apparently put blame on @entity3 for mistakes in the article , but a second apology ( pictured ) now says ' these mistakes are on @entity10 , not on @entity3 ' protests : a member of the audience holds a sign during a board of visitors meeting about sexual assault at the @entity1 last week in @entity119 following the damning article 's publication the magazine said it should n't have agreed to her request not to contact the alleged assailants to get their side of the story , out of sensitivity to her			1
the magazine 's managing editor , @entity129 , has said that @entity3 is now unsure if the man who allegedly lured her into the room to be raped by the seven men was a member of @entity33			2
after the apology , some advocates for rape victims expressed concern that the magazine 's backpedaling could undermine efforts to combat campus sexual assaults			0
the @entity142 said that should not be allowed to happen			0
' sexual assault is a problem across college campuses , and we remain committed to being leaders in the campaign for long - term change , ' the council said in a statement			1

the @entity171 , the @entity172 and the @entity173 said @entity1			0
should apologize for a ' rush to judgment '			0
' we believe universities must demonstrate more respect for the fundamental rights to due process and freedom of association for students and student organizations when allegations of misconduct are lodged , ' they said in the statement			0
' a rush to judgment on campus all too often turns out to be wrong , especially when applied at the organizational level			0
