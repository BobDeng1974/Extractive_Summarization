dark history : @entity1 accused two young men of rape in 1998 , just months before she was recruited to join billionaire @entity5 's underage harem			1
pictured above in january 2015 in @entity6 the woman who claims she was forced to have sex with prince @entity9 during her time as a ' sex slave ' for billionaire @entity5 is now having her credibility questioned following a new report that reveals she previously accused two young men of rape			1
@entity1 , 31 , is currently in the midst of a lawsuit claiming she was recruited to join @entity5 's harem of underage women in 1999 , naming prince @entity9 and attorney @entity18 as two of the men she was made to ' service '			1
both men strongly deny the claims			0
it has now been revealed that just months before she was introduced to convicted - pedophile @entity5 , then 14 - year - old @entity1 accused two acquaintances of rape			1
the @entity27 uncovered court records which show prosecutors decided not to press formal charges due to @entity1 ' ' lack of credibility ' as a victim			1
according to the records , police started investigating the case on the insistence of @entity1 ' mother and after a report made by a social worker at a group home			1
while officers at first had a hard time getting in contact with @entity1 because she was living at a medical facility , she eventually told them her side of the story			2
she reported that in early february 1998 , she had been drinking alcohol and smoking pot in a wooded area near @entity52 with friends @entity54 , 18 , and @entity55 , 17 , when she passed out			2
( their full names were not reported since they were not formally charged with a crime			0
) she says she later woke up to both of the young men taking turns raping her - an ordeal she says went on for about five to seven hours			0
royal connection : @entity1 went on to work as a ' sex slave ' for @entity5 for three years , during which she was forced to have sex with prince @entity9 ( pictured together above ) @entity1 recalled being dropped off at @entity54 's house later where he had sex with her again			1
when officers tracked down the two men later the following summer , both testified that it was a consensual threesome			0
a detective who spoke with @entity54 reported that the young man said the girl was tired and that he urged her to do to sleep			0
he says she then ' said to him something to the effect of " why do n't you keep me awake			0
" ' so he thought it was consensual when they had sex following that statement			0
accusations : the 1998 rape case never went to trial because prosecutors said @entity1 lacked credibility			1
she went on to serve as a sex slave for @entity5 ( left ) for three years			1
in addition to having sex with prince @entity9 , she says she was forced to service attorney @entity18 ( right ) as well			2
@entity18 and the @entity9 have strongly denied the claims ' at no point did i hear no , i guess that 's the important thing , ' @entity54 said , according to the police report			2
@entity54 surrendered to police in august 1998 and was booked on a charge of lewd assault upon a child			0
he told the @entity27 that he only saw @entity1 once again after that night and that he was completely surprised by the accusation			2
@entity55 was processed as a juvenile			0
however , prosecutors decided to drop the case in october 1998 due to @entity1 ' ' lack of credibility and no substantial likelihood of success at trial			1
' @entity110 , the defense lawyer who represented @entity55 in the rape allegations , says the fact that prosecutors did n't believe @entity1 would be a believable victim could hamper her current lawsuit			1
' she needs to be careful the past does nâ€™t come back to haunt her , ' he told the @entity27			0
but one of @entity1 ' current lawyers says the previous case proves nothing			2
' for the prosecutors to describe her as not credible means only that they did not think they had sufficient evidence to win			0
but she was raped , ' attorney @entity123 said in a statement			0
' and to be victimized all over again with the leak of sealed juvenile records is disgraceful			0
' all alone : @entity5 is alleged to have taken his harem and wealthy businessmen to vacations on his private island in the @entity132 ( pictured above ) according to court records connected with @entity1 ' current lawsuit , she maintains that she was recruited to join @entity5 's harem in 1999 by his friend , the socialite @entity136			2
she says during the three years she worked for @entity5 , she was made to entertain his friends and named prince @entity9 and @entity18 as two men she had sex with			1
both men have denied having sex with @entity1 , and @entity18 is trying to get his name removed from the suit , claiming @entity1 made the entire story up			1
@entity5 , 61 , has already served 13 months behind bars after admitting to soliciting sex from the underage girls			0

@entity1 was 14 years old in 1998 when she claimed she was raped by two male acquaintances
prosecutors never brought the case to trial based on @entity1 ' ' lack of credibility '
the now 31 - year - old woman is currently in the middle of a lawsuit , claiming she was used as a sex slave by @entity9 and others
