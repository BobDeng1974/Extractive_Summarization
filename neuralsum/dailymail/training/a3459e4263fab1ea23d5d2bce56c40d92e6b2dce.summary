former @entity20 star @entity0 has held tryouts in @entity4 for a basketball team to play a match against former @entity1 athletes to mark dictator @entity14 's birthday @entity0 spent his first day in the secretive state watching a few dozen local players show off their skills speaking after the tryouts , @entity0 said : ' you know , they 're still afraid to come here , but i 'm just telling them , you know , do n't be afraid man , it 's all love , it 's all love here			1
' i understand what 's going on with the political stuff , and i say , i do n't go into that venture , i 'm just doing one thing for these kids here , and for this country , and for my country , and for the world pretty much			2
' wearing a pink button - down shirt and puffing on a cigar , @entity0 asked one player , @entity45 , why he liked basketball			1
@entity45 said it was because he had seen it on tv and knew it was a favourite of @entity14 and his father @entity51			2
when @entity0 asked the other players if they felt the same , they all nodded with enthusiasm			2
while @entity0 is close to picking his starting 12 for the match , he admits he 's struggling to convince the @entity12 to come as they fear for their safety wearing a pink shirt and puffing on a cigar @entity0 explained to the players that if they get picked they will each be given two new pairs of shoes in the spirit of unity the january 8 match will be played with @entity65 for one half , but with mixed teams for the second half ' i want you guys to do one thing for your leader , ' @entity0 then told them			1
' it 's his birthday			2
it 's a very special , special day for the country			1
' it is less than a week since @entity14 's powerful uncle was dragged from office and executed , but @entity0 has refused to comment on the issue , or on the detention of @entity12 @entity82 for allegedly committing anti-state crimes			1
instead his focus has been on sport and the basketball game which he hopes will be without political or nationalistic undertones			2
in aid of that goal , @entity4 will play against @entity12 in the first half , but for the second half the teams will be mixed			0
@entity0 has said he will not ask his ' good friend ' @entity14 about the execution of his uncle just over a week ago when @entity0 asked the players why they liked the sport they all agreed it was because it was favoured by their leader and his father , @entity51 @entity0 added : ' it 's not about win or loss			1
it 's about one thing - unite two countries			0
' if all goes well @entity0 says he will be planning another game in july			2
@entity0 , 52 , a former @entity20 player , has been fiercely criticised by both @entity12 and @entity4 for his relationship with @entity14 who has imprisoned and murdered thousands of his own impoverished citizens			1
the bizarre friendship between the two which began while @entity0 was filming an @entity112 series about the @entity113 in february			0
@entity0 was born on may 13 , 1961 , in @entity114 , @entity115			0
his father left home while he was young , and according to his website his mother disowned him after he was accused of stealing watches while working as a janitor at @entity122			0
however in his late teens @entity0 found success as a basketball player and quickly established himself as one of the @entity1 's most unique talents			1
he famously spent a period of his life cross-dressing , appearing at various celebrity events dressed in women 's clothing , and decided to hold several interviews from inside gay bars			0
he had high - profile relationships with @entity136 and actress @entity137 , before deciding to settle down @entity0 - style by marrying himself while wearing a white silk dress			0
he also became very well known for his numerous tattoos , facial piercings and multicolored hair			0
however following retirement @entity0 had a series of high - profile court appearances with his ex-wife @entity145 over refusal to pay several hundred thousand dollars of child support			0
he was also sentenced to 104 hours of community service in may 2012			0
since then he has become an unlikely quasi-political figure , appearing at the @entity150 after the retirement of @entity152 to try and elect the world 's first black @entity153 , before striking up a weird and much - criticised friendship with @entity4 dictator @entity14			1
@entity157 met the communist leader in february this year while filming an @entity112 show about the @entity113 and has since visited the secretive state several times			0
despite his insistence that he will not involve himself in diplomacy , he referred to @entity163 and @entity164 as ' a * * holes ' after one visit in which he failed to convince his ' good friend ' @entity14 to ' do me a solid ' and release @entity12 prisoner @entity82 .			0
