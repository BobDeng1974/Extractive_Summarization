by @entity0 anyone who has ventured into the blocky virtual world of @entity3 quickly realises the size of the massively popular online game			1
but for one user , finding out exactly how big it is has become an obsession			0
@entity9 hopes to reach the edge of the game , a murky area only referred to by the game 's creator as ' the @entity15 ' - even though he expects it to take 25 years			1
available on everything from smartphones to games consoles , @entity3 is a virtual world made up of square blocks of various materials			2
players can break down and build structures through farming and mining			2
each game generates a brand new world populated with a unique configuration of trees , plains and mountains , making it ideal for exploring			2
the world continues to automatically generate as the player moves further away from its centre - although its creators have warned of the @entity47 , where the game 's code may begin to break down			1
@entity50 began his quest three years ago , in march 2011			2
he loaded up a new game , chose a direction and started walking - and has covered over 700km since			1
his aim if to get to and area of the game @entity3 creator @entity57 has called the ' @entity47 , ' so far from the center of the world that the game can no longer support the size of the world recently , he turned the quest into a walk - a - thon for @entity65 , and has so far raised over $ 160,000			1
' i began my @entity68 series as a standard @entity69 , where i built a settlement , searched for resources and explored the area around my spawn point , ' he said			0
' after a while i grew impatient and in the 11th episode of the series decided to pack some essential supplies and head west with the goal of reaching these mysterious @entity47			0
another shot of the journey so far , revealing snowy peaks			0
a map of the journey so far , showing each rest stop as a block - so far over 700km has been covered ' i vowed to make my attempt for the @entity47 without the aid of any mods or cheats , and i have also decided to utilize the popularity of my expedition and turn it into a fundraiser for the @entity65 charity ! ' one of the biggest snags to hit the virtual expedition was when @entity98 creators removed the @entity47 ' unfortunately , the @entity100 were removed from the game when the new terrain generation code was released in an update on september 12th , 2011 , ' he admitted			1
however , he vowed not to upgrade			0
' fear not , fellow @entity104 ! i will continue the expedition in @entity106 for as long as i must ! ' so far the @entity3 world has remained stable - but there are fears it could develop bugs as the game 's limits approach			1
on his journey , @entity50 is armed with a sword and a pickaxe , and is accompanied by his trusted companion @entity118 , a tamed wolf he found in the game			1
he narrates each episode of his series			0
the series transformed into a sort of podcast , where the topics i talk about might have little to do with the journey itself , ' he told the @entity131			0
' of course , it is always exciting when @entity3 re-grabs my attention with a perilous cliff , a zombie attack , or a memorable landscape , and i remember the journey i â€™m on			0

@entity9 has already travelled 700 virtual km in the game
estimates it will take him *22* years to complete his journey
hopes to reach the ' far worlds ' - an area where the game begins to break down
