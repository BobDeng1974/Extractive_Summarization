sir @entity0 likened it to the ‘ initial jabs of a boxing match ’ ; a moment when the main contenders in this year ’s @entity5 flexed their muscles for the first time			1
that moment arrived on the steepest gradient the riders will encounter during this entire three - week race			1
it came on the 33 per cent incline of @entity14 in @entity15 ; a residential street which has handrails for pedestrians who struggle with the severe gradient and which must have burned out more than a few clutches			2
rising out of the saddle and dancing on the pedals in that distinctive rocking style , the @entity49 glanced over one shoulder and then the other as if to say to @entity25 ‘ where are you ? how you finding the pace ? ’ @entity25 ’s response was to deliver one of those trademark bursts he uses to greatest effect on the slopes of the @entity63 and the @entity64			1
a sudden acceleration that propels him off the front of the peloton and crushes those left in his wake			2
only @entity25 was not trying to put any time on his rivals , or win this stage			1
not least because it is far too soon to be defending the yellow jersey			2
no , he simply wanted to show his rivals , much as he did on a similar ramp on the second stage in @entity76 last year , that he could open up a gap on them at will			1
he pulled a few metres clear and then eased off the gas as he passed over the summit , enabling the leading contenders to regroup			2
on their way : riders make their way past @entity86 at the start of the second stage of the @entity5 one for the album : fans take photos as the peloton passes @entity86 @entity32 — perhaps third favourite this year having won the @entity93 in 2013 — then attacked on the run in to @entity15 to snatch the stage and take yellow with a two - second lead			1
in truth , most of the field could have taken yellow off @entity102 , the @entity104 finishing the punishing 201km stage from @entity105 almost 20 minutes down			1
‘ i think what we saw was more psychological than anything at this stage of the game , ’ said @entity106 principal @entity0 of that @entity14 ascent			1
‘ it ’s only stage two so it ’s like the initial jabs of a boxing match			2
@entity25 was n’t having a go			1
it was n’t an attack			2
the fact that @entity32 is in yellow works for us			2
they have to defend it now			2
‘ @entity32 is a bike racer			0
that ’s why people like his style			0
he saw his opportunity and he seized it			0
it was great to see			0
we ’re not unhappy about it because it ’s only two seconds			0
’ no time for tea : the riders pass @entity139 tea rooms in @entity141 's square as they speed through @entity86 climb : the peloton ride up @entity143 in @entity144 as spectators strain for a goof view cobble challenge : the riders make their way up @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity150 favourite : @entity46 's @entity25 gets ready to race as thousands of fans watch on at @entity105 @entity25 declined the opportunity to discuss his performance in the context of his rivals			1
he did make the valid point that going over the summit of @entity14 first gave him a clear view of the tricky descent that followed			0
but @entity160 led @entity25 into the final climbs of the day , shielding his team leader against a stiff wind when required , and could see what was happening come that last , nasty rise			1
‘ it was great racing and on @entity14 all the gc ( general category ) guys tested each other out , ’ he said			0
‘ everyone wanted to be at the front and when one person eased up another one had a go			0
it was just having little digs			0
’ once again they raced against the backdrop of some stunning @entity150 scenery , benefiting from back - to - back sunny days			0
out of action : @entity183 has been forced to withdraw from @entity5 with a shoulder of injury the leader : @entity104 's @entity102 , wearing the yellow jersey , talks to compatriot @entity188 anticipation : spectators packed deep on each side on @entity192 in @entity86 await the start of the race making a dash : a breakaway group climb @entity197 , the longest continuous gradient in @entity199 at 5.5 miles away they go : the riders and support vehicles continue the slow climb of @entity197 with nine category climbs to test the best and make sprinters like @entity207 suffer , the stage drew yet more astonishing numbers			1
the organisers claimed some two million spectators lined @entity150 ’s roads on saturday and by sunday night @entity212 , the race director , was estimating that five million had turned out over the entire weekend			1
‘ it was a tough stage today , ’ said @entity25			1
‘ undulating all day with a big fight for position			0
but the crowds out there were incredible			0
' the support we ’ve had from @entity150 has really been out of this world			0
at times today i had goosebumps all over me			0
’ after leaving @entity86 a seven - man breakaway was formed with @entity224 acquiring enough points over the climbs to secure the @entity227 come the end of the day			0
they rolled past a cornfield that had been transformed into a huge advertising hoarding for @entity233 ’s chief sponsors , and struggled over the @entity234 before rolling up @entity197 — a gentle climb but the longest continuous ascent in the country at 5km			2
in all , there was 3,000m of climbing on sunday but no ascent looked prettier than the cobbles of @entity144 village ; once the home of the @entity245 sisters			0
a crowd of 60,000 turned @entity247 into something resembling an open air rock concert			0
‘ @entity247 was incredible , ’ said @entity160			0
lead out : @entity251 's @entity250 ( left ) wearing the best young 's white jersey , @entity104 's @entity102 ( second left ) wearing the overall leader 's yellow jersey , @entity256 's @entity255 ( second right ) wearing the best sprinter 's green jersey , and @entity104 's @entity188 ( right ) wearing the best climber 's polka dot jersey , ride out of @entity105 tightly bunched : the peloton ride down @entity262 in @entity86 during the ceremonial opening to the second stage what a view ! the @entity5 general director @entity212 ( right ) and welcome to @entity150 chief executive @entity267 hitch a lift ahead of the riders flying the flag : crowds gather at @entity272 in @entity86 in anticipation of the riders coming past @entity274 : spectators line the balconies at @entity105 ahead of the start capture the moment : fans attempt to get a good shot of the riders as they pass by @entity282 played : this woman came prepared for the long wait for the riders to reach @entity247 in the @entity285 record breaker : @entity287 , the co-founder of the @entity289 brewing company puts the finishing touches to his attempt at the record for the world 's largest glass of beer			1
the glass holds 3,664 pints of @entity298 's gold ale , one pint for every kilometer of the @entity5 spicy : a group of fans dressed in @entity303 garb wait for the arrival of the cyclists spotty : some people in @entity307 were truly in the spirit of the occasion , painting polka dots on their house stunning : a view over @entity247 as spectators await the arrival of the riders party time : spectators in fancy dress form a conga line in the @entity321 village of @entity322 man in the mask : a fan with a @entity183 mask is given a lift while three cheering @entity328 look on @entity329 , otherwise known as home to the beloved characters from @entity332 , looked pretty damn splendid , too			1
it was close to there that @entity335 was involved in a relatively minor crash but @entity25 ’s chief lieutenant did well to recover from the two minutes he lost waiting for a new bike			1
in the end he finished safely two places behind @entity25			1
‘ with around 35km to go it was really steep , up and down and the @entity343 team put the hammer down so there were only 20 guys left , ’ said @entity160			0
‘ but @entity25 and @entity335 came through in good shape and that was all that mattered			1
‘ it was more about staying out of trouble , ’ he said , before joining his colleagues on the team bus for the journey to @entity353 for monday ’s stage into @entity355			1
‘ all the main contenders were putting in a few moves			0
it was really just a case of making sure we did n’t lose any time			0
’ and letting the main contenders know he can hurt them whenever the mood takes him .			2
