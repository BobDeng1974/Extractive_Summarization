an artist who was diagnosed with @entity2 's disease and left unable to eat many of his favourite foods has turned her cravings into striking artworks			1
@entity8 's clever designs include a berry pie beret , a tasty - looking fish pie fascinator and even a salad sombrero			1
the 36 - year - old @entity13 artist carefully recreated each ingredient using felt , plastic and wire before fixing it all to hats the 36 - year - old costume designer began creating the designs of foods his @entity2 's prevented him from eating @entity8 's designs are certainly original but it is their incredibly realistic appearance that makes them stand out ' when i discovered i had @entity2 's disease i was forced to start a special diet and was unable to eat many of the foods i have always loved , ' said the artist , who also works as a costume designer			1
' so instead of eating them , i created them out of felt and fibres and made them into beautiful fascinators			2
' now cured of his illness , he added : ' i am able to eat what i like now but i still love making new additions to my @entity43 collection			0
' mr @entity8 , who is a teacher at @entity45 's @entity44 in @entity13 , has been making the hats and fascinators for two years			1
his inspiration is derived mainly from his work as a theatre set designer , using the different costumes from throughout history			0
@entity53 pictured in his studio adding the final touches to one of his pieces one particularly striking specimen is this inverted ice cream cone creation talk about something looking fishy ! this design would certainly catch people 's attention @entity8 uses just simple materials such as felt and wires to create his unique designs he hopes that women who wear his hats feel ' glamorous but still unique , creative and sometimes even humorous ' each of the hats is made differently , requiring different timescales depending on their intricacy each of the hats is made differently , requiring different timescales depending on their intricacy			1
' i have never seen hats like mine , ' added mr @entity8			2
' i do believe my work is unique and i hope people see that			0
i have a hunger and an urge to create beautiful headpieces for women to wear that will make them feel glamorous but still unique , creative and sometimes even humorous			0
' my hats are designed with a wink in the eye and a tongue in the cheek and i think that is what my customers really respond to			0
' people buy hats from me because they want something that stands out from the crowd and i am more than happy to oblige			0
' the level of detail in some of the designs , such as this outdoor picnic , is amazing his inspiration is derived mainly from his work as a theatre set designer , using the different costumes from throughout history @entity53 , who is a teacher at @entity45 's @entity44 in @entity13 , has been making the fascinators for over two years now each intricate design is filled with details , such as the spilled wine glass at the dinner table ( left ) and the visiting rabbit at the picnic ( right )			2

idea came about when @entity8 was diagnosed with @entity2 's disease
unable to eat favourite foods , so *remade* them as hats instead
incredibly realistic looking foods are made out of felt , plastic and wire
designs include a berry pie beret , fishy fascinator and a salad sombrero
