reports of genital theft are a relatively common occurrence across @entity4 and @entity5 , scholars say			1
academics observing reports of penis snatching on the continent have previously deemed it an urban phenomenon - a manifestation of the anxieties that arise when a village becomes a city and rural people find themselves living among crowds of unfamiliar people			1
so a @entity20 anthropologist was ' intrigued ' when she arrived in the tiny hamlet of @entity22 in the @entity23 , to find two villagers claiming to have been the victims of genital theft			1
remote : the @entity20 academic found two men who claimed to have been victims of genital theft in @entity22 , in the @entity23 previous instances have been reported in crowded centres like @entity32 , @entity33 , or @entity34 , in @entity35			1
@entity36 , a postdoctoral fellow in geography at the @entity38 , said villagers in @entity22 told her of a traveller , upon arriving on a @entity42 merchant truck , removed two men 's penises with a handshake			2
the academic was told the stranger had targeted a tea seller in the market and a second man , she wrote in a report on alternet.org			2
' after handing over his money , he [ the stranger ] clasped the vendor ’s hand			2
the tea seller felt an electric tingling course through his body and immediately sensed that his penis had shrunk to a size smaller than that of a baby ’s			2
his yells quickly drew a crowd			0
' somehow in the fray a second man fell victim as well , ' she wrote			0
several eyewitnesses assured her the ' appendages did indeed shrink dramatically '			0
urban phenomenon : previous reports of penis - snatching have occurred in heavily populated parts of @entity5 like @entity32 , @entity33 ( pictured ) ms @entity36 described victims ' on both sides ' of the phenomenon , which she wrote was linked to a ' general resurgence of witchcraft ' in @entity5			1
having visited one of the so - called ' victims ' and finding that he ' clearly seemed to be suffering ' as he lay listless in the shade at his home , the academic was later told that the alleged penis - snatcher had been executed by gunshot by members of the armed rebel group that governs @entity22			1
the rebels ' version of events was that the thief had ' mysteriously vanished from his holding cell ' , she wrote			0
ms @entity36 said she was told the stolen organs were sold to occult healers			0
having asked the town doctor what could be done to help the victims , she was told : ' western medicine is no match for this magic			0
it is a mysterious thing			0
