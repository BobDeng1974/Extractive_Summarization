a @entity1 school district has fired an attorney who successfully defended it during a case claiming a 14 - year - old girl was mature enough to consent to a romance with her 28 - year - old teacher			1
in civil court proceedings , the @entity8 argued that the unnamed student should bear some responsibility for her relationship with @entity13			1
the district 's general counsel said friday it is removing attorney @entity17 from future legal matters because of inappropriate remarks he made about the case			1
lawyers and advocates for sexual abuse victims criticized @entity17 's strategy of blaming the schgoolgirl for agreeing to the sexual relationship			2
in july 2011 , @entity13 , who taught at @entity26 , was sentenced to three years in state prison after being convicted of lewd acts against a child			1
he has since been freed			0
however the school was cleared of any wrongdoing			0
speaking of the victim 's ' responsibility ' for the relationship , @entity17 , @entity8 's attorney , told the public radio station @entity36 : ' she lied to her mother so she could have sex with her teacher			1
attorney w. @entity17 ( right ) was fired because of remarks he made during the case ' she went to a motel in which she engaged in voluntary consensual sex with her teacher			2
why should n't she be responsible for that ? ' recently , the girl filed a civil lawsuit against the school district , claiming the system was negligent and she had been emotionally traumatized by @entity13 's actions			1
in its defense , @entity8 argued it had been unaware of the relationship between the student and her teacher , but cited a federal court decision saying a minor could consent to sex in some situations			2
during the trial , mr @entity17 also introduced the girl 's sexual history and argued that she bore some of the responsibility for the half - year - long relationship , according to @entity69			1
at the end of the case , the judge ruled in favor of the district : @entity8 was cleared of wrongdoing by a civil jury , while the girl was not awarded any damages for the trauma she allegedly suffered			1
although the girl 's lawyer is now appealing the case , the verdict has raised concerns about a conflict between @entity1 criminal and civil law when it comes to sexual consent			1
middle school : in july 2011 , @entity13 , who taught at @entity90 ( pictured ) was sentenced to three years in state prison after being convicted of lewd acts against a child			1
he has since been freed ' it does n't make sense , ' said @entity96 , an @entity97 law professor who has studied consent laws nationwide , including @entity1 's age of consent ( 18 ) in criminal cases			0
' the same parties , same behavior , same everything , consent is no defense in a criminal trial			0
but the same set of facts in a civil prosecution , consent is a complete defense			0
how is that possible ? it 's not logical			0
' meanwhile , lawyers and advocates for sexual abuse victims have described @entity8 's legal tactics as appalling			2
' the belief that middle school children can consent to sexual activity is something one would expect to hear from pedophile advocates , not the second - largest school district in the @entity125 , ' attorney @entity118 told the @entity126			0
the girl 's attorney , @entity127 , also said he was shocked by the judge 's verdict			2
' i have never seen a verdict form where the child has been listed as partially responsible for his or her own molestation , ' said mr @entity127			0
in defending his tactics , mr @entity17 further came under fire for saying that it takes maturity to decide to cross the street and that is more dangerous than deciding to have sex with a teacher			0
since speaking to @entity36 , mr @entity17 has apologized for his ' insensitive ' comments			0
' my statements were ill thought out and poorly articulated and by no means reflect the opinions of the school district or its leadership , ' the attorney said in a written apology on thursday			0
the district said it would continue using mr @entity17 's firm .			2
