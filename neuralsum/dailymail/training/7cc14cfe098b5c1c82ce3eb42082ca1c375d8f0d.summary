by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 19 may 2013 a bag of frozen peas is an age - old remedy for sore joints and bruises			1
now , an innovative medical product called frozenpeaz – sealed packs containing tiny balls of solidified corn syrup , dyed pea - green – looks just like the vegetables and offers the same benefits , without wasting food			1
traditional ice packs – usually plastic bags containing silicone gel – and cold compresses reduce swelling by constricting blood vessels and can numb pain			2
they are widely used to treat injuries and tackle acute and chronic pain			0
new remedy : researchers have created a new medical product called @entity28 , pictured , which can be repeatedly frozen and re-used to sooth aches and pains but the @entity31 recommends a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel as a good ice pack for joint pain , sprains , strains and bruises			1
they are useful and convenient because ice packs often need to thaw , lessening the chilling effect , while peas conform to the shape of the knee or other joint			1
but once they are thawed , they form into clumps when refrozen			0
the new product replicates the benefits of placing a bag of frozen peas on a strain or ache now researchers have developed a perfect ‘ bag of peas ’ that can be refrozen without losing its shape			1
@entity28 conform to the shape of the joint no matter how many times they are frozen			1
the corn syrup ‘ peas ’ – the same size and colour as the edible type – come in bags that can be put into wraps shaped for knees , shoulders and faces			1
they cost £ 20 to £ 50			0
frozenpeaz need to be in a freezer for four hours to freeze completely , but will provide some relief after two hours			0
twenty minutes is the recommended maximum time for a session of cold therapy			0
the same device can be used to provide heat therapy , also effective in treating chronic joint pain			0
instead of putting the ‘ peas ’ in a freezer , pop them into a microwave			2
they can help relax sore muscles or increase the range of motion in a painful joint			0
‘ ice packs and hot and cold treatments are a proven way of easing the pain of arthritis in the short term , and some might find this product useful , ’ says @entity90 of @entity91			2
‘ but they are much more expensive than a pack of peas			0

new sealed packs of @entity28 contain tiny balls of solidified corn syrup
they replicate the benefits of a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel
but @entity28 can be used again and again without wasting food
