the dreaded polar vortex will rear its frigid head this year despite previous predictions to the contrary , an expert @entity6 forecaster said thursday , just as @entity8 officials warned @entity9 to brace for the first snow of the season			1
@entity6 meteorologist @entity12 revealed his predictions on @entity14 , where he writes ' the polar vortex is already dropping farther south than normal			1
' his report goes head to head with one out of the @entity18 just last month , which suggested this year 's cold months simply wo n't be as historically bone - chilling as last winter			1
the folks at @entity43 included a photo , presumably from last year , as an unsettling reminder as of thursday , with @entity48 temps poised to dip to record lows for november and snow already threatening the @entity51 , it appeared @entity12 's was the forecast to follow			1
@entity53 predicts an 80 percent chance of snow and ice would clog travel up @entity58 from northern @entity59 into southern @entity60 starting thursday and stretching into friday			1
@entity43 issue a ' snow alert ' for 8pm thursday			2
' @entity64 spreaders are loaded and ready to be deployed , ' they tweeted			0
' @entity8 can expect about a half - inch of the white stuff to pile up thursday			1
meanwhile , a massive arctic bubble ahead of a polar vortex was set to force temperatures down to around 10f below normal for this time of years just about everywhere except the @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 @entity36			2
' it looks like we are heading for a much colder than normal start to the winter , ' @entity12 writes			2
pointing toward a ' long expected ' @entity73 this winter , @entity18 forecaster @entity74 just last month wrote : ' a repeat of last winter is not particularly likely			1
' we can hope @entity18 has the more accurate predictions , but until then , expect a bracingly cold weekend in much of the @entity22 the @entity80 chill is gripping the @entity81 and @entity48 - and it 's crawling east			1
a new study says that as the world gets warmer , parts of @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 could see more frequent and stronger visits of that cold air			0
researchers say that 's because of shrinking ice in the seas off @entity94			2
normally , the polar vortex is penned in the @entity80			0
but at times it escapes and wanders south , bringing with it a bit of @entity80 super chill			0
that can happen for several reasons , and the new study suggests that one of them occurs when ice in northern seas shrinks , leaving more water uncovered			0
normally , sea ice keeps heat energy from escaping the ocean and entering the atmosphere			0
when there 's less ice , more energy gets into the atmosphere and weakens the jet stream , the high - altitude river of air that usually keeps @entity80 air from wandering south , said study co-author @entity118 of the @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity121			1
so the cold air escapes instead			0
that happened relatively infrequently in the 1990s , but since 2000 it has happened nearly every year , according to a study published tuesday in the journal a visual representation of the dreaded polar vortex			2
is it coming and do we have melting sea ice to blame ? @entity133 drops in temperature are expected in other parts of the @entity22 in the coming days , thanks to a powerful weather system that hit @entity138 with hurricane - force winds over the weekend before blanketing several state ins snow			1
dangerously cold weather was expected to linger until thursday in eastern @entity142 , where temperatures could reach as low as negative 30 degrees			1
@entity145 's high was only was 5 degrees on wednesday , a day after the snow - covered city broke a nearly century - old record for the lowest temperature ever recorded on a nov. 11			1
the frigid air was expected to crawl into the @entity152 , mid-south and the @entity51 by thursday			2
forecasters have issued freeze and cold - weather warnings across parts of @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
in @entity163 , @entity142 , where temperatures fell from the high 60s into the single digits on tuesday , @entity162 said she was warned about the weather before arriving from @entity167 to celebrate her 70th birthday with family			2
' yesterday i was wearing sandals and a short - sleeve shirt , and today i 'm wearing a coat and scarf and turtleneck and sweatshirt and gloves , ' she said			0
@entity178 and ice : @entity53 predicts an 80 percent chance of snow and ice would clog travel up @entity58 from northern @entity59 into southern @entity60 starting thursday and stretching into friday			1
get ready , @entity8 : the @entity80 chill is gripping the @entity81 and @entity48 - and it 's crawling east			1
@entity133 drops in temperature are expected in other parts of the @entity22 in the coming days , thanks to a powerful weather system that hit @entity138 with hurricane - force winds over the weekend before blanketing several state in snow temperatures fell more than 30 degrees overnight in northern @entity193 , from a high of 58 on tuesday to 26 degrees on wednesday			1
similar swings hit @entity196 , where temperatures went from 80 degrees monday to a low of 30 on tuesday			0
in the @entity199 , wind chills made it feel like 20 below in some places			0
but that was good news for @entity204 of @entity205 , @entity206 , a heating and ventilation business that was doing booming trade			0
' bang ! we get this arctic blast , and it just opens the floodgates , ' said @entity213 , a department head			0
' we 're behind right now as we 're sitting here talking			0
' parts of @entity6 's @entity216 were buried in more than 3 feet of snow on wednesday , with more snow forecast through the weekend , along with temperatures that dipped in the 20s and 30s			1
up to 18 inches fell in northern @entity221 , while parts of central @entity223 saw more than 16 inches of snow			0
many roads were snow - covered and slippery wednesday in the @entity216 , where residents are accustomed to snowy conditions			0
of his drive into work , @entity229 meteorologist @entity228 said that roads were ' just rutted out and kind of felt like you were driving over a washboard			0
' even chillier : tonight will get even worse			0
as the sun sets , snow was expected to push east and dust the @entity51 from northern @entity59 up through southern @entity60 friday night will chill much of the @entity22 below typical temperatures as well			2
only the @entity35 and @entity36 @entity36 can expect to be spared			0

a @entity6 weather expert predicts the dreaded arctic *phenomenon* could be a common sight in the @entity22 this winter
the @entity23 @entity22 will experienced temps @entity244 below average in the coming days
the prediction comes despite previous @entity18 forecasts to the contrary and just as @entity8 is bracing for half - inch snowfall thursday
these would be the first *flurries* of the season in winter weary and it 's only november
