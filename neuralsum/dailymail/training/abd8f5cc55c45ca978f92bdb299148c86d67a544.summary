a ' fatberg ' the length of a @entity2 was discovered underneath the streets of west @entity4 - and workers were forced to spend four days tackling the vile mass. the congealed lump - formed from fat , wet wipes and other litter wrongly put down drains and toilets - was detected under a 260ft stretch of a road in @entity15 ’s @entity14			1
a team of sewer experts from @entity18 spent most of last week breaking it down			0
@entity32 , @entity18 sewer operations manager , said : ' we have 108,000km ( 67,108 miles ) of sewers , and that ’s a lot of pipe to keep clear			0
we spend £ 12million a year tackling blockages , most of them formed because people have tipped cooking fats down the drain and wet wipes down the loo			1
' the sewers serve an important purpose - they are not an abyss for household rubbish			0
fat goes down the drain easily enough , but when it hits the cold sewers , it hardens into disgusting fatbergs that block pipes			2
' the immense , solid blockage was removed using high - powered water jets and taken from the sewer to prevent flooding to nearby homes and business people pouring cooking fat away and flushing wet wipes has sparked an increase in the number of ' fatbergs ' he added : ' wet wipes cling to the fat			1
fat clings to the wipes			1
and pretty soon your fatberg is out of control and sewage is backing up into roads , gardens and in the worst cases flooding up through toilets and into homes			1
' we ’ve found all sorts in this sewer – from tennis balls to planks of wood			2
it goes without saying they should n’t be in those pipes			0
@entity4 – bin it , do n’t block it			2
' despite the scale of the fatberg , the residents of @entity15 ’s @entity14 will have to go a long way to go to beat the town of @entity91 , who had a 15 - tonne fatberg removed from a sewer last year			0
the blockage was so critical at one point it threatened to blast the covers off manholes in @entity91 with raw sewage .			0

the sickening body was found under a busy road in @entity4
formed from congealed fat , wet wipes and other things wrongly flushed
workers had to remove it to prevent sewage flooding into people *'s* homes
