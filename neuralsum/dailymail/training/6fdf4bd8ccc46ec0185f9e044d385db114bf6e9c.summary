@entity1 's 5 - 3 capitulation at @entity2 in september was , @entity3 confessed on saturday , his darkest day in charge at @entity5			1
‘ it ’s still a mystery , ’ wrote the @entity1 boss in his programme notes ahead of the rematch with the @entity11 ’s bottom club			2
if he was looking for answers , @entity12 got them all before half time here			0
indeed , @entity12 ’s only criticism on saturday was that they ‘ killed the game too much ’			0
‘ we lost the away match and we have taken revenge , ’ he said			0
‘ we have dominated , especially in the first half			0
‘ in the second half , i want to kill the game but i have to admit my players did too much to kill the game			0
we have played more balls backwards and wide than forwards			0
you have to play forward without risk			0
‘ but i am very pleased			0
i have seen here a team that is playing more like a team			0
’ @entity12 had demanded goals after seeing @entity1 score a mere five in their last six games and he could have few complaints at the response			2
just as he did at @entity2 in september , @entity26 was the man to set the ball rolling after an awfully dour opening in which he was guilty of spooning one of precious few chances 10 yards into the air			1
the @entity31 striker made no mistake when opportunity knocked again in the 24th minute courtesy of great work by his international teammate @entity122			2
@entity18 , @entity123 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity122 ( left to right ) congratulate @entity44 ( centre ) @entity44 thanks fellow countryman @entity122 , pictured in the background with @entity41 and @entity42 , for laying on an assist @entity1 ’s summer signing from @entity129 picked @entity66 ’s pocket in midfield as he anticipated a pass out of defence and instantly floated a pass over the top of the @entity2 defence			1
@entity44 looked suspiciously offside as he raced to meet it but the first - time finish was outstanding , driving the ball beyond @entity30 with his weaker right foot			2
‘ the first goal was offside but they are honest mistakes , ’ said @entity2 boss @entity141 , perhaps too graciously			1
‘ sometimes they go for you , sometimes they do n’t			0
it ’s unhelpful to have decisions go against you but that ’s how it is			0
‘ but it would be wrong of me spending too much time pointing out one decision in a game against a team who played exceptionally well			0
’ having scored the first , @entity44 set up @entity1 ’s second five minutes later			2
@entity41 gives @entity44 a hug after the @entity31 put @entity3 's side in the lead against the foxes @entity162 captain @entity41 congratulates @entity18 following his first - half goal at @entity5 @entity2 ’s lack of pace was ruthlessly exposed again as he spotted @entity123 ’s overlapping run and played the ball into the @entity169 ’s path as he accelerated away from @entity57			1
@entity171 ’s low shot was saved by @entity30 but @entity18 was ahead of @entity172 and @entity56 to bundle the ball home from close range and claim his fourth goal for @entity1			1
@entity12 said : ‘ i am more happy that @entity18 was scoring because @entity26 has already scored enough goals			1
@entity18 needs that goal more than @entity26			1
it is fantastic that they scored and beautiful goals also			0
’ @entity1 made it 3 - 0 a minute before half - time when @entity42 — making his first league start since early november — forced a corner from the left			1
@entity122 met @entity41 ’s cross with a glancing header and @entity57 could n’t get out of the way fast enough as the ball ricocheted off his head and into the net			2
even the @entity2 fans who sang ‘ we ’re going to win 5 - 3 ’ knew lightning would not strike twice			1
‘ the pure maths of it , ’ said @entity141			2
‘ three down and people can smell a heavy defeat			0
’ however , the second half developed into something of a procession for @entity1 and it was only when they switched off that @entity2 got even a glimpse of goal			1
@entity39 shares a word with goalscorer @entity18 as the home side celebrate in front of their supporters @entity18 looked delighted after adding to his @entity1 tally against the @entity11 strugglers @entity44 and @entity42 congratulate @entity18 after the @entity215 international scored @entity1 's second goal of the match @entity57 scored an own goal shortly before the interval to give @entity1 a 3 - 0 lead @entity1 's first team stars celebrate @entity57 's own goal with @entity222 taking the majority of the praise former @entity1 midfielder @entity61 was unable to stop @entity57 's header from landing in the net @entity227 looks dejected after scoring past team - mate @entity30 in the 44th minute @entity2 defender @entity56 scored a late consolation goal for his side by scoring past @entity230 @entity74 keeps a close eye on @entity222 as the @entity1 utility man attempts to get the ball under control @entity171 shoots at goal while @entity2 right back @entity236 attempts to block the @entity239 international 's shot @entity64 threatened to race clear of @entity39 just after the hour mark as he broke from halfway and then slipped in the box , with referee @entity76 unimpressed by his claims for a penalty			1
then substitute @entity65 was presented with half a chance by @entity38 ’s lackadaisical backpass to @entity230 , and the goalkeeper had to be alert to block @entity65 ’s effort from a tight angle			0
@entity2 did claim a consolation goal in the 80th minute , however , after @entity1 failed to clear			1
blind was unfortunate to be hit in the face by the ball at close quarters and was still clearing his head when @entity60 flicked the ball into the path of @entity67			0
his cross to the back post found @entity56 whose downward header was too powerful for @entity262			2
a 3 - 1 lead over @entity2 could have evoked bad memories for @entity1 , but there were certainly no dramas this time			1
@entity63 is challenged by @entity1 's @entity267 during the @entity11 encounter experienced midfielder @entity60 , pictured with @entity41 , replaced @entity59 at the interval @entity1 summer signing @entity171 holds his legs during his side 's 3 - 1 win against @entity2 @entity2 goalkeeper @entity30 was unable to keep the likes of @entity18 and @entity44 at bay @entity50 looks frustrated after being named on @entity1 's substitutes ' bench @entity41 and his @entity1 team - mates wore black armbands to pay tribute to the @entity282 @entity1 boss @entity12 will have been delighted with his side 's performance against @entity2 @entity141 looks frustrated at seeing his side fall to a 3 - 1 defeat against @entity1 @entity1 fans in the @entity288 pay their respects to the @entity282 during the match			1

@entity162 striker @entity26 opened the scoring at @entity5 with 27th minute opener
@entity18 doubled his side 's lead by scoring his fourth @entity1 goal
@entity2 captain @entity57 scored an own goal just before the interval
@entity56 netted a consolation goal for his side with 10 minutes left on the clock
@entity1 fell to *surprise* 5 - 3 defeat against @entity141 's @entity2 in september
