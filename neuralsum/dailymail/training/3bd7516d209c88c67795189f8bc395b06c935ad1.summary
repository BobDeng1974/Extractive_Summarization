the @entity9 also serves as an alternative to plug - in steam mops , which have become enormously popular for cleaning hard floors in the past two years			1
again , the new device has the advantage that it is more convenient			2
there are no power cables , no water tank to fill or delay while it heats up			2
innovation : the @entity9 also serves as an alternative to plug - in steam mops sir @entity31 said : ‘ good technology should make everyday tasks quicker and easier			1
‘ @entity31 ’s high - speed motor technology has enabled @entity31 engineers to develop a cordless machine capable of vacuuming dirt and wiping away stains simultaneously			1
one machine doing two jobs , in one action			0
’ the company will sell packs of wet wipes , which are wrapped around the base and clamped in place			2
these will be either standard versions or ones specifically for wood floors			0

while this is backed up by a powerful lithium - ion battery , which delivers 15 minutes of fade free performance			2
for stubborn dirt , there is a boost setting for six minutes of high intensity cleaning			0
the machine ’s body is made from @entity129 , which is the same material found in riot shields , while the lightweight reinforced wand is aluminium			0
the @entity74 was slammed into obstacles from a number of different angles 39,154 times to ensure it was robust and durable			0
it was also subjected a tumble test with the machine spending over an hour in a rig simulating the effects of a giant cement mixer			0
@entity31 has become one of the @entity3 ’s few modern day manufacturing success stories , with massive sales around the world			1
while its machines are now made in @entity149 it invests nearly £ 1.5 million a week into research and development , mainly in this country			0
the company employs hundreds of engineers and scientists at its @entity156 in @entity157 and will recruit 250 more this year , including many recent graduates			0
