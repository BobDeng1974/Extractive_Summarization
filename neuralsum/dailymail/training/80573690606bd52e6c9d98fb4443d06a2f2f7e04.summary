@entity0 replied by requesting 18 - year - old @entity8 ’ phone number to give his side of the story			0
@entity8 said the skipper then rang him on monday morning			0
' i could n’t believe i would be talking to my hero , i never thought in a million years he would actually ring			0

' i ca n't believe how much of a legend @entity0 is to call me			0
' @entity5 has risked tarnishing his hero status by criticising the lack of vocal backing during the win against @entity26 on saturday , with some of the club ’s most loyal fans claiming he has overstepped the mark			1
@entity5 said @entity7 was like ‘ an empty stadium , ’ a comment that hit a nerve with those who fear they are being priced out of games and discouraged from properly getting behind the team by the club ’s aggressive no - standing policy			1
‘ @entity5 should n’t have done that , he is out of order , ’ said @entity62 , spokesman for the fanzine cfcuk			2

we ’ve already met twice with the club to talk about finding ways to improve the atmosphere			0
’ @entity4 beat @entity26 in their last home game , but @entity5 said he did n't know the crowd was there @entity4 captain @entity0 ( right ) has personally stepped in to try and help the situation last season , @entity62 was among those who organised a collection to pay @entity5 ’s £ 8,000 @entity80 fine for stepping onto the pitch at @entity82 , but they have been offended by this episode			1
another point of contention concerns warning letters received by some fans , who have threatened to withdraw season tickets because they have been identified as persistent standers during games by stewards and security officials using @entity95			2

‘ i understand @entity5 ’s point , ’ added @entity62			2
‘ @entity4 are top of the league and fans should sing for 100 minutes , let alone 90			1
but the culture in @entity107 football has changed and some fans who come into the ground now are more interested in taking selfies than getting behind the team			0
‘ if we were winning four or five - nil he would n’t have said anything , but when he sees us struggling against a team second from bottom , he lets himself down			0
i know what he can be like			0
’ it was a full house at @entity7 for the visit of west @entity118 rivals @entity26			2
