the false widow was first spotted in the @entity81 in @entity95 , @entity96 , in 1879 , and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from @entity101 or the @entity102 in a shipment of bananas			1
the @entity105 says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the @entity81 , having been found mainly in southern @entity108			0

' if he sees a creepy - crawly he will yell to me ' do n't look ' until @entity24 has moved it away			2
' mrs @entity6 said the bites have affected her family			2
she is now very reliant on her husband and ca n't hug her children before they go to school @entity81 homes may be set for an invasion of larger than normal spiders who have feasted on an abundance of prey in the last few months , according to experts			1
that ’s because this year the warm summer has allowed certain spiders to eat more than usual and grow to their upper limits			2
and it could mean we ’ll see more and more large spiders in our homes in the coming months			0
the mild summer has meant the eight - legged creatures have had plenty to eat and very few have perished			0
with temperatures set to fall , experts from @entity203 have said the larger - than - usual house spiders will be heading indoors in the coming weeks to find a mate			2
professor @entity209 , of the @entity210 , agreed with their predication and said : ‘ this year has been seemingly a good one for the invertebrates which spiders feed on , and it ’s quite mild out there			2
’ both sexes stay in their webs until the autumn when the males become nomadic and search for females			0
mr @entity221 of the @entity222 told @entity223 that people often notice larger spiders this year as the cold weather drives them inside , with males hunting for females			2
but he agrees that the particularly mild summer we ’ve had , not too hot and not too cold , will have given spiders access to more prey .			0
