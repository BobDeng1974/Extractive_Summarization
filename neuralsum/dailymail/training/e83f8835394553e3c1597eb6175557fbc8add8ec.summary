it has perplexed astronomers since being dug up in 1999			0
the @entity2 is thought to have been made during the @entity3 in around 1600 @entity4 , and experts believe it could be the first ' sky map ' ever created			1
the bronze disc , about 32cm in diameter , has a gold inlay clearly representing the moon and / or sun and some stars			1
the @entity13 was discovered in @entity14 in 1999 as part of a hoard also containing two bronze swords , two small axes , a chisel and fragments of spiral bracelets			1
the disk 's recent history dates to 1999 , when two looters using metal detectors discovered the artifact , along with several bronze weapons and tools , in a wooded area near the @entity14 town of @entity2 , 100 miles southwest of @entity31			1
amateur archaeologists @entity33 and @entity34 tried to hawk the disk for $ 400 000 - and were seized by police officers in the basement bar of a touristy @entity39 hotel			0
after a short trial , the duo , along with the looters , were found guilty of illegally trafficking in cultural artifacts			2
experts believe the @entity13 was a calculator to help @entity3 people predict the best times for sowing and harvesting in spring and autumn			1
it recorded the fact that when the @entity50 , a very obvious group of stars in the night sky which are a familiar sight in the northern hemisphere in winter , were seen next to a new moon , that signaled the beginning of spring , when seeds should be sown , at the latitude of central @entity14			1
when the star cluster stood next to a full moon , it was a sign that fall had begun and it was harvest time			1
the @entity13 was discovered in @entity14 in 1999 as part of a hoard also containing two bronze swords , two small axes , a chisel and fragments of spiral bracelets			1
a small piece in wood found in one of the swords allowed scientists to date the hoard to around 1600 bc. the disc was also used to determine if and when a thirteenth month -- the so - called intercalary month -- should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons			1
the sophistication of the disk surprised many archaeologists			0
' we knew that people back then must have had a certain idea of the seasons and the @entity91 , as we all have , ' dr. @entity83 , a researcher and spokesperson for the @entity85 in @entity86 told @entity92			0
' there are depictions of the cosmos that are older , for example in the chamber tombs of the old pyramids in @entity99			0
the @entity13 was a calculator to help @entity3 people predict the best times for sowing and harvesting in spring and autumn			1
the small cluster of stars on the disc has been identified as the @entity50 , a very obvious group of stars in the night sky which are a familiar sight in the northern hemisphere in winter			1
the disk was developed in four stages : initially the disk had thirty - two small round gold circles , a large circular plate , and a large crescent - shaped plate attached ( left )			2
at some later date , two arcs ( constructed from gold of a different origin , as shown by its chemical impurities ) were added at opposite edges of the disk ( right )			2
to make space for these arcs , one small circle was moved from the left side toward the center of the disk and two of the circles on the right were covered over , so that thirty remain visible ( left )			0
the final addition was another arc at the bottom , the ' sun boat ' , again made of gold from a different origin			1
they disappear from view around 10 march and appear again around 17 october , close to the equinoxes which were important times for sowing and harvesting crops			0
at some point two bands were added to the outside edges			0
it is thought that the two bands relate to the rising and setting of the sun in midsummer and midwinter , allowing the people to pinpoint the solstices			2
' but they are schematic â€¦ as of today , there has never been something as concrete as the @entity2			0
' the @entity2 features the oldest concrete depiction of the cosmos worldwide			0
in june 2013 the @entity157 sky disk was included in the @entity159 's @entity158 calling it ' one of the most important archaeological finds of the 20th century			0
' the disk 's recent history dates to 1999 , when two looters using metal detectors discovered the artifact , along with several bronze weapons and tools , in a wooded area near the @entity14 town of @entity2 , 100 miles southwest of @entity31			2
