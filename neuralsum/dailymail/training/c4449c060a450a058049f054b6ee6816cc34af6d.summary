by @entity0 published : 17:09 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 03:38 est , 29 october 2013 graphic video footage showing three @entity3 allegedly murdering a wounded prisoner in @entity5 will not be released because it could put the lives of @entity8 troops ‘ at risk ’ , a judge ruled yesterday			1
judge advocate @entity10 said the ‘ shocking ’ dvd would be a propaganda gift to extremists and endanger @entity8 service personnel and civilians			1
the @entity16 and other media organisations had asked that images of the @entity3 shooting the severely wounded insurgent - already played in open court - should be made available publicly			1
members of the defence legal team at @entity24 ' sit next to a blue screen erected in the courtroom to hide the identities of three @entity3 accused of murder but the judge ruled the video clips so disturbing it could be used to ‘ incite attacks ’ against @entity8 troops and members of the public			1
film footage showing the blood - stained detainee being dragged across a field in @entity39 and shot at point blank range with a 9mm pistol in september 2011 was recorded by a camera mounted on the helmet of another marine			1
it was discovered by police investigating war crimes a year later			2
the marines , who can only be identified as @entity49 , are accused of ‘ executing ’ the stricken insurgent			2
a court martial in @entity52 has been told that @entity53 killed the man with a bullet to the chest and was helped and encouraged by @entity57 and @entity59 all three deny murder			0
arguing the video clips should not be released , senior @entity62 counter-terrorism expert @entity61 told @entity64 the images would go viral on @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 within minutes			2
he said : ‘ i ’ve seen nothing that surpasses it in terms of radicalisation potential			0
it ’s exceptionally worrying , there ’s nothing i have seen that matches its emotional power			0
it is a gift in propaganda terms			2
‘ i am confident that if made publicly available this footage would not only be used as propaganda material by terrorist organisations in order to radicalise others but would also be exploited by terrorist organisations to incite individuals to carry out terrorist acts			1
‘ releasing it would therefore present a real threat to life for members of the armed forces and the wider @entity8 public and for @entity8 interests overseas			2
’ the video has already been played in open court			1
this sketch shows members of the @entity98 scrutinising the video clip last week mr @entity61 said footage of incidents such as the abuse of prisoners at @entity104 in @entity105 or @entity106 @entity3 urinating on dead insurgents in @entity5 had been exploited by jihadists as propaganda			1
@entity110 , barrister for the media organisations , said there was no evidence releasing the footage would pose a ‘ real and immediate risk to life ’			1
she said there was a ‘ clear public interest ’ in publicising the images because it involved ‘ serious and important questions about the action of service personnel in conflict zones '			0
but in a written judgement , judge @entity10 said the dvd would ‘ generate significant feelings of anger and revenge among certain people and will incite attacks on @entity8 service personnel at home and abroad ’			1
he said the principle of open justice was ‘ immutable ’			0
but he added : ‘ it must be subject to exemptions particularly when dealing with threats posed by terrorist organisations which repeatedly attempt to radicalise people whom they can incite to commit atrocities			0
‘ releasing it for unrestricted public consumption would expose @entity8 service personnel to increased risk of harm unnecessarily			0
‘ i am not prepared to ignore his [ mr @entity61 ’s ] very stark warning to put the lives of @entity8 service personnel at risk			0
’ the court martial continues			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
