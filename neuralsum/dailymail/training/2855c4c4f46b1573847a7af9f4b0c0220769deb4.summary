by @entity1 reporter published : 11:47 est , 13 july 2013 updated : 01:04 est , 14 july 2013 when @entity3 saw her older brother swim away from their boat that had capsized in the choppy waters off the coast @entity8 to get help , she thought he had a 50 - 50 chance to make to ashore – but he was far less optimistic			1
in a phone interview with @entity15 saturday afternoon , the 43 - year - old @entity13 resident said that her heroic sibling later revealed to her that he thought he only had about 30 per cent chance to reach dry land alive			1
but @entity19 plowed ahead anyway , believing that it was the only way to save his sister , elderly father , 3 - year - old nephew and 9 - year - old niece , who were left clinging to the overturned boat in the gathering darkness following a thunderstorm tuesday			1
hero : 46 - year - old @entity29 ( right ) , of @entity30 , swam five hours against strong waves in the middle of a storm for help survivors : the family , including 3 - year - old @entity37 ( left ) and 9 - year - old @entity38 ( right ) , spent more than eight hours bobbing in the jellyfish - infested water patriarch : @entity29 , a 70 - year - old retired commercial waterman from @entity30 , organized the fishing trip ill - fated vessel : the @entity19 family headed off on a fish trip aboard their 16 - foot @entity47 after swimming for about five hours , mr @entity19 was able to climb ashore and get help , leading rescuers to his family stranded in the middle of the jellyfish - infested @entity53			1
miss @entity3 said that aside for a few stings and some scrapes and bruises , the entire family is doing well as they continue to recover from the terrifying ordeal			2
her 3 - year - old son , @entity37 , is still thinking about the accident and had a nightmare recently , but the mother said that the toddler is eager to go fishing again			1
since tuesday , @entity19 , 46 , has been hailed a hero by national media outlets for his bravery , but according to his sister , he does n’t think he had done anything extraordinary			1
‘ he is a very modest and shy sort of guy , ’ she explained			0
‘ he shakes his head a lot			0
’ the @entity19 family and @entity3 's 9 - year - old niece visiting from @entity78 were out fishing for croaker off @entity80 , @entity8 , tuesday			1
they were about five hours into their outing and nearly ready to head home when a sudden thunderstorm descended on the area , churning the waters in @entity53			0
their boat was only 16 feet long , and @entity89 , who has been fishing in these parts for a decade , immediately knew they were in trouble			1
‘ we took a wave over the stern , and i saw the water and went and grabbed a life jacket for my niece , ’ she recalled			2
at that point , their small vessel may have had a chance to recover if not for the two additional waves that overwhelmed the boat , flipping it over			0
miss @entity3 just had enough time to put a life preserve over her toddler son			1
rescued : @entity38 , 9 , was among those saved from a capsized boat mortal danger : @entity3 was especially worried about her elderly father ( left ) , who wears a pacemaker , and the young children on board man on a mission : @entity29 swam for five and a half hours to shore to raise the alarm and get help when their boat capsized , @entity19 ' brother and father swam under to get lifejackets for the rest of the family , which ultimately has proven to be a life - saving move			1
miss @entity3 was especially concerned for her 70 - year - old father , who has a pacemaker , and the two young children in their care , so she made sure they stayed close to the overturned boat			1
the 16 - foot - long @entity47 dubbed bathtub , which belongs to miss @entity3 ' father , capsized about 2 miles off the coast and then drifted about 5 miles in a parallel direction when the tide turned			1
at first , the 43 - year - old mother said that the water felt fairly warm and even ' nice , ' with only jellyfish and sea nettles pestering the family			1
but as it grew darker , the stinging critters became the least of their worries			0
‘ the bigger problem was the cold , and we were just shivering and shivering , ’ @entity3 recalled in the interview			2
the area is also a known habitat of the small but aggressive bull sharks , but miss @entity3 said she tried not to think of that while bobbing in the water			1
@entity19 and @entity3 ' father , also named @entity19 , is a 70 - year - old retired commercial waterman from @entity30 , @entity8 , who organized the fishing trip for his children and grandchildren , 3 - year - old @entity165 , and 9 - year - old @entity166 , a fourth - grader visiting from @entity167			1
near tragedy : the boat overturned two miles from short			0
after calling 911 , @entity29 went on a rescue boat with volunteer firefighters to find his family in the pitch black as time passed and the temperature of the water dropped , miss @entity3 noticed that her young son was dozing off and shivering uncontrollably			1
‘ at one moment i was terrified he was going to die in my arms , ’ the mother said of little @entity37			0
@entity19 knew that nobody was going to start looking for them until the next day , so she and @entity19 decided that their best chance for survival was to go out for help			2
' @entity19 and i looked at each other and he said , " should i try it ? " i knew he was talking about swimming to shore			2
so i told him to try it			0
but we had no idea if he would make it to shore , ' she added			0
defiant : miss @entity3 said that her young son @entity37 is eager to go back into the water ironically , @entity3 said that her brother , who works as a commercial fisherman , does not like swimming and is not good at it			1
thankfully , the 46 - year - old had a life jacket on , which helped him stay afloat as he slowly made his way towards the shore			1
but as minutes turned into hours and the water grew even colder , the mother became fearful that she would never see @entity19 again			1
to make matters worse , @entity3 saw that her elderly father was getting weaker			1
‘ i started to think there ’s going to be a double funeral , ’ she said			0
after swimming for five hours , the 46 - year - old finally made it to dry land			1
' @entity19 made it to the beach but he was so tired , he could not walk			2
so he crawled to the nearest house he saw			0
luckily they had dogs , which woke the family up			0
and even luckier for us , that family had the personal number for the fire chief , ' @entity19 told @entity229 news station friday			2
while waiting for rescue , miss @entity3 was doing her best to keep everyone 's spirits up by being positive			2
to stop the kids from crying , she would chat with them about the first thing they would like to do the following day and prattle on about trivial things like eating ice cream and watching movies			0
when her 9 - year - old niece turned fearful , saying that they will never make it home , miss @entity3 would reassure her that help was on the way			1
it was as they were talking that she noticed lights in the horizon			0
‘ my first thought was , ‘ thank @entity248 , they ’re going to find us , ” ’ @entity19 recalled saturday			2
back on dry land : on the boat were @entity19 ' 70 - year - old father , a 9 - year - old niece , @entity19 ' sister , @entity3 , and her 3 - year - old son initially , however , the first rescue boat that made it into the sound did not notice the family in the water and overshot them , not realizing that they had drifted from the location of the capsizing			1
‘ they did another loop , and that was just devastating , ’ she recalled			0
the stranded family tried to attract the attention of the rescuers by screaming and waving , but the genies of their boats drowned out their desperate cries for help			0
finally , a @entity278 helicopter hovering overhead shone a spotlight on the small group of people huddling around the overturned boat , guiding the rescuers to them			0
' there were a few storms in the area , and the boat turned upside down , ' said sgt. @entity288 at the @entity289			0
' mr. @entity19 swam to shore			2
these people are very lucky			0
' firefighters from @entity80 , @entity294 and @entity295 in @entity296 and @entity297 in @entity298 pulled alongside			0
the @entity299 also was on the scene , mr @entity288 said			2
desperate measures : @entity19 ( right ) was unable to walk when he came ashore , so he had to crawl for help optimist : determined to keep the children calm , @entity3 kept repeating that help was on the way helpless : @entity3 later recalled how her toddler son ( pictured ) cried and and shivered next to her in the frigid water volunteer firefighters pulled @entity19 and her family onto a boat but it was only until they were taken to a second boat that she was reunited with her brother			1
' it was the most amazing feeling			0
i ran up to @entity19 and said , ' you are my hero , ' @entity3 told @entity229 after the rescue			1
' i 'm so grateful to the first responders that came and helped us out			0
i was so happy to see them and i love all of them			0
and i am so proud of my family , especially my brother			0
' speaking to @entity15 saturday , @entity3 said , ‘ we were extremely , extremely lucky			2
it took us hours and hours to get warm again			0
’ @entity329 ’s boat has since been pulled out of the water and transported back to his yard			2
his daughter said that it is in good condition , but she will likely stay away from it – at least this summer .			0
