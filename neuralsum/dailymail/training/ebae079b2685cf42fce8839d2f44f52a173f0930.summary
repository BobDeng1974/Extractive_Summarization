@entity0 has played the role of the professor all season and sometimes he can make us feel like students in the classroom			1
but , a week on from a goalless draw in @entity8 , one of the great educational centres of the world , he still has a lot learn about his team			2
there were no signs of enjoyment or self - expression in that game and it looks like the players are weary of @entity22 ’s experimenting			2
@entity23 enjoyed a good unbeaten stretch but there were never any dominant displays in that run			1
they ground out results and often looked laboured			0
@entity31 scores as @entity32 beat @entity23 on the opening day of the season @entity0 has experimented a lot with his team but they have failed to convince in any formation can you really say there was much of a difference in the level of performance between the 0 - 0 last week and the opening - day defeat by @entity32 ? it ’s no secret @entity22 wants to play with a back three but it ’s so obviously flawed that even the fans feel compelled to tell him so			1
when he changed things at @entity49 , it looked like the penny had dropped			0
they stuck with a back four against @entity8 but with little success			0
it will be interesting to see if he reverts to a 3 - 5 - 2 on saturday because @entity23 are facing a team who love playing against a back three			1
@entity59 ’s best performances of the season have come against sides that play three at the back			2
they tore @entity23 apart in that stunning 5 - 3 win and produced a fine comeback from 2 - 0 down to draw at @entity66			1
wide men such as @entity68 and @entity69 are the perfect players to bomb forward and expose gaps left by defenders playing in a three			0
@entity69 will be missing — he is with @entity72 at the @entity73 — but @entity68 can cause @entity23 problems			1
@entity23 's players look dejected during their recent draw with @entity77 @entity78 walks off the pitch while the @entity8 players celebrate after the @entity82 clash @entity59 exposed @entity23 the last time they played back in september i played in a back three many times and if you are the widest defender you feel vulnerable			1
it ’s a system that places disproportionate demands on the wing backs to cover more ground than anyone else			0
if they do n’t drop back , the widest defender has to move across to cover the space			0
that leaves huge gaps for the opposition to fly into , as our graphic shows			0
when you ’re out of possession it drags your team shape all over the place and , unless your wing backs drop deep , it leaves you short of defenders in the box			0
@entity23 have struggled to get it right , @entity49 abandoned it after a few games and @entity66 only seem to be coming to grips with it now			1
@entity110 has used the system in the past , so he knows just how to exploit it , but @entity23 have had enough time to make it work			1
they have a squad capable of competing in four competitions , but are in only two			0
they have played 10 games fewer than @entity117 and @entity66 , nine less than @entity118 and eight fewer than @entity119			1
@entity120 celebrates scoring to put @entity59 in the lead at the @entity122 @entity22 has persisted with playing three at the back despite the problems he has faced that means more time on the training pitch but @entity22 overcomplicates things			2
he clearly feels he knows best , but does he ? a lot of @entity23 players have been used in multiple positions , which makes it harder to know their role			2
@entity134 has played up front , off the front and in midfield , @entity137 has played in midfield , off the front and as a striker and @entity142 has been used all over the place			0
then there are the defenders who have had to plug all sorts of gaps			0
however , things can change			0
at this stage last season , @entity66 had only three points more than @entity23 do now			1
and , with the advantage of playing only once a week , @entity153 ’ side came into their own in the second half of the campaign — they were absolutely flying			2
@entity22 arrived at @entity23 saying he could win the title this season			1
he is a long way from achieving that but if he can finally settle on a preferred system that suits these players then things will improve			0
it ’s time for him to stop experimenting and find the right formula to make @entity23 great again			1
every thursday i ’ll answer your questions live on @entity170			0

@entity23 are currently fourth in the @entity173 table
@entity0 's side are 12 points of league leaders @entity117
they lost to @entity32 at @entity180 on the first day of the season
they drew with @entity77 in the @entity82 recently
there does *n't* appear to have been any improvement during that time
