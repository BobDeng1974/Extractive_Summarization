' watch the crime rate when i get out			1
how about that ? ' @entity2 , who was dubbed ' one of @entity15 's most prolific burglars ' , was the first person in the @entity27 town to be given an asbo in 2003			1
he has 88 previous offences , including 25 theft - related crimes , the court was told			2
he was taken to court after police found a large sum of cash on him			2
