the grand @entity1 port of @entity2 , with its high - rise apartments overlooking the north @entity4 , is no match for @entity6 on a winter ’s night			1
but that was when @entity9 — or @entity9 for short — announced himself to @entity11 football and gave @entity6 fans a first inkling that they could end a 68 - year wait to return to the top flight of @entity11 football			1
now , after a mid-season stumble following the bizarre news that their manager @entity20 was going to be replaced at the end of the season regardless of whether the club earn promotion , they are entertaining realistic hopes of becoming one of the smallest clubs to have graced the @entity29			1

it was their first @entity29 meeting for 18 years and made sure @entity6 ’s neighbours knew there was a change of the guard in west @entity53			1
quite something for a 23 - year - old who struggled at @entity36 and then with @entity58 ’s reserves			2
‘ that derby was intense , a special moment for me			2
it felt i ’d really arrived at @entity6 that night , ’ said @entity9 , who will face @entity47 again at @entity59 on friday			1

’ @entity9 is relishing the competition in the championship and hopes to help @entity6 return to the top - flight @entity9 strikes the ball at @entity6 's training complex during his interview with @entity78 speaking in @entity1 , @entity9 sits inside a hut at their modest training complex with seven games — or possibly more in the play - offs — to achieve what appeared unobtainable			1
he was relaxed , at ease with the club ’s situation despite the upheaval in their management structure and laughed in agreement at the notion that no team appear to want to take charge of the promotion race , such is the absurdly close top eight			2
just one point separated the top five a fortnight ago			2
@entity9 was open on the serious problems they encountered after february ’s shocking developments regarding @entity20 ’s future			1
the popular boss will leave at the end of the season to be replaced by a foreign coach who buys into owner @entity106 ’s continental philosophy and @entity9 admitted the news seriously affected the squad			1

‘ you hear rumours … you do n’t know what ’s going to happen			0

’ @entity9 celebrates scoring the winning goal for @entity6 against rivals @entity47 at at @entity42 in november they have levelled just in time and are one point off the play - offs			1
@entity6 have an ace up their sleeve , too			1

he wants to do it again but in front of 90,000 at @entity139			0
‘ everyone has told me about this final at @entity139 , ’ he added			0
‘ achieve that in front of these supporters who have been so good to me ? it ’d be amazing			0
this would be truly historic , just as it was for @entity133			0
but we won the league there so this would be more dramatic			0
’ the similarities between @entity6 and @entity133 are stark			1
both have populations of 27,000 and while @entity6 have not seen the top flight since 1947 , @entity133 embarked on their first premier campaign in august			1
using his best @entity11 , @entity9 is trying to draw on last year ’s experience and explain it to others in the squad			1

everybody has expensive players , too			0
’ @entity9 did not come cheap , costing progressive @entity6 £ 1.5 million in the summer , and has been watched by @entity29 clubs			1
the top flight is where he wants to be and his girlfriend is in the process of moving over to @entity53			0
