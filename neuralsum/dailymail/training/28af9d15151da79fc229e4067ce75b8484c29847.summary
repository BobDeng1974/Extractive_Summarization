@entity1 aviation chiefs warned six months ago that a kind of @entity4 jet similar to the @entity6 plane that has gone missing was vulnerable to a mid-air break up			1
as searchers headed for a possible crash site for @entity11 , it emerged that the @entity1 @entity12 ordered airlines to fix a potentially fatal flaw in @entity4 jets			1
the @entity12 reportedly warned the planes could break apart and suffer a drastic loss in cabin pressure because of cracks in the fuselage			1
authorities have today insisted the plane had been ' fully serviced ' and all the maintenance checks ' were in order '			1
the @entity1 @entity12 ordered airlines to fix a potentially fatal flaw in @entity4 jets , like this one and like @entity11 , which has gone missing with all 239 passengers and crew airlines were given until april 9 this year to ' detect and correct cracking and corrosion in the fuselage skin ' beneath the passenger jets ' communications antennae			1
failure to do so would put the planes at risk in an ‘ airworthiness directive ’ ( @entity42 ) dated september 18 last year , airlines were given until april 9 this year to ‘ detect and correct cracking and corrosion in the fuselage skin ’ beneath the airliners ' communications antennae			1
failure to fix the flaw could put the aircraft at risk of ‘ a rapid decompression and loss of structural integrity of the airplane , ’ said the @entity12			1
one airline reportedly found a 16 inch crack ' under the 3 - bay satcom antenna adapter plate in the crown skin of the fuselage ' on a 14 - year - old airplane with approximately 14,000 total flight cycles			2
after this finding , the same operator inspected 42 other jets between six and 16 years old and found ' some local corrosion but no other cracking '			2
the ad applied to other @entity4 models and not the @entity4 , which is the model of the missing jet			2
@entity4 is said to have claimed the two models have different antennas			2
the directive said the warning applied to the @entity71 , @entity72 , -300 , -300er and -777f series airplanes			0
but according to a second report the @entity12 said it had also determined that this unsafe condition ' is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design '			2
an @entity80 @entity79 pilot looks out of a military surveillance airplane over the @entity83 straits during a search mission for missing @entity11 , which disappeared on saturday en - route to @entity85 an officer aboard a @entity88 military helicopter scours the waters in the area where the flight vanished experts were speculating last night that a failure to correct the flaw could possibly be behind the plan ’s disappearance with 239 people on board			1
analysts suggested that if the plane had lost pressure the pilots may have become disorientated and possible fly off course , leading to the confusion over its whereabouts			0
the @entity12 was not available for comment in @entity106 last night			2
but @entity107 , a former inspector general at the @entity1 @entity108 , was reported last night as saying : ‘ @entity4 put out a warning back in august , and it said the 777 had a problem with fuselage cracking			1
‘ i wonder what did n’t get done			0
if this plane had a problem and it had cracking or some sort of rapid decompression and lost the ability to communicate , it would make perfect sense			1
’ an official points to a map at the rescue command office on @entity123 , @entity88 the claim came as it was also reported that an it manager from @entity126 thinks he may have tracked down the missing @entity11			0
he reportedly used a satellite imaging website that allows people to comb vast distances			0
the @entity132 website allows people to work their way through satellite images square by square			0
one user , @entity136 , claimed it took him only a few minutes on sunday to come up with a possible match			0
' at first i skipped past it , thinking : " nah			0
no way i would find anything that quickly " , ' mr @entity136 told @entity143			0
' but then i kept scrolling back to it and thinking to myself , " it does resemble a plane "			0

@entity12 had ordered airlines to fix possibly fatal flaw in @entity4 777s by this april
it said they must ' detect and correct cracking and corrosion in the fuselage ’
failure to fix the flaw could put the aircraft at risk of ‘ a rapid decompression ’
@entity176 *defence* minister today said the plane had been ' fully serviced ' and all maintenance checks ' were in order '
