by @entity0 published : 12:11 est , 23 may 2012 updated : 07:18 est , 24 may 2012 ' @entity1 ' : @entity2 , the prime minister , lost his cool with @entity4 at @entity2 's questions today , calling the shadow chancellor an ' idiot ' @entity2 dismissed @entity4 as a ' muttering idiot ' after losing his temper with the shadow chancellor during a heated exchange at @entity2 's questions today			1
the prime minister 's unexpected outburst prompted a rebuke from commons speaker @entity15 , who told him to retract the slight as it was ' unparliamentary '			0
and @entity20 benches immediately leapt on mr @entity2 's loss of composure with cries of ' @entity1 ' - a reference to the bully in @entity26			2
the taunt is a favourite amongst @entity29 , who think mr @entity2 is at his weakest during @entity30 when he is visibly riled and angry			1
sources close to mr @entity4 claimed it was the shadow chancellor ’s demands for mr @entity2 to ' tell us about the recession ' that tipped the prime minister over the edge			1
but according to mps and political pundits on @entity39 , mr @entity4 sent the prime minister in to a spin by telling him to ' chillax , and have another glass of wine '			0
the jibe is a reference to a recently published book which claims mr @entity2 unwinds from the stresses of his job by drinking three or four glasses of wine with sunday lunch			1
by the time it came to a @entity56 statement on the @entity58 and @entity59 summit in @entity60 , mr @entity2 was in a conciliatory mood and volunteered an apology to @entity63 , the veteran mp @entity20 , who he urged to retire during a heated commons exchange last month			2
the barbed remark prompted accusations of ' ageism ' against mr @entity2			0
today he admitted his remark was ' sharp ' and insisted mr @entity63 was a ' tremendous ornament ' in the @entity56			0
to make matters worse for the pm , former chancellor @entity2 , to whom he was a special adviser when @entity73 crashed out of the @entity74 in 1992 , told the @entity75 ’s @entity76 that mr @entity2 could be ' quite volatile '			1
mr @entity2 ’s initial misdemeanour in @entity30 was unexpected , he had only begun to answer a seemingly innocuous question on the government ’s economic record			1
is @entity2 too ' chillaxed ' to run the country ? he said : ' what we need to do both in @entity73 and @entity85 is to combine deficit reduction , which has given us the low interest rates , with an active monetary policy , with structural reforms to make us competitive , and with innovative ways of using our hard - won credibility , which we would n’t have if we listened to the muttering idiot sitting opposite me			0
' after the speaker 's rebuke the @entity2 replied that he would replace the word ' idiot ' with the words ' the man who left us with this enormous deficit and this financial crisis '			0
@entity4 , left , and @entity103 : mr @entity2 's outburst prompted cries of ' @entity106 ' from the @entity20 benches - a reference to the bully in @entity26 - and a rebuke from commons speaker @entity15 speaking outside the @entity56 , a @entity20 source said : ' the prime minister is increasingly losing his temper and increasingly losing the @entity114 , because he is increasingly losing the economic argument			2
' it is deeply un-prime ministerial and a sign of his weakness on the key economic argument			0

shadow chancellor told him to ' chillax and have another glass of wine '
mr @entity2 seen as at his weakest during @entity30 when he loses his temper
