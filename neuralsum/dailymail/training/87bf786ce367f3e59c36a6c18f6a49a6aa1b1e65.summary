a statement from the @entity13 read : ' the @entity13 management team will take time to consider circumstances surrounding recent allegations about the player 's behaviour in public whilst on an agreed holiday period from @entity23 training			1
' no can do : @entity2 tries to get into @entity24 's , left , before being grabbed by bouncers , right ' the @entity13 operates to its own strict code of conduct covering behaviour both on and off the field , in circumstances of serious indiscipline the national squad management have the capacity to impose sanctions on players for matters arising from occasions when they are not on official squad duty , ' the statement continued			1
' whilst the suspension is in operation further clarification regarding the incident will be sought			2
' the suspension has been approved by @entity13 head coach @entity43 and agreed by the senior squad management team			1
the @entity13 has not been alerted of any criminal action and the suspension is based on its own behaviour protocols			1
' @entity2 , who sealed a move to @entity51 @entity50 club @entity48 from @entity52 earlier this week on a two - year deal , is now expected to face questions over the allegations			2
@entity13 chief executive @entity56 explained @entity2 's suspension was a result of a ' breach of standards '			1
' discipline and acceptable behaviour are issues which run to the core values of the @entity13 and we can not tolerate any compromise of those standards , ' he said			1
' @entity2 is an exceptional player , but there is irrefutable evidence of a prima facie nature that he was engaged in behaviour which falls below the standards we set			2
' it is vitally important that we send out a clear and unambiguous message to one and all concerning our views on matters of this sort			0
no way out : @entity2 is wrestled to the ground , left , before the police arrive , but no arrests were made ' that message must be heard clearly by all players , coaches , administrators , volunteers , supporters and , of course , the parents and guardians of any child attracted to take part in the national sport of @entity13			1
' by taking decisive action now we are emphasising that this sort of incident is highly unusual in that the majority of people involved in @entity3 rugby help us maintain the proud record we have for fair play and off the field courtesy			0
former love : @entity106 with his former girlfriend , the singer @entity107 ' our senior national squad players are highly visible because of the profile which accompanies the success of our national sport and it is made clear to them that they are the ambassadors we rely on to foster and sustain our image			0
' an incredible amount of hard work is currently taking place as our players prepare for the @entity118 in @entity119 and that effort must be recognised and supported by all involved			2
' i am making my views public at this time because , as the nation anticipates our involvement in @entity118 there is no room for any ambiguity in our reasoning			0
' @entity118 is part of the culture of our nation and we must do all in our power to ensure that the game remains a sport that everyone in @entity13 can be rightly proud of			1
' @entity2 has been replaced by @entity137 in @entity13 ' @entity139 training squad			1
