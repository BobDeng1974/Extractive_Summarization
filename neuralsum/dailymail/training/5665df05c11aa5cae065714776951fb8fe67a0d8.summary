@entity1 ’s finances are set for a boost after it emerged they are ready to renegotiate their current kit deal with sportswear giants @entity4			1
@entity1 still have three - years left on the deal - worth £ 12million a year – they signed almost three years ago but the club ’s on - field success and off - field value has continued to grow since then and it is understood that both sides are now ready to get round the negotiating table again			1
the @entity13 champions will not be able to match the astronomical sums neighbours @entity16 rake in – their deal with adidas which kicks in next season is worth £ 75m - a - year – but nevertheless @entity1 will expect to agree a significantly increased sum this time round			1
