by dr @entity0 @entity1 : 17:00 est , 28 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:34 est , 29 december 2013 he was simply doing what he does best : getting up the noses of the pompous and overpaid elite			1
my colleague @entity7 is unarguably a brilliant polemicist			1
but i was particularly intrigued by his recent showdown on @entity10 with actor @entity11			1
the short item on drug courts – the suggestion by a government think - tank that former addicts sit as lay magistrates dealing with abuse - related crimes – ended in a slanging match			1
@entity20 to head : actor @entity11 clashed with writer @entity7 over the treatment of drug addicts in a debate on @entity10 @entity7 baited the @entity25 star , a self - confessed addict , by saying the whole debate was pointless as addiction itself is a fiction – it ’s a view he has often aired , and presumably the reason he was invited on the show			1
@entity11 , who played @entity31 in the tv show but has reinvented himself as an ambassador for addiction recovery , having managed it himself , obviously did n’t agree			1
in fact , he seemed completely floored by @entity7 ’s curveball , and claimed addiction was an ‘ allergy ’ , which is just completely wrong , and an ‘ obsession ’			1
the whole thing descended into name - calling and i was left yelling coherent answers on his behalf at the tv			2
@entity7 claims that addiction is simply an excuse for lack of willpower , and ‘ no more real than @entity51 ’			1
is he right ? well , yes and no. addiction is a common problem not limited to @entity55 stars			1
there is a seedy side			2
but a huge number of those who are dependent on alcohol , cigarettes or tablets ( often , first prescribed to control another illness ) are ordinary @entity64 who do n’t know they ca n’t stop until they try			2
one thing on many minds in january will be giving up smoking			2
many others will be shocked to find forgoing their evening couple of glasses of wine for the january ‘ dryathlon ’ impossible , and may be compelled to seek help with their drinking			0
battle : the debate between the ex-drug addict friends star and the columnist heated up when @entity7 said addiction is ' no more real than @entity51 ' i commonly see cancer patients who are addicted to their prescription pain drugs or sleeping pills – drugs that they ’d never have chosen to take if it was n’t for their illness			1
and thousands more are dependent on over-the - counter pain medication containing codeine			0
we need to stop debating whether people need to just ‘ pull themselves together ’ , and start looking at finding better psychological support , which is proven to work , because addiction can wreck physical health and emotional wellbeing , and tear families apart			1
during the debate , @entity7 asked a clever question : he challenged @entity11 to provide evidence of an ‘ objective diagnosis ’ , which i think means a blood test or scan that would prove a person is addicted to something			1
as well he knows , there is no such thing			0
but we do n’t have a test or scan that proves the existence of many long - term illnesses – i could reel off a long list , but let ’s just focus for the moment on @entity117			0
like many illnesses , there is no quantifiable chemical or test one can use to ‘ prove ’ the diagnosis			0
that does n’t mean @entity117 ’s is ‘ imagined ’			0
it just means we do n’t yet know enough about the brain and nervous system to pinpoint a physical sign			0
but we do know a bit about the neurological processes that drive both addiction and @entity117 ’s			1
research at the @entity132 has shown through brain imaging that even after one or two doses of cocaine , mice develop brand new neurological pathways			0
these pathways lead the mice to pursue more cocaine , even though it jeopardises their usual feeding and drinking routine : just like a human addict prioritising drug - seeking behaviour over everything else			1
debate : last week 's mail on sunday whether or not these animals have willpower , no one knows			1
but the research does suggest something physical happens in the brains of those who are addicted			0
in human studies , scans have shown that areas in the brains of addicts ‘ light up ’ when they are exposed to the object of their desire			0
numerous studies have shown a rise in the brain chemical dopamine which occurs in response to addictive vices , whether gambling or drugs			1
dopamine is a neurotransmitter , a naturally occurring chemical produced by the brain that sends messages between nerve cells and signals pleasure			0
evolutionary neuroscience suggests that this compound is intrinsic to our ability to learn – it acts like a ‘ save button ’ and helps us remember to do things by giving us a good feeling when we do them			0
famously , the psychologist @entity186 showed that even the anticipation of pleasure can elicit a physical response : his dog salivated at the sight of food , and by @entity186 ringing a bell as he served it , eventually , his dog salivated as soon as he heard the bell , without food being present			0
addiction is simply this reward process gone awry			1
studies show that once people are addicted to a drug , the dopamine in their system spikes even with the expectation of ‘ the hit ’ , and if it does n’t come , the dopamine levels drop sharply			1
interestingly , @entity117 ’s is treated with synthetic dopamine – the chemical is also involved in co-ordinating movement			0
case studies have been reported from the @entity213 , where patients treated with dopamine - enhancing drugs developed a brand new gambling addiction , despite no previous addictive tendencies			1
this addictive behaviour halted abruptly when the drug was stopped			2
while case studies are not proof , this certainly adds to the body of evidence that addiction is not merely a state of mind			2
it seems nonsensical to say that addiction can not be physiological because willpower is essentially the main treatment			2
psychological therapies and ‘ mind - over - matter ’ are considered a gold - standard treatment for a multitude of conditions , including those with a very physical cause , such as back pain , and those without , like depression			0
are we therefore also to conclude these conditions do not exist ? of course not			0
the same is true of addiction			2
but in my area , a patient can wait for many months for a psychotherapy referral , by which time an addict ’s resolve may well have crumbled			0
it ’s not good enough			0
doctors are not in the business of deciding which of our patients are deserving and which are n’t			0
we are not the moral guardians of society deciding whether patients should be treated if they are smokers or over-eaters who become obese			0
the same is true for addiction ; whether its origins are in @entity55 or somewhere far less glamorous			2
addiction in my mind is like any other disease : it requires a non-judgmental medical approach and an acceptance of the problems , both physical and mental , that need attention .			2
