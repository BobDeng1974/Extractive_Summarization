by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:58 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 10:38 est , 11 february 2013 @entity4 ' shareholders could have been misled over a £ 3billion investment by the owner of @entity7 , it was alleged today			1
the bank said in 2008 that @entity9 had agreed to invest the money , which helped it avoid a taxpayer bailout - but , in fact , the money came from @entity15 ’s government			1
@entity9 was said to be providing half of a £ 7billion input , but @entity18 found that @entity4 was told the investor might change shortly before shareholders backed the deal			1
investment : @entity9 was said to be providing half of a £ 7billion input , but @entity18 found that @entity4 was told the investor might change shortly before shareholders backed the deal the bank allegedly decided to remain silent until this change was confirmed a few hours later			1
it claimed to have later provided ‘ appropriate disclosure ’ in three prospectuses released the next day			0
but this was allegedly buried in the small print , and still referred to ‘ his investment ’ in respect of @entity9 , despite knowing he was not in fact investing in the bank , reported @entity18			1
he was still referred to as the investor in the 2008 and 2009 annual reports			2
@entity4 claimed this was a ‘ drafting error ’ and the prospectus information was ‘ appropriate in all the circumstances ’			2
a @entity4 spokesman said : ' we have repeatedly demonstrated to @entity18 why the allegations which they plan to make in their programme are completely unjustified			1
' @entity4 is satisfied that the steps taken to disclose the change in ownership of the companies which were investing in the bank in 2008 were entirely appropriate			1
the change in ownership of the investing companies had no bearing on the transaction or required approvals			0
' @entity9 has an estimated wealth of around £ 20billion			2
the investment happened at a time of global economic meltdown , when @entity64 and @entity65 had to ask the government for a bailout			2
changes : @entity4 boss @entity69 is to scrap the company 's tax avoidance unit in a bid to move away from the bank 's scandal - hit past the @entity18 programme comes as it was revealed the bank will shut down a controversial unit used to slash tax bills in a bid to ‘ shred ’ the legacy left by former boss @entity83			1
critics last night welcomed the move but baulked at the idea that the lender has had a ‘ @entity89 moment ’ over its ethics			0
@entity4 , which is fighting to salvage its reputation after a string of scandals , will unveil the plans after its financial results tomorrow , when it counts the cost of its wrongdoing			2
it is expected to slash up to 2,000 ‘ casino bankers ’ at its investment arm @entity101 as part of a shake - up			0
but in its most eye - catching bid to convince the public that it is improving its culture , it will also announce the closure of its structured capital markets business			0
this secretive division helps companies avoid tax through a network of offshore tax havens and was previously run by its highest - paid banker @entity113			0
but it has also been used by @entity4 to cut its own tax bill in the @entity115 , heaping pressure on ordinary households to bridge the £ 32billion annual shortfall in @entity120 ’ coffers			1
last year it was ordered by the @entity121 to repay half a billion pounds after being caught out using two ‘ aggressive ’ loopholes to avoid paying tax			0
@entity4 chief executive @entity69 will describe the activities of its tax - avoidance arm as ‘ legal ’ but ‘ incompatible with our purpose ’ , pledging ‘ a new approach for a new era of banking ’			1
in the closest the bank has come to admitting widespread tax avoidance , he will admit that in some cases the unit ‘ relied on sophisticated and complex structures , where transactions were carried out with the primary objective of accessing the tax benefits ’			1
he will say : ‘ we get it			0
the old ways were n’t the right way to behave nor did they deliver the right results – for banks themselves or for wider society			0
job cuts : the move will see some 2,000 investment banking jobs axed by the firm ‘ there must be a new approach for a new era of banking			2
banks that fail to change will become failing banks			0
my message is @entity4 is changing			2
’ the move comes amid fresh accusations that @entity4 helped clients avoid tax on an ‘ industrial ’ scale			1
in the @entity18 investigation aired on @entity163 tonight , a former insider will claim that the small team of 100 staff at the structured capital markets unit would share huge rewards from the profits of tax avoidance deals			1
scandal : the closure is part of mr @entity69 ' drive to ' shred ' the legacy left by former boss @entity83 who resigned following the bank 's £ 290 million libor rigging settlement last year ‘ some tax restructuring is common in a lot of banks , and there ’s nothing wrong with it			0
the issue is they turned it into an industry within the bank			0
’ the tax avoidance arm was run by @entity113 , a former boyfriend of supermodel @entity189 , who made as much as £ 40million a year before leaving the bank in 2009			1
mr @entity69 , 57 , is also one of several current and former @entity4 executives being investigated by the @entity192 and the @entity194 watchdog over fees paid to @entity197 investors during the financial crisis			2
campaigners welcomed @entity4 ’ decision to close its tax avoidance arm but said it needed to be accompanied with a reform of the system to make it harder for companies to dodge tax			1
@entity207 , from the @entity208 ’ @entity209 , said : ‘ companies shutting down controversial units might ease public anger but it does n’t solve the problem of our broken tax system			0
' ' until it is reformed the public will remain deeply unhappy when they see companies able to exploit relief and loopholes simply not open to the rest of us			0
’ chief executive mr @entity69 admitted to the banking commission of mps and peers last week that the overhaul of his bank amounted to ‘ shredding ’ the legacy left by his predecessor mr @entity83			0
he admitted that an ‘ aggressive ’ and ‘ self - serving ’ culture had developed under the @entity231			0
@entity4 last night said it paid its fair share of tax in the @entity115 , having paid £ 300million of corporation tax on profits of £ 1billion in 2011 .			1

@entity4 said in 2008 that @entity9 had agreed to invest money
but money had come from @entity15 government , reports @entity18
@entity242 will also be closing tax avoidance unit resulting in 2,000 job losses
