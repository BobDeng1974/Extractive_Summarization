by @entity0 sacked : science teacher @entity1 was sacked after he accidentally shot 17 - year - old pupil @entity2 in the leg with a pellet gun during a classroom experiment a teacher has been sacked after he accidentally shot a pupil with an air gun			1
but the boy he injured has begun a @entity12 campaign calling for him to be given his job back			0
popular physics teacher @entity1 had been demonstrating an experiment to measure the deceleration of a pellet as it passed through sheets of paper when the freak accident occurred			1
the pellet apparently deflected off a table , hitting 17 - year - old as - level pupil @entity2 in the leg			1
yesterday , as the @entity12 page he set up in support of mr @entity1 passed 2,170 ‘ likes ’ , @entity2 said a safety pin could have caused him more harm			1
he said he decided to study physics because of the 53 - year - old teacher ’s ability to ‘ make the subject come alive ’			0
about 20 lower - sixth formers at @entity33 , @entity34 , volunteered to hold sheets of paper at arms - length over a line of desks , @entity2 said			2
he was about three - quarters of the way down the line when he was struck			0
‘ the bullet travelled through the first ten or 11 sheets , then it must have hit a desk below and cannoned into me , ’ he said			0
‘ it was just a momentary pain , like when you walk into the corner of a table			0
i was left with just a scratch			0
’ following the accident in november , mr @entity1 was ‘ extremely concerned and apologetic ’ and the experiment was halted			0
@entity2 mentioned the incident to his mother that night , and she spoke to the school			2
mr @entity1 was suspended soon afterwards and dismissed last week following a disciplinary hearing			1
it is understood that he was found guilty of gross misconduct			0
@entity2 said he has written to school governors in protest at mr @entity1 ’s dismissal			1
a source said senior figures at the school were aware that head of science mr @entity1 had sometimes used a pellet gun – which is legal for adults to buy and possess – in experiments			1
popular : while some parents at the school have labelled mr @entity1 ' irresponsible ' , pupils including @entity2 have started a campaign calling for him to be re-instated yesterday father - of - two mr @entity1 , who lives with wife @entity74 , 54 , in @entity75 , @entity76 , said he wanted his job back but refused to comment further for fear of jeopardising his appeal against dismissal			1
friends said the teacher was ‘ devastated ’ at the loss of his unblemished 20 - year career at the school			0
but one parent said : ‘ i ca n’t believe a teacher thought it was appropriate to take a gun into a school			2
surely there are safer ways to do this experiment than taking a deadly weapon into the classroom ? ’ disciplined : the incident happened in november and it is believed mr @entity1 was suspended soon afterwards , before being permanently sacked this week campaign : dozens of pupils past and present left comments on the @entity12 page @entity102 2014 , calling mr @entity1 a ' true inspiration ' , the ' best teacher ever ' and ' the king of @entity106 's ' head teacher @entity107 said mr @entity1 was sacked after a full investigation			1
‘ as we are still in the appeal phase of the process , it would be inappropriate to comment any further , ’ he added			0
@entity2 said pupils taught by mr @entity1 in 1997 had offered support on his @entity12 page , bring back @entity116 2014			1
@entity117 , 17 , said : ‘ we ’re infuriated about this and mr @entity1 has been humiliated			2
’ @entity119 , a former @entity120 teacher at @entity106 ’s , said mr @entity1 was ‘ one of the best teachers i ’ve ever had the privilege of teaching with ’ .			2

@entity1 used a pellet gun to demonstrate bullet deceleration to pupils
@entity128 discharged and pellet *ricocheted* off a table hitting @entity2 , 17
@entity1 was suspended and then sacked last week following an investigation

however , @entity2 has called for his *favourite* teacher to be re-instated
