if a woman experiences persistent symptoms , it could be the result of post-natal depression			1
the cause is not completely clear and experts think it is the result of a combination of things including lack of support , money worries or a difficult delivery			0

factors that increase your risk of having postnatal depression include a family history of depression or post-natal depression or experiencing other mood disorders such as bipolar disorder			1
huge changes in hormone levels during and after pregnancy were once believed to be the sole cause of post-natal depression			2
this is no longer thought to be the case , although hormonal changes may still play a part .			0
