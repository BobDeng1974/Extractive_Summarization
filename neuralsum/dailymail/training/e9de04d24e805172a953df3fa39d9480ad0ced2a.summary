by @entity0 @entity0 returns for his latest @entity1 , all about the @entity2			1
@entity0 was not selected by @entity3 for a place in @entity5 this summer but was involved in the @entity7 squad during the qualifying campaign			1
he runs the rule over @entity7 's first game of the campaign against @entity12 , the unfortunate nature of their defeat and how they can improve going forward			1
well , where do i start ? after all of the hype and excitement over the last few weeks , our opening game of the @entity2 ended in defeat			0
however , losing to the 2006 @entity24 was certainly no disgrace and i felt that there were plenty of positives to take from the performance			0
i thought the selection was bold in the first place and that the lads gave a good account of themselves but football is a results business , especially in a @entity2 competition when you only have three games to get it right , and we are now in a perilous position with only one game played			1
frustration : @entity7 were a bit unfortunate to lose to @entity12 , according to @entity0 that is n’t to say it ’s not possible			1
the flair , speed and dynamism which we showed in @entity49 was far more entertaining than any of the @entity7 games i have watched in our last few tournaments , and it leaves me very optimistic that we can get the necessary results against @entity55 and @entity56 to make it to the knockout stage			1
despite the defeat against @entity12 i thoroughly enjoyed the game , and felt right up until the referee blew the final whistle that we were capable of getting an equalising goal , and that has n’t always been the case in the past			1
i expected @entity67 to be a class act and i was n’t disappointed			1
he pulled the strings for an @entity71 side that was terrific in possession			2
he is such an intelligent player he never seems to get caught in possession			0
in fact , each of their midfield players looked comfortable when receiving the ball in tight spaces and that ’s the mark of quality			1
plenty of short passes and a very patient approach , which worked in really humid conditions			0
pass master : @entity67 recorded a pass completion rate of 93.2 per cent against @entity7 @entity12 only pressed forward when they were ready so they were able to conserve energy and retain control of the ball			1
it ’s true that they did n’t hurt us too much when they did attack us but i thought they wore us down over the course of the 90 minutes			0
@entity7 looked sharp and exciting and , as i stated , that ’s really not the norm from us in these tournaments			1
ironically , we posed more of an attacking threat than @entity12 but they always looked more in control			1
when our attacks broke down we always seemed to be expending more energy trying to re-shape to cope with any counter moves			0
and let me tell you , it ’s mentally harder to run about when you have n’t got the ball			0
if i was disappointed in any aspect of the @entity7 display it was that we did n’t capitalise on our goal			1
we did n’t force ourselves on the @entity71 after drawing level			0
with the pace in our midfield and attack i would have liked us to have been a bit braver after @entity122 ’s goal			1
celebration : @entity7 players celebrate after @entity122 nets the equaliser we certainly have a goal threat in us and if we keep clean sheets against our next two opponents then i have no doubt that we can win the games			1
the matches against @entity55 and @entity132 will present different challenges to those we faced against @entity12			1
i think both those teams will allow us to attack them more and try to frustrate us			0
it will be even more crucial not to concede the first goal			0
as for my team - mates against @entity12 , i thought @entity140 was outstanding			1
his goal - line clearance was typical of him			2
he read the situation early enough to get himself into a position to be able to head the ball away and save a certain goal			0
it was a testing night for @entity147 defensively			1
i felt sorry for him			0
he was left 2 v 1 on numerous occasions , and at this level the top players will make you pay for that			0
it also meant he could n’t bomb forward like he does at @entity157 which is a big part of his game			0
clearance : @entity140 heading the ball off the line following @entity164 's shot on goal when he does that for @entity157 he knows he ’ll be well covered if the forward move breaks down			0
i ’m not sure he has that confidence with @entity7			2
people have stated that he did n’t get enough help from @entity170 and that could be right but then i do n’t think wide left is @entity170 ’s best position			2
having trained and played with @entity170 many times i believe he should be right behind the front one or two			2
it gives him more freedom and as a truly world class player he has the ability to unlock any defence that this @entity2 can offer			0
@entity178 and @entity170 will make a big impact on the @entity2 , of that i have no doubt			2
struggle : @entity170 had a tricky night on the left for @entity7 on saturday and so can @entity183			1
i was made up when he came on and i thought he gave a really mature display			0
his passing was accurate and that ’s essential in the conditions and he gave @entity3 something to think about			0
i personally would start @entity183 against @entity55			2
the kid looks so ready to take his opportunity and he looks like the @entity2 stage is perfect for him			0
finally , our next game will bring together @entity194 and @entity195			2
there ’s no doubt that @entity195 is also a world class talent and he deservedly won our @entity200 award but he ’s not 100percent fit , that much seems clear			1
his country looked ordinary without him against @entity56 and i am confident that @entity194 and @entity203 can look after him on thursday			0
it ’s not a case of ‘ stop @entity195 and you stop @entity55 ’ because they have other good players but he ’s their king - pin			1
he ’s the one they need firing on all cylinders and stopping him will be crucial for our @entity2 dreams			0
he will be desperate to put one over on @entity7 , you can be sure of that ! not as much as he seems to like putting one over @entity157 ! waiting : @entity195 should be fit to face @entity7 after sitting out @entity55 's defeat to @entity56 but he ’ll be keen to do well when he knows our whole country is watching him and willing him to fail on the night			1
i ’m really looking forward to watching our next game now			0
the exciting manner in which we played shows we can watch @entity7 and be very entertained at the same time			1
however , it ’s win or bust against @entity55 for us now			2
we simply have to make sure that we get the three points			0
if we win and @entity12 and @entity56 draw it throws the group wide open			2
if we win and @entity12 win it puts them clear and us level with our final opponents but if we win and @entity56 win then it means ... oh let ’s just look after ourselves hey ! let ’s leave the permutations and consequences until friday morning			2
i just hope you ’re all enjoying it because i am .			0

@entity0 thinks @entity7 gave a good account of themselves against @entity12
@entity67 was the class act on the night pulling the strings in midfield
@entity7 looked exciting but should have been braver after equaliser
@entity170 and @entity147 can both recover from difficult nights
@entity195 will cause *problems* for @entity7 on his @entity55 return
@entity0 supports @entity257 and @entity258 . for more *information* *log* on to : claire - *house.org.uk* and *www.make-a-wish.org.uk*
