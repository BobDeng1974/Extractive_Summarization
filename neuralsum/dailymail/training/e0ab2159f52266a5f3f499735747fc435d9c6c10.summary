the 26 - story @entity8 - style skyscraper , known to some as the ' @entity1 ' for its similarity to the @entity12 headquarters in the old tv show , is losing its sole tenant this month			1
no one is moving in , and the building , the most distinctive feature on the @entity19 skyline , will no longer be fully illuminated at night , if at all , its owner says			1
going dark : the 26 - story @entity8 - style skyscraper , known to some as the ' @entity1 ' for its similarity to the @entity12 headquarters in the old tv show , is losing its sole tenant this month namesake : the skyscraper is known to some as the ' @entity1 ' for its similarity to the @entity12 headquarters in the old tv show it 's a blow for the city and the state , which had 9.4 per cent unemployment in february and has had one of the worst jobless rates in the nation for years			1
@entity34 , a senior lecturer in real estate at @entity36 , says 111 @entity37 , as the building is also known , will be ' the ultimate urban pothole			2
' at 428 feet , or about one - third the height of the @entity41 , it was the tallest skyscraper in @entity42 when it opened in 1928 as the @entity43			1
it has housed a bank ever since			2
that 85 - year run will end when @entity46 ends its lease for the building 's entire 380,000 square feet and completes its move into more modern space nearby in the coming days			1
the bank most recently occupied only about 20 percent of the building , says @entity53 , a spokesman for its owner , @entity55 , @entity56			2
disappointment : the loss of the building 's final tenant is a blow for the city and the state , which had 9.4 per cent unemployment in february and has had one of the worst jobless rates in the nation for years @entity67 says it does not want to use it as offices			1
the building represents such a large share of downtown office space , @entity70 says , that it would flood the market to do that			1
instead , @entity67 wants to turn it into about 290 apartments			2
but the company has offered no timetable for the project or said how much it might cost			0
@entity67 says it will need to persuade state lawmakers to revive a program that gives tax credits for rehabilitating historic buildings			0
vacant : @entity46 is set to end its lease for the building 's entire 380,000 square feet and completes its move into more modern space nearby in the coming days mayor @entity90 says he is disappointed the skyscraper will be vacant and he will do what he can to make sure it has a productive use			1
but he has n't committed himself to any specific course of action			0
in the meantime , the @entity98 building will stand dark and empty			1
that 's a mistake , says @entity34 , who lives in @entity19			0
he likens the significance of the building in @entity19 to the @entity41 in @entity103			2
' buildings like that are also advertisements about the city			0
it 's sending a signal to the rest of the city that we 're willing to write off this building , ' he says			2
rather than turning off the lights and letting it sit empty , @entity34 suggests a phased transition : keeping the lights on and possibly putting something in on the ground floor			0
in @entity121 , which is hurting much more than @entity19 and has many more vacant large buildings , the government has worked to find tenants for some empty properties			0
for example , the state moved some of its offices into @entity130 ' old corporate headquarters after @entity130 moved out			0
@entity2 gov @entity131 last year suggested the state move employees into the @entity98 building , but that idea has gone nowhere			1
@entity136 , has gone further			0
it taxes vacant and blighted properties at a higher rate , giving property owners a disincentive to sit on an empty building as they wait for a turnaround in the market or try to extract something such as tax breaks			2
@entity2 was once a manufacturing powerhouse and is still covered with old mill buildings , but many are vacant or have been turned into housing or office space			1
the state has struggled over the past 25 years or so to make the transition to a service and information economy			0
set in stone ? @entity2 was once a manufacturing powerhouse and is still covered with old mill buildings , but many are vacant or have been turned into housing or office space the most recent attempt was a $ 75million state loan guarantee handed out in 2010 to a video game company started by former @entity163 pitcher @entity162			1
the company declared bankruptcy last year , leaving taxpayers on the hook			0
given that debacle , it is unclear whether lawmakers have the appetite to grant what could be tens of millions of dollars in tax credits to get the @entity98 building back up and running , even given its significance to the state			1
@entity177 sits atop the city 's @entity178 and overlooks the skyscraper			2
@entity181 , an architect and assistant vice president for planning at the @entity185 school , says downtown is filled with beautiful , historic buildings , but the city needs to figure out how to ' reoccupy ' it			0
' there needs to be life on the street			0
people have to walk around and feel like there 's energy , ' he says			0
' then it encourages investment , it encourages entrepreneurs			0

the 26 - story skyscraper is known as the ' *superman* building ' *due* to its similarity to the @entity12 in the old @entity98 tv series
the building is set to go dark as its final tenant , @entity46 , leaves for other office space nearby
