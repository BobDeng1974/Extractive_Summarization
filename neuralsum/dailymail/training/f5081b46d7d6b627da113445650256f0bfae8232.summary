he has encountered several animals and pets including a dog who jumped into his van one day what you looking at ? moo - ve along ! he said over the years he has come across cross cows ( pictured ) while he encounters overly - affectionate dogs , he also has met problematic dogs , who he says are not pictured in his photo album because he 's too busy avoiding them @entity4 said : ' the dog which jumped into my van was particularly interested in following me			1
' when i got back from deliveries and opened my van door he thought we were doing for a ride			2
' unfortunately we do n't deliver dogs - so i had to kick him out			2
' as if to confirm a widely - held belief , dogs have proved the most problematic animals on his rounds , he said : ' the really mean dogs are n't in the album because i 'm too busy trying to avoid them			2
among animals he has seen during the day include adorable kittens on the front porch of a home no ordinary days for @entity4 from @entity5 who comes across lizards and chickens while out on the job creepy critters like this stick insect are among the unsual encourters that make his delivery job interesting ' i have had trouble with one dog in particular			1
i 've figured out his name is called @entity67 , because i 've heard his owners yelling the name so often			0
' it 's possible they have an unruly kid by that name - but this dog looks like a @entity67			0
' he 's never chained up , and is always on a mission to protect his garden			0
' there is another particularly difficult dog which is chained up , but still in reach of the mailbox			0
' i 'm not too worried about him though - i do n't think he has too many teeth left			0
' @entity4 said one of the dogs that give him trouble ( not pictured ) he is not too worried about because he does not have many teeth left just hanging around - the postman saw in passing a cat relaxing in a bathtub while on his delivery route			1
