but it seems unlikely that the ruling would be changed			0

second look : defense secretary @entity1 says he will reexamine a case involving an @entity4 general who dismissed charges against a lieutenant colonel convicted of sexual assault reversal : lt gen @entity19 ( left ) made the decision to overturn the sexual assault conviction against lt col @entity21 , right , a former inspector general @entity13 's letter is dated march 7 and was sent to @entity33 , @entity34 , who released it publicly			1
the @entity36 is holding a hearing wednesday on sexual assaults in the military and the @entity21 case is expected to be a major topic of discussion			2
@entity33 and @entity33 @entity43 , @entity44 , wrote to @entity13 last week asking him to look into the case			2
they called @entity19 's decision to overturn the jury verdict ' a travesty of justice			0
' @entity19 is commander of the 3rd @entity4 at @entity51 in @entity52			2
@entity33 @entity53 , @entity54 , told @entity4 secretary @entity55 and gen @entity56 , the @entity4 chief of staff , in a march 5 letter that @entity19 's decision ' shows ignorance , at best , and malfeasance , at worst			1
' advocates : @entity33 , left , released the letter from @entity13 on monday , while @entity33 @entity53 , right , has told @entity4 officials that @entity19 's decision ' shows ignorance , at best ' @entity19 's decision undermines efforts by the @entity4 and the other military branches ' to erase a culture that has often turned a blind eye on sexual assault , ' @entity53 added			1
@entity43 and @entity53 are members of the @entity36			0
the @entity4 has been grappling for months with the fallout over a sex scandal at its training headquarters in @entity74			0
dozens of young female recruits and airmen at @entity78 near @entity79 were victimized by their instructors who sexually harassed , improperly touched or raped them			0
during january testimony before a @entity83 , @entity81 likened sexual assault in the @entity4 's ranks to a cancer and vowed to tackle the problem by screening personnel more carefully and putting an end to bad behaviors like binge drinking that can lead to misconduct			1
but @entity81 also acknowledged that the @entity4 recorded a disturbing number of reports of sexual assault last year even as it worked to curb misconduct			1
the preliminary figures for 2012 show there were nearly 800 reports of cases , ranging from inappropriate touching to rape , according to @entity81			1
@entity21 is a former inspector general at @entity22 in @entity23 before he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault , a conviction that was later overturned that would be a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011 , when 614 cases were reported			1
the 2012 figures are being audited and will be included in a report the @entity9 will submit to @entity110 next month			0
in his letter to @entity33 , @entity13 refers to @entity19 as the ' convening authority , ' a term for a commander who is responsible for establishing a court - martial			1
the @entity117 gives a convening authority the ' sole discretion ' to reduce or set aside guilty verdicts and sentences , or to reverse a jury 's verdict			0
@entity21 was convicted on november 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact , aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman			1
the incident involved a civilian employee			0
@entity21 was sentenced to a year in prison and dismissal from the service			0
time for a change : rep @entity138 is looking to propose legislation that would strip commanders of authority to block decisions made by courts - martial but @entity19 exercised his discretion and reviewed the case over a three - week period and concluded ' that the entire body of evidence was insufficient to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt , ' @entity13 wrote			1
although convening authorities are not required to provide reasons for their decisions , @entity13 said he has directed the @entity9 's general counsel and the @entity4 secretary to examine @entity19 's decision ' to determine how the factual basis for the action can be made more transparent			1
' @entity13 also said the @entity21 case raises the question of whether it is necessary or appropriate ' to place the convening authority in the position of having the responsibility to review the findings and sentence of a court - martial , ' particularly when military law allows for a rigorous appeal process			2
he said he is ordering the @entity4 and other military services to examine that question and determine if changes to military law are necessary			0
@entity33 said in a statement that she is encouraged by @entity13 's response			2
' i believe that we should end the ability of senior commanders to unilaterally overturn a decision or sentence by a military court and from the tenor of his letter , i am hopeful that @entity13 will reach the same conclusion , ' @entity33 said			2
rep @entity138 , @entity34 , a member of the @entity190 , said she is planning to introduce legislation on tuesday that would strip commanders of the authority to overturn decision or lessen sentences made by courts - martial			0
@entity196 , who teaches military justice at @entity198 , credited @entity138 for pushing for change , but warned that it could take months to get a bill through @entity110			0
among the thorny issues to be resolved are what , if any , role commanders should have in the administration of military justice and how current law should be adjusted to reflect a shift , he said			0
' no one should be under any illusions that it can be done overnight , ' @entity196 said .			0
