having taken the @entity9 anthem to their hearts in recent years , the noise before the game was sensational , and it was captured in the ground by @entity3 's official @entity23 account			0
unfortunately for the travelling fans , however , the result did not match the support as @entity3 went down 4 - 0 to a rampant @entity28 attack			1
@entity29 opened the scoring after 10 minutes , before @entity31 netted from a corner just a few minutes later			0
@entity33 and @entity34 then added to the scoreline after half time , but it did not dampen the @entity11 fans spirits , who sang right through until the end .			0
