by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 11:07 est , 11 january 2013 sleeping through the night is the milestone that all new mothers hope their baby will reach - and millions of baby books are sold every year promising to deliver it			1
now a hilarious new pastiche entitled ' how to stop @entity7 ' is at least providing some laughs for sleep - deprived parents			1
the blog , imagined from a seven month old ’s perspective , follows the style of manuals which order parents not to sway from their goal of getting their baby to @entity17 ( @entity17 )			1
exhausting : dealing with fractious infants can be a tough gig - especially when you 're getting just a few hours sleep a night but instead it tells babies to stick with their goal of night feeding , urging : ' it 's hard to see your @entity7 upset over your crying			1
just keep reminding yourself , it 's for her own good			1
' the blog imagines what a baby really thinks when at around the six month mark when many mothers are preparing to return to work and start various tactics to train their baby to sleep through			1
it starts : ' ok , here ’s my situation			1
my @entity42 has had me for almost seven months			1
' the first few months were great			1
i cried , she picked me up and fed me , anytime , day or night			1
' over the last few weeks , she has been trying to @entity17 ( sleep through the night )			1
at first , i thought it was just a phase , but it is only getting worse			1
' i ’ve talked to other babies , and it seems like it 's pretty common after mummies have had us for around six months			1
' here ’s the thing : these mummies do n’t really need to sleep			1
it 's just a habit			1
many of them have had some 30 years to sleep and they just do n’t need it anymore			1
so i am implementing a plan			1
' @entity60 ( left ) and actress @entity61 ( right ) will empathise with the plight of other new mothers just as sleep training advocates like @entity66 use cheerleading tactics to buoy on exhausted parents it continues : ' consistency is key ! ! if you let her @entity17 ( sleep through the night ) , just once , she will expect it every night			1
' i know it 's hard ! but she really does n’t need the sleep , she ’s just resisting the change			1
' it also pokes fun at one tactic called ' shhh pat ' - a softer approach from @entity81 a.k.a @entity82 , which is used by parents uncomfortable with controlled crying , and it claims dads are a soft touch			1
' sometimes my @entity42 will call for reinforcements by sending in @entity88			1
' do n’t worry , daddies are not set up for not needing sleep the way mummies are			1
they can only handle a few pats and shhing before they declare defeat and send in the @entity7			1
' the post – which has 50,000 likes on @entity98 has caught the imagination of tens of thousands of mothers , who have exclaimed that the is so accurate that it could have been penned by their own baby			1
the sleep - stopping plan is even given a name – the @entity106			1
no joke : being kept awake by a crying baby for weeks on end is hard - but at least new mothers will be able to smile at the blog one laugh out loud section reads : ' i cried for any reason i could come up with			1
my sleep sack tickled my foot			2
i felt a wrinkle under the sheet			2
my mobile made a shadow on the wall			2
i burped , and it tasted like pears			2
i had n’t eaten pears since lunch , what ’s up with that ? the cat said ' meow '			2
my @entity42 reminds me of this about 20 times a day			2
' once i cried just because i liked how it sounded when it echoed on the monitor in the other room			2
too hot , too cold , just right - does n’t matter ! keep crying ! ! ' i like to give @entity7 false hope that listening to the rain puts me to sleep so sometimes i pretend to close my eyes and be asleep and then wait until i know @entity7 is settling back to sleep to spring a surprise cry attack			1
' if she does n’t get to me fast enough i follow up with my fake cough and gag noise that always has her running to the crib			2
' it took a while , but it worked			2
she fed me at 4am			2
tomorrow night , my goal is 3:30am			2
you need to slowly shorten the interval between feedings in order to reset your @entity42 internal clocks			2
' the post appeared on @entity98 group @entity156 - though this does n't seem to be the original source , and the post has appeared on multiple parenting pages across the globe			1
many readers commented on the post saying they identified with it only too well			1

i call it the @entity106			1
it goes like this : night 1 : cry every three hours until you get fed. i know , its hard			0
its hard to see your mummy upset over your crying			0
just keep reminding yourself , its for her own good			0
night 2 : cry every two hours until you get fed. night 3 : [ @entity205 ] every hour			0
most mummies will start to respond more quickly after about three nights			0
some mummies are more alert , and may resist the change longer			0
these mummies may stand in your doorway for hours , shhhh - ing. do n’t give in			1
i can not stress this enough : @entity214 is key ! ! if you let her @entity17 ( sleep through the night ) , just once , she will expect it every night			0
i know its hard ! but she really does n’t need the sleep , she ’s just resisting the change			0
if you have an especially alert @entity42 , you can stop crying for about 10 minutes , just long enough for her to go back to bed and start to fall asleep			0
my mummy once stayed awake for 10 hours straight , so i know she can do it			1
last night , i cried every hour			0
you just have to decide to stick to it and just go for it			0
