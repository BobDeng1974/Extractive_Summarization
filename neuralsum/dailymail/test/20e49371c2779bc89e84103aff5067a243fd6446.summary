he has well and truly made his name as a legend at the @entity14 , only trailing @entity15 and @entity16 in the club standings			0
@entity1 has scored 300 goals for @entity2 in just six years with the @entity20 giants the @entity7 forward is catching @entity23 ( l ) club record and is just seven goals shy of @entity16 ( r ) @entity1 heads home his 300th goal for the club - against @entity5 at the @entity27 in @entity2 323 - @entity15 308 - @entity16 300 - @entity1 289 - @entity28 242 - @entity29 @entity1 has scored 206 with his right foot , 52 with his left , even managing 41 with his head			1
46 of his goals at @entity2 have been outside the box , many of them screamers			2
after claiming two @entity39 awards during his time in @entity42 , as well as glory in @entity20 and the @entity44 , many would be running out of motivation , scratching around for more records to break			0
but @entity1 , 30 , does n't only have the status of @entity15 or @entity48 to look up to , but also @entity51 rival @entity49 , who is younger , and seemingly still improving			2
but there are other poachers that have formed their goalscoring reputation at one club , including a @entity58 legend and an @entity60 hero who the former @entity62 man could draw inspiration from			0

@entity81 of @entity82 runs with the ball in the @entity97 match against @entity98 in 1978 8 ) @entity49 , @entity51 ( 2004 - present ) 398 * staggeringly , this @entity100 forward is only 27			2
as the star of a mightily impressive @entity103 team , expect @entity49 to climb up this list considerably over the next 10 years			2
@entity49 is closing in on the 400 mark with @entity51 and should rapidly rise up the scoring charts 7 ) @entity107 , @entity108 ( 1971 - 83 and 1985 - 89 ) 401 an attacking midfielder in the top 10 ? often called the ' @entity107 ' , @entity107 encapsulated a fine generation of @entity113 football , and impressed with his club side in his homeland			1

his tally probably proves that			0
@entity136 scored over 500 goals for @entity137 and is up there with @entity141 as a @entity142 great 4 ) @entity152 , @entity153 ( 1922 - 37 ) 522 regarded as the @entity155 ' finest ever player , @entity152 netted 55 hat - tricks for the club and went on to rewrite the football record books with his unbelievable scoring feats			1
