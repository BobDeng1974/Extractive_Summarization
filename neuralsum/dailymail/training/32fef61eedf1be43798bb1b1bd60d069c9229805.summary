as the frogs croaked around us in the utter darkness , all i could think about was whether a moose might turn up beside our circular yurt			1
the wildlife in @entity7 is very big			1
giant animals , huge skies , vast vistas			1
quite a lot of mosquitos			1
colossal camp sites the size of @entity16			1
and , as it happens , very nice people			1
‘ i like @entity7 , ’ announced my son , @entity19 , nine , as we bedded down at @entity22 in @entity23			1
our yurt had everything a camper could desire			1
@entity28 stove , can of propane , pile of wood , interlocking saucepans , box of cocoa			1
a very near - at - hand beauty : @entity23 is @entity7 at its prettiest , and is only six hours away @entity7 ’s @entity37 have ventured into ‘ ready - to - camp ’ accommodation , as @entity19 and i discovered during our week in the easternmost provinces , the @entity43			1
our first campsite was on the banks of the @entity46			1
the @entity47 one , that is , which was bursting with long reeds , sparkling water , kingfishers , herons and lots of frogs			2
meanwhile , on dry land , flying squirrels and chipmunks skipped about and chattered			1
mosquito coils , an outdoor ‘ privy ’ and a large spider gave us the requisite thrill of being hardily brave , @entity62 - style ; the yurt ’s mattresses and its lockable door were reassuring touches of home			2
we played cards and read stories			2
once the sun went down , we were out of our comfort zone			2
but that was the point : the shared thrill of the darkness			2
next morning was heaven : fresh coffee , grapefruit , maple - smoked bacon and eggs			2
could things get any better ? actually , they did , in the form of the improbably named @entity83 , an official guide who took us for a canoe trip			2
@entity83 looked like a close relation of @entity89 - but with a pen - knife			2
both @entity19 and i thought he was perfect			2
as he manfully ( sorry , but it was so ) powered our canoe across the water , teaching us how to paddle , and pointing out the eerie cry of the @entity99 bird , he explained that even the @entity100 had realised @entity7 was an ideal ‘ getting away from it all ’ spot			2
and here 's where we put down roots : @entity19 checks out the standard of accommodation in @entity23 is it a yurt or is it a home ? @entity110 found that the standard of ' tented ' accommodation was very high and us @entity112 ? well , as the @entity43 are only six hours ’ flight away ( @entity116 to @entity117 ) , with only four hours ’ time difference , the journey is easy			1
we hammered 300 miles north - westwards to @entity119			0
here , we luxuriated in an otentik , a wooden and canvas structure , which was extremely comfortable			0
we went on the @entity122			0
did the bears turn up ? @entity124			1
we gazed on half a dozen of them from the safety of a tall tower			0
there were even several babies			0
@entity119 is almost wholly @entity131 and is crazy about lobster			0
en route to the next site , we sailed out onto the @entity135 and learned how to identify , catch and , yes , eat them			0
@entity19 , meanwhile , plumped for grilled chicken			0
was @entity7 all he had expected ? ‘ it ’s a bit			0
big , ’ he said , cautiously , as we motored down yet another long , straight road bounded by around 10,000 @entity141 firs			0
yet the calm of the journey gave us time to sing , talk about football , play @entity146 and generally relax			1
after a terrifying , but exhilarating , zipwire experience , diving 60ft off a tower at @entity151 , our final destination was @entity152 , on the steep banks of the giant @entity154			0
@entity89 with a pen - knife : @entity19 receives canoeing instruction from the improbably named @entity83 a good holiday thoroughly enjoyed : @entity110 and @entity19 returned from @entity7 full of smiles here , we stayed in a simple but well - equipped tent			0
and here was the most magical moment of all			0
led by a park guide , @entity19 and i ( and about 80 other people ) quietly walked around a big pond in the gathering dusk			0
we saw gnawed - through logs , the beaver ’s dam , and learned about how these extraordinary creatures live			0
just as it was getting dark , there it was , a little , whiskered face paddling swiftly towards us through the clear water			0
he dived in , showing off his glossy fur and huge wide tail , then popped up again			0
yes , it was a beaver ; the symbol of the @entity181 , personally welcoming us to this giant , calm country of abundant wildlife , empty roads and a beguiling air of freedom and tranquillity			0
@entity190 ( www.aircanada.com ) flies to @entity117 from £ 730 return			1
one week ’s car hire from @entity117 with @entity193 ( www.thrifty.com ) starts at £ 188			1
a yurt at @entity22 ( 001 902 682 - 2772 ) , @entity23 , costs from £ 38 per night			1
six - man tents with a stove at @entity198 ( 001 506 - 887 - 6000 ) in @entity152 cost from £ 64 per night , and at @entity200 ( 001 506 - 876 - 2443 ) , from £ 48 per night			0

@entity203 is just six hours ' flying time from @entity116 ( to @entity117 )
@entity23 is a wild and *wonderful* *enclave* for a family camping break
@entity207 encountered bears and beavers on a break with her *young* son
