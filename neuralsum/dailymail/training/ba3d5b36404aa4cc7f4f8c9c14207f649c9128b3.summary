one in five of the households receives @entity8 while more than one in 10 is paid income support			0
however the total amount of money the large families can receive is now being limited to £ 26,000 , as ministers come under pressure to cut the benefits cap by as much as a third			1
welfare : new figures reveal the raft of benefits claimed by families with five or more children new figures reveal that in may 2012 there were 66,580 families with five or more children receiving out - of - work benefits			1
of these , 13,670 were paid @entity8 , 7,900 received @entity25 or @entity26 and 41,580 were paid @entity27 , received by people working fewer than 16 hours a week			0
some 9,110 households also received @entity30 while @entity31 was also paid to 600 homes			0
some households will receive more than one of these benefits			0
figures released last week show that almost 10,000 families with five or more children had been hit by the £ 26,000 benefit cap			1
work and pensions secretary @entity41 said : ‘ capping benefit at average earnings is forecast , by reducing the large benefit amounts previously paid to households , to save £ 85 million this year and around £ 140 million next year			1
work and pensions secretary @entity41 said three in four people back the benefits cap ‘ what is more , some 19,000 potentially capped claimants have moved into work , where paying tax and national insurance contributions brings a further benefit to the exchequer			1
’ the cap affects income from the main out - of - work benefits including @entity8 , @entity57 , @entity58 and other benefits such as @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 and @entity63			2
however , households are exempt from the cap if someone living their receives one of a number of other benefits such as @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and the @entity73			2
mr @entity41 came under pressure yesterday from @entity76 mps to cut the benefit cap from £ 26,000 to as little as £ 18,000			1
in the @entity78 he insisted the policy is ‘ under review ’ and is backed by three in four members of the public			0
the coalition ’s decision to cap the total amount of income a family can receive in benefits has proved to be one of the most popular policies ever devised			2
the government set the maximum amount that a household can receive in benefits at £ 26,000 – the median average annual income of a working family			1
it means couples , with or without children , can claim up to £ 500 - a - week while a single adult without children can receive £ 350 - a - week in benefits			2
but many @entity76 mps have argued it is still equivalent to the take - home pay of someone earning £ 35,000			0
@entity107 : ministers hope that capping benefits will persuade thousands of people to find work instead @entity76 mp @entity112 complained it was much higher than the median average £ 22,130 annual salary in his @entity116 constituency , giving most workers take home pay of only £ 17,800			0
last week it emerged that since the cap ’s introduction in april last year , 33,000 families had had their benefits curbed			1
it included 150 who received more than the take - home pay of someone on a salary of £ 65,000 - a - year			0
in the @entity78 mr @entity112 said his constituents were astonished by the figures			0
he urged mr @entity41 to ‘ persevere with this policy of a benefits cap and also review the level at which the cap , which is currently considerably more than the average post tax income in my constituency ’			1
reducing the cap to £ 20,000 would be the equivalent to take home pay of someone in work on a salary of around £ 25,000 .			0
