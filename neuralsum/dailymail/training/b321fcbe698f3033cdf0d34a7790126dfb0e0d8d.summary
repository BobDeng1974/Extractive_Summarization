a boy with a rare medical condition that renders him unable to smile is being adopted by the kind - hearted nurse who cared for him in hospital			1
three - year - old @entity5 suffers from @entity6 - a life - limiting disease which has left him severely disabled and unable to make facial expressions			1
doctors said he would not live past a year old , and though he has proved them wrong , there is no cure for the condition , meaning his muscles will slowly degenerate and his condition will deteriorate			1
@entity5 inherited the disease from his mother , whose disabilities meant she could n't look after her son			1
attempts to find foster parents had failed , and social workers had almost reached the point of despair , wondering how they were going to take care of him			1
but just as it looked as though all hope was lost , the nurse who cared for him in hospital came forward , making the brave decision to adopt him and take him home			1
@entity31 , three , spent the first five months of his life in hospital as his mother 's disabilities meant she could n't care for him			1
he is being adopted by @entity36 , 51 , the paediatric nurse who cared for him @entity5 has @entity38 - a life limiting disease causes muscle wastage and degeneration - and is severely disabled @entity36 , 51 , said she could n't bear seeing him without a home			1
since she became @entity5 's guardian , the mother - of - six has battled endlessly trying to find a cure for his condition			1
after spending all of her spare time carrying out research , her hard work has won him a place on the world 's first clinical trial in @entity53 , where scientists may have found a drug that could potentially cure his condition			1
mrs @entity36 , who is in the process of adopting @entity5 , said : ' he was my patient and was born on the maternity wing at @entity60 ( @entity60 )			1
' when he came off the wing he went to the medical ward at 10 weeks old			0
he never went anywhere and his address was the hospital			2
' after about six days i knew i wanted to take care of him			2
they were struggling to get foster carers for him and i could n't watch it anymore			1
' i went into his cubicle and looked at him			0
the social worker said " i do n't know what we 're going to do "			2
' i said " i do , i 'll take him "			0
' she started crying and told her manager straight away			0
' @entity5 's condition means he is unable to smile or make other facial conditions			1
he also has severe learning difficulties			0
however he has defied original predictions that he would only live for a year @entity6 is the early childhood form of myotonic dystrophy - and the symptoms are evident from birth			1
the rare condition , which can cause breathing difficulties for the baby shortly after delivery , can be seen if the baby appears to be ' floppy ' , has poor head control and lack of facial expression			1
babies with the condition may also suffer from speech difficulties , and physical and intellectual milestones in the baby 's development may be delayed			2
the disease is a genetic condition that progressively weakens and wastes the muscles			1
the impact of the degeneration varies significantly ; some people may only find it difficult to carry out day - to - day tasks while others will have a seriously shortened life expectancy because of the condition			1
mrs @entity36 , who has been a paediatric nurse for 32 years , decided to find @entity5 all the medical help possible and , with husband @entity109 , 43 , a civil engineer , began caring for him			1
before mrs @entity36 agreed to adopt @entity5 , repeated attempts to find foster carers had failed			1
now she says her whole family has fallen in love with him @entity6 is the early childhood form of myotonic dystrophy , and the symptoms are evident from birth			1
the rare condition , which can cause breathing difficulties for the baby shortly after delivery , can be seen if the baby appears to be ' floppy ' , have poor head control and lack of facial expression			1
babies with the condition may also suffer from speech difficulties , and physical and intellectual milestones in the baby 's development may be delayed			2
the disease is a genetic condition that progressively weakens and wastes the muscles			1
roughly 70,000 people in @entity135 carry the genes responsible for triggering muscular dystrophy			0
however , many are unaware they are ‘ carriers ’ of the disease where a gene spontaneously changes			0
the affected muscle fibres degenerate and are slowly replaced with fatty tissue			2
the impact of the degeneration varies significantly ; some people may only find it difficult to carry out day - to - day tasks while others will have a seriously shortened life expectancy because of the condition			1
sadly , congenital myotonic dystrophy can be fatal , especially in the early weeks of life			0
there is no cure or treatment			2
source : @entity158 she said : ' @entity5 had a feeding tube and club feet and they needed somebody with medical knowledge to take care of him			1
' it was the right place at the right time			0
it was a split second decision			0
' i came home and explained to my three grown - up children there was a little boy at work who the social workers were struggling to find a home for			2
they said " why do n't you bring him here ? " and i said " it 's funny you should say that "			2
' two weeks later he was moved in			0
i never thought of doing this			0
until that day i was working full time			0
' medical specialists were shocked that i brought him home - and i will always be known as that nurse who brought the baby home			2
' it 's been difficult - and at times it 's been heart - breaking			0
' but we have all fallen in love with him			0
it 's a nasty , progressive , awful condition			2
it is one of the worst conditions that i have come across			0
' mrs @entity36 , who now works as a children 's community nurse after leaving @entity60 in november 2014 , worked 24 hours a day researching and asking doctors for help in trying to find a cure for @entity5			1
finally , she discovered researchers at @entity203 were looking for 65 children from around the world to take part in the very first clinical programme to develop a new drug for children with @entity210			1
after endless emails , she got an reply back saying they would be happy for @entity5 to take part			1
he is the only child in the @entity135 to take part in this programme , and the family hope it will one day lead to a cure			2
mrs @entity36 has carried out endless research , and eventually enrolled @entity5 on to a clinical trial in @entity53			1
a drugs company is testing an injection she hopes will cure @entity5 's condition mrs @entity36 said : ' we are consumed with helping him			1
it 's funny how dependent on @entity229 i am now			0
' he is a very happy little boy			0
he loves @entity230 and he is a total joy			0
' but he is weak and he ca n't walk very far			2
one of the most difficult things for him is that it affects his facial expression			0
' for him that 's difficult because people think there is nobody home			0
' people tend to talk over him and it 's just because he ca n't make an expression			2
we have also got to be careful when he eats			0
' doctors did not think @entity5 would live past a year , but on his third birthday he got up and walked			1
mrs @entity36 said : ' it was a miracle in itself			1
when this came up in @entity53 i knew i needed to find out how to save him			2
' i found out they were asking for children with the condition to attend the trials in @entity251 and i started emailing to make sure @entity229 was accepted			0
' it 's very costly and we have done it all through fundraising			0
' mrs @entity36 has raised £ 2,000 in fundraising money to take @entity5 to @entity53 for the clinical trials			1
over the next two years experts will monitor how his muscles are faili @entity5 's situation has already sparked donations towards the @entity53 trips , and so far mrs @entity36 has raised £ 2,000			1
she said : ' the donations have given us a chance to try and save his life			0
the money will get him back to @entity53			0
' everything is a battle with @entity229			0
as harsh as it sounds , in terms of the government , he is not going to give anything back to society			0
' mrs @entity36 took @entity5 for his first trip to @entity53 for the clinical trial on november 9th last year			1
she said : ' @entity5 had a body scan , @entity277 of his heart , stamina test and blood and intellectual tests			2
we will go out again in october for the same tests and again the year after			0
' the @entity53 drugs company is waiting for the data in the hope that they can find a drug			2
' they have got the adult form of the drug and have started clinical trials for the child form			2
' the drug will be in injection form - and the hope is it will stop the disease			0
' when we are born , we have protein that is sent to muscles all over the body			0
' @entity229 has a toxin that stops that protein spreading and it stays like a dough ball			0
' the drug will split the protein and send it to the parts of the body that needs it			0
' mrs @entity36 and husband , said @entity5 will visit @entity251 a further two times over the next two years where experts will monitor how his muscles are failing			1
she added : ' he does have some words but his mouth muscles are very weak and his tongue muscles are too			0
' the way he is going he is improving but he will start to deteriorate			0
' when we came back from @entity53 i felt like we had hope where there was previously none			0

@entity31 inherited @entity6 from his mother

rare condition means he can not smile and his muscles will degenerate
after five months , repeated attempts to find foster carers had failed
@entity36 , 51 , the nurse who cared for @entity5 agreed to adopt him
has now enrolled him in a clinical trial of a drug she hopes will cure him
