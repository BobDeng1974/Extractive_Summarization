it might sound , well , a bit bananas , but making your bread and cakes with green banana flour could be a healthier way to satisfy your carb cravings			1
the flour – which does not actually taste of bananas – contains resistant starch , a type of carbohydrate which behaves like fibre by helping to control blood sugar levels and keeping us fuller for longer			1
and because resistant starch can not be completely absorbed by the body , we take fewer calories from it			2
@entity37 , whose company @entity24 sources the ingredient from unripened bananas grown in @entity26 , said : ‘ we only started selling it last month , but so far sales are doubling each week			0
’ ‘ at £ 10 for a 400g packet it ’s more expensive than your average self - raising , but you do n’t need as much of it			0
‘ you use about 25 per cent less than normal wheat flour when baking			0
‘ taste-wise it has a slightly nutty , clean flavour , but it is almost flavourless			0
it can also be added into smoothies and salad dressings			0
’ @entity57 , consultant dietitian and senior lecturer at @entity59 , said banana flour could also help those who needed a high - fibre diet			2
the flour – which does not actually taste of bananas – contains resistant starch , a type of carbohydrate which behaves like fibre by helping to control blood sugar levels and keeping us fuller for longer ( file picture ) gluten - free , and with a subtle nutty flavour , the banana flour can be substituted for ordinary wheat flour in nearly every recipe , converts claim			1
ordinary starch , found in regular bread , potatoes and pasta , is rapidly digested in the small intestine and absorbed as glucose into the blood			0
but not all resistant starch is absorbed by the small intestine , so sugar is released into the blood more slowly , and insulin levels do n’t rise as quickly			1
this prevents a subsequent drop in blood sugar levels - which makes us feel hungry			1
@entity57 , consultant dietitian and senior lecturer at @entity59 , said : ‘ the resistant starch in green bananas slows the release of food through the gut which helps slow the insulin response			2
‘ this will have a knock - on effect on weight management by controlling blood sugar levels throughout the day			1
‘ it can help some types of @entity105 sufferers as well – those who need a high fibre diet			0
