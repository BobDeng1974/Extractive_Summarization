two singles in their seventies who married after a chance meeting at a blues concert have proved that love can come at any age			1
@entity7 , a 70 - year - old travel writer who lives in @entity8 , had been divorced twice and no longer had marriage on her mind when she met @entity11 , a 71 - year - old retired insurance executive , at the @entity12 , a theater on @entity15 's @entity14 , in july 2012			1
' i had completely decided that it absolutely was not worth it			2
i 'd done it twice and that was enough , ' ms @entity7 told @entity21			1
just married : @entity7 , a 70 - year - old travel writer who lives in @entity8 , wed @entity11 , 71 , on december 13 after meeting at a blues show in 2012 ' i was very happy with my life as it was			1
i was living a life as a complete person with a lot of friends			2
and i did n't feel i had to have a man			0
i think if you get to a certain age , you get over that - you do n't need to have a man in your life , ' she added			2
she and mr @entity11 , who had also been divorced twice and has three grown children , struck up a conversation about their mutual love of the blues after he noticed that her friend was wearing a shirt from the @entity42 in @entity43 , where mr @entity11 had stayed many times			1
' i thought he was absolutely charming and i loved his @entity46 accent , ' she recalled of mr @entity11 , who grew up in @entity47 , @entity48 , and now produces blues bands			1
' i was thrilled to meet someone who had a similar passion			0
' one day later , he invited her to @entity54 , a music festival near his home in @entity57 , @entity58			0
the following weekend , he asked her to take a ride on his motorcycle			1
' the moment he told me he loved motorcyles , i thought oh @entity63 , he 's got to have tattoos all over his body			2
he 's probably got black leather , he 's got chains and he rides a @entity68			2
but i liked him enough to be willing to give it a go , ' she said			0
first impression : ' i thought he was absolutely charming and i loved his @entity46 accent , ' ms @entity7 recalled of mr @entity11 however , she found the ride exhilarating , telling the @entity76 : ' riding behind him was very sensual			1
you can choose how much to put your arms around him			0
i put my arms around him a lot			0
we were like two teenagers on our first date			2
by the time we made it back to the city , i was hooked			0
' the pair went on to experience other adventures together , including a motorcycle ride in the rain on @entity92 's @entity91 , during which they got lost , not speaking a word of @entity95 , and ended up in @entity96			1
it was in @entity95 that ms @entity7 began to realize the relationship was serious , she added to @entity21			1
' it was the first time i 'd been away with him for more than two or three nights and he was really easy to be with and we had the same values			0
and i was very attracted to him , which i had n't been in a very long time			0
i had just met a lot of men whom i could n't wait to get away from after a cup of coffee , ' she said			0
on a subsequent trip to @entity113 , where ms @entity7 was working on a story assignment , mr. @entity11 proposed in @entity116 , telling her : ' i will love you forever			1
please be a part of my life			0
' the couple married on december 13 at mr. @entity11 â€™s church , @entity121 in @entity57			1
happy couple : ' he was really easy to be with and we had the same values , ' ms @entity7 said of mr @entity11 ms @entity7 said she was eager to gain 13 new family members , including mr @entity11 's son and two daughters , and their spouses and children			1
she found an instant rapport with his daughter @entity131 , whom she met on their first date at @entity54 , and was impressed that all three children were ' so beautifully brought up , and so polite '			2
ms @entity7 said that there are two secrets to a happy marriage			1
' first of all , respecting the other one 's feelings and compromising instead of blowing up or getting resentful			2
but even before that , being open about your feelings , ' she said			0
' in both other marriages , i just let the resentment seethe inside of me			0
i was too afraid to express what i really felt because i thought each respective husband would get angry			0
but now that i 'm older and wiser , i have no trouble telling @entity11 if something bothers me and he does the same			1
i think the resentments are what drive people to divorce			0
it 's empowering to be able to say what you feel			2
' ms @entity7 has kept her apartment in @entity8 , where she likes to write in her office , while mr @entity11 will maintain his residence in @entity160 , @entity58 , where he 's since moved , so that neither has to compromise their lifestyle			1
the couple will spend weekends together and plan dinner dates during the week			0
ms @entity7 said : ' i think at 20 , or 30 , or 40 , as a woman , you 're looking for someone to complete you			1
even the second time around , you kind of lose your identity to a man			0
if you were brought up in an age when your mother said find a guy , marry him and darn his socks and cook his meals , you become an appendage of your husband and you lose whatever identity is your own			0
' but when you 're 70 , if you choose to get married , you have your identity , you 're not about to lose it			1
and if you 're marrying someone who 's also 70 , then they understand that			2
they 're not going to try to mold you into something they want you to be			0
