for the @entity4 , there was a first start of the campaign for winger @entity25 , 10 months on from knee surgery , with @entity27 stepping aside			2

but the under - strength @entity10 were still fastest out of the blocks , @entity43 's long pass cutting out the @entity45 defence and allowing @entity46 to romp home inside two minutes			1
just four minutes later they had a second score , @entity43 again the provider , keeping the ball alive for @entity49 to crash over			0
the @entity4 were offering precious little in attack , but @entity10 had no such worries , @entity56 running in a third try on 12 minutes after strong work from @entity46			1

there was still time for the porous @entity45 defence to concede a further try before the interval , @entity81 racing over after bouncing off a series of tackles			0
it was more of the same after the break , @entity86 's break giving @entity56 a clear run to the line to open up a 30 - 8 @entity10 lead on 44 minutes			1
@entity25 did give @entity45 fans a glimpse of just what they have missed this season when he raced in at the corner after an excellent @entity62 offload			0
and , just as in the first half , the @entity4 struck again quickly , @entity98 easing over from a @entity99 pass to reduce the arrears to 30 - 20			1
but , also as in the first half , @entity10 righted their wrongs almost instantly , @entity102 muscling over for his second score on 55 minutes			2
the tries kept coming , @entity45 claiming their fifth with 20 minutes to play when @entity99 rounded off excellent work from @entity98 and @entity107			0
and a grandstand finish was on the cards when @entity11 burrowed over for his second try on 70 minutes , cutting the deficit to 36 - 32			0
