by @entity0 the @entity2 ’s chief cricket commentator has revealed how he offered to take his wife ’s terminally ill former husband abroad to an assisted suicide clinic			1
test match special presenter @entity6 said he would accompany @entity7 to @entity8 in @entity9 after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease			1
mr @entity6 , 53 , said assisted suicide was an ‘ extremely sensitive and complex ’ moral issue but believed individuals should be able to choose to die if they wanted			2
life or death decision : @entity6 , 52 , with his wife whose former husband @entity7 was seriously ill. mr @entity6 offered to accompany him to the @entity8 in @entity9 ‘ it was a very short conversation with @entity7 , ’ he said			1
‘ he just gave me a look and a nod of appreciation that i had made the offer			0
@entity6 with second wife @entity25			2
he offered to accompany her ex- husband to the @entity8 clinic in @entity9 ‘ i did it because i wanted to give him the choice and because i hope that one day , if i am ever in that situation , somebody will make the same offer to me			1
‘ no pressure , just knowing the possibility is there if i wanted it			0
’ mr @entity6 had enjoyed a good relationship with @entity38 solicitor mr @entity7 , who lost his two - year battle with motor neurone disease in december 2005			1
the commentator ’s second wife @entity25 had two children with mr @entity7 – @entity44 , 23 , and 19 - year - old @entity45			1
but the youngsters were able to remain close to their father thanks to efforts by the @entity49 to include mr @entity7 in regular sunday lunches and even family holidays			1
mr @entity6 said his wife , a @entity2 journalist he married in 1996 , may not have known about his conversation about assisted suicide with her former husband , but he believed she would have ‘ felt the same way ’ about it			1
the former @entity59 and @entity60 cricketer added : ‘ i have no idea how i would respond			0
‘ like anyone , while i am fit and healthy i will fight to my last breath for life			0
but if i was suffering with a terminal illness , who knows how i would feel or what i would want ? ‘ it ’s something that is unimaginable until it happens to you and that is why i believe it has to be for that individual to decide what he or she wants to do			0
‘ if someone you love and care about , and who is clearly ill and suffering as @entity7 was , and he knew it was only going to get worse , i felt it was the right thing that he at least knew i would help him			1
' it ’s so hard for people who have to frame legislation and make laws on this subject			0
‘ but until you ’re in that situation yourself i think your views are irrelevant			0
’ more than 200 @entity89 have died at @entity8 since it was set up in 1998			2
the cricket commentator said he had good relationship with mr @entity7 who died in december 2005 after a two - year battle with motor neurone disease under guidelines issued by the @entity99 in 2010 , a person accompanying someone abroad to commit assisted suicide is unlikely to face the courts			1
but the guidance says a prosecution is ‘ more likely to be required ’ if the victim lacked the capacity ‘ to reach an informed decision to commit suicide ’			0
in deciding whether to take action , police must investigate whether a person was able to give their consent			0
