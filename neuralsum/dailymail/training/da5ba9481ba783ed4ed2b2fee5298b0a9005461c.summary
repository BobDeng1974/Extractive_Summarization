' the mother , who has a daughter , four , and 18 - month - old son , immediately contacted police to report the crime and canceled her credit cards			0
however because mrs @entity8 had not seen anyone actually stick their hand in her bag to take the belongings , police listed the phone as ' lost ' and not stolen			1
