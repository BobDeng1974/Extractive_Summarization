@entity1 tourists are today warned to beware migrants trying to stow away in their cars or caravans amid a ‘ crisis ’ at @entity6			1
an investigation by @entity8 found illegal immigrants heading for @entity1 are making it across the entire @entity11 without a single border check			1
ahead of the @entity15 getaway , the situation has become so severe lorries are being told not to stop within 125 miles of the port for fear of people trying to clamber aboard			0
@entity8 say that , as a result of greater lorry security , cars and motor homes are a prime target			1
the committee found evidence of migrants who arrived in the @entity11 via @entity44 or @entity45 making their way to @entity6 without ‘ encountering any border controls ’			1
its report , titled ‘ migration failures lead to a crisis in @entity6 ’ , blamed the @entity51 allowing @entity11 citizens to travel from one member state to another without passport checks			1
the @entity1 opts out of the agreement , which @entity57 refused to sign 30 years ago to sneers from fellow @entity60 leaders			1
but even the @entity62 authorities have now declared @entity51 a ‘ failure ’			0
@entity64 allowing access to the @entity11 are not being properly policed , allowing tens of thousands of people from the likes of @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 to flood in via @entity45 , @entity72 and @entity44			2
retired bank manager @entity73 , 59			0
came through the @entity74 without realising there was a stowaway illegal immigrant in the back of her car @entity79 , the executive director of @entity60 border agency @entity80 , has warned that @entity81 alone has up to a million potential migrants ready to leave for the @entity11			1
the number massed at @entity6 has almost doubled since september from 1,300 to 2,500			2
sir @entity84 , director - general of the @entity86 ’s @entity85 , said staff detected 30,180 attempts to enter the @entity1 in the ten months to the end of january			2
this compared to 18,000 in the entire preceding year			2
yet when caught , the migrants were handed over to the @entity62 who simply let them go			0
the mps say : ‘ we find it bizarre that there are thousands of attempts to enter the @entity1 illegally through @entity6 , at great cost and inconvenience to business and leisure travellers , transport companies , and hauliers , and yet the people who are caught are simply released back into the @entity62 countryside			1
’ the government is helping to fund more security fences around @entity6			1
when she found an illegal immigrant hiding in the back seat of her @entity109 after driving home from @entity62 , @entity73 could n’t believe her eyes			0
miss @entity73 thinks the man sneaked into her car when she left it briefly unlocked at @entity6 in september last year			2
discovering him upon arrival in @entity117 , miss @entity73 told the man ‘ in no uncertain terms ’ to ‘ get lost ’			0
she said at the time : ‘ i ’ve got a @entity109 for goodness sake , with two dogs in the back			0
' and i ’ve managed to get though passport control and everything else with a stowaway on board			0
’ but the report says there are fears that as security around freight traffic increases , migrants ‘ will adapt to hiding in a wider variety of vehicles , including private cars or caravans ’			2
the home affairs committee warns : ‘ @entity51 was intended to allow free movement , but not the free movement of illegal migrants			0
it was based on the assumption that the external border would be secure			0
’ committee chairman @entity145 said : ‘ the crisis in @entity6 is a direct result of the soft @entity11 external border in the @entity149 and the @entity72 - @entity44 border			1
’ the mps also cast doubt on the @entity86 ’s ability to carry out new exit checks on everybody leaving the country from april 8			0
ferry operators have warned the measure could create travel chaos for passengers and long queues			0
the @entity8 said they expected ministers to agree a series of exemptions – such as not checking the passports of @entity1 tourists leaving by coach			1
a @entity86 spokesman said it had committed £ 12million to help reinforce security at @entity6 , ‘ including installing security fencing and improving the flow of traffic to reduce the risk of queuing vehicles being targeted by migrants ’ .			1

immigrants make it across the entire @entity11 without a single border check
*due* to *heightened* lorry security , many try to stow away in cars
@entity1 tourists are being warned they might be targeted in @entity6
