by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:44 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:05 est , 22 december 2013 a dinner of roadkill , a full @entity7 spread salvaged from dustbins , and a side order of sprouts that are a year old - some people will go to no limits to cut @entity7 costs , it seems			1
@entity15 student @entity14 rooted around supermarket skips and rubbish dumps to find all the components of a heaving @entity7 spread - from duck and roast potatoes , carrots and parsnips , to the cheese course and mulled wine and beer			1
if you think that 's extreme , try @entity29 , the 46 - year - old from @entity30 , @entity31 , who has dined exclusively on roadkill for the past 30 years , and has a trio of fox , pheasant and venison planned for his table on christmas day			1
and for a different type of ' foraged food ' - and those who ca n't face the faff of cooking at @entity7 - a takeaway service is offering a range of festive dinners , including a mince pie pizza , ' @entity7 ' sushi and a kebab served with lashings of bread sauce			1
art student @entity14 has been living as a ' freegan ' for a year - someone who gets all their food and household items from dustbins			1
miss @entity14 said : ' @entity7 , i was n't " bin - diving " and i must have paid over Â £ 100 on presents and other things			1
' this year , i 've only spent Â £ 20 altogether because i 've been able to get so much from bins			0
' i do n't spend a penny on food either			0
my whole @entity7 dinner has come from a skip			1
even the microwave we use was discovered in a bin			0
' reject roast : @entity94 quiches , pork pies , fruit salad and cheese were just some of the things that went into miss @entity14 's freegan meal - along with beer that was literally bin - end dumpster dive : miss @entity14 and her friends scavenge in a skip for more @entity7 goodies waste : @entity106 throw away 249 , 650 tonnes over the @entity7 season miss @entity14 has already served up a freegan feast for her housemates @entity48 , 25 , and @entity46 , 23			1
along with her duck dinner plus trimmings , she was able to give offer them mince pies , mini quiches , trifle , pork pies and fruit salad			0
the house was decorated with a rubbish bin christmas tree , lights and baubles - all of them sourced from high street and charity shop skips , as were her @entity7 presents , which she wrapped in dustbin wrapping paper			2
every year , @entity127 people throw out 249,650 tonnes of waste over @entity7			2
miss @entity14 said , ' i go binning for the obvious reason of not paying for stuff but mostly , i just hate seeing food and other things wasted			0
' the waste during the holidays is terrible			0
it 's senseless throwing @entity7 cards and food away before the day even arrives			1
' tuck in : @entity14 is proud of her freegan lifestyle , which she says she has followed for about a year share and enjoy : the art student managed to dig out so many @entity7 goodies that she was able to set up a @entity144 website to donate them to friends @entity29 shares miss @entity14 's horror at @entity7 waste , and it 's what he says led him to his penchant for roadkill			1
the taxidermist and wildlife consultant says that packing his car boot full of squashed animals he finds on country lanes has saved him thousands of pounds , and that his @entity7 dinner will cost around 50p a portion			1
he said : ' the meat is rarely dry and there 's no wastage - i eat what i can			0
' street food : @entity29 picks up , skins , prepares ... and eats his own roadkill @entity169 's appetite : mr @entity29 takes a bite from the freshly - run - over meat ( with veg on the side ) write caption here he described fox as tasting ' a bit porky ' , the un-hung venison as ' fresh ' and the pheasant as ' very fresh too , which tastes a bit like turkey anyway			1
his unusual meat dish will be served along with vegetables including mushrooms he picked himself			0
mr @entity29 's freezer is jam packed with a variety of critters yet to be skinned and filleted			0
he said : ' i think more people should eat roadkill - obviously it 's not something that 's sustainable for everyone to do and i know most people might not want to do it			2
' but i would seriously encourage more people to pick up dead animals off the road rather than see them wasted , or at least throw them off the road so other animals or people can pick them up			0
' and if all that meat is a little too much , never fear - there 's a leftover veg option too , courtesy of @entity58 from @entity208 near @entity209			0
preserved : @entity58 offers up a dish of last - year 's sprouts ms @entity208 found a dish of last year 's @entity55 sprouts as she prepared for @entity7 and discovered they were perfectly preserved - though only after some struggle to pen the lid , which had been sealed shut by the gases emitted by the vegetables inside			1
it turned out that her father had washed up on @entity221 and assumed he had already cleaned the dish , so put it back in the cupboard - complete with its contents			0
@entity225 ms @entity208 said she and her father thought they still looked good enough to eat - but did n't test them just to be on the safe side			1
but if the thought of sourcing your own food from the side of the road , a bin or the back of a cupboard is just too much , one takeaway service is offering festive versions of classic fast food to order on 25 december			2
special delivery : pizza , a kebab , sushi and curry make up the four festive offerings from just eat this year ( roaring fire not included ) just eat 's @entity7 range includes pork and stuffing sushi , mince pie pizza and turkey stuffing kebab with bread sauce			1
the 10 - inch mince pie pizza is made from 350g mince meat , edible gold stars and icing sugar			0
the kebab contains 500g of turkey thigh mince , chestnut stuffing , cranberry relish in a pitta bread with bacon , lettuce and bread sauce creates the festive kebab			0
chipolatas and bacon are used to make the sushi , which is wrapped in cavolo nero , while 100g of brussels sprouts are used in the spicy curry			2
the dishes were designed based on responses to a poll on the @entity144 page of the food ordering service , which asked members of the public to name their fantasy festive takeaway			2
new research shows more than 8,500 takeaway orders were made on christmas day last year , with over 500,000 orders made between december 23 and 31			0
almost half of orders were for pizza , a third were for @entity285 and 8 per cent were for fried chicken and chips			0
four in 10 @entity106 plan to order a takeaway during the holiday period this year , the study from just eat found .			2
