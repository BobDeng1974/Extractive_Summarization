' the 40 - year - old then deleted the tweet , and wrote : ' i 'm sorry if i offended @entity56 ' changing her mind : the @entity4 tweeted that @entity3 was the 1st lady of girl power , but removed the tweet after receiving criticism apology : @entity0 was quick to delete the post and apologised to fans explaining her decision she wrote today : ' i was so confused and overwhelmed by some of the feedback i received that i took my tweet down and for that i was called spineless			1
' i realised the best thing to do was to shut up and really get honest with myself			0
what i hated the most was that i took a tweet down			0
i had wavered and was full of self - doubt			0
' i suddenly thought given the adverse reaction , did i even really know enough about @entity3 ? was i just trying to be relevant ? she had obviously upset a lot of people			2
' @entity0 has involved herself in politics ever since her rise to fame			2
before @entity79 swept to power in 1997 she said : ' i saw a lot of what @entity3 did			1
she was definitely the original @entity4 rising from the greengrocer 's daughter to prime minister			1
' a year earlier she said @entity79 was ' not a safe pair of hands for the economy '			0
@entity89 and presenter @entity90 later called her ' @entity92 scum ' , but the @entity4 maintained that @entity3 was an inspiration			1
but in 2001 she switched to @entity94 and even appeared in one of the party 's election broadcasts			0
weak under fire ( please forgive grammar & spelling ! ) when i ’m scared , my natural state is to hide and run for cover			0
i was 7 years old when my father told me about the greengrocer ’s daughter who had become the first female prime minister in our history			1
i was enchanted by this … my father who was always hiding behind the broadsheets spoke about her my whole childhood			0
fast forward to 1996 … it was widely covered in the media , when i casually mentioned that i admired @entity3 in an interview for a political magazine			1
monday 8th april 2013 – @entity3 had died … i felt compelled to tweet my thoughts for a female leader , in a world governed by men			1
i was so confused and overwhelmed by some of the feedback i received that i took my tweet down and for that i was called spineless			0
i questioned myself ? did i really mean what i said ? can i stand tall ? do i even know what i was talking about ? i realised the best thing to do was to shut up and really get honest with myself			0
what i hated the most was that i took a tweet down			0
i had wavered and was full of self - doubt			0
i so i asked myself over the last 3 days – why i did i do it ? why did i take that tweet down ? these are my conclusions … i. i was so afraid of upsetting people , and not being liked for saying something that was not to everyone ’s taste			2
also , i suddenly thought given the adverse reaction , did i even really know enough about @entity3 ? was i just trying to be relevant ? she had obviously upset a lot of people			2
but now i realise that i do admire a woman , whether she is right or wrong , regardless of her opinions			0
she had the courage to stand by her convictions			2
i look at my behavior , which exposed how weak i was under fire , not like @entity3			2
