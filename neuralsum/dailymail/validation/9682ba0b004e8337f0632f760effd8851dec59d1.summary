another weekend and more discussions and dissatisfaction with officiating			0
at @entity4 i could actually understand how @entity5 thought that @entity6 had clipped @entity7 but the clear and obvious foul was clearly by @entity9			1
@entity10 was right to award the penalty kick			0
what mystified me was that the @entity13 decided , unusually , to issue a statement regarding the incident , perhaps in an attempt to support one of their officials			0
@entity10 's statement , in which he felt @entity6 had made the foul for the penalty , makes it impossible for the @entity24 to transfer the red card to @entity9 as they can only do so when the referee accepts that he has disciplined the wrong player			1
@entity6 was sent off for a foul on @entity7 even though it appeared @entity9 made the contact @entity33 's side are appealing @entity6 's red card but an overturn is n't certain @entity5 sends off @entity6 ( right ) and @entity36 admits he can understand his decision to show him the red card now the red card will be issued to @entity6 , although he has appealed it as he did not foul @entity7			1
had no statement been made then the card could have been transferred and natural justice could have taken place - even when referees get decisions right there appears to be a mess - up			2
nothing is certain , however , in the discredited disciplinary process following the @entity49 and @entity51 incident			0
@entity49 could not be charged for a clearly and widely accepted red card challenge while a player guilty of violent conduct , according to the @entity24 , had a reduced ban for some bizarre reason			2
either he was guilty or not			0
another example is that @entity59 captain @entity58 should be charged for his clearly deliberate forearm smash on @entity62 's @entity61 towards the end of @entity59 's win at @entity65			1
it appeared to be unseen by referee @entity67 but was around the area of active play , where the ball was present , so could that be deemed as 're - refereeing ' an incident ? i hope not as the @entity73 certainly deserves a ban for the mindless assault			1
@entity58 's elbow was labelled a ' mindless assault ' and @entity36 says he should be punished the @entity59 midfielder caught @entity62 striker @entity61 and was lucky not to injure him there was more dissatisfaction , and this time by both mangers over the performance of referee @entity83 at the @entity84			1
there were three key incidents although both @entity87 and @entity88 seemed less than happy with the general refereeing			2
two acts of serious foul play escaped @entity83 's detection and @entity93 was involved in both			1
first he went into a challenge with @entity95 leading with a sideways , stamping studs first boot which could have caused a really nasty injury â€“ it certainly endangered his opponents safety and should have led to a red card			0
just ten minutes later it appeared that @entity106 's @entity105 decided to take the law into his own hands and went through @entity93 from behind , raking straight down the back of the @entity112 midfielder 's calf and causing a nasty injury			2
another red card tackle which did n't even merit yellow for @entity83			2
perhaps the @entity24 will act or maybe they 'll say they can not			0
the fact that the only goal of the game came from @entity119 who was in an offside position led to more understandable frustration			0
unfortunately the video replays that the game needs to correct such errors was turned down by the @entity125 at their meeting this weekend			0
@entity93 lies injured after a after a tackle from @entity105 which left him needing stitches the @entity130 international is unlikely to receive any ban from the @entity24 as the officials saw the incident			1

@entity6 was sent off for a foul on @entity7 when it appeared @entity9 fouled him but @entity5 's decision was understandable at the time
@entity33 's side have appealed but nothing is certain with the bizarre rules
@entity58 needs to be punished for his ' mindless assault ' on @entity62 striker @entity61 during @entity59 's 3 - 1 win at @entity65
@entity87 and @entity88 were both *unhappy* with @entity83
@entity93 was left needing a number of stitches after the clash
