after 50 years as the lead singer of the @entity2 , @entity0 has regaled the world with some of the ­ lessons he has learned from a lifetime of rock ' n ' roll			1
on an @entity8 tv chat show last week , he revealed his ten pearls of wisdom			1
not surprisingly , these included his views on that unholy trinity of sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll			1
now in his 70th year , he self - deprecatingly quipped : ' you start out playing rock and roll so you can have sex and do drugs			1
but you end up doing drugs so you can play rock and roll and have sex			1
' rock veteran : @entity0 performing with @entity2 earlier this month in @entity25 it was a good joke			1
but , with the career he 's had , he must surely have picked up more than a mere ten ideas as to how life should be lived			0
here are a few he appears to have overlooked			1
do n't write @entity31 , if you must , always put in something so secret , so deeply embarrassing about the recipient that she can never sell it for fear of making the information public			0
if he had heeded this , @entity0 would have avoided the ignominy of his former lover @entity40 , the mother of his daughter , @entity41 , auctioning his letters to her for £ 175,000			1
like royalty , @entity43 is one lesson @entity0 learned long ago			1
that means the public still does not know for sure if he was indeed caught in flagrante at @entity48 with princess @entity49			0
rock royalty : @entity0 with ( from left ) @entity51 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 in 1964 be your own boss though one of the biggest acts in the world , the @entity2 still do n't own the rights to their biggest hit records from the @entity63 , such as satisfaction and @entity65 , due to ­ contracts signed early on			1
keep a diary decades ago @entity0 agreed to write his autobiography and took a very large advance from a publisher , only to have to return it when he realised he could n't remember anything of what he had got up to in the @entity63 and @entity74			1
he must have lost millions in potential book sales			0
@entity76 a middle - aged woman , @entity0 was faced with the choice between keeping his face plump and sacrificing the figure , or maintaining those slim hips and sacrificing the face			1
he went with the gamine shape			0
@entity84 albums whenever he has brought out a solo album it has bombed			0
@entity86 , released in 1987 , was described as ' garbage '			0
the @entity2 is the brand — almost as famous as @entity88			1
he 's just their poster boy			0
ex : singer @entity40 sold love letters @entity0 sent to her for £ 175,000 at auction never share a girlfriend with @entity94 talk , as he found out a year ago to his embarrassment			1
@entity51 's autobiography contained a very unflattering revelation from @entity0 's former girlfriend @entity98 about his the size of manhood ­ ­ ­ — disclosed while she and @entity51 were in bed together			2
... and expect trouble if you do @entity104 might not have been so spiteful if his mate had n't been romancing @entity51 's girlfriend @entity106 at the same time as him			0
@entity108 not to @entity107 1997 , @entity0 and @entity51 had to share royalties with singer - songwriter k.d.lang for accidentally borrowing from her hit ' @entity112 '			1
neither @entity114 can explain how the lifted tune ended up on the @entity2 ' single , ' @entity113 ? ' , but it was definitely there			2
@entity119 @entity118 hired @entity120 to police a concert at @entity122 in ­ @entity123 in 1969 , only for the bikers to beat and stab a fan to death			0
trouble : @entity104 , left with @entity106 and son @entity127 in 1969 , and right on stage with @entity0 this month @entity129 doubles a star 's appeal , which doubles the number of potential fans of either sex — which , in turn , ­ doubles the profits			2
@entity138 on the @entity141 @entity140 rock star will be ­ forgiven almost anything if he 's spotted in a floppy hat at @entity144 on a summer 's day			0
@entity146 ' the greatest rock and roll band in the world ' , it says on the billboards			2
by saying it loud and often enough , @entity0 has convinced the world they still are charmers : @entity0 with fellow rock legend @entity154 in 1985 wear a codpiece it 's worked a treat on stage for many years — indeed , @entity155 used to take huge pleasure in pointing it out			1
@entity163 at the aggravation @entity162 got themselves into when @entity165 began turning up at recording sessions and sitting on an amp			0
a rock ' n ' roll man 's got to do what a @entity168 's got to do			2
@entity170 remains a chameleon and a mystery			0
and mystery sells out stadiums			0
run your business with a @entity177 is famously tough with his crew on @entity2 tours			2
the word is that any of the crew caught taking drugs while working is sacked ! pearls of wisdom : @entity0 revealed the lessons learned on @entity187 last week @entity188 will get you @entity189 was right , when she sang the lines ' you 're so vain : you probably think this song is about you			1
' regardless of whether she was singing about @entity0 or the actor @entity195 , vanity never held either back			2
move on quickly luckily , everyone 's already ­ forgotten about @entity197 , the supergroup he formed a ­ couple of years ago with soul singer @entity114 and @entity201 front man @entity200			0
know your worth when the band began they were just five guys on stage , with no fireworks and no massive stage effects			0
but , the greater the effects , the more they can charge for seats , and therefore the bigger the profits			0
take a risk before @entity0 , world famous rock stars did n't have degrees , and as an undergraduate he wondered if it was worth the risk of dropping out			1
he left the @entity220 two years into his degree — albeit with the option of going back to finish his studies if the @entity2 did n't make it			2
bad boy : @entity98 outside @entity226 in @entity227 with @entity0 in 1969 be ruthless for the good of the group , @entity55 had to be pushed out of the @entity2 when his drugs habit spiralled out of control			1
charm the great and the @entity234 's all very well having great mates , but it never hurts to have friends in high places			0
in 1967 , @entity0 was jailed for a minor drug offence			2
then , after an editorial in @entity240 saying the sentence was draconian , he was swiftly released and helicoptered to a tv meeting with the editor of @entity240 , a former home secretary and a @entity245			0
never be dull in a letter to singer @entity40 , @entity0 described @entity155 and @entity165 as being ' boring ' when they went on their peace campaign in 1970			1
he could never be accused of that			0
sell out if your must @entity51 accused @entity0 of being too willing to be influenced by the @entity252			2
but that was just @entity51 , clinging to his buccaneer image			0
having @entity255 as a fan got @entity0 a knighthood			2
never call @entity53 ' @entity258 clouted him in the face on the one occasion he did and , in return , described @entity0 as ' my singer			1
' cricket lover : @entity0 and son @entity265 watching @entity140 play @entity266 at the @entity267 in 2000			0
