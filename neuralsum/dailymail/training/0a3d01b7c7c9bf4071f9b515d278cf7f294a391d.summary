outside court today , @entity53 from the @entity54 said : ' i 'm pleased with the outcome today - mr @entity2 has now seen first - hand the full force of the @entity41 legislation in action			2

repayment : @entity2 , pictured outside @entity68 today , still owes more than £ 600,000 ' the court assessed how much @entity2 benefited from crime some time ago , and today they have taken into account recently identified assets which the judge has agreed can be confiscated			2
