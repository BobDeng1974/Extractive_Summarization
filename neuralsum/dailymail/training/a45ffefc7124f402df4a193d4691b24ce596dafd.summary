by @entity0 published : 16:17 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 16:32 est , 24 september 2012 @entity1 's has launched a deep - dish pizza which contains more than double the number of calories found in its regular pies			1
the 12 " pepperoni pan pizza , which features a thick base , slathered with butter , two layers of cheese and toppings , boasts 2,420 calories and 130 grams of fat			1
it makes for a dramatic contrast with the nutritional value of its regular thin - crust version , at 910 calories and 47 grams of fat			0
slice of pie : @entity1 's has launched a 12 " pepperoni pan pizza which boasts 2,420 calories and 130 grams of fat the new pie also contains 43 grams more fat than a 40 - piece bucket of chicken on sale at the chain and 138 more carbohydrates than an eight - piece bread basket			1
as far as rival chains are concerned the @entity1 's pan pizza , which will initially retail for $ 7.99 , also proves to be a fattier option			1
@entity36 choice : the thin crust @entity1 's pizza is considerably less fatty than its new pan pizza option , which is baked in butter @entity1 's @entity42 contains more calories than traditional offerings			1
here we see how it 's calorie and fat content compares : it contains 500 more calories than the @entity51 's 12 " equivalent ( 1,920 cals ) and 420 more calories than @entity55 's pepperoni thick base offering ( 2,000 cals )			2
@entity57 's pepperoni pie has one of the lowest calorie counts at 1,840 per 12 " round and 230 per 1/8 slice			0
according to @entity63 , the author of @entity64 , who has been cloning fast food favourites at home for decades , the pan pizza is made by pressing dough into a well - oiled or buttered pan , which is more similar to a cake pan than a typical pizza pan			0
the pan is then covered and baked for up to 60 minutes before being topped and sprayed with a butter - flavoured product which helps achieve a golden crust			0
it is the third time @entity1 's has attempted to break the $ 6.4 billion deep pan pizza market dominated by @entity55			1
in 1986 , the butter - baked creation was introduced by chain but many stores decided not to promote it because they took too long to prepare - the baking process can take up to two hours			0
and in 1997 when the pan pizza was introduced for a second time poor sales prompted decision - makers to scrap it from the menu			0
more than 5,000 @entity1 's stores across the @entity87 will be serving up pan pizzas as of today and an accompanying television ad campaign will launch on october 1			2
pan pizza compared : @entity57 's 12 " deep pan pie has 1,840 calories ( left ) while @entity55 's version contains almost 500 calories less than the @entity1 's version on of the key features of @entity1 's pan pizza is that the dough used to make the bases will be fresh , while many pizza chains still use frozen premixes			1
commenting on the launch @entity103 , ceo at @entity1 's told @entity106 magazine : ' there is a standard out there for pan pizza that we realized could be better			2
' the reason most people buy a pan pizza is for the crust , and that key component should be fresh , never frozen			0
' but what we think ultimately does n't matter ; i 'd encourage customers to taste for themselves			0
