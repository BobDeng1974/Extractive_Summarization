he and a colleague were manning a general purpose machine gun in the mock battle for more than 100 troops in hot terrain , the court heard			1
to their right , fusilier @entity39 , a gunner , and fusilier @entity41 , a controller , also from @entity43 , were operating another , watched by their safety supervisor @entity45			1
this gun jammed and would not fire - known in military terms as a ‘ hard cock ’ - making it impossible to check if the firearm was unloaded , @entity46 in @entity47 heard			2
but instead of following safety procedure and calling in an armourer to fix it , @entity45 allegedly got @entity55 and @entity56 to remove the weapon from its position and he took it apart			1
@entity45 placed the gun on the ground , pointing directly at the gun team , and removed the barrel			1
troops were alerted to @entity65 , hailed as a very fit soldier with ‘ long term potential ’ by the @entity68 , being down by someone shouting ‘ @entity70 ’			2
now three of his comrades - @entity55 , @entity56 and staff sergeant @entity73 are on trial for negligently performing a duty			2
@entity45 is also accused of negligently performing a duty			2
prosecutor lieutenant colonel @entity77 told the jury : ‘ each of these men failed to do what they were required to do and they each in their own way led to the tragic outcome			2
‘ the crown ’s case is about basic principles , about basic common sense , which we say are commonly understood by anyone wearing this @entity91 uniform			0
laid to rest : fusilier @entity8 's funeral took place in @entity95 , @entity10 , in december 2011 ‘ it is about basic duties expected of a safety supervisor on live firing exercises			1
i ask you to keep in mind these principles and common sense in the judgement of the facts			0
’ ‘ each defendant owed a duty of care to @entity8			1
they owed him a duty that he was not put in danger			0
each neglected this and the consequences were catastrophic			0
’ ' they owed him a duty that he was not put in danger			0
each neglected this and the consequences were catastrophic ' prosecutor lt col @entity77 fusilier @entity8 ’s distraught widow @entity25 wept in court as she heard details of the fatal incident on november 26 2011 , less than five months after their wedding			1
she was seven months ’ pregnant with the couple ’s first child at the time , and has since given birth to a healthy daughter			0
lt col @entity77 said : ‘ @entity45 , clearly anxious to get one of his guns back in action , demanded to know what was happening and was told it was a hard cock			0
hearing this , he ordered for it to be brought to him			0
the prosecution case is that that gun should not have been moved			2
grief : fusilier @entity8 's wife @entity25 left the church after the funeral in 2011 dressed all in black ‘ but @entity39 and @entity41 brought the gun over to him , and @entity17 asked if it was cleared or was it unloaded			1
fusilier @entity41 responded that yes , it was , it was clear			0
‘ this , of course , was incorrect - there was a live round in the weapon			0
they should have realised this			0
they were experienced infantry soldiers used to handling machine guns			2
’ captain @entity158 , a range conducting officer , was around 25 metres away from @entity160 when tragedy struck during the ‘ fast moving ’ exercise			0
he said a safety supervisor should call in an armourer to deal with a stoppage , adding : ‘ you can not remove the round , so the round will be stuck in the weapons system			1
‘ so the safest way of removing it would be to get an armourer onto the range and make sure the weapon is pointing in a safe direction while you wait			2
’ @entity177 fan @entity65 was born into a serving @entity91 family in @entity179			0
he joined the @entity91 in may 2011 and trained at @entity180 , @entity181 , before being deployed to @entity16 on his first battalion level exercise , @entity183			1
the @entity68 described @entity65 as an ‘ exceptionally fit ’ soldier who was ‘ happy , enthusiastic and immensely popular across all ranks ’ and had ‘ obvious long term potential ’			0
@entity55 and @entity56 deny negligence performing a duty in misinforming @entity45 as to the safety state of the gun and failing to prevent the discharge of a round			1
staff sgt @entity73 denies negligence performing a duty by failing to prevent the unintentional discharge of a round from the gun			1
the court martial continues tomorrow			0
