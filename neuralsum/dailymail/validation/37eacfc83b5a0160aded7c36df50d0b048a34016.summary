@entity4 had held the position in the @entity21 suburb since 2007			1
the @entity10 launched an investigation into @entity6 's police department and municipal court after the august 9 shooting death of unarmed black teenager @entity26 by a white police officer			1

' i believe that the city of @entity6 has the resolve to overcome the challenges it faces in the coming months and emerge as a stronger community for it , ' @entity4 , 39 , said in a statement included in the release			1
since @entity26 's death seven months ago , mayor @entity44 has been the public face and voice of @entity6 's city government			2

in one instance , he responded to a @entity90 email about a record - setting month for court revenue — nearly $ 180,000 in february 2011 alone — with the exclamation , ' wonderful ! ' catalyst : the @entity10 launched an investigation into policing practices in @entity6 after officer @entity96 ( left ) shot and killed 18 - year - old @entity26 in august @entity1 divided : analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed @entity105 - @entity104 make up 93 percent of arrests and when @entity90 told @entity4 in january 2013 that municipal court revenue had exceeded $ 2million the previous year , the city manager was similarly excited			1
' @entity109 ! ' he said , according to the federal inquiry			0
municipal judge @entity111 stepped down to help the divided city ' begin its healing process ' but in a statement issued after the announcement of his departure , @entity4 said his office ' never instructed the police department to target @entity104 , nor falsify charges to administer fines , nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor			2
any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false , ' @entity4 said			0
@entity4 's resignation comes a day after @entity128 judge @entity111 stepped down to help the divided city ' begin its healing process ' and to promote public confidence in the court system			1
last thursday , two @entity132 commanders also quit after racist emails were released during the @entity10 's investigation into the police department			0
sgt. @entity136 and capt. @entity137 resigned thursday and @entity139 clerk @entity138 was fired wednesday			0
@entity141 attorney general @entity140 called the @entity10 's report ' searing , ' saying the investigation found the @entity6 community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be ' disproportionately harmful to @entity104 residents			1
' ' this investigation found a community that was deeply polarized , ' @entity140 said			0
' a community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents			0
' a community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue			2
' @entity164 : last thursday , two @entity132 commanders also quit after racist emails were released during the @entity10 's investigation speaking out : @entity141 attorney general @entity140 called the @entity10 's report ' searing ' @entity6 mayor @entity44 said friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the @entity10 , @entity168 reports			1
speaking at a town hall event in @entity175 two days after the release of the @entity10 report , president @entity173 said the @entity6 probe exposed a ' broken , racially biased system			1
' a @entity21 grand jury and the @entity10 both declined to bring charges in the @entity26 shooting against officer @entity96 , who left the department			0
the @entity10 report said @entity96 acted in self - defense when he shot @entity26			2
but the agency said in its report last week that @entity6 's police and court systems functioned as a money - making enterprise that heightened tensions among residents			2
strong words : president @entity173 said the @entity6 probe exposed a ' broken , racially biased system ' the @entity10 report cited cases of racial profiling and bigotry by the predominantly white police force in the mostly black @entity21 suburb			1
@entity26 's shooting prompted protests in the @entity21 area and across the nation			0
