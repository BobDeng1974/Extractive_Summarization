today , for the first time in 13 years , whistleblowing consultant cardiologist dr @entity0 can look to the future with a glimmer of hope			1
after more than a decade of ‘ torture ’ - during which he says @entity11 bosses ‘ tried to silence me , destroy my reputation and erase me from the face of the @entity9 ’ - his good name was this week dramatically restored			1
bullied and then sacked by his @entity11 bosses after exposing the avoidable deaths of patients at his @entity20 hospital , the 54 - year - old heart specialist was vindicated on thursday after a @entity24 - and - @entity23 battle thought to have cost taxpayers £ 10million			1
vindicated : dr @entity0 with his wife @entity26 suspended in 2002 after he exposed the fact that two patients had died in overcrowded bays at his hospital , dr @entity0 fell victim to what he described as a ‘ heinous ’ smear campaign			1
he was reinstated in 2010 , only to be dismissed a year later as he lay seriously ill in hospital			1
but his name was finally cleared this week when an employment tribunal found that dr @entity0 had been unfairly dismissed			1
in a landmark judgment , the tribunal ruled that dr @entity0 had been targeted specifically by hospital managers because he ’d blown the whistle on dangerous practices			1
this is dr @entity0 ’s first in - depth newspaper interview since his name was cleared , and what he reveals is a shocking indictment of the way the @entity11 is managed and the way it treats staff who speak out on behalf of patients			1
he is now seeking a meeting with health minister @entity51 , but has this stark warning for any other health professional thinking of blowing the whistle to protect their patients			2
‘ do n’t do it , because the way i have been treated is nothing short of an outrage and a scandal , ’ said dr @entity0 , a once world - renowned specialist who is now unemployed and doubts his medical career will ever recover			1
‘ instead of listening to me , embracing what i said and working with me to improve conditions for patients , trust managers tried to destroy me			1
it was a form of torture			2
‘ they stopped at nothing to change the focus from the patients - who were at the heart of my concerns - onto false claims about this allegedly “ bad doctor ” who needed to be removed			2
‘ they tried to shut me up and sideline me			2
i was marched from my office in broad daylight in front of my staff , colleagues and patients sitting in my waiting room			2
persecuted : dr @entity0 told how he was marched out of his office by security guards and suspended for years after blowing the whistle ‘ rather than work with me to improve patient care , they searched for reasons to discredit me , humiliate me and destroy my career			1
and once they ’d set the wheels in motion , they were prepared to throw millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money at it			2
‘ i am relieved that this judgment completely vindicates me			2
it found i had not caused nor contributed to my dismissal ; that my dismissal was inextricably linked to whistleblowing and that i had suffered directly			2
‘ patients have been betrayed			0
even today , there has still been no investigation into the deaths that i witnessed			2
’ yesterday , a spokesperson for @entity20 ( formerly @entity110 ) said in a statement : ‘ we are disappointed by the @entity113 ’s decision that the dismissal of dr @entity0 was unfair , given that the procedure followed by the @entity110 was reviewed by the @entity116 in march 2012 when it found in the @entity110 ’s favour			1
‘ @entity118 now needs to examine the @entity113 ’s decision in more detail ( it runs to 400 pages ) to consider its grounds for appeal			0
‘ as a @entity110 , we will continue to support all our staff to raise issues of concern in our effort to provide continuous improvement in our services to patients			1
’ born in @entity20 , dr @entity0 graduated from @entity131 and has been employed by the @entity11 since 1984 , working at a number of teaching hospitals in @entity134 and in @entity135			1
he was a heart specialist of international standing , and attracted millions of pounds in funding for research into the genetic causes of heart disease			0
he helped establish medical schools and says he was head - hunted by the @entity110 in @entity20 and tasked with doing the same there			1
it was through his work that he met his wife @entity26 , 41 , who works for a pharmaceutical company , although the stress of the past decade has put enormous strain on both their lives			0
married in 2009 , dr @entity0 ’s ill - health - he suffers from an auto - immune disease - was exacerbated by the stress			1
‘ i am very fortunate that my wife has stood by me throughout and been a huge source of strength , ’ he says			0
‘ we had hoped to have a family by now , and , @entity160 willing , we will have children			0
i hope they will have a father still able to kick a ball around in the park with them			0
’ until he arrived at @entity20 ’s @entity20 , dr @entity0 says that there had never been a single complaint about him			1
it is a source of professional pride that the bosses who seemed so keen to be rid of him after he blew the whistle found not one incident of alleged clinical negligence to include with the 200 false allegations that they made			1
these false claims included fraud , bullying , bribery and sexual impropriety - which both the @entity180 and the police dismissed as completely unfounded			2
dr @entity0 clearly remembers the day in december 1999 when a 35 - year - old man who was vomiting blood died on an acute medical ward			1
dr @entity0 says the bay was overcrowded so that medical staff were unable to move him nearer life - saving equipment			1
he believes the man ’s death could have been avoided			0
‘ when a patient dies in such circumstances , it is very distressing and demoralising			0
you try to do your absolute best for the individual , even if it is just to ease their suffering if you can not save them			0
‘ and i felt those patients who died in our hospital should n’t have died - and certainly not on that day at that time			2
there were five patients in a four - bed bay			0
if one of those patients was in trouble , then we knew we ’d be in serious difficulties			0
‘ it was very upsetting to see that happen			0
the @entity11 has provided money to provide these services			0
it should not be acceptable for some manager to decide to reconfigure the beds in such a dangerous way ‘ i felt i had been prevented from saving these people ’s lives because some manager - without consulting the medical staff - had just decided that that is what they wanted to do			0
’ dr @entity0 says he and other doctors repeatedly raised concerns about the practice of putting five patients in bays designed and equipped for four , and expressed concern over the subsequent deaths			1
after the @entity110 ’s chief executive appeared on @entity233 in september 2001 and denied that deaths had occurred relating to the five - in - four overcrowding , dr @entity0 went public by giving his own interview to @entity238			1
in february 2002 , dr @entity0 was suspended and escorted off the premises pending an investigation into allegations of intimidation made by a junior doctor			1
meeting : dr @entity0 wants to explain his point of view to health secretary @entity51 judgment : a tribunal ruling found against managers at the @entity249 in @entity20 , now @entity20 ‘ that was the most awful experience of my life , being marched out by the medical director and the @entity254 director , with two security guards behind them			1
’ dr @entity0 was suspended from his £ 70,000 - a - year job on three - quarters of his salary for five and a half years			1
according to his solicitors , the @entity11 spent money , too , on a pr agency and on hiring private detectives			0
the suspension alone reportedly cost the trust £ 2.5m			0
‘ it is very distressing when you are prevented by non-medical people from doing what you love doing , when you feel there is so much you can give , ’ says dr @entity0 , whose suspension was the longest in @entity11 history			1
‘ it is also very depressing			0
quite apart from not being able to work , i was prevented from talking to anybody at the hospital , so i also felt isolated from my profession			2
‘ in hindsight , my mistake was to believe that there were enough good men and women in the @entity11 senior management and the @entity282 who would step up and say : “ stop ! what you are doing to this doctor is wrong			0
” ‘ those people are not there			0
instead , there is culture of closing ranks and persecuting any whistleblower			0
‘ i went into medicine because i wanted to spend the rest of my life trying to help people , care for them and possibly save lives along the way			0
that ’s what drives me			0
‘ what managers do is they come in and they want to have a career in management			2
my impression is that it really does n’t matter to these individuals if that ’s in the @entity11 , banking or retail			0
‘ there ’s been a shift in my working life from managers working alongside clinical staff to dictating from a central office how care should be delivered , which may not be in the best interests of patients			2
‘ and so millions of pounds which could have been better spent elsewhere have been wasted persecuting me			0
’ he was determined to fight to clear his name			0
today , he feels he has done that			0
whether his career will ever recover is another matter			0
of his future plans , he says : ‘ for now , i just want to digest the tribunal ruling and spend the next year concentrating on recovering my health			1
