he 's made an inspirational move from his street upbringing to become a bona fide pop star , so it was only a matter of time before @entity6 was hired as a talent show judge			1
the @entity8 born chart - topper , 24 , will be putting his musical knowledge to perfect use when he joins @entity12 and @entity13 on the judging panel for @entity15 's must be the music			1
the lyricist will be helping to find the @entity19 's best new musical act , with hopefuls from every genre encouraged to audition for a chance to win the Â£ 100,000 cash prize			2
singing for @entity24 : @entity25 and @entity6 give it their all as they film the video to @entity24 's unofficial @entity31 song @entity32 said : ' i know how hard it is to break into the music industry and am giving all you fellow musicians out there a chance to come and show me , the other judges and the rest of the @entity19 that we really do have some of the best musicians in the world right under our noses , who deserve a break			1
i 'm here to give you that break			2

success soon followed , with hits including @entity80 , @entity81 , bonkers and latest number one @entity57 , which features @entity84 singer @entity83			0
so it must be said that , with his tough background , which saw him expelled from four different schools , and subsequent climb into the music industry @entity6 is more than qualified to dole out advice to the show 's hopefuls			0
meanwhile , @entity6 could be set for another big hit after recording a @entity31 track with comedian @entity25			1
hoping for victory : @entity96 will no doubt be hoping for another number one with the new single the duo have recorded an unofficial @entity24 anthem ( a cover of @entity103 song @entity104 ) , which they recorded on last saturday 's @entity19 's @entity107 final , and stills from the video have been released in anticipation of the new single			1
