as his craft neared @entity23 , @entity11 helicopters , aeroplanes and battleships were scouring the ocean for @entity22 subs			1
' at that period of time it was called " special weapon " , not " nuclear torpedo " , ’ said @entity53 , junior navigator on @entity54			2
‘ at that time we could n't even imagine a nuclear torpedo			2
’ in a game of high stakes cat and mouse it was n't long before the @entity22 were spotted			2
@entity42 's sub was forced to make an emergency dive			1

i was proud and i am proud of my husband always ' @entity129 , widow of @entity42 ' frankly i do n't think we felt any sympathy for them at all			2
' the @entity11 decided to ratchet up the pressure , and dropped warning grenades into the sea			2
inside the sub , the @entity10 submariners thought they were under attack			2
@entity141 , the captain of @entity40 , was convinced the nuclear war had already started			1
he demanded that the submariners launch their torpedo to save some of @entity22 's pride			1

@entity172 ' @entity173 , historian @entity141 had n't counted on @entity42			2
as commander of the fleet , @entity42 had the last veto			1
and although his men were against him , he insisted that they must not fire - and instead surrender			0
it was a humiliating move - but one that saved the world			0
the @entity10 submariners were forced to return to their native @entity22 , where they were given the opposite of a hero 's welcome			1
