by @entity1 reporter published : 23:09 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 01:14 est , 28 september 2012 the @entity3 replacement ref who signaled a touchdown on the final play of monday night ’s @entity6 - @entity8 game has said he stands by his controversial decision which allowed the @entity8 to win 14 - 12			1
@entity10 , who is out of a job following an end to the labor dispute and the return of the real referees , is adamant he made the correct call			1
' i do n’t appreciate the negative stuff , ' said @entity10 , who feels that he ’s had to shoulder the blame for monday night 's decision			1
the ref on the right called for a stoppage of play scapegoat : @entity10 claims that he did n't do anything wrong ' i did n't do anything wrong , ' @entity10 told @entity36			1
' put any other official who knows the rules and they would make the same call			1
' @entity10 said the @entity6 player who allegedly intercepted the ball never had singular possession because , ' you have to not only have the ball but have either two feet or a body part on the ground , and that never happened			1
' although the @entity3 rulebook cites simultaneous possession is awarded to the passing team , @entity6 cornerback @entity48 clearly came away with the ball prior to @entity8 wide receiver @entity53 , who stripped the ball away as he was tangled with @entity48			1
@entity10 , who normally refs at @entity55 and @entity56 as well as @entity57 , all in @entity58 , said the replacement refs did what they were expected to do			1
' we did a damn good job ... for the most part			0
' his controversial call followed months of an intense labor lockout between the @entity3 and @entity67 , who finally came to an eight - year agreement on thursday morning			2
the stalemate , which saw the @entity3 's referees locked out since the beginning for the pre-season , had been whittled down to disagreements over ' a little money			2
' the real refs returned to the field to officiate thursday night 's game between the @entity79 and the @entity80			1
referee @entity81 and his seven - man crew received a standing ovation as they walked on the field in their familiar stripes for the first game of @entity87			2
one fan held up a sign that read : ' finally ! we get to yell at real refs ! welcome back ! ' ' the other refs just made dumb calls , ' said @entity94 , a 15 - year - old fan wearing an @entity96 jersey			1
' i could n't stand them			0
now we wo n't get robbed ; everything will be fair - hopefully			0
' the officials ran a mostly smooth and efficient first game back , with no headline - making calls as the @entity80 beat the @entity79 23 - 16			1
welcome back : a @entity80 fan holds a sign supporting the return of the real refs prior to the game against the @entity79 ready for action : referee @entity81 , right , and back judge @entity108 , left , look around the field before the game between the @entity80 and @entity79 @entity3 commissioner @entity111 acknowledged that monday night ’s disputed touchdown ' may have pushed the parties further along ' in the talks			1
' obviously when you go through something like this it is painful for everybody , ' @entity111 said			0
' most importantly , it is painful for our fans			0
we are sorry to have to put our fans through that , but it is something that in the short term you sometimes have to do to make sure you get the right kind of deal for the long term and make sure you continue to grow the game			0
' the deal is only tentative - it must be ratified by 51 percent of the union 's 121 members in a vote scheduled for friday and saturday in @entity135			2
the lockout ended after marathon negotiations produced an eight - year agreement to end the lockout that began in june			0
however , for the @entity6 , @entity141 , @entity142 and other teams who voiced their displeasure with calls that might have swayed games , the agreement does n't change their records			2
unwanted fame : @entity10 gestures on the field following his controversial call in the @entity8 ' 14 - 12 victory over the @entity6 the commissioner said he watched monday night 's frenetic @entity6 - @entity8 finish at home			1
' you never want to see a game end like that , ' he said			0
the new agreement will improve officiating in the future , @entity111 asserted , reducing mistakes like those made monday and making the strains of the last three weeks worthwhile			0
@entity111 acknowledged ' you 're always worried ' about the perception of the league			0
' obviously , this has gotten a lot of attention , ' he said			0
' it has n't been positive , and it 's something that you have to fight through and get to the long term			0
... we always are going to have to work harder to make sure we get people 's trust and confidence in us			0
' the dispute even made its way to the campaign trail , with president @entity180 's spokesman , @entity179 , calling thursday ' a great day for @entity181			2
' ' the president 's very pleased that the two sides have come together , ' @entity179 said .			0
