the @entity0 has rubbished @entity2 media reports alleging the pope 's resignation is linked to a secret dossier claiming there is a ' gay network ' inside the clergy			1
@entity2 newspapers have been rife with unsourced reports claiming the secret dossier from three cardinals reveals an underground network of senior clergy who have organised gay homosexual parties and faced blackmail			1
@entity17 newspaper claims the explosive allegations were made in a report into the so - called ' @entity21 ' scandal which was presented to the @entity22 on or around december 17			0
but the @entity0 today accused @entity2 media of spreading ' false and damaging ' reports in an attempt to influence cardinals who will meet in a secret conclave next month to elect a new pope			1
they launched the probe after the @entity22 's butler , @entity21 , was arrested and charged with stealing and leaking papal correspondence revealing how the @entity0 was a centre of intrigue and infighting			2
@entity17 claimed pope @entity49 quit because could not face the repercussions of dealing with the 300 - page dossier - the first @entity22 to resign in 700 years			0
the paper says that the investigation alleges a gay lobby exists within the @entity55 , and has some sort of control on the careers of those in the @entity0			1
no confirmation or denial : @entity0 spokesman @entity62 the report is quoted as saying : ' the cardinals were said to have uncovered an underground gay network , whose members organise sexual meetings in several venues in @entity69 and @entity70 , leaving them prone to blackmail			1
' they included a villa outside the @entity2 capital , a sauna in a @entity69 suburb , a beauty parlour in the centre , and a former university residence that was in use by a provincial @entity2 archbishop			2
' @entity17 says that the cardinals described a number of ' factions ' in their report , including one in which individuals were ' united by sexual orientation '			1
the newspaper also alleges the dossier states that members of this group were blackmailed by laymen with whom they entertain relationships of a ' worldly nature ' it quoted an unnamed source said to be close to the report 's authors : ' everything revolves around the non-observance of the sixth and seventh commandments			2
' the seventh commandment forbids theft , while the sixth forbids adultery , but is linked in @entity108 doctrine to the proscribing of homosexual acts , explained the @entity111			0
the dossier will stay in a secret papal safe and delivered to @entity49 's successor when the @entity22 leaves office , claims @entity17			0
the pope himself has said merely that he does n't have the ' strength of mind and body ' to carry on and would resign feb. 28			0
the @entity0 claims the reports are an attempt to influence the election of the next pope			1
the @entity0 secretariat of state said the @entity55 has for centuries insisted on the independence of its cardinals to freely elect their pope - a reference to episodes in the past when kings and emperors vetoed papal contenders or prevented cardinals from voting outright			2
' if in the past , the so - called powers , i.e. , @entity141 , exerted pressures on the election of the pope , today there is an attempt to do this through public opinion that is often based on judgments that do not typically capture the spiritual aspect of the moment that the church is living , ' the statement said			0
sent to @entity151 : @entity152 has been promoted , according to the @entity0 spokesman ' it is deplorable that as we draw closer to the time of the beginning of the conclave ... that there be a widespread distribution of often unverified , unverifiable or completely false news stories that cause serious damage to persons and institutions			1
' some @entity0 watchers have speculated that because the @entity0 bureaucracy is heavily @entity2 , cardinals might be persuaded to elect a non-italian , @entity169 - based cardinal as pope to try to impose some reform on the @entity172			1
@entity0 spokesman the rev. @entity173 said the reports ' do not correspond to reality ' but the pope and some of his closest collaborators have recently denounced the dysfunction in the @entity179			1
cardinal @entity181 , for example , criticized the ' divisions , dissent , careerism , jealousies ' that afflict the @entity0 bureaucracy			0
he made the comments on friday - the penultimate day of the @entity0 's weeklong spiritual exercises that were attended by the pope and other officials			0
tribute : @entity55 gather to watch the @entity22 in one of this last public appearances @entity49 too has made reference to the divisions in recent days , deploring in his final @entity195 as pope on @entity197 how the church is often ' defiled ' by attacks and divisions from within			0
last sunday , he urged its members to overcome ' pride and egoism '			0
on saturday , in his final comments to the @entity172 , @entity49 lamented the ' evil , suffering and corruption ' that have defaced @entity209 's creation			0
but he also thanked the @entity0 bureaucrats for having helped him ' bear the burden ' of his ministry with their work , love and faith these past eight years			0
the @entity0 's attack on the media echoed its response to previous scandals , where it has tended not to address the underlying content of accusations , but has diverted attention away			1
during the 2010 explosion of sex abuse scandals , the @entity0 accused the media of trying to attack the pope ; during the 2012 leaks scandal , it accused the media of sensationalism without addressing the content of the leaked documents .			2
