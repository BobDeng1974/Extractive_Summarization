by @entity0 published : 11:26 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 11:26 est , 19 december 2012 verisimilitude : @entity2 as @entity3 in the classic adaptation @entity5 @entity3 's sudden switch from tight - fisted miser to saintly benefactor is a realistic portrayal of humans going through life - changing experience , a forthcoming study claims			1
psychologists investigating the people who have experienced profound , sudden and lasting personal change give @entity17 top marks for his portrayal of @entity3 's transformation			1
they say the fictional @entity3 would fit right in with the 14 people who took part in their study who had all hit rock bottom before they turned themselves around			1
' like our participants , @entity3 was suffering , ' said @entity27 , former student at @entity28 and co-author			1
there was a world that was ripe for change because of suffering going on			0
' though @entity3 had money , he hit rock bottom in terms of relationships			1
orphaned as a child and broken - hearted from a failed engagement , his pains intensify each @entity43 , the anniversary of the death of his only friend , @entity45			1
in the story , @entity45 appears seven years after his death as a voice of warning			2
though a ghost , the role he plays is true to life			2
most study participants described the presence of a trusted other person during their experience			1
' just by their presence , a trusted friend can open up possibilities and a sense of faith in what 's possible that one ca n't see , ' mr @entity27 said			1
finding people that fit the criteria of the study was a difficult task , the researchers said			2
to do so , they employed ads on @entity70 in @entity71 and @entity72			0
notably , the experiences shared by participants were not recent events			0
on average , nine years had passed between the transformation and their interview			0
nevertheless , most of them could still remember the exact time of day when the turning point occurred			0
' i 've often thought about this , whether these transformations are really sudden or gradual , ' mr @entity27 said			0
' it 's like water boiling – you can look at that as a discontinuous change from not boiling to boiling , but there are certain elements going on beneath the surface that allow for the dramatic change to take place			2
' the great @entity96 stands in for @entity17 in the muppets ' own version : psychologists say @entity17 ' portrayal of @entity3 's transformation was an accurate representation of how people change in real life for an entrepreneur referred to as @entity107 in the study , the preceding turmoil arose because his identity as a successful businessman crashed along with his failed ventures			1
like @entity3 , he had neglected relationships and said his psyche was ' in a very dark place			2
' but with his breakthrough moment , life instantly took on a whole new meaning for @entity107			0
' i say it 's the best thing that could 've happened , because my life is so much more rewarding than it once was , ' he told the researchers			1
' you ca n't put a price tag on certain ... events that i maybe missed before – certain events , and a marriage , and a family , birthdays , you know ? ' certain things that are just really fun to be a part of are more meaningful , and it is happiness – the kind that lasts			0
' i know these truths have been around forever			0
but for me they 're new			0
' @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 are @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 respectively : at the end of the story , @entity3 takes pity on the impoverished @entity141 family and joins them for the celebrations similarly , another participant 's world crumbled because she based her worth on how well she did in school			1
like @entity3 and @entity107 , she emerged with a new focus on other people			2
' now i measure success by my – how much time i spend serving and doing those things , because those – serving and being with people – are really what bring me satisfaction now , ' she said			0
each of the study participants experienced overwhelming stress prior to their breakthrough			1
study co-author @entity165 , professor of psychology at @entity28 and an expert in human development , wonders whether hitting rock bottom is a necessary ingredient for such positive transformations			1
' that led me to think , well , is there a way that people can capitalize on these mechanisms of change and initiate them themselves instead of bottoming out , ' he said			0
' can you self - initiate this kind of change ? ' mr @entity27 sees another holiday parallel with his research in the film ' it 's a @entity186			2
' after planning to end his life , @entity187 realizes how other people depend on him in @entity190 , prompting his famous line , ' i want to live again ! ' ' those stories are stuck within our culture , ' mr @entity27 said			0
' we all know deep down inside that human beings can and do change in profound and significant ways			0

researchers give @entity17 ' portrayal of the miser 's life - changing transformation top marks
like study participants , @entity3 had reached ' rock bottom ' before taking the steps to change himself for the better
most participants described the presence of a ' trusted friend ' during their experience - like the ghost of @entity3 's friend @entity45
following the transformations , just like @entity3 , those who took part said they gained more sense of the value of others
