by @entity0 , deputy political editor last updated at 11:51 am on 15th november 2011 revelations : @entity2 , pictured yesterday , will face further criticism today as @entity4 is questioned by mps about the @entity7 scandal passport checks were relaxed nearly 2,500 times at airports this summer , according to leaked @entity12 emails			1
the damning documents also reveal that thousands of passengers on private aircraft did not face passport checks at all and were not screened against the terrorist watch list			2
in one email , a @entity12 official at @entity19 raised concerns with managers , complaining : ‘ we are not allowed to physically see the passengers arriving on private charter flights			2
it is creating a situation where we are not able to secure the borders as robustly as we would like , for no justifiable reason			0
’ in a leaked reply , one manager revealed that this policy was followed at airports around the country			1
the revelations will increase pressure on home secretary @entity2 , who faces criticism today as former @entity7 boss @entity4 is questioned by mps on the @entity38			1
he resigned last week after mrs may accused him of taking a pilot scheme to relax biometric passport checks on @entity44 citizens too far by including @entity46 passengers			1
but mr @entity4 hit back , insisting he had been given permission to extend the scheme			1
last night , in written answers to the committee , mrs may admitted the pilot scheme was trialled at 28 ports and airports			1
the leaked emails obtained by the @entity55 reveal that level - two checks – the relaxed regime for @entity44 nationals sanctioned by the home secretary – were used hundreds of times every week for the 14 weeks the scheme ran between july and november			2
border farce : passengers at @entity19 , where controls were waived under pilot scheme which was extended too far they show the rules were relaxed 100 times in the first week , 260 times in the sixth week and 165 times in week nine			1
averaged out over 14 weeks , that would mean border staff could have abandoned full biometric passport checks 2,450 times			2
questions : @entity4 faces @entity37 today official figures show that 2.2million @entity77 and @entity44 nationals and more than 300,000 non-eu citizens enter the @entity77 every week over the summer			1
between 80,000 and 90,000 private flights , mostly carrying two or three passengers , arrive every year			0
pilots on private flights have to file manifest information on their passengers and these details are scrutinised for security threats			0
but the emails reveal @entity12 staff at @entity89 had ‘ no way of checking whether the handling agent information is correct or even if the number of people arriving on [ the ] plane matches the number we have been advised ’			0
an email in june says that staff ‘ feel uneasy about an instruction that is creating an unnecessary gap in security which could bring the @entity7 into disrepute ’			1
in response , @entity12 chiefs said the ‘ no - checks policy ’ was part of a ‘ new national strategy ’			0
shadow home secretary @entity108 said : ‘ this is startling			0
last week the home secretary told us no one had been waved through without checks this summer			0
but these documents show passengers on private flights were n’t even seen			0
‘ last week the @entity117 would n’t admit to having figures about how often checks were downgraded			0
now we know checks were downgraded 260 times in one week			0
’ mrs may last night said that despite the relaxation of checks , figures showed ‘ an almost 10 per cent increase in detection of illegal immigrants and a 48 per cent increase in detection of forged documents compared to the year before ’ .			2
