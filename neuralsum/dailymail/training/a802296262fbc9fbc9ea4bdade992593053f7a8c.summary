but 12 years ago , underwater archaeologist dr @entity33 was searching the @entity35 coastline for @entity37 warships from the 18th century @entity38 , but instead stumbled across the treasures of the lost city			1
after removing layers of sand and mud , divers discovered evidence of extraordinary wealth , painting a picture of what life was like in @entity8 , believed to have been at the centre of @entity15 trade more than 1,000 years ago			1
archaeologists have found remains of more than 64 ships , buried in the seabed four miles off the coast of @entity3 , the largest number of ancient ships ever to be found in one place			0
