@entity0 may have officially arrived , but not at @entity1			0
a @entity3 warden discovered some icebergs still afloat in @entity1 near @entity5			1
@entity6 spotted the floating ice – which was covered in resting seagulls – while doing a routine check of commercial nets in the largest of the @entity11			2
the sight was at odds with data released by the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) at the weekend , which declared all of the @entity11 ice - free			1
the announcement broke an unprecedented seven months of ice coverage , according to @entity21			2
it 's still there ! : @entity24 with son @entity25 , were surprised to come across an iceberg floating on @entity1 on sunday june 8 while trout fishing @entity24 and son @entity25 , of @entity29 , @entity30 , snapped a few photos of @entity1 ice still floating about sunday morning yep , still frozen : @entity3 warden @entity6 took photos of icebergs floating @entity1 , near @entity5			1
the @entity11 were declared ice free on june 7 the lakes normally thaw by the first week of may , but the harsh winter and polar vortex has stalled that , making this a record - breaking year @entity40 marine warden @entity6 & one of the ice islands in @entity1 june 6 , 2014			1
@entity15 ( @entity15 ) declared the @entity11 ice free the following day making the most of it : despite temperatures sitting around 70 and 80 degrees , the ice on @entity1 has failed to completely thaw			1
here some young people play foosball on one of the icebergs , in a photo posted to @entity52 on may 31 according to a @entity55 report , the summer temperatures of the @entity11 are expected to be colder this year because more than 90 percent of the lakes had been covered in ice during this past winter warden @entity59 eyes the iceberg near @entity5 in @entity1 on june 6 the lakes normally thaw by the first week of may			1
however , due to the harsh winter that gripped most of @entity64 this year and the polar vortex , the ice lasted into june			2
in march , the @entity11 were 92.5 percent frozen			1
@entity15 reported that the ice has never lasted this late in the year , based on their data			0
' we saw the ice as early as november 25 and now into june , ' @entity15 scientist @entity68 told the @entity71			0
' in terms of duration i would think it 's up there , if not at the top of the chart [ in the historic record ]			0
' mr @entity80 said he was shocked to still see icebergs , considering temperatures in the area sitting around 70 degrees			0
but the temperatures are not strong enough to melt the ice			0
' there was this big iceberg along with other ice packs and bergs floating around backside of @entity5 area east towards @entity92 , ' mr @entity80 told @entity93 @entity30			2
all of the @entity11 , including @entity1 , were declared ice free on june 7 , marking the end of a record breaking seven month stretch where the lakes were covered in at least one ice cube the water temperatures of the @entity11 will be significantly colder this summer			1
earlier this year @entity101 revealed that even though @entity64 was a full month into astronomical spring , the @entity11 have been slow to give up on the harsh winter			2
the space agency published a stunning picture of the @entity11 , showing a third of their expanse is still covered in ice			2
@entity1 was found to be the most affected , and was found to be 63.5 percent ice covered on april 20th			1
the stunning image was taken by the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) on @entity101 ’s @entity112 satellite			0
it captured a unique natural - color image of @entity1 , which straddles the @entity115 – @entity117 border			0
at the time @entity112 passed over , the lake was 63.5 percent ice covered , according to the @entity15 @entity120 ( @entity120 )			1
on april 20 , 2014 , @entity101 's @entity112 satellite captured this natural - color image of @entity1 , which straddles the @entity115 / @entity117 border			1
at the time @entity112 passed over , the lake was a record 63.5 percent ice covered			1
averaged across @entity1 , ice was 22.6 centimeters ( 8.9 inches ) thick ; it was as much as twice that thickness in some locations averaged across @entity1 , ice was 22.6 centimeters ( 8.9 inches ) thick ; it was as much as twice that thickness in some locations			0
for comparison , @entity1 had 3.6 percent ice cover on april 20 , 2013 ; in 2012 , ice was completely gone by april 12			1
in the last winter that ice cover grew so thick on @entity1 ( 2009 ) , it reached 93.7 percent on march 2 but was down to 6.7 percent by april 21			1
average water temperatures on all of the @entity11 have been rising over the past 30 to 40 years and ice cover has generally been shrinking			0
( @entity1 ice was down about 79 percent since the 1970s			0
) but chilled by persistent polar air masses throughout the 2013 - 14 winter , ice cover reached 88.4 percent on february 13 and 92.2 percent on march 6 , 2014 , the second highest level in four decades of record - keeping			1

icebergs can still be seen floating in @entity1 near @entity5 , off the shore of @entity3
