by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity2 has said it will be ' for the people of @entity5 to decide ' if they want to keep the @entity6 as head of state if the country votes for independence the @entity6 could be removed as head of state if @entity5 votes for independence , a senior @entity12 minister has said			1
@entity2 , the @entity5 justice minister , said ‘ it will be for the people of @entity5 to decide ’ if the country becomes a republic or remains a monarchy			1
@entity20 ’s official policy is that the monarchy would be automatically be retained if @entity5 decides to secede - but many in his party are staunch republicans			2
mr @entity2 ’s intervention in support of a referendum on becoming a republic at some point after independence is achieved further undermines the first minister ’s position			1
a poll out this weekend shows the gap between the ‘ yes ’ and ‘ no ’ votes in the independence plebiscite has narrowed			0
the survey , conducted by @entity38 , found that 39 per cent would vote ‘ yes ’ in the referendum - an increase of two percentage points on the previous month			0
the percentage of ‘ no ’ votes fell from 49 in february to 46 per cent , leaving the proportion of ‘ do n’t knows ’ at 15 per cent ( down one percentage point on last month )			0
it means a swing of just five per cent could see the @entity48 dissolved when the vote takes place on 18 september			0
mr @entity20 ’s strategy is to persuade people that not much would change if @entity5 votes to leave the @entity55 , from keeping the pound to retaining the @entity6			1
but mr @entity2 ’s comments , in response to question about whether @entity5 should become a republic , have undermined that position			1
at a public meeting last week , he reiterated the @entity63 ’s official position that ‘ we will inherit the situation we have with the @entity6 as head of state in the ceremonial capacity that she has ’			1
the minister continued : ‘ but it will be for the people of @entity5 to decide			1
if and when that would occur , if they wished to have a referendum , and we would hope we would become the government post- 2016 , it will be for whoever is in office then			0
’ official @entity12 policy for the last 50 years has always been to keep the @entity6 as head of state , and a spokesman said @entity2 ' totally backs that policy ' until now , mr @entity2 ’s was most famous for his controversial decision to release the @entity82 bomber @entity81 back to @entity83 on the basis that he was close to death with prostate cancer			1
in fact , he lived on for another two years and nine months			0
he is not the first pro-independence figure to support the abolition of the monarchy north of the border			0
@entity91 , the @entity5 children ’s minister , and @entity94 , the @entity5 culture minister , have also called for a post-secession referendum on keeping the @entity6			1
@entity96 , the campaign ’s chairman , has said @entity98 should never be @entity6 of @entity5			2
the @entity63 said it had been @entity12 policy for 50 years to keep the monarchy in an independent @entity5			1
‘ @entity2 backs that policy totally , ’ a spokesman said			2
@entity103 , the @entity5 @entity104 deputy leader , said : ‘ you have to wonder whether there is truly anyone in yes @entity5 ’s leadership or the @entity12 , other than the first minister , who is in tune with the @entity5 public ’s continuing affection and support for the monarchy			1
‘ there is surely little doubt that whatever promises and assertions are made before the referendum they would count for nothing if @entity5 were to be seduced into voting yes			2
@entity94 ( left ) , @entity5 culture minister , and @entity91 ( right ) , children 's minister , have also called for a referendum on having the @entity6 as head of state if the country votes for independence ‘ this motley alliance , including @entity2 , would then be doing all they could to pursue their minority republican views and it would be tiger whose tail even @entity20 would struggle to hold			1
’ the @entity5 and @entity137 crowns were united in 1603 when @entity138 died without issue			2
she was replaced by the @entity5 king @entity140 , who became @entity140 of @entity137			2
a century later , in 1707 , the countries politically united to form the @entity142			0
last night an investment firm warned that an independent @entity5 faces high debt and weak economic growth			0
but @entity146 said fears of an exodus of banks amid nationalist anti-business sentiment were unlikely			0
its report concluded that independence ‘ would bring major uncertainties , costs and risks - mostly for @entity5 , but also for the remaining @entity55 ’			0
a currency union looks ‘ unfeasible ’ , leaving @entity5 with the choice of joining the euro , which ‘ does not appear to be a near term option ’ , or launching its own currency pegged to sterling or its other main trading partners and to the price of oil , it said .			0

@entity12 policy for 50 years has been to keep the @entity6 as head of state
justice minister @entity2 said country could ditch the monarch
said it was ' for the people of @entity5 to decide ' whether to keep queen
