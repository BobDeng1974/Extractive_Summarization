by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:24 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 03:49 est , 14 december 2012 law changes to make sure @entity3 and @entity4 of @entity6 's first baby can succeed to the throne are to be rushed through parliament			2
mps will meet on monday to start rewriting 660 - year - old laws to ensure that if the royal couple have a girl she will become @entity14 , even if she has a young brother			0
ministers are to prioritise the law change with the urgency usually reserved for anti-terror laws			0
just a week after the @entity4 left the king edward vii hospital , ministers published new legislation to ensure their son or daughter becomes monarch the @entity26 will stop men leapfrogging an older woman in line to the throne			1
it will also scrap the ban on anyone in line to the throne marrying a @entity36			0
ministers had insisted that a deal agreed by @entity40 countries to change the succession rules last year would be backdated , so there was no need to rush legislation			1
but barely a week after @entity4 and @entity46 announced they were expecting their first child , the government has published legislation which it hopes to rush through before @entity49			2
deputy prime minister @entity50 said : ‘ this bill will bring to an end centuries of discrimination against women so that the first born is next in line to the throne , regardless of whether they ’re a boy or a girl			1
‘ i ’m delighted that all of the @entity14 ’s realms have agreed to this historic piece of legislation , that will enact in law what we agreed back in 2011 – that if the @entity3 and @entity4 have a baby girl , she can one day be our queen even if she has younger brothers			1
‘ we ’re pressing ahead with this as quickly as we can – it ’s clearly something the entire country can get behind towards the close of this momentous jubilee year			0
’ the four - page @entity75 states that in future ‘ succession to the @entity83 not to depend on gender ’ and rewrites the @entity76 to replace ‘ first son and heir ’ to mean ‘ eldest child and heir ’			0
other laws affected include the @entity85 , @entity86 and the @entity87			2
the baby will be third in line to the throne regardless of gender after prime minister @entity91 agreed a deal with other @entity40 countries to change the rules on the royal line of succession which means male heirs will no longer be given priority			1
this means that in the 15 other countries where the @entity14 is head of state the rules must be changed			0
it had been feared there could be a constitutional crisis if the royal couple had a baby girl before the law was changed			0
but today 's announcement that the @entity4 is expecting the couple 's first child - third in line to the throne - has come after the deal was agreed			0
in october 2011 , @entity91 announced that the 16 @entity40 countries where the @entity14 is head of state had agreed to give female royals the same rights of succession as their brothers			1
' put simply , if the @entity3 and @entity4 were to have a little girl , that girl would one day be our queen , ' mr @entity91 said			0
under the ancient rules of male primogeniture , first born royal daughters in direct line to the throne were leapfrogged by their younger male siblings			2
deputy prime minister @entity50 said the legislation would be passed ' as quickly as we can ' the principle was criticised and widely viewed as outdated and discriminatory			1
the current law of male primogeniture only allows @entity14 to be queen because she did not have any brothers			0
moves towards constitutional change gathered pace in the wake of the @entity3 and @entity4 ’s wedding in april 2011 in anticipation they would produce an offspring			0
mr @entity91 had previously warned it would take time due to on - going negotiations with the @entity40 countries where the @entity14 is also head of state , but at the @entity143 in october 2011 he confirmed the changes would go ahead			1
@entity145 said any attempt to alter the law would be a ' difficult and complex matter ' , with parallel legislation needed in all such @entity40 nations			2
the @entity3 and @entity4 of @entity6 's first child will push prince @entity152 into fourth place in the line of succession to the throne - even if they have a girl			1
prince @entity46 and @entity4 's child would move into third place , become more important than @entity152 and not be subject to the centuries - old law of primogeniture , which puts male heirs ahead of women			1
he or she will leapfrog @entity152 by being be the first born of first - in - line prince @entity166 's first son			2
it is anticipated that @entity152 and @entity168 could be asked to be the child 's godparents , if the royal couple follow the tradition appointing the best man and maid of honour from their wedding			0
ministers have made clear the changes will apply from october 28 , 2011 – the date of the @entity40 summit where the countries agreed the plans			1
so close : @entity184 of @entity6 , ( centre ) , prince @entity46 ( right ) and @entity152 ( left ) wave as they pass the @entity188 during the @entity189 in june the change needs to be legislated for in the @entity40 nations of the @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 , the @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 , @entity205 , the @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and the @entity209 and @entity210			1
but this is regarded as assured .			0

a week after @entity214 left hospital , minister publish @entity85
@entity50 says legislation will be passed ' as quickly as we can '
@entity40 countries have agreed changes to line of succession rules
the law of primogeniture had once meant boys leapfrogged older sisters
new baby would be in third place by becoming more important than @entity152
