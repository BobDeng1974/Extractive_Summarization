@entity0 now manufactures more than it did in the late 1970s , shattering the idea that as a nation we do not make anything any more			1
output last year was 10 per cent higher than in 1978 , a new study by the @entity6 said			1
however , the proportion of people working in manufacturing has fallen sharply , down from 25 per cent 35 years ago to just 8 per cent now			0
a new study by the @entity6 reveals manufacturing output has risen since 1978 , but the workforce has shrunk productivity in manufacturing has also risen sharply since 1948 , much faster than the service sector the number of jobs in manufacturing has fallen by 61.2 per cent between 1979 and 2013 , the report showed the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) said workers in the sector were significantly better skilled and more experienced , even though only 8 per cent of @entity0 jobs are now in manufacturing , compared with 25 per cent in 1978			1
perceptions that manufacturing is disappearing from this country are ' wide of the mark ' , said the @entity6			1
productivity has grown by 2.8 per cent a year since 1948 despite the fall in jobs , which has partly been caused by outsourcing			2
the textile industry suffered an 80 per cent fall in jobs between 1979 and 2013 , compared to a cut of 40 per cent in wood and paper			0
@entity38 , chief economist at the @entity6 , said : ' the manufacturing industry has changed markedly over the past 60 years			1
' it is becoming more productive , despite a steady fall in the number of people employed and broadly stable capital stock , and economic downturns in the 1970s , early 1990s , and notably 2008 - 9			0
' there are several factors at work : a better quality and more skilled workforce ; a shift from the production of low to high productivity goods ; an improvement in the information technology base ; more investment in research and development and a more integrated global economy			0
' exporting firms generally are associated with higher productivity and foreign - owned firms in the @entity0 generally experience higher productivity than domestic firms			2
' the @entity65 is the biggest importer of @entity0 - made goods , worth £ 32billion - a - year the @entity68 is responsible for the biggest slice of manufacturing output , with @entity71 and @entity72 the lowest the report revealed how the @entity65 is the biggest importer of @entity0 - made goods , worth £ 32billion - a - year			1

business secretary @entity79 said : ' a strong manufacturing sector is vital to a balanced economic recovery			0
this report shows that recent pessimism about manufacturing has been misplaced : across @entity0 industry , more cars are rolling off the production line , @entity0 - made engines are keeping planes in the air and manufacturing is coming back from abroad			1
' our industrial strategy is paying dividends by giving business the confidence to invest and pave the way to recovery			0
we will continue to support businesses to secure more highly skilled jobs and a stronger economy			0
' @entity102 , chief economist at @entity103 , the manufacturers ' organisation , said : ' this analysis shows us exactly why @entity0 manufacturing must be at the centre of a better - balanced economy			1
' its declining share of employment and output is only a small part of the story as industry generates skilled jobs , productivity growth and the innovation and investment that can help to boost @entity0 competitiveness			2
' while this is a story of the past , the right business environment for manufacturing and a focus on rebalancing will ensure the sector continues to have a positive impact on the @entity0 economy			2
