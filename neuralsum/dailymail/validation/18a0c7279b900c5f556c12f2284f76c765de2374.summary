the probe into an alleged paedophile network at the heart of the @entity3 took an explosive turn last night with the revelation that @entity7 ’s name has been passed to police			1
the @entity9 can reveal that the late @entity11 mp , one of the most prominent and divisive politicians of the @entity13 , has been named to @entity14 by the @entity15			1
the claims relate to ‘ ritual satanic abuse ’			0
and in a further development to the sex - ring investigations , police are to be given access to secret files held on mps in the @entity24 archives as they hunt for evidence on suspected abusers , including former @entity10 mp @entity27			0
the claim is being examined by @entity39 , one of a number of police probes into ‘ establishment paedophile rings ’ – including an investigation by the @entity45 into claims that officers dropped their inquiries under pressure from powerful individuals			1
a @entity52 spokesman said : ‘ the name of @entity7 was passed to @entity39 by one of our safeguarding team on the instruction of bishop @entity31			1
' mr @entity35 is believed to have warned the @entity58 that at the time he was told of the claims against @entity7 , unsubstantiated allegations of satanic rituals – often involving the abuse of children – were widespread			2
in 1994 , an investigation by the @entity65 into 84 alleged cases of ‘ satanic abuse ’ in the @entity68 between 1987 and 1992 , including notorious cases in @entity70 and the @entity71 that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids , found no convincing corroborative evidence			0
report : @entity31 , the @entity15 , passed the name to @entity14 after hearing it from the former bishop of @entity82 however , the ongoing scandal over how serial paedophile @entity84 was able to evade detection for decades has led institutions to take a safety - first approach , so the @entity52 felt it had no option but to pass on the information to police			1
@entity7 ’s frontline political career ended abruptly in 1968 after he made his infamous ‘ rivers of blood ’ speech warning about the dangers of uncontrolled immigration			1
@entity11 leader @entity98 sacked him from the @entity99 the following day , although @entity7 remained an mp until 1974			2
shortly after he died in 1998 , aged 85 , it was revealed he had admitted to a friend , @entity102 @entity101 , that love poetry he had written as a youth had been intended for a man – but that he did not want the fact revealed while he was alive			0
although @entity7 became a hero of the @entity111 , his intellectual and oratorical skills earned him admirers on both sides of the political divide			0
a devout member of the @entity52 , he had two daughters with his wife @entity117			0
sources close to one of @entity14 ’s sex - ring investigations say officers contacted @entity122 , the @entity123 at arms – the @entity125 ’ most senior security official – earlier this month to ask him to search the files kept on all mps			2
it is understood that no information was uncovered implicating mps in abuse , sparking fears at @entity14 that some of the evidence might have been shredded			0
now mr @entity122 is believed to have told officers that , if they produce a warrant , they can enter the commons to investigate the files themselves on a ‘ case by case basis ’			0
last night , @entity142 , @entity7 ’s official biographer and former confidante , branded the allegations ‘ absolute nonsense ’ and without foundation .			1
