by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 08:41 est , 10 september 2013 prince @entity1 , wearing a blanket to keep warm , arrives at the @entity3 in @entity4 in 2010 after a particularly trying day , some of us might unwind with a cup of tea or a hot bath			1
but prince @entity1 , it seems , has a slightly wilder solution			1
the @entity12 has revealed he listens to animal noises on his iphone to relax – inspired by the love of @entity16 he inherited from his mother			1
while his father @entity19 has admitted he talks to plants while indulging in a little gardening , @entity1 confessed to having several hundred sound effects – such as crickets and buffalos – on his mobile phone , which remind him of the country where he proposed to wife @entity27			1
in an interview about his love for @entity16 and his charity work there , prince @entity1 said : ‘ i regularly daydream			1
' @entity16 is definitely one of the places i go to ... i have hundreds of animals on my @entity14			1
so if i am ever having quite a stressful day ... you can put a buffalo on in the background or a cricket			2
‘ it takes you back instantly to the bush			0
and it does completely settle me down			0
’ prince @entity1 revealed how his mother @entity41 inspired his passion , saying her ‘ infectious enthusiasm and energy ’ for @entity16 and its people could not fail to rub off on him			1
he said : ‘ she would come back with all these stories and full of excitement and just passion for what she had been doing and i sort of used to sit there , quite a sort of surprised little boy at the time , taking it all in			2
’ and his connection to the continent is so strong that he chose to propose while on holiday in @entity57 in 2010			0
he said : ‘ i did n’t really plan it that far in advance			0
i just knew i wanted it to feel comfortable where i did it and i wanted it to mean something , other than just the act of getting engaged			0
‘ [ @entity27 ] understands what it means to me being in @entity16			1
’ @entity1 was speaking in a documentary , prince @entity1 ’s passion : new father , @entity70 , which looks at his commitment to conservation in @entity16			1
the prince , who is royal patron of conservation organisation @entity74 , said his ‘ protective ’ instinct has kicked in since the birth of @entity77 in july			2
he said he has been spurred on to do more to protect ‘ vulnerable ’ wildlife , such as cheetahs , one of his favourite animals			0
he said : ‘ suddenly you start thinking of like , wow , there is stuff you want to safeguard for the future			0
i ’ve always believed it , but to actually really feel it as well , it ’s coming through powerfully now as well			0
’ he also revealed how he has become more emotional since the birth of his son			2
listen up : @entity1 plays buffalo cries to help him ' settle down ' and relax prince @entity1 is following in the footsteps of both of his parents in terms of his love for @entity16 , but particularly @entity19 who fell for the continent partly thanks to his close friendship with @entity99 writer @entity98			1
it was even once reported that @entity98 , @entity19 's spiritual guru , taught the @entity1 how to talk to plants			1
when @entity19 and @entity41 announced who would be godparents of prince @entity1 , it was prince @entity19 ' spiritual guru who made the cut			1
sir @entity98 was a @entity99 writer and long time friend of the @entity108 's family , the @entity107			0
he grew up on a @entity99 farm in @entity110 but emigrated to @entity111 when he was 21			0
despite this , his heart remained in @entity16 and 11 of his 20 books are about the continent			2
@entity98 died in 1996 aged 90 but his legacy seems to be living on in the two princes			0
‘ the last few weeks have been a very different emotional experience – something i never thought i would feel for myself , ’ he said			2
‘ i find , even though it ’s only been a short period , that a lot of things affect me now			0
’ in the interview , @entity1 admitted that his visits to @entity16 help him to indulge the side of his character that craves a sense of normality , away from the maelstrom of royal life			1
‘ it ’s escaping to a kind of different world where i am just who i normally am anyway , and i can let that side , that sort of slightly immature , silly person come out a bit more than i normally do , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s not sycophants or anything like that			0
you ’re very much treated as one of the team , and if you ’re not pulling your weight , you ’re told to man up and get on with it			0
’ but he might have to wait a while for his next trip to @entity16			2
‘ i think as soon as @entity151 grows up a little bit more [ i ’ll go ] , ’ he said , before joking : ‘ i will be hung [ sic ] if i go now ... [ but ] it ’s definitely a plan of mine to go back			0
’ the @entity12 and @entity27 will make their first red carpet appearance together since the birth of their son on thursday at the @entity74 ’s @entity158 in @entity111 , where the @entity12 will present the @entity159 in @entity16			1
