@entity0 and @entity1 have joined a long list of the world 's largest retailers who will not be accepting @entity5			1
at its launch , @entity5 boasted there are 200,000 retail stores now ready and willing to let you give them your cash using just a flick of your @entity13 and a tap of your finger to prove your identity			2
but retail giants @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 's			1
@entity21 are not among them			0
these retail giants and dozens more are part of a group developing their own mobile payment scheme			1
it comes after the system hit several glitches following its launch last week			0
some @entity5 users in the @entity38 have been double - charged for purchases			1
the @entity62 tech giant has admitted there is a problem with its mobile payment system , but says it only affected ‘ a very small number ’ of @entity5 users with @entity67 accounts , and is working to refund all faulty transactions			1
@entity0 and @entity1 initially accepted @entity5 , but quickly turned heel and no longer take the payment system			1
the chains disabled the system in their stores over the weekend , reports the @entity76			2
the retailer group to which both companies belong , the @entity32 ( @entity79 ) , is creating @entity80 -- a system similar to @entity5 that will be owned by a consortium of retailers rather than a third party , i.e. @entity5			1
like @entity5 , @entity85 allows consumers to quickly and securely pay for goods and services with the aid of an app on their cell phones			1
obstacles : @entity5 lets users pay with their phones at some 200,000 retail stores			1
consumers may use whatever credit cards they 'd like			0
while the system appears seamless , retailer opposition is a serious hurdle for the @entity102 giant @entity5 is compatible with the @entity13 , @entity103 and the @entity104			1
the mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the @entity110 button			2
this confirms the person 's identity , and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card			2
all details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely			2
if an @entity13 is lost , users can suspend all payments via the find my @entity13 service			0
@entity85 , however , appears to work in an opposite way from @entity5			2
while the former uses what 's called an @entity130 chip , which is scanned by the retail kiosk , the @entity79 system has the phone scan a code generated by the kiosk			2
not only is @entity85 hoping to leave @entity5 out in the cold , it 's trying to circumvent credit cards completely			1
while @entity5 allows users to store whatever credit cards they 'd like in their phones , @entity85 taps directly into the user 's bank account			1
results , though , are the same : a seamless and safe purchasing process			0
@entity85 is set to hit smartphones in 2015			0
@entity5 said it had found most retailers were enthusiastic			2
' the feedback we are getting from customers and retailers about @entity5 is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic , ' it told @entity150			1
' we are working to get as many merchants as possible to support this convenient , secure and private payment option for consumers			0
' many retailers have already seen the benefits and are delighting their customers at over 220,000 locations			0
@entity5 ( screenshots pictured above ) stores @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 credit card information and works with the @entity13 6 's @entity110 fingerprint recognition system so users can touch their phone on a contactless reader to pay for goods			1
stores such as @entity169 , @entity170 's and @entity171 involved and that may be @entity5 's one advantage , it 's pay system is already here			1
@entity5 made its debut last week			2
now you can flash your new @entity13 in the checkout line to pay for food , clothing and other goods			0
there 's no need to pull out your credit card			0
but do n't leave your wallet or purse behind quite yet : despite a few dozen retail chains pledging support for @entity5 , so - called contactless payments are still new			1
smaller merchants , in particular , are n't likely to have the necessary equipment right away			0
all told , there are more than 200,000 payment terminals that should accept @entity5 in the @entity38 @entity5 has announced about two dozen leading retail chains accepting @entity5 at launch , and others are planning to do so by the end of the year			1
@entity5 said it has worked with several retailers to make sure most of their stores , if not all of them , were ready at monday 's launch : @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 's , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 retail stores including @entity209 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity213 , @entity213 , @entity170 , @entity169 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , run by @entity213 , six : 02 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity205 , unleashed by @entity218 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225			1
bright side : dozens of retailers will be accepting @entity5 , the biggest of which include @entity222 , @entity229 , @entity223 , @entity169 and @entity170 's @entity5 also said that the following merchants plan to add support by the end of the year : @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237			1
for online payments , @entity5 said the following merchants have apps ready for @entity5 : @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity217 , @entity248 , @entity235 , @entity19 and @entity249			1
others expected by year 's end include : @entity251 , @entity211 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 by @entity255 , @entity234 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259			0
of course , @entity5 's retail stores and the @entity262 app will also take @entity5			1
@entity5 is designed to protect the user 's personal information			1
it does n't collect any transaction information that can be tied back to a user and payment transactions are between the user , the merchant and the user 's bank			2
@entity5 does n't collect its users ' purchase history , so when they are shopping in a store or restaurant it does n't know what they bought , where they bought it or how much they paid for it			2
card numbers are not stored on the device , instead , a unique @entity278 is created , encrypted and stored in the @entity281 of the device			0
the @entity278 in the @entity281 is walled off from @entity283 and not backed up to @entity284			0
users can make purchases in stores and within apps , with credit cards issued by many @entity38 banks , which make up 83 percent of the credit card purchase volume in the country			0
the mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the @entity110 button			2
the @entity130 chip is fitted across the top of the phone			0
all details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely			0
it uses the @entity305 app and cards that are already on file with @entity308 can be saved to it			0
users can also take a picture of their own credit card and add it to the account			0
this is verified by the card 's bank before being accepted			0
if an @entity13 is lost , users can suspend all payments via the find my @entity13 service			0
this wo n't cancel the cards , either , because the card details themselves are not stored on that device			0
@entity5 said it is ' working hard ' on bringing it to the @entity325 , although a date has yet to be announced			0

@entity5 's mobile payment system is not being accepted at the drug store chains
neither are @entity18 , @entity41 , @entity40 's , @entity42 , @entity19 or dozens of other giants
@entity0 and @entity1 are part of the @entity32 , a group developing its own payment system using cell phones
comes after some customers were double charged for payments using the new system
