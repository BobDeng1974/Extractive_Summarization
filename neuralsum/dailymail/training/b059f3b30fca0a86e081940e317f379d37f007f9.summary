a very @entity1 problem of a leaky church roof could be about to give the world the chance to glimpse the legendary @entity5			1
that 's because the claimed home of the iconic relic - a small chapel in @entity10 - has sprung a leak and so the @entity5 could now be on the move			1
the @entity5 - which the @entity13 says holds @entity15 's @entity14 given to @entity16 on @entity17 - is said to have been kept in @entity18 , in the @entity19 , adjacent to @entity20 , since the 1960s			1
according to the @entity21 , it was first kept in the @entity22 in @entity23 for centuries until a @entity26 invasion in the 6th century @entity27 leaking roof : the @entity19 in @entity10 that holds the @entity14 and has the water damage			1
the @entity30 , that originally held the tablet , can be seen in the foreground since then it 's been the goal of many adventurers and archaeologists to find it			0
most - famously , but also fictitiously , @entity38 was shown in the 1981 @entity40 film raiders of the @entity41 there has also been a long - running claim from the @entity44 of @entity10 that they have had the @entity5 for centuries , and since the 1960s it has apparently been kept in the chapel			1
this small and curiously - styled building is surrounded by spiked iron railings , and situated between two churches , the old and new , of @entity20 in central @entity18			0
no one has been allowed to see the holy object , described in scripture as being made from acacia wood , plated with gold and topped with two golden angels , except one solitary elderly monk , who must watch over the @entity5 for the remainder of his life , and is never allowed to leave the chapel grounds			1
but now the chapel - which was designed by the @entity10 leader emperor @entity62 - has had to be covered in a tarpaulin to stop rain getting in			0
the water damage could mean the @entity5 will be moved for the first time in decades giving religious worshippers and adventurers alike a chance to see it			2
@entity1 photographer @entity70 , 54 , who is a travel photographer for publications like @entity73 , discovered the church had sprung a leak whilst travelling through @entity10 last september			0
holy work : workmen clear the ground adjacent to the @entity19			0
right , paintings in the old church of @entity20 and the covered entrance to the inner chapel he believes the moving of the @entity5 could be one of the best ways to discover if there 's any truth in the claims of the @entity90 state			2
@entity70 said : ' during my most recent visit to the church , i was surprised to see some ground adjacent to the '' @entity19 '' being cleared and levelled by workmen , and some quantities of building stone being assembled nearby			0
' asking around , i managed to discover that a new temporary chapel is due to be built , and the @entity5 is to be moved into it while the original chapel is repaired			2
' it seems that the builders of the 1960s were not as careful as the builders of centuries past , and the roof of the chapel has developed some serious leaks that now need comprehensive repair work			0
@entity38 , right , carries away the glistening @entity5 in the 1981 film @entity41 by @entity40 ' to protect the @entity5 , a tarpaulin now covers the roof of the chapel but this is just a temporary measure			2
' to renovate the building thoroughly , the roof must be stripped back to the bare bones and so a replacement chapel is to be built next door providing a temporary home for it			0
' @entity70 said the construction of the new temporary chapel would take about three months according to workers and religious figures at the site , though he suspects that it will probably take much longer			0
he added : ' when the work is finished , the @entity5 will be carried to its new resting place			0
' ' that this can be done by the one person allowed to see it is unlikely , as @entity13 describes the size of the @entity5 as 2.5 cubits in length , 1.5 in breadth , and 1.5 in height			1
' @entity134 in today 's measurements translate to about 1.31 metres x 0.79m x 0.79m and it is normally carried on two long wooden poles			1
' if it really is this size , and still contains the two stone tablets that list @entity15 's @entity14 , then the elderly monk will no doubt need some help to transport it			1

@entity5 contains @entity14 @entity15 ' gave ' to @entity16 on @entity17
one holy monk is the only person allowed to see the holy *box* **...**
**...** but he *'ll* need a hand carrying metre long wooden structure to new home
