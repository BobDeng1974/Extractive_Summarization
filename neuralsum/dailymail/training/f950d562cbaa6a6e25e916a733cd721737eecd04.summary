the @entity0 has long been described as an ethnic melting pot - but researchers have created maps showing how the genetic ancestry of @entity6 changes from state to state			1
the new @entity9 study used data from @entity11 , a @entity13 - backed genetic testing firm			1
researchers analyzed the genomes of more than 160,000 @entity6 , latinos , and @entity17 , providing novel insights into the subtle differences in genetic ancestry across the @entity0			1
the map reveals where self identified white @entity6 with @entity25 ancestry are most likely to live researchers analyzed dna sequence variations called single - nucleotide polymorphisms in the genomes of 5,269 self - described @entity6 , 8,663 latinos , and 148,789 @entity17			1
these individuals actively participate in @entity11 research by submitting saliva samples , consenting for data to be used for research , and completing surveys			2
@entity11 is a personal genomics company that provides direct - to - consumer genetic testing and services that include the analysis of dna samples to generate ancestry - related genetic reports			1
' our study not only reveals the historical underpinnings of regional differences in genetic ancestry but also sheds light on the complex relationships between genetic ancestry and self - identified race and ethnicity , ' said lead author @entity52 of @entity11 and @entity53			2
over the past 500 years , @entity54 has been the site of ongoing mixing of @entity57 , @entity17 settlers , and @entity59			0
although much of the world has been genetically characterized , the @entity0 has received less attention from population geneticists because of its complex ancestry patterns			0
moreover , the relationship between genetic ancestry and self - described racial and ethnic identities in each region of the @entity0 has not been deeply characterized			2
to address this gap in knowledge , @entity52 and her collaborators analyzed dna sequence variations called single - nucleotide polymorphisms in the genomes of 5,269 self - described @entity6 , 8,663 latinos , and 148,789 @entity17			1
the researchers found that regional ancestry differences reflect historical events such as waves of immigration			0
for example , @entity82 ancestry is found in trace proportions in most states but comprises about 10 % of ancestry in @entity17 living in @entity87 and the @entity88			1
they also found that individuals identify roughly with the majority of their genetic ancestry , contrary to expectations under a social ' one - drop rule			0
' indeed , more than six million @entity6 who self - identify as @entity17 might carry @entity25 ancestry , and as many as five million self - described @entity17 might have at least 1 % @entity97 ancestry			1
' these findings suggest that many individuals with partial @entity25 and @entity97 ancestry have ' passed ' into the white community , thereby undermining the use of cultural labels that separate individuals into discrete , non-overlapping groups , ' @entity52 says			0
' taken together , our results suggest that genetic ancestry can be leveraged to augment historical records and inform cultural processes shaping modern populations			0
' these individuals actively participate in @entity11 research by submitting saliva samples , consenting for data to be used for research , and completing surveys for the study , published in the @entity119 , @entity11 is a personal genomics company that provides direct - to - consumer genetic testing and services that include the analysis of dna samples to generate ancestry - related genetic reports			1
the second map reveals the mean proportion of @entity128			0
@entity6 in @entity129 and @entity130 have the highest average percentage of @entity25 ancestry of @entity6 in the @entity0			1
among her findings were that about 3.5 percent of self - identified @entity17 @entity6 have at least 1 percent or more @entity25 ancestry			1
it 's likely that many of these @entity6 , who describe themselves as white , may be unaware of their @entity25 ancestry , which in many cases goes back between five to ten generations			1
there are also differences regionally — with the highest levels in the @entity130 — so that in @entity130 , at least 13 percent of self - identified whites have 1 percent or more @entity25 ancestry , while in @entity147 the number is a little more than 12 percent			1
in @entity129 and @entity149 the number is about 9 percent			0
' the differences perhaps point to different social and cultural histories within the @entity152 , ' @entity11 said			0
@entity154 's study also found that one in every @entity155 have @entity97 ancestry , while in @entity157 14 percent of @entity6 carry at least two percent @entity97 ancestry			2
all three groups - @entity6 , @entity17 @entity6 and @entity160 - have ancestry from @entity25 , @entity162 and the @entity163			1
approximately 3.5 percent of @entity17 have one percent or more @entity25 ancestry			2
many of these @entity17 who describe themselves as ' white ' may be unaware of their @entity25 ancestry since the @entity25 ancestor may be five to 10 generations in the past			1
@entity17 with @entity25 ancestry are found at much higher frequencies in southern states than in other parts of the @entity0			2
the ancestry proportions point to the different regional impacts of slavery , immigration , migration and colonization within the @entity0 : the highest levels of @entity25 ancestry among self - reported @entity6 are found in southern states , especially @entity130 and @entity129			1
one in every 20 @entity6 carries @entity97 ancestry			0
more than 14 percent of @entity6 from @entity157 carry at least two percent @entity97 ancestry , likely reflecting the @entity184 migration following the @entity185 of 1830			0
among self - reported @entity160 in the @entity0 , those from states in the southwest , especially from states bordering @entity189 , have the highest levels of @entity97 ancestry			0
among self - reported @entity160 in the @entity0 , those from states in the southwest , especially from states bordering @entity189 , have the highest levels of @entity97 ancestry			0
but among @entity160 too there were wide regional differences that also likely reflect the history of migration and intermixing			0
for example , some @entity160 have no discernible @entity97 ancestry , while others have as much as 50 percent of their ancestry being @entity97			0
latinos in states in the @entity204 , bordering @entity189 — @entity189 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 — have the greatest percentage of @entity97 ancestry			0
latinos in states with the largest proportion of @entity6 in their population — @entity130 , @entity147 and @entity149 — have the highest percentage of @entity213			2
all three groups – @entity6 , @entity17 @entity6 and @entity160 – showed asymmetrical male and female ancestry contributions , with more @entity17 male and more @entity97 and @entity25 female ancestors			2
this asymmetry is likely a legacy of slavery , unbalanced sex ratios in frontier settings , as well other social factors .			0
