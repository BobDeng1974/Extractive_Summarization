more than a dozen dangerous offenders committed terrorism offences while on bail , including jihadist @entity3 who fled to @entity4 while on bail for a spate of violent muggings in @entity8 more than a dozen dangerous offenders committed terrorism offences while on bail , damning figures have revealed			1
in the last three years , 13 suspects allowed to walk free for other offences were arrested for breaching anti-terror laws			1
the figures , obtained by @entity16 , also show the shocking scale of offences committed by suspects on bail , with one crime every five minutes			1
it is likely that the 13 terrorists were allowed to walk free after committing minor crimes before then being caught endangering national security , legal experts say			0
the staggering figures , released by the @entity28 under @entity29 , show that nearly 350,000 offences were committed on bail in the last three years			1
this equates to one offence every five minutes - sparking yet more fears about the state of @entity37 's justice system			1
the statistics raise further questions over the monitoring of terror suspects , such as jihadist @entity3 , who fled to @entity4 in 2012 while he was on bail for a spate of violent muggings in @entity8			1
@entity3 , 22 , threatened victims with a taser - style high - voltage stun gun and forced them to hand over valuables including designer watches and mobile phones , but fled the country before he could face trial			1
he is believed to have been two years below @entity52 - revealed last week to be @entity53 - at @entity54 in north west @entity8 and was killed in 2013 near the city of @entity56			1
@entity52 was himself on a terror watch list when he travelled to @entity4 and the government has admitted that hundreds of @entity60 extremists ' slipped through the net ' and were not properly monitored by the security services			0
the figures also make for a chilling comparison to @entity66 siege gunman man @entity65 , who was on bail in @entity68 when he took 17 hostages captive in a cafe before killing two			2
@entity72 mp @entity71 , a member of the @entity73 , said : ' any hint that someone may be involved in terrorism and who is facing criminal charges must be remanded in prison - no ifs no buts			2
' we have to accept that bail conditions are not tough enough , leaving those with criminal intent to wander our streets			2
' if courts are not going to remand defendants in jail then we should at least place them under 24 - hour house arrest using electronic tagging to keep them at home rather than free to commit crime			1
' @entity3 ( right ) was killed near @entity56 in 2013 alongside @entity95 , from west @entity8 ( left ) magistrates have been under mounting pressure in recent years to remand fewer suspects into custody to ease the burden on over-stretched prisons			1
@entity102 , criminal defence lawyer at @entity103 , said : ' people who have gone on to commit terror offences while on bail would not have been on bail for terror offences or anything in the same category of seriousness			2
' if there was any clue to the court granting bail that there was a risk of something of this nature , bail would not have been granted			0
' there 's a presumption that bail must be sought in all cases except the most serious			0
the idea of someone having their liberty taken away on suspicion of a minor offence is seen as unconstitutional			0
' @entity129 , director of the think - tank @entity130 , said : ' the impression the government is giving is that they are trying to save money by reducing the prison population by giving bail			2
' there are many reasons for not giving bail , but often they are very simply ignored by the courts			0
' magistrates , who are possibly under pressure to keep the prison population down , are endangering public safety for the sake of a few pounds			0
' a @entity28 spokesman said : ' we have already changed the law to allow prosecutors to challenge a @entity152 bail decision where they feel a potentially dangerous prisoner could be bailed			0
' the overwhelming majority of people bailed do not re-offend and they are often given strict conditions such as tags and curfews			0
' @entity159 was murdered by her ex-boyfriend @entity160 while he was on bail for raping her the shock terror figures come just weeks after it was revealed that one in nine victims of murder or manslaughter were killed by someone on bail			1
@entity170 , the father of 26 - year - old @entity159 who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend @entity160 while he was on bail for raping her , said the sheer scale of offences showed change was needed			1
mr @entity170 , who runs the justice for @entity159 campaign , said : ' victims ' rights of safety should come ahead of suspects ' liberties			2
' i do n't think the courts take bail seriously enough			0
judges should be held accountable and there should be consequences for poor decisions			0
' in just one year , there were 57 unlawful killings – more than one a week – by suspects allowed to walk free while awaiting trial for other crimes			0
offenders on bail also committed an average of two rapes a week and a sex assault on a child almost every two days			1
in one case a girl of 16 was raped by a pervert who was on bail following an attack on another teenager			0
critics said the figures proved that too many dangerous criminals were being released until their trial date – despite the risk to the community			0
@entity72 mp @entity213 , a member of the @entity214 , said : ‘ these shocking figures indicate how important it is that our judges remember that before granting a suspect bail they consider the risk posed to the general public , including children			1
this is a truly terrible toll			0
’ there were 125 rapes by those on bail from june 2011 to june 2012 , with this figure falling to 101 and 81 in the two following years			2
the number of sex offences against children by those on bail stands at 134 in the last year the @entity28 could provide figures for , falling from 182 three years ago			1
meanwhile more than 22,000 violent crimes were committed on bail in the last three years			1
the figures include the appalling case of @entity239 , a jobless misfit , who was out on bail for the alleged rape of a girl of 16 when he raped a second teenager in october 2013			2
he was handed an 18 - year jail sentence at @entity246 last february .			0
