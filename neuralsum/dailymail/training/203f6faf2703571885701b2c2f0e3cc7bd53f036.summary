primitive organisms may have existed on @entity1 during a period when life was forming on @entity4			2
this is according to a recent study by @entity7 which suggests @entity1 may have been capable of supporting microbial life for hundreds of millions of years			2
opportunity , which celebrates 10 years of @entity1 exploration today , has uncovered evidence that benign , neutral - @entity13 water flowed on @entity1 around four billion years ago			1
the rover 's panoramic camera ( @entity21 ) took the images opportunity landed on @entity1 in 2004 in what was to be a three - month mission			0
instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years			2
the rover is currently at ' @entity30 ' at the rim of @entity32 on @entity1			1
the rover has n't moved in over a month as it waits for better weather on the red planet			0
during its time on @entity1 , the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals			0
their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water			0
the evidence comes from samples from the rim of a 3.7 billion year old crater , named @entity32 , and is believed to be the earliest evidence of water activity yet discovered			1
opportunity investigated the rocks at a spot dubbed @entity56			0
the samples revealed a type of clay that commonly forms on @entity4 when water flows through fractures in the rock			0
the finding adds to the more - recent @entity64 mission , which found evidence of ancient habitability 3.5 billion years ago			1
‘ these [ benign ] water conditions existed over a long period of time , ’ @entity67 , lead author of the new study and @entity7 deputy principal investigator told @entity70			1
scientists believe that that life first started on @entity4 nearly four billion years ago			1
professor @entity67 suggests life may have been able to survive on @entity1 for longer stretches that previously believed , at a time when life was getting a foothold on our own planet			1
‘ maybe not globally , ’ he told he told @entity70			2
‘ [ habitable environments ] could have occurred here and there regionally			1
and it may not have been for the whole time continuously			0
’ opportunity touched on @entity1 ten years ago today , three weeks after its twin , @entity89			1
both robots were tasked with 90 - day missions to seek out signs of past water activity on @entity1			0
@entity89 was declared dead in 2011 , but @entity7 is still operational			0
opportunity landed on @entity1 in 2004 in what was to be a three - month mission			0
10 years later , and it is still active on the red planet			2

evidence is from the rim of a 3.7 billion year old crater named @entity32
previously @entity64 found evidence of habitability 3.5bn years ago
‘ [ habitable environments ] could have occurred here and there regionally , ' said lead author , @entity67
