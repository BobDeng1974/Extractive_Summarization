investigators said blood on the bandana led them to @entity42 , whose dna was in a national database as a result of his long criminal history			0
@entity11 's lawyer suggested to jurors that the dna evidence linking his client to the murder was contaminated			1
dna testing was n't available when the blood on the bandanna was initially tested in 1986			1
the testing was n't done until @entity20 's attorneys spent years lobbying for it			1
@entity11 , 58 , also has been indicted in a 1988 slaying of another @entity5 woman who lived near the @entity61			1
prosecutors also told jurors that a gun @entity11 stole from the @entity66 ' home and later sold linked him to the murder			2

brutal : prosecutors said @entity11 , pictured left on march 20 and right in his mugshot , beat and sexually assaulted the woman guilty : @entity35 , pictured left on march 20 , 2013 , has been convicted of murdering an @entity5 mother whose husband spent 25 years behind bars before he was exonerated of her slaying in 2011 the trial is being held in @entity10 after being moved from @entity79 , near @entity5 , because of publicity in the case			1
the @entity3 attorney general 's office handled the prosecution and was not seeking the death penalty			0
last month , a special hearing known as a court of inquiry was held to examine whether state district judge @entity88 acted improperly in 1987 when , as @entity79 district attorney , he prosecuted @entity20			1
@entity20 's lawyers have accused @entity88 of intentionally hiding evidence			1
@entity88 has denied any wrongdoing			0
a decision by a judge on whether @entity88 should face criminal charges in the case might come next month			1
@entity88 also is being sued by the @entity97 for his conduct in the @entity20 case			2
@entity88 choked back tears on the witness stand during the special hearing as he recalled the prosecution he described as his ' worst nightmare			0
' @entity88 , who is now a judge in @entity105 near @entity5 , is accused of withholding evidence indicating @entity20 's innocence during the original trial			1
still to be sentenced : investigators said blood on the bandana led them to @entity42 , left , whose dna was in a national database as a result of his long criminal history free man : @entity20 , pictured on march 19 , attended the opening statements of the murder trial of @entity35 during days of testimony , the somber - looking @entity88 sounded a defiant note when he told the court he did nothing wrong , saying that the office he ran was professional and competent			1
then , his voice cracking , @entity88 added , ' we got it right as much as we humanly could			0
' but despite his conviction that there was no misconduct on his part , @entity88 offered an emotional apology to the wrongly convicted man			2
' i know what me and my family have been through for 18 months of false accusations , and it does n’t even register in the same ballpark of what you went through			0
' ' i do n’t know that i can say i feel your pain , but i have a pretty darn good idea how horrible what you 've gone through ... with false accusations and everything else			0
what happened to you was so much worse than that			0
i ca n't imagine what you have been feeling , ' @entity88 told @entity20 in a quiet voice , @entity151 - @entity150 reported			2
happy family : @entity20 , left , was a married grocery store manager with a child when in 1987 his wife was beaten to death he the added , ' i apologize that the system screwed up			2
i 've beaten myself up on what i could have done different and i do n't know			0
maybe the @entity42 prosecutor has something the sheriff 's office missed			0
' on his part , @entity20 has called for leniency for the man whose prosecution landed him in prison for a quarter of a century			2
in his testimony , @entity20 asked judge @entity169 to ' be gentle ' with @entity88 , explaining that he has ' a little empathy ' the former @entity171 because he knows what 's it like to have ' everybody coming after you , ' according to @entity176			1
following @entity88 's courtroom mea culpa , @entity20 said he was not expecting the encounter			1
it caught me really off guard , ' he told the @entity150			0
' i was n't prepared for it			0
i 'm sure he would completely agree , but i 'm not sure he has a complete grasp of what this is all about , not personally			0
' free at last : @entity188 speaks with @entity189 , the mother of @entity20 , right , before entering the court on the first day of the inquiry into former @entity193 @entity88 last month @entity88 , left , noted in his testimony that @entity20 , right , has been graceful towards him , even asking a judge to ' be gentle ' with the former prosecutor the february proceedings came on the heels of an admission by a juror who originally convicted @entity20 that he wished he would have had an opportunity to see police investigative files and other key evidence during the trial			1
@entity206 was jury foreman in the 1987 case that sent @entity20 to prison for life			1
@entity20 was freed on dna evidence in 2011 , and is now part of a special proceeding known as a @entity213 that will determine whether @entity88 could face criminal charges for allegedly withholding evidence			1
@entity216 testified last month that during the trial , the defense ' constantly made sure we knew that there was no hard evidence			0
' convict : @entity20 was found guilty of his wife 's murder and sentenced to life in prison ' they said , " it could have been an intruder , it could have been someone else , " ' @entity216 said			1
' i remember thinking , " wow , they created that doubt on what the possibilities were			0
" ' but , he added , @entity20 's legal team " did n't have any facts to hang " those doubts on			2
during the original case , which was tried in @entity105 , north of @entity5 , the defense objected that prosecutors were withholding evidence			2
presiding judge @entity243 ordered @entity88 to turn over case files that could contain evidence aiding @entity20 's legal team			1
@entity88 produced only a few pages of information , which @entity243 decided would n't sway the case			0
the defense and the jury never saw what @entity88 gave the judge			2
omitted from what @entity243 saw were case notes from police that the @entity259 ' three - year - old son told his grandmother he saw a ' monster , ' not his father , beating his mother			0
there was also a report from a neighbor who said she previously saw a man park a green van near the @entity20 home and head into a wooded area , as if he were casing the residence			2
when presented with those facts last month , @entity216 said , ' i wish i had been given the opportunity to know this while we were making our decision			0
' @entity216 also disputed , the theory now advanced by @entity20 's legal team , that @entity88 's co-prosecutor , @entity281 , bragged to members of the jury immediately after the case that if it had gotten a look at the police files , the defense could have used them ' to raise even more doubt			1
' rarely used , courts of inquiry can be ordered when legal officials and public servants are accused of wrongdoing			0
justice : a court of inquiry is examining whether @entity88 acted improperly in the 1987 case of @entity20 , who spent nearly 25 years in prison for killing his wife , but was exonerated in 2011 defiant : @entity88 defended his performance as @entity79 district attorney during an argument at the hearing over introducing more evidence , @entity20 's attorney @entity303 said that everything not admitted ' was like another day of freedom taken from ' @entity20			1
@entity88 attorney @entity309 slammed his hand on a table and cried , ' judge we need to stop this ! ' he yelled about ' speechmaking ' and said past courts of inquiry in @entity3 have degenerated into ' circuses ' and ' mob scenes			2
' @entity320 argued that the original trial judge was actually only seeking @entity20 's testimony to police on the day of his wife 's killing , making the rest of the case file , and police notes , irrelevant			1
he also questioned whether the defense attorney , @entity329 , vigorously sought the evidence or could be exaggerating his recollections			0
@entity332 wavered a bit , saying , ' it 's always bothered me that that would be the issue			0
how do you know what did n't happen ? ' @entity303 then asked @entity332 how he would rate his work as a defense attorney			0
the witness choked up : ' i have felt for a long time that i really let @entity19 down in some way			0
' when @entity332 left the stand , @entity20 gave him a bear - hug			0
the hearing concluded with the testimony of another former district attorney , @entity347			0
after @entity88 became a judge , it fell to @entity347 to continue overseeing the @entity20 case through the appeal process — and he argued for years against expanded dna testing , once it became available in the matter			1
@entity347 was defeated in the @entity356 primary last year , in part because of the publicity generated by @entity20 's exoneration .			2

@entity11 , 58 , convicted today of capital murder for the 1986 beating death of @entity14 , who was attacked in her north @entity5 home
he has been sentenced to life in prison
@entity20 's husband , @entity19 , was initially convicted in her death in 1987
after 25 years in prison , he was exonerated and freed in 2011 after new dna testing was done on a bloody bandanna found near the couple 's home
judge @entity88 is waiting to hear if he faces criminal charges for the wrongful conviction
