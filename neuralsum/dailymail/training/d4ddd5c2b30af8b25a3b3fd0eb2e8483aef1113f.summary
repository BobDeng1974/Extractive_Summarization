by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:29 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:56 est , 18 december 2013 @entity3 , who was convicted for murdering @entity4 , has filed an application for leave to appeal the man convicted of murdering @entity9 backpacker @entity4 in the @entity11 outback 12 years ago today launched a dramatic new move to win his freedom			1
@entity3 , now 55 , was sent to jail for life , with a minimum of 28 years , for the murder of mr @entity4 , 29 , while he was travelling through central @entity11 with his @entity9 girlfriend @entity18 , who was 28 at the time , in 2001			1
@entity3 has always insisted on his innocence - and today , through a team of lawyers , he filed an application for leave to appeal in the @entity24 in the @entity25			1
‘ the entire case against him has more holes in it than a @entity34 cheese , ’ mr @entity26 , an investigator working with @entity3 's legal team , told the @entity28			1
mr @entity4 ’s body has never been found after @entity36 told police that she and her boyfriend had been waylaid by a stranger who drove up beside them at night and indicated there was something wrong with their camper van			1
she said that when mr @entity4 went to the rear of the vehicle she heard what she thought was a gunshot			1
the stranger then partially bound her with home - made handcuffs , she said , and bundled her into his four - wheel - drive vehicle			0
but she was able to escape and hid in roadside bushes			0
it was a year before police arrested @entity3			2
but today his legal team said in the appeal papers that the prosecution had made a serious error			0
the papers allege that ‘ the crown prosecutor in the original trial , @entity65 , improperly groomed the star crown witness , @entity18 , in how to give her evidence , ’ @entity3 ’s barrister , @entity60 , @entity61 , said in a statement			1
‘ this allegation brings into question the entirety of @entity73 ’ evidence , ’ he said			0
it is understood the legal team , who have been examining every minute detail of the case against @entity3 for years , decided to strike after reading comments allegedly made by former prosecutor mr @entity80 in an interview with a @entity83 newspaper			1
@entity3 , now 55 , was sent to jail for life , with a minimum of 28 years , for the murder of mr @entity4 ( left ) , 29 , while he was travelling through central @entity11 with his @entity9 girlfriend @entity18 ( right ) , who was 28 in that article , mr @entity80 was reported to have said that he considered @entity36 a risky witness because he could never quite fathom her , not that he ever doubted her			1
he was quoted as saying : ‘ it was all explained to her : be yourself ; let it all hang out ; the jury will want to see your raw emotions			0
‘ but no. @entity98 upper - lip			0
it was not as though she was an upper - class girl - she was middle class			0
but she was not going to let these people get at her			0
’ the defence team , the @entity28 has learned , has gathered a number of witnesses who are ready to challenge scientific evidence brought against @entity3			2
among the crucial points , should @entity3 win the right to appeal , will be the credibility of dna evidence and what was found in blood that had pooled on the road where the rear of the couple ’s campervan had been parked			1
mr @entity4 's body has never been found after @entity36 told police that she and her boyfriend had been waylaid by a stranger @entity3 ’s lawyers are expected to challenge the strength of evidence that stated that it was the outback drifter ’s dna that was found on a t - shirt being worn by @entity36 on that night of july 14 , 2001			1
she claimed that @entity3 had struggled violently with her after dragging her from the campervan and had sat on her as he tried to bind her legs together			2
yet , @entity3 ’s supporters have always asked , why was only a ‘ speck ’ of @entity121 found			2
what was said to have been @entity3 ’s dna will now also come under scrutiny			2
the spreading pool of blood has also come into question by @entity136 trackers that the @entity28 spoke to in the days after the dramatic events near the hamlet of @entity139 , north of @entity140			0
after closely examining the blood they said they could not understand why there were no ants crawling on it , insisting they would have moved in on it even though it was winter time in @entity11			2
the @entity150 said there might have been ‘ something in the blood ’ that turned ants away , indicating that the pool was not fresh			0
at the time of @entity3 ’s trial , which saw him convicted in 2005 , @entity36 ’ story was questioned by his defence team			1
they asked her how she had managed to scramble from the cabin into the rear of the vehicle said to have been driven by @entity3 when the cabin was sealed and the only access to the rear was through the back entrance			0
when she told the court that perhaps she had been pushed in through the canvas sides of the four - wheel - drive , it was claimed that could not have been possible because @entity3 had erected a metal grill under the canvas as a deterrent to thieves .			0

@entity3 , convicted in 2005 , has always insisted on his innocence
