by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 03:55 est , 21 february 2013 one in 10 children is obese when they start school , say shocking new figures			1
by the time they are ready to go to senior school , the proportion has doubled to almost 20 per cent			2
overall , three in 10 boys and girls aged two to 15 are overweight or clinically obese - so fat it threatens their health			1
statistics from the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) give a snapshot of @entity16 ’s obesity epidemic in 2011			2
unhealthy : almost half of the children who were obese thought they were about the right weight it shows adults are getting even bigger , with more obese people needing hospital treatment although the trend may be ‘ flattening out ’ among children			1
in 2011/12 , 9.5 per cent of children in reception class aged four and five were classed as obese , rising to one in five pupils in year 6 aged 10 and 11			2
significantly , almost half of parents whose children are obese wrongly thought they were ‘ about the right weight ’			1
older children are more likely to be obese than younger - boys are worse than girls - but the ‘ lack of significant change in recent years suggests the trend is flattening out ’			0
but the figures show a worsening picture among adults , with a ‘ marked increase ’ in obesity over the last 20 years			1
overall , 65 per cent of men and 58 per cent of women are overweight or obese - just 37 per cent are classed as a ‘ normal ’ weight			1
in 1993 , 13 per cent of men and 16 per cent of women were obese and the figures soared to 24 per cent and 26 per cent respectively by 2011			1
there has also been a stark rise in obesity - related hospital admissions			1
obese : the study showed that 65 per cent of men were clinically obese , a significant increase over the last 20 years in 2011/12 , 11,740 people were admitted to hospitals in @entity16 because of obesity - up threefold in five years - with the number of women three times higher than men			1
stomach operations designed to help fat people lose weight also shot up , says the @entity13			2
in 2011/12 , 8,790 people underwent a procedure to help them lose weight - such as stomach stapling or a gastric bypass - a fourfold rise in five years			2
over the same period , people bought less fruit and vegetables , with fruit sales falling 4.1 per cent in 2011 compared to 2008			0
the amount of vegetables bought was 2.4 per cent lower - with a 6.6 per cent drop in fresh green vegetables			0
only 36 per cent of adults were found to take part in 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity at least once a week @entity13 chief executive @entity82 said ‘ it wo n’t have escaped the majority of people that obesity is a high profile issue in this country			2
‘ this annual report is important in bringing clarity to how this actually affects people , patients and the @entity94 , from the weighing scales to the operating theatre			0
‘ based on the @entity99 measurement , the proportion of adults estimated to be of a normal weight has dropped substantially since this report ’s time series began in 1993			0
’ @entity103 , chairman of the @entity104 , said ‘ the obesity epidemic is getting worse by the day and steadily spiralling out of control			0
’ @entity107 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) , said ‘ these figures hold a mirror to the state of the country ’s health - and it is not a flattering reflection			0
‘ the number of people who are overweight or obese is steadily climbing and unhealthy lifestyle choices are helping us along this path			1
' after our @entity122 year , it is a sad fact that only a third of us manage 30 minutes of physical activity once a week , when we should all be aiming for 150 minutes every week to keep our hearts healthy			0
‘ alarmingly , over 1 in 10 children are now classed as obese when they start school			0
we know that obese children are more likely to become obese adults , but education is the way to break this cycle			0
by teaching children about healthy eating and inspiring them to be active at a young age , we can help these kids towards a healthier future			0
’ @entity139 ’s shadow public health minister @entity138 said ‘ the government is receiving warning after warning that it has a serious crisis on its hands , and that their strategy is not working , and yet @entity146 and @entity147 are simply not listening			0
‘ these figures show @entity150 children and families paying the cost of this government ’s total lack of leadership on this growing crisis , which is storing up huge problems and costs for our @entity94 , and for the country			1

*worrying* figures show this rises to 20 ***%*** by @entity164
and that 65 ***%*** of men and 58 ***%*** of women are overweight or obese in the @entity150
number of people having weight loss surgery or being admitted to hospital *due* to obesity has also soared
