poorly pooch : four - year - old @entity4 was enjoying a walk with owner @entity6 when a @entity8 hawk swooped and attacked him mr @entity6 , 47 , from @entity18 , now faces the heartbreaking decision of whether to have @entity4 put to sleep after being told by vets that he will have to be hand - fed for the rest of his life			1
mr @entity6 , a gardener , said : ' we were enjoying a nice walk on a lovely morning , @entity4 was by my side and my other dog @entity28 , was about 10 yards ahead of us			1
' it all happened quite fast			0
i heard a scuffle and looked down and there was something big and brown attacking @entity4			2
' i thought it was another dog at first , like a @entity34 and tried to kick it but it would n’t let go			2
terrible decision : mr @entity6 , 47 , now faces the heartbreaking decision of whether to have @entity4 put to sleep after being told by vets that he will have to be hand - fed for the rest of his life ' then i saw the wings and realised it was a bird of prey			1
@entity4 was howling and he was covered in blood			2
i started crying and my clothes and my hands were covered in blood			0
' i ’m absolutely devastated			0
' mr @entity6 said his sadness soon turned to anger when he realised the hawk was not wild but being trained by a man further up the path			1
he said : ' the hawk ’s owner ran over and got the bird off @entity4 , his tongue was in his hand			1
' he had a go at me for kicking the bird			2
i could n’t believe it			0
the path is popular with dog owners , he should n’t have been there			1
' the owner said he would pay for the vets bills , but its not about the money , it ’s about @entity4			1
if another dog had attacked @entity4 , it would be almost certainly put down			1
so i want the hawk destroyed in case it attacks some other innocent animal			2
' crazed : mr @entity6 said his sadness soon turned to anger when he realised the @entity8 hawk was not wild but being trained by a man further up the path ( file picture ) mr @entity6 and @entity4 were taken to @entity79 in @entity18 by the bird ’s owner , @entity80			1
@entity4 has been in the care of vets since the attack on friday morning			2
but unless @entity4 learns to swallow his food without the use of his tongue , he will have to be hand fed meaning his quality of life will be poor			1
mr @entity6 said : ' the vets have basically said he will never be the same again			1
he had to have a lump in his mouth sewed down and half of his tonsils were taken out			0
' his quality of life is going to be low , but we ’ll just have to see how he gets on			0
he might not even be able to drink on his own so i might have to bottle feed him			0
' the attack has destroyed my life , @entity4 ’s and @entity28 ’s			2
the two dogs were best of friends and you can tell @entity28 is missing him			0
' @entity18 council worker @entity80 said the attack was an ‘ unfortunate accident ’ and said that he would respect any request to have the one - year - old hawk put down			2
' i let her loose and she left her perch in a tree and flew over to his direction			0
she went on to the dog and i managed to get her off and separated them			0
' it was quite a nasty injury , this chap was understandably jumping up and down			0
i explained that the bird was insured and he did n’t have to worry , and that the vet care will be dealt with			0
' she has never attacked a dog or anyone i have been out with before			0
maybe she caught a flash in the long grass and thought it was a rabbit			0
' he added : ' if he wants the bird destroyed it ’s up to him			0
