@entity0 showed up to @entity1 on wednesday to give an emotional address about alzheimer 's disease , but his sadness soon turned to ire as he watched @entity6 members leave the already nearly empty hearing			1
' all those empty seats are senators who are not prioritizing @entity10 's , ' the normally jovial @entity0 tweeted following the hearing			1
he followed up his speech with an appearance on @entity14 in which he again called out the 16 senators who ducked out early or failed to even show up to his speech			1
he even watched some of them leave ' it 's indicative of a mentality that we find so frustrating			0
it seems like these people do n't care , ' he told host @entity39			0
making the poor showing by the all the @entity42 on @entity44 members more offensive was how one of his central issues was of the ignorance and even shame surrounding the disease			0
@entity0 said he even watched as many of the committee members stood and left before he addressed them			1
in a particularly confounding move , senator @entity51 even tweeted at @entity0 thanking him for his speech			1
' thanks to @entity54 for speaking out about efforts to # @entity56			0
@entity59 if you know someone affected by # @entity10 , ' wrote the @entity60 @entity30			1
oops : senator @entity51 had the nerve to thank @entity0 for his speech and even tweeted out a photo of himself with the actor , but did n't stay for the speech lashing out : @entity0 was a charmer while he addressed the mere two senators who stuck around to hear him , but afterwards he made his true feelings known only he did n't see it			1
at least not in person			0
why did you leave before my speech ? just curious , ' @entity0 shot back			2
if the actor seems touchy , it 's because the issue hits very close to home for him			2
@entity0 ’s mother - in - law @entity80 was diagnosed with the disease very early and the 31 - year - old actor told the @entity83 on @entity44 , @entity84 , and @entity85 how his view of the devastating illness changed as he watched her slowly lose the ability to care for herself			1
the @entity90 star spoke in support of legislation that would increase federal funding for @entity10 's disease while his emotional wife @entity95 sat watching from the gallery			1
@entity30 senator @entity97 ( @entity98 ) senator @entity99 ( @entity100 ) senator @entity101 ( @entity102 ) senator @entity103 ( @entity104 ) senator @entity51 ( @entity60 ) senator @entity105 ( ne ) senator @entity106 ( @entity107 ) @entity108 senator @entity109 ( @entity110 ) senator @entity111 ( @entity112 ) senator @entity113 ( @entity60 ) senator @entity114 ( @entity115 ) senator @entity116 ( @entity107 ) senator @entity117 ( @entity118 ) senator @entity119 ( mt ) senator @entity120 ( @entity121 ) senator @entity122 ( @entity123 ) is this thing on ? the jolly actor broke the ice with a few off - color jokes , the likes of which such dry committee hearings rarely see above it all : ' this has nothing to do with the legalization of marijuana , ' he joked			1
' in fact , if you can believe it , this concerns something that i find even more important ' despite the poor attendance , @entity0 deftly broke the ice in what would ordinarily have been a typically dry subcommittee hearing			2
‘ this has nothing to do with the legalization of marijuana , ’ he joked			0
‘ in fact , if you can believe it , this concerns something that i find even more important			0
’ @entity152 rippled through the room			0
the actor was making weed jokes to senators			2
@entity0 also poked fun at @entity20 chairman @entity27 ( @entity158 )			2
' you told me you never saw @entity161 , chairman , ' he said , after lamenting that the committee members had no clue who he was			0
‘ i will wager this is the first time in any congressional hearing in history that the words " knocked up " have been used , ' @entity27 shot back			0
@entity0 soon got serious about why he was there			2
close to home : @entity0 's mother - in - law @entity80 was diagnosed with early - onset alzheimer 's in her mid- 50s			1
she 'd forgotten who she was and how to care for herself by 60			0
here , @entity0 sits with his wife @entity95 at the @entity1 hearing ‘ i started dating my wife @entity176 nine years ago when her mother was almost 54 years old			1
it was during this trip , the first time i met my now mother - in - law , that @entity176 first admitted to herself and then to me that something was off with her mother , ’ he said			1
‘ soon after this trip at 55 years old @entity176 's mother was diagnosed with early onset @entity10			1
’ @entity0 said @entity80 ’s @entity10 ’s did not only begin early in life , but also progressed quickly			1
‘ after forgetting who she and her loved one were , ’ @entity0 told the panel			2
‘ she forgot how to speak , feed herself , dress herself , all by age of 60			0
’ @entity0 is one of the @entity195 ’s celebrity champions			2
he ’s also started his own charity with his wife			0
‘ the situation is so dire , that it caused me , a lazy , self - involved , generally self - medicated man - child , to start an entire charity organization , ’ he said			0
the ' @entity161 ' star praised his father - in - law for making @entity80 comfortable as her disease progresses and opened up about his decision to start his own fund , ' @entity206 , ' to support other families and research on the illness			1
he added : ’ i came here today for few reasons			0
one i 'm a huge “ @entity212 ” fan			0
... two , people need more help			0
i 've personally witnessed the massive amount of financial strain this disease causes			0
... three , to show people they are not alone , so few people share their personal stories			2
’ the attendees were moved by @entity0 's words but the actor was disappointed in the attendance			1

the 31 - year - old actor 's mother - in - law suffers from early onset @entity10
@entity0 made the trip to @entity1 to *convince* @entity6 to funnel more money toward *fighting* the disease
while he began with jokes , the actor took to @entity237 by the end to call out senators who left early or failed to show up
only two senators of the 18 on the subcommittee stayed for the movie star 's *testimony*
senator @entity51 of @entity60 thanked @entity0 for his speech in a tweet ... but he did n't even stay to hear it
