@entity0 turned to the banks of photographers , stripped off his shirt , clenched his fists , struck a pose like he was the @entity6 , showed off his ripped upper body and i felt like throwing up			1
@entity0 had just scored a penalty to make it 4 - 1 in the @entity12 final in @entity13 on saturday			1
it was n’t exactly a crucial wonder goal in the dying seconds to win the game			2
but he stripped and showed off his muscles because he knew it would be the image most widely used online and in the world ’s newspapers			0
he wanted to create an image for the ‘ @entity24			0
’ @entity0 wanted to be ' @entity24			1
’ it 's all about him ! @entity0 scored a late penalty and immediately stripped off in @entity13 on saturday @entity27 taking hold : @entity29 will always be in the shadow of @entity0 , who demands @entity33 attention not a blind bit of difference : @entity0 's spot kick had little consequence on the @entity12 final result the main man : the @entity41 striker wanted to be the iconic image of the @entity24 victory you see , in @entity0 ’s world , it ’s all about @entity0			1
and as long as he is at @entity33 then @entity33 will always be about @entity0			0
he ’s a great player , so you can probably forgive the size of the ego , but @entity0 ’s obsession with himself will have implications , notably for @entity29			1
while they are both at the @entity53 , @entity29 will always be in @entity0 ’s shadow , no matter how well he plays			2
with @entity0 in the team it ’s never about the collective			0
@entity29 wandered around after the trophy lift bouncing the ball , doing the @entity61 thing with a scarf tied to his forehead , but almost a peripheral figure as the celebrations began in earnest			0
this is the man who cost a world - record fee			0
this is the man who scored @entity33 ’s best goal of the season in the @entity74 final against @entity75			0
he also scored the goal in extra time that gave @entity33 the lead - a lead they never relinquished			1
i suspect @entity29 would publicly deny that he ’s upset in any way about @entity0 poking home a penalty and stealing the glory			1
but he ’s a rare kind of footballer if his ego is n’t at least slightly wounded			0
most of us wanted to be first pick in the playground , but few of us had the honour			0
after being the only pick at @entity94 for a season he ’s had to lurk behind @entity0 hoping someone sees him in his first year in @entity97			0
and on the night when he genuinely emerged from the shadows to claim top dog spot , @entity0 got naked and sent the @entity100 back to the shadows			2
right now , with two cups to celebrate in his first season at such a great club , @entity29 will be happy to let @entity0 be the star			2
but if @entity0 continues to hog the headlines and limelight , i ’d be surprised if it does n’t become a problem at some point for @entity29			2
especially if like saturday night , the story should n’t be about @entity0			1
that 's the one : @entity29 scored the important second goal for @entity33 in extra time as they sealed the win			1

real beat city *rivals* @entity119 in @entity13 on saturday night
@entity0 scored a penalty and immediately stripped off in celebration
@entity29 scored the important second goal in extra time to set up win
@entity0 wanted to be the picture of @entity12 win
