they 're waiting for us down the street ' - and it was the last words he ever heard them speak			2
there have been no leads into their disappearances but the family has not given up ; they have now turned to social media and have ploaded artists ' renditions of what the girls would look like today			1

' to this day we still do n't know what happened to them , ' their brother , @entity51 , told @entity56 9			0

it 's been this long , i 'm pretty sure something bad happened to them			0
' no trace of the girls has been found since they disappeared in the middle of the day that july			0
a missing persons report was only placed for @entity14 as she was a juvenile at the time , and lt. @entity70 , who is investigating the case , told @entity72 she was listed as a runaway for some time			2
but the girls ' families are certain there was foul play involved as they often hitchhiked , and asked investigators to see if any bones found in the area matched the girls , but they have not			2
today : an artist 's rendition of how the women would look now - @entity14 aged 43 , left , and @entity39 aged 46 , right dna swabs have been taken from @entity51 and his mother , but so far they have not matched up with any unclaimed human remains at labs in the country , @entity70 said			1
there has also been no activity on @entity9 's @entity92 number since july 1985			0
she was eventually listed as a missing person when her parents said they had not heard from her			0
' we do n't know if the girls are still alive , ' @entity70 said			0
' we do n't know if any human remains of the girls have been found and not identified yet , and we do n't know if the remains are somewhere in a field			0
