author ] @entity1 @entity2 - 5 he needs to ask himself : ‘ am i making this @entity1 cricket team a better team ? ’ from the outside it does n’t appear that he is			1
at the moment the same mistakes are happening time after time , whether it be batting collapses , being bounced out , bowling too short			0
the captaincy does n’t come naturally to him but it is not something you are going to give up easily , believe me			0
it is the best job an @entity1 cricketer can have but he needs to decide if he is making a difference			1
ready to walk : @entity20 leaves the crease after being dismissed during day four of the second test defeat : @entity20 leaves the field after @entity25 's victory on day five of the second test at @entity26 looking forward : @entity20 's leadership qualities have come under fire during his time as @entity1 captain video i will not walk away - @entity20 would we miss @entity20 the captain if he did n’t turn up at the @entity34 ? no , i do n’t think so			1
but are we missing @entity20 the world - class batsman with all those test hundreds ? yes , definitely			1
when i gave up the captaincy i literally woke up one morning and decided i ’d had enough			0
i ’d started to notice in the field that i ’d lost the dressing room and i knew inside i was out of energy and it was affecting my decision - making			1
i knew my time was up			0
i did n’t think me being captain would make @entity1 a better team and that is what @entity20 must decide			1
i ’ve heard people say that there is no one else but that is not a good enough reason to keep the status quo			2
if you decide he is not the right man for the job then you can find someone else			0
what went wrong : @entity20 , third left , and coach @entity60 , second right , look on during day five @entity62 - 4 having seen @entity64 bat on a pitch like that he should have learned you have to leave the ball well outside off - stump			1
with @entity69 , @entity20 and @entity70 at the top of the order @entity1 are very one - paced			1
@entity73 - 8 another very good hundred in the first innings and looks a good , solid player like a lot of the young lads in the side			1
very reliable and will bat at @entity80 for a while			0
@entity82 - 4 a victim of the curse of the @entity86 award			2
a bit like @entity88 the year before , the wheels have come off since he got it			1
he will consider himself unlucky in this test but his lack of runs is going under the radar because of @entity20 ’s struggles			1
shock : @entity82 looks on in disbelief after being bowled by @entity25 bowler @entity98 at @entity26 @entity99 - 7 excellent counter-attacking cricket in the second innings			1
he will be disappointed with the shot he got out to but he needs to be positive			0
he ’s a solid , tough cricketer and looks more impressive every time i see him			0
@entity107 - 6 got runs in both innings and some useful wickets as well			2
looks a very elegant player but he needs to work on the short ball because he can not take his eye off it like he did yesterday just before lunch			0
lonely walk : @entity88 has decided to take some time out from @entity1 duty following the defeat uncertain : prior looks on from the home team balcony during @entity1 's loss to @entity25 at @entity26 @entity88 - 4 i 'm not surprised he has decided to step aside for now because of injury			1
he looks shot to me , both mentally and physically			0
the selectors need to look at the senior players and decide if they are past their best			0
prior has been a fantastic wicketkeeper - batsman — one of @entity1 ’s very best — but he has to decide if he wishes to go on long - term for his country			1
another injection of youth and mental energy could well help @entity1 because there are clearly still some mental scars from @entity137			1
there are some battered and bruised players in that team at the moment			0
prior played a poor shot in the second innings before the new ball			0
@entity145 - 5 i thought he bowled well in both innings and pitched the ball up			2
he bowled with passion and seems to be the go - to man			2
unfortunately his batting has fallen off a cliff and , in that respect , it looks as if he is mentally just gone			0
@entity155 - 5 guilty of bowling too short in the first innings and needed to pitch the ball up more			2
he and @entity159 both bowled too short on that first day and it cost @entity1 the @entity162			2
@entity163 - 8 it was a big game for him because everyone was asking whether he would be able to bowl on a green pitch and he showed he could			1
useful runs and looks a very good all - round cricketer			2
@entity171 - 6 at least he corrected his mistakes from the first innings but in the old days he would have used those conditions better			0
he seems to have become more of a hit - the - deck bowler as he has got older .			0

former @entity1 captain @entity178 thinks @entity20 would perform better without the *burden* of being captain
he also believes @entity88 's decision to step back from @entity1 duty is a good one , with the wicket - keeper struggling for *fitness* and form
@entity178 thinks @entity73 and @entity163 were the *standout* *performers* for @entity1 , while @entity191 led the way for @entity25 at @entity26
