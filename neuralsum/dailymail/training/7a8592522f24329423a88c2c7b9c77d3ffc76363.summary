stunned : van driver @entity6 , 60 , from @entity15 , @entity9 , could n't believe it when he was prosecuted for accidentally splashing a pcso when he drove down a flooded road mr @entity10 accused him of drenching him with a ' six foot high wall of water ' by deliberately driving through a 10ft by 3ft puddle			1
enraged mr @entity6 was told to either go on a driving awareness course or face prosecution - and he decided to fight his corner , insisting the officer was telling a ' pack of lies '			1

the case got as far as the magistrates court but the @entity31 suddenly dropped it as the trial was about to start - admitting their evidence was ' irregular '			1
mr @entity6 , from @entity15 , @entity9 , said : ' this police officer and @entity11 came to my home and showed me a piece of paper saying i had been driving and careless or inconsiderate manner			1
' i told them ' you 're joking ' but they went ahead			2
' i wrote them a long letter saying i could n't guarantee turning up to the driving awareness course because of health issues			2
' they then decided to take me to court and at that point i saw the pc and the @entity11 's witness statement			0
' i was so incensed by how incorrect it was			0
i was n't having none of it			0
it was a complete pack of lies			0
' i 'm not the kind of person who goes about looking for a copper to splash			0
' i have never denied that the road was flooded			0
and i have never denied that i could have accidentally splashed the @entity11			0
' but there is no way there was one puddle of those exact measurements on the road			0
the whole road was puddles			0

the witness used an interpreter , but the court found there was no interpreter 's signature on the original statement and dropped the case			0
mr @entity6 says he has received no apology from the police , who he blasted for wasting time and money on the case			1
he said : ' they expected me to cave in , but i refused to give up			0
i went back to where it happened five times to gather information			0
' i can not believe we went all the way to court over a puddle			0
what a waste of money and time			1
the police should be putting their resources in to solving real crimes			1
