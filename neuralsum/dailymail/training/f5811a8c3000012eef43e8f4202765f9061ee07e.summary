by @entity0 @entity1 , chairman of the @entity2 , is under pressure following fresh claims about the chaotic spending culture of the union fresh claims about the chaotic spending culture at the @entity2 emerged last night			1
as mps prepare to debate the structure and running of the police ‘ union ’ tomorrow , @entity2 officials faced disturbing new questions about how its money is spent			1
analysis of its accounts revealed that officials ran up a £ 927,155 bill in 2012 during a high profile campaign on members ’ pay and conditions at the time of a public sector pay squeeze			1
in 2010 , officials spent just £ 250,000 on a similar pay campaign			1
in addition insiders at the @entity2 , which represents more than 120,000 rank and file officers , made a series of startling allegations that : the latest allegations about the finances of the @entity2 – described by one source as just the tip of the iceberg – will concern the hard - working officers who fund it through subscriptions			1
it emerged recently that a @entity2 whistleblower , @entity42 , has been sacked after challenging its seemingly out of control spending culture			1
and on monday police widow pc @entity46 accused @entity2 officials of using their corporate credit cards to turn the annual @entity49 event for fallen officers into a ‘ drunken jolly ’			1
the @entity2 rejected her allegations			2
last night the @entity2 repeatedly refused to answer questions about the enormous cost of the 2012 pay campaign , its use of @entity54 or @entity55 for meetings of its @entity57 , and the alleged trip to @entity59			1
questions about the offshore accounts were also blocked			1
instead , it issued a prepared statement from under pressure chairman @entity1 , whose organisation is still reeling from the aftermath of the @entity70 scandal			0
the latest allegations about the finances of the @entity2 - described by one source as just the tip of the iceberg ( stock picture ) a subsequent review by former @entity79 permanent secretary sir @entity78 found a ‘ worrying loss of confidence and competence ’			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ the leadership remains committed to driving the organisation forward and ensuring it is accountable			0
‘ prior to the publication of the review , i acknowledged the need for the organisation to be open and transparent in how members ’ money is spent			2
‘ despite some justified criticism of the @entity2 , a great deal of excellent work has taken place			0
’ the last time public trust in the police was as low as it is today was following the police strikes of 1918 , during the @entity98 , says @entity99 mp the last time public trust in the police was as low as it is today was following the police strikes of 1918 , during the @entity98			0
after that dispute the police were granted a pay rise , but were also forbidden membership of a trade union			2
in place of a union , the @entity2 was set up by the government to give voice to the concerns of police officers			1
the @entity2 worked to ensure that officers were protected and that respect for policing was maintained			0
in other words , it started as a constructive force behind @entity118 policing			0
today , i fear the opposite is true			0
we saw the most recent example of the @entity2 ’s failings in the fallout from @entity126 ’s altercation with an officer in @entity128			2
following that incident , three @entity2 representatives met with the former chief whip to discuss what had transpired			2
the officers brazenly misrepresented to the gathered press what had been discussed			0
even after being censured in @entity136 by the @entity137 , they outrageously still refused to apologise to mr @entity126 personally			0
the public , quite naturally , came to the conclusion that if @entity141 could be treated in this way , so could anyone			0
an independent panel set up to examine the failures within the organisation delivered a damning report condemning the @entity2 ’s ‘ traditional tendency to attack ’ and saying some members were ‘ bringing the @entity2 into disrepute ’			1
even the @entity2 ’s members are disillusioned			1
many feel that those in the upper echelons of the organisation have lost touch with grassroots members , and grown too accustomed to the trappings of power			0
consider , for example , the @entity2 ’s luxurious £ 26million headquarters in @entity161 , @entity162			1
this hq includes a 55 - room hotel with a bar , indoor swimming pool and 11 two - bedroom grace - and - favour apartments			2
membership fees had to be raised by 23 per cent in 2010 to cover a hole in the @entity2 ’s finances caused by the purchase of the @entity161 headquarters			2
the late sir @entity173 once noted that the size of a company ’s headquarters is directly proportional to its decadence			0
on this basis , any reasonable person wandering past this police palace would conclude that the @entity2 was beyond saving			2
how ironic that this organisation was specifically designed not to be a trade union – but has now acquired the worst characteristics of the sort of self - serving trades unions we thought we saw the end of in the @entity189			0
yet despite all this criticism , the @entity2 refuses to change its ways			0
last week @entity42 , a former principal private secretary brought in to help it reform itself , was sacked after being told she had ‘ alienated ’ senior officials			0
ms @entity42 had raised ‘ serious concerns ’ about the management of the @entity2 ’s accounts			1
there has been disquiet about some @entity2 officials ’ extensive use of corporate credit cards to pay large bar bills			1
( the organisation is also currently facing an inquiry by @entity203 into up to £ 2million claimed by some officials as business expenses			0
) the @entity2 's hq includes a 55 - room hotel with a bar , indoor swimming pool and 11 two - bedroom grace - and - favour apartments ms @entity42 confirmed that she had been opposed by a ‘ vocal minority ’ who were resisting attempts to implement the changes recommended by the independent panel ’s report			1
the problem is , this ‘ vocal minority ’ appears to be running the show			0
the @entity2 ’s accounts reveal that an astonishing sum – almost £ 8million a year – is spent on litigation on behalf of members			1
just yesterday @entity223 , the civil liberties group , announced that , if the police officer @entity224 – who disputes @entity126 ’s claims that he lied about the mp calling him a ‘ pleb ’ – launches a libel case against mr @entity126 , it will seek to intervene in the legal battle in support of the former chief whip			2
@entity223 believes that by holding the threat of legal action over those who disagree with the police ’s version of events , it will become impossible to complain about the police ’s actions			0
it is difficult to disagree			0
the rank and file of this country ’s police force do a difficult job and , for the most part , they do it well			0
that ’s why it ’s a scandal that they are represented by this bullying , crony - filled organisation that raises members ’ subscription fees to pay for swimming pools and grace - and - favour flats in @entity161 , and lavish trips on which @entity2 officials run up huge bar bills			1
one police widow has accused @entity2 officials of treating what should have been a dignified memorial day for fallen officers like a ‘ drunken jolly ’			1
the government must act quickly to return the @entity2 to its noble roots , and return effective representation to the police force .			2

new claims emerge about @entity2 's chaotic spending culture

analysis of accounts revealed that officials ran up a £ 927,155 bill in 2012 during a high - profile campaign on members ' pay and conditions
officials have been forced to hire *conference* *facilities* at a theme park or *racecourse* for certain meetings as there is *insufficient* room at the union ’s £ 26million hq .
representatives of the union travelled to @entity59 to source slate to adorn the outside of the hq ahead of its construction in 2007 .
@entity305 have invested vast sums of money in mysterious , offshore accounts .
