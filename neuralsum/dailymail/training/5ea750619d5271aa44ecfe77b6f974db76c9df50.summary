by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 10:22 est , 19 october 2012 these incredible pictures show how astronauts released the latest tranche of cubesats into orbit around the @entity6			2
five of the tiny satellites were placed into orbit from the @entity10 earlier this month , including one designed to flash morse code messages across the night sky			1
@entity14 astronaut @entity13 prepared them for deployment via the space station 's new @entity17 attached to its @entity19			1
ready for deployment : @entity14 astronaut @entity13 prepares the cubesats for launch from he @entity17 ( @entity24 ) , which is visible inside the airlock the @entity24 shown attached to the @entity19 's robotic arm , from which the cubesats were released into @entity6 orbit as part of a test of the feasibility of deploying them without going on a spacewalk bobbing along : several tiny satellites float in front of an @entity10 solar panel in this image by an expedition 33 crew member from the @entity10 so small : five cubesats - @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 - were sent into earth obit from @entity10 this month they tiny orbiters were carried into space as part of the @entity52 @entity51 space mission to resupply the @entity10 , and deployed as part of an technology experiment to test the feasilibity of releasing satellites without space walks			1
cubesats are a type of miniaturised satellite for space research that usually measure no more than 10cm cubed and with a mass of no more than 1.33kg			1
the majority of development of the low - cost satellites comes from academia , and they typically make use commercial , off - the - shelf electronics in their design			0
because of their simplicity , @entity71 forms a cost - effective independent means of getting a payload into orbit			0
lightweight : cubesats are a type of miniaturised satellite for space research that usually measure no more than 10cm cubed and with a mass of no more than 1.33kg low cost : the majority of development of the low - cost satellites comes from academia , and they typically make use of commercial , off - the - shelf electronics in their design most cubesats carry one or two scientific instruments as their primary mission payload			1
five cubesats - @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 - were sent into earth obit from @entity10 this month			2
niwaka - aka @entity92 - 1 - is designed to twinkle like an artificial star to write messages across the sky that can be visible from @entity6			2
tiny : the 4in - square , 3lb @entity92 - 1 seen from the top , left , and bottom , right			2
it will broadcast the message ' hi this is @entity100 ' spelled out in @entity101 across the heavens using high - powered @entity103 message from the heavens : this artist 's impression shows the message that @entity41 will write across the night sky the tiny orbiter 's mission is to broadcast the message ' hi this is @entity100 ' in @entity101 , using bursts of intense light to draw the dots and dashes across the heavens			1
using high - power @entity103 driven by pulses of energy as high as @entity120 will produce flashes of light so bright its makers hope it will be observable with the naked eye or with small binoculars			0
it was originally planned to appear only over @entity100 , but a flurry of interest means that it will now be touring the entire globe			1
launch successful : @entity41 was launched along with two other cubesats from the @entity10 last thursday using high - power @entity103 driven by pulses of energy as high as @entity92 will produce flashes of light so bright its makers hope it will be observable with the naked eye or with small binoculars the @entity10 is planning to change its orbit after narrowly avoiding two pieces of space junk last month			1
a broken @entity141 satellite and the remains of an @entity144 rocket passed within miles of the @entity10 , with the station primed to move and the astronauts having a tense few hours wondering if disaster was about to strike			1
now , the @entity141 space program 's @entity148 says it will move the @entity10 into a different orbit to lower the risk of possible collisions			0
there is ' no practical aim ' to the morse code beacons , according to its creator , professor @entity156 of the @entity157 , except to test the possibility of optical communication from space			0
the @entity92 - 1 team say it will try to fulfil all requests for appearances			0
however , despite the brightness of its leds it can not be seen through heavy cloud cover , so skywatchers should hope for a clear night if they hope to see it passing above their part of the world			0
the 3lb satellite 's main mission is to test a high - speed data transmitter which will beam vga images taken by an onboard camera back to @entity6			2
scientists believe their transmitter can send a 480x640 jpeg within 6 seconds			0
@entity92 - 1 will orbit the earth between 51.6 degrees south latitude and 51.6 degrees north latitude and it will carry a mounted neodymium magnet to force it to always point to magnetic north like a compass			0
more information on the @entity41 can be found on its information page on the @entity157 's website .			0

five were launched this month to test new deployment technology
they were carried up by a @entity52 rocket sent to resupply the station
cubesats are a kind of satellite measuring just 10cm x 10cm x 10cm
one tiny orbiter will write ' hi this is @entity100 ' across the heavens
it will tour the globe so skywatchers worldwide can see its message
