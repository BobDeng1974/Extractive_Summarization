the presence of wind turbines near homes has wiped tens of thousands of pounds off their value , according to the first major study into the impact the eyesore structures have on house prices			1
the study by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) – which looked at more than a million sales of properties close to wind farm sites over a 12 - year period – found that values of homes within 1.2 miles of large wind farms were being slashed by about 11 per cent			1
this means that if such a wind farm were near an average house in @entity22 , which now costs almost £ 250,000 , it would lose more than £ 27,000 in value			1
homes located within 1.2miles of wind farms can decrease in value by up to 11 per cent , a study has discovered in sought - after rural idylls where property prices are higher , the financial damage is even more substantial			1
in villages around one of @entity33 ’s largest onshore developments – @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , where homes can cost close to £ 1 million – house values could drop by more than £ 100,000			2
the study further discovered that even a small wind farm that blighted views would hit house values			2
homes within half a mile of such visible turbines could be reduced in value by about seven per cent			2
even those in a two - and - a - half - mile radius experienced price reductions of around three per cent			1
homes within a two - and - a - half mile radius could see reductions of up to three per cent the report ’s author , professor @entity52 , said his research was the first strong evidence that wind farms are harmful to house prices			1
green taxes are set to be frozen to reduce soaring energy bills			0
@entity61 sources say the government is preparing to put the brakes on the ‘ carbon tax ’ on greenhouse - gas emissions , with an announcement expected in the @entity67 in march			0
prime minister @entity68 has reportedly instructed aides to ‘ get rid of all this green c * * p ’ to reduce energy bills , which currently average £ 1,350 a year			0
prof @entity52 , director of the @entity10 ’s @entity72 , said : ‘ property prices are going up in places where they ’re not visible and down in the places where they are			0
’ the study , which is still in draft form but is due to be published next month , focused on 150 wind - farm sites across @entity80 and @entity81			2
it compared house - price changes in areas that had wind farms , were about to see one built or had seen one rejected by the local authority			1
last night @entity88 , mp for @entity89 , said : ‘ there ’s plenty of anecdotal evidence – especially in my constituency – of house - price reductions near wind turbines			0
the question is , will anybody be liable for these losses in future ? ’ and @entity99 , policy and communications director at the @entity102 at the @entity10 , said : ‘ these results are not really surprising as it is already known that people place a value on countryside views			0
’ a @entity109 spokesman said : ‘ developments will only get permission where impacts are acceptable			0
’ a spokesman for @entity114 , which represents the wind industry , said : ‘ we will be analysing the conclusions closely when the final report is issued			0

study by @entity10 found value of homes close to wind farms slashed by 11 **%**
home that costs £ 250,000 would lose £ 27,000 in value
homes as far at two - and - a - half miles away could be reduced by 3 **%**
