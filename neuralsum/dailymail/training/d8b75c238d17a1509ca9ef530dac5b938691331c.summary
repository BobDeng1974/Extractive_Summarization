by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 4 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:08 est , 4 february 2014 a mother - of - three has lost half of her body weight after her daughter was teased by playground bullies for having a ‘ fat mum ’			1
@entity9 , 32 , weighed 24 stone when her 10 - year - old daughter , @entity11 , complained that children at school were making cruel comments about her size			1
' she came home and said , " @entity18 , everyone at school says you ’re fat " , ' said @entity9 , of @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity9 has gone from weighing 24st ( right ) and size 28 , to just 12st ( left ) and a slim size 10 @entity9 , pictured here with her son @entity26 , 6 , and daughters @entity11 , 10 , and @entity28 , 7 , decided to lose weight after her daughter got bullied at school over her mother 's size ' i was absolutely gutted and felt like i had let her down			1
i wanted to be a mum she could be proud of - not someone who just hid away			0
' a busy waitress and a single mother to @entity11 , @entity28 , seven , and @entity26 , six , @entity9 was so big her children could not fully wrap their arms around her to give her a hug			2
having spent years over-indulging on huge portions of shepherd ’s pie , takeaways and cheese , @entity9 vowed to drop the pounds			1
' i ’d grown to hate my body , and shopping was a nightmare , ' said @entity9			2
@entity9 spent years indulging in super-sized portions of shepherd ’s pie , takeaways and cheese at her heaviest , @entity9 was so big her children could not fully wrap their arms around her to give her a hug ' i was so big that i had to buy two pairs of size 28 jeans , cut the waistband off the second pair and use it to extend the first			1
' it was so embarrassing			0
i felt like everyone was staring at me , and i had no confidence			0
' but it would prove to be these super-sized jeans that helped @entity9 drop an astonishing nine dress sizes , to a slim size 10			1
after ditching the junk food for fruit and vegetables and taking up running , @entity9 devised her own unique way to monitor her weight loss			1
she would visit the plus - size section of clothes shops , grab a pair of size 28 jeans - which used to be tight for her - and head straight to the changing rooms			1
@entity9 said : ' i know it sounds silly , but seeing my new body in these massive jeans really spurred me on			1
@entity9 devised her own unique way to monitor her weight loss , comparing her body to her old size 28 jeans ' every time i tried them on and they were even baggier , i could see how much progress i had made			1
' on my first time , back in december 2012 , i was a size 20 , and even then i could see a huge difference			2
' by the time i ’d dropped to a size 16 in march 2013 , i could even fit in one leg			2
and when i hit a size 12 in november last year , i celebrated by posing with a pair of size 12 jeans			1
her incredible 12 stone weight loss means @entity11 can now put her arms all the way round her mother for the first time in years ( right ) , and her old jeans swamp her new svelte frame ( left ) ' the shop assistants must have thought i was mad , but i really do think it helped me lose all the weight			1
it just proved to me that i never wanted to be that big ever again			0
' one person who approved of @entity9 ’s unusual weight loss tactic was her daughter , @entity11			1
although her mum had previously been too big for her to hug properly , as the weight fell off , @entity11 was able to reach further and further - finally cuddling her mum for the first time late last year			2
breakfast : none lunch : large breakfast baguette from the local garage dinner : over-sized portion of home - cooked pasta or shepherd ’s pie , with a full block of cheese sprinkled on top			0
then a takeaway once the children were asleep snacks : sandwiches , crisps and chocolate breakfast : porridge with almond milk , two poached eggs and a banana lunch : toasted wholemeal wrap with chicken , lettuce , tomatoes , cucumber and onions with feta cheese dinner : grilled salmon , broccoli and roasted baby potatoes snacks : almonds , fruit or peppermint tea @entity9 says : ' she called it her hug test			2
once a week , she would give me a big hug to see how much weight i had lost			0
' since losing the weight , @entity9 has seen her health improve dramatically			1
in june 2013 @entity9 completed the @entity165 whilst she used to struggle to walk up the stairs and suffered from sleep apnoea , she now regularly visits the gym and has a passion for weightlifting			2
in june 2013 , she even completed the @entity165 , which she says she would never have dreamed of attempting before			0
' this is a change for life , ' said @entity9			2
' i am so much more confident , and i no longer hide myself away			0
' before , i would stay in my car on the school run			0
watching all of the slim , glamorous mums in their skinny jeans reminded me of how much i had let myself go - i was so ashamed			0
' when @entity11 told me that other children had said i was fat , i felt like i had let her down too			0
i wanted to be a mum my kids would be proud of , and i promised myself there and then that i would n’t let my kids see me be buried in a super-sized coffin			0
' @entity9 plans to use her weight - loss trick to make sure that she does n’t slip back into her old ways			1
' every once in a while , i ’ll go back to the shops and try on my old - sized jeans , ' she said			0
' whenever i ’m tempted to order a takeaway or skip my daily run , i ’ll think back to how horrible i felt when i had to wear them , and how much better i feel about myself now			0
' i ’ll never let myself go again			0
it ’s not just my jeans that have gone from super-sized to super-skinny ! '			0
