@entity0 has guaranteed @entity1 will be protected from a more powerful eurozone as the two countries examine plans to kick out jobless migrants after three months			1
@entity6 yesterday signalled his support for the idea to send migrants home if they fail to find work			2
now @entity11 has offered a fresh boost to the prime minister ’s plans to curb @entity16 ’ influence after @entity0 said the @entity1 must not be put at a disadvantage by eurozone nations ' moves to integrate more closely			1
@entity0 chancellor @entity20 has offered @entity6 fresh support for his plans to reform the @entity23 mr @entity6 has promised that if he is prime minister after the next election he will claw back powers from the @entity23 before holding an in - out referendum			1
@entity0 chancellor @entity20 is a key ally in any attempt to reshape the @entity23 , and @entity28 is delighted at the lengths she will go to to ensure @entity1 remains in the bloc of 28 countries			1
the @entity11 government released a report suggesting that new arrivals should be returned to their countries of origin within a few months			0
@entity0 politicians have suggested the limit should be set at 3 months - though the document does not specify an exact deadline			0
the @entity1 has already restricted access to benefits for migrants until they have been in @entity1 for three months			0
mr @entity6 said he would work with @entity11 on plans to deport jobless migrants who fail to find work but the @entity0 plans would go further , giving member states the right to kick out those who are not working			1
mr @entity6 said the proposals are proof that key @entity23 leaders are coming round to his view that there should be greater restrictions on free movement around the @entity23			2
a major risk for @entity1 has been being squeezed out or over-ruled by countries which use the euro forming closer ties in an attempt to shore up the single currency			0
but in a joint article for the @entity65 , chancellor @entity66 and his @entity0 counterpart @entity63 said any changes to @entity23 treaties must ‘ guarantee fairness ’ for member states outside the single currency bloc			1
the declaration meets one of mr @entity6 's key negotiating demands - that the rights of non-eurozone states must be protected - ahead of his planned 2017 referendum on @entity1 's membership of the @entity23			1
in their article , mr @entity66 and mr @entity63 said that both @entity1 and @entity0 accepted that the eurozone crisis meant that the members of the single currency needed to establish a common fiscal and economic policy			2
‘ the @entity1 fully recognises the progress made so far in responding to the crisis , and it supports the case for further steps forward			0
' but as the euro area continues to integrate , it is important that countries outside the euro area are not at a systematic disadvantage in the @entity23 , ’ they wrote			0
‘ so future @entity23 reform and treaty change must include reform of the governance framework to put euro area integration on a sound legal basis , and guarantee fairness for those @entity23 countries inside the single market but outside the single currency			1
’ the statement will be seen as evidence that mr @entity6 's assiduous efforts to court @entity0 chancellor @entity20 - including rolling out the red carpet for a high - profile visit to @entity110 - are bearing fruit			1
tackling immigration is a major concern in both countries , with @entity0 's coalition government considering proposals to limit the time unemployed migrants from other @entity23 member states can stay in the country looking for a job			1
@entity1 chancellor @entity66 and his @entity0 counterpart @entity63 hav written a joint article guaranteeing @entity1 will be protected from greater eurozone integration mr @entity6 said that he would now seek to work with the @entity0 and other like minded allies to see if they could tighten @entity23 rules further			1
mr @entity6 told @entity128 : ‘ we are doing what the @entity0 are doing which is introduce new rules that you can not immediately claim benefits if you come here and if you are a @entity23 citizen and not looking for work and claiming benefits then you can be removed to your country of origin			1
‘ we ’ll look very closely if the @entity0 want to take this further			0
i talked to @entity20 personally last week and we are going to work with her , with the @entity140 prime minister , with the @entity142 prime minister on how we can tighten up in this area because it is worthwhile work			0
’ @entity66 and @entity63 mrs @entity20 commissioned the report by a @entity0 government committee in january amid concern about the lifting of restrictions on @entity151 and @entity152 migrants			2
an interim version of the report published earlier this week also recommends that governments be allowed to prevent migrants expelled for committing fraud from returning to their countries - a restriction that currently does not exist			0
a spokesman for the @entity162 in @entity110 said : ‘ the committee recommends the introduction of a time limitation on the right of residence for @entity23 citizens seeking employment			2
@entity23 citizens must provide evidence that their ongoing attempts to find a job have a prospect of success			0
‘ the right of @entity23 citizens to reside in @entity0 can already be stopped in case of fraud and abuse of rights , such as forging documents or wilful misrepresentation			2
' however , there is at present no way to prevent the immediate re-entry of @entity23 citizens who abuse their right of freedom of movement			0
‘ therefore , the committee proposes the introduction of temporary re-entry restrictions for cases of “ abuse of rights ” and “ fraud ”			0
’ the final report is due to be published in june			0
@entity28 sources said that they were also encouraged by suggestions from @entity0 that migrants should no longer be able to send child benefit to their children back home - a move that both mr @entity6 and @entity201 have also supported .			2

@entity110 and @entity11 form strong alliance on the future of the @entity23
@entity6 eyes @entity0 report on kicking out migrants who do not get a job
finance ministers also use joint article to insist euro plan will not hit @entity1
