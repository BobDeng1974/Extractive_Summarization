you might expect polar bears , the @entity3 's apex predators , to be dab hands at dancing on ice			1
but as this specimen in @entity9 shows , even after thousands of years of evolutionary adaptation , some still suffer from two - left feet on the frozen ocean			1
@entity13 , a 49 - year - old videographer from @entity14 , said : ' i have encountered polar bears many times every year since i live up here and am used to them			1
' this episode , however , was extraordinary			0
' born slippy : a polar walks across thin sea ice in @entity9 , @entity14 , where it was caught on camera looking very unsteady on its feet as it made its way across the slippery surface spreading its weight : the polar bear does its best not to collapse through the fragile ice by spreading out in its element : the beast finally gave up and pushed a hole in the ice to dive into the freezing water mr @entity13 and his friend @entity37 spent hours in @entity14 's northernmost territory hunting for a polar bear to film and photograph , then hours more waiting for the slumbering beast to wake up			1
it was time well spent			0
the patient duo were treated to a farcical display of slipping and sliding across the frozen sea , with their subject falling flat on its face at least once			2
' maybe we waited 3 - 4 hours before the bear woke up and came out onto thinner and thinner ice , ' mr @entity37 told @entity52			2
' at one point , it spread out on all four legs to prevent falling thorough the ice until finally the bear gave up , pushed through the ice and started to swim			2
' he dived for a few seconds and showed up again , looking up and then started to shake of the water			0
' proud : polar bears are the @entity3 's apex predators and have adapted to the habitat over millennia evolution : regarded as marine mammals because of the many months they spend at sea , polar bears have nevertheless adapted large , flat paws to distribute their bulk as they pad across thin ice brains : however this beast seems to have realised that big feet are not enough to stop it smashing through the thin ice and is trying to spread its weight to lessen the pressure beneath it @entity80 : polar bears can weigh up to 1,100lbs , more than enough to smash through thin layers of frozen sea taking a dip : the polar bear pictured just after deciding it was better off taking a swim in the freezing sea regarded as marine mammals because of the many months they spend at sea , polar bears have nevertheless adapted large , flat paws to distribute their bulk as they pad across thin ice			1
they can weigh up to 1,100lbs , more than enough to smash through layers of frozen sea that would easily hold a man			0
mr @entity37 added : ' it is difficult to explain my feelings in situations like this			0
i think the polar bear is one of the most charismatic animals in the world			0
' it was a rare and very interesting situation to watch everything and this was , without doubt , the ultimate wilderness experience for me			0
' stunning : photographer @entity37 and videographer @entity13 spent hours trying to find a polar bear to document in the stark frozen landscape of @entity9 , the @entity14 @entity3 territory			1

polar bears have evolved special large , flat paws for walking on sea ice
but this specimen from @entity9 nevertheless struggled with its *footing*
the @entity3 *killer* ventured off the thick ice that can support his weight
