@entity0 quit as @entity2 boss - two weeks after being talked out of leaving by his employers			1
the second - longest serving manager in @entity6 senior football was , @entity7 understands , ready to walk after losing 3 - 1 at home to @entity9 a fortnight ago			1
convinced to stay on in the hope of turning around a horrific early - season run of form , @entity0 ultimately had his spirit broken by successive away defeats to @entity15 and @entity16			1
@entity0 has resigned as @entity2 boss having been convinced to stay on just two weeks ago @entity2 players hold their heads in their hands as they succumb to another defeat on friday with his team sitting second bottom of the @entity28 and worried that his own darkening mood had become a drag on the squad ’s spirit , 50 - year - old @entity0 - described by @entity2 directors as one of the most successful managers in their history - broke the news of his decision to club officials following a youth game against @entity37 at @entity38 on sunday			1
despite further attempts to talk him round , the former @entity40 and @entity41 star insisted that it was time to move on			0
board member @entity44 insisted that the directors had been willing to stand by a coach who had regularly over-achieved on a shoestring budget , finishing second in the top flight in consecutive seasons			0
‘ we have been acutely aware of results this season - but everyone at @entity52 was confident in his and the team ’s ability to turn things around , ’ said @entity44			0
‘ however , following a long conversation this afternoon , @entity0 felt it was better for all concerned if he stepped down with immediate effect and we respect that			2
’ @entity0 , pictured after the 1 - 1 draw with @entity37 in september , believed he could no longer take the club forward @entity7 understands that there was no pressure from within the club on @entity0 , whose record of success had made him as close to fireproof as it ’s possible for any manager to be			1
but the man himself felt that he was running out of enthusiasm for the job , fearing that he could n’t get any more out of the group - and confessed to friends that he was beginning to dread matchday			0
he was willing to hang on even after that @entity9 loss , however , because he felt he owed the club his best effort to improve			0
last friday night ’s 2 - 1 defeat to @entity16 at @entity78 appears to have been the last straw			0
an official club statement released last night heaped praise on the departing head coach , saying : ‘ @entity2 can announce @entity0 has resigned from his position as manager			1
@entity0 was the second longest - serving manager in @entity6 football before his resignation on sunday ‘ @entity0 , who was appointed in december 2010 and was the second longest serving manager in @entity6 senior football ( after @entity90 s @entity89 ) informed the board of his decision late this afternoon			1
‘ the 40 - times capped former @entity40 midfielder has overseen a period of incredible success at @entity52 , including taking @entity2 into the @entity97 in 2011 , then three ‘ @entity98 ’ finishes in the @entity6 top flight			2
‘ as manager , he smashed a number of long - standing records , including for games won , goals scored , clean sheets and points accumulated ; the 50 - year old also led @entity2 into the @entity106 for the first and only time back in 2012			2
‘ in contrast , the current season has n’t started as well as anyone would like			0
’ @entity44 , who was instrumental in @entity0 ’s appointment almost four years ago , confirmed that assistant manager @entity111 will act as caretaker until a new manager is found			2
he added : ‘ everyone at @entity2 would like to sincerely thank @entity0 for his contribution to the club , which will go down as one of the most successful managerial tenures in our 128 - year history			1
’ @entity16 's victory over @entity2 on friday proved to be the final straw for long - serving @entity0 there are echoes of @entity0 ’s resignation from @entity126 in 2010 , when he stepped down under very little pressure from the board - arguing that he could n’t take the team any further			1
under his guidance , @entity2 regularly left clubs with bigger finances trailing - as well as turning @entity133 into @entity40 ’s @entity134			2
each summer brought fresh cuts to his budget , however , and @entity0 spent almost every close season bidding farewell to the previous campaign ’s best performers			0
he has become a valued member of @entity142 ’s @entity40 staff since his appointment , on a part - time basis , in january 2013			0
