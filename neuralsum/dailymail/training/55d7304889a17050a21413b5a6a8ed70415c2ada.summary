@entity0 has become the darling of @entity2 with his portrayal of @entity4 in @entity5 , and now the actor is preparing to take on another challenging role - that of @entity8			1
the oscar - winner is reportedly already losing weight to play the @entity12 painter born @entity8 who , with the support of his wife , fellow artist @entity14 , first started living as a woman and finally became one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery in the 1930s			1
directed by @entity21 , the film will explore the extraordinary life of a figure who risked her reputation , marriage and finally her life to be the person she felt she should be			0
@entity8 @entity29 ( left ) , was born in 1882 and went on to become one of the first transgender women , called @entity8 ( right ) her life , which was fictionalised in the novel @entity33 by @entity34 , was optioned to be a film years ago and @entity36 was , at one point , attached to the project			1
now @entity0 will portray @entity8 as a man , and after the age of 30 as a woman living among artists in the bohemian @entity43 of the 1920s and @entity45 , with her ' sister ' @entity46 , who will be played by @entity48 actress @entity47			1
the film will be both an account of an inspirational and radical figure and also a tender love story between two people whose love for each endured until their deaths			0
@entity8 was born @entity55 in @entity12 in 1882 and in his late teens attended the @entity57 in @entity58 , where he met fellow artist @entity14			1
the couple bonded over their love of illustration and dated for a few years , before going on to marry in 1904 , when he was 22			0
the couple travelled in @entity65 extensively and made their income by working as illustrators and painters for magazines and books , with @entity8 living as a man			2
as a landscape artist , he earned @entity12 's @entity75 prize in 1907 and exhibited at @entity76 ( the @entity77 ) in addition to the @entity79 and in the @entity80 in @entity43			1
a photograph of @entity8 in the 1920s but in his mid- 20s , the couple made a discovery that would change the rest of their lives			2
@entity46 needed a woman to pose for a series of illustrations but her model had failed to turn up - instead her husband did the honours and donned a pair of stockings and heels so his legs could substitute for a female 's			0
@entity46 was famous for her paintings of well - dressed , fashionable women with almond - shaped eyes but until 1913 , no one knew that the dark - haired beauty regularly depicted in her work was her husband			0
it was the moment @entity8 realised that he felt particularly comfortable in women 's clothing and started to develop his female persona , who he called @entity8			1
soon the artist spent found himself spending more time as @entity8 than as @entity8 and she spent less and less time paying attention to her art. according to @entity8 's biography , man into woman , edited by @entity117 - a friend of the @entity119 writing under a pseudonym - for a few years @entity8 only dressed as @entity8 when @entity46 was desperate for a model			1
but as @entity8 began to dress more regularly as a woman , the couple decided to settle in @entity43 , where it was more accepted			1
during the 1920s and @entity127 openly attended events in the @entity129 capital dressed as a woman , pretending to be @entity8 's sister			1
more people became learned about the @entity134 ' secret and she and @entity46 became known for their raucous dinner parties among the arty set			0
slowly , @entity8 began to feel himself dying , and he realised that @entity8 was taking him over			2
and unable to be content with this existence , and convinced he had a naturally female body , @entity8 met dr @entity139 of the @entity140 , who , according to the biography , immediately understood @entity8 ’s problem			2
she moved out of the home she shared with @entity46 and contacted surgeons about attempting gender reassignment surgery			1
in 1930 , she travelled to @entity146 in @entity147 to have the surgery - something that was completely new at the time			2
a portrait of @entity8 by her wife @entity151 between 1930 and 1931 , @entity8 had five operations to transition into a woman , under the supervision of the eminent @entity147 sexual psychiatrist , dr @entity156 in @entity146			1
first her testicles were removed , followed by a second op to remove the penis and to transplant ovaries taken from a 26 - year - old woman into her body			0
unfortunately the body rejected the ovaries and they had to be removed in a third operation , with other corrective surgeries taking place in the fourth and fifth operations			0
during the operations doctors discovered that @entity8 had rudimentary ovaries herself , proving that she was intersex - when people have sex characteristics of both male and females , so ca n't be distinctly classified as one or the other			2
after her first surgeries she considered herself to be a different person to @entity8 so @entity46 , with @entity8 's blessing , petitioned the @entity180 to dissolve their marriage , arguing that the marriage had held @entity46 back for too long			0
and in 1930 , the @entity180 announced the annulment and issued @entity184 with a passport under her new identity			0
@entity0 with his bafta for @entity5			0
he is now taking on the role of @entity8 in a new film yet her greatest wish was to bear her own children and she underwent risky surgery to transplant a uterus in 1931			1
but after complications following the radical and highly experimental operation , @entity8 passed away two days later , before her 50th birthday			0
her ex-wife @entity46 went on to re-marry , to an @entity199 military officer called @entity200 , but the marriage was n't to last and they divorced after just a few years			0
@entity46 passed away as a single woman in 1940 .			0
