@entity2 ’ dance anthem ‘ @entity6 ’ booms out seconds before games at @entity4 , and it ’s rather apt for @entity5			1
his sleepless nights must be becoming all the more frequent as these haunting weeks go by			2
@entity9 rained the boos yet again from a disgruntled bunch of supporters who deserve so much more than this ; far more than a team lacking identity and direction			2
those fans will quite rightly point to the fact their side were out - played for large parts against @entity21 , a club with a far inferior budget and experience at this level			1
they are losing faith in their manager , even though @entity4 should retain their championship status from here			1
@entity29 ( left ) pokes home the equaliser but @entity4 were unable to push on for the winner that they came away with a point was down to poor finishing from the @entity37 visitors , nothing more			1
@entity29 came to the rescue after @entity41 ’s early opener to spare blushes			1
@entity4 just want this wretched campaign over			1
‘ first half we were awful , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ second half was a huge improvement to a bit better than awful			1
‘ the sooner we get the points needed the sooner i ’ll start sleeping in an evening			2
@entity5 ( centre ) admitted his side were second best and says the club need to rebuild in the summer ‘ it is slow and it ’s painful			1
we need to rebuild in the summer			2
it ’s an anxious period - people are concerned			2
the players did show good character to come from behind			0
’ @entity64 ’ team still await their fate after being charged for fielding an ineligible player , @entity66 , during the win against @entity68 earlier this month			0
should the @entity70 follow the precedent set with @entity72 last year , the @entity69 will find themselves lumped with a three - point deduction			0
when that judgement is to be made remains unclear - although it almost certainly will come before the final day on may 2 - meaning the relegation dogfight could go to the wire , with resurgent @entity77 enjoying a game in hand			2
@entity21 knew points must be won here , and set about bossing proceedings from the very first minute			1
@entity41 ( centre ) pokes home the opener after four minutes to put @entity64 ' side in the lead @entity86 : @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity95 ( @entity94 - 54 ) , @entity96 , @entity29 , @entity97 subs not used : @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 goals : @entity29 67 booked : @entity93 , @entity90 , @entity89 @entity106 : @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 ; @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 ; @entity116 , @entity117 subs not used : @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 goals : @entity117 4 booked : @entity110 referee : @entity128 how it came to pass that @entity41 might ’ve put the visitors three goals up inside the first four minutes will mystify @entity5			1
eventually the former @entity133 striker settled for one , the simplicity galling for a club who were facing @entity137 this time a year ago			0
firstly @entity117 clipped wide inside the six - yard box before the long legs of @entity140 prevented him from tapping home seconds later			2
but @entity4 fell asleep from @entity143 ’s corner to present @entity117 with a third opportunity and he was n’t to miss , stabbing in from close range to signal the @entity147 dissenters to find their voice			1
@entity97 ’s header was cleared off the line in an instant reply , but @entity5 ’ side looked shot , as they had been here against @entity155 and @entity156 previously			2
and they allowed @entity117 in again , this time burn misreading a high ball , but he was thwarted by @entity87			0
@entity116 squandered a glorious chance from 12 yards , skewing a shot wide as @entity4 continued to be carved open			1
@entity96 ( 10 ) is denied a goal by the on - rush @entity164 loanee @entity107 of @entity21 @entity4 's remaining fixtures : @entity168 ( a ) , @entity167 ( @entity166 ) , @entity169 ( a ) @entity21 's remaining fixtures : @entity169 ( @entity172 ) , @entity171 ( @entity166 ) , @entity173 ( a ) @entity110 was guilty of missing a superb chance from another corner and the central defender later struck a post			1
saying they could have scored five before the break is n’t hyperbolic			0
' they could 've been out of sight , ' admitted @entity5			0
@entity96 spurned a good opportunity for the hosts , @entity29 then failing to stretch far enough to covert at the back post			1
every stray pass was met with groans , each overhit cross with sighs			0
many are resigned to these turgid displays , but more than a small section just will not accept it			0
@entity5 was bailed out by @entity29 though , who got on the end of @entity92 ’s pass to poke in a 67th - minute equaliser			1
it was a rare moment of quality , but edges them closer to safety			0
@entity97 ( centre ) was unable to continue his good goalscoring form for the @entity203 ‘ the goal is a blatant handball by @entity29 , ’ @entity21 assistant @entity204 fumed			1
‘ we dominated possession and created a number of opportunities			0
’ ‘ you hope something ’s going to fall for us			0
one thing that can never be labelled against our team is a lot of character and desire			0
that ’s the minimum we expect			0
we ’re enjoying the challenge and had a difficult week			0
a good word to use is defiance			0
’ @entity5 added : ‘ i ’ve seen the goal again and there ’s probably an element of doubt , but i ’d expect them to have a moan about it			0
’ the goal gave the whole place a lift , @entity97 unfortunate not to win a penalty after @entity109 ’s shove and substitute @entity232 thumped a header over when unmarked at the back post			2
oddly , one point may have been three but that would ’ve merely masked glaring deficiencies			0
for all the talk of difficulties , staying in the division is the only thing that matters			0
time for @entity4 to press reset and start again .			1

@entity4 *scrapped* a draw at home to fellow *strugglers* @entity21
@entity41 gave the away side an early lead from close range
@entity29 poked home an equaliser in the second half
fans booed *heavily* when the final whistle was blown at @entity147
