by @entity0 jews in eastern @entity3 are so concerned over their safety after last week 's alleged anti-semitic incidents that they are seeking advice on repatriation to @entity8 , it was claimed today			1
this follows fears over a leaflet distributed in the city of @entity13 which demanded that people over 16 of @entity2 origin should register with the authorities , a sinister development that smacked of the @entity18 - era			1
it has since been branded a fake by the @entity22 separatists it claims to represent , as well as one of the city 's rabbis			1
but some local @entity2 are also concerned about a @entity28 invasion , with tens of thousands of troops within striking distance of the @entity3 frontier , said @entity32 , who runs @entity33 , an organisation assisting people to go and live in @entity8			1
the leaflet distributed in @entity13 , @entity3 , calling for all jews over 16 - years - old to register or face deportation , sparked concern among the area 's 15,000 - strong @entity2 community			1
now many are looking at fleeing @entity3 for @entity8 pamphlets circulating in @entity13 demanded ' citizens of @entity2 nationality ' over the age of 16 pay $ 50 to register and be issued special passports ' marking the confession of faith '			1
' we are talking about @entity2 people returning home to @entity8 , ' he said			1
' it is hard to talk about numbers now but i see that there are more people who come for advice asking how to apply for repatriation			0
' i can not say for sure that they will make a decision to leave for @entity8 , but i do see a rise in the level of interest			2
people call the @entity8 embassy in @entity67			2
they start gathering the documents			0
' recent anti-semitic incidents , including the controversial leaflet in the name of the breakaway @entity73 - which strongly denies any role in it - have led to some of the local 17,000 @entity13 jewish population considering fleeing to @entity8			1
a pro-russian activist stands guard in front of the @entity81 in @entity13 this week			1
the @entity73 has denied responsibility for an anti-semitic flyer circulating in the city while the local rabbi has branded it a fake ' most essential is , of course , the safety issue , ' he said , as well as the chronic economic demise of @entity3			1
' people fear that war will start			0
they realise that the mythical " @entity94 " ( so - called @entity3 nationalist supporters of @entity96 , who @entity28 associate with fascism ) are not a threat - but @entity28 troops are			2
' now you add to that the anti-semitism which has become an issue for some people			0
it 's hard to say how many people would apply to move to @entity8 because of anti-semitism			2
escape : holocaust survivor @entity107 has urged @entity2 in @entity3 to flee the country ' we will see the statistics later , maybe in a month or two , but it is clear that such anti-semitic provocations have not happened here since @entity114 , and no matter who was behind the leaflets , the message itself and the fact that they appeared , do scare people			1
' meanwhile , a @entity124 survivor has urged @entity2 in @entity3 to flee the country			1
@entity107 , 86 , who was 14 when his family were rounded up in @entity127 , western @entity128 , and sent to @entity129 , says @entity3 is still a hotbed of @entity131 mr @entity107 , who now lives in @entity132 , @entity133 , told the @entity134 : ' jews have no place in @entity3 , because nothing has changed , and as long as @entity2 remain there , nothing will change			1
' they had no business staying in that country after the atrocities of 1939 - 1945			0
jews in the @entity3 should leave			2
' before the @entity114 a little under one - third of @entity3 's urban population consisted of @entity2			1
in 1941 there were an estimated 2,700,000 @entity2 in @entity3			1
nearly a million were murdered by the @entity147 , often with the complicity of @entity3 , and they were persecuted under the @entity150 regime			2
in 1959 just 840,446 remained and numbers have declined steadily since then , leaving 65,000 today			0
@entity32 said some jews in @entity13 were pro-russian , others @entity153 , and there was ' no united position ' , but the flare - up of @entity158 was a concern			2
' a month ago i saw small posters hanging in @entity162 in the city centre with anti-semitic content			0
' the poster said that @entity166 want to unite @entity3 with @entity167 , to break the country away from its @entity170 brothers , how wrong this was , and there were quotes from the bible			2
it clearly had an anti @entity2 message			2
a pro-russia activist stands guard in front of the flag of the so - called @entity13 republic outside the police regional building seized by the separatists in the eastern @entity3 city of @entity185 on the edge : the situation in @entity3 is getting worse , with five dead in an attack near @entity189 last night ' i 'm not sure who 's doing it , including those posters that appeared last tuesday , but i do not think that it is the representatives of the @entity13 republic			1
' you have to be really crazy to make such statements and i personally think that it is a provocation , but the problem is that it is very easy to do such a thing			0
' and it will destabilise the situation			0
you can play any political game here and use it in any context			0
' and what worries me is not the leaflets because they are forgeries			0
it is 99.9 per cent that it is just provocation			0
' who can guarantee that it will not move further and someone will be killed , for example			0
' we have a lot of people brought into the town now , some criminal elements who are here to destabilise the situation			0
' and if some side decides to play the @entity2 card , it can just fly out of control			2
' people in balaclavas can come into the synagogue beat someone up or rob them			0
' we do have fears that it can actually happen and there are talks about it in the synagogue			0
i think it can also motivate people to think more about repatriation			0
' @entity245 secretary of state @entity244 branded the leaflet ' grotesque ' while he was in @entity247 as part of peace talks			1
but the handout may have been a fake aimed at stirring up trouble in the region the @entity3 prime minister @entity254 demanded that those responsible for the flyer - calling on @entity2 to register and pay a fee - are found			1
he urged ' the @entity3 military and security forces and @entity3 @entity258 urgently to find these b * * * * * * * and to bring them to justice ' , he said			2
the incident happened as around 20 @entity2 were leaving the synagogue earlier this week			2
the three hooded men handing out the pamphlets were carrying a @entity28 flag and the symbol of the @entity267 of @entity13			0
the leader of the breakaway republic @entity270 - whose name was on the flyer - strongly denied any role			0
however , the flyer has been branded a fake by religious leaders , including the area 's rabbi			1
the flyer , described as ' grotesque ' by @entity245 secretary of state @entity244 , has now been classed by the leader of the city 's @entity2 community as a hoax , aimed at stirring up trouble			1
@entity285 has a long and unfortunate history of the persecution of the @entity2 people			0
in the late 18th century , @entity289 created the @entity290 , which dictated where in @entity285 @entity2 were allowed to reside , an area of about 20 per cent of then - @entity292 which today is part of @entity128 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 and , notably , @entity3			1
@entity297 also saw a wave of anti-jewish riots , known as pogroms , which took off with the violent persecution in @entity302 in 1821 , now the third largest city in @entity3 , which had one of the highest percentages of @entity2 population in the @entity290			1
decades of pogroms followed , with a peak between 1881 to 1884 when more than 200 anti-jewish events occurred in the @entity309 , notably in @entity67 , @entity310 and @entity302			0
the trigger was the assassination of @entity285 's @entity313 , for which many blamed ' the jews '			0
between 1903 and 1906 thousands of @entity2 were killed in pogroms , including the 1905 pogrom of @entity302 which saw up to 2,500 @entity2 men , women and children killed , according to historic reports			0
the pogroms , harsh conditions and wide - spread poverty in the @entity290 saw some two million @entity2 emigrate , mainly to the @entity245 in the late 1800s and early 1900s			1
during the @entity150 era , the @entity324 and countries within its sphere of influence were accused of persecuting @entity2			0
@entity328 was said by numerous sources to despise @entity2 and under @entity330 , @entity2 faced discrimination			0
' perhaps you got @entity3 confused with @entity285 , where @entity2 organizations have noticed growth in anti-semitic tendencies last year			1
