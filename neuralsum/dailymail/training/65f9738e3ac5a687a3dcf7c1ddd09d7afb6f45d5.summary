nearly half of high - flying 11 - year - olds fail to go on to get five good gcses in core subjects , secondary school league tables show			2
of the 160,000 pupils who gained good @entity7 results when they left primary school , 84,000 failed to achieve a c - grade or higher in the ‘ @entity17 ’ subjects of @entity11 , maths , science , history or geography and a language			1
the figures will reignite the debate about mixed - ability classes which @entity22 and the @entity23 have both pledged to crack down on since 1997			1
critics say the lack of sets and streams in schools holds back the most able students			2
almost half of academic 11 - year - olds fail to get five or more @entity32 in academic subjects some 420 schools or sixth form colleges were also unable to produce a single student who gained three a-levels with grades of @entity39 or above in subjects preferred by leading universities			1
the worrying trends emerged in official figures which showed the number of under - performing schools has been slashed since the @entity46 took power			1
of the 3,200 state schools in @entity11 , 154 fell short of a government target for at least 40 per cent of pupils to get five good passes in gcses including @entity11 and maths – leaving them at risk of being closed or converted into academies			1
of the 160,000 pupils who gained good @entity7 results when they left primary school , 84,000 failed to achieve a c - grade or higher in core subjects but the figure was 61 fewer than the previous year , despite the benchmark being raised from 35 per cent of pupils			1
the improvement means 50,000 fewer children are trapped in sub-standard secondaries compared to last year , or 244,000 since 2010			0
education secretary @entity66 said the results were a ‘ credit to the professionalism and hard work of teachers ’			0
@entity72 effectively admitted mixed - ability teaching was a failure when he dropped the party ’s historic support for the practice in 1997			1
education ministers backed the line , saying separating pupils according to ability would ‘ raise standards ’			2
@entity83 also called for changes while in opposition , saying every comprehensive should have a ‘ grammar stream ’			0
but inspectors at the schools watchdog have found just 46 per cent of state school classes are divided into sets or streams – only a one percentage point improvement in 17 years			2
@entity94 mp @entity93 , who supports selective education , said : ‘ all of the evidence indicates that teaching by ability works best			2
that ’s true whether it ’s within a school through sets or streaming or between schools as a selective system			0
’ the league tables are based on data provided by the @entity108 and show how more than 4,000 schools and colleges in @entity11 performed at @entity111 , a-levels and other academic qualifications			0
the top - performing school for gcses was co-educational @entity116 in @entity118 , which had the best results for the second year in a row			0
the figure is 61 less than last year - an achievement education secretary @entity66 said was a ' credit to hard work of teachers ' the analysis also showed that 202,000 pupils were entered for the @entity17 compared to 130,000 in 2012 , showing schools are heeding government calls to ditch soft subjects such as drama and sociology for those better suited to higher education and the jobs markets			1
teachers ’ unions dislike league tables because they claim they do not accurately show how a school is performing and encourage staff to ‘ teach to the test ’			0
but @entity142 , professor of economics at the @entity143 , said : ‘ league tables play an important role in school standards			0
removing league tables reduces average school performance and raises inequality in attainment			0

about 84,000 out of 160,000 *schoolchildren* failed to get a c or higher
one in seven schools failed to produce @entity39 grades or above at a level in courses preferred by leading universities
figures will *reunite* government debate about mixed - ability classes
