ever spotted that friend who constantly moans and complains about their life on @entity3 ? worryingly , research suggests that those who describe themselves as lonely or depressed are more likely to share personal information			1
this includes details such as their favourite book or film to their relationship status and even their home address			1
a study by researchers at @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity14 suggests that users who describe themselves as ' lonely ' or ' depressed ' on @entity3 are more likely to share detailed personal information than those who are considered ' connected ' in total 616 female @entity3 users were profiled by scientists at @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity14			1
@entity3 came under fire last year for allowing teenagers to make public posts			2
before the update @entity3 prevented under 18s making posts public ; the widest audience they could reach was @entity30			0
in a blog post in october , @entity3 said : ' teens are among the savviest people using social media , and whether it comes to civic engagement , activism , or their thoughts on a new movie , they want to be heard			2
' so , starting today , people aged 13 through 17 will also have the choice to post publicly on @entity3			0
' according to the researchers , ‘ half ( 308 ) were categorised as “ connected ” and the remaining 308 users were categorised as “ lonely ” ; based on clearly stating this feeling in their latest wall posting			2
’ the study then monitored the publicly available aspects of the profile to see if there was a relationship between loneliness and self - disclosure			0
‘ the results of this study have shown that more “ lonely ” people disclosed their personal information , relationship information and address than “ connected ” people , ’ write the researchers			1
in fact , a huge 98 per cent of the users who described themselves as lonely listed their relationship status publicly			1
some even shared their home address			0
79 per cent of lonely users , meanwhile , disclosed other personal details such as their favourite film and book , compared to less than 65 per cent of connected users			1
‘ it makes sense that the people who felt lonely would disclose this type of information , ’ co-author of the study @entity77 tells @entity78			0
‘ they want to make it easier for others to initiate contact with them , which may help them overcome their feelings of loneliness			0
’ there have been several previous studies linking @entity3 with depression			2
in september 2013 , for example , it was found that online social media contributes to loneliness and reduces overall life - satisfaction , rather than making us feel connected this is just one of several studies linking @entity3 with depression or loneliness			1
in september 2013 , a study from the @entity100 psychologist dr @entity99 showed how online social media , rather than making us feel connected , contributes to loneliness and reduces overall life - satisfaction			1
according to the study , the technology is having a fundamentally negative effect on the way we interact with others , and the way we perceive ourselves			0
the study 's 82 participants were text messaged five times a day over a two - week period with a link to an online survey about their @entity3 use , their feelings of well - being and the amount of face - to - face social interaction they had engaged in			2
@entity122 and his team discovered that the more time participants had spent on @entity3 , the less happy they felt over time			0
' the more people used @entity3 at one time point , the worse they felt the next time we text - messaged them ; the more they used @entity3 over two weeks , the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time , ' reported the study .			0
