@entity8 , who was sent to prison during the @entity41 for publicly lecturing against the @entity42 entering the conflict , wrote the note to a critic called @entity46 @entity8 said the then prime minister @entity16 should dine with the leader of the @entity12 forces he wrote from his home in @entity53 , @entity54 : ' the general argument for pacifism is that more harm is done by fighting than by submitting to injustice			1
' i do not like this as an absolute principle , for example the amount of force required by the police in dealing with a burglar is not great enough to destroy civilised society			2
' but an unjustified attack by one great power on another is a different matter			2
' i will argue that if the @entity12 succeeded in sending an invading army to @entity75 we should do best to treat them as visitors , give them quarters , and invite the commander in chief to dine with the prime minister			1
such behaviour would completely baffle them			2
@entity8 was born at @entity82 on 18th may , 1872 , but by the age of three he was orphaned			1

in 1890 the social critic went into residence at @entity92 , @entity93 , and after achieving a @entity94 with distinction in philosophy degree he was elected a fellow of his college in 1895			2

' if , on the other hand , we fight them , we may win , or we may lose			0
if we lose , obviously no good as been done			0
' if we win , we shall inevitably , during struggle , acquire their bad qualities , and the world , at the end , will be no better off than if we had lost			0
' in the event , he went on to change his view that war was the lesser of two evils if it meant stopping @entity5 from taking over @entity38 and being a threat to democracy			0
@entity135 , of @entity136 , said : ' @entity8 was the most famous @entity4 philosopher of the 20th century and he wrote a history of western philosophy			1
' he was totally unafraid to express his opinions however cranky they might have been			0
' he had some strange ideas about society and family life and the @entity144 as well			0
' it is very striking to read it now and to think that such an intelligent person had such strange views			0
