there ’s no escaping the fact that @entity2 is n’t a complete engine overhaul – rather , a fine - tuned update			2
perhaps the most noticeable tweak , though , is just how more accessible @entity6 have made it compared to its intimidatingly time - consuming rival			2
on track : there 's plenty here for both hardcore fans of the sport and more causal gamers to enjoy for starters , there ’s the @entity18 mode – offering a compressed season that can be completed in just a few hours			1
or the pick - up and play scenario mode that pits your wits against 20 racing challenges			1
whereas its predecessor focused on its career experience ( which also returns in full force ) , it often involved dedicating a large period of time to play through it – scaring away some more casual gamers			1
@entity32 2013 suffers from no such issue , given the amount of short , fast - paced thrills on offer			2
and with superb graphics , commentary from @entity41 ' @entity40 and @entity42 and handling that ’s affected by both the finest set - up tweaks and changes in weather , there is plenty here for hardcore fans to enjoy , too			1
hard to master : handling is the toughest thing about @entity2 - and will take some time to get right a note about the handling , though			1
although last year 's edition went some way to allow for driver error , it will still take a lot of practise to ensure you do n't finish races with a 30 second penalty			0
the mind - numbing @entity63 goes some way to teach you the basics , and the rewind feature makes a return - but the latter still feels slightly out of place in a game that prides itself on delivering unparalleled authenticity			2
away from contemporary @entity2 , and there is the @entity75 mode - where you race some of the world 's best - known drivers of yesteryear around iconic circuits			1
the absence of @entity81 and @entity82 means driver skill and flair becomes more important than ever - and the cars feel noticeably more raw than today 's tamed beasts			0
coupled with commentary from @entity88 , and an optional retro tv filter and it makes for an incredibly authentic , high - speed journey back to the golden age of motorsport			0
authentic : every little detail of the cars have been painstakingly captured sadly , there are only a limited number of tracks that come with the standard edition of the game			0
for more classic cars , drivers and tracks you 'll have to buy the @entity106 or download it			1
aesthetic changes may be minimal - as expected in a yearly update - but overall presentation , much like the latest @entity110 incarnate , has improved - most noticeably in the soundtrack			1
multiplayer is catered for via split screen , system link or online while @entity115 lets you take on an entire season with a friend			0
brake point : the @entity63 goes some way to help but there 's no substitute for racing experience with next - gen consoles around the corner , it ’s only a matter of time before @entity32 games have the engine rebuild so many fans are waiting for			0
but for now , @entity2 is more than enough … @entity2 2013 is out on friday			0
agree with @entity130 ? follow us on @entity132 : @ @entity133 and on @entity134 : @entity135 .			0

@entity137 delivers *stunning* - if not *vastly* improved - *visuals*
much more friendly to casual gamers - plenty of game modes to enjoy
improved ai and brilliant @entity75 mode
for those *wanting* full access to all of the @entity150 mode content - you 'll have to buy the @entity106
handling still hard to master and @entity152 is very boring
improved overall presentation
