@entity0 have opened talks with @entity2 over a second new contract in two years			1
@entity2 made his first @entity0 appearance in 10 months following a serious knee injury , coming on as a late substitute in saturday ’s 3 - 0 win over @entity8			1
the @entity11 forward would enter the final year of his contract at the end of the season , a scenario @entity0 are keen to avoid , and they have held initial discussions regarding an extension			1
@entity2 ended a saga by signing a three - and - a - half - year extension in january 2013 worth around £ 90,000 per week			1
just 38 appearances later , @entity2 is on course for another			1
@entity23 confirmed : ‘ we are starting to sit down with him			1
he has one and a half years to go in december			0
it is never an easy job with him			0
' it should be his best years from now because he is 25 , so hopefully we can profit from that			0
‘ he is a unique player , a player who has been here a long time and who gives us something different			2
he has been tremendous for the last few seasons			0
to have him back can only be a bonus for me			0
’ @entity2 could feature again from the bench in the @entity45 clash against @entity18			1
the former @entity48 man ’s return to fitness comes as a huge boost to @entity23 , who is without six first - teamers due to injury , including @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
despite @entity2 ’s lack of match fitness the @entity0 manager says he is happy for him to report for international duty next week ahead of @entity11 ’s clashes against @entity61 and @entity62			1
‘ i ’m happy for him to go with @entity11 , he needs competition and games , ’ said the @entity63			2
‘ for us , he needs hard training			0
will i use him from the bench against @entity18 ? i have n’t decided yet			0
’ the @entity0 winger replaced @entity70 , pictured , against @entity8 on saturday @entity2 will be hoping to feature against @entity18 after coming on for the last 10 minutes at the weekend provided results go their way , @entity0 can secure their passage into the @entity45 knockout stages with two games to spare by beating @entity18 , but @entity23 insists his side will not take their foot off the gas during the final two group games as they look to clinch top spot above @entity81			1
@entity0 have finished second in their group in the previous two seasons , and both times they have been eliminated in the last 16 by @entity85			2
in 2011 they also finished second and ran into a @entity87 - inspired @entity86 in the first knockout round			2
@entity23 is determined to reduce the chances of meeting one of @entity92 ’s superpowers in the next round by finishing top of the group			2
‘ before , we played @entity85 twice , we played @entity86 as well , ’ said @entity23			2
‘ it is always better you finish first because in some way you feel guilty if you do n’t finish first and you think , if you are punished , it is down to you because you finished second			0
‘ let ’s do the job against @entity18 and then we will see			0
i believe every win makes you strong and every defeat makes you weaker , so no matter what happens we will try to play until the end			0
' it will be satisfying for me to qualify after four games , it will be job done			0
we want to take that opportunity , we are on a good run and we want to take advantage of that			0
@entity23 has revealed he would n't stop @entity2 linking up with @entity115 's @entity11 later this month @entity116 @entity54 @entity117 @entity53 @entity55 @entity118 ‘ they gave us a tough game in the first match			1
we had a bit of a miraculous win in @entity18 , needing to go into the last minute , but that was our quality in the game			0
‘ we have been warned			0
we learned a lot from the first game and now we want to win the game at the @entity131			0
’ @entity23 will go into tuesday 's clash without @entity116 who has picked up a virus			1
the @entity11 international , who is also suffering from a minor knee injury , missed monday 's training session but did report to the club ’s @entity139			1
the midfielder is expected to be fit for saturday ’s clash against @entity143 and for @entity11 duty next week			2
@entity23 revealed that @entity145 has also been ill over the past few days but said that no other @entity0 players have been affected by the bug			1
@entity23 has called on his players to claim all three points against @entity18 on tuesday night @entity150			2
