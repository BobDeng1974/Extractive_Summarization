call to action : the prime minister said today that @entity3 leader @entity2 had made it clear she was ' up for a coalition ' with the @entity6 @entity7 warned @entity8 that a vote for any party other than the @entity11 would let @entity12 into @entity13 - and allow @entity14 back into a position of power			1
the prime minister said today that @entity3 leader @entity2 had made it clear she was ' up for a coalition ' with the @entity6 in the event of a hung parliament			1
he added this would lead to the ' very real prospect ' of @entity14 , who is standing for election as an mp for the @entity8 nationalists this may , having the ' decisive say ' in the running of the country			1
mr @entity7 told the @entity32 conference : ' if you vote for anyone else apart from the @entity11 you are voting for this outcome : labour in government			1
@entity12 in @entity13 ... and the very real prospect of @entity14 coming in through the back door			1
' on the return of mr @entity14 , who is standing for election in @entity41 , mr @entity7 said that ' like a horror movie , he 's back '			1
the prime minister added : ' only this time he 's not running @entity8			1
he would have the decisive say in running a country he wants to see abolished , our @entity46			1
' he said it was ' appalling ' that @entity6 and mr @entity12 had failed to rule out doing a deal with the @entity3 in the event of a hung parliament , branding them ' spineless , weak , unprincipled , short - termist '			1
he told the conference : ' that is all anyone needs to know about today 's @entity6			2
' he added the @entity11 were the ' bedrock ' of the @entity57 campaign in the run - up to last september 's @entity8 independence referendum			2
but after ' battling ' to keep the @entity46 together , he warned that there was still a threat to @entity8 's future from the prospect of a @entity6 government			1
he told the conference ' a major risk to @entity8 's future remains ' from the economic policies of @entity6 if @entity68 succeed in becoming the chancellor after the election			1
he said : ' we fought to stop the risk of break - up			0
now we have to fight to stave off the risk of bankruptcy			0
' he hit out at the economic policies of @entity6 and the @entity3 , telling the conference : ' our opponents bleat on about " austerity " but i tell you - if we do n't grip these debts , they will grip us			2
' and there will be less and less money for our schools , hospitals , communities , pensions - for everything that makes life worthwhile			0
' after ms @entity2 made a speech in @entity92 where she blasted conservative spending cuts as ' morally unjustifiable ' , mr @entity7 hit back at the @entity3 leader			1
decisive say : @entity7 said if @entity6 was to come into power it would lead to the ' very real prospect ' of @entity14 , right , having the ' decisive say ' in the running of the country			1
left , @entity3 leader @entity2 ' i 'll tell you what is " morally unjustifiable " , first minister			2
and that is racking up more debt than our children and grandchildren could ever hope to re-pay			0
' passing the buck like every other hopeless left - wing administration in history			0
' and that 's why it will be us - the @entity115 - who will do the right thing , clear up this mess - and leave @entity8 standing taller			2
' the economic policies his party has pursued means ' we 'll be able to look our children and grandchildren in the eye and know we did the right thing '			0
in his speech today , mr @entity7 also defended the introduction of the benefits reforms introduced by the government , saying : ' we came in with a mission to restore the right values			2
' no more something for nothing			0
no more taking without contributing			0
above all - work must always pay			0
that 's what the benefit cap is about			0
that 's what @entity137 is about			0
' in a rallying cry mr @entity7 spoke about the country 's spirit which ' really makes @entity46 special '			1
he also praised aid workers such as @entity144 , who contracted @entity145 while volunteering in @entity146 , speaking about their ' spirit of compassion '			0
the prime minister told the conference : ' that is @entity46			2
no other country on earth has this combination of guts and grit , heart and brains			0
' and no other country on earth is such a powerful example of how people of all different faiths and beliefs and nationalities can live together			0
' none of us are just @entity169 , or @entity8 , or @entity170			2
or a @entity92 or a @entity171 , or @entity172 or @entity173			0
we 're all @entity46 too			0
' that 's what we are - all of us , whatever our background , wherever we 're from			0
warning : mr @entity7 , pictured today , said the @entity177 had ' battled ' to keep the @entity46 together , but warned that there was still a threat to @entity8 's future from the prospect of a @entity6 government ' and our goal in this party is to show people , over the coming weeks and months and years - how we take these ingredients and make our country an even better place to live			1
' but @entity3 deputy leader @entity189 said : ' the @entity177 have been rejected in election after election in @entity8 , and only a strong team of @entity193 will be able to exert power at @entity195 on behalf of the people of @entity8 - standing up for @entity8 interests , and opposing the @entity115 obsession with austerity			1
' the @entity177 are right to be concerned that a strong @entity3 vote will stand in the way of their damaging agenda - a poll earlier this month showed that people in @entity8 are backing the @entity3 to keep the @entity177 out of office			1
' mr @entity7 was also in @entity8 to announce the backing of @entity8 shipbuilding with an Â£ 859million investment in the next generation of @entity212 frigates to be built on the @entity213			2
the prime minister said the money will be spent on developing the @entity217 warship and sustain 1,700 jobs across the country .			0

@entity7 said @entity2 was ' up for ' coalition with @entity12
told @entity8 vote for any party other than @entity177 would let @entity6 into power
added it could lead to @entity14 having ' decisive say ' in running of @entity46
