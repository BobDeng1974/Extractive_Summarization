the @entity7 was billed as the ' @entity8 of kitchen appliances ' when it first rolled off the production line in 1950			2
@entity12 , 33 , bought one of the original models for just £ 15 over the internet because she could n't afford a new one			1
happy eater : @entity12 with one of @entity20 's oldest food mixers , which she bought for £ 15 online and says is better that a new one master mixer : its owner admits it will smoke a little when you turn it on , but once it warms up it is perfect for making breads and cakes the thrifty cafe worker now uses it to mix cakes , homemade bread and pizza dough at her home in @entity38 , @entity39 - and says she prefers it to newer models			1
@entity12 said : ' i saw a lady selling it for just £ 15 on a @entity45			1
i 've always wanted a heavy - duty mixer but could never afford it so i thought i 'd give this one a go			2
' i could tell it was going to be old - late seventies , early eighties , but i did n't expect it to be this old			2
' i do n't think it had been used for a very long time as it was found in a loft and was very dusty and when i first turned it on smoke came out of it			0
' occasionally now when i switch it on it will smoke for 30 seconds , but then it works perfectly			0
i love it - it was a real bargain as the new models can sell for up to £ 400			1
' completing the set : @entity12 also owns items from much earlier , including a grinder , a pepper mill and a 19th century cook book the @entity68 was developed by @entity69 in @entity20 and the first model - the @entity71 - went on sale in 1950 with an array of attachments to whisk , mix , mince and liquidise food			1
it was an instant success and after numerous models and updates is still @entity7 's top seller today			2
@entity12 uses other vintage items in her kitchen , including a coffee grinder which pre-dates @entity85 and a pepper grinder which belonged to her grandparents			1
she said : ' i 've got several antiques in my kitchen			0
i also have a 19th century cookbook which i 'll often use with my mixer			0
' i had a black and white tv until the mid 90s because it was still working			0
i do n't believe in throwing things away just because they 're old			0

cafe worker @entity12 bought the kitchen aid for £ 15 online
' i love it - it 's a real bargain as the new models can sell for £ 400 , ' she said
