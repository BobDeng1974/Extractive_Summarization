the @entity11 programme merges six benefits into one and is intended to simplify the system and make sure it always pays to be in work			1
but at a time when the government is trying to curb benefits spending , including a cap on how much families can receive , the idea of making it easier to apply for handouts is likely to prove controversial			0

’ he also raised ‘ the concerns and irritation of many people who go to work every day and pay their taxes but can not afford those kinds of luxuries ’			0
