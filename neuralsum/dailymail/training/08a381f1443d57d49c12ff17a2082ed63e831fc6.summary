for my first visit to @entity2 i headed to @entity3 and @entity4 for a ten - day break			1
i 'm not sure what i expected to find : @entity8 , of course ; the odd moose ; perhaps a bear - actually , to be honest , i did n't see any of these			1
@entity2 's a big country - the second - biggest in the world , and 45 times the size of the @entity14			1
the province of @entity4 alone is more than twice the size of @entity17 , but with a population of just 750,000			1
as i drove around , i began to wonder why they actually bothered to build roads because there was never anybody using them			2
it makes driving in @entity2 a sheer delight - especially where we were , in what they call the @entity29 , on the @entity31 coast			1
the country is stunningly , stunningly beautiful			1
my girlfriend @entity41 loved it			1
i was slightly nervous about the cost of filling it up , but i found out to my relief that fuel is a lot cheaper in @entity2			1
it was a journey of surprises , the first being that @entity2 was just a five - hour flight from @entity14 - i had no idea it would be such a short trip			1
another pleasant surprise was that the exchange rate with the @entity55 dollar is extremely favourable			0
and , perhaps most importantly for me after all my years as a @entity58 judge , the food is incredible			1
lobsters and scallops are luxury items in the @entity14 , but in this part of @entity2 they are very affordable			1
you find little wood cabins by the side of the road that do lobster rolls and fresh scallops			0
a gourmand would gorge himself silly - and we did just that for the first week , eating nothing but lobster			2
and the people are unbelievably friendly			2
i 'll give you two examples of this			0
i went to buy some indigestion tablets from the drugstore ( it 's an anxiety thing - nothing to do with all that lobster ! )			2
a gourmand 's paradise : @entity84 holds up a lobster , which is part of the staple diet in @entity2 an older couple in the shop heard my accent and said to me : ' you do n't need to buy a whole tub , you wo n't be here that long			1
we 're buying some - just take some from our bottle ! ' these were two people i 'd never met before			2
and what about this ? when i was reversing my mighty truck , i accidentally backed into a ditch			0
suddenly i was surrounded by people eager to help me			0
somebody pulled up in the car behind			0
a woman came out of her house across the road			0
they all began making phone calls			0
i was pulled out by a tow - truck within 30 minutes , and the guy charged me less than £ 30			2
i could n't believe how ridiculously friendly they were			2
on the road , everyone is so well behaved			0
i 've never been on a road where nobody speeds			0
there 's an official speed limit and absolutely no one exceeds it			0
i imagine that nobody can get frustrated , or nobody feels the need to go fast , because everyone 's moving all the time			0
the only thing that slowed me down was the need to stop to take photographs			0
hitting the open road : a lack of cars makes driving in @entity2 a sheer delight in @entity4 you can feel the @entity132 influence in the food			1
this is where the @entity135 lived before they were expelled by the @entity14 and went to live in @entity137 , where they gave the world jambalaya and file gumbo			0
you can see why the @entity132 were reluctant to abandon this part of @entity2			1
i took home so many wonderful experiences			0
one of the most amazing in @entity3 was riding the tidal bore at @entity145			1
i do n't really understand how tides work , so i ca n't explain the whole tidal bore phenomenon - all i know is that it 's an extraordinary thing to see			2
the @entity145 is a 170 - mile long ocean bay that stretches between the provinces of @entity4 and @entity3 , and it 's home to the highest tides in the world			1
each day 160billion tons of seawater flows in and out of the bay during one tide cycle , more than the combined flow of all the world 's freshwater rivers			2
surf ’s up : tourists hang on tightly as they ride the 10ft - high @entity145 tidal bore on the @entity162 river on the @entity162 , the tide is coming in one way , and the pull of the river is going the other , and it creates what they call the tidal bore - angry waves , up to 10ft high , that can start anywhere in the river and come from any direction			1
i was put in a lifejacket and taken out to the river in an inflatable boat - and then we sat in the middle of these rapids , with the boat 's engine off watching these enormous waves starting to build			2
it was like riding a big dipper			0
it 's scary at first			0
the boat fills with water and you all sit at the back to empty it out			0
then you all sit at the front so that it stays down			0
it 's the most amazing thing			0
you would n't think ' @entity84 , adrenaline junkie ' , would you ? but i loved it			0
another great pleasure - and another surprise - was the wine in this part of @entity2			1
a lot of it is quite sweet for our palate , but you 've got to applaud the ingenuity of a country that 's warm in the summer and then freezing in the winter being able to produce wine at all			2
stunning scenery : a waterfall in @entity4 and , right , the impressive @entity209 i could n't believe the stunning beauty of the area			1
as i went along , i was busy posting photographs on @entity213 - i just had to share the experience			2
there 's an area called @entity209 , where you stare down at a seascape with rocks sticking out of it			0
within an hour or so , the tide has gone out so far that you can walk along what was the seabed and past these rocks that have been eroded into bizarrely beautiful shapes by the tides			0
in the last decade of the 19th century , sir @entity225 , a wealthy businessman who was president of @entity226 , had a summer home in @entity4 , on @entity228 near @entity229			1
the island is connected to the mainland by a causeway that 's flooded for half the day			2
his place , @entity228 , was a sandstone mansion furnished in the most lavish late @entity236 manner , with manicured grounds , scenic roads and greenhouses turning out exotic fruits and vegetables , as well as a breeding farm producing prize - winning @entity243 horses and @entity247 cattle			2
it was the most spectacular of many palatial summer homes in @entity229			0
i was invited to the property by @entity251 , a local chef , who cooked an eight - course dinner just for me and @entity41			1
he also brought wine to go with every course			0
romantic : @entity84 had dinner at sir @entity225 's former summer home on @entity228 i 've eaten in a fair number of places around the world , but this meal on @entity228 was one of the culinary highlights of my life			1
we had local scallops , done ceviche - style and local halibut			1
here we were , sitting in what was a @entity268 bathhouse , overlooking the sunset , having a chef prepare our dinner			1
this was not only a culinary highlight , it was also immensely , incredibly romantic			1
my overriding memory of my time in @entity2 is of lovely towns and wonderfully empty space			1
@entity4 and @entity3 are only five to eight per cent populated , leaving space for beautiful forests			1
@entity2 also represents wonderful value for money			1
at the moment , a dollar is about 65p , so a main course in the poshest restaurant is going to cost you around £ 15			0
do n't go there expecting sophistication			0
go there expecting just a rural idyll			0
i 'd go back at the drop of a hat			0
for now i 'm making arrangements for chef @entity251 to come over to @entity293 , which he has never visited			2
because i was so overwhelmed by what he 'd done for me that night , i 'm going to take him to @entity296 , my favourite restaurant in @entity293 , as a thank you			0
