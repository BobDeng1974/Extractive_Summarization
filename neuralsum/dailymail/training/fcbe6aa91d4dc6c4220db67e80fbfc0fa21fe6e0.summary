@entity35 hopes the advanced imaging equipment in the lab , including a ct scanner attached to a robotic arm , can help it create @entity41 pictures of its spacesuits that can be used to better diagnose malfunctions that might happen in the future			0
@entity8 , the @entity10 astronaut who survived the harrowing experience with the spacesuit , said the work @entity35 and the hospital are doing is a step forward in preventing others from going through what he faced			1
' i never thought about seeing a spacesuit lying on a surgeon 's table			2
' that is a first for me , ' said @entity8 , as he stood next to the spacesuit , which was not the same one he wore during the spacewalk			2
the imaging technology was demonstrated on the spacesuit during ' @entity61 , ' an annual conference that brings three of @entity64 's biggest industries — medicine , energy and aerospace — together to discuss technologies that could be shared by the fields			0

' during a demonstration monday at the conference , the robotic arm rotated the @entity113 around the spacesuit 's helmet , creating red , black and white @entity41 images that can allow engineers to look at the integrity of different components			2
dr. @entity120 , the medical director of the @entity121 and @entity122 who led the demonstration , said techniques used in endovascular surgery to examine problems with blood vessels are the same kind that can diagnose future problems with the spacesuits			0
