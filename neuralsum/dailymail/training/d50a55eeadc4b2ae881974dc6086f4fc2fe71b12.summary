@entity0 has faced little competition for his @entity3 place since he took over the no 1 jersey in 2010			1
but that might be about to change			0
saturday afternoon saw two @entity3 goalkeepers go head - to - head and both kept clean sheets			1
@entity9 for @entity10 and @entity11 for @entity12 in a 0 - 0 draw on the south coast			1
in fact this also happened as recently as february when @entity17 were held goalless at @entity18 with @entity0 in one goal and @entity20 in the other			2
after being cruelly left at home in the summer , @entity20 is now in the championship and seemingly out of the @entity3 picture for the moment			0
@entity26 : @entity0 has been unchallenged as @entity3 's no 1 goalkeeper for some time contender : @entity11 kept a clean sheet on saturday as @entity12 earned a point at @entity10 in the running : @entity9 has the chance to stake his claim by playing for @entity10 in the top flight so what of the other two ? @entity11 is a @entity36 favourite from their time together at the @entity38 – why else would a player who deserted @entity3 , and before that failed to grasp a fantastic opportunity at @entity42 when @entity43 gave him a chance , jump instantly to the no 2 spot with his country ? @entity11 regularly makes some good saves for @entity12 , to be fair , but as we saw when he had a rush of blood and wrongly chose to race out to the edge of his box in the first - half on saturday , he ’s capable of a cock - up			1
age is n’t on @entity11 ’s side compared with @entity0 and @entity9 – even if he takes his game up a level it ’s unlikely he will get a move to a top club in the @entity61 at this stage of his career			2
plenty to ponder : @entity36 will soon select his squad for the first @entity67 qualifier with @entity68 goalkeepers ' union : @entity11 and @entity9 embrace after saturday 's match ends in a goalless stalemate @entity9 is a different case , and in many ways an unknown quantity			1
if @entity36 can ignore his bias towards @entity11 then the @entity10 keeper has a chance of staking a claim of being the main challenger to @entity0			1
@entity9 had largely been untested in the @entity81 during his time with @entity83 , but certain @entity61 performances have made people pay attention , and persuaded @entity10 to pay £ 10m for the big man from @entity88			2
i expect @entity9 to be given a busy time at @entity10 this season , and if he comes up with some stand - out , points - saving performances , he will be hard to ignore			2
commanding : @entity0 comes out to punch the ball clear under pressure in @entity17 's 3 - 1 win over @entity96 on monday night competition : @entity0 knows he needs to be on top form to keep @entity99 out of the @entity17 side @entity0 needs to stay focused – something he did n’t do at the start of last season			1
he has @entity99 – a @entity104 favourite – breathing down his neck at club level so he ca n’t afford to make mistakes			0
if his form slips , he ’ll be left out at @entity17 in a heartbeat ( excuse the pun )			0
when he was dropped by @entity104 last season , @entity0 kept his place in the @entity3 team			0
but only because there were no alternatives @entity36 could justifiably turn to			0
@entity9 is a serious alternative			0
he needs to have a big first season in the @entity117 with @entity10 .			0

@entity0 has been unchallenged for some time as @entity3 's goalkeeper
but @entity11 at @entity12 and @entity9 at @entity10 are both starting to show good @entity117 form
both kept clean sheets when the two sides met on saturday
@entity11 is a @entity36 favourite after time together at the @entity38
@entity0 is under pressure from @entity99 at @entity17
