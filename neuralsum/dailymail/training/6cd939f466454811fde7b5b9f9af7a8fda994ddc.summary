by @entity0 a gypsy homeowner who was refused permission to build a caravan site in his back garden is attempting to bypass planning laws by having it declared as an official campsite			0
@entity8 , 45 , wanted to put three caravans containing two gypsy households on green belt land at the back of his detached home in @entity14 , near @entity15			1
after more than 70 angry residents complained at a public meeting the plans were thrown out by @entity19 on august 13 last year			1
@entity21 view of mr @entity8 's @entity23 home ( circled ) , in @entity14 , @entity24 however , the row has now taken a bizarre turn with mr @entity8 submitting plans to have the two acres of land declared a campsite with the @entity30 and @entity31			1
the site - which is in a residential area of the @entity24 village - will also take up to five caravans or motor - homes along with 10 tents			0
but yesterday furious residents accused mr @entity8 of ' trying it on ' saying that nobody would ever visit @entity15 for a camping holiday anyway			1
councillor @entity42 , chairman of @entity43 , said : ' mr @entity8 has failed in his efforts to get planning from the council so this is his way of getting around that			2
@entity8 wanted to put three caravans containing two gypsy households on green belt land ' it is important people in the area know what is going on so they can take the opportunity to put their view across			1
' it is also highly unlikely the @entity30 and @entity31 are aware of the history of the site so i will be sending them a full copy of the planning committee ’s last report			0
' councillor @entity42 said a petition opposing the plan has been signed by 135 residents and 16 letters of objection had also been received			0
villagers had objected to the caravans being situated on green belt land and said they were also concerned about increased traffic			1
villagers had objected to the caravans being situated on green belt land behind the house ( circled ) @entity23 resident @entity81 , 48 , said : ' if they want to live as a traveller they should n’t be living in the back garden in a residential lane			1
' if this is agreed and it went ahead it would set a precedent			0
' rather than stay in a nursing home people will say they may as well stay in a back garden			0
' @entity93 , 56 , whose house backs onto mr @entity8 ’s property said : ' nobody wants the loss of green belt land			1
' we are concerned about the impact on the environment and about the loss of views			0
' furious residents who live near mr @entity8 's house ( pictured ) have accused mr @entity8 of ' trying it on ' local hairdresser @entity107 , 44 , added : ' it ’s just a ploy to get around the councils decision , there is now way there is any other reason for it			2
' who on earth is going to come to @entity15 for a camping holiday ? he is just trying it on			0
' @entity118 , membership services director at the @entity30 and @entity31 , said : ' when a certified site is applied for , the club always consults with local residents and authorities as to whether the location should receive a certificate from us and we will continue to follow this process in this instance			2
' residents have been given 28 days to comment on the application prior to the @entity30 and @entity31 making their decision			2
mr @entity8 was unavailable for comment today .			0
