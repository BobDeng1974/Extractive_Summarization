the report , published by the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , also claimed that girls who are born in 2057 could potentially live to an average age of 116			1
out of the 374,000 men and 393,000 women aged 65 this year , around 8 per cent of men and 14 per cent of women are expected to reach 100			1
but the @entity7 has predicted that 30 per cent of boys and 39 per cent of girls born in 2013 will live to 100			1
and incredibly , they said a generation of girls born in 2057 could have an average life expectancy of 116 if all the most optimistic health forecasts prove to be correct – although they admitted the prediction should be treated ‘ with caution ’			0
the @entity7 report said there are currently 14,000 people in the @entity25 who are 100 or over , compared to just 600 in 1961			1
@entity26 called the figure , which has been steadily rising , ‘ almost beyond belief ’			0

‘ in terms of pension policy , we appear to have woken up rather late in the day to the need to try to address the ever - growing savings gap , and with it the likelihood of an impoverished old age for potentially millions of people in later life			0
’ pensions minister @entity74 said : ‘ the age we get our state pension has to reflect rises in longevity to make sure our system remains fair and affordable for future generations			0
