by @entity0 the stark difference in the health of @entity3 and @entity4 was laid bare again today after alarming life expectancy figures were revealed			0
a person living in @entity7 is four times more likely to die early - before the age of 75 - from heart disease than someone living in leafy @entity12			1
the statistics , released by the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , show an ‘ unacceptable ’ divide in the heart health of the nation - leading to ‘ shocking inequalities ’ in the number of deaths from heart and circulatory disease , the charity says			1
figures from the @entity14 show ' shocking inequalities ' in the number of deaths from heart ( cardiovascular ) disease			1
@entity32 shows where people are more likely to die prematurely from @entity35 ( marked in deep red for between 95 and 144 people per 100,000 ) through to areas where people are the least likely to die before the age of 75 from @entity35 ( marked in the lightest shade of red for between 35 and 61 people per 100,000 ) the charity has released a list of the places with the highest and lowest death rates for cardiovascular disease ( @entity35 )			1
across the @entity49 , around 100 people under the age of 75 die from the condition every day			0
it accounts for more than one in four of all @entity49 deaths			0
the statistics reveal that in @entity7 , 144 people out of every 100,000 under the age of 75 prematurely die from @entity35 , while only 40 out of every 100,000 in @entity55 , @entity12 , prematurely die because of such problems			2
other places listed as having high death rates include @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , the charity found			1
in @entity59 , 134 people out of 100,000 die prematurely from @entity35 , and in @entity60 125 people in every 100,000 succumb to the disease before the age of 75			1
on the other end of the scale , parts of @entity12 , @entity68 and @entity69 have the lowest death rates from heart disease in the under - 75s			1
in all these places , between 35 and 47 people in every 100,000 under the age of 75 prematurely die from the condition			0
‘ these figures are a stark reminder of the unacceptable number of people that lose their lives to cardiovascular disease every year , often increased by the place they live , ’ said @entity14 chief executive @entity78			2
the five areas where people are most likely to die from heart disease before 75			2
@entity7 leads the way with 144 people out of every 100,000 dying prematurely			0
to compare , in @entity55 , @entity12 , only 40 out of every 100,000 die early for this reason parts of @entity12 , @entity68 and @entity69 have the lowest death rates from @entity35 in under 75s			1
in all these places , between 35 and 47 people in every 100,000 died early ‘ there is still so much more we need to do			0
we ’ve made huge progress in the fight against cardiovascular disease , with 70 per cent of heart attack victims now surviving to go home to their families			0
‘ with the help of our supporters , we ’ll increase investment and accelerate our world - class research that could save the lives of more people that die prematurely			0
we remain determined to win the fight against cardiovascular disease , improving the lives of the seven million people living with it and saving those that currently die too young			0
’ in its new strategy , the charity has said the key to preventing more premature deaths is to make sure research advancements go further and faster			0
it aims to tackle health inequalities by preventing people from developing @entity35 in the first place , which could help reduce early deaths from the disease by 25 per cent by 2025 – the equivalent to 10,000 lives a year			2
the latest figures uncovered by the charity show ' shocking inequalities ' in the number of deaths from heart and circulatory disease , which claims 440 lives in the @entity49 every day			1

@entity14 said divide in @entity49 *'s* heart health is ' unacceptable '
figures show ' shocking inequalities ' in deaths from heart disease
@entity7 tops list of places with highest death rates for the condition
@entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 also have high death rates
@entity12 , @entity68 and @entity69 have lowest rates from condition
