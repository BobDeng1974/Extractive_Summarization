but now , they are being urged to talk to the women in their lives about their unhealthy habits and waistlines			0
it is hoped this will reduce the number of women dying from heart disease			1
the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) said too few women are aware that it is the biggest killer of women and more needs to be done to raise awareness that it is not just a man 's disease			1
heart and circulatory disease kills more than 80,000 women in the @entity34 each year and 17.3 million women worldwide			2
in the @entity34 , 3.5 million women are living with some form of heart or circulatory problem			2
the warning has been issued to mark @entity41 today			0
@entity42 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity2 , said : ‘ too few women realise that heart and circulatory disease is their biggest killer			1
‘ i hope people will use @entity41 as their prompt to have a straightforward conversation with the woman they love about her heart health			0
‘ ignorance is fuelling women 's heart risk			2
so while our ask is simple , the impact really could save lives			0
‘ on a day when women are thinking and talking about how to improve their lives , we also want them to include one , potentially life - saving , conversation with another woman they love about how they look after their heart			2
‘ sadly , most women are oblivious to the fact that heart problems are the biggest killer of women in the @entity34			1
‘ if more women knew they were at risk , they could do something about it , whether that 's losing a bit of weight , quitting smoking or just taking the dog out for longer walks			0

shaping up : the charity is worried that too many women see heart disease as a man 's disease even though it is the @entity34 's biggest killer of women the condition causes chest pain , heart attacks and heart failure			1
it occurs when the heart 's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build - up of fatty substances in the arteries			0
this can be caused by smoking , high cholesterol , high blood pressure and diabetes			0
the best prevention methods are healthy eating , being physically active , giving up smoking , and controlling sugar levels .			0
