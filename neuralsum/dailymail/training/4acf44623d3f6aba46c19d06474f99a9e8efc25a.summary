by @entity0 published : 07:01 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 12:43 est , 3 january 2014 a group of gypsies who were facing eviction from their illegal camp are claiming it would breach their childrens ' human rights if they are forced to move on			2
the 78 @entity9 travellers - who hail from just four families - were told to leave their camp in @entity12 , @entity13 , by the @entity14 in october			1
a four - year legal battle has already left taxpayers with an estimated legal bill of £ 200,000			1
eviction : the gypsies moved onto the site in @entity12 , @entity13 , overnight in a ' military - style operation ' four years ago - after the council offices had closed for the weekend appeal : the group are applying to the @entity25 for permission to appeal their case			1
they claim eviction would breach the human rights of 39 children living on the land but they are now applying for permission to take their case to the @entity25 which will delay their possible eviction further			1
they have argued that being kicked off the land would ' violate ' the human rights of their 39 children living on the site as their health and educational prospects would be adversely affected			1
the gypsies moved in four years ago after launching what neighbours said was a ' military - style operation ' after the council offices had closed for the weekend in november 2009			1
one local said : ' if these people had been good neighbours then we would have been happy to accommodate them but the fact is they have been terrible neighbours			0
' the site is a terrible mess , their dogs are forever barking and they have generators running all night			2
' the villagers have complained about these people poaching rabbiting and roaming all over their land then harassing them and being rude when told to behave			0
' the numbers of travellers there changes all of the time			0
at times there has been up to 60 caravans on the land			0
they are illegally there and their behaviour has been hugely disruptive			0
' the @entity14 ruled that there could be no further appeals - but lawyers for the travellers applied to the @entity25 for permission for the case to be heard			1
gypsy site : the council has spent £ 200,000 attempting to evict the travellers from the site which has been given its own postcode - enabling the inhabitants to claim benefits it had been hoped that enforcement action could begin today but the attempt to appeal has delayed it			1
@entity85 , chief executive of @entity86 , said they had spent £ 200,000 fighting the case			1
inspectors have been carrying out weekly visits to the site and said over @entity92 there were 43 caravans present			2
mr @entity85 said : ' we are so frustrated with the legal system that is allowing this to continue			0
when we had to tell the residents they were distraught			0
we now have to face yet another legal process and it is so frustrating			0
' we were told by the @entity102 that there was no possibility of further appeal but they have found a loophole and the @entity25 is now considering a possible appeal			1
' we have been advised that any action we take would be unsafe until everything has resolved itself			0
gypsy site : the camp , which shot up overnight in november 2009 , is situated on the outskirts of @entity12 , @entity13 ' this is a fight that has taken more than four years and cost taxpayers more than £ 200,000			1
it has been out of our hands for three years			2
' but now to hear that there are more delays is difficult to take			0
it is totally irrelevant that the people concerned are travellers			0
they have broken the law and set up a camp on the land			0
they are using expert lawyers to drag the situation on			0
' the saga began in november 2009 after a field in the village - which featured in @entity133 ’s @entity132 - was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from @entity136			1
the group of 30 adults and 40 children - mainly from @entity9 and @entity141 families - moved in and immediately began work laying foundations under outdoor spot lights			1
the council were later granted an injunction banning the travellers from bringing more caravans onto the land			2
in 2010 , the site was given a postcode after the travellers applied to the court saying they needed it to help fire and ambulance crews find them in an emergency			1
the ruling also meant they could apply for state benefits , plus utilities including gas electricity and water			0
gypsy site : the group were supposed to leave by today but have stayed put while they wait to see whether the @entity25 will consider their case the travellers then applied for planning permission to stay on the fields for good and proposed to install further utility buildings , cesspools , fencing and hardstandings			1
@entity86 refused the group retrospective planning permission and issued an enforcement notice instead demanding that they move off the site			1
an inspector at a planning inquiry also ruled that they had to leave			2
the group were given until last july to quit - but lodged an appeal at the last moment			2
in october @entity184 , sitting in the @entity14 , ruled the visual impact on the previously unspoilt landscape , road safety concerns and the site ’s large scale compared to the nearby village , outweighed the group ’s pressing need for a stable home			1
he ruled no further appeals could be heard			0
but on november 5 the travellers asked for permission to take their case to the @entity25			1
the court does not recovene until january 13			0
members of the gypsy group have said they have been given ' no option ' but to keep fighting			2
in a statement @entity204 said : ' we will stay until the bitter end			0
the council is saying we have to leave but they have offered us nowhere else to go			2
' there ’s a lot of kids and elderly people but none of that has been taken into consideration			0

@entity217 moved on to site in ' military - style ' operation overnight four years ago - after council offices had closed for the weekend
they were ordered to leave the site by the @entity14
but they have now applied to the @entity25 for permission to appeal
' health and education of children will be affected if they are ordered to leave '
@entity86 has spent £ 200,000 fighting the case since november 2009
