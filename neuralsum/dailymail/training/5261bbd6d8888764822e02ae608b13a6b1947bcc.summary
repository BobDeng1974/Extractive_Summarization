by @entity0 published : 03:14 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 03:43 est , 22 may 2013 the @entity2 boss of @entity3 in @entity4 has launched a blistering attack against @entity7 red tape which he says doubles the cost of building a car by adding nearly £ 6,000 to the bill			1
@entity11 , executive vice president of @entity3 and president of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , made his remarks at ‘ the @entity19 ’ summit held at the @entity18 , in @entity20			1
he said : ‘ @entity7 regulations add approximately £ 6,000 to the cost of an average car			2
' they make it approximately twice as expensive as it otherwise would be			0
@entity11 , the @entity2 boss of @entity3 in @entity4 , has launched an attack against @entity7 red tape ' they should not be implemented without proper consideration of their implications for the competitiveness of @entity4 manufacturers			1
’ highlighting the @entity2 government 's emphasis on free trade during its @entity38 presidency , mr @entity11 warned that existing ‘ unbalanced ’ free trade agreements with @entity40 had exacerbated problems of surplus capacity in @entity4 and had failed to reduce trade imbalances			1
if the same mistakes are made with a planned free - trade agreement with @entity47 , a @entity4 manufacturing recovery could be threatened still further			1
mr @entity11 said : ‘ in the three year period from july 2009 to june 2012 , @entity40 imported 207,000 vehicles from @entity4			1
' in the same period , @entity4 imported nearly a million vehicles from @entity40			1
that ’s nearly five times as many			2
@entity11 said @entity7 red tape adds approximately £ 6,000 to the cost of an average car ‘ this particular playing field sometimes feels as if it ’s been built on the side of a mountain			1
the free trade agreement with @entity40 does not and , on account of its lack of balance , can not work in its current form			1
’ using a cricketing metaphor to describe the actions of the @entity7 and @entity2 governments he said : ‘ we are at the crease with our bats broken in advance by the administrators of our own cricket club			0
we are at risk of serious injury and it is time to suspend play			0
’ he said : ' when @entity38 leaders gather in @entity79 next month , free trade will be high on the agenda – particularly between the @entity7 and the @entity81 and potentially between @entity4 and @entity47			2
‘ we believe in free trade because we believe in economic growth			0
but to work , free trade agreements must be fair and properly implemented			0
and sadly , this is not always the case			0
’ he said that five weeks ago , negotiations began on another free trade agreement , this time between the @entity7 and @entity47 : ' once bitten , twice shy			0
we are extremely concerned about the possible outcome			0
’ he said : ' the last thing we need is for @entity47 to exacerbate surplus capacity in @entity4 by flooding the market with products that are surplus to demand			2
' this is surplus capacity from a market protected through non-tariff barriers and a managed exchange rate			0
‘ so , we ask the @entity100 to respect its commitment to suspend negotiations if @entity47 does not deliver on its promise to dismantle non-tariff barriers			0
