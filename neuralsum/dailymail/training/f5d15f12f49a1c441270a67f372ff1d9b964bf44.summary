a girl who was given no chance of survival before she was born has stunned doctors by growing into a healthy six - year - old			1
@entity5 weighed just 1lb 11oz when she arrived 14 weeks early following a range of life - threatening complications in the womb			1
her devastated mother , @entity9 , 28 , was even told where she could bury her child after the placenta ruptured just 16 weeks into her pregnancy			1
@entity5 ( pictured with her mother , @entity9 ) , six , was given no chance of survival when the placenta ruptured 16 weeks into her mother 's pregnancy the complications continued and miss @entity9 ’s waters began to leak at 21 weeks			1
she also needed eight blood transfusions , and contracted life - threatening infections group b streptococcus and @entity25 - both of which were passed on to her unborn baby			1
but against all odds , @entity5 kept up her fight in the womb until 26 weeks , when a doctor told miss @entity9 he had never see a baby born alive following so many problems			1
now aged six , @entity5 , who was expected to be blind and brain damaged and who spent three years in and out of hospital with chronic lung conditions , is a picture of health			1
she has even taken up @entity42			0
miss @entity9 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , said : ‘ @entity5 was definitely meant to be here			1
she ’s a little fighter - literally			2
‘ she is such a feisty , outgoing little girl and has overcome so much			0
’ after her birth , @entity5 spent four months clinging to life in two different hospitals , in @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity5 survived the placenta rupturing but was in danger again when her mother 's waters began to leak at 21 weeks			1
things got worse when ms @entity9 contracted two infections , both of which were passed onto @entity5 eventually , @entity5 was born 14 weeks early and spent four months in hospital			1
she also had to be on a ventilator for a week and had to have three blood transfusions weighing just 1lb 11oz , she was so small her mother could cup her tiny body in her hands			1
but despite her minute size , @entity5 - whose middle name is @entity67 - put up a big fight as she battled a bleed on her brain , superbug @entity25 , and group b streptococcus , which affects just one in 2,000 babies			1
the bacteria is found in one in three women and normally has no effect on babies			0
@entity5 also spent a week on a ventilator , had a hole in her heart and needed three blood transfusions			1
even when she was allowed home from hospital after 16 weeks , it was feared she would be blind			1
her parents also had to be trained how to resuscitate @entity5 , who spent a year on oxygen , as her lungs were so underdeveloped			2
ms @entity9 says she sees @entity5 as a ' little miracle ' because she survived against the odds when she was born , @entity5 weighed just 1lb 11oz and she spent her first three years in and out of hospital but the youngster , who has also battled countless chest infections and pneumonia , has astounded medics and her parents with her incredible resilience			1
and as she approaches her seventh birthday next month , miss @entity95 said : ‘ every time it ’s her birthday it reminds us of how lucky we are			0
‘ all though my pregnancy i was constantly being told that they did n’t think she was going to make it			0
i was even told about the cemetery for babies who did n’t survive			0
despite everything she went through , @entity5 is now a healthy six - year - old ‘ even when she was discharged from hospital after almost four months she was showing no signs of being able to see at all			1
she had to be seen by an eye doctors for a year			0
that was one of the biggest worries			0
‘ now we are just so grateful she is here and so happy and healthy			2
she has done so well			0
’ miss @entity9 and @entity5 ’s father , @entity115 , 38 , were originally told she was suffering a miscarriage when she started to bleed at 16 weeks			1
and for the next seven weeks they were regularly told the pregnancy was not going to last 23 weeks , when there would be a slim chance @entity5 would be able to thrive outside the womb			2
but against the odds , at 23 weeks miss @entity9 , an adult nursing student , was transferred 70 miles from the @entity123 to @entity51 , where @entity5 arrived three weeks later			1
recalling what happened , miss @entity9 said : ‘ i was in the labour ward regularly because of the contraction pains i was getting			2
then when i was in the antenatal ward one day i stood up to go to the toilet and she was basically there			0
‘ she was n’t at all where she needed to be and they had to wrap her up in tin - foil and rush her to the resuscitation room			2
‘ i thought i had lost her			0
i was really worried because she was blue and floppy and not breathing			0
but they came back after three hours and told me she was alive and they had managed to get her stable			0
’ the doctors had to resuscitate the tiny newborn and insert drains in her lungs to give her a fighting chance			0
miss @entity9 said : ‘ when we finally got to see her she was really red and there were loads of tubes , monitors and beeping and every time we heard a beep i began to panic			2
‘ we were told she was getting the maximum amount of treatment she could get and for the first few days it did n’t look like she was going to make it			0
’ ms @entity9 said : ' @entity5 was definitely meant to be here			1
she 's a little fighter - literally ' but after a week on a ventilator she was well enough to be transferred from @entity51 ’s @entity153 to the @entity154 at @entity155 , where she spent the next 15 weeks			1
miss @entity9 said : ‘ i spent weeks sitting by her incubator			2
i remember her hands were absolutely tiny , but totally perfect			0
‘ after she was born her weight dropped to 1lb 6oz but by the time we got out of hospital she was 7lb			2
‘ she had quite a lot of problems until she was about three years old			0
but now nothing is holding her back			0
‘ when she first started school i could n’t believe it			2
not just that she had survived , but that she had no disabilities and was able to go			0
it was really an emotional day			0
‘ the doctor said he had never actually seen so many factors that resulted in a live birth before			0
she really is a little miracle			0
