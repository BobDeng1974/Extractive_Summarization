by @entity0 i could never understand why there was a debate about @entity4			1
of course he had to be in the @entity7 squad – now can he force his way into the team ? that is the challenge for @entity4 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
i hope we get to see plenty of them in @entity16			0
@entity12 may have to be patient behind @entity17 , but @entity4 and @entity11 have proven this season in the @entity19 that they can be game - changers			1
@entity4 has scored dazzling goals for his club , against @entity23 and then @entity24 , when the @entity26 manager was watching him			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity4 and @entity11 showing their skills in @entity26 training bamboozling : @entity4 can run with the ball with speed and that alarms opponents the fast show : @entity11 's lightning pace can frighten the life out of opposition defences dazzling : @entity4 has scores some superb goals for @entity40 , including this solo strike against @entity23 @entity43 strike : @entity11 has weighed in with crucial goals this season , including this one against @entity46 @entity0 predicted his @entity26 squad earlier this month , and was just one out ( but who was it ? ) he has been well managed by his @entity40 manager , @entity50 , who has rested him at times			1
that is the sign of a manager putting the development of a young player first			0
at his best , he runs with the ball at speed , can break the lines and bamboozle defenders			0
there is no point in @entity26 going to the finals , playing meekly and not laying a glove on any opponents			0
so let ’s pick players who can damage our group rivals and beyond			1
defenders do not like to deal with pace and dare – and this squad has plenty of that			2
we saw how easy it was for @entity76 to pick off @entity26 and to play through them at the @entity77			2
the veteran @entity79 maestro is a magnificent holding midfielder , but will he be as comfortable if he has direct and explosive pace running at him ? patience is a virtue : @entity12 ( left ) may have to wait for his chance behind @entity17 at left back @entity26 have players here who can move across the ground quickly with the ball			1
not just @entity11 and @entity4 , but also @entity87			1
he has enjoyed a brilliant season for his club and is now going on to the world stage			0
it is an exciting squad			2
there are similarities with the age profile of the squad for @entity96 , a squad that lifted the nation and included young players who operated without fear			1
that ’s what i want from this group , too			0
when i named my predicted squad last week , it included 22 of the 23 @entity107 named yesterday			1
my only change would have been @entity109 for @entity110 , who has had a poor season			0
@entity107 obviously knows him after working with him at @entity112 , so he trusts him			2
@entity110 can also cover at full back			0
there is enough experience there too , with @entity117 and @entity118 among the experienced names			1
and @entity120 will find more space , if he has pace around him			2
storming : @entity87 has had a superb season in which he made his @entity26 debut against @entity125 the stand - by players have to be ready too , because when did we last have a major tournament that was n’t interrupted by injury in the build - up ? so they have to stay sharp , focused and alert			1
my view on sports psychology is mixed , but @entity135 will also have a big role to play , especially with the @entity138 players			0
they were bouncing into the @entity7 , but now they are limping after what happened at the end of the season			0
nobody more so than the captain , @entity117			2
they will need some help to get ready for the challenges ahead			0
i hope this squad can deliver a surprise in @entity16			0
let ’s see how far they can go .			0

@entity12 must be patient behind @entity17
@entity107 must pick attacking players - @entity11 , @entity4 and @entity87
age profile of this squad *reminiscent* of @entity96 party
