by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 19:02 est , 16 july 2013 when a group of travellers chose their latest settlement , it seems they underestimated the quality of the opposition			2
they found themselves pitched against the hardy regulars of @entity10 , and from that point there was only going to be one winner			1
invoking ‘ the spirit of the @entity21 ’ , as the village cricketers themselves put it , and with a little help from @entity19 , they defended their turf throughout the night with a human barricade			2
cricket club chairman @entity52 , 50 , one of the first on the scene , said : ‘ this just is n’t the place for an invasion of travellers			1
it is a nice rural village and there were lots of people walking past who were horrified by what they saw			0
‘ we put the word out , used @entity19 to rally the local community and managed to barricade the entrance to stop any more caravans getting on and ruining our ground			1
’ players and staff from the local league champions side , including president @entity74 , 51 , set up a rota to stand guard for 24 hours			1
in that time , mr @entity52 claimed , the travellers left rubbish on the wicket and human waste on the outfield			2
one motorhome even parked on the square , lovingly tended by mr @entity52 ’s brother @entity84 , 40 , the groundsman			2
mr @entity52 said : ‘ @entity84 spends hours and hours on the ground when he ’s not working or playing for our second team			0
‘ that was our worst fear , so when they moved from the outfield to the square we went over to remonstrate and they just laughed in our faces			0
’ fighting back : @entity10 president @entity74 with the trailer which was used to block out the travellers fury : although the field has now been cleared , the club says the travellers damaged the cricket square and left rubbish and faeces police were called to the ground in the shadow of historic @entity107 , and stayed overnight to prevent an altercation			1
the travellers left just before midday yesterday			2
captain @entity109 , 30 , who manned the barricade until 7.15am before going to his job as a bank manager in @entity113 , said it was a ‘ victory for team spirit ’			0
he added : ‘ everyone at the club has other day jobs , but we got a rota going and all the lads have given up their time			2
‘ preparing one wicket for a game on saturday takes our groundsman five hours and for them to come on and wreck it is soul destroying			0
‘ when more of their convoy turned up in the night , the lads on the barricade blocked them out and turned them away			2
’ police were able to secure an eviction notice only after the club had to cancel a series of events			1
mr @entity52 said : ‘ the club had to cancel its under 11s and under 13s practice night , leaving 50 local youngsters disappointed , but this inadvertently resulted in the gypsies having to leave			1
‘ the police were able to serve an eviction notice because they are interfering with community events , otherwise their hands would have been tied			0
’ dispute : police were called in to prevent a ' breach of the peace ' as the stand off continued barricade : a local tradesman volunteered to park his lorry in front of the entrance to keep travellers out the stand - off began at 11am on monday when a local called mr @entity74 to warn him there were four vehicles on the outfield			1
mr @entity74 rang mr @entity52 ’s other brother @entity160 , 48 , a farmer and the club ’s opening batsman , who made a blockade with his car			0
they called in reinforcements in the form of a tradesman ’s lorry , and other players quickly arrived			1
mr @entity52 said : ‘ we heard there were dozens more caravans in the village asking for the postcode			0
‘ they were very aggressive and quoted every bylaw in the book to prove they were right			0
they were n’t open for discussion and told us they had every right to be there			0
‘ they threatened to stay for days			0
but we stood our ground and took turns to man the barricade			0
i do n’t think they realise how much volunteer effort goes into the club			0
’ victory : the club formed a barricade to prevent more travallers entering and they were eventually removed after the police and council were able to obtain a court order team effort : mr @entity52 said the players drew on the spirit of @entity204 's national team who are competing for the ashes against @entity207 this summer @entity208 said : ‘ we were called to @entity10 at 12.33pm on monday to reports of four caravans on the pitch			1
‘ members of the local community placed a vehicle across the entrance of the car park and prevented further entry			1
' that continued throughout the night and we remained at the scene to prevent a breach of the peace			1

alarm raised when caravans parked up on @entity10 's pitch
players and supporters from @entity31 club organised fight back
local tradesman blocks entrance with lorry to prevent more *incursions*
volunteers plug remaining gaps on 24 - hour shift basis through the night
police and council obtained a court order to have the travellers removed
