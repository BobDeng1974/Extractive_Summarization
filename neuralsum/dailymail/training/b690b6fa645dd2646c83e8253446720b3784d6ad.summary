as the great quiz show philosopher @entity1 once said , you ca n’t beat a bit of @entity3			2
back in the old days , that meant you might have ended up winning a caravan			0
something that would block your driveway , anyway			0
nowadays , if you ’re @entity10 , it means you have seen off all the competition ( and some disgusting bits of animal you ’ve eaten ) to become @entity14			1
now of course plenty of football fans know all about @entity10 as a much travelled and gifted player			1
and quite a few of them also know that a sadly injury - blighted career meant that his hereditary cheeky chapiness ( he ’s an @entity23 boy ! ) has made him a popular face on on football programmes			1
former @entity26 midfielder @entity10 reacts after being told he 'd be taking the next trial @entity10 had previously said that he would ' jump through the roof ' if he saw a spide or snake at home the retired footballer looked a little sheepish while having to put his hand into a wooden box but it is probably fair to say that to much of the audience tuning in on sunday evening for the first night of @entity38 ’s @entity36 , he is more like ‘ @entity10 who ? ’			1
which has n’t stopped many a vaguely familiar boy band member , or completely anonymous glamour model , making a bit of a name for themselves on the reality tv circuit , of course			0
but it ’s been over ten years since @entity49 wore the crown for the world of sport			0
so can @entity10 hit the bullseye this time around ? well , he certainly made an immediate impression when he made his entrance			1
@entity10 was meeting his team - mates at the hotel and nearly went down at the edge of the pool			1
the 36 - year - old was a lucky member ' @entity61 ' , who spent the first night in luxury his most famous celebration came in the form of a mock team - talk he gave his @entity67 team - mates in 2009 you can take the man out of football …			2
but he had nothing immediately to worry about as his half of the celebrity line up got an extra night of luxury , courtesy the great voting public			1
straight into the thick of things with his half of the contestants was sports other contender beneath the canopy , @entity84 ‘ i ’m @entity86 ’ @entity85			1
@entity86 seemed to have a less laid back approach to it all than @entity10 , as he began his jungle challenge			1
he told us in no uncertain terms that the three things he did n’t like were ‘ being hungry , being bored , and being with people ’			0
erm ? but @entity86 , it turns out , is made of sterner stuff than that			1
as @entity97 and @entity98 both pointed out , he was quite the ‘ boy scout ’ on the first night when he immediately got a fire going			2
@entity10 celebrates scoring from the penalty spot for @entity67 , against @entity101 at the @entity102 in 2010 @entity86 had to complete the @entity105 @entity104 trial as part of his first day in the jungle the former superbike champion was covered in snakes , but barely flinched during the challenge although i do n’t think you can get a badge for putting up with @entity116 ’s @entity115 ’s snoring ! and he was the first to take a @entity104 trial			1
‘ bring it on ’ he told the boys as he relaxed in a drain full of pythons			0
although perhaps the most nervous part was having one of them gently removed from his shorts by a lady after he successfully completed the challenge			2
quite frankly , nothing i have seen from him so far does n’t suggest that by about wednesday , he ’ll have fashioned a spear , tied on a headband , slapped on the camouflage make up and headed off into the trees to catch his own dinner			0
oh , and possibly garrotted @entity115			0
but is he going to be just too self - assured to win over the viewers ? 49 - year - old @entity137 looks as though he will take to life in the jungle quite easily @entity116 's @entity140 enjoyed a cold shower after a dramatic start to life in the jungle after a good night ’s kip , @entity10 checked out of the hotel , and into hell			1
that is , if you can call hanging around on a beach with @entity152 hell			0
while she then does all the hard work on the first challenge , with it ! yes , i suspect the only badges @entity10 has ever got are the ones on the front of his various football shirts			1
but @entity152 did n’t seem to mind @entity10 did , quite frankly , nothing			2
although the viewers were n’t quite so laid back , as he was given the first trial of day two			2
but will his efforts be enough to help him across the line ? there is , by the way , a third chance , sort of , for sport to triumph in the undergrowth			0
‘ @entity178 ’ @entity172 is a one time girlfriend of @entity174 and has yet to really make any real impact other than to have the pleasure of giving @entity115 a shower			0
but as the @entity180 girl pointed out , ‘ i ’m a celebrity ... ’ is all about ‘ the turtle and the slug			2
or horse and the rabbit ? ’			0
and you really ca n’t argue with that			0
@entity174 's former girlfriend @entity172 has n't managed to make an impact on the show just yet			0
