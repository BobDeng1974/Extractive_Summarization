by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent prolific : one in eight @entity2 now take statins , which cost 10p per day , but they may be over-used @entity2 is the statins capital of @entity5 with more than one in eight of us taking cholesterol - busting pills			1
doctors say rising obesity is behind the increase in prescriptions for the drug , which protects against heart attack and stroke			0
almost eight million now take statins , which cost just 10p per patient per day			2
but there are concerns that gps are dishing them out as the easiest solution rather than persuading patients to adopt a healthier lifestyle , which can also lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes			1
eight million @entity2 now take statins compared to five million a decade ago			1
our ranking as the top prescriber of anti-cholesterol drugs in @entity5 – and second across the developed world – is a wake - up call a day after millions of @entity2 recover from over-indulgence on christmas day			1
only @entity34 hands out higher levels of such drugs , according to the comparison of 23 industrialised countries by the @entity39			1
in @entity2 , family doctors can earn bonuses for tackling cholesterol problems , raising questions about their real incentive to prescribe the drug			1
one in five who take statins suffer side effects including muscle pain , memory disturbance , cataracts and diabetes			0
the @entity39 study confirmed that @entity2 is the fattest nation in @entity5 , with 24.8 per cent of adults classed as obese			1
@entity55 , from the @entity56 , said he feared gps were prescribing statins too readily because it was easier than changing a patient ’s habits			0
‘ lifestyle advice has always got to be the preferred route , and of course it is of no expense to the @entity66 , ’ he said			0
‘ there can also be side effects with statins			0
top of the poppers : the @entity2 is second only to @entity34 for the proportion of its citizens taking statin drugs ‘ but unfortunately now , because doctors are under so much pressure and because statins are known to be so successful , the simplest thing is to reach for the pad and write out a prescription			1
’ @entity81 , an economist from the @entity39 ’s health division , pointed to the fact that those at risk of heart attack and strokes are often flagged up earlier in the @entity2			1
‘ the @entity2 has quite high levels of obesity and is above average on alcohol consumption , ’ she said			2
‘ but unlike in @entity92 , where doctors simply do n’t ask about this type of thing , people with risk factors are detected earlier			0
‘ the question is though whether these people are given advice about improving their lifestyle , or are they put quickly on to statins ? ’ doctors used to prescribe statins only to those with a 30 per cent risk of a heart attack in the next ten years , but this was lowered to those with a 20 per cent risk in 2005			2
medical regulators are considering whether to go further and follow @entity113 guidance which suggests the drugs should be given if the risk is just 7.5 per cent			0
the drugs , pictured left , divide opinion			0
one in five people suffer side effects including muscle pain , cataracts and diabetes but some doctors say statins should be prescribed automatically to all people over the age of 50 some cardiologists have suggested statins should be automatically prescribed to all from the age of 50			0
but others are disturbed at the practice of dispensing the pills ever more widely			0
the @entity39 study says the use of cholesterol - lowering drugs , including statins , has more than tripled across member countries between 2000 and 2011			0
the @entity113 was not included in the research			0
highest levels of prescribing were in @entity34 , followed by the @entity2 and @entity140 , which both prescribe the drugs to 13 per cent of the population			1
the report , @entity144 , showed the @entity2 was among those with the highest consumption per capita in 2011 , over 40 per cent more than the @entity39 average			2
dr @entity148 , neuroscientist at the @entity149 , said the drugs were very effective at protecting against heart attack and stroke and estimated to save 7,000 lives in the @entity2 every year			1
but she said many @entity2 needed to make simple day - to - day changes , such as taking regular exercise , adopting a balanced diet and stopping smoking .			2

eight million of us now take the drugs compared to five million in 2003
@entity2 is second in the world statin rankings only to @entity34
concerns @entity164 may give them as ' easy option ' instead of improving lifestyle
