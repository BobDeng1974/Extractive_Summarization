how often you call your mother , what time you head to a bar or even how often you text your friends can all give clues to your mental and physical health			1
a new app hopes to harness this information to tell phone owners their mood - and even help them work with doctors to improve problem areas			1
called @entity15 , the app can track how often people messaged , how long they talk for , and how far they travel , as well as monitoring sleep and exercise			1
the first commercial products focus on depression , co-morbid depression , anxiety disorders , bipolar disorder , and schizophrenia			2
called @entity15 , the app can track how often people messaged , how long they talk for , and how far they travel , as well as monitoring sleep and exercise			1
it analyses messages and calls to work out how many people you have interacted with , and also asks users questions at key points through the day to work out how they feel			1
' we use your smartphone to map out your day , look at how you move around and how many other people you talk to , ' the firm says			1
' when something seems off , we send an alert to you and those who care about your health			2
' the first commercial products focus on depression , co-morbid depression , anxiety disorders , bipolar disorder , and schizophrenia			2
the firm works with doctors to give patients the app , and has partnered with @entity52 , @entity53 , and over 20 hospital systems and academic centres across the country			1
in addition , they are actively pursuing research partnerships , with universities to develop the app for long terms trials , including heart disease work with @entity63			1
' like providers , academic medicine is looking for better ways to understand how patient behaviors affect health outcomes , ' said dr. @entity69 , co-founder and ceo of @entity15			2
' @entity15 's smartphone app and analytics engine is essentially a new class of microscope that helps quantify and understand real - world behavior at scale , in many different disease areas			1
' for our academic partners , this offers new insight about clinical characterization , and it may lead to better diagnosis and new therapeutics and interventions for these conditions			2
' with those hospitals that already have patient outreach operations , @entity15 hopes to make these programs more efficient and proactive			2
the traditional method of outreach involves randomized check ins			0
co-founder and ceo @entity69 said often only about 20 % of patients who are experiencing symptoms get a call			1
' we use your smartphone to map out your day , look at how you move around and how many other people you talk to , ' the firm says			1
dr. @entity103 , @entity104 at @entity15 said : ' our partners are either deploying @entity15 's existing core behavioral health ( i.e. , mental health ) programs in new and exciting ways , or they are using the @entity15 platform on new conditions like heart disease and chronic pain			0
' ' we 're very excited about the approach @entity15 is taking to engage patients suffering from depression , ' said dr. @entity117 , professor of psychiatry at @entity63			0
' patient feedback on the experience has been overwhelmingly positive thus far , and we 're excited to learn more about what digital interventions can do for mental health			0
' researchers at @entity63 , are collaborating with @entity15 to help patients suffering from heart disease , multiple sclerosis and post-operative recovery			0
as part of the @entity131 , for example , @entity15 is helping world - class cardiologists detect early - warning signals for the development and exacerbation of heart disease			0
' heart disease is the no. 1 killer in the @entity140 and the developing world , and identifying heart disease risks and addressing them in advance is much needed , ' said dr. @entity144 , chief of the @entity145 of @entity146 and a principal investigator of the @entity131			1
' our ultimate goal through this study and others is to provide a thermometer or ' check engine ' light for people to be empowered in managing their own health and risk			0
' researchers at @entity159 also see the potential of @entity15 to help patients in postoperative recovery settings			0
patients undergoing joint replacement surgery use the @entity15 app to track their recovery , pain and return to functionality			1
drs. @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 of @entity173 , for example , recently shared their findings from a partnership with @entity15 in an early psychosis study			0
results announced at this year 's @entity178 showed the identification of specific ' smartphone signatures ' and patterns of behavior for symptoms of psychosis in adolescent populations			0
' this is n't science fiction , ' said dr. @entity103 of @entity15			0
' we 're touching a huge number of patients in a wide array of clinical settings			0
working alongside our partners , we 're having a real impact on population health management and improving patients ' lives â€” in some cases almost immediately			0
' ' this could be a turning point in the history of healthcare delivery , and that 's very exciting for us at @entity15			0
