10 of the youngsters live on the same street , while the other eight live nearby			0
what 's more , the estate 's baby boom looks set to continue into 2013 , with two more children due to be born to couples who moved in just two months ago			1
18 children have been born on one housing estate in @entity6 this year - which means a busy night for @entity2 @entity19 , 31 , gave birth to the estate 's newest arrival @entity23 just eight weeks @entity24 , who lives with husband @entity26 , 34 , a welder , and their three - year - old son @entity28 , said : ' it 's unbelievable			1
this @entity4 is going to be special because it 's @entity23 's first @entity4 so we are all very excited			1
' it 's great that we have all these children because they all get to grow up together , though they may have to extend the primary school in a few years			2
' @entity36 housing estate in @entity37 , @entity38 , welcomed 16 babies in the first half of this year , and two since july			2
child friendly : @entity43 in @entity6 's @entity44 is home to 10 of the new arrivals landlady : @entity48 ( left ) is known as ' @entity49 ' to the street 's new arrival , including tiny three - month old @entity52 , seen here with her mother @entity54 , 31			0
all are looking forward to the children 's first @entity4 housing bosses have had to have a special baby area allocated in the estate because of the unprecedented baby boom , which has seen the number of births soar to three times the national average			1
the sudden spurt in numbers also means @entity66 's population is now too big for the local primary school , which may give council bosses a headache in four years ' time			1
sales consultant @entity48 , known as ' @entity49 ' to the mums on the estate , said : ' with so many babies celebrating their first @entity4 this year , it seems sensible to do so as one joint party , otherwise it 'd be january before we got through them all			0
' i do n't know what it is about @entity36 , but it is a big hit with @entity82 of the new arrivals all live on the same road , within the collection of terraced houses			0
' we are already thinking about a joint street part next year when the children turn one , as it 's going to be difficult to keep up with all the first birthdays			2
' @entity91 , 30 , who lives with her eight month old daughter @entity92 , added : ' it 's incredible , it 's something else			0
' it certainly seems to be a unique situation , but a very pleasant one			0

two more children are expected in 2013 by couples living on the estate
the local council has had to create a special children 's area on the @entity66 estate because of the baby boom
