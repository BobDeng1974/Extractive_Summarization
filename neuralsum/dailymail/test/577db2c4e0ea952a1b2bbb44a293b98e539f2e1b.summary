white blood cells are the important infection - fighting part of the immune system , made in your bone marrow			2
patients with leukaemia produce an abnormal number of immature white blood cells which ' clog up ' their bone marrow			0
this stops bone marrow making other blood cells , which are vital for a balanced immune system and healthy blood			0
acute leukaemia comes on suddenly , progesses quickly and needs to be treated urgently			0
chronic leukaemia develops more slowly , over months or years			0
common treatments for leukaemia include chemotherapy , radiotherapy or a bone marrow transplant			0
it is predicted that 48 per cent of men and 44 per cent of women will survive the disease for ten years or more			0

she said : ' i was always popping down to my local corner shop for one craving or another but when i noticed @entity5 worked there i started going daily			2
' i knew the minimum spend on a debit card was five - pounds so i purposely never took cash so i could take longer choosing things in the shop that would equal over that amount			2
' me and @entity5 would always have a little chat and he worked every day he could but one day when i walked in i noticed a charity bucket on the till for him , it read ' help poorly @entity5			1
