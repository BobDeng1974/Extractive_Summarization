@entity1 owner @entity0 has warned he will stop ' throwing money ' at the club if he can not force through his controversial ' @entity1 ' rebrand			1
@entity0 has been bankrolling @entity1 since saving the club from financial calamity in 2010 , and has invested upwards of £ 70million in the team since then			1
he believes the only route to sustainability lies in changing the official name from @entity1 to @entity1 , a move he thinks would lead to sizeable overseas investment			1
@entity1 owner @entity0 ( left ) wants @entity1 to be renamed ' @entity1 ' to attract overseas investment despite the @entity14 throwing out his proposal in april , @entity0 backed manager @entity17 's rebuilding plans this summer with over £ 30million of transfer funds			1
but the 75 - year - old @entity19 , who is engaged in arbitration with the @entity22 over its decision and has also put the club up for sale , insists there will be no more spending unless he gets his way			1
' that [ the money ] stops now			2
it has to stop , ' @entity0 told @entity33 's @entity32			1
' i wo n't pay out if i can not create income			2
that is called ' throwing money at it '			0
' ' i wo n't throw money at a problem			0
i want to deal with the problem			0
' @entity0 's latest intervention can not have been welcomed by @entity17 , who has done his level best to play peacemaker in an increasingly bitter stand - off between the owner and sections of the fan base for over a year now			2
@entity1 have struggled on the pitch this season and have n't won in the @entity51 since the opening day that his words come on the eve of a home match against @entity55 , meanwhile , represents an unwelcome case of deja vu			1
it was the corresponding fixture last season when protests against the name change plan reached fever pitch , with supporter demonstrations proving an unwanted distraction as @entity1 slipped to their first home defeat			2
the atmosphere at the @entity67 has been on a knife edge at times this term , with chants of ' @entity71 we die ' now booed by rival elements of the crowd			0
@entity0 took over in 2010 and has since helped them get into the @entity51 and reach the @entity77 final what awaits in the stands on saturday , when @entity17 's main priority is a first win since the opening day of the season , is now an open question			1
but the manager was pragmatic when asked to comment on @entity0 's position ahead of the match			2
@entity17 noted that no further spending was now possible until january but insisted he would not be shy about requesting funds when the time comes			0
@entity1 manager @entity17 has had to act as a peacemaker between @entity0 and angry supporters ' the window 's finished and i 'm sure he ( @entity0 ) is delighted , but it 's my job to knock the door and want better and if i 'm not doing that i 'm not doing my job right , ' he said			1
' i will always , always ask the question			0
of course it 's not a bottomless pit , we understand that , and i have to say the chairman and the owners have assembled a wonderful squad together here			0
' we ca n't argue or grumble about what we 've been able to put together			0
so i wont be mithering him now but then the window does n't open for another three months			0
i 'll have a little nibble then			0
