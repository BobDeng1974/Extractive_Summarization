@entity10 recalls how she ‘ almost died ’ when she was attacked by convicted triple murderer @entity11 three years ago			1
but she says she could still be working in one of @entity14 ’s top security jails if ministers had offered routine stab vests sooner			1
victim : @entity18 guard @entity10 was left scarred for life after a horrific attack with a broken chilli sauce bottle by convicted killer @entity11 scarred : the broken bottle created a one inch hole in @entity23 ' back and chipped her spine a review is being carried out into giving frontline staff ‘ covert clothing ’ to protect from knife attacks launched by prisoners , @entity1 revealed this week			1
the number of prison assaults involving knives has doubled in a decade , with staff at risk of being deliberately attacked by inmates or getting caught up in fights			1
one morning in march 2013 @entity37 and fellow guard @entity38 unlocked @entity11 ’s cell door at @entity18 , a category a jail in @entity40			2
@entity11 , serving three life sentences for murdering three men with a machine gun over a £ 10,000 drug debt , lunged at @entity38 with a broken chilli sauce bottle , tearing open his upper left arm and severing an artery			1
‘ then he turned on me , ’ @entity37 remembers			2
‘ he used a broken chilli sauce bottle			0
it snapped in my back and it almost killed me			0
‘ had i had protective equipment i would n’t have suffered the injuries i suffered			0
it left me with a hole about an inch deep and it chipped my spine			0
‘ as a result i subsequently was medically retired , i have got @entity57			0
i have lost my career , ' she told @entity1			0
attack : @entity11 , serving three life sentences for murder , was cleared of the attempted murder of @entity10 and fellow guard @entity38			1
a campaign poster ( left ) against violence in jails featured a graphic picture of @entity68 's back after the attack @entity37 , who lives with her partner @entity70 and two daughters aged 18 and 15 , said the attack had a ‘ massive impact ’ on the entire family , including ‘ missing out ’ on the years when her children were studying for exams			2
‘ now i am on a cocktail of medication as well to assist with pain relief			2
i used to be physically fit and now i really struggle to do anything without suffering the consequences			0
’ the decision to issue prison guards with stab vests round the clock comes just two years after the government insisted it was not necessary			1
last year alone there were 246 assaults on staff and inmates in prisons in @entity92 and @entity93 involving a knife or blade , up from 127 in 2002			2
protective vests and gloves are usually only used when trouble breaks out in jails or if prison officers believe there is a serious threat to their own safety			2
but now prisons minister @entity104 has revealed that the @entity105 ( @entity105 ) which runs the country ’s jails is now ‘ assessing the benefits and feasibility ’ of issuing vests routinely			1
growing problem : there were 246 assaults on staff and inmates in prisons in @entity92 and @entity93 involving a knife or blade last year , up from 127 in 2002 @entity37 added : ‘ it is very humbling to see that the government has finally made the right decision to issue staff with the right equipment			1
‘ i am over the moon to be honest because i do n’t think members of the public actually realise what goes on inside those prison walls			0
‘ there is a need for protective equipment because the number of assaults is increasing			0
‘ we are dealing with some of the worst and most hardened criminals in the country			0
i think the prison service is kind of the forgotten service			1
‘ once you are in those walls nobody knows exactly what you deal with on a daily basis			0
’ after the attack on @entity68 and @entity38 , @entity11 was cleared of attempted murder by a jury at @entity148 crown court			1
he claimed he had been a victim of a culture of racism at the jail and launched the attack in self defence after years of abuse .			0
