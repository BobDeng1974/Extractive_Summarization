guiding @entity0 to a major championships would be as rewarding for @entity2 as winning the @entity3 with @entity4			1
that is the opinion of @entity6 , who won 15 caps for @entity0 in a team featuring the likes of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , yet never advanced to a world or @entity15 finals			2
@entity2 , who moved from @entity16 to @entity4 in an Â£ 86million deal in 2013 , helped real to ' @entity18 ' , their 10th @entity3 , last term and now has the chance to lead @entity0 to @entity21 and a first major tournament since the 1958 @entity23			1

' if @entity0 qualify , @entity2 will have a big say , and it will be up there with winning the @entity3 with @entity4 for him			1
' the relief in his reaction when we beat @entity46 was unbelievable			2
you 'd have thought he 'd won the @entity3 again			1
' @entity0 ' wait for a first tournament in almost 60 years - after a number of near - misses - could end after a strong start to the current campaign			0
' there are some big players that have missed out on playing in @entity58 and @entity59 , ' former @entity54 striker @entity6 added			0
' we came close in ' 94 with the game at the old @entity62 , where @entity63 ( @entity64 ) missed a penalty			0

we do n't want the play - offs this time			0
' i do think we 'll qualify automatically			0
with the start that we 've had , with the players that we 've got , with the confidence that 's flooding through the squad now			2
' we 've lost one in seven and that was against @entity92 when there was no ( @entity71 ) @entity71 , no @entity2 , no @entity94 , no @entity66			1
' we 've had a good start			0
seven points from our first three games , but we 've got three tough games coming up			0

the 47 - year - old said : ' @entity31 are the favourites			2
they 've got an unbelievable squad of players , but they 're beatable			0
' it would be one of the best results in @entity123 football history if we went there and got three points			0
