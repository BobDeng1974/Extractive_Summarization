click here for all the stats from the game using our fantastic match zone service @entity5 and @entity6 look money well spent for @entity8 but if @entity10 had splashed the cash on a central defender they would have beaten @entity13 at a canter on saturday			1
instead , @entity6 ’s injury - time goal was only good enough for a point as @entity13 took full advantage of a makeshift @entity19 defence to storm into a 2 - 1 lead after @entity5 ’s brilliant opener			1
going forward , @entity8 were breathtaking at times , @entity5 in particular			1
but without @entity23 ( @entity25 tendon ) , @entity26 ( ankle ) and @entity28 ( suspended ) , they were powder puff at the back			0
the defensive crisis meant left - back @entity68 filled in alongside @entity58 at centre - back , while rookie right - back @entity67 made his first league start for the club			0

‘ it was a disappointing afternoon			0
their second goal was our fault , we came out after half - time without the defensive concentration			0

despite their injury problems , @entity8 could have been three - up inside the opening 10 minutes , @entity71 , @entity6 and @entity74 all going close			1
the breakthrough came in the 13th minute and it was a touch of wizardry from @entity5 that unlocked the door , as his powerful shot beat @entity82 after he had skipped beyond @entity84			2
it should have been the signal for a saturday afternoon stroll but @entity56 then ripped though the heart of @entity8 ’s rearguard as @entity13 grabbed an unlikely leveller just four minutes later			1
picking up the ball in a similar spot to where @entity5 had started his run , @entity95 powered through before delicately chipping over goalkeeper @entity66			2
he was adamant @entity95 had pulled him back in the build up			0
looking at the replays , he was probably right , while @entity10 and @entity48 both said afterwards that @entity95 had fouled the midfielder			0
@entity5 opened the scoring at the @entity45 ... all was looking good for @entity8 at this point @entity5 fired home into the corner past the despairing @entity13 defence @entity10 and @entity48 bark out instructions during the game a the match finished 2 - 2 @entity71 had to be taken off after injuring his leg in a tackle with @entity90 @entity5 was instrumental in for @entity8 ... check out more stats using our fantastic match zone service @entity70 was a surprise substitute despite not taken part in full training after a hamstring problem former @entity8 captain @entity160 scored a fine goal for @entity162 against @entity163 the goal took the wind out of @entity8 ’s sails but the injury problems kept coming for @entity48 , as third - choice keeper @entity34 replaced @entity82 , who suffered a torn bicep in the 42nd minute			1
but those problems seemed a world away when @entity43 handed the visitors a shock lead quickly after the restart , as the @entity175 rose above @entity58 to head home @entity87 ’s cross			1
@entity10 ’s desperation was illustrated with 27 minutes left , as he brought on @entity70 — the man who scored the winner against @entity13 at @entity180 last season in the @entity183 final			2
prior to kick - off , @entity10 insisted @entity70 was not fit enough to be involved having only just recovered from a hamstring injury			0
but with his side needing a spark , @entity10 played his trump card			0
however , as the @entity19 welcomed one midfielder back , they lost another as @entity71 limped off with an ankle injury , though @entity10 confirmed he would be fit for wednesday ’s @entity193 clash against @entity194			0
the urgency in @entity8 ’s game grew with @entity70 ’s introduction			0
@entity74 was denied by some frantic last - ditch defending , before @entity85 stopped @entity5 with a heroic block in the 85th minute			1
it proved the former @entity202 defender ’s final contribution as he limped off with an ankle problem to add to @entity13 ’s injury woes			0
@entity34 then came to his side ’s rescue , tipping over @entity5 ’s header from @entity68 ’s cross but , in the first of six minutes of injury time , @entity8 snatched an equaliser			1
@entity5 was again at the centre of it , showing brilliant skill to beat three @entity13 defenders before playing in @entity6 , who excellently finished past @entity34			1
