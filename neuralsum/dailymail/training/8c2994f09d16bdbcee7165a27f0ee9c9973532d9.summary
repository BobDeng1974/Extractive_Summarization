sir @entity0 has spoken of his agony as he watched his son @entity2 being airlifted from the @entity3 during a charity hike after falling ill , unable to help him as he circled in a helicopter running low on fuel			1
the 29 - year - old was taken seriously ill with extreme altitude sickness as he neared the summit			1
he could n't breathe and was retching uncontrollably , so his guides radioed for him to be extracted by air			1
he did , however , manage to reach the top before he was flown to safety			1
he told @entity45 how he felt helpless watching from above			1
he said : ‘ i obviously did n't know that @entity2 was throwing up and had a horrendous headache that developed from altitude sickness			1
‘ i thought everything was going great			1
it was a beautiful day			1
we were circling the @entity3 and had one door open			1
he was advised not to get to the top but i can understand having got to close that he went for it			1
' i could see everyone huddling round somebody			2
he was retching and was in quite a bad way			1
' then , just as we were heading down , we saw an ambulance helicopter going up			2
we were short of fuel , so we landed			2
' then we heard that @entity2 had been medevaced off the top			2
they dangled him out of the door ! he said he opened his eyes and saw the mountain spinning below him , so he felt even sicker than he did before			2
he was clutching his guide			2
' they dropped him down to where we all were			2
he was shaken , but pleased that he 'd accomplished the top of the @entity3 , despite a slightly less than satisfactory end from his point of view			2
' he added : ' he was brought up watching me doing foolish things , whether it 's transatlantic sailing records or going round world in balloons			0
i ’m sure a bit of adventure bug has rubbed off on him			0
i ’m a great believer to see what you 're capable of and pushing yourself to the limits			0
' @entity2 told @entity45 that it involved a gigantic effort to reach the top			0
he said : ' one of the guides , mountaineer @entity85 , who ’s summited @entity87 11 times , told me 200 metres from the top that i ’d have to be choppered down			1
he said : “ if you dig deep we can get you to the top			0
” ‘ each step i would retch and cry			0
my team were being brilliant			0
they helped me push through the pain			0
’ agony : @entity2 described how near the summit he would take one step and retch , then another step and retch again expert help : @entity2 was guided to the top of the @entity3 by @entity85 , who has summited @entity87 11 times poorly : @entity2 kneels down in the snow on the @entity3 , unable to carry on @entity2 was then picked up by a helicopter , which took him away as he dangled from a winch while attached to a rescuer			1
he said : ' they have to get off mountain because the winds can be so unpredictable , so they fly straight off			0
i had my eyes closed ! i was in shock and not in the best way			0
i was emotionally drained and feeling sick			0
and the flight really freaked me out			0
’ he continued : ‘ it was an epic ending to an epic adventure and i ’m just glad everyone got down safely			0
’ the @entity3 is known in the climbing community as being a challenging peak			1
@entity2 added : ‘ there are sections where if you fall , you ’re dead			0
and it gets more technical the higher you get			0
’ hike : @entity16 before he was overcome with altitude sickness the ascent to the summit of the 14,700 - foot peak , which straddles the @entity38 - @entity37 border , was undertaken as part of the @entity28 high life : the @entity3 is known in the climbing community as being a challenging peak @entity28 participants are raising money for the @entity138 project , a charity set up by six friends including @entity16 , @entity141 and @entity142 , which gives youngsters in the @entity145 a chance to develop their non-academic skills			1
the challenge involved three back - to - back marathons from @entity150 to @entity151 , rowing across the @entity153 , cycling through @entity154 to @entity155 , hiking the @entity156 to @entity157 and climbing the forbidding @entity3			1
over £ 600,000 has been raised to date .			0
