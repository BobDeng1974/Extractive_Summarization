the 67 - year - old , talking ahead of the launch of @entity15 on @entity16 tonight , claimed some of the issues could be solved by ' having balls and standing up to @entity21 '			1
it is demoralising when you see stories about people who have lots of children who ca n't be bothered to work because they get more money from the system			1
that has to be sorted out			0
' and the fact that people from @entity43 can come here , particularly the old @entity45 countries that have joined the @entity46 - they see us like the land of milk and honey			2
' before you know it they are on benefits , national health and all that stuff			0
you can solve it by having balls and standing up to @entity21			1
' from november , @entity5 jobseekers will only be able to claim @entity57 and other key welfare benefits for a maximum period of 3 months			0

during the interview the former @entity81 boss - now in his tenth year fronting @entity15 - was critical of @entity83 leader @entity83 and said the current coalition was ' no good '			1
and he said it was ' fair to say ' that with the general election looming his @entity10 leader @entity86 was ' not the most popular of people as far as the country is concerned '			0
@entity0 ( pictured centre next to fellow @entity15 stars @entity91 and @entity92 ) said hard - working people found abuse of the benefits system ' demoralising ' and that it needed to be ' sorted out ' but he also backed the mp saying ' he can be prime minister '			1

the @entity10 declined to comment on @entity0 's remarks this morning			2
@entity101 's @entity100 spokesman @entity99 said : ' it is nice to see that even one of @entity10 ’s staunchest supporters , @entity103 lord @entity0 , has come to his senses and now recognises how the @entity3 ’s benefits system is being targeted by certain groups of @entity110 citizens allowed into our country under the " free movement of people " obligations of the single market			1
' in fact , it was successive @entity10 governments who opened the doors to mass unskilled migration into the @entity3			0
' it was @entity10 who opened the doors to peoples from @entity5 countries simply to garner votes in the institutions of the @entity110			0
' it is not the first time the businessman has sparked controversy			0
last week he stormed out of his own boardroom and accused a @entity136 reporter of ' gutter journalism ' after he was questioned about being a bully			0

earlier this year he called for the axe to fall on the @entity16 ’s ‘ layers of jobsworths ’			2
@entity0 boss @entity0 ( pictured ) is no stranger to controversy @entity15 boss said the @entity16 should axe the bureaucrats and managers who obsess with penny - pinching and instead focus on producing world - class programmes			1
