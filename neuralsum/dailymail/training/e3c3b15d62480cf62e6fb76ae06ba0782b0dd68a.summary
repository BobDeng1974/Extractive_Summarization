influential @entity0 have lined up to criticise @entity1 for letting checkout staff refuse to serve shoppers buying alcohol or pork			1
they described the workers ’ veto as ridiculous and said it was ‘ a policy that beggars belief ’			1
the incredulity among @entity12 observers came as @entity1 chiefs issued an apology over the affair , in which shoppers at a @entity18 store were told to find another till when they tried to buy wine from a @entity0 member of staff			1
' it 's ridiculous ' : legal consultant @entity25 criticised @entity1 after the chain allowed @entity0 employees to excuse themselves from serving alcohol or pork			1
the store has since apologised over the affair a spokesman for the @entity32 said yesterday : ‘ an employer can refuse @entity0 employees permission to be excused from serving alcohol or pork because it would impact on customer service , as has happened in this case			1
perhaps the solution should have been to deploy the @entity0 employee who objected to serve alcohol or pork on tasks away from the till			1
’ the rights of staff to observe their religious beliefs in the workplace have drawn legal and political controversy over the past few years			2
@entity47 workers who asked not to be made to conduct civil partnership ceremonies or to give sex advice to gay couples have been sacked , and judges have ruled that those who do not like their employer ’s rules should find another job			2
@entity1 store chiefs , however , told @entity0 checkout workers they were entitled to abide by their religious belief that they should not handle alcohol or pork			1
a spokesman for the chain insisted yesterday that its rules put customer service first , adding : ‘ we apologise that this policy was not followed in the case reported			2
’ @entity1 apologised after it emerged a @entity0 check - out worker refused to serve a customer alcohol an @entity1 spokeswoman said the store 's policy is that members of staff who can not handle specific food or drink products , as a result of their religious beliefs are given a ' suitable role ' @entity78 ( pictured ) said : ' i have never come across a @entity0			1
. who would refuse to serve a customer ' but the company found little sympathy among prominent moderate @entity0 leaders yesterday			1
@entity25 , a legal consultant who has advised the @entity85 , told @entity87 ’s today programme : ‘ i was quite dismayed when i heard this news about @entity1			0
i ’m just wondering how far till workers can go ? are they there to police what people are buying ? few interpreters of the @entity94 claim the holy text forbids any contact with pork or alcohol			1
rather , the guidance to the faithful is tolerant of those who break the rules out of necessity			0
among the passages that deal with food and drink , @entity107 two , verse 173 , reads : ‘ he has forbidden you carrion , blood , and the flesh of swine ; also any flesh that is consecrated other than in the name of @entity117			0
' but whoever is compelled through necessity , intending neither to sin nor to transgress , shall incur no guilt			0
@entity117 is forgiving and merciful			0
’ the same @entity107 , verse 219 , falls short of outright condemnation of drinking alcohol			2
it reads : ‘ they ask you about drinking and gambling			0
say , “ there is great harm in both , although they have some benefit for men ; but their harm is far greater than their benefit ”			0
’ there is no ban in the text of the @entity94 on selling alcohol			0
‘ will a till worker refuse to process a cake that has got champagne in it or a chocolate that has got brandy in it ? ‘ @entity0 can not eat any meat that is not halal , so will they refuse to process chicken or beef or lamb because it ’s not halal ? i do n’t know how far we are going to go			2
i think it ’s ridiculous			0
’ miss @entity25 said that @entity12 law does not prohibit muslims from selling alcohol in a supermarket			0
she added : ‘ i think that we have to live together and that includes @entity0			2
how are we going to live together if we are sitting in a shop saying , “ i wo n’t serve you and i wo n’t talk to you because you ’ve got this in your hands ? ”			0
’ @entity78 of @entity163 said : ‘ i have never come across a @entity0 in the retail trade who would refuse to serve a customer			1
if you are working in that trade , i do n’t think anyone will hold it against you if you are working at a checkout and passing through cans of drink or packages of pig meat			0
’ @entity1 has faced a series of threats from customers who said they would take their business elsewhere rather than be told to wait for another till			0
one shopper at the store involved said : ‘ i had one bottle of champagne and the lady , who was wearing a headscarf , was very apologetic but said she could not serve me			1
she told me to wait until another member of staff was available			2
’ the @entity1 statement said : ‘ customer service is our priority			0
‘ where we have an employee whose religious beliefs restrict food or drink they can handle , we work closely with our member of staff to place them in a suitable role , such as in our clothing department or bakery			1

@entity32 said situation should have been handled better
others said allowing workers not to serve alcohol or pork was ridiculous
customer was ' taken aback ' when the *female* member of staff explained she could not sell a bottle of @entity215 because she was @entity0
policy is to ensure staff who exercise the veto are given ' suitable roles '
spokeswoman apologised saying store had not followed ' internal policy '
