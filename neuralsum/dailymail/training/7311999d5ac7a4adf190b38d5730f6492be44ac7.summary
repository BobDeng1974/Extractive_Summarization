this year i will be hosting @entity2 lunch for ten people and , to make the occasion memorable , i have hit on a genius idea			1
instead of using boring old plates i shall serve the roast turkey on dustbin lids			2
this will be followed by plum pudding presented in a baseball glove , all washed down with fine wines sucked from a woolly sock			2
how does that sound to you ? ridiculous and totally unappealing , by any chance ? chips served in a plant pot - trendy or bizarre ? fortunately for my guests , i ’m only joking			1
but if i did go ahead i would only be following the latest pretentious restaurant - industry trend for dishing up meals on anything other than crockery			1
eating out can be something of a gamble anyway , but one thing you could be sure of until fairly recently was that your meal would arrive on a plate			2
if you dine at a trendy gourmet burger chain , a gastropub or an independent bistro , there is a high risk of your food being served on something else entirely			2
in the past couple of years i ’ve eaten steak from a roof tile , chicken off a brick , chips in a flower pot and rhubarb crumble and custard out of a dog bowl			1
i ’ve also sipped cocktails from jam jars and coffee from milk bottles , and used salt and pepper taken from egg cups , candle holders and ashtrays			2
the best was when i visited a friend in @entity58 and we ate at @entity61 @entity60 , where the bread was served in a flat cap , accompanied by butter slapped on a bit of old tree stump			2
seeing our faces , the maître d ’ assured us that the cap had never been on a head and the tree stumps were perfectly hygienic			0
he also admitted that , earlier in the day , an @entity73 tourist had threatened to walk out			0
i would n’t have gone that far , because the food was delicious and the staff were lovely			0
but i can see how picturing your bread and butter with a side order of dandruff and @entity82 disease could be an appetite - killer			0
it ’s a trend that shows no sign of abating , even though most people loathe it			1
so what ’s it all about ? food writer and author of @entity92 says : ‘ a lot of the time it ’s down to the insecurity of the chefs — and because they ’re not the ones trying to cut up meat on a slate or having their chips go cold because they ’re in a wire basket			1
in his books he often suggests plonking a saucepan in mid-table and letting guests feed from it like pigs at a trough			0
anyone who has been to a @entity107 ’s @entity117 will have sat there with the table groaning under all the planks , floor tiles , fish bowls , tin buckets and glass jars their food will come in or on			1
a delicious meal served up on a dustbin lid makes it less appealing says @entity127 and maybe @entity128 should take a share of the responsibility			0
it ’s thanks to him that so many restaurants now come with a ‘ concept ’ , when the only concept most diners require is to choose a meal and have someone cook it for them			1
yet @entity142 ’s @entity141 in @entity143 serves up its mixed grill on a garden shovel — and anybody who does n’t want to listen to seagulls cries , then eat their fish and chips out of a giant shell , is regarded as a philistine			1
once , i was presented with a burger on a mini-blackboard			0
the sauce was running everywhere , so i asked the waiter if i could have it on a plate instead			0
very snootily , he replied : ‘ i ’m sorry madam but chef is not working with plates at this current time			0
’ overseas it ’s even worse			1
there is an @entity167 restaurant in @entity58 where guests eat out of toilet bowls , and another where pizza is served on a hubcap			0
@entity142 ’s @entity141 in @entity143 serves up its mixed grill on a garden shovel then there is @entity175 , in @entity176 , @entity177 , which has three @entity179 stars			1
they like to dish up £ 100 - a - head grub on @entity182			0
back in @entity58 , what does the @entity183 @entity60 have to say ? ‘ it ’s a bit of fun , ’ manager @entity185 tells me			1
‘ we pride ourselves on serving locally sourced food and the flat cap is a cheeky nod to that			0
more people love it than hate it			0
’ at a time when many restaurants are struggling to survive , it ’s understandable that they want to find ways to stand out from the crowd			1
but surely the best way is to serve up tasty food at fair prices .			0
