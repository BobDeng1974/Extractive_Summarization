@entity0 , whose heart is too weak to pump blood around her body , is being kept alive by hi - tech equipment in her handbag a young woman whose heart is too weak to pump blood around her body is being kept alive thanks to hi - tech equipment in her handbag			1
@entity0 , from @entity10 in @entity11 , almost died when her heart began to fail			1
the 30 - year - old now relies on a battery - powered pump to operate her bionic heart and keep her alive			1
having to keep the device with her at all times means ms @entity0 carries the life - saving pack in her handbag			1
she will rely on the pump , which is known as a left ventricular assist device ( @entity23 ) until a donor heart becomes available , after suffering a series of cardiac arrests			1
‘ sometimes i find it tough carrying the @entity23 around with me all the time , ' she said			0
' it ’s quite weird knowing that it ’s thanks to something in my handbag that i ’m alive			2
‘ but i know how lucky i am - i ’ve been given such a great chance to live that not everyone has			0
‘ i would n’t get the opportunity to do all those little things in life that people love if it was n’t for my @entity23			0
’ she said that because the device is stashed away in her handbag , people fail to realise she has heart problems and it enables her to spend time with her husband , @entity47 , 29 , and family			1
in august 2013 , ms @entity0 underwent almost 4 hours of surgery to be fitted with the @entity23 at the @entity51 in @entity52			1
she also received treatment closer to home at the @entity55			0
‘ it ’s been a long road but now i get to live life normally , ’ she said			0
‘ the @entity23 is fitted internally - so there is a wire that goes from the external pack into my groin and travels up to my chest			2
‘ the external part are the batteries that keep the pump going - which is the part i carry in my bag			2
the 30 - year - old must keep the power pack for her bionic heart with her at all times , so she carries it around in her handbag ( pictured ) in august 2013 , ms @entity0 ( pictured ) underwent almost four hours of surgery to be fitted with her @entity23 at @entity51			1
' it 's been a long road to but now i get to live life normally , ' she said ‘ it weighs about two and a half kilos , so it ’s pretty tiring to carry it around all day			0
‘ i have to change the batteries every six hours so i always keep two spares too			0
‘ there is no limit to how long i can have it in - there are some people i know who have had an lvad for several years			0
‘ it ’s hard to live with sometimes but it certainly does the trick			0
i could have quite easily died last year , so i just feel so lucky that i ’m alive			0
’ ms @entity0 was fitted with her @entity23 after suffering a life - threatening cardiac arrest in july last year , having had problems for around six months			1
she first began to become unwell in december 2012 , when she suffered with a severe cough and chest pains			1
‘ i knew something was seriously wrong because i was just so ill all the time - i could hardly do basic day to day things , ’ she said			0
‘ eventually we went to hospital and on the way there i had a cardiac arrest			2
ms @entity0 ( pictured left ) said that because the device is stashed away in her handbag , people can not guess she has heart problems and it enables her to spend time with her husband , @entity108 , and her family ms @entity0 ’s surgeon , mr @entity110 , director of transplantation at the @entity112 and @entity113 , said : ‘ a ventricular assist device ( @entity115 ) is a mechanical blood pump that is used to support the function of a failing heart			1
‘ they are used in patients like @entity0 , whose only option is a heart transplant and this is known as a ‘ bridge to transplant ’			1
‘ the @entity115 enables patients to leave hospital and continue to live their life until a much - needed donor heart can be found			2
‘ many people are able to go to work , school or university and we even have patients who travel abroad with their @entity115			0
‘ unfortunately there is a severe shortage of donor organs and many patients are living with a @entity115 for several years before receiving a transplant			2
’ ‘ i was diagnosed with ventricular arrhythmia - an abnormal heart beat - and we were told that it was fairly easy to manage and i would be fine - i was given an @entity143 [ a type of pacemaker ] and we thought that would be the end of it			1
‘ but the symptoms came back and that ’s when i was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy … which meant my heart was too weak to pump the blood around my body			1
‘ i was told my only option was a heart transplant and was transferred to @entity51			2
‘ it was just so unexpected and overwhelming - i ’ve never heard of anyone having a transplant before			0
’ ms @entity0 ’s heart was only functioning at 10 per cent and after three months in hospital she had a cardiac arrest			1
‘ doctors told @entity108 that i had a very low chance of survival and he should call my family as it was unlikely i would make it , ’ she said			0
‘ i was rushed to theatre because the @entity143 had n’t kicked in and my heart function was below one per cent			0
ms @entity0 's problems began six months before she was fitted with the @entity23			1
she was given a pacemaker but was later diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and had a cardiac arrest			1
doctors told her husband @entity108 ( pictured with ms @entity0 ) she had a ' very low chance of survival ' ‘ i was in theatre for almost 10 hours and came out the next morning on @entity182 – a type of life support			1
‘ it was really touch - and - go but luckily i managed to come around nine days later			0
' after she woke up from the operation , ms @entity0 was told by her cardiac surgeon that she would be given an @entity23			1
‘ @entity108 and i had seen some other patients with them , and the nurses had told us about them , so we knew how incredible they were - we could n’t believe that i might actually be given one			0
it was fantastic , ’ she said			0
mr @entity47 said : ‘ when @entity0 had her cardiac arrest i was told that she probably would n’t make it out of theatre			1
‘ i had to wait in a little room whilst she was in surgery for almost ten hours			0
i can remember that room perfectly - it was a horrible time			0
‘ but luckily , she made a wonderful recovery and she ’s doing so well now			0
’ ms @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s [ @entity23 ] given me my life back and i could n’t be happier			2
‘ i want to say a big thank you to everyone in @entity51 and @entity210 , especially my cardiologist @entity211 , my cardiac surgeon - or superman – mr @entity110 , and the transplant and @entity115 teams			2
without them , i would n’t be here			0
’ ' the @entity23 is fitted internally - so there is a wire that goes from the external pack into my groin and travels up to my chest			2

@entity0 , from @entity10 , @entity11 has a bionic heart and relies on a battery - powered pump to keep her alive
the ventricular assist device ( @entity115 ) - necessary until she gets a heart transplant - *includes* a large battery pack , which she carries in her handbag
she was fitted with the device after suffering a life threatening cardiac arrest in july last year , having had heart problems for around six months
the 30 - year - old first fell ill in december 2012 , when she suffered a severe cough and chest pains
after her first cardiac arrest she was diagnosed with an abnormal heart beat and fitted with a pacemaker
the problems *persisted* and she was told she had dilated cardiomyopathy
she had another heart attack before being fitted with a @entity115
ms @entity0 , who had another heart attack before being fitted with a @entity115 , said the device has given her a new lease of life
