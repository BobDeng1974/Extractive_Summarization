a police source told the newspaper : ‘ it is inconceivable there was an eight - year gap between the murder of @entity42 and @entity43 with no further crimes … had he not been arrested for @entity43 ’s murder , he would have gone on to attack more women			0
’ the source said police are looking at a ‘ potential offending period of more than 30 years ’ since his teens and they believe he was ‘ very forensically aware ’			1
it has also emerged that @entity3 , 48 , of @entity4 , allegedly once asked a fellow inmate : ‘ how many do you need to be a serial killer ? ’			1
he is said to have asked the question about serial killers aged 20 while in prison after being jailed for four years in 1984 for raiding upmarket country homes for antiques			1
his cellmate replied : ‘ at least three ’ , before he reportedly asked the prisoner : ‘ have you ever thought of strangling your girlfriend during sex ? ’ the chilling conversation between the inmates is said to have emerged when police officers were investigating @entity3 over the two murders			1
both dead : @entity3 has been jailed for at least 25 years for the murder of @entity15 ( left ) but a second charge over the death of @entity16 ( right ) was withdrawn due to a breach of police protocol it comes following revelations from @entity3 ’s ex-lover @entity75 that they had sex just hours after he murdered miss @entity20			1
she was unaware when she got into bed with him that he had abducted and stabbed the woman - and claimed he was ‘ laughing and joking ’			0
bare - chested : @entity3 seemed ' completely normal ' the day after the attack , according to his then - girlfriend @entity75 the ex-lover also told the @entity82 that he texted her to say he loved her shortly before he carried out his brutal attack on @entity20			0
the office worker was making her way back to the home she shared with her boyfriend after leaving @entity4 's @entity89 nightclub when she got into @entity3 's green @entity91 taxi			1
instead of taking her home , the killer drove @entity20 to nearby @entity94 where he sexually assaulted and killed her			0
the cab driver also moved miss @entity20 's body to a location in @entity98 , @entity99			0
he eventually led police to her remains following his arrest later in the month of march in 2011			2
@entity3 's ex-wife @entity103 , a nurse , said the killer collected his teenage son in his taxi the day after his attack on @entity20			1
she said he sent a grovelling letter to his family for forgiveness			0
it has also emerged that @entity3 could now face questioning over a string of unsolved killings			2
sentencing him last week to at least 25 years for @entity20 's murder , mrs justice @entity114 said he abused his position as a taxi driver - and the woman would have suffered ' extreme fear '			1
@entity3 escaped justice over the charge related to miss @entity16 ’s death after a judge ruled his legal rights had been breached by detectives during the course of their investigations			1
@entity3 has been urged by his daughter to give the family of a second woman he killed ' justice ' over her murder			2
@entity132 said her father , who is beginning a life sentence for the murder of nightclubber @entity136 , should ' do the right thing ' and ' tell the truth ' over the murder of missing prostitute @entity16			0
' he needs to give the other family closure as well and give them the justice they need for their daughter , ' she told @entity144			0
ms @entity132 said she had received letters from her father but she has not replied to them			0
she said he had urged her to change her name a number of times			0
' we have had quite a few letters that have said ‘ sorry for putting you all through this ’ and things like this , ' she said			0
she added : ' as much as i want to hate him , i ca n’t			0
@entity157 pity him and i do feel sorry for him and i hate what he has done but i ca n’t hate him			0
' investigation : police search woods near @entity98 , @entity99 , where @entity15 's body was found the suspension of the senior detective who persuaded @entity3 to lead him to his victims ’ bodies is worrying , his supporters say			1
detective superintendent @entity168 was suspended on full pay three weeks ago and is being probed by the @entity170 over a blunder during the case			0
despite the detective persuading @entity3 to lead him to the graves of two victims , he failed to read him his rights - which meant the killer 's confession of murdering miss @entity179 was inadmissible in court			2
but former @entity182 detective chief inspector @entity181 told the @entity183 that @entity184 made reasonable judgments ' in a dynamic and fast moving situation ’			0
and @entity188 chair @entity187 ( pictured ) said the case could prompt a reform of the @entity191 , as policing has ‘ changed enormously ’ in 28 years			2
