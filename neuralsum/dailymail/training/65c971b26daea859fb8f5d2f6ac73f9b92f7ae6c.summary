a disgruntled woman is selling her ex-husband 's @entity1 for a measly $ 20,000 as payback for him cheating on her so she can have her own fun with men on a @entity9 jaunt			1
the jilted woman from @entity11 , in @entity13 's northeast , placed an advertisement titled - @entity20 precious @entity15 - on the @entity17 website with the justification behind her vindictive plan			1
' i have been married to this unfaithful poor excuse for a human being for over 25 years and yes we are wealthy , ' she firstly pointed out about the 2010 @entity26 model that is worth about $ 150,000			1
woman advertises the sale of her ex-husband 's 2010 @entity15 997 for $ 20,000 for being unfaithful the daring woman then went onto explain how she discovered her man , that she had committed to for quarter of a century , was doing the dirty			1
' i had hunches that my husband was cheating so i followed him out on what he said was a ' guys poker night ' to find him at a 5 star restaurant cuddling up to this young blonde woman ( clich√© ) , ' the ad says			1
' so to pay him back , as i have rightful ownership of his precious @entity1 , i have decided to sell it for a specific price of $ 20,000			1
' and she ends the post with the clincher on how she plans to spend the money			2
' i figured $ 20,000 is just enough for a return flight / accommodation to @entity9 so i can fondle with all the wealthy @entity9 men ! ' the jilted ex-wife plans to spend the money on a @entity9 holiday to ' fondle ' all of the wealthy @entity9 men the advertisement naturally caused some colourful responses from interested buyers of both the sports car and its female owner			1
' it 's a bit of a ride from the east coast of the @entity64 , but if your offer is legit , i 'll be happy to make the trip , respect and pay your $ 20k asking price , and take you to dinner , ' @entity60 posted			1
' ill [ sic ] come pick it up now and ill take you too if you want but seriously ill come buy it now , ' @entity71 said			2
the lucky woman already has a place to stay in @entity76 on her @entity9 trip ' i 'm happy to give you $ 20000 in cash and a free accommodation in @entity82 , @entity78 offered			1

' i am not rich but also went through the exact same thing with my first husband who was cheating on me with any woman that would give him the time of day , ' @entity105 posted			1
' what i can never figure out is why these men get married to be in a committed relationship if they do not plan on staying committed			0
' i applaud you for hitting him where it hurts the most , which is his wallet ! i wish you all the best , and the sooner you get away from this two timer , the better your life will be ! ! ! ! ! : ) ' the ad attracted some responses by people asking out the woman while others empathised with her situation while there were others who doubted the post was a legitimate advertisement			1
' more like a bogus ad to draw crowds to this site			2
try finding another @entity1 or @entity129 or anything on here lol why would n't this be on carsales and why does n't it have @entity135 's or a rego plate ? surely with the unbelievable low k 's it should still have number plates , ' one person questioned			2
