it was intended to damage his reputation			0
' we subsequently learned he had received death threats			1
' his brother @entity67 - who said mr @entity11 was a very likeable person - added : ' it transpires that the person who was behind the smear campaign was a rival bidder to buy the @entity50			1

why would he think somebody would knock him off for putting through a legitimate business deal with legitimate business partners ?

no - one should die in this way			0
' it had to be someone or some others , for whatever reason , and that is the purpose of other courts , a criminal court , to deal with			0
