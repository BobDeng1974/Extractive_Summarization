by @entity0 published : 12:23 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 13:50 est , 5 february 2013 @entity1 was barely a day old when doctors told her parents she would need major heart surgery if she was to survive past three months			1
she had four operations during which her heart stopped beating for three minutes and she suffered a collapsed lung			1
but she fought back each time and now 16 months on her parents say she is a ' bundle of energy			1
' @entity1 's transformation was partly thanks to a pioneering procedure during which surgeons replaced a faulty artery in her heart with a cow ’s jugular vein			1
@entity17 ... bundle of joy : @entity1 with her parents @entity20 and @entity22			1
the 16 - month - old has undergone four heart operations already her parent 's @entity20 and @entity22 , who live in @entity25 , were full of praise for their plucky daughter			1
‘ @entity1 is amazing , ’ mrs @entity1 , 32 , said			2
‘ she bounces back so quickly			0
she ’s never been in hospital more than ten days after surgery			0
' you ’re always conscious , if she gets a cold or seems a bit off , that it could be something to do with her heart – but she is such a bundle of energy and we have to stay positive			2
’ the couple ’s ordeal began the day after @entity1 was born at @entity42 on september 20 , 2011 , when tests revealed she had a heart murmur			1
they found out she had a condition called truncus arteriosus , which affects fewer than one in 10,000 babies			0
instead of two arteries leaving the left and right sides of the heart , @entity1 had a single , large one – sending too much blood to the lungs			1
in october 2011 she had a cow 's jugular vein fitted at @entity56 in @entity57 , but the surgery ran into complications			0
little fighter : doctors had to re-wire her heart using a cow 's vein when she was just four weeks old @entity65 is fed via a drip by her mother @entity20 , following her first open heart surgery ‘ we were devastated , ’ mrs @entity1 recalled			2
‘ we just cried and cried			0
during her first keyhole surgery her heart stopped for three minutes			1
they could n’t get it restarted so they had to give her adrenaline and shock her			0
' @entity75 run : @entity1 's father plans to run 2,013km , which is equivalent to 48 marathons in 2013 in february 2012 @entity1 went back in to have a stent fitted to reduce the pressure on her heart , but impressed her parents with her fighting spirit			1
‘ @entity1 never lets anything keep her down , ' her mother said			2
' after the second operation , she was taken to intensive care but the first night she ripped out all her lines , took herself off the ventilator and wanted to eat yoghurt			0
’ @entity1 also suffered a collapsed lung but again she pulled through and was out of hospital within seven days			1
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ she likes to keep us on our toes			2
’ a second open heart operation came in august 2012 and in october she had three further stents put in			0
now mr @entity97 , 35 , has pledged to run 2,013km in 2013 to raise £ 10,000 – to be matched by his employer @entity98 – for the children 's hospital that has saved @entity1 's life so many times			1
so far , he has signed up to eight marathons , half marathons and 10ks around the country to help him hit the target			0
since january 1st he has managed to run 188km ( 117miles ) - the equivalent of four and a half maratons			2
‘ to look at her , you would n’t think she has gone through all that she has , the way she dances and runs around the house , ’ he said			0
‘ all you can say to the doctors and nurses is thank you , but it never feels enough			0
