by @entity0 @entity1 , now 64 , was just 17 when , on @entity2 1967 , she gave birth to her much - loved baby daughter @entity4			1
but as an unmarried mother at a time when single parenthood was frowned upon , she had just six weeks with her child before she was taken away from her forever			1
now , almost half a century on , @entity1 says she has never been able to have other children because she ' did n't deserve to '			1
' i do n’t deserve children			1
i gave one away , how could i ? i just gave her away without a fight			2
' i do n’t see myself as a mother now , i ca n’t see myself as a mother , ' she continues			2
' i have n’t had that real opportunity of bringing a child up all through the trials and tribulations that kids go through			1
i have n’t done it			2
' @entity1 , who now lives in @entity27 , was born and brought up in a south @entity29 semi , where she lived with her mother , father , two brothers and grandmother			1
' my life now is a world away from where i grew up , ' she explains			2
' we lived in a three up two down in south @entity29 and there was my mum and my dad , myself , my two brothers and my nan in the front room , which meant we only had the back room for the five of us			2
it was tight , it was tight			2
' tragic : like @entity47 , whose life was turned into a film , @entity1 never gave up hope of finding @entity11 sad : although the real @entity47 's search ended sadly , @entity1 got a happy ending aged 15 , she left school and got a job as a receptionist			1
but it was n't long before she found herself caught up in a relationship with an older married man			0
' i was bowled over by him , ' she remembers			0
' i felt like a silly schoolgirl			1
the whole situation took us both by surprise , i think			0
i fell completely in love with him			0
' but within a year of striking up the relationship , @entity1 discovered that she was pregnant			1
' i was 17 and i was frightened , ' she says			1
' my boyfriend was married so i could n't turn to him			0
i could n't ask him for help			0
i thought , " this ca n't be happening , it ca n't be true "			0
' when the time came and i could n't hide it any longer , i had to finally face my parents			0
i told them and i had no idea what was going to happen			0
but mum and dad , they took charge			0
' she broke up with her boyfriend and gave up her job , while her parents found a mother and baby home for her to go to			0
on @entity2 1967 , she gave birth to her baby daughter , @entity4			1
' it was amazing when i first held her , ' remembers @entity1			1
' i thought , " wow ! i , me , have had a baby			0
i just need to look after this child now			1
it did n't dawn on me that that child would be taken away from me			2
' unbeknown to @entity1 , her parents had made arrangements to have the baby given up for adoption and when the time came , she felt she had no alternative but to go along with their plans			1
' a lady came in from the side and she said i 'm going to take your child now , ' she remembers			2
' and she picked her up and i said : " are you going to keep her name ? " ' coldly , the woman replied : ' i ca n't tell you that			0
' and with that , @entity1 's baby was gone			1
' the double doors opened and she was gone , ' says @entity1			1
' that 's when it dawns on you , she has gone			0
' i do n't know how i could have done it , how i could have gone along with it , ' she adds			0
' i should have said , " @entity124 , come on			0
we can make this work , other people do it , why ca n't we ? " but i never did , i never said it			0
' 10 years later , @entity1 met and married her husband @entity130 and moved to @entity27 , but the couple never had children of their own			1
notorious : mother and baby homes such as this one in @entity136 were once to be found all over the country ' @entity130 and i found each other and before we got engaged , we said we did n't want children			2
i felt that it would be slightly disrespectful to @entity4			2
' how could i have a child and give her away ? how could i have done it ? ' but things are finally looking up for @entity1 after she was reunited with her daughter with the help of @entity148 documentary , @entity147			1
@entity4 , who much to @entity1 's delight is still called @entity150 , lives in @entity151 with her 13 - year - old daughter and says that she believes her mother did the right thing			1
' i 've always known [ i was adopted ] , ' she says			0
' i can not remember a time when i was sat down and told			0
the right thing happened for me and it all worked out well			2
' ' i knew immediately it was her , ' said a delighted @entity1 immediately after their reunion			1
' her eyes lit up when she saw me and she held out her arms to me and that was the best hug ever			0
' i just want to be a little part in her life , just a little bit in the background , ' she continued			0
' it 's time we go forward now			0
' @entity1 and @entity4 appear on @entity169 , tonight at 9pm on @entity148			1
