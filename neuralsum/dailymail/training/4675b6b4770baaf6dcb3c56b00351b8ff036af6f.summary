there are few things in life that are more irritating			2
you are mid-conversation with a friend and they check their phone and begin replying to a text or checking their emails			2
but now , people everywhere are beginning to lose patience with the phenomenon known as phubbing : snubbing others in a social setting by checking your phone			2
@entity17 is the act of snubbing someone during a social interaction to look at your mobile - and now a campaign has begun to stamp it out ( file photo ) a @entity17 campaign group has started in @entity27 and at least five others have sprung up in its wake as outrage about the lack of manners grows			1
the campaign 's creator , @entity33 , 23 , from @entity35 , said : ' a group of friends and i were chatting when someone raised how annoying being ignored by people on mobiles was			2
' he has created a website where companies can download posters to discourage phubbing and even placecards for weddings			0
@entity17 is just one symptom of our increasing reliance on mobile phones and the internet which is replacing normal social interaction			1
research reveals that 44 per cent of us spend more than half an hour a day looking at our phones , eight per cent admit to checking it for three hours a day and three per cent say they spend five or more hours on their mobiles			0
a third of @entity59 polled admitted to being phubbers and more than a quarter ( 27 per cent ) said they would answer their phone in the middle of a face - to - face conversation			1
posters can be downloaded from the @entity17 website for businesses to help combat bad manners the survey also found that 57 per cent of @entity59 check their emails on holiday , compared to 32 per cent who did n't and 11 per cent who were n't sure			1
a third confessed that they would answer the phone in a restaurant and 19 per cent said they would while being served in a shop			0
the @entity79 research comes after a supermarket checkout assistant in south @entity81 refused to serve a woman until she stopped using her phone			1
the poll , for a sunday paper , also found that 54 per cent of people checked @entity87 , @entity88 or other social media every day , with 16 per cent checking more than ten times a day			0
an unsurprising 63 per cent of people carry their phone with them ' almost all , or all of the time ' , it found			0
according to research by advertising agency @entity96 , 37 per cent of people feel it is worse to not answer a message than it is to ' phub ' your friends			0
@entity103 , a professor of psychology at @entity105 who has studied internet addiction disorder , said many phubbers show symptoms of addiction to their mobile phone			1
they also show withdrawal signs if they are not allowed to use their phones constantly , he said , adding that he does not own a mobile phone			0
a third of @entity59 admit to being phubbers while more than a quarter said they would answer the phone mid-conversation ( file photo ) he said : ' the internet and social media are good things up to a point but we have to control them			1
if you were talking to someone and someone else came up and you started talking to the other person without including the first person in your conversation that would be thought of as very rude			2
' professor @entity103 , who does not own a mobile phone , said : ' we call it social connection ; but it 's not			0
' many do not realise they are phubbing and are unconscious of the irritation they cause			0
@entity141 , regional director of @entity96 's @entity143 unit which carried out the research , said : ' people do not appreciate the influence mobiles have had on their lives			0
' when it comes to inappropriate or rude behaviour , there 's not as much admission to conducting those behaviours in the @entity59 as there are in other markets			1
' only about 20 per cent of @entity59 people admit to phubbing , lower than in the @entity156 '			1

a third of @entity59 polled by @entity79 have admitted to being phubbers
