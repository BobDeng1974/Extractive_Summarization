by @entity0 health bosses have seen their pay soar by 13 per cent in just four years - even though patients are being denied treatment because there is not enough cash			0
@entity8 figures published today that senior managers now earn an average of £ 76,000 a year , up from £ 66,000 in 2009/10			1
the pay - rises have been handed out despite a supposed pay - freeze across the public sector - and at a time when the @entity8 is meant to be saving billions of pounds to become more efficient			2
new figures have revealed doctors are enjoying pay rises while nurses and midwives salaries fall behind inflation experts say they have come about thanks to a lucrative scheme within the @entity8 whereby the majority of staff are automatically given a rise every year just for showing up for work			1
critics are calling for the system to be abolished and say crucial health service cash is being diverted away from treatment into the already ‘ bloated ’ salaries of bureaucrats			0
although the @entity8 budget has been ring - fenced from public sector cuts , hospitals and other organisations have been collectively ordered to make £ 20 billion of savings by next year			2
officials want the money to be ploughed into improved care for the aging population and more advanced , but expensive , treatments for cancer and other life - threatening illnesses			0
but faced with such strict targets , many @entity8 trusts have been rationing certain non-emergency treatments including hip and knee replacements , cataract surgery and hernia operations			0
bosses have also been slashing front - line staff and separate figures show that almost 5,000 nursing posts have been lost across the health service over the past three years			0
@entity60 , chief executive of the @entity61 ’ @entity62 said : ‘ the health budget should be spent on patient care , not pay hikes for the already bloated @entity8 bureaucracy			2
‘ the public sector is meant to have faced a pay freeze but clearly this has n’t been the case for @entity8 senior managers			1
‘ huge sums of taxpayers ’ money have been pumped into the @entity8 , but far too much of this has been wasted on pay increases rather than on treatment and facilities			2
’ the figures reveal the average salaries for all @entity8 staff have risen by 8.6 per cent since 2009/10			1
but doctors ’ pay only went up by 2.2 per cent over this period compared to the 7.5 per cent rise seen in that of nurses and midwives			0
dr @entity87 , general secretary of the @entity88 said the figures send ' the wrong message ' about the contribution of front line @entity8 staff over the last 12 months the pay for senior managers - who include chief executives and heads of department - increased by three times the rate of nurses			1
while nurses ’ average salaries only increased by 0.6 per cent since 2011/12 , senior managers ’ went up by 2.2 per cent			1
dr @entity87 , general secretary of the @entity88 said : ‘ frontline health care staff work exceptionally hard in difficult circumstances to care for patients with limited resources , and these figures will send completely the wrong message about how much their contribution is valued			0
‘ it is not too much to ask that nurses and other front - line staff who do so much to keep the @entity8 afloat in increasingly difficult circumstances are treated the same as their management colleagues			0
” ‘ we are hearing time and again from nurses who are struggling to keep their heads above water financially as their pay falls far behind inflation , and finding out that already well paid senior staff are enjoying these pay rises will be extremely demoralising			1
experts say that about 55 per cent of all @entity8 staff enjoy an automatic or ‘ incremental ’ pay - rise every year just for turning up			1
@entity8 employers - the body in charge of negotiating salaries - has repeatedly called for contracts to be changed warning they are costing the health service an extra £ 500 million a year			2
a spokesman for @entity133 said : ‘ the @entity8 employs over a million people with a range of different skills			0
the vast majority , including managers , are on incremental scales that rise each year			0
‘ the figures reflect that while there was a pay freeze in the @entity8 in 2012/13 so that headline pay did not increase , almost two thirds of all @entity8 staff on national pay scales would have received incremental pay progression within their salary band			1
’ @entity149 seized on the figures as proof that the @entity152 could not be trusted with the @entity8			1
@entity153 mp , the party ’s shadow health minister , said : ‘ @entity155 is giving @entity8 managers cushy pay rises and pay - offs , whilst nurses get pay freezes or @entity161			1
‘ he stands up for the wrong people and proves you ca n’t trust the @entity152 with the @entity8			2
’ earlier this week mps from the health select committee called for hospitals to publish figures on the numbers of nurses working each night amid concerns of staffing shortages			0
and research by @entity173 published this week found that 43 per cent of @entity8 wards have too few nurses .			0

senior managers now earn an average of £ 76,000 a year
experts blame lucrative @entity8 scheme which awards pay rises every year to staff ' for turning up '
