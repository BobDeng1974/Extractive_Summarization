it was a disappointing night for the @entity3 ’s @entity2 stars , as both @entity4 and @entity5 were subbed off in a 0 - 0 draw against @entity7			1
@entity3 captain @entity4 seemed to damage his hamstring in the 15th minute , and despite attempting to continue , he was stretchered off six minutes later			1
@entity5 , so superb in a man of the match display on sunday against @entity10 , was practically anonymous			1
@entity3 defender @entity11 ( left ) challenges @entity7 's @entity12 ( right ) @entity7 : @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , @entity23 ( @entity24 , 73 ) , @entity12 ( @entity25 , 79 )			2
@entity3 : @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity11 , @entity30 , @entity32 ( @entity31 , 23 ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 , 86 ) , @entity35 , @entity5 ( @entity36 , 63 ) , @entity37			1
having been unlucky to only pick up a point in their first game , the @entity3 side were surprisingly off the pace against the competition ’s smallest country , failing to get their dangerous attacking players into the game			1
@entity5 briefly burst to life in stoppage time at the end of the first half , running at the @entity7 defence before driving a shot from the edge of the box which was saved , relatively comfortably , by @entity13			1
it was his only meaningful contribution in a thoroughly disappointing performance , which was cut short soon after when the winger replaced after an hour			0
the result leaves both sides knowing a win in their final game will guarantee progress to the knockout stages , but anything less could see them crash out			1
@entity7 defender @entity16 ( right ) tries to win the ball from @entity11 ( left ) the @entity66 were indebted to their keeper @entity26 to even get away with a point			0
the 38 - year - old made a superb double save five minutes from time following a corner , and another stunning stop two minutes later to deny substitute @entity73			2
the closest @entity3 came to a goal was when the @entity76 ’ centre back @entity17 almost beat his own keeper with a back - header , but @entity13 reacted just in time to stop the ball going over the line			0
@entity7 , on the other hand , appeared to have taken confidence from holding @entity84 in their opener , and showed the greater invention			2
@entity88 forward @entity21 was a particular threat , using his pace to get in behind the @entity66 defence several times			0
on one such occasion the speedster should really have scored , but having beaten the offside trap he took far too many touches before getting his shot away , and eventually wasted the chance			0
the @entity3 team pose for a team photo before the match @entity7 's side pictured together before their second group b match , which ended 0 - 0 the @entity76 were , as ever , most dangerous from set pieces , and they should have gone ahead from one on the half - hour mark			0
a dangerous ball in from the left hand side found @entity107 , attacking the ball uncontested from seven yards , but he headed straight at @entity109 in the @entity3 goal			0
centre back @entity15 and striker @entity12 also had excellent chances in the first half , but neither could convert .			0

@entity115 appeared to pull his hamstring and was stretchered off
@entity5 was also substituted after *62* minutes for a *quiet* display
both sides now have two points in @entity122 with one game remaining
