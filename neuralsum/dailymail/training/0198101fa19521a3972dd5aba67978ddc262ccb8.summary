bogus whiplash claims cost every motorist an extra £ 118 on their annual car insurance bill , it has been revealed			1
premiums have risen by 80 per cent since october 2008 due to the rise in people making costly – and often false – whiplash claims , according to a report by insurance company @entity9			1
the average legal fee for a whiplash claim is £ 2,500 , almost half of which is due to intermediaries , including claims management companies and personal injury lawyers , seeking a cut for themselves			1
the researchers said that if insurers handled claims directly rather than through these third parties , an estimated £ 1.5billion could be stripped from @entity24 motor insurance premiums			1
costly : premiums have risen by 80 per cent since october 2008 due to the rise in people making costly and often false whiplash claims , according to a report by insurance company @entity9 ( file picture ) as a result , industry leaders say it should be a legal requirement for personal injury ( @entity36 ) claimants to contact the ‘ at fault ’ insurer directly rather than going to intermediaries such as claims management companies and @entity36 lawyers			1
@entity9 estimates that handling claims directly will halve the current cost of dealing with the 600,000 whiplash claims made every year			1
this reduction alone could lead to premium falls of around £ 60 a year for the average driver			2
@entity48 , claims director at @entity9 , said : ‘ our figures for average compensation settlements show that dealing with an insurer directly results in at least as much compensation for the claimant and has the advantage of being quicker , meaning their treatment and rehabilitation can start almost immediately			1
‘ it would also prompt a significant reduction in the costs of the current system which would benefit all @entity24 motorists , who will begin to see a reduction in their premiums			0
’ there has been a 70 per cent rise in personal injury claims from road accidents in the past six years			0
the @entity70 believes that more than a quarter of whiplash claims are fake – but an estimated £ 2billion is paid in compensation every year			2
spokesman @entity74 said : ‘ it ’s almost the fraud of choice for too many people			0
‘ while some are genuine , we think many are fraudulent			0
pain : there has been a 70 per cent rise in personal injury claims from road accidents in the past six years ‘ the problem is it ’s very difficult to establish whether you have whiplash injuries			2
’ the findings follow reports last month that police forces have received millions of pounds for passing on the details of road accident victims to claims management companies , insurers and lawyers			0
this may have led to thousands of people being pursued by ‘ cash for crash ’ companies looking to profit out of personal injury claims , fuelling the rise in third party involvement			0
@entity9 ’s report , called ‘ @entity109 by reforming the @entity110 ’ , has been launched ahead of the @entity108 @entity107 , which will close on march 8			2
the study found that 63 per cent of the 2,000 drivers surveyed think that people seek compensation to get money to spend on whatever they choose rather than for rehabilitation			0
research : only a third of people who made an injury claim spent their compensation on medical treatment or physiotherapy according to @entity9 previous research by @entity9 found that only a third of people who made an injury claim spent their compensation on medical treatment or physiotherapy , while a third said it was used to pay off household debt , 12 per cent to buy luxury items such as tvs and 9 per cent to go on holiday			1
more than 50 per cent of those surveyed supported the introduction of an independent panel of medical experts to assess whiplash cases			0
@entity116 also revealed 95 per cent of people believe unnecessary claims are behind premium increases , with 93 per cent naming the rise in whiplash claims specifically			0
the average cost of car insurance reached £ 1,000 for the first time in july last year , according to the @entity144 – more than double that of the price of a typical policy four years ago .			2

the average legal fee for a whiplash claim is £ 2,500 according to @entity9
