by @entity0 @entity2 veteran @entity1 and her late wife , @entity3 , were hoping to spend eternity together , but because of an @entity7 state law defining marriage as only a union between a man and a woman , they will have to be buried apart			1
@entity1 served six years in the @entity2 between 1958 and 1964 before she was dishonorably discharged after a recruit went to her superior and revealed that she and another servicewoman were gay			1
@entity1 ’s status was later amended to honorable on appeal , and now she is entitled to be laid to rest in the @entity16			1
but because @entity1 had a wife who passed away in 2012 , her application to have the two of them interred together has been rejected			1
federal law allows same - sex couples where one of the spouses is a veteran to be laid to rest together in national cemeteries like @entity41 in @entity42 , but the same can not be said of state burial grounds , which are subjected to state laws			2
the @entity45 states : ‘ a marriage between a man and a woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state			1
’ @entity51 of veterans services deputy administrator @entity52 told @entity53 that in @entity1 's case , they have to follow @entity7 's definition of spouse			2
angered by her predicament , @entity1 has taken up the cause of same - sex military couples with the goal of changing the @entity45			1
then and now : @entity1 pictured left in 1959 , when she was in the @entity2 ; @entity1 's mugshot ( right ) following her march 2014 arrest at an add the words protest at the @entity64 ‘ normally i stammer and stutter myself			1
i 'm not a public speaker , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ i 'm a background person			0
i work in the background			0
what 's changed is i got mad at the cemetery , and decided it 's time to do something about it			0
’ as a @entity2 veteran , @entity1 can be buried with her deceased wife in another veterans cemetery , but the 74 - year - old long - time @entity7 resident does not want to settle			1
‘ i just feel that it 's the right place for me			0
you know , i 'm a veteran			0
so they should let me ... in fact they would let me alone , be in that crypt , ’ @entity1 said			2
' but i do n't want to alone			0
i want @entity3 with me			0
’ for @entity1 and @entity3 , it was love at first sight when the two women met in 1995			1
later that same year , the happy couple held a symbolic wedding ceremony in @entity90			0
in 2008 , the life partners legally tied the knot in @entity93 not long before the passage of @entity95 banning same - sex marriages			1
then two years ago , @entity3 passed away from complications related to emphysema , and her widow decided that it was time to make final arrangements for herself as her health has gone into decline			0
‘ i 'm a stroke waiting to happen , ’ @entity1 told @entity104 wednesday			0
since 2012 , @entity1 has kept her wife 's ashes at home , waiting to be laid to rest with her own remains when her time came			1
@entity1 said she was not surprised when her request to be buried with @entity3 was rejected by the state veterans cemetery			1
‘ i 've been discriminated against for 70 years , and they might as well discriminate against me in death as well as life , ’ she said			0
the 74 - year - old veteran said that the cemetery plot has plenty of space to house both her and her wife 's ashes , so they would not have to take up any additional space			2
‘ i do n't see where the ashes of a couple old lesbians is going to hurt anyone , ’ @entity1 said			2
the ailing septuagenarian has since joined the @entity127 the four words protest to change the state constitution , which so far has landed her in jail on two separate occasions			0
if @entity1 passes away before the law is amended , she has made arrangements for someone to hold onto her and @entity3 's ashes until they are permitted to be interred together			1
‘ eventually i 'm going to be there			0
they might as well give up and let us go now , ’ @entity1 stated .			0

@entity2 veteran @entity1 , 74 , wants to be buried in @entity16 with her wife , @entity3 , who died in 2012
@entity45 defines marriage only as a union between a man and a woman
@entity1 is entitled to be interred with her late spouse in a national military cemetery , but the veteran says she does n't want to settle
@entity1 and @entity3 met in 1995 and legally married in 2008 in @entity93
