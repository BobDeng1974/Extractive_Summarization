thick and heavy cloud has killed - off the best views of wednesday night 's rare lunar eclipse as the highly anticipated event fizzled out in skies over @entity6			1
the blood moon event , which astronomers were promising would make for spectacular viewing , failed to live up to to the hype many were hoping as a band of high cloud blocked the best views			1
despite the disappointment , hundreds gathered at spots across the city hoping for a glimpse of the burgundy sphere			0
professional and amateur photographers were about with lenses of all sizes , but their chances of snapping a clear shot of the event are slim due to thick , heavy low cloud			1
' that does n't help anyone see through it , ' a @entity42 spokesman told @entity46			0
' @entity47 ( thursday ) night is probably a much better night for viewing the sky , which tends to happen with these things sometimes			0
' many were parked beneath the @entity31 at about 10pm a dull , dark beige moon briefly appeared , prompting members of the crowd to reach for their cameras			0
for those prepared to travel , the best spot to see the eclipse was the @entity58 , west of @entity28 , or further west			1
astronomer @entity60 of @entity62 's @entity61 says a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth moves between the sun and the moon , casting a shadow across the moon that causes it to turn a blood red colour			1
a lot of the country 's east coast is affected by the cloud , but with a lunar eclipse happening at least twice a year stargazers should n't have to wait long for another chance to observe the phenomenon			1
and it 's expected that seven will occur in 2038			0
@entity80 @entity6 will see the total eclipse , but will miss the entire passage of the earth 's shadow across the face of the moon because the eclipse begins before the moon rises over the state			2
the eclipse is the second of four total lunar eclipses , starting with a first ' blood moon ' on april 15 , in a series astronomers call a tetrad			1
a slight tinge of red can be seen hovering over the city of @entity28 on wednesday night a red moon will be visible in @entity6 and other parts of the world on wednesday a senior lecturer at @entity104 explained : ' a blood moon occurs when the orbit of the @entity107 is nearly perfectly aligned with the orbit of the @entity109 around the @entity110 ' the simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises on the rim of the @entity109 , make the @entity107 red			1
' with a small pair of binoculars people will also be able to spot @entity118 about ' two moon widths away ' from the the blood moon			1
the eclipse will happen two more times over the next two years as part of this cycle , on april 4 and september 28 , 2015			1
the next @entity126 cycle wo n't occur until 2032			2
' if we were on the moon during this eclipse , we would see a bright orange - red ring in the sky where the @entity109 should be			2
the light from that bright ring bathes the moon in a reddish glow , which we can see from @entity109			0
in this photo people watch as the ' @entity140 ' rises over the water in @entity142 , @entity62 , on april 15 a blood moon occurs when the moon passes in to the shadow of @entity109 called the umbra it is described as the ' simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises ' some @entity151 are concerned that the celestial event could mark the start of terrible events , based on a passage from the @entity156 that says : ' the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the @entity161 comes			1
' in 1493 , the first @entity126 saw the expulsion of @entity163 by the @entity164			2
the second happened in 1949 , right after the @entity165 was founded and the most recent one - in 1967 - happened during the @entity166 between @entity167 and @entity165			0
@entity168 , a @entity169 pastor who has written a book on the @entity126 called ' @entity171 : something is about to @entity173 ' told the @entity174 that the first of the blood moons in 2014 took place right in the middle of the @entity163 holiday of @entity180			1
dr @entity136 said that ' anywhere down the @entity182 ' is the best place to view it the second , on october 8 , occurs during the @entity184 and the third will be on april 4 , 2015 , also during @entity180			1
the final one happens on september 28 , 2015 , which is also during the @entity188			1
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity109			2
this is an area known as the umbra , where light from the sun is blocked by our planet			0
the light refracts differently in the atmosphere and , as it hits the moon , it appears red			0
this gives rise to its ' blood red ' appearance during a total eclipse , when the entire moon is in shadow			2
if it skirts the shadow , known as a partial or penumbral eclipse , the effect is less dramatic			0
when the moon first enters the @entity109 's partial shadow , know as the penumbra , a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon			0
this gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks			0
at the eclipse 's peak , the moon enters the @entity109 's full shadow ; the umbra			2
at this stage , the @entity109 's atmosphere scatters the sun 's red visible light ; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset			0
as a result , the red light reflects off the moon 's surface , casting a reddish rust hue over it .			0

chances of snapping a clear shot of the event were slim due to thick , heavy and low cloud particularly over @entity28
for those who were prepared to travel , the best spot to see the eclipse was @entity58 , west of @entity28 , or further west .
the ' blood moon ' was being *billed* as better than the last in april this year
the even happens at a ' simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and
the final two ' blood moons ' of this @entity126 will happen on april 4 and september 28 , 2015
