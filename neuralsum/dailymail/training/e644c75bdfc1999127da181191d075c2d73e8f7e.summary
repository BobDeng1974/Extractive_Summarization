by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has outlined his vision to take @entity4 forward and is targeting up to five quality additions to bolster his squad			1
though @entity2 has vowed to fight until the final whistle on sunday , he has conceded @entity4 ’s hopes of winning their first title since 1990 have almost been extinguished after only taking one point from their last two games against @entity13 and @entity14			1
but wherever @entity4 finish this campaign , @entity2 is aware that improvements need to be made to the squad during the summer and believes the fact they can guarantee @entity21 football will give them a considerable lure			1
top target : @entity25 ( right ) is wanted by @entity4 this summer @entity4 did not sign anyone in january but their scouts have identified a number of targets , including @entity30 ’s @entity25 and @entity32 defender @entity31 , as having the potential to improve the squad and take the club forward			1
‘ the work has been on - going for a little while now , especially since we consolidated a place in the @entity21 , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i think we are a real attractive proposition to players through @entity41			2
we are right on the football map now but we have got work to do			2
‘ we will see how quickly we can get things done			2
i meet regularly with the recruitment boys			2
for them and their status when they are going to games in @entity41 , meeting agents and watching players , it has been great ( being in the @entity21 already )			1
‘ but we have to work hard to make the right decision for the right type of player to come in here			2
but there is no doubt it helps you a great deal			0
last year we spoke to a number of targets but ( missed out as ) they wanted @entity21 football			1
’ there is little doubt @entity4 ’s lack of depth – players to change games – has proved costly this season , compared to a @entity71 side he has described as “ having the highest wage bill in the history of sport ”			1
defensive rock : @entity31 is another name on @entity4 's shortlist ‘ the players we brought in last summer were young and for cover , ’ he said			1
‘ now we need to bring in starters			0
one of the things watching the @entity71 game the other night , they bring on ( @entity86 ) @entity85 , who scores – £ 23million ; @entity89 £ 29million and ( @entity91 ) @entity90 £ 20million			0
‘ that level of player to bring into the game is massive for you and this year the reality is we ’ve been unable to do that			0
’ @entity2 has admitted the draw at @entity14 on monday night , when @entity4 shipped three goals in nine minutes after leading 3 - 0 , was the ' lowest he has felt in football ' but he believes the chastening experience at @entity101 will actually help his side progress			1
‘ sometimes i will say something after the game but i said nothing , ’ he said			0
‘ i had my own thoughts and watched the game again on the way back before i went home ; we ’ve spoken this week and look to move on			0
there is a great deal of learning will come out of that game			0
it ’s a great reference point			0
‘ but this is only the beginning for us			0
i hear about how other teams will improve next season but i think we will improve dramatically			0
even people like @entity116 will improve dramatically next season			0
we are really excited about the future			0
’ man with the plan : @entity2 ( right ) is preparing to launch a spending spree this summer			1

@entity25 and @entity31 are among @entity4 's top targets
