@entity0 , 22 , was jailed for six years for the ' terrifying ' attack , which left his 31 - year - old victim afraid to go out a woman was forced to jump into a canal to escape a dangerous serial sex attacker who threatened to kill her - but he will not serve a day for the crime			1
@entity0 , 22 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , was jailed for six years for the ' terrifying ' attack , which left his 31 - year - old victim afraid to go out alone			1
@entity10 heard the incident took place less than 18 months after @entity0 was released early from prison for an earlier series of sex attacks			1
@entity0 stalked his victim , who can not be named for legal reasons , as she walked home from work on october 7 , 2014			2
as she passed through a nature reserve near @entity22 in @entity8 , @entity9 , at around 3.45pm , the defendant began following her			0
when she noticed him he started to run towards her shouting : ' i have a knife and i will kill you			0
' prosecutor @entity27 said @entity0 , who was brandishing a 10cms long knife , grabbed the woman and told her : ' i will kill you if you do n't do what i want you to do			1
' mr @entity27 said : ' she thought the only way to get away from him was to jump in the river			0
' the woman then told @entity0 she would do whatever he wanted , which appeared to take him by surprise and gave her the chance to slip free from his grasp and jump into the canal			1
@entity0 immediately ran off but the victim remained in the water for some time , scared he was still in the area			2
the victim eventually returned home and reported the incident to police the following day , describing her attacker as looking like an actor from @entity51 drama @entity52			0
@entity0 was arrested after being picked out of an identity parade on october 10 and he was charged the next day			0
he gave a no comment during his interview but at a court hearing on january 7 he admitted a charge of making threats to kill , committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence and threatening with a bladed article			0
@entity10 ( pictured ) heard @entity0 carried out the attack less than 18 months after being released early from prison for an earlier series of sex attacks in a victim impact statement the woman described how she now takes the bus everywhere rather than walking alone and sees a potential attacker in every man she encounters			1
after his arrest @entity0 was recalled to prison to serve the rest of his previous licence period			1
that sentence related to a hearing at @entity78 in 2011 when , aged 18 years , @entity0 was jailed for four years with a three - year licence for sexual assault , three counts of sexual activity with a child and causing actual bodily harm			2
' this was , without question , a terrifying experience for your victim , ' judge @entity85 told @entity0 , who appeared via video link from @entity91			1
the judge then blasted @entity93 for laws which meant he could not jail @entity0 for longer than his prison recall for the previous sex attacks , meaning he will ' literally not serve a day ' behind bars for the latest offence			1
the judge blasted @entity93 for laws which meant he could not jail the 22 - year - old for longer than his prison recall for the previous sex attacks ' that is a consequence which , i feel bound to say , i deplore but about which i can do nothing , ' judge @entity85 told @entity0 as he sentenced him via video link at @entity10			1
judge @entity85 described @entity0 as ' one of the more dangerous men ' he had come across during his lengthy career , saying it was a ' chilling ' case			1
judge @entity85 said the defendant had an ' alarming ' history and said he was plainly a danger to the public			0
however , the judge said that because of laws introduced in 2003 and the fact that @entity0 would be released halfway through his latest sentence , he would effectively not serve a day behind bars for the canal attack			1
' apart from the effect of your recall , you will be entitled to release from the sentence i now impose at the halfway point , thus three years from today , which would be march 9 , 2018 , ' said judge @entity85			0
' because of the licence recall , you will not be released until may 13 , 2018 , a mere seven weeks later			0
' because @entity93 in its wisdom chose in 2003 to abolish the power to return a prisoner to custody to serve the unexpired portion of licence and then to order the fresh sentence to run consecutively to that recall , the effect of my order is that you will literally not serve a day longer for the offences for which you are now sentenced			2
' when he is released , @entity0 will remain on licence for 10 years			2
in mitigation , @entity141 said : ' as far as this offending goes and this very brave victim , he is sorry			0
' he is still young and young enough perhaps for there to be a hope of change			0
' @entity0 was jailed for six years for making threats to kill and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence			2
he will serve a two year sentence for threatening with a bladed article concurrently			0
he was also handed an indefinite @entity154 , having already been given a 10 - year order in 2011 .			0
