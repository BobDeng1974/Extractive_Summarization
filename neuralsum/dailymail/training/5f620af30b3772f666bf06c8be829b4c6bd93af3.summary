by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 14:54 est , 22 may 2012 a fisherman has caught what is thought to be a record - breaking snakehead in the waters of the @entity5 in @entity6			1
the whopper was four foot long and weighed in at 18lbs - 1lb heavier than the previous record caught in @entity9			1
snakehead fish have become a pest in @entity6 after infiltrating the waters a decade ago - being nicknamed frankenfish because of their unfortunate looks			1
what lies beneath : this terrifying snakehead fish could be a world record breaker - weighing in at 18lbs @entity18 : the snakehead fish has been nicknamed the @entity20 because of its repulsive appearance the state of @entity6 are keen to rid the @entity23 of the fish because it is a voracious top - level predator , meaning that it has no natural enemies , and could decimate populations of native fish			1
about 90 per cent of it 's diet consists of other fish and it is even known to swallow sea bass whole			2
but this snakehead fish is anything but ugly to @entity36 who was beaming as he was interviewed about his catch by a local news reporter from @entity39			2
smiling : @entity40 is thrilled at the catch and tells @entity39 that he does n't think the fish are ugly at all ' they 'll take your thumb off ! ' : @entity36 warns that you should n't touch the beasts from beneath while they are still alive grinning @entity36 said : ' i think they are really cool looking , i like the way they look			0
they fight hard and they are really aggressive but you can catch them on any bass fishing lures			0
' he told how you should n't touch the fish while it was still alive because its fangs would ' tear your thumb off ' and how he thought the fish 's pattern looked like a ' diamond - back rattlesnake '			0
it 's been eight years since a snakehead fish was discovered in the @entity67			2
but biologists would rather see them gone and the state have offered to give the angler with the biggest catch a $ 200 gift certificate			0
' @entity73 and aggressive ' : at 18lbs the it needs strength and dedication to reel a snakehead in fangs : luckily this snakehead is dead but you would n't want to have your fingers so close to a live one			0

the snakehead fish , caught in @entity6 , @entity20 , was 1lb heavier than the previous record breaker caught in @entity9
they have become a pest because of their *indiscriminate* feeding habits
