by @entity0 published : 08:53 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 09:03 est , 11 november 2013 @entity1 insists he 's a changed man			1
the old @entity1 was a notorious stock swindler who squandered profits from a boiler - room , ' pump and dump ' scheme on cocaine , prostitutes and other excesses - a story that became basis for two memoirs and @entity10 an upcoming movie starring @entity12			1
the new @entity1 is a business consultant who claims he would never tell a lie and frets over recent suggestions that he may be avoiding payments on $ 110 million in restitution by hiding his profits from the book and movie deals			1
notorious stock swindler @entity1 insists that he 's given up lying and despite a recent fuss over his finances , is n't hiding his money @entity12 is appearing in a forthcoming film based on the scam , @entity10 of @entity31 ' it 's very strange being accused of something i would n't have done in a million years , " the 51 - year @entity1 said			1
' it 's so not where my head is at			2
' in early october , prosecutors asked a federal judge in @entity39 to find @entity1 in default , saying he paid only $ 11.6 million of the $ 110 million he owes as restitution for a securities fraud and money laundering conviction			1
they have since withdrawn the request to see if a settlement can be worked out - but not before a wave of bad press portraying @entity1 as a deadbeat			1
' in some weird way , it probably helps the movie , ' he said in a recent phone interview			0
' it does n't help me			0
' the film - directed by @entity56 and set for release on christmas day - chronicles the boyish , fast - talking @entity1 's antics as chairman of @entity60 , the firm he started with a few desks and phones set up in a former @entity64 auto shop			1
' @entity12 's amazing , a brilliant actor , ' @entity1 said			1
' i spent hundreds of hours with him			0
and @entity56 's brilliant too			2
' @entity60 made a fortune by using deceptive , high - pressure tactics to peddle penny stocks at inflated prices			1
after artificially pumping the value up , @entity1 and others would dump their own shares before prices crashed			1
@entity72 , of behavioural profiling firm @entity73 , and @entity1 set up a joint venture on the ethics of business @entity1 and his cronies ended up making more cash than they knew what to do with : a movie trailer shows a smirking @entity12 crumpling up $ 100 bills and throwing them in a waste basket			1
he spent part of his ill - gotten gains on a 166 - foot yacht - which sank - and a $ 175,000 sports car			2
looking back , he says becoming rich by deceit was n't worth it			0
' fraud is not something you want to be good at , ' he said			2
' i was always taking great efforts to cover my tracks			0
' it was unbelievably exhausting , keeping track of all the lies			0
... i think that 's why i lived so recklessly			2
you 're doing things that you know ca n't go on indefinitely			0
it fuels that insane lifestyle			0
' @entity1 pleaded guilty in 1999 and agreed to become a government witness in a case against an accountant and other stock fraud defendants accused of cooking the firm 's books and funneling money into a bogus holding company and overseas bank accounts			1
in 2003 , after a broken marriage and a bout with drug addiction , @entity1 was sentenced to three and a half years behind bars and ordered to chip away at the $ 110 million restitution by giving 50 percent of his future earnings to the government			1
@entity12 ( pictured ) stars in the movie about @entity1 's extravagant ' greed is good ' lifestyle book sales resulted in payments of about $ 700,000 from 2007 to 2009 , court papers say			1
but after completing probation in 2010 , prosecutors claim @entity1 's payments have slowed to a trickle - even after he made $ 940,500 off the sale of the ' @entity136 ' movie rights and continued to capitalize on his notoriety as a motivational speaker and business consultant			1
under those circumstances , it 's not surprising that the government went on the offensive , said @entity144 , a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in @entity146			0
' i think it 's a little bit in - your - face when you write books and help make movies about your crimes , especially when the crimes are why you owe restitution , ' @entity144 said			1
in the interview , @entity1 said he now can make tens of thousands of dollars for speaking engagements and other services			2
his website boasts that he 's developed a system to ' take virtually any company or individual ... and empower them to create massive wealth , abundance and entrepreneurial success , without sacrificing integrity or ethics , ' and features testimonials of heads of telecommunications and real estate companies in @entity173			0
' @entity175 is no longer a criminal , ' his fianc√©e , @entity174 , wrote in a recent letter to the judge			0
' " he is an exemplary contributor to the economy			0
he is a taxpayer and a very hard - working man			0
' as to his current problems with the law , @entity1 's lawyers have argued that his obligation to pay half his earnings ended when he went off probation			1
still , he claims he 's repeatedly offered to pay 100 per cent of his book and movie profits and to negotiate a settlement on restitution , only to be met with silence			2
' there 's so much distrust , ' @entity1 said of the prosecutors			1
' most people lie to them			0
i do n't want to make any money from the books or the movie			0
i do n't think they could fathom that			0
' someone like @entity1 bemoaning a lack of trust is outrageous , said @entity207 , a @entity208 , @entity209 , lawyer who once represented some of his victims			2
she recalled that one of her clients , after being duped by a cold call from @entity60 , sold the family farm so he could invest			0
' no one should consider him trustworthy , ' @entity207 said of @entity1			2
' he is the consummate con man , winning the confidence of the naive , the trusting and the greedy by calculatedly selling people what they wanted to believe			0
' in a letter dated october 25 , prosecutors told the judge they 're reviewing documents turned over by @entity1 before the case returns to court later this month			1
he 's hoping for a quick resolution so he can move on			0
' i just want to finally close out that chapter of my life , ' he said .			0
