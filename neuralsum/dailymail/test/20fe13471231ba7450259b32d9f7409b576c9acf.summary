but with the cost of maintenance and repairs to damaged public housing nearing $ 13 million a year in @entity11 alone , the @entity6 has had enough and is planning to make tenants pay a bond before they move in			1
communities minister @entity14 said it was a ' very likely possibility ' the plan would be implemented in the near future			2
' the critical argument for it is that at the moment the maintenance costs , including damage from poor tenancy , are in the order of approximately $ 12 - 13 million per year , ' mr @entity14 told @entity25			1
a picture from the @entity11 @entity27 shows damage to public housing public housing tenants will pay a bond under a @entity11 government plan to recoup losses from trashed properties the state 's new community services minister @entity14 said the annual bill for repairs and maintenance on taxpayer - funded housing had hit $ 12 million mr @entity14 added that he was unsure as to why public housing tenants have never been made to pay a bond similar to that paid by private renters ' i 'd like to see at least a reasonable portion of that money saved and put into more public housing			1
we have very long public housing tenancy waiting lists			2
' mr @entity14 , who took over the portfolio after the march election , said he was alerted to the fact public housing tenants do n't pay a bond when consulting with workers in the field			1
he added that introducing a bond was not a new idea or ' rocket science '			0

' this is about sending a forward message , a very clear and upfront message , that you will be responsible for the damage			0
' @entity98 , policy officer at the @entity99 , said public housing tenants were already liable if they caused damage to properties			1
' tenants are always liable for the damage they cause , the question of the bond is really just about making sure there 's a little bit of money there so landlords can have ready access to money , ' mr @entity98 said			2
' i do n't think the government should be looking at that in the same way as private landlord , who might struggle to cover costs			0
' the government landlord is n't going to find themselves in a situation where they 're going to be short of cash			0

' problems occur when properties are left vacant for too long , and that 's not an issue that can be solved by hitting tenants up for more money			0
' mr @entity98 added : ' households who are entering social housing tenancy are facing a number of challenges , and one of those challenges is necessarily a financial one			0
' and to place an additional financial burden on people under those circumstances should be a difficult decision for a minister to make			0
