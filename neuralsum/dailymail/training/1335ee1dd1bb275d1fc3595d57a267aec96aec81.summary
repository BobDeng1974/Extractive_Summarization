with neatly plucked eyebrows , leather boots with heels and a gold bracelet , ' @entity0 ' as she has become known is the last person you 'd expect to find looking down the sight of a sniper rifle in the middle of a bloody civil war			1
but a former @entity11 teacher has found unlikely fame on the streets of @entity15 's largest city becoming known to many residents as ' the female sniper '			1
dressed in a jumper dress , hijab and green khaki trousers , @entity0 , named after the @entity22 revolutionary , sits hidden in a war damaged building waiting for a sight of the enemy - government troops			1
she says that she waits for hours to get a sight of a government soldier take aim : the 36 - year - old looks down the sight of her rifle			1
she fights against government soldiers following the death of her two children who were killed in an airstrike danger : the former @entity11 teacher first picked up a weapon at a training camp run by @entity49 militant group @entity48 although fighting is not often considered the right way to behave for a woman in a conservative @entity54 country , @entity0 holds her own in a group of fellow fighters - some 30 men and boys			1
and she claims to be happy in her unusual and dangerous role			0
she told the @entity61 : ' i like fighting			0
when i see that one of my friends in my katiba [ rebel division ] has been killed , i feel that i have to hold a weapon and take my revenge			2
' the 36 - year - old is motivated by the death of her children several months ago , a daughter aged 10 and a son aged seven			1
the pair were killed when an airstrike hit the family home			2
now she says she feels compelled to kill a government soldier every time she learns of the death of one of her fellow rebel fighters			0
patience : @entity0 watches the enemy lines through her sniper sight on the frontline in @entity88 the job , she says , takes patience , speed and intelligence , and she often has to sit for hours waiting for civilians to clear the streets and government soldiers to take their place			1
she watches soldiers and civilians trying to get on with their everyday lives from her hidden vantage point , but does n't shoot until just the soldiers roam the streets			0
and despite being unsure whether she has killed them or not , @entity0 claims to have hit four or five soldiers			2
' it makes you feel good			0
whenever i hit one i shout " yes ! " , ' she said			0
originally from @entity110 , the sniper told the @entity61 that she first picked up a gun at a military training camp in @entity113 run by @entity49 militants from the @entity48 group			0
smiling assassin : @entity0 smiles for the camera on the front line in @entity29 even before the uprising against @entity121 's regime began in the spring of 2011 , @entity0 says that she was staunchly opposed to his rule , helping to create an underground opposition newspaper while studying at @entity124			1
she was even part of an underground political party for @entity49 who met to plot the defeat of @entity121 's regime			2
her first marriage broke down because her husband was not revolutionary enough and she threatened to leave her new husband , the leader of her rebel brigade , when he initially refused to let her fight			0
despite her hardened attitude to her role , @entity0 says that she sometimes wakes up crying in the night over the death of her children and the horrors she has seen			2
