@entity3 's teleprompter did freeze in @entity5 on saturday , the former @entity1 governor claimed during a tuesday night interview in which a @entity8 host asked her about her rambling and at times incoherent speech that sent her political stock plummeting			1
the admission came in a freewheeling television segment with host @entity13 in which she declared war on his fellow host @entity16 for not taking her and real estate tycoon @entity17 seriously as politicians			1
@entity3 also downplayed reports from days earlier that she was planning to run for president in the first place			1
' i was asked by a testy reporter while i was promoting my @entity26 show , " @entity25 with @entity3 " , ' the self - promoting pol told @entity8 host @entity13			1
' i was asked if i were to be interested at all in running for office , maybe the presidency			0
' ' and it 's certainly not newsworthy , ' she added with a shrug and an eye roll , ' for me to have answered , " oh yeah , i 'm interested , yeah			0
but she defended herself tuesday night on @entity8			2
' did the teleprompter go down ? did you have trouble with the copy ? ' @entity13 asked her			2
' was there any moment in the speech where you had any difficulty ? because people have been so critical			2
' @entity3 insisted that ' i do n't read the praise and i do n't read the criticism			1
... i 'm used to teleprompters not working			0
' ' remember the @entity75 acceptance speech back in ' 08 ? the teleprompter broke there too			1
it did n't work , and i kept on going			2
' that 's an exaggeration , according to journalists who were in @entity81 , @entity82 the night she accepted the role as @entity87 sen. @entity86 's running mate that would vault her onto the national stage			0
' the teleprompter did not break , ' reporter @entity92 , then of @entity93 , wrote at the time			2
' @entity3 delivered a powerful speech last night , but she did not " wing it "			1
' ' i was sitting in the press section next to the stage , within easy eyeshot of the teleprompter , ' he wrote			0
' i frequently looked up at the machine , and there was no serious malfunction			0
a top convention planner confirms this morning that there were no major problems			0
' @entity110 blogger @entity109 wrote much the same thing : that he was ' was sitting in the press section , ( behind @entity3 and off to her right side )			2
i had a clear view of the @entity115 , and read along with her			0
' in saturday 's @entity5 speech , however , she was indeed improvising			1
( this reporter , sitting above her in the front row of the stage - right balcony , saw the prompter freeze – and stay frozen			2
) ' the man can only ride you when your back is bent , ' she said at one point , as audience members looked at each other quizzically			0
' so strengthen it ! then the man ca n't ride you , @entity129 wo n't get taken for a ride , because so much is at stake			0
' @entity132 : @entity3 's audience often seemed unsure what to make of her as she babbled and danced from subject to subject making little sense on tuesday she lashed out at @entity16 for treating her and @entity17 like long - shot candidates – insisting that a cable network perceived to lean right should back her all the way addressing the controversy over the virtues of the @entity143 @entity142 and the ' @entity145 ' film that tells his life story , she shouted : “ screw the left in @entity148 ! ' and at one point she lashed out at @entity151 terrorists in a style all her own			1
' what we do is strengthen our military , ' she said			0
' we respect our troops and let them – our troops as our gatekeepers – we let them tell jihadists , " uh - uh , this is our house ! get the hell out "			0
' the 35 - minute performance was so uneven that @entity164 communications director @entity163 issued a two - word statement afterward : ' thank you ! ' @entity3 spoke at the @entity5 event alongside a host of others whose names have been floated as potential @entity75 candidates , including @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			1
her position near the end of the lineup indicated that the event 's hosts , @entity178 and @entity5 congressman @entity180 , hoped the @entity1 would be a showstopper			1
she nearly stopped the entire show			0
@entity3 , a @entity8 contributor , took a shot at top - rated host @entity16 on tuesday for dismissing her as a third'tier potential candidate , even as she sought to distance herself from any expectation that she might run			1
@entity188 & @entity189 : @entity8 host @entity16 dismissed @entity3 and @entity17 on tuesday as third - tier politicians who merely ' liven up the proceedings ' @entity17 , a multibillionaire real estate tycoon , says he 's serious about throwing his hat in the ring this time around , after several previous campaigns where he folded his tent before the process got properly underway @entity16 had handicapped the fast - moving @entity42 primary season two hours earlier , saying that ' @entity3 and @entity17 certainly liven up the proceedings , but they need effective organizations in 50 states and that will be a major challenge for them			1
' @entity3 was n't amused , and lashed out at him for not siding with her and other conservatives			2
' @entity207 will be running , ' she said , referring to @entity164 former secretary of state @entity207 , ' and she will be , you know , the knighted candidate on the left and with the media			0
' ' knowing what the media is going to do , it 's gon na take more than a village to beat @entity207			0
there needs to be unity , understanding that we have that – conservatives have that strike against us , you know , right off the bat			0
' she complained about how @entity16 had been teasing his show all day on @entity8 , which she labeled ' kind of a quasi- or assumed - conservative outlet , ' ' and that would be , " oh , all these @entity75 contenders thinking about running for president – like @entity17 , @entity3			1
" and he names ' em off , he says , " oh , what a reality show that would be ! @entity237 , yuk ! " ' ' well the left does n't do that , okay ? they , they , they take this serious , because this is war ! and hopefully the media , even the quasi-right side of the media , wo n't be looking at this as some kind of reality show , a joke			1

former @entity1 governor and @entity251 *darling* gave a confusing speech on saturday in @entity5 , rambling after her teleprompter froze
she said tuesday that her teleprompter broke during her 2008 vice presidential nomination acceptance speech too , ' and i kept on going ' – an account *disputer* by reporters who were there
appearing on ' @entity265 , ' @entity3 *blasted* his fellow host @entity16 for not taking her and real estate tycoon @entity17 seriously as politicians
' he says , " oh , what a reality show that would be ! @entity237 , yuk ! " well , the left does n't do that , okay ? ' she *carped*
but she also downplayed news stories saying she was seriously thinking about a @entity279 campaign , *blaming* ' a testy reporter '
@entity16 had said @entity3 and real estate mogul @entity17 merely ' liven up the proceedings '
