' a statement issued friday by @entity4 's lawyer , @entity128 , in response to allegations of sexual assault against the comic : ' the new , never - before - heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated , fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30 , 40 , or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity			1
these brand new claims about alleged decades - old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous , and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing , done nothing , and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years			0
lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye every day			0
there has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich , powerful men , so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted			2
this situation is an unprecedented example of the media 's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards			0
over and over again , we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence , only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork			0
