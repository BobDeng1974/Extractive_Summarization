the jurors , who had been listening to evidence at the @entity51 hearing for three days , said safety checks should have been carried out			2
they stated : ' we believe there were health and safety systems in place but are not confident that these systems would have avoided any danger posed by the mirror			0
in any case , these systems do not seem to have been followed			0
' the coroner said he is writing a report about the case to the chief coroner in the hope of preventing future incidents			0
mr @entity27 said : ' it is surprising to me that the mirror stayed in its position for possibly up to six months with staff and customers moving its wings			0
sadly , this was an accident waiting to happen and sadly it happened to young @entity0			1
' you would not expect such a heavy mirror to be free - standing and unsupported in any way			1

the youngster underwent an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain evidence from health and safety experts suggested the mirror would have been ' very unstable ' as it stood on the floor , that there was ' no form of free - standing support ' , and that opening the wings of the mirror would change the centre of gravity , causing it to fall forwards			1
the coroner said health and safety systems had been ' in place but were not followed ' and that this lack of understanding and responsibility was something that ' seems to be accepted ' by @entity11			0
