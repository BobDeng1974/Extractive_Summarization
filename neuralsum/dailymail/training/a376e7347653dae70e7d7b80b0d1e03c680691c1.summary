' @entity10 did nothing to alert authorities and kept up the contact rather than bringing phone to the attention of @entity61 the escape occurred on april 30 after @entity12 instructed @entity10 ’s law firm to represent him after he was charged over raids on pawnbrokers in @entity25 and @entity24 where jewellery was stolen in daylight smash - and - grab raids			1
@entity10 sent her text messages on april 4 after he was remanded in custody to await sentence for conspiracy to rob and aggravated vehicle taking			1

at @entity105 magistrates she burst into tears after she was warned she faced over six months in jail after she admitted assisting an offender			1
district judge @entity109 sent her to crown court saying the case was so serious her powers of sentencing were not sufficient enough			0
she told @entity114 : ' you turned a blind eye to the fact that one of your clients had a mobile phone in prison			1
as a result you facilitated him accessing that mobile phone			1
you should have alerted someone			0
' not only does that cause security problems for the prison but it brings the legal profession into disrepute			0
the fact he escaped shows the impact that this had			0
you also failed to tell him to desist from contacting you			0
' a gang of masked men believed to be using gps technology to track the police van blocked it with a @entity33 car the prison van guard was threatened with a sawn off shotgun before the gang smashed the windows of the vehicle prosecutor @entity61 said : ' a significant amount of planning into that escape was conducted by mobile phones held illegally			1
a phone used by @entity12 was active between march 8 and april 24			2
' the sim card was recovered from his cell but the handset was not recovered			0
the handset was the one used in the escape and that has not been found			0
' @entity10 ’s personal telephone number came to the attention of the police			2

' she was under no illusions that she was in contact with a phone that was held illegally			2
they talked about a potential sentence for @entity12			2
police investigating the breakout later examined the sim and found three text messages from @entity10 on it @entity12 and another inmate escaped from the truck and all five jumped back into the @entity33 car which was dumped further down the street ' @entity10 did nothing to alert authorities and kept up the contact rather than bringing phone to the attention of authorities			1
' had the prison authorities been notified about the phone then their actions may have been different and that may well have affected the escape of the prisoners			2
her failure to notify authorities may have aided the escape			0
' @entity10 should have been aware of the serious nature of this			2
she was an experienced legal representative			0
she ca n’t have failed to have been aware of he serious impact of phones in prison			0
' in mitigation @entity10 ’s lawyer @entity200 said : ' she should have informed someone in her office and should n’t have sent those three texts in 13 minutes but the context is about a sentence he was going to receive			2
' the sim cards were seized a week before his escape			0
my client did n’t have anything to do with his escape			0
she certainly has been foolish but there was n’t any serious criminality behind it			0
