the traditional @entity26 pudding gets a insect makeover and is studded with mealworms swimming in worms : @entity68 also make an appearance in the mixed vegetable gravy genius combination : locusts on the @entity14 sprouts provide a crunch to the otherwise soggy offering ' if people ate less cow , sheep , pig and chicken and ate more bugs instead , everything would balance			2

' it was just like an incredible explosion of taste in my mouth , i had never eaten anything like it			0
' but it was only in 2011 that he started doing more research into insect eating - or entomophagy			0
' i discovered that insects have twice as much protein than beef and far more omega - 3 fatty acids than in fish			1
