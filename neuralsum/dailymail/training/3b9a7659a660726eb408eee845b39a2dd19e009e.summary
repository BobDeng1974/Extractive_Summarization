@entity1 attorney general @entity0 got so upset about @entity3 investigation into @entity4 that he vented to colleagues in 2011 about @entity3 congressional investigator @entity6 ' and his idiot cronies			1
' the angry remark appears in an email holder sent to his top deputies at the @entity12 , calling out the chair of the powerful @entity14			0
the committee was then engaged in a full - court press to get to the bottom of @entity4 , an ill - fated program through which the @entity12 's @entity19 ( @entity19 ) told @entity1 gun dealers in border states to make illegal firearms sales in large numbers to buyers who planned to traffick them to @entity26			1
the @entity28 administration hoped to track the weapons to drug cartel kingpins , but 65 per cent of the 2,000 firearms involved were never recovered			2
scroll down to read the email ' @entity33 ' : the depths of outgoing attorney general @entity0 's hatred for @entity3 @entity14 chairman @entity6 slipped out in an email just released @entity38 ' involved straw - buyers who sent 2,000 gus to @entity26 with help from the @entity19 , which hoped to track the firearms to drug cartels – but failed @entity33 on the @entity44 : rep. @entity6 ( right ) presides over the powerful @entity14 , which has dragged @entity45 and @entity46 ( @entity19 ) officials to @entity48 to account for the scandal one was the murder weapon that killed @entity52 agent @entity4 in december 2010			1
the @entity0 email was part of a massive document dump that the @entity12 released on @entity56 as @entity1 were occupied with voting and watching , breath - bated , for results			1
little media coverage attended the cache , which amounted to 64,280 pages			0
the @entity12 had refused to turn over those documents , and more , since @entity6 's committee subpoenaed them in october 2011			1
@entity0 was later held in criminal @entity64 for refusing , making him the only presidential cabinet member in @entity1 history to wear that badge of dishonor			0
in the april 15 , 2011 email , @entity0 was responding to threats from @entity6 's committee staffers that they would issue subpoenas to force gun dealers – @entity74 ( @entity75 ) in government - speak – to tell what they knew			1
one @entity74 's attorney shared the back - and - forth with the @entity12			2
@entity79 , then the associate deputy attorney general in the office of the deputy attorney general , described the situation in an email whose subject line was ' possible subpoena for cooperating @entity74			2
' his attorney , @entity79 wrote , had ' told @entity6 ’s staff that his client has a variety of concerns with testifying , including the fact that he is a witness in a criminal matter and concerns for his safety			2
' committee staffers , he added , ' told him that it would be easier to keep this confidential if he was willing to come in for a voluntary interview			0
counsel said that his client did n’t want to			0
' after @entity79 outlined the possibility that @entity6 might issue a subpoena forcing the gun dealer to testify , @entity0 's then - chief of staff @entity101 reached up the chain of command			1
' this keeps escalating , ' he emailed @entity0			0
that 's when his boss lost patience			0
' @entity6 and his idiot cronies never gave a damn about this when all that was happening was that thousands of @entity26 were being killed with guns from our country , ' he fumed in an email to @entity101 , deputy ag @entity120 , and @entity120 's chief of staff @entity122			1
' all they want to do – in reality – is cripple @entity19 and suck up to the gun lobby			0
politics at its worst – maybe the media will get it			2
' @entity4 weapons had already been turning up at the scenes of @entity26 gun crimes before @entity4 , the border patrol agent , was murdered			2
@entity134 : a @entity26 national killed @entity52 agent @entity4 with a gun that the @entity28 administration 's @entity12 allowed a straw - buyer to traffick south of the border no choice : @entity19 agents leaned on gun dealers in the @entity1 southwest to sell guns illegally in order to supply hte @entity4 program with weapons that could be sent into @entity26 @entity6 's investigation has uncovered evidence that a year before @entity0 's angry email outburst , some in the @entity19 sought to use the @entity4 program to build a case for a new gun control measure known inside the government as ' @entity155			1
' that plan was drawn up in order to use sales records from @entity38 - related purchases of large numbers of so - called ' long guns ' – rifles and shotguns designed to be fired while braced against the shooter 's shoulder – to force gun dealers everywhere to report the details of more of their sales to the federal government			1
it was so named because it was the third proposed regulation of its kind , in one july 14 , 2010 email the @entity14 has released , @entity176 assistant director @entity175 asked @entity178 , @entity19 's @entity179 special agent in charge , for help leveraging data from @entity4			0
' @entity178 – can you see if these guns were all purchased from the same ffl and at one time ? ' he asked			0
' we are looking at anecdotal cases to support a demand letter on long gun multiple sales			0
' the massive tranche of emails released tuesday , while the news media 's attention was fixed on election maps and poling - place results , were brought about by a series of events primed by a @entity198 request filed by @entity199 , the center - right watchdog group famous for wringing incriminating paperwork out of secretive bureaucracies			1
the @entity202 first reported on the @entity0 email criticizing rep. @entity6			0
after the @entity12 refused to comply with the @entity198 request , a federal judge ordered the government to release a ' @entity208 , ' a specialized inventory of all the documents it was withholding coupled with a rationale for each			2
many of those reasons seemed specious to the judge , who then ordered a similar disclosure to @entity6 's committee			1
@entity219 ? then - deputy attorney general @entity101 was @entity0 's point man on the ' gun - walking ' debacle the @entity12 , which has not commented on the @entity56 document dump , chose to voluntarily release everything on tuesday rather than face a judge 's order to do it on a slow news day			1
the flood of documents that reached @entity48 , the @entity14 claimed in a press release , ' is an admission that the @entity12 never had legitimate grounds to withhold these documents in the first place			2
' ' approximately two - thirds of the universe of documents that the @entity12 withheld from @entity237 has now been shown to be well outside the scope of @entity239			0
' @entity6 said in a statement that ' [ w ] hen @entity0 wants to know why he was the first attorney general held in criminal contempt of @entity237 , he can read the judge ’s order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and president @entity28 illegitimately and illegally withheld from @entity237			1
' @entity0 tendered his resignation in late september but will stay on until the @entity248 can pick a successor who passes muster in the @entity251			0
@entity0 snarks about @entity6 uploaded by @entity252			0

attorney general told close aides that the @entity3 ' chief congressional *bloodhound* was playing politics with gun deaths his own @entity12 caused
' [ @entity6 ] @entity6 and his idiot cronies never gave a damn about this when all that was happening was that thousands of @entity26 were being killed with guns from our country , ' he fumed in 2011
@entity6 's committee has *aggressively* investigated a government scheme to track guns to @entity26 drug cartels by asking firearms dealers to sell them illegally to ' straw ' purchasers in large numbers
after years of *stonewalling* , the @entity12 released more than 64,000 documents sought through @entity280 – all as news media were focused on @entity56
