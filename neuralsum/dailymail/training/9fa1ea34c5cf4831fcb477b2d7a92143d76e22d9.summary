by @entity0 tracking down the name of captain @entity2 on the @entity3 takes some time			1
there are more than 20,000 names on the @entity8 stone memorial , kept in immaculate condition by gardeners from the @entity11			2
today , the @entity11 ’s stonemasons are replacing a worn panel with a newly - inscribed , pristine one			2
and there are thousands more gravestones in other cemeteries in this mining area , just outside @entity18 in north - eastern @entity19			1
poor @entity2 was one of the last of them , killed on the final day of the @entity29 - a military tragedy , with all those lives lost in exchange for a mere two miles of blood - soaked earth gained			1
@entity2 was my great - great uncle			1
i share him with my second cousin , @entity22			1
the battle he fought in at @entity3 marks the first time the @entity40 used poison gas			2
once released , it was blown back by the winds over friendly lines and killed many @entity27 soldiers			2
hero in the family : @entity2 was one of the 59,000 @entity27 dead at the @entity29 in 1915 the supposed ‘ @entity54 ’ failed at @entity29 and it led to sir @entity50 , commander of the @entity51 , being replaced by @entity53 @entity52			1
even with the sun blazing down on the memorial , your mind is drawn back to the freezing gloom and bloody slaughter of @entity61 ‘ seeing the memorial to a relation helps to bring it all home and make the connections , ’ says the prime minister , who is on his third trip to the @entity64 in a year			2
in december , he visited the memorial to another great - great uncle , @entity71 , who died at @entity72 in april 1915			1
five members of @entity22 ’s family were killed in the war			1
‘ it helps to put you in their shoes at their age at their time , ’ he explains			2
‘ i find it very moving			2
‘ the commemorations have brought it even closer			0
but there ’s something about the @entity61			0
' there ’s some extra factor which makes it incredibly powerful			0
there was the scale of the slaughter of course			0
it ’s the inexplicable nature - that the slaughter just went on and on			2
you ca n’t get away from it			0
’ early yesterday , @entity22 attended the @entity100 service at @entity101 with the @entity102			1
he was given a poppy which he laid , alongside a cross , in the earth beneath his great - great uncle ’s name at the @entity3 later in the day			1
i placed another cross next to it			0
@entity2 ’s body was never recovered - so there is no tombstone to him			1
' just war ' : mr @entity22 insisted that the soldiers who died in the @entity61 were fighting for good reason ‘ men like @entity2 went to fight because they believed they were going to fight a just war , ’ says @entity22 , ‘ they were right to think that			1
’ although @entity22 was born more than half a century after the death of @entity2 , he has strong links to him			1
@entity2 , the son of the @entity123 mp for @entity124 , was brought up at @entity125 , @entity126 , where @entity22 ’s mother , @entity127 , was later brought up			1
as a boy , @entity22 went to services in @entity130 , where his parents married and his grandfather , sir @entity133 , a @entity135 veteran , is buried			1
‘ my grandfather never talked about the @entity61 or the @entity138 , ’ says the prime minister , ‘ but i remember at his funeral [ in 1993 ] , when people came in uniform from miles away			0
this year , going to the @entity144 beaches made me think a lot about my grandfather			0
walking the graves : mr @entity22 has more relatives who fought in the wars , including a great - great uncle who fell at @entity72 and his d - day veteran grandfather ‘ he taught me how to fish and all sorts of things about the countryside			1
but he never talked about the war			0
my mother said he never would			0
he was wounded on @entity144 and he never talked about it again			0
it was classic @entity161 reserve			0
‘ that ’s one of the reasons i ’ve wanted to rediscover these connections with @entity2 - because my grandfather never talked about it			1
’ @entity2 was one of the older soldiers at the @entity64			1
he was 43 with a wife and two young sons			2
he was commissioned in the 5th battalion of the @entity170 , an infantry regiment , and arrived with his battalion at the end of may 1915 at @entity173			0
once at @entity3 , @entity174 survived the first days of the battle			0
he survived the tragic moment when the @entity40 gassed themselves			0
he survived the day the @entity161 advanced in open country into the raking fire of @entity28 machine - guns : a single @entity28 machine - gun fired 12,500 rounds that day			2
but he did not survive that fatal last day of the @entity29 - october 13 , 1915			1
in that final , desperate , @entity27 attempt to topple the @entity28 , @entity2 was killed			1
‘ despite the horror of his death , and millions more , i do not believe the @entity61 was just pointless slaughter , ’ says @entity22			1
‘ there was a purpose			0
‘ there were ways the war could have been shortened , or should have been pursued differently			0
' but the fundamental reason why @entity161 went to war in 1914 was that there was a just cause			0
we had promised to guarantee @entity196 neutrality			0
‘ it ’s right to celebrate the bravery			0
’ @entity22 still sees echoes of the war running through modern politics			1
‘ there is a right for a small country not to be bullied when it ’s overrun by its neighbours , ’ says @entity22 , ‘ in the case of the war , it was @entity196 ; but , in our own times , you can make that argument about @entity211 , @entity212			1
it still has a relevance - the territorial inviolability of states			2
’ ‘ the seminal event of our lifetime was the fall of the @entity219 or the collapse of the @entity221			0
but you need to go back to @entity61 to see how the break - up of these empires started to affect the world in which we now live			2
’ poignant : yesterday mr @entity22 joined members of the royal family including @entity229 and @entity133 and the @entity230 , seen above , at a memorial service in @entity196 @entity22 sees nothing jingoistic in commemorating the heroism of @entity174 and millions more like him			1
‘ we ’re a very patriotic , proud nation			0
we want these things to be properly commemorated			0
we have to mark the key moments in the war , too - the @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242			2
’ just before he spoke these words , @entity22 passed the memorial to another captain killed at @entity29 on the same day as captain mount - @entity246 , a 20 - year - old war poet , shot in the head by a sniper			1
after his death , his final poem was unearthed in his kit bag : ‘ when you see millions of the mouthless dead / across your dreams in pale battalions go / say not soft things as other men have said / that you ’ll remember			0
for you need not so			0
’ with all due respect to the noble poet captain , we need to remember			0

@entity2 was 43 when he was killed at the @entity29 in @entity19
mr @entity22 and @entity0 share the soldier as a great - uncle
yesterday visited a memorial on the *battlefield* and spoke of remembrance
mr @entity22 said @entity2 and those like him died for a just cause
