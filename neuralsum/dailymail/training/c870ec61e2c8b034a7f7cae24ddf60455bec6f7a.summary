by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 04:22 est , 20 november 2013 warning : planning minister @entity1 warned the @entity2 will struggle to win without wooing voters who feel unable to vote @entity4 at present one of @entity6 ’s closest allies has admitted the @entity2 are unable to win votes outside the @entity8 and among young people because they are still seen as the ‘ party of the rich ’			1
@entity1 said some of the electorate like the party ’s policies ‘ but they do n’t trust our motives ’ , and that a way had to be found to convince these voters that @entity4 ‘ are not aliens from another planet ’			1
in an attack on the @entity23 , the planning minister admitted mr @entity6 ’s attempts to detoxify the @entity2 ’ image have failed after eight years at the helm			1
he said the prime minister should ‘ shout from the rooftops ’ about liberal policies such as gay marriage if he wants to win the next election			0
he even called for the creation of a new @entity33 to attract under - 25s and suggested @entity23 mps could run on joint tickets to boost support			1
mr @entity1 was one of the first @entity2 to encourage @entity6 to change his party ’s image when he became leader in 2005			1
but speaking at the @entity23 think tank yesterday he admitted the old caricature of the conservatives as the party of the better off has not changed			0
he said : ‘ the single biggest factor preventing people voting conservative is the perception that we are the party of the rich			0
we have not done enough to reassure people about our motives			0
’ mr @entity1 conceded that the @entity2 will struggle to win a majority because ‘ a significant number of people will not even contemplate voting conservative ’			1
he argues young voters will only back the @entity2 if the party campaigns on socially liberal policies including allowing gay marriage			2
‘ we should not shy away from those achievements but shout them from the rooftops , ’ mr @entity1 said			2
‘ they should make us proud			0
having taken the pain , not to be proud of them is completely pointless			0
trouble : @entity6 , pictured in @entity67 this morning , rejected the idea of a new party mr @entity1 went on : ‘ this new group of voters represents a fantastic opportunity for our party			1
but we have no hope of securing their support if we approach them with the same proposition that we use to woo our stalwart supporters			0
’ mr @entity1 said that failing to understand that will lead to the party ‘ being pushed back into rural and suburban redoubt in the south of @entity85 ’			2
his intervention comes after sir @entity87 said it was ‘ truly shocking ’ that a public school elite still runs @entity89 – comments widely interpreted as a reference to figures such as mr @entity1 who went to public school @entity93 before @entity95			2
the former prime minister also warned @entity4 that pursuing a ‘ core vote ’ strategy would deliver the @entity2 ‘ the wooden spoon ’ on 2015			2
coalition : mr @entity1 noted that @entity101 , pictured , stood as a national liberal before the party formally merged with the conservatives in the 1960s mr @entity1 once argued for a longstanding coalition between @entity2 and @entity107			1
but he said : ‘ i did not realise that our coalition partners would do everything in their power to paint us as heartless extremists			1
and i underestimated the readiness of some in the conservative party , and the press , to play up to the caricature and thereby fall squarely into their trap			0
’ mr @entity1 said the @entity2 should reform the @entity33 , a ticket on which @entity101 once stood in the 1950s , just as some @entity120 are simultaneously members of the co-op party			1
but the idea was rejected by @entity23 high command			0
a @entity67 source said : ‘ this is not supported by @entity126			0
it is not going to happen			0

planning minister @entity1 calls for a revival of @entity33
joint - ticket *candidates* could woo voters from the @entity107
warns @entity107 in coalition have cast @entity2 as ' heartless extremists '
but @entity126 *quickly* rejects idea : ' it is not going to happen '
