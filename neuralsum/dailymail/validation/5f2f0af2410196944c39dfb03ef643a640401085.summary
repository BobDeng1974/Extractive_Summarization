@entity0 is to delay publishing its manifesto for as long as possible , party leader @entity3 revealed today			1
the party ’s detailed pitch to voters had been expected to be set out at its spring conference in @entity8 this weekend			2
but mr @entity3 today insisted he wants to release it as ‘ late as practicably possible ’ in the election campaign , which would give voters less time to challenge the party on its contents			2
it included pledges to improve @entity24 by painting trains in traditional colours , deploying soldiers on the street and enforcing a dress code for taxi drivers and theatregoers			1
since then , the party has enjoyed a surge in support , topping the polls in the @entity37 elections and securing two elected mps who defected from the @entity39			0
as a result , @entity0 has faced closer scrutiny of its policies , with splits emerging over key areas of tax , spending and social policy			2
now it has emerged mr @entity3 plans to keep the party ’s policy pitch to voters secret for as long as he can			2
he told @entity54 ’s @entity53 : ‘ my view on our release of the manifesto is we should do it as late as practicably possible because i think by then people will want to see something fresh , new and positive			2
’ bizarrely , he said he did not want to release his manifesto yet because the ‘ general election campaign has already gone on for far too long as far as most of the public are concerned ’			0
he added : ‘ people are getting bored to death			0
every day there are all sorts of pronouncements being made by @entity68 and the @entity69 to appease all sorts of special interest groups			0
i think most of what ’s being said is already going in one ear and out of the other			0
’ @entity75 was been replaced as the @entity0 policy chief after failing to complete the party 's manifesto in time			1
@entity0 's deputy chairman @entity0 was put in charge of the manifesto process , with the final document to be unveiled in @entity8 this weekend @entity3 has disowned the whole of the 2010 @entity0 manifesto , despite writing its foreword			1
some of the more eye - catching policies in @entity0 's 2010 manifesto include : @entity37 is due to be dissolved on march 30 , with the general election held on may 7			1

@entity0 's deputy chairman @entity0 was put in charge of the manifesto process , with the final document to be unveiled in @entity8 this weekend			1
asked why it was not published , mr @entity3 said today : ‘ no , no. that was never , ever said			0
the idea we would publish a manifesto so long before a general election			0
’ but miss @entity0 made clear in january : ‘ ' i relish the task of putting together the final details and presenting a sensible , radical and fully costed manifesto at our spring conference in @entity8			1
' mr @entity3 has previously insisted all of the party ’s manifesto will have been full costed , but suggested voting @entity0 is about ‘ a state of mind ’ rather than detailed policies			1
however , policy splits have emerged			0
mr @entity3 sparked controversy by claiming that privatising large parts of the @entity110 was ' a debate that we 're all going to have to return to ' if the health service was going to stay affordable			0
but @entity0 's health spokesman , @entity114 , insisted her leader was out of touch with the public when it came to the @entity110			2
she insisted the party ’s policy on the @entity110 would contain ‘ not a whiff ’ of privatisation			0

@entity0 leader *over-rules* manifesto chief who said it would be public by now
@entity0 said manifesto would be *launched* at conference in @entity8
farage backs delay so policies will seem ' fresh , new and positive '
but it will mean voters have less time to scrutinise the details of policies
2010 manifesto *ditched* as ' drivel ' , despite @entity3 writing its foreword
included *uniforms* for taxi drivers and painting trains in traditional colours
