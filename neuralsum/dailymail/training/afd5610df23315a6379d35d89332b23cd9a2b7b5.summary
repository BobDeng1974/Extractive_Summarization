inspired by watching @entity1 lift the @entity2 and the simple need to make ends meet , @entity0 carved himself a small piece of @entity7 tennis history on friday			1
having arrived a day late in @entity8 to attend @entity9 and see one drought broken , he managed to do something similar – becoming the first @entity7 man in 41 years to qualify for the @entity13			1
the @entity16 cabbie ’s son scored one of his best career victories – and a minimum payday of £ 20,000 – by coming back to beat highly - rated former @entity21 college champion @entity20 4 - 6 6 - 4 12 - 10 in a shade over three hours			1
while @entity0 has to wait and see who he plays @entity42 was given a middling sort of draw , facing @entity48 ’s world number 55 @entity46 in the first round with a possible quarter final against @entity52 champion @entity51			1
@entity7 number three @entity0 will probably be gone by then , but yesterday was a reminder of the stirring @entity56 performances for which he is best known			1
an avid @entity57 , his three - match run into the main draw had unpromising beginnings when his passion for @entity1 got the better of his professional instincts			1
he not only got to watch the final but met up with a few of the players afterwards before catching the train to @entity8			1
' i probably should have been in @entity8 preparing early but i could n’t say no to @entity1 ' , he said			1
' to be honest , at 2 - 0 down after 10 minutes , i was thinking : ‘ everyone who knows i am at this game is going to absolutely slaughter me			0
’ ' my coach probably was n’t too happy with me but he knows that i am mad about @entity1 , so he let it go			2
even though he ’s an @entity72 , he realised that we have n’t been in too many finals lately			0
ending the drought : @entity0 emulated @entity76 by breaking a long - standing duck this week hopeful : @entity32 could join @entity0 and @entity42 in the @entity80 open if she wins her final qualifier 1st round @entity82 ( @entity48 ) 2nd round @entity84 ( @entity86 ) 3rd round @entity87 ( @entity89 ) 4th round @entity90 ( @entity92 ) @entity93 : @entity51 ( @entity94 ) @entity95 ; @entity96 ( @entity97 ) @entity98 ( @entity99 ) ' someone said to me earlier on today : ‘ fight like the @entity1			1
’ and i thought : ‘ why not ? ’ and it worked for me today			0
' in emulating @entity103 from 1973 and wiping out another awkward statistic for @entity7 tennis he needed to save two match points at 6 - 7 in the decider against a player ranked 76 places above him at 94			2
having failed to serve it out at 5 - 4 in the third @entity0 showed impressive nerve to hang on , but then the money is a massive incentive for someone in his position			2
' it ’s very difficult at the 100 - 250 ranking to make a living really , ' he said			0
' it ’s very difficult because there ’s my expenses , my coach ’s , food , the hotel , your travel , for the two people and if you lose first round ( at @entity131 ) you ’re getting $ 300 , minus tax , it ’s embarrassing , really			0
' there should n’t be such a massive gap to the guy who ca n’t even get a transport leaving here , because he ’s lost in first round qualies , it ’s embarrassing			0
even in the past , at the @entity140 you get refused entry the day after you lose			0
' when you ’re in the top 200 players in the world and you have to get somebody to pick up your laundry because you left it in there the day before			0
those are the sorts of things that need to change			0
' @entity42 seemed reasonably unfazed about his draw , although is aware of the danger @entity151 presents			2
ready to go : @entity42 , practicing today before the @entity41 , will play in @entity8 without a coach tough draw : @entity42 is aware of the threat posed by @entity46 ( above ) , his first round opponent ' he plays exciting tennis , goes for his shots , and when he ’s on he makes it very difficult			1
his form has been inconsistent because of his game style but he beat @entity51 in the @entity56 this year , he ’s got a big forehand and does n’t hold back			2
' @entity42 claimed again that he is getting closer to appointing a new coach , although a few of his signs are contradictory on this			2
' i would n’t expect anything in the next few days but i ’m closer than i was in @entity168 last week			0
it ’s not about rushing			0
' it was not all joy for the @entity172 yesterday , with @entity173 losing in the final round of women ’s qualifying 6 - 7 7 - 5 6 - 0 to @entity177 and @entity178 going out of the second round of the men ’s event 6 - 3 7 - 6 to @entity176			1
@entity42 ’s theoretical route : 1st @entity82 2nd @entity84 ( @entity86 ) 3rd @entity87 ( @entity89 ) 4th @entity90 ( @entity92 ) @entity93 : @entity51 ( @entity94 ) @entity95 ; @entity96 ( @entity183 ) @entity98 ( @entity99 )			0

@entity7 number three fights back from a set down to beat @entity20
@entity0 said he was inspired by @entity1 's @entity2 *fightback*
