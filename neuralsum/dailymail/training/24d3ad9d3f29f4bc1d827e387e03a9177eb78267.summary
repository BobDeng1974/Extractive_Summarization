many people have claimed that reading a special book has transformed their life , but now scientists have discovered that enjoying a novel can make a real , measurable change in the brain too			1
@entity8 researchers used @entity10 scanners to identify brain networks associated with reading stories and found that changes in the brain linger for a few days after reading a powerful work of fiction			1
they set out to unravel the mystery of how stories ‘ get into ’ the brain and find the lingering effects of literature			2
scientists from @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity24 , said reading a novel can cause changes in the ' resting - state connectivity ' of the brain , which can last for days			1
they set out to unravel the mystery of how stories ' get into ' the brain and find the lingering effects of literature scientists from @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity24 , said reading a novel can cause changes in the ‘ resting - state ’ of the brain , which can last for days			1
‘ stories shape our lives and in some cases help define a person , ’ said @entity36 , lead author of the study and director of the university ’s @entity39			1
‘ we want to understand how stories get into your brain and what they do to it , ’ he said			2
the study , published in the journal @entity52 , was based on research using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity10 ) to look at the brain networks involved with the reading of stories			1
a total of 12 students participated in the experiment and read nine sections of @entity63 ' novel , @entity64 a total of 12 students participated in the experiment , which was conducted over 19 consecutive days and saw them reading the same novel – @entity64 , a thriller by @entity63 , which is based on the eruption of @entity72 in ancient @entity73			0
the novel was selected for its page - turning narrative , which centres on the protagonist outside @entity64 , who sees signs of the eruption and struggles to get back to the city to save the woman he loves			0
professor @entity36 said : ‘ it was important to us that the book had a strong narrative line			0
’ while most previous studies have focused on the cognitive processes involved while people are reading stories in an @entity10 scanner , this study was primarily concerned with the after effects of reading			1
students ’ brains were scanned in a resting state each morning for the first five days of the experiment			0
they were then given nine sections of the book over nine days and asked to read each 30 page section every evening			0
they then came into the lab the next morning to undergo an @entity10 scan in a non-reading state - after answering a quiz to ensure they really had read the section			2
after completing all nine sections of the novel , the participants were scanned over five more mornings in a resting state			0
the results showed heightened connectivity in the left temporal cortex - an area of the brain which is associated with receptivity for language - on the mornings following the reading assignments			1
‘ even though the participants were not actually reading the novel while they were in the scanner , they retained this heightened connectivity , ’ professor @entity36 said			1
‘ we call that a “ shadow activity , ” almost like a muscle memory , ’ he added			0
heightened connectivity was also seen in the central sulcus , which is the primary sensory motor region of the brain			1
the scientists used an fmri scans ( similar to those pictured ) to find that neural changes created by reading the novel were associated with physical sensation and movement systems - suggesting that reading a work of fiction can transport a person into the body of the protagonist neurons of this region have been associated with creating sensations for the body , so that just thinking about running , for example , can activate the neurons associated with the physical act of running			1
‘ the neural changes that we found , associated with physical sensation and movement systems , suggest that reading a novel can transport you into the body of the protagonist , ’ professor @entity36 said			1
‘ we already knew that good stories can put you in someone else ’s shoes in a figurative sense			0
now we ’re seeing that something may also be happening biologically			0
’ he claims that the neural changes are not immediate reactions as they linger five days after the participants completed the novel			0
professor @entity36 said : ‘ it remains an open question how long these neural changes might last			0
’ ‘ but the fact that we ’re detecting them over a few days for a randomly assigned novel suggests that your favorite novels could certainly have a bigger and longer - lasting effect on the biology of your brain			2
’ reading @entity179 novels closely activates the areas of the brain more commonly associated with movement and touch , according to a previous study by @entity8 researchers			1
the findings surprised neuroscientists who expected to see changes in regions of the brain , which regulate attention as the main differences between casual and focused reading			2
but the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity10 ) scans looked as they would if readers were physically placing themselves within the story as they analysed it			2
test subjects were asked to read in two ways : sometimes they were asked to casually browse the text , as they might do in a bookshop ; other times they were asked to delve deep , as a scholar might study a text			0
@entity208 , professor of @entity209 at @entity210 , who led the study , said : ' what 's been taking us by surprise in our early data analysis is how much the whole brain - global activations across a number of different regions - seems to be transforming and shifting between the pleasure and the close reading			1
' as volunteers read , professor @entity222 and her team scanned their brains while simultaneously tracking their eye movements , breathing and heart rate			0
unexpectedly they found that close reading activated parts of the brain usually more involved in movement and touch - as though readers were physically placing themselves in the story			2
the research fits into a new interdisciplinary field sometimes called literary neuroscience			0
other researchers are looking at how poetry and rhythm affect the brain as well as how metaphors excite sensory regions			2
their research hopes to reveal a more complete picture of the mysteries of human cognition and is an important crossing point between the arts and the sciences .			0

researchers from @entity23 in @entity24 used @entity10 scanners to identify brain networks associated with reading stories
the study showed heightened connectivity in an area of the brain associated with understanding language after the reading of a novel
it suggests reading a novel can transport a person into the body of a book 's protagonist as neural changes are linked with movement systems
