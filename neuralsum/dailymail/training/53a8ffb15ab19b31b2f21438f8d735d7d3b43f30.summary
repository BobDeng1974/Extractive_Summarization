@entity0 has emerged from the @entity1 with renewed self - belief and a resolve to re-dedicate himself to the sport after a lost period when he freely admits he was a sports psychologist ’s worst nightmare			1
it has long been a mystery why someone so good under pressure and on and around the greens should frequently talk himself down			2
@entity0 was at it again at @entity12			1
when asked about the possibility of partnering @entity14 , he told an amusing but bewildering story about how he would watch his fellow @entity16 drive the ball 350 yards at @entity18 in 2012 and ask himself : is it worth me bothering to tee it up ? @entity0 punches the air as he beats @entity23 at the @entity24 @entity0 says he 's emerged from a period in which he was a sports psychologist ’s worst nightmare well , maybe not if there was nothing else to the game			1
but thankfully , some good people around him , including caddy @entity33 and coach @entity34 , have finally got through regarding the qualities @entity0 does have rather than those he does not			1
‘ i have definitely been getting sucked in playing with these big hitters and beating myself up about it , ’ revealed @entity42 ‘ playing with @entity14 , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , i ’ve been thinking : “ wow , i ca n’t compete			1
” ' now i am refocusing on what i do have , because i do have the tools to compete			0
i need to be more like @entity46 and stop being obsessed by negatives			0
my team around me have given me a good dose of reality in telling me how good a player i am			0
’ @entity53 ’s @entity1 captain @entity52 did a good job , too , when he gave @entity0 the honour of leading the team out in the singles			1
it ’s a symptom of how negative @entity0 had become that his first thought was to ask himself whether he was up to the task			1
‘ it did take me aback at first when he asked me , ’ admitted the 35 year old			2
‘ he said i want you to lead us because you ’re a battler and a fighter and i thought : " oh yeah , i ’m a battler and a fighter			2
” ' i ’ d forgotten that about myself			0
' i thought i was just a guy who hit it 275 yards from the tee and could only compete on short courses			0
i ’d forgotten i had a lot of other qualities that made me the player i was			0
i guess that ’s why we pay these fortunes to sports psychologists to get these thoughts out of our heads			0
@entity42 's caddy @entity33 ( right ) was among those who have helped him appreciate his talents again @entity0 putts on first green on wednesday at the @entity86 in @entity87 @entity0 now knows that while he does n't have the heavy machinery at the disposal of @entity14 or @entity41 that made him wonder whether he could compete or not , his other virtues make him a threat on tour @entity0 finishes off the 16th hole at the @entity94 in @entity87 ‘ so i ’m using this end of season run to refocus for next year and really commit myself to the game again			1
i lost focus for the last year for all the right reasons , with getting married and having our first child			0
they are special times in the life of anyone			0
' but now that ’s all stabilised , and i realise how lucky i am to be playing out here			0
i ’m in the prime of my career and i want to give the next five to eight years absolutely everything i have			0
’ given his prowess at the format , where better to start than at the @entity112 at the @entity113 on wednesday ? there were shades of @entity12 with him out first and up against one of the game ’s gifted young talents but , like @entity119 on that earlier occasion @entity121 @entity23 was despatched , by a three and two scoreline			1
elsewhere , much of the attention centred around @entity125 @entity124 , who discovered that not only are the @entity53 a tough nut to crack at the @entity1 but there ’s plenty more who are tough cookies as well			1
@entity124 was up against @entity130 @entity129 , who did what no @entity53 was able to do at @entity12 , as he defeated the brash @entity132 two and one			2
just like the @entity1 ( above ) , @entity0 was first up in @entity87 on wednesday and beat @entity23 3 & 2 @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity135 ( right ) embrace as they walk up the 18th in @entity53 's @entity1 win @entity0 proudly holds a personalised @entity138 flag with countryman and @entity140 1 @entity14 @entity0 smiles on his way to victory on wednesday as his new lease on life shows on the course swede @entity129 did what no @entity53 could do to @entity124 at @entity12 and beat him in @entity87 @entity124 will now have to win his next two matches against @entity148 on thursday and @entity149 on friday if his first visit to the @entity152 area is not to end with him spending the weekend as just another @entity125 tourist			1
as for the man who won the winning point at the @entity1 , @entity149 was rather brought down to earth by the only @entity157 in the field , as @entity148 won two and one			2
there were also wins for @entity162 against @entity163 , and @entity164 over @entity166 @entity165 .			0

@entity0 beat @entity23 in @entity24
the @entity16 is revived after the @entity1 with great self - belief
@entity42 admitted to *doubting* his worth *alongside* big - hitters of the game
caddy @entity33 and coach @entity34 *convinced* him of his quality
@entity53 @entity1 captain @entity52 gave @entity0 a boost in *chosing* him to lead off for the *continent* in the singles because he was a ' fighter '
