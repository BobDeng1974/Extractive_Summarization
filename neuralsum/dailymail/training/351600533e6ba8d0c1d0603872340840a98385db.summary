there is no hiding from the impact that @entity3 made at @entity4			1
@entity5 , banging the @entity7 drum last week , suggested his departure would not hurt the organisation of which he is chief executive			1
but at @entity4 , even three bites down the line , they view things rather differently			1
‘ he was a wonderful talent and a wonderful player , ’ said @entity14			1
‘ i ’m sure most of the @entity7 will miss him			1
’ for @entity14 , last season was the fairytale without the happy ending			1
no one in the modern era of the @entity7 has risen from seventh to second without a huge cash injection from a benefactor			2
now though , as they take on @entity45 at @entity32 on sunday , they must do it all again and this time without one of the world ’s great players			1
@entity14 must strike a balance : being appreciative of what @entity3 did for the club while not letting the new group of players obsess on his departure			1
‘ we gave him everything in support , ’ said @entity14			2
the @entity4 manager was watching @entity63 v @entity61 when news came through of the latest biting incident of his star player , though by then the wheels were already in motion from @entity3 ’s side for the move to @entity25			1
‘ @entity3 was a great servant for us in the period he was here			2
we propelled him from a player some people had never heard of when he came into a world - class player			2
in the last two seasons in particular his game has been phenomenal			0
as a club , a city and as supporters we could n’t have done any more			0
it was time for both to part and we will continue to grow and get stronger			0
happy times : @entity3 celebrates his second goal against @entity86 during @entity4 's 3 - 2 win last year in sync : @entity3 had a positive effect on those around him at @entity32 , including strike partner @entity91 ‘ he would get a great reception [ if he came back ]			1
every time he stepped on to the pitch he gave his life to the team			0
i can never forget his training			2
you talk about top players helping develop the younger players and i see the attitude of some of our younger players because they ’ve worked with the likes of @entity3 and @entity33 , who give 150 per cent every single day			1
’ it puts you in mind of @entity28 , another iconic player who left @entity112 football prematurely but whose influence continued at @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 , all of whom cite the @entity124 ’s attitude to training as a key influence in their careers			1
perhaps @entity3 can do the same for @entity4			1
‘ yes , i think he will do , ’ said @entity14			2
‘ look at players who were close to him , like young [ @entity132 ] @entity131 , and i know he ’s learned from him			1
he wants to be out training every day			2
never misses a day , tries to be better every day , looks after himself			0
i know @entity3 was a big influence on him			2
’ similar impacts : @entity14 says he hopes @entity3 's ability will inspire @entity4 's current crop , just like @entity28 did when he joined @entity114 and then left the club prematurely mercurial talent : @entity28 strides a challenge from @entity142 defender @entity141 during his time at @entity114 role model : @entity28 's approach to training inspired a generation of players at @entity149 including @entity115 there are others who can pick up the mantle			1
@entity4 , who completed the signing of @entity156 ’s £ 12million defender @entity155 yesterday , have spent about £ 100m on eight players this summer — three of them from @entity45 , making today something of an old boys ’ reunion			1
@entity14 though dismisses the obvious comparison with @entity163 last season , who sold @entity165 and signed a similar number of replacements , unsuccessfully			1
‘ it ’s totally different , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve gone into the @entity170 for the first time since 2009			0
we had a terrific season but the depth of our squad was frighteningly shallow			2
so we needed to improve the quality but the net spend is very small			0
it was part of the vision and strategy of the club in terms of what we were trying to do			0
‘ it ’s not as if we ’re bringing them straight into the team			0
we ’ve still got our core			0
it ’s not a new team , it ’s an evolving team			0
it ’s a totally different scenario			0
we are clear in our identity of how we play and how we work			0
‘ we ’ve done some great work over the past year in terms of planning for this moment			0
we knew that this was a big summer for us and if you look at the age group of the players , this will probably be the biggest window that we may have for a few seasons			2
but we knew that we needed it — it was too late to do it in january			0
’ after the @entity206 , there is a theory that players from less - exalted football countries have to keep working harder for longer to make the grade and @entity14 agrees			1
‘ we do n’t have that here			0
you ’re part of the most brilliant league in the world , the most competitive league in the world			0
’ he added : ‘ we want to be winners , we know that we ’re on the way to challenging , which is the most important thing for us			0

@entity7 chief executive said @entity3 's move would not hurt league
@entity14 described @entity224 as ' a wonderful talent and wonderful player '
@entity4 came so close to winning the league last season and despite @entity3 's departure @entity14 thinks his talent can inspire current crop
the 41 - year - old likened @entity3 's impact at @entity32 to @entity28 's role at @entity114
@entity14 says *playmaker* @entity131 in particular has benefited from playing and training with the @entity25 *forward*
@entity4 have spent £ 100m on eight players this summer to replace @entity3
