astronomers have calculated the origin of a meteor that injured 1,000 people after breaking up over central @entity4			1
they used amateur video footage to plot the path of the space rock that burned up over the city of @entity9 causing shockwaves that blew out windows			1
the results suggest the meteor belongs to a well known family of space rocks known as the @entity17 asteroids , and probably came from an asteroid belt between @entity19 and @entity20			1
the orbits of @entity26 and @entity19 are shown , although the calculations included the rest of inner and outer planets			0
dozens of videos of the fireball were taken with camera phones , cctv and car - dashboard cameras and put online , and the team found two in particular that helped then worked out exactly where it came from			2
using this amateur video footage , they were able to plot the meteor 's trajectory through @entity26 's atmosphere and then reconstruct its orbit around the @entity25 ' using evidence gathered by one camera at the @entity48 in the city of @entity9 and other videos recorded by witnesses in the close city of @entity53 , we calculate the trajectory of the body in the atmosphere and use it to reconstruct the orbit in space of the meteoroid previous to the violent encounter with our planet , ' said @entity63 and @entity64 , from the @entity65 in @entity66			1
experts said the meteor that left a 50 - foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of @entity9 , in the @entity72 , weighed around 100,000 tonnes and measured 55 feet in diameter ' we use it to classify the meteoroid among the near @entity26 asteroid families Ô¨Ånding that the parent body belonged to the @entity17 asteroids			1
' using the footage and the location of an impact into @entity83 , the team calculated the height , speed and position of the rock as it fell to @entity26			2
they estimate that it was travelling between 13km/s and 19km/s , brightening up above @entity92 when it was between 32km and 47km high			0
early estimates of the meteor 's mass put it at ten tonnes ; @entity99 space agency @entity98 later estimated it to be between 7,000 and 10,000 tonnes			1
@entity98 estimates the size of the object was about 17m ( 55ft )			0
the reconstruction uses three vantage points : the @entity48 at @entity9 ( c ) , the @entity106 metropolitan area ( @entity107 ) and @entity83 ( @entity108 )			0
the brightening point ( @entity110 ) and the fragmentation point ( @entity112 ) are the points of the trajectory seen from @entity9 and measured using the shadow cast by the poles at the @entity117			2
' in february 15 2013 a medium - sized meteoroid impacted the atmosphere in the region @entity122 , @entity4 , ' the team wrote			2
' after its entrance to the atmosphere and after travel by several hundred of kilometers the body exploded in a powerful event responsible for physical damages and injured people spread over a region enclosing several large cities			0
' we present in this letter the results of a preliminary reconstruction of the orbit of the @entity9 meteoroid			2
' once they had discovered its trajectory , the researchers put their figures into astronomy software developed by the @entity143			0
the results suggest the meteor belongs to a well known family of space rocks known as @entity17			1
of about 9,700 near - @entity26 asteroids discovered so far , about 5,200 are thought to be @entity149			0
the @entity17 asteroids are a class of asteroids with @entity26 - crossing orbits			1
the first @entity17 asteroid was discovered in 1918 by @entity155 observing from @entity156 , @entity157 friction : burning from the friction with @entity26 's thin air , the space rock exploded 14.5 miles above the @entity4 town of @entity9 asteroids are divided into different groups such as @entity17 , @entity165 , or @entity166 , based on the type of orbit they have			1
dr @entity170 , from the @entity171 , said the team had done well to publish so quickly			0
' it certainly looks like it was a member of the @entity17 class of asteroids , ' he told @entity176			1
' its elliptical , low inclination orbit , indicates a solar system origin , most likely from the asteroid belt between @entity19 and @entity20			0
' perhaps with more data , we can determine roughly where in the asteroid belt it come from			0
' stunning : a montage of all the images taken by @entity186 of the meteorite as it hurtled over the @entity4 sky			0

team used video of the meteor to calculate its trajectory
results suggest the meteor belongs to a well known family of space rocks known as the @entity17 asteroids
