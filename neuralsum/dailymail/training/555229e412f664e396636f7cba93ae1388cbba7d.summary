he also told police a ' pack of lies ' to try to pin it on her estranged spouse and son , claiming they had hired a hitman to kill her			1
but now the 49 - year - old has been found guilty of her murder after a trial at @entity3 and sentenced to life , with a minimum of 18 years			1
judge @entity44 said : ' mrs @entity4 could not bring herself to end her marriage and to inform her husband of her relationship with you			1
' i am satisfied that it is you that decided to force the issue of bringing matters to a head , to use mrs @entity4 's phone to send texts to her husband informing him mrs @entity4 was leaving him			1
' precisely what happened when you returned home having sent that text only you will know			0
' but it may well have been the case that you informed mrs @entity4 you had sent the text , causing her distress and led to a confrontation between you			2
murdered : @entity4 , right , died brutally at the hands of her lover in november last year , and her killer then tried to pin it on her estranged husband @entity69 , left ' something happened which clearly angered you			1
' during sentencing , it was heard that @entity2 had a history of previous convictions dating back to 1979			2
these included an arson offence in 1981 , and in 1984 he was imprisoned for four years for an offence of grievous bodily harm			0
judge @entity44 added : ' there was clearly a degree of pre-meditation			0

you then strangled her to death			0
' you clearly intended to kill her			0
' you have never accepted responsibility for mrs @entity4 's death , making false alibis at trial			1
' you made a cowardly attempt during the trial to incriminate mr @entity104 senior and junior in the killing of mrs @entity4			1
' not withstanding their loss , mr @entity104 's fanily have conducted themselves with enormous dignity throughout the course of these proceedings			0
' there is only one sentence that can be imposed in your case and that is a sentence of imprisonment for life			0
' @entity2 had tried to hide his murder after leaving the crime scene and then turning up again ' in shock '			1
investigation : @entity2 tried to bamboozle police by appearing at the house in shock and later tried to pin it on @entity4 's husband and son after the fire was put out a series of love letters between @entity2 and his lover mrs @entity4 had been laid out in the living room , probably to suggest her husband had found them and then killed her			1
one note , which appeared to be from mrs @entity4 to @entity2 said : ' love you darling , from your wife xxxxxx ' , which was obviously a nickname for her lover			1
mrs @entity4 ’s badly burnt body was then found upstairs on the smouldering bed inside the locked house			1
after her killing and shortly before the body was found , @entity2 sent a message to mrs @entity4 ’s phone , which he was carrying , that said : ' hi babe , just finishing pigeons off then on way for chinese			1
@entity154 , i love you darling / @entity156 i love you sweetheart			0
xxx ' @entity2 had also been posting on @entity157 that he was ‘ in love with @entity160 ’ and announced they were going to get married			2
during the trial grieving widower @entity104 told the court he was convinced his wife was coming back to him and was simply taking time out to think while staying with a friend			0
he said he knew nothing about the affair she was having with @entity2			2
mr @entity104 told the court : ' i just felt like i just needed to give her the time she asked for			0
' she said " i will come back , give me a couple of weeks and i will come back			0
" ' i did n’t want to start pushing her incase i pushed her away			0
' i wanted to carry on with my marriage to @entity160			0
' mr @entity104 said on the day of his wife ’s death he received a text message from her phone which said ‘ @entity180 , i ’m leaving you for good			1
’ after he received the message he desperately tried to get in touch with his wife but @entity2 answered her phone			1
he then said he was ‘ tossing and turning ’ in bed that night when the police came to his door to tell him his wife was dead			2
while giving evidence during the trial @entity2 claimed mrs @entity4 had been killed by a hitman who was hired by mrs @entity4 ’s husband and son			1
he said gangsters must have turned up looking for him but strangled his lover when he was not at home			0
@entity2 told jurors : ' i ’m not saying the @entity197 were the killers , it was someone on their behalf			2
' someone went in the house that day			2
maybe not to murder her , maybe to come after me			0
' @entity2 told jurors he and mrs @entity4 had been childhood sweethearts but had gone their separate ways and both married other people			1
it was just a few months before her death they got back in touch after a chance meeting			0
prosecutors said @entity2 may have snapped and killed mrs @entity4 when she said she wanted to make a go of her marriage rather than continue seeing him			1
prosecutor @entity216 told the court : ' @entity4 was a lady who had been in a relationship with the defendant and who had been living at the address for three to four months by the time of her death			2
' we can not say whether the fire was set immediately after he killed mrs @entity4 or whether he did so later			2
' however , the prosecution submit it is clear this fire was set specifically to destroy the evidence of what had happened to mrs @entity4			1
' we say that because of the fact the fire was set on the very bed which she was lying , in the areas immediately around the body in more than one location on that bed and also because she was dead by the time the fire started			2
' the defendant and mrs @entity4 had been having an affair for some months and she had been living there			0
' it is clear he wanted mrs @entity4 to tell her husband she wanted her marriage to end and wished to marry the defendant			2
“ it may be we will never know if she shared that wish			0
' the court heard the couple had been on a romantic night away to a hotel in @entity251 just before the killing			0
but mr @entity216 said : ' something happened in that house on that morning that led to her being strangled by the defendant and the setting of this fire in an attempt to cover his tracks and to raise the idea it has been an intruder or intruders who committed these acts while he was elsewhere			0
