the number of confirmed @entity2 cases passed the 10,000 mark over the weekend , despite efforts to curb its spread			1
and while the disease typically dies on surfaces within hours , research has discovered it can survive for more than seven weeks under certain conditions			1
during tests , the @entity11 ’s @entity10 ( @entity10 ) found that the @entity14 strain will live on samples stored on glass at low temperatures for as long as 50 days			1
the left - hand charts plot survival rates of @entity14 strain of @entity2 ( @entity21 ) and @entity22 ( @entity23 ) on glass ( a ) and plastic ( b ) at 4 ° ( 39 ° f ) over 14 days			1
the right - hand charts reveal the survival rate under the same conditions over 50 days			1
both viruses survived for 26 days , and @entity2 was extracted after 50 days the tests were initially carried out by researchers from @entity10 before the current outbreak , in 2010 , but the strain investigated is one of five that is still infecting people globally			1
the findings are also quoted in advice from the @entity38 in @entity39			0
@entity2 was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the @entity42 family			2
this family includes the @entity43 ( @entity21 ) , which was first identified in 1976 and is the most virulent ; @entity44 , ( @entity45 ) ; @entity46 ; @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , and @entity48 ( @entity49 ) - the most recent species , discovered in 2008			0
for their 2010 paper , ‘ the survival of filoviruses in liquids , on solid substrates and in a dynamic aerosol ’ , the @entity11 ’s @entity10 ( @entity10 ) tested two particular filoviruses on a variety of surfaces			1
these were the @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , and @entity43 ( @entity21 )			0
each was placed into guinea pig tissue samples and tested for their ability to survive in different liquids and on different surfaces at different temperatures , over a 50 - day period			2
when stored at 4 ° ( 39 ° f ) , by day 26 , viruses from three of the samples were successfully extracted ; @entity69 on the glass sample , and @entity23 on both glass and plastic			1
by day 50 , the only sample from which the virus could be recovered was the @entity69 from tissue on glass			2
for their 2010 paper , ‘ the survival of filoviruses in liquids , on solid substrates and in a dynamic aerosol ’ , @entity77 and her colleagues tested two particular filoviruses on a variety of surfaces			1

‘ this study has demonstrated that ﬁloviruses are able to survive and remain infectious , for extended periods when suspended within liquid and dried onto surfaces , ’ explained the researchers			1
‘ data from this study extend the knowledge on the survival of filoviruses under different conditions and provide a basis with which to inform risk assessments and manage exposure			1
’ the researchers do stress that these tests were carried out in a controlled lab environment , and not in the real world , but published their findings to highlight the survival rates			2
last week the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) updated its @entity2 guidelines following the rise in infections			1
@entity2 ( pictured ) was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the @entity42 family			0
this family includes the @entity43 ( @entity21 ) , which was first identified in 1976 and is the most virulent ; @entity44 , ( @entity45 ) ; @entity46 ; @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , and @entity48 ( @entity49 ) the centre explained that @entity2 is not spread through the air , water , or food and a person infected with @entity2 ca n’t spread the disease until symptoms appear			0
the time from exposure to when signs or symptoms of the disease appear , known as the incubation period , is two to 21 days , but the average time is eight to 10 days			0
the @entity117 advises : do wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol - based hand sanitizer			2
do not touch the blood or body fluids ( like urine , feces , saliva , vomit , sweat , and semen ) of people who are sick			0
do not handle items that may have come in contact with a sick person ’s blood or body fluids , like clothes , bedding , needles , or medical equipment			0
do not touch the body of someone who has died of @entity2			0
@entity2 is spread through direct contact , through broken skin or through eyes , nose , or mouth , via blood and body fluids of a person who is sick with @entity2 , or objects , such as needles , that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with @entity2			1
signs of @entity2 include fever and symptoms like severe headache , muscle pain , vomiting , diarrhea , stomach pain , or unexplained bleeding or bruising			0
dr @entity180 of the @entity181 , who has treated victims in @entity183 and @entity184 , says : ‘ the initial symptoms are quite non-specific and similar to a flu - like illness			0
' they include fever , headache and lethargy			0
this progresses to severe diarrhoea and vomiting			0
’ officials have emphasised there is no risk of transmission from people who have been exposed to the virus , but are not yet showing symptoms			2
but , specialists at @entity201 in @entity202 found that the virus is present on a patient ’s skin after symptoms develop , underlining how contagious the disease is once symptoms set in			0
according to the @entity117 , the virus can survive for a few hours on dry surfaces like doorknobs and countertops and can survive for several days in puddles or other collections of body fluid			1
however , bleach solutions , including household bleach , can kill it			1
@entity2 is only spread through direct contact , through broken skin or through eyes , nose , or mouth , via blood and body fluids of a person who is sick with @entity2 , or objects , such as needles , that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with @entity2			1
it can be killed using bleach there is no @entity235 - approved vaccine available for @entity2 , but experimental vaccines and treatments for @entity2 are under development			1
the @entity117 advises people wash their hands with soap and water or use an alcohol - based hand sanitiser , to protect themselves			1
it warns to not touch the blood or body fluids , including urine , faeces , saliva , vomit , sweat , and semen of people who are sick			0
@entity2 was once thought to originated in gorillas , because human outbreaks began after people ate gorilla meat			2
but scientists now believe that bats are the natural reservoir for the virus , and that apes and humans catch it from eating food that bats have drooled or defecated on , or by coming in contact with surfaces covered in infected bat droppings and then touching their eyes or mouths			0
the current outbreak seems to have started in a village near @entity273 , @entity183 , where bat hunting is common , according to @entity275			0

research claims certain strains of @entity2 can remain on surfaces for 50 days
it survived the longest on glass surfaces stored at 4 ° ( 39 ° f )
@entity117 claims @entity2 typically lives on a ‘ dry ’ surface for hours - including doorknobs and *tables*
but when stored in moist conditions such in mucus , this is extended
survival time depends on the surface , and the room temperature
@entity318 can be killed using household bleach and people must come into direct contact with the sample to risk infection
