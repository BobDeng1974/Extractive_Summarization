by @entity0 correspondent published : 17:25 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 17:29 est , 5 march 2014 the king of the @entity3 has vented his anger over a diplomatic row that saw him pull out of a meeting with the @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity9 said he was ‘ not some carnival act to be rolled out at the beck and call of anyone ’ after officials offered him a supposedly paltry 90 - minute meeting with the royal couple during their visit to @entity18 next month			1
the king blamed ‘ faceless bureaucrats ’ for ‘ a grave error of judgment ’ , and said the full reasons for his refusal were ‘ conveyed to the royal couple in a personal letter			1
offended : @entity9 of the @entity3 ( left ) objected to only being given a 90 - minute slot during the planned visit to @entity18 of the @entity7 and @entity8 ( right ) of @entity29 next month			1
he has sent the @entity31 pair a letter the furore risks overshadowing @entity34 and @entity8 ’s tour of the country , which begins in @entity37 on april 7			0
not only was the meeting considered to be hugely important as a mark of respect to the indigenous community , but @entity34 and @entity8 would have been following in the footsteps of the @entity43 and prince @entity44 , who visited @entity9 ’s mother , @entity45 , in 1953			1
the @entity43 visited her again in 1995 and shortly before she died in 2006 and was succeeded by her son , prince @entity47 wrote to the queen to congratulate her on the 40th anniversary of her coronation , saying : ‘ our two families have enjoyed a wonderful friendship			2
‘ the 40 years of the leadership , courage and stability you have so far given to the people of @entity60 and indeed to the wider world ... is an immeasurable treasure			0
’ the @entity3 people had hoped that the @entity7 and @entity8 would visit their ruler at his home at @entity66 - his people ’s ‘ sacred ’ place - during a visit to the country ’s @entity69			2
historic ties : prince @entity34 receives a hongi , a @entity3 greeting , from a tribal leader in 2011 during a visit in which he met grieving families of the victims of the @entity78 on @entity18 's @entity79 locals had been planning the couple ’s itinerary for weeks , saying they were looking forward to welcoming the young royals to the ‘ heart of the kingitanga ’ , the @entity3 monarchy			1
but on tuesday the @entity87 revealed that @entity9 was so insulted by the suggestion the couple could offer only 90 minutes out of their schedule , he pulled out of the visit completely			1
according to sources , the long list of demands around the visit and tight timeframe would have broken proper protocol on the marae			0
in a statement yesterday his office said : ‘ @entity102 was never asked anything , he was simply told			0
‘ the government - appointed committee overseeing the visit never met with any officials from this office and when we did seek to contact them , they were not willing to be negotiable or flexible in their approaches to the king			2
‘ a senior rangatira [ official ] noted that the king and the kiingitanga [ the royal line ] are not some carnival act to be rolled out at the beck and call of anyone , and nor should we be prepared to compromise our tikanga [ customs ] to fit into a pre-determined schedule			0
’ history : the royal couple would have followed in the footsteps of the @entity43 , who met the @entity3 king 's mother @entity45 in 1953 and again in 1995 , when she wore traditional dress ( left ) it added : ‘ the king wanted to give his best to this couple to reflect their status , he was being prevented from doing that			1
’ @entity18 prime minister @entity139 described the king ’s decision as ‘ a shame ’			2
he said the ‘ generous ’ slot offered was longer than most engagements the couple had in the country			0
a @entity148 spokesman also stressed there would be ‘ numerous chances ’ to meet members of the @entity3 community at the many traditional welcomes from different tribes the couple will receive			0
they said : ‘ the programme for the visit , including the @entity3 elements , has been signed off by the @entity160			0
‘ many elements were considered and we have worked with the @entity160 to include several appropriate events on the visit to recognise the significant of @entity3 culture			0
' these include a substantial @entity167 , or ceremonial welcome , in @entity37 , together with @entity3 engagements in @entity170 , @entity171 and elsewhere			0
’ the @entity7 and @entity8 - accompanied by their son , @entity174 - will arrive in @entity18 on april 7 and visit @entity37 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity29 , @entity170 , @entity178 and @entity171 before leaving for @entity179 on april 16 .			1
