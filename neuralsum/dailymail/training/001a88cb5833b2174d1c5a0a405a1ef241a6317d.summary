sales of @entity2 apples are set to hit a 20 - year high but ironically , the rise of apples grown in the @entity17 has stemmed from the fact we are planting large numbers of foreign varieties traditional @entity2 apples like @entity9 may have a superior taste , however the likes of @entity8 are easier to grow , producing more fruit per tree and are more likely to meet the @entity33 ’s designated ‘ @entity32 ’ status			1
the @entity35 can trace its heritage back to 1830 , at @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity2 , where it was developed by the retired brewer and horticulturist @entity9			1
by contrast the @entity8 is a much more modern variety			0
it is believed to have originated from a cross between a @entity44 and @entity45 and was discovered as a chance seedling in 1952 by a farmer in the @entity48 , @entity23			1
the first gala was a cross between the @entity51 and the @entity53 ’s @entity52 and was planted in @entity23 in the 1930s and is now grown across the globe			1
new research shows that this season ’s sales of @entity2 - grown apples reached 92,700 tonnes at the end of january , a significant increase on the 75,000 tonnes sold at the same point last year			2
the rise in demand and sales was announced by @entity66 , head of the industry body @entity67 and @entity68 , who expects total sales of the 2014 crop to hit 130,000 tonnes – up by 15,000 on the year before			2
the boom in favourites , including @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , was fuelled by good weather , which boosted production , and increased availability in 2003 just 23 per cent of apples sold here came from @entity17 orchards , however this is now up to more than 30per cent and the industry is aiming for 65 per cent			1
mr @entity66 said a tactical decision by growers to switch to producing apples that originated overseas has been a huge factor in the industry ’s growth , describing the transformation as ‘ electrifying ’			2
he said sales of @entity17 produced gala apples were up by 7,900 tonnes on last year ’s figures , rising to 29,600 tonnes by the end of january			1
such is demand that the 2014 @entity2 crop is expected to be sold out by april			0

total consumption in 2014 was 482,000 tonnes , which was down by 9per cent on the 527,000 in 2011			0
