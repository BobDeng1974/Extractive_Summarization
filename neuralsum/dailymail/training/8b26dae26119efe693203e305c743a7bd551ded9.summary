by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 01:38 est , 11 april 2013 eastern @entity3 migrants are more likely to have jobs than native @entity5 , a research study revealed yesterday			1
the finding is in contrast with other countries with high levels of immigration from @entity3 , where the reverse is true			2
researchers found that in the @entity5 , workers from the countries that joined the @entity15 in 2004 and later were 7 per cent more likely to be in work than @entity5 - born people			1
a research study has revealed @entity3 migrants are more likely to have jobs than native @entity5 but in @entity22 , the @entity23 and @entity24 locally - born workers have a higher employment rate than migrant workers from the new @entity15 countries , the study said			1
the report , by two @entity24 academics , was presented yesterday to a conference on migration at @entity32 organised by @entity33 , a @entity3 organisation of state - funded research councils			0
it said that while @entity3 workers in @entity5 are more likely to have jobs than locals , their jobs are often among the most low paid			1
this appears to support the long - held argument that many migrants are more willing to take low - paid jobs than those of @entity5 birth			1
as early as 2007 , official figures showed that four out of five newly - created jobs were going to migrants			0
the findings that migrants are filling vacant jobs while many @entity5 people draw the dole comes as a heated debate rages over welfare spending			1
the debate has been inflamed by the case of benefit - dependent @entity59 who was jailed for life for killing six of his children in a house fire			0
@entity66 and @entity67 expressed concerns in the wake of the case that the welfare system subsidises worklessness and feckless behaviour			0
the findings come as a heated debate rages over welfare spending			0
@entity66 and @entity67 ( pictured ) have expressed concerns , in the wake of the @entity59 case , that the welfare system subsidises worklessness and feckless behaviour this month has seen the introduction of a string of benefit reforms intended to make a life on benefits less attractive and to make it more worthwhile for claimants to look for low - paid work			0
the @entity24 report , by @entity88 and @entity89 , said that one of the key factors affecting the job chances of @entity3 migrants is labour market conditions in the countries to which they move			2
they said : ‘ we find that @entity3 immigrants had a lower probability of employment on average in comparison to natives in all other countries except for the @entity5 during the period 2004 to 2009			2
’ according to the findings , @entity3 migrants were 16.1 per cent less likely to be employed than locals in the @entity23 , where workers from @entity106 and the seven other countries that joined the @entity15 in 2004 were allowed to work freely in 2008			1
in @entity24 , where @entity3 could work from 2007 , they were 5.7 per cent less likely to have a job than locals			2
@entity22 kept strict restrictions on @entity3 workers until 2011 , but in the period covered by the report @entity3 workers who did move to @entity22 were around 11 per cent less likely than @entity22 to have a job			0
‘ in the @entity5 , the employment gap in favour of new member state immigrants is around 7 percentage points , ’ the report found .			0

eastern @entity121 7 per cent more likely to be in work than @entity5 people
result *differs* with other countries with immigration from @entity3
study found migrants ' jobs were often among the most low paid
