@entity0 had fractured his ankle bone on the eve of the event while out running in @entity40 near his @entity42 home			0
but the 39 - year - old raced into a 5 - 1 lead at the tournament where it all started for him as a 17 - year - old , setting for his first major trophy			1
and despite a superb rally from the 25 - year - old world @entity51 , the 2011 @entity52 winner , @entity0 closed out the match			1
at one stage it had looked like @entity6 was about to pull off one of the most famous snooker comebacks , up there with @entity58 against @entity59 at the @entity61 final in 1985			0
@entity6 keeps an eye on @entity0 's progress after going 3 - 1 down early on in the contest @entity0 ( left ) and @entity6 shake hands before the final of the 2014 @entity67 @entity68 takes @entity69 @entity0 said : “ i have had to dig really deep in this tournament , especially with the foot over these last 12 days			1
it has been very hard , so these are great moments			0
“ i do n’t know how i won after seeing him come back from 9 - 4 down			1
he hardly missed a ball and i was gone			0
“ if i had lost with that big a lead i would have been severely disappointed , the pressure was mounting			0
“ i just know after the other @entity80 final last month i do n’t want to be playing @entity6 every time in these , he is such a tough opponent			0

i just left it too late once again			0
four - time champion @entity0 was not at his best but still manged to establish a 5 - 3 interval lead @entity0 ( left ) watches on as @entity6 plays a shot at the at the @entity9 in @entity8 “ i felt very relaxed out there and am just a bit annoyed i did n’t get a good chance in the decider , because i knew i had that form in me			1
” @entity6 is often seen as the natural successor to @entity0 , a reputation helped along nicely when he became the youngest player to make a 147 maximum break in a competitive match at just 14			2
a natural showman who thrived on atmosphere and big crowds , his initial progress on tour was hindered by qualifying matches played with neither present			0
the breakthrough was inevitable though and came in 2011 with a first ranking title at the @entity107 , huge credit in defeat despite a world final loss to @entity112 in @entity113 , and success in the @entity52 event with a 10 - 8 win over @entity117			2
@entity6 managed a break of 50 to level at 1 - 1 – but then lost the next four frames with some nerves taking hold			2
@entity6 had noted before the final that @entity0 had not been at his best last week despite a 13th career 147 break – but expected him to raise the bar for the showpiece			0
and he was right , with the @entity127 knocking in breaks of 82 and 81 – only for @entity6 to keep the contest alive by pocketing the last two frames of the afternoon			0
the players emerged to a deafening reception in the evening , and @entity0 kept his foot on the gas by quickly extending his lead to 7 - 3			0
@entity6 clung on , but a magnificent break of 133 , the 770th of @entity0 ’s career , re-established his four - frame advantage			2
from 9 - 4 down @entity6 rallied , and back to back centuries of 120 , 127 and 86 left him at just 9 - 8 adrift			1
