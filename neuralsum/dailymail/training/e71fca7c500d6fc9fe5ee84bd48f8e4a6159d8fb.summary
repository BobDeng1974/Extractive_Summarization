he had enjoyed a cup of tea at a seafront pub in @entity27 , @entity28 , and fell as he walked a few yards to meet his daughter @entity29 , who was waiting for him in her car			0
but then he had to wait for an hour - and - a - half before the emergency services arrived			2
now his family say he ' deserved much better ' - with his son - in - law , retired cardiologist @entity32 , saying he believed the ambulance took so long because of mr @entity0 's age			1
' waiting for the ambulance seemed to go on forever , ' mr @entity32 said as he recounted the incident , which happened in may			2
' we made at least three calls and i had to answer the same questions every time			0
@entity0 had broken his wrist and banged his head - it was a severe injury			1
' i am a medic but you do n't have to be a doctor to know that the quicker you get to a head injury the better the chances of survival			0
' had the ambulance got there in the usual 20 minutes , the chances of his survival would have been better			1
' an inquest into mr @entity0 's death was held in @entity53 , @entity18 last month , but full details of the ambulance delay have only now emerged			1
mrs @entity29 said she agreed with the hearing 's accidental death verdict - but she stressed her father may have survived if he 'd been treated as a priority case ' at 92 he had been through the last war , ' she added			2
' he lived with us in a self contained flat , was no burden on the state whatsoever and was in good health			0
' it 's so sad because he just missed out on all the d - day 70th anniversary commemorations , which he was really looking forward to			1
mr @entity0 , pictured in his @entity5 uniform , left , was a second world war veteran and his daughter @entity70 , right , says that he deserved better ' he wanted to make 100 and probably would have done so			1
' @entity71 ( @entity72 ) carried out a full investigation into the incident			2
chief executive @entity75 gave his ' sincere apologies ' for the long wait in a personal letter to the @entity79 after the probe			0
mr @entity75 told the couple : ' i am able to state that between the time of 14.49 and 15.44 hours , all other emergency ambulances were either not available to respond for various reasons , or assigned to other emergency incidents which were coded higher and immediately life threatening or out of service for a variety of reasons			0
' he insisted that the patient 's age does not affect the coding of a 999 call or level of response provided			2
mr @entity0 died the day after the fall at @entity10 after suffering a broken wrist and a bleed on the brain last night , @entity101 , @entity72 senior locality manager for north @entity28 , said : ' we have been in contact with mr @entity0 's family about what happened and the operational demand we faced on the day of his accident			1
' we prioritise all 999 calls according to those patients in most serious need , but clearly want to reach and treat every patient as quickly as is possible			2
' as we work hard to put more ambulances on the road with more new staff recruited in @entity28 , this will improve our response times			0
' mrs @entity29 said that her father volunteered to join the @entity5 in november 1940 when he was just 18 - even though his worried mother wanted him to wait to be called up			1
he was accepted for aircrew training and sent to @entity121 's @entity120 , the leading training site in the @entity122 for air gunners			0
