by @entity0 @entity1 already has his sights set on coming back with a bang at next month ’s @entity5 @entity4			1
despite booking what eventually turned out to be a third - placed finish at the season - opening race in @entity9 following @entity11 ’s disqualification , the year has been an uphill struggle for @entity1 and @entity13			1
the team endured a wretched run of three consecutive races without a point in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 before finally ending their drought last time out in @entity22			2
video : scroll down to watch @entity1 take part in extraordinary car wash on the up : @entity1 was back amongst the points in @entity22 two weeks ago as @entity1 concedes , there was ' a sense of relief ' in removing that particular monkey from their back , although the veteran knows in finishing sixth , with team - mate @entity36 10th , it was just a small step on the road to competitiveness			1
@entity1 would like to believe there will be further improvement this weekend in @entity42 - the scene of one of his most spectacular triumphs in 2011 - before moving on to @entity48 ’s return to the calendar , and then more importantly @entity50			1
' the points we scored in @entity22 were okay , however the most important thing for us as a team was not how many points we picked up there but the progress , ' said @entity1			1
' i feel there is progress being made in the team			0
the way the car feels is good , and we are going in the right direction			0
' it ’s still going to take time			0
we ’re not going to set the world alight in @entity42 this weekend , but hopefully there will be a bit more progression			2
' then we ’ve @entity48 , then @entity50 where it would be nice to have a good package			0
i think we ’ll have some good parts for there			0
' with @entity1 out of contract at the end of the season , racing director @entity76 has hinted another could be in the pipeline given the 34 - year - old ’s crucial insight in the team ’s time of need			2
@entity76 said : ' despite our current lack of pace , @entity1 continues to be an absolutely fantastic ambassador for the team			2
' not only is he a fantastic driver , but he ’s also somebody with the feel and experience to steer the team and give it direction for development			0
taste of success : @entity1 celebrates winning the @entity42 @entity4 in 2011 ' his input has been invaluable , and he remains a tireless contributor			1
' whilst the result in @entity22 was a welcome one for @entity76 , the @entity100 is fully aware it was also far below what is expected of @entity13			1
' of course it was n’t nice when we were not scoring any points , ' said @entity76			0
' but we need to get back to where we should be , which is the most important thing			0
' @entity22 is a special race , and it was good to be in the points there , but the target is to be in the points every race , and then the big points every race			1

@entity1 finished third in opening race of the season in @entity9
@entity13 were back among the points in @entity22 after three *barren* weeks
