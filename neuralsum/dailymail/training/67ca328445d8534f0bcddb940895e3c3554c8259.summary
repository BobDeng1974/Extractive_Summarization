it sounds like science fiction , but building a giant ball around the sun to harness its power could be closer than you think - we just have to blow up the planet @entity7			1
an emerging technology expert has claimed that we can start building a @entity11 sphere ( a sort of spherical solar panel ) that would give us more energy than we will ever need within a matter of decades			1
@entity16 said that by ‘ taking apart ’ the whole of @entity7 , asteroids and even other planets like @entity20 we can gather enough material to complete the huge project			1
@entity7 , as captured by the messenger spacecraft : mining the planet could offer humanity raw materials for the next stage in its evolution but rather than a solid shell it would be a ‘ large number of independent constructs orbiting in a dense formation around the sun ’ @entity36 's horizon and the @entity38 's solar array panels : a @entity11 sphere would use the same principle but on a much grander scale @entity16 , chair of the @entity43 based @entity44 , wrote about his bold , blue skies plan on the organisation ’s website			1
he believes the project can be started in 25 to 50 years and the first phase could be completed within a few decades			1
but rather than a solid shell it would be a ‘ large number of independent constructs orbiting in a dense formation around the sun ’ , which could be built in stages			2
these would form a ‘ receiving surface ’ around the sun which could absorb the energy from the sun to power the next phase of the project , rather than relying on fuel brought from @entity36			2
it all sounds well and good but even @entity16 admits there are a number of hurdles - not least the fact that no astronaut has ever been to @entity7			1
another major issue would be @entity70 cites a plan by @entity73 physicist @entity72 which breaks it down into five ‘ ten year surges ’ , starting with the assembling of the first array.but he adds : ‘ we ’re going to have to mine materials from @entity7			2
actually , we ’ll likely have to take the whole planet apart			0
‘ the @entity11 sphere will require a horrendous amount of material - so much so , in fact , that , should we want to completely envelope the sun , we are going to have to disassemble not just @entity7 , but @entity20 , some of the outer planets , and any nearby asteroids as well ’			1
the concept of a @entity11 sphere , also known as a @entity11 shell , was dreamed up by astronomer @entity11 in 1959			0
but until now it has been the stuff of science fiction and appeared in books like @entity93 by writer @entity94 where it was a gift from an alien race			0
@entity16 writes : ‘ a @entity11 sphere would provide us with more energy than we would ever know what to do with while dramatically increasing our living space			0
‘ given that our resources here on @entity36 are starting to dwindle , and combined with the problem of increasing demand for more energy and living space , this would seem to a good long - term plan for our species			0
’ in his plan however he does not explain how the energy from the @entity113 could be brought back 93 million miles to @entity36			0
@entity16 adds : ‘ it seems clear that the idea of constructing a @entity11 sphere should no longer be relegated to science fiction or our dreams of the deep future			0
‘ like other speculative projects , like the space elevator or terraforming @entity122 , we should seriously consider putting this alongside our other near - term plans for space exploration and work			0

scientists aim to begin project within 25 years
' spherical solar generator ' made of orbiting panels
we would have to *demolish* @entity20 , @entity7 and several asteroids
