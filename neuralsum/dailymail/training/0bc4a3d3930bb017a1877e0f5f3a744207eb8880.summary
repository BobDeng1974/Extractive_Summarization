he is one of the most recognisable faces on the planet right now – not least in light of yesterday ’s incident on the football pitch where he appeared to bite defender @entity7 during his country ’s crucial @entity9 clash with @entity11			1
a pretty uncanny resemblance : controversial toothsome @entity14 ( left ) and smiling flight attendant ' @entity13 ' ( right ) but if the @entity17 football authorities are looking for a way to defend their key striker after his latest controversial moment , they might be able to claim that @entity21 could not have put his teeth into the opposition – as he was thousands of miles away on a plane			0
specifically , he was on a @entity27 flight serving drinks to adoring football supporters			0
that , at least , seems to be the evidence that has emerged from this amusing video			0
it shows a busy flight to an unspecified destination on the low - cost carrier , and what appears to be the millionaire footballer helping to serve drinks to passengers – to the joy of a group of fans of @entity21 ’s club team @entity44 , who serenade the ‘ star ’ with gusto			1
it is , of course , an oddly convincing lookalike			2
but should @entity52 become really desperate in their bid to keep their best player away from a lengthy ban that would certainly hinder their chances of winning the tournament , they could always use the video as ‘ proof ’ that the man who appeared to use his opponent as a chew toy in the @entity65 sunshine last night can only have been a doppelganger .			2

@entity52 star seemed to bite @entity70 opponent in @entity9 game yesterday
amusing new footage *suggests* he may have been far away on a plane
@entity27 passengers and @entity44 fans serenaded the convincing lookalike
