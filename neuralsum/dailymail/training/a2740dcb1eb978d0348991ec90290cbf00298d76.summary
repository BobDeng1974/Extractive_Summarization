by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 03:17 est , 2 april 2013 campaign : @entity3 aid money to @entity4 is allegedly used to fund party of president @entity6 @entity3 's decision to make @entity4 its biggest recipient of foreign aid is under scrutiny amid claims that £ 300million is helping to bankroll @entity13 ’s former party			1
in evidence to a @entity17 inquiry , an aid expert alleged the @entity18 was being used to buy support for mrs @entity13 ’s widower , president @entity6 , and his party			1
@entity22 , a visiting fellow at the @entity23 , said the @entity24 was pouring money into a scheme used to buy votes			1
‘ this is is the mechanism – which is funded partly by @entity24 – to make friends and influence people			2
this is the re-election campaign of mr @entity6 , which is funded by @entity24 , ’ he said			1
the @entity34 on @entity35 is due to publish a report into aid to @entity4 on thursday			2
the @entity3 ’s development assistance is expected to more than double between 2011 and 2015 , meaning @entity4 will become the @entity3 ’s biggest aid recipient – getting almost £ 450million per year by 2015			1
some 60million people in @entity4 , one in three , live in poverty and regularly go hungry			0
@entity4 has 12million out - of - school children and half of all adults , including two of every three women , can not read and write			0
however , @entity4 ’s status as the potential largest recipient of @entity3 aid is controversial , given its unstable political situation , large defence budget , activities of the military and intelligence services , level of corruption and tax avoidance , and position as a middle - income country			1
@entity3 has said the increase in aid is conditional on the government of @entity4 ’s own progress in widening the country ’s tax base and tackling corruption			1
but the @entity66 warned recently in a report that plans for a vast hike in aid should be ‘ approached cautiously ’			2
‘ we note that @entity24 has no track record of delivering programmes in @entity4 on the scale that is now contemplated , ’ the report warned			0
half of the £ 300million going to the controversial scheme in @entity4 will be given to families to help lift them out of poverty , while the rest will be used to encourage parents to send children to school			0
accusations : aid expert @entity22 alleged the @entity18 was being used to buy support for the party of president @entity6 , who is the widower of @entity13 but opposition parties complain the name of the programme means many people believe the money comes from the @entity92 rather than the government			1
‘ the fact it is called @entity18 tends to suggest there is what is called clientelism , ’ said dr @entity22			0
‘ the more you give the more benefit there is to the party that bears the @entity13 name			1
’ @entity103 , the cricketer turned politician , claimed the programme was nothing more than a scam to ‘ buy votes ’			2
the biggest opposition party , the @entity110 , has said it would reform the scheme and rename it the @entity113 to avoid the charge of using it for political benefit			0
a @entity24 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity3 is politically impartial in @entity4			1
our aid is based on need and effectiveness , not politics			2
the @entity123 was unanimously passed and supported by all political parties in @entity4			0
' we keep our programme in @entity4 under constant review , and will continue to do so after the elections			0
' economic reform in @entity4 , including on tax , will be critical post-election , whoever wins			0
it will be important for elected politicians to show leadership to the @entity4 electorate and a commitment to reform by submitting tax returns and paying tax due			0
