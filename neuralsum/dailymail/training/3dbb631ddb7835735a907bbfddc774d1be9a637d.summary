by @entity0 a school in @entity3 has become the first in @entity5 to teach pupils while they are standing up , it was revealed today			1
nine and ten - year - old pupils at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , are taking part in a pilot - run by local medical researchers in a bid to improve concentration and health			1
the seven - week scheme will see pupils take it in turn to stand behind six desks while the others sit down as usual , with each student spending a carefully - calculated 230 minutes standing each week			1
schools in @entity39 , @entity40 and the @entity41 have already tried the idea , but the @entity44 children at @entity45 are thought to be the first in @entity5 to use the innovative desks			1
teacher @entity48 , 28 , said : ‘ the pupils have been so excited to take part in this experiment , and they absolutely love it			1
‘ we ’ve only been doing it two weeks in my class and already i can see an improvement			0
i ’ve got a very active class and i think they ’re really responding to having more freedom			0
test : the pupils ' weight , height , blood pressure , waist circumference and fine motor skills are being taken during the experiment , and the results will be compared at the end standing up : @entity26 ( left ) and ten - year - old @entity70 ( right ) are involved in the seven - week scheme which will see pupils take it in turn to stand behind six desks while the others sit down as usual ‘ it keeps them focused			1
they ’re working better , their concentration is better , and when given the option , they want to continue standing rather than going back to sitting			0
the year group of 55 pupils whose parents gave permission for them to take part in the trial was divided into two			1
the first half used the standing desks for seven weeks from february to the @entity92 half term , while the second half started using the desks after @entity92 for another seven weeks			2
during the experiment , pupils are being monitored in two ways			2
one is with an actigraph accelerator - a red box worn on the waist like a pedometer to monitor how much physical activity is carried out			2
they are also examined with an actipal activity monitor - a small patch stuck to the thigh , which measures whether the pupils is standing or sitting			1
their weight , height , blood pressure , waist circumference and fine motor skills are also being taken , and the results will be compared at the end of the study			0
‘ it does n’t seem to be limited to certain lessons , as it seems to be working for everything - maths , @entity120 , even using a laptop			2
‘ and i ’m glad that the excitement of the experiment has shown them that scientists are n’t boring or stuffy - science can be fun , like this			2
’ dr @entity128 , principal research fellow at medical researchers born in @entity9 , said : ‘ the idea is two-fold			1
firstly , we want to see whether we can change pupils ’ behaviour			2
‘ we know if you can establish healthy lifestyles early in life , they can be continued into adulthood			0
‘ so a less sedentary lifestyle while you ’re a child means less sedentary adults			0
there have also been studies which show that conditions like diabetes are affected by sitting for long periods of time			0
‘ secondly , sitting for a long period of time has been shown to have a negative impact on children in terms of concentration and behaviour			0
we want to see if this study will change that			0
‘ born in @entity9 is a social study looking at a number of babies born in the city after 2007 , and is now working with @entity158 on the standing learning project			2
@entity160 : schools in @entity39 , @entity40 and the @entity41 have already tried the idea , but @entity163 is thought to be the first in @entity5 to use the innovative desks dr @entity166 said that the idea came from a school in @entity39 , which has now secured funding to roll out the trial over a number of schools in the country - proving its ‘ feasibility ’			1
she added : ‘ the idea is used in a school in @entity39 , @entity40 and one in @entity178 , @entity41 - but as far as we know it ’s not been done anywhere else in @entity5			1
’ ' i 'm glad that the excitement of the experiment has shown [ the pupils ] that scientists are n't boring or stuffy - science can be fun , like this ' @entity48 , teacher the desks , which can be raised and lowered with a handle , have been donated by a company called @entity192			1
dr @entity166 , who is working with four others on the study , said the hoped to have results of this first study by mid-september			0
@entity8 was opened in 1969 and has around 420 children in its main school as well as 52 in the nursery			0
but its latest @entity201 inspection in november 2013 concluded that it was ' a school that requires improvement '			0
the report said there was an ' inconsistent ' quality of teaching , governors were ' not holding leaders to account ' and white @entity3 pupils were ' not doing as well as similar pupils across the country ' .			0
