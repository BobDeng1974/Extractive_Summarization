by @entity1 reporter published : 09:42 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 09:42 est , 21 june 2012 @entity2 is very happy with his first birthday present - a pair of new legs			1
the youngster lost his own when he was four months old after he became critically ill with meningitis			1
surgeons were forced to amputate them below the knee in order to save his life			2
now @entity2 has received his first prosthetic pair in time for his first birthday			1
@entity2 wears his new legs			1
doctors have told his parents to let him guide them with how long he wants to wear them his parents , @entity21 , 29 , and @entity22 , 31 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , hope he will soon learn to walk and take his first steps			2
mrs @entity26 said : ' it was so weird looking at the legs and thinking that @entity2 will learn to walk with them on			1
' we were so nervous before he got them			2
we were worried that he may not like them or feel uncomfortable			0
we did n’t want to have to encourage him to wear them if he did n’t want them on			0
' we put his trousers on the legs and we were told to buy shoes to be placed on the feet			2
' @entity2 was given the legs yesterday at a specialist prosthetics unit at @entity41 in @entity42			1
he also lost all of the fingers on his left hand and the tips of his fingers on his right hand			0
@entity2 was too young to be walking when he lost his legs mrs @entity26 said : ' when he first had them put on , he grabbed the shoes and smiled			1
he was so comfortable in them that he fell asleep wearing them in the car on the way home			0
' he looks much older now he has the legs because he is taller			1
he always seemed much younger than his sister @entity59 was at this age but now he seems more like a toddler than a baby			0
' we have been told to let him lead us with how much time he wants to spend wearing the legs			2
if he wants to wear them for a little as half an hour a day we will let him			0
' we are hoping that , if he wants to , he may be able to crawl with them			0
we have been told that we need to encourage him to walk wearing them in just the same way that we would any other child			0
' as he gets older the money raised will also be used to buy state - of - the - art prosthetic legs at a cost of around £ 7,000 per leg			1
@entity21 added : ' as @entity2 is growing it does n’t really make sense to be spending that amount of money on legs that he will keep growing out of so he will just have the @entity80 ones for now			1
' as he gets older he may want to take part in sport and we want to be able to say that we have the money to be able to buy him the legs that he wants			1
' @entity2 back in march : he lost his legs from below the knee to meningitis @entity21 said that doctors praised her quick reaction spotting the first warning signs and that if she had left it any longer he may have died			1
' i had bathed @entity2 with his sister @entity59 as normal but throughout the night he kept waking up crying and was sick , i noticed he had a temperature so stripped him down and gave him some @entity94			1
' it was when i stripped him down that i noticed two small red pin prick marks			0
i pressed on them and they did n’t go away so thought something was wrong			0
' within a matter of minutes he had gone grey and floppy so i rung for an ambulance			0
' as i was watching he went from having a few marks to all his legs and arms turning purple			2
' they took him to @entity109 and treated him for meningitis , it was all a bit of a shock and it did n’t really hit home until we had the results of the blood test which confirmed that he had meningococcal septicaemia			0
' @entity118 was transferred to @entity119 where he was kept in intensive care for two weeks then put onto the children ’s surgical ward			0
she added : ' the doctors said that if i had n’t checked on him and spotted the rash when i did that @entity126 probably would have died			0
' the first 48 hours were touch and go and after that they gave him a 50 per cent chance of survival which gradually increased as the days went on			0
' @entity2 ’s family have set up the @entity134 ( @entity135 ’s @entity136 to help buy equipment needed to support him as he grows			1
they aim to be able to have enough money to buy specialist prosthetic legs at the cost of £ 7,000 per leg by the time he wants to take part in sports .			2
