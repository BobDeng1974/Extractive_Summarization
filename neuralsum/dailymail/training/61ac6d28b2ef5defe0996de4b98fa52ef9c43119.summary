by the end of saturday , he ’s hoping to have gotten rid of nearly all of it — at an auction to benefit his ailing daughter			1
mr @entity2 ’s daughter suffers from a rare autoimmune disease that makes her bones dangerously brittle and causes her body ’s defenses to attack her own blood vessels			1
a memorabilia expert who ’s not involved in the sale described mr @entity2 ’s collection as ' once - in - a - lifetime ' and expects the auction to attract big spenders			1
' it ’s for a higher purpose , ' said the 67 - year - old mr @entity2			1
his daughter , 43 - year - old @entity39 , suffers from mixed connective tissue disorder , or @entity41 , which shares features with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis			1

' some days are better than others			2
' pretty price : holding up a copy of his autographed @entity68 book mr @entity2 believes his collection could bring in $ 4.5 million benefiting : money raised from the collection is to go to his daughter , @entity39 , who suffers a rare autoimmune disease that makes her bones dangerously brittle and causes her body 's defenses to attack her own blood vessels but she also sees the sale as a chance for her father ’s private collection to have a public debut that shows the value of his years of collecting			1
the sale is taking place at a warehouse outside @entity87 with @entity88 ' i had never looked at this to benefit me			2
i just want to see my father make it , ' she said			2
@entity39 said she did n’t bother turning down her father ’s offer			2
he would n’t have listened to her anyway			2
mr @entity2 says he began collecting memorabilia after meeting actress @entity98 in 1980			1
by the end of the evening , @entity98 had given mr @entity2 five photographs with her signature on each			1
from there , he pieced together his collection by attending golf tournaments and other celebrity appearances , often carrying head shots and other glossy photos to be signed			2
he scoured garage sales for collectibles			2
he even bought some items from friends			2
' when i started , i said everything i get has to be on an item with their picture on it , ' he said			0
' anybody can walk up to a celebrity and get a piece of paper and have them sign it			0
but to be prepared and to get it on a photo , takes a lot more work			0
but it ’s more viable			0
' prized collection : one of mr @entity131 's antique books are seen , one of 680 others and over 22,520 photos that will be auctioned off in @entity26 on saturday throughout the years , his collection grew to include 22,500 - plus original photos with everyone from @entity138 to @entity139 and @entity140			1
mr @entity2 said he researches every photo ’s authenticity before including it in the collection by recording every detail from where it came from to its condition			0
he then follows two dozen other steps before placing the photos in protective plastic covers			0
' there is a profit factor here , but if you calculate all of the sacrifices that we ’ve made , it ’s a return on investment , ' said mr @entity2 , who ’s earned money with a number of jobs ranging from counseling veterans to helping businesses be more efficient			0

strangling costs : mrs @entity39 , a mother of two , rummages through her medications that cost $ 2,200 a month through her insurance with her deductible being $ 1,250 the collection has n’t been independently appraised , but the auction house and mr @entity2 believe it ’s worth $ 4.5 million based on valuations for comparable items that have sold recently			1
mr @entity2 and the auction house also say his books would beat the @entity195 for a private collection of autographed books			0
they ’ve asked @entity195 to verify the claim , but it has n’t said whether it will send a judge to the auction			0
' i do n’t think there ’s been a collection like this offered , or featured , in the history of auctions , ' said @entity208 , the owner of the auction house			1
the auction will include a dozen lots divided by category , so the 7,300 - plus books will be auctioned as a complete set			1
bids can be made online and the auction is expected to last just over an hour			0
' that ’s a hall of fame caliber collection , ' said @entity217 , who sells trading cards and other items for @entity220 on @entity221			0
' that is a once in a lifetime collection that needs to be seen by everyone			0
' @entity217 , who is n’t involved in the sale , said the collection should attract some of the biggest spenders in the industry			0
