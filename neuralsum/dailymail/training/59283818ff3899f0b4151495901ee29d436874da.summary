the two men behind the @entity2 invasion that led to today ’s crisis were busy enjoying themselves yesterday			1
@entity4 and @entity5 showed little concern over the execution of mr @entity8 and the continuing carnage in @entity10			1
mr @entity4 , now the special envoy to the @entity11 , was pictured over the weekend on his summer holiday in shorts , flip - flops and sunglasses			1
mr @entity4 is currently enjoying ‘ @entity30 ’ on @entity31 , the largest of the @entity33 islands off the north coast of @entity21			1
he and wife @entity17 were staying there as guests of wealthy industrialist @entity38 and his wife @entity39 , who have a luxurious villa on the island			0
the @entity42 were seen out and about dining on prawns and seafood platters at several of @entity31 ’s best restaurants , and on a yacht belonging to one of mr @entity38 ’s friends			0
it is thought the @entity42 left @entity31 on tuesday , but it is not clear where they were heading			0
mr @entity4 is officially the @entity4 for the @entity11 on behalf of the quartet - the @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 - with a brief to help broker peace between the @entity59 and @entity60			2
but his role might be expected to see him take a wider interest in the region			0
the last post on his official website was on july 31 when he welcomed the ( as it turned out , short - lived ) @entity10 ceasefire and said he hoped it would secure ‘ a broad , sustainable and long - term solution to the crisis ’			0
together with former @entity5 , mr @entity4 has faced criticism for his handling of the @entity2 war while prime minister and the toppling of @entity2 dictator @entity75 without carefully laying the foundations for a @entity78 regime			1
yesterday , hours after the video of @entity55 journalist @entity8 being beheaded by an @entity81 militant was put on the internet , mr @entity5 posted a video of himself clowning around and having a bucket of water poured over his head on his own @entity88 page			1
he was taking part in the so - called ice bucket challenge , which has caught on with notable figures participating in the campaign to raise money for the fight against @entity95 , or @entity97 ’s disease , a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord			1
the former president 's wife @entity102 pours water over him before he nominates his predecessor @entity105 the stunt was poorly timed - it was released just hours after video showing journalist @entity8 being beheaded was publicly released in the video , mr @entity5 nominates @entity105 , his predecessor as @entity55 president , to take the challenge next			1
mr @entity5 said : ‘ to you all who challenged me , i do not think it ’s presidential for me to be splashed with ice water , so i ’m simply going to write you a check ’ , before his wife @entity102 comes into shot , douses him and says : ‘ that check is from me - i did n’t want to ruin my hairstyle			2
’ former @entity121 executive mr @entity38 previously provided hospitality to the @entity42 in 2006 when mrs @entity123 stayed at his mansion on a hill overlooking @entity126 while she attended events as an ambassador for the @entity129			0
mrs @entity130 is a trustee of the @entity131			0
mr @entity4 infamously enjoyed a free holiday in @entity133 at the 27 - bedroom villa of since - disgraced @entity136 premier and billionaire @entity137 in 2004			2
that jolly was much remarked on at the time - both because @entity139 were appalled at their leader accepting hospitality from such a sleazy right - wing host , and the fact @entity137 sported a ridiculous bandana during their public appearances , to conceal the aftermath of a hair transplant			0
in august last year , while there was a crisis in @entity150 after claims of a chemical weapons attack in @entity153 , mr @entity4 was to be found in @entity133 again , this time on a superyacht owned by @entity55 music mogul @entity155 , and then in @entity156 , the perennial playground of the international playboy			2
yesterday a spokesman for mr @entity4 declined to discuss what he was doing in @entity31 .			0
