most fairytales are overrun with wicked witches , entrapped princesses and dashing young princes			1
but a new collection offers a different take on the classics - without the @entity7			1
the stories were compiled by @entity10 historian @entity9 in the 1880s - around the same time as the @entity12 folk tales - from across the @entity14 region of @entity15			1
twist in the tale : the stories , published in @entity18 ( left ) were compiled by @entity9 around the same time as the @entity12			1
right : a @entity20 illustration and now the collection , which lay undiscovered in a local archive for 150 years , is set to be published in @entity24 for the first time , the @entity21 reports			1
while the well - known @entity28 fairytales often feature a vulnerable princess and dragon - slaying hero , @entity26 reverses their roles - offering readers powerful female and vulnerable male characters			1
in @entity26 's fantastical version @entity37 , for example , the heroine uses her golden - not glass - slippers to rescue her lover from beyond the moon			2
but his work , which also includes untold tales such as @entity44 and @entity45 , failed to attract the same attention as that of the @entity12 and faded into obscurity			1
many of the tales were told to him by peasants , labourers and servants , after being passed down through generations by word - of - mouth			2
he completed a book on his findings called @entity59 der @entity15 – @entity60 , which came out in three volumes			0
they included the fairy tales and historical background on them			0
girl power : while @entity28 fairytales often feature a vulnerable princess and dragon - slaying hero , @entity26 reverses their roles			1
above , the @entity12 fairytale @entity70 , shown in a 1829 sketch in 1885 , @entity28 said this about him : ' nowhere in the whole of @entity10 is anyone collecting [ folklore ] so accurately , thoroughly and with such a sensitive ear			1
' but @entity9 's volumes never gained prominence and were mostly forgotten			0
it was only when @entity81 , 80 , was sifting through @entity9 's work in an archive in @entity84 that his work re-emerged into the public domain			0
ms @entity81 , a retired teacher who now works as a cultural curator , moved to have the tales translated @entity24 and they will be published in a new @entity90 edition called @entity91			0
one story tells of a maiden who escapes a witch by transforming herself into a pond			2
the witch then lies on her stomach and drinks all the water , swallowing the young girl			0
but once she has drunk the pond , the girl uses a knife to cut her way out of the witch			0
in another , a woman gives her belongings to the poor but regains her wealth after she scares off a group of thieves			0
there are also more well - known but local examples of tales such as @entity37 and @entity116			2
ms @entity81 says the fairytales were invented for people of all ages			0
speaking about the books in 2012 , she said : ' their main purpose was to help young adults on their path to adulthood , showing them that dangers and challenges can be overcome through virtue , prudence and courage			0
