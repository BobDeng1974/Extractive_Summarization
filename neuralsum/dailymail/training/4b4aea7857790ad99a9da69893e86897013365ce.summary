the start of a new year means many @entity1 are taking up resolutions like working out regularly or starting a diet			0
but imagine committing yourself to abstain from one thing you really want , every day for the rest of your life			0
that 's what one @entity10 man is doing , by ignoring his physical attraction towards other men in order to adhere to his strict interpretation of @entity16			2
@entity17 , pastor of @entity18 , is so committed to his faith that he married a woman and the pious couple are expecting a baby in july			1
pictured above with his wife @entity26 ( left )			0
the couple are expecting a baby in july the 31 - year - old , who does n't consider himself gay , says he first noticed he was attracted to men in the mid- 90s			1
' it was a pretty immediate realization that it was in conflict with my faith , ' he told @entity36			0
he decided to be more open with his feelings when he started at @entity38 , though he feared he would be ostracized at the small @entity16 liberal arts school			0
surprisingly , @entity17 says he was overwhelmed by support			2
@entity17 considered joining a @entity16 denomination that accepted gays but ultimately decided against it since he could n't reconcile his fundamentalist beliefs with homosexuality			1
' i studied different methods of reading the scripture and it all came down to this : @entity51 accepts the rest of the scripture as divined from @entity54 , ' he told @entity36			0
' so if @entity51 is who he says he is , then we kind of have to believe what he believes			0
' acceptance : @entity17 first started feeling attractions toward men when he was an adolescent , but was n't open about his feelings until college			1
he says he was accepted at @entity38 , a small @entity16 liberal arts school in @entity10 @entity17 and his wife @entity62 first met each other at @entity16 summer camp , but only started dating several years later when they both applied to be the camp 's director			1
@entity62 got the job , and @entity17 later invited her to lunch when she was getting ready to leave the position			1
it was at that meeting that the two started falling in love , @entity17 said			2
' we got off talking about the job and started talking about our experience of the last couple years , ' @entity17 recalled			1
' i do n't want to be gushy or romantic , but i just melted inside , and thought , this is someone who understands graciousness			0
this is someone who understands acceptance , and this is someone i want to spend as much time with as possible			0
' @entity17 clarifies that even though he is attracted to men , does not mean he is not physically attracted to his wife			1
' i 'm not universally attracted to all men , nor am i universally attracted to all women			2
i am physically , emotionally , and spiritually attracted to my wife , ' he told @entity93			0
@entity17 adds that while physical attraction is important in a marriage , he believes it 's not the most important part and that sexual activity is ' best experienced in marriage between a man in a woman '			1
@entity62 knew about his attractions before marriage , and confesses that she was curious how it would impact their relationship			2
however , she now considers his attractions normal , comparing them to the same kind of temptations heterosexual couples experience in their own marriages			1
' there 's always going to be situations where a partner is sexually attracted to someone else and is n't necessarily dealing with sexual attraction with their partner , ' @entity62 said			1
@entity17 was just as forthcoming with these feelings when he first applied to the the pastor at @entity18			1
pious man : @entity17 is now the pastor at @entity18 in the western part of @entity10			1
he says he was open with his same - sex attractions through the interview process to be pastor at the church , and preaches about his own experiences on occasion ' the first question a congregant asked in my interview in front of the whole church was " what is your biggest struggle in life ? " and i shared this part of my story with the church , ' @entity17 told @entity93			2
' i preach on issues of sexuality when they come up in the scripture text that day , but it 's not a hobby horse of mine			0
' in the end , @entity17 says he believes his devotion to @entity54 is more important that his earthly desires towards men			2
' i think we all have part of our desires that we choose not to act on , right ? ' he said			0
' so for me , it 's not just that the religion was important to me , but communion with a @entity54 who loves me , who accepts me right where i am			0
' however , marriage is n't something that he recommends for all @entity16 men who experience the same same - sex feelings as himself			1
' i 'm blessed to have a couple friends who also experience same sex attraction and chose to marry , some who chose to remain celibate , and some who came to disagree with me and believe that there 's nothing wrong with their attraction and entered homosexual relationships			0
i can honestly say that all the @entity174 i know who experience same sex attraction have different ways of talking about their sexuality , sometimes in small nuances and shades , sometimes with significant differences , ' he told @entity93 .			0
