a new lawsuit has revealed the extent of former president @entity3 's friendship with a fundraiser who was later jailed for having sex with an underage prostitute			1
@entity3 's relationship with @entity9 , who served time in 2008 for his illegal sexual partners , included up multiple trips to the onetime billionaire 's private island in the @entity14 where underage girls were allegedly kept as sex slaves			1
the @entity17 has released new details about the two men 's friendship , which seems to have ended abruptly around the time of @entity9 's arrest			0
naming names : a lawsuit between @entity9 ( right , in 2011 ) and his legal team has included multiple mentions about the convicted pedophile 's connection to former president @entity3 ( left , earlier this month ) pedophile paradise : the lawsuit included flight records that showed @entity3 made multiple trips to @entity9 's private island , @entity34 ( pictured ) , between 2002 and 2005			1
women were reportedly kept there as sex slaves tales of orgies and young girls being shipped to the island , called @entity42 , have been revealed as part of an ongoing lawsuit between @entity9 and his former lawyers @entity45 and @entity47			1
it is unclear what the basis of the suit is , but they go on to call witness testimony from some of the frequent guests at @entity9 's island to talk about the wild parties that were held there in the early 2000s			0
convicted : @entity9 was investigated in 2005 after a woman reported that he paid her 14 - year - old daughter for sex flight logs pinpoint @entity3 's trips on @entity9 's jet between the years 2002 and 2005 , while he was working on his philanthropic post-presidential career and while his wife @entity68 was a senator for their adopted state of @entity70			1
' i remember asking @entity9 what 's @entity3 doing here kind fo thing , and he laughed it off and said well he owes me a favor , ' one unidentified woman said in the lawsuit , which was filed in @entity79			2
the woman went on to say how orgies were a regular occurrence and she recalled two young girls from @entity70 who were always seen around the five - house compound but their personal backstories were never revealed			0
at least one woman on the compound was there unwillingly , as the suit identifies a woman as @entity90 102			0
she ' was forced to live as one of @entity9 's underage sex slaves for years and was forced to have sex with ... politicians , businessmen , royalty , academicians , etc , ' the lawsuit says according to @entity17			1
@entity9 's sexual exploits have been documented since 2005 , when a woman in @entity79 contacted police saying that her 14 - year - old daughter had been paid $ 300 to massage him and then have sex			2
the claim prompted a nearly year - long investigation that led to the eventual charge of soliciting prostitution which came as part of a plea deal			0
he spent 13 months of a 18 - month sentence in jail and remains a registered sex offender			0
several of his famous friends cut ties - including @entity3 and then - @entity70 governor @entity116 who returned his campaign donations - but not all of them : prince @entity118 reportedly stayed at @entity9 's mansion in @entity70 in 2010 , months after he was released from jail			1
keeping ties : @entity3 was also friends with an unnamed woman who stored pictures of underage girls for @entity9 , and though @entity3 cut ties with @entity9 after his arrest , he invited the woman to @entity130 's 2010 wedding @entity3 's connection to @entity9 , who worked as a financier and education philanthropist before more than 40 women came forward with claims about him being a sexual predator , has been long - established , but @entity17 also tells how the former president was also friends with some of @entity9 's seedy acquaintances			1
the lawsuit claims that @entity3 was friends with an unnamed woman who ' kept images of naked underage children on her computer , helped to recruit underage children for @entity9 ... and photographed underage females in sexually explicit poses '			2
while he cut off ties with @entity9 , this woman 's abuses apparently did not end their relationship as she was reportedly one of the 400 guests at @entity153 's 2010 wedding			2
latest ladies : @entity3 was pictured posing for a photo with @entity156 ( left ) and @entity157 ( right ) , two known prostitutes who work at the @entity159 in @entity160 though the lawsuit may be bringing up sexual skeleton 's from @entity3 's past , he has added to the drama of late by posing for a photo with two known prostitutes at a fundraiser in @entity167 last month			0
the drama of his extramarital affairs is apparently just one concern for @entity3 family loyalists , as a @entity173 article released today details how ' i 'm not in the political camp ; i 'm in the friends camp			0
and the friends camp definitely has concerns about her running , ' the former secretary of state 's friend @entity177 told the paper ,			0

the former president was friends with @entity9 , a financier who was arrested in 2008 for soliciting underage prostitutes
a new lawsuit has revealed how @entity3 took multiple trips to @entity9 's private island where he ' kept young women as sex slaves '
@entity3 was also apparently friends with a woman who *collected* naked pictures of underage girls for @entity9 to choose from
he has *n't* cut ties with that woman , however , and invited her to @entity130 's wedding
comes as friends now fear that if @entity68 runs for president in 2016 , all of their family 's old *scandals* will be brought to the *forefront*
@entity9 has a host of famous friends including prince @entity118 who stayed at his @entity70 mansion after his arrest
