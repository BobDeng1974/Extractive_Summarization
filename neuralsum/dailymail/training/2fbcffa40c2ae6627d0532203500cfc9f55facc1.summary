these unusual structures - with their intricate designs and symmetrical forms - may look like they have been created by a 3d printer , but they are in fact more than a century old			1
displayed at the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , they are the artistic equivalent of a mathematical equation			1
according to the team that collected the designs , the structures reveal how mathematics can describe the world around us , even in its most complex forms			2
the unusual structures - with their intricate designs and symmetrical forms - may look like they have been created by a 3d printer , but they are in fact more than a century old the @entity17 is one of the most famous surfaces in mathematics			1
it was described by @entity22 in 1871			0
it is remarkable as it has exactly 27 straight lines that lie flush to its surface			0
the surface has three branches that join in a central column and in a flaring base			0
the 27 lines , etched in black , extend toward infinity			0
there are exactly 10 points on the structure ’s surface where three of the 27 lines meet			0
these points are called @entity42 points , and the @entity22 diagonal surface is the only cubic surface to contain them			0
@entity46 in @entity47 reports that the structures were created by @entity50 - based mathematician @entity49 and displayed in @entity51 in 1893			1
@entity6 , the @entity52 , @entity53 , and the @entity54 at @entity54 ordered a large collection of his models which are now on display			1
‘ digitally controlled 3d printers now produce such mathematical objects in exactly the same way as people did a century ago , ’ professor @entity58 from the @entity54 told @entity59			1
‘ both compute the data points from formulas , and build up the models , layer by layer like a wedding cake - but with thinner layers			2
’ @entity6 describes the structures as the artistic equivalent of a mathematical equation , designed to let algebra move away from the chalkboard and into physical form according to a report in @entity47 , the structures were created by @entity50 - based mathematician @entity49 and displayed in @entity51 in 1893 ‘ digitally controlled 3d printers now produce such mathematical objects in exactly the same way as people did a century ago , ’ professor @entity58 from the @entity54 told @entity59			1
the @entity22 diagonal is described by mr @entity46 in @entity47 as one of the most beautiful models in the catalogue			2
the symmetrical cubic equation was described by @entity22 in 1871 and is remarkable as it has exactly 27 straight lines that lie flush to its surface			2

there are exactly 10 points on the structure ’s surface where three of the 27 lines meet			0
‘ making them is perhaps the most abstract art of all , in that they express in a real , touchy - feely way , ideas that initially exist purely in the mathematical mind , ' said professor @entity58 @entity6 , the @entity52 , @entity53 , and the @entity54 at @entity54 ordered a large collection of these models which now adorn their hallways these points are called @entity42 points , and the @entity22 diagonal surface is the only cubic surface to contain them			1
the maths models were discovered by @entity118 - based @entity117 while researchers were cleaning the models during a move of their cases many years ago			1
to build the model , workers in @entity49 ’s laboratory drew the horizontal sections solving a planar version of the equation			1
each cross-section was cast separately , in a plaster made from powdered chalk			0
the layers were then stacked , glued together , and sanded until they were smooth			0

this symmetrical cubic equation , pictured here in physical form , was described by @entity22 in 1871 and is remarkable as it has exactly 27 straight lines that lie flush to its surface to build the model , workers in @entity49 ’s laboratory drew the horizontal sections solving a planar version of the equation each cross-section was cast separately , in a plaster made from powdered chalk			1
the layers were then stacked , glued together , and sanded until they were smooth to create a final design ( pictured )			0

the structures were created by @entity50 - based @entity49 in 1893
