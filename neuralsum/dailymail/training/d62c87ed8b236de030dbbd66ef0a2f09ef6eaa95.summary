by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:52 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 10:42 est , 7 august 2013 researchers have been given the go - ahead to exhume dozens of bodies of boys believed to have been abused and killed at a closed - down reform school			1
@entity8 's cabinet has approved a year - long dig for human remains at the @entity11 , in @entity12 , in the north west of the state			1
investigators are trying to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths , which experts say probably occurred between 1914 and 1952			0
horrors : crosses mark graves at a cemetery at @entity11 for boys in @entity12 , @entity8			1
investigators have said they have found at least 50 graves on the grounds scene : former students spoke out several years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in this mausoleum - like building dubbed the ' @entity34 ' investigation : researchers believe that 96 boys died at the school and expect to find more burial sites state officials have for years insisted that 31 boys were interred in a tiny cemetery on the grounds of the notorious reform school			1
but recent scans , using high - tech search equipment , have found evidence of at least another 19 bodies buried under the site - and forensic scientists fear there could be many more			1
now , thanks to an approved land use agreement with the @entity54 , the @entity55 can send in a team to search for unaccounted bodies and to try to establish what exactly went on at the former reform school			1
quoted in the @entity60 , @entity61 , a @entity8 cabinet member and attorney general who voted to secure access for a dig , said : ' we 're not exactly sure what happened there , but we know it was n't good			1
' we have to look at our history			0
we have to go back , we know there are unmarked graves currently on that property that deserve a proper burial			2
it 's the right thing to do			0
' the news will come as some relief to relatives of the boys and researchers who have faced barriers with their investigation , including a temporary restraining order issued by a county circuit judge in october 2012 , and opposition by some @entity86 residents who fear social and economic effects in the possible wake of any findings of a dig. @entity91 , publisher of the @entity92 , wrote on august 1 : ' the bad publicity which will ensue during the year or more of time which will be involved will seriously hamper our local tourism development programs , as well as economic development efforts for our county			1
' he urged officials not allow researchers to further investigate the case , which he said was motivated by ' greed ' and was a ' waste of money '			2
@entity61 , the attorney general who voted to secure access for a dig , said : ' we 're not exactly sure what happened there , but we know it was n't good ' institution : @entity113 was opened as a state reform school in january 1900 for misbehaving boys treatment : the boys were allegedly forced into hard labour , while others were beaten , raped or killed culture : a memorial or burial service around 1950			1
more than 20 students ' burials were undocumented in december , researchers from the @entity55 , in @entity126 , said they found evidence of at least 50 graves on the school 's property			1
they also found more grave shafts in and around an area called ' @entity133 ' , which rises across a major highway from the high , razor - wire - topped fences of the closed school			1
there could be even more victims , but researchers do not have access to records after 1960 because of privacy laws , and overgrowth on the grounds has hindered them from full searches			2
some died under unknown circumstances , according to relatives			0
' we really do n't know exactly how many , or who they are , ' said @entity151 , a forensic anthropologist at the @entity55			1
she has a scroll - like map of spots around the school 's grounds where her ground - piercing radar has spotted evidence of human remains			1
the @entity11 was legend among adolescents for about 100 years in @entity8 , as the state 's major reform school , until it was closed in 2011			1
discovery : @entity55 radar research shows burial sites do not correspond with the crosses former students spoke out several years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in a mausoleum - like building dubbed the ' @entity34 ' where nine barren cubicles held boys accused of rule breaking			1
dr @entity151 said : ' all the focus on exact numbers is not really the issue			0
' whether it 's one or 20 or 40 or 60 , we are talking about a child and families that are asking for information			0
' @entity11 was closed in june 2011 by the @entity186 after a years - long controversy over widespread physical and sexual abuse			1
in 2009 , writer @entity189 published the @entity190 detailing the horrors he experienced while incarcerated at @entity11			2
he was sent to the reform school in 1959 when he was 12 , and suffered brutal , bloody beatings in the infamous @entity34 building			1
' little did i know that @entity196 had its own concentration camp for little boys right here in the good ole @entity196 , ' he wrote			2
' a devil was hiding behind every tree , every building and even behind every blade of manicured grass			0
' he writes on his website : ' the terrible screams i heard and the brutal beatings i witnessed as a 12 year old will remain in my memory forever			2
' the beatings i suffered are not my horrors today			0
my horrors are the beatings of crying boys that i had to witness before my own beatings			2
the horror of knowing that i was next			2
' the thick concrete walls and the loud industrial fan easily muffled the horrible screams of the boys as they were beaten bloody			2
some were carried to the hospital in wheelbarrows and some had to have their underwear or pajamas surgically removed from the buttocks			0
' for almost thirty minutes , at age sixty - two , i stood alone in the exact room where i was almost beaten to death			2
with my heart racing and the side of my neck pulsating , i lit a cigarette and i cried without feeling shame			0
' previous investigations and lawsuits have been brought by the ' @entity11 ' - so called because of the name of the squat , whitewashed building where much of the abuse took place			1
a group of former students sued the state in 2010 , but their case was dismissed as the statute of limitations had expired			2
other students have written books about their experiences			0
following the claims , researchers at the @entity55 used ground - penetrating radar and soil samples and now believe there are many more bodies buried there than previously reported			1
the largest gravesite is on the north side of the campus , where @entity260 boys were buried			0
it is at this site where the 31 graves are marked with white crosses , but researchers believe they do not correspond with actual burial sites			1
' we anticipated finding about 25 to 30 grave shafts , ' said @entity268 , an assistant professor of anthropology who led the anthropological work at the site			0
' but in fact we found a minimum of 50			0
' @entity113 's own records show that more than 50 children were buried on the grounds , while more than 30 other bodies were sent elsewhere to be buried			0
but the school failed to record burial locations for 22 other children who researchers learned died on the site , the @entity277 reported in december			1
some of the children - and two adults - died in a fire and influenza outbreak in the early 1900s , while others were reported to have suffered from ill health or physical traumas			2
the @entity196 @entity291 has a programme that could provide up to $ 3million for a thorough forensic sifting of the burial areas , said @entity196 senator @entity295 , a @entity296			0
a $ 200,000 appropriation is already pending in the state legislature			0
mr @entity295 said he wants to find out as much as possible and let relatives know the truth			0
he noted that ' the statute of limitation on murder never runs out , ' but added there is little chance of prosecuting anyone			0
state attorney @entity307 said only one or two employees from the era are known to be alive , and it 's unlikely a trial could prove how a boy died or who was responsible			0
' the question is , can we establish probable cause that a crime has been committed , and who did it ? ' he said			0
' that 's the hard part			0
' families could ask their legislators to file ' claims ' bills for civil compensation , if identity could be established from remains and if negligence might be established on the part of the state			0
school grounds : scientists believe there are bodies buried in wooded areas and unmarked graves ongoing : the @entity196 @entity291 has a programme that could provide up to $ 3million for a thorough forensic sifting of the burial areas , said @entity196 senator @entity295 , a @entity296			1

@entity11 , @entity8 , opened as a reform school in 1900 but was closed in 2011 amid decades - long allegations of physical and sexual abuse
now state officials have agreed to a year - long forensic investigation into the site , *meaning* dozens of boys ' graves will be exhumed
the @entity8 @entity351 *decision* came after researchers from the @entity55 discovered evidence of dozens of unmarked , secret graves
*survivors* have spoken of ' horror stories ' that happened at the school
