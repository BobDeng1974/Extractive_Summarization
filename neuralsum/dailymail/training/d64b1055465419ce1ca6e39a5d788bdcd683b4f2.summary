ever wondered about some of the three letter airport codes across the world ? while some are clearly obvious , others just leave us scratching our heads			1
but airport codes are more than just three randomly assigned letters stuck to your luggage			1
these little abbreviations are telling us exactly where we are flying around the world			0
while some make perfect sense for example @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , they 're all pretty simple - @entity21 , @entity22 , per , the first three letters of each city 's name			1
this airport code is pretty easy just @entity22 the @entity34 ( pictured )			2
the ones that make perfect sense , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , they 're all pretty simple - @entity21 , @entity22 , per , the first three letters of each city 's name			1
and you 'd think it would be just as simple for every other airport to follow , but not so			2
@entity43 had to ditch the @entity44 in favour of @entity46 because it was already taken by an airport in the @entity49 city of @entity50 , according to the @entity52 @entity51			0
unfortunately the easy selection of @entity54 had to be avoided because it was assigned to the @entity55 which is now abandoned			0
and in some cases the tricky airport code skips a letter or two just like @entity60 's @entity59 and @entity62 's @entity61 or in @entity64 's case ( @entity65 ) picking a few from both words			1
@entity68 ( pictured ) has a fairly simple airport code @entity59 , skipping just one letter @entity46 @entity46 ( pictured ) @entity43 had to ditch the @entity44 in favour of @entity46 because it was already taken by an airport in the @entity49 city of @entity50 but here comes the more cryptic codes , that leave us asking the question , why ? almost every traveller usually understands the @entity79 code which stands for the famous @entity79 airport - but have you ever wondered where that @entity82 comes from ? according to @entity52 @entity51 it 's a remnant from the early days of air travel when airports were referred to by a two letter ' weather station ' code			1
when the growth of air travel created the need for three - letter codes , the airport ’s original designation had an ‘ x ’ amended to ease the transition , as did @entity97 ( @entity98 )			1
@entity101 , @entity100 took the code @entity102 so that meant that @entity105 had to import the ' x ' to make it @entity107 , only really to fill out the three characters			0
in other cases across the world , the airport codes take the first letter of the city 's name followed by two letters for the airport itself			1
@entity119 , @entity118 is @entity118 while one of the countries other main airports @entity120 is @entity120			0
or to really throw a spanner in the works , and getting rid of the @entity127 altogether , the @entity124 airport is tagged as @entity124 , slightly confusing			0
@entity118 ( pictured ) @entity118			0
in @entity119 the airport codes take the first letter of the city 's name followed by two letters for the airport itself @entity134 airport in @entity135 ( pictured ) @entity134 is @entity136			1
it represents the old anglicised name of @entity134 which was changed to @entity134 after the establishment of the @entity135 in 1949 in @entity141 , old school sometimes takes preference			0
@entity134 is in fact @entity136			2
it represents the old anglicised name of @entity134 which was changed to @entity134 after the establishment of the @entity135 in 1949			0
in the @entity146 , @entity145 is also stepping back in time with its code @entity147 while officially known as the @entity149 , the original @entity149 field strip was adjacent to a small farming community called @entity152 , which was taken by the airport			2
and you 'd be excused for thinking wtf when you arrive in @entity156 with all of the nation 's airport codes beginning with the letter @entity160 in the early days of broadcast radio the @entity162 market was divided into three geographic zones , each carrying a regional - specific letter to be used in front of a station 's callsign			1
@entity52 @entity51 says the @entity146 stations were assigned @entity171 if they were located east of the @entity172 and @entity173 if they were west of the mighty @entity172			0
all radio stations in @entity156 got @entity175 so you 've got @entity176 ( @entity177 ) and @entity178 ( @entity179 )			0
@entity181 airport in @entity156 ( pictured ) oh @entity156 ! @entity181 's appellation of @entity183 is more of a puzzler , and came about because @entity185 was already assigned as @entity181 ’s generic region code and even when we go closer to home , the airport codes get a little crazy for thought			1
the proposed @entity191 at @entity192 has already been christened as @entity193			1
and there 's even the slightly funny ones , that might send out a chuckle			0
has anyone flown to @entity198 ? the airport code for @entity200 , @entity201			2
apparently the airport has made fun of its unfortunate name selling a variety of @entity198 souvenirs			0
but the more unfortunate ones are these			0
@entity209 's @entity208 is stuck with @entity210 , while the number 2 version goes to @entity213 's @entity212 with @entity214			1
there 's even one for @entity216 , the airport code for @entity218 , @entity219			2

airport codes are more than just three random letters
perfect sense : @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 - @entity21 , @entity22 , per
airport codes that skips a letter : @entity59 , @entity61
the ' x ' is a remnant from early days of travel when airport only had a two letter code
old school references : @entity136 , @entity149
the proposed @entity191 at @entity192 has already been christened as @entity193
@entity209 's @entity208 code is @entity210 , @entity213 's @entity212 code is @entity214
