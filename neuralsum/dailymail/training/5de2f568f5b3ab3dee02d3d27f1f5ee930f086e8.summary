embarrassing : while en route to @entity11 for her 2006 honeymoon , @entity5 found she was too fat for the seatbelt all gone : @entity5 says the experience was so humiliating , she returned determined to lose weight ' we would eat ready meals every day , and loads of takeaways , i loved a trip to the chippy or a @entity34 meal			1
' the lowest point was for my honeymoon to @entity11 , i got on the plane and sat in my seat , but when i picked up the belt i realised it would not fit around my stomach			0
' i tried and tried but it would not go , i realised there were people staring at me , it was so embarrassing for me			0
' i had to call the stewardess , and they had to bring me an extender normally given to pregnant woman or parents who have children on their laps			2

' they meant i could still enjoy all my favourites and lose weight			0
it was great to be able to eat the same as my family and friends instead of having to have a separate diet dinner , too , so they ’ve benefited from eating more healthily without even trying			0
