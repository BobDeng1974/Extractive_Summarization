@entity0 really is something special			2
not only does it succeed in offering unparalleled levels of creative choice but it 's a wonderful homage to some of their much - loved characters			1
using a similar mechanic to the @entity10 games , an @entity7 is plugged into the console and figurines are placed on one of three slots			2
as with @entity10 , they are rigid and ca n't be moved - but the attention to detail is astounding			2
in the @entity19 , you get @entity20 , @entity21 and mr @entity22 and all ooze the charm that made them such favourites with fans			2
even @entity21 , arguably the hardest of the three to capture given he was played by @entity28 and not a @entity30 concoction , exudes that clumsy , cocky swagger			0
it 's a shame that the voice actor does n't quite nail him as a character			1
out of this world : @entity0 is at its best in @entity39 mode , where all your favourite characters can interact after the magical introduction , the game is split into two areas - the @entity39 mode and @entity45			1
the latter represents @entity0 's character specific campaign mode - but do n't expect a bunch tedious mini games			1
each character 's story lasts for around 4 hours and ranges from battles on the high sea with @entity21 to open - world robot smashing with mr @entity22 in @entity57			0
but it 's @entity59 that steals the show - a stealth action game where you have to wreck havoc on the rival campus @entity65 combat is helped along by responsive controls , even though when you 're knocked down , getting back up again is a tad slow			0
in a way , it 's a shame characters from other universes ca n't join in on the fun - but it 's understandable , given how true to the source material @entity76 want to be			1
fear not , though , as the @entity39 mode goes some way to resolve this			1
not only can you build new worlds , but you can design your own games , too			0
want to race a custom car around @entity83 as @entity21 ? you can			0
and @entity0 's clever tutorial system makes the process as easy as possible			0
there 's even a clever magic wand that let 's you manipulate the environment on the fly - literally allowing you to move mountains at the touch of a button			0
fitting , given that @entity0 has carved its own , beautiful mark on the gaming @entity94 will point out that some classic characters - such as @entity97 - should be included			1
@entity98 : graphics may not push consoles , but they capture the essence of each world and character perfectly regardless , @entity0 remains a magical experience for children and adults alike , and an enjoyable celebration of their more contemporary creations			1
let us know what you think on @entity112 : @ @entity113 and on @entity114 : @entity115 .			0
