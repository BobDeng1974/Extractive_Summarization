scientists at @entity1 have hacked a pair of sandals which they claim will allow people to ' hear themselves happy ' forget meditation and self - help books , the key to a happy life could be down to the sounds you hear			1
scientists in @entity12 have hacked a pair of sandals which they claim will allow people to ' hear themselves happy '			1
the sandals link to headphones which change the sound of each footstep to gradually make a person feel lighter			1
volunteers who wore the sandals said they felt slimmer , with longer legs and looser knees			1
they also reported feeling happier and more energised			1
the shoes were created by @entity28 at @entity1 's @entity29			1
' it would give the same benefits as the sandals when walking or running , perhaps in the gym to feel lighter and more motivated , ' ms @entity28 said in an interview with @entity36			1
' we are finding that sound is affecting not just the perception of our body shape but our physical capabilities			1
understand these sounds and we could change our feelings in a positive way			0
' the sandals exploit a phenomenon called ' predictive coding ' in which the brain makes decisions based on past experience			1
ms @entity28 explained that if the sensory feedback you get is not what you were expecting you update your predictions			0
technology such as this could help people with as body dysmorphia , where a mental illness makes them unable to see themselves correctly			0
scroll down to watch the video and try the experiment yourself during the test , a participant was asked to run her finger across a strip of smooth plastic ( pictured )			1
as she moved her hand , headphones played the sound of a finger moving across different surfaces			1
experts believe that auditory changes confuse and disrupt the brain , and this creates a mismatch between the senses ' something that enhances runner 's perception would be very popular , ' sports engineer @entity85 at @entity86 told the @entity87			0
in a separate experiment in particular , ms @entity28 proved that sounds can trick the brain into thinking they 're touching a variety of different surfaces			0
during the test , reported in @entity36 , a participant was asked to run her finger across a strip of smooth plastic			1
as she moved her hand , headphones played the sound of a finger moving across paper , sandpaper and velvet			1
when the sound of a finger moving across sandpaper ( stock image left ) and velvet ( right ) were played , the participant reported noticeable changes in how the plastic felt beneath her finger			1
researchers want to study how sounds can be manipulated to affect a person 's mood and perception the participant reported noticeable changes in how the plastic felt beneath her finger after each sound			1
dr @entity119 believes that auditory changes confuse and disrupt the brain , and creates a mismatch between the senses			2
this is a similar experience people get when viewing optical illusions			0
in the case of optical illusions , colour , light and patterns are used to create images that deceive or mislead the brain			0
the information collected by the eye is processed by the brain			0
in the process of converting what it sees , the brain tries to make sense of the different colours and patterns			2
this creates a perception that does n't match the image , and confuses the brain			0
similarly , in terms of audio changes , the information collected by the ear is processed by the brain , which then tries to make sense of the differences			2
as the brain tries to account for discrepancies , it produces a variety of sensations			0
as part of the project , dr @entity160 also studies how auditory information generated by the human body affects how that person comes across , and how people see them			1
' this mental representation we have of our bodies is essential for successful interaction with the environment , ' explained dr @entity160			2
previous studies have highlighted the role that sight , touch and a person 's own perception - known as proprioception - play in representation			2
but , the effect sounds have on these senses and experiences have n't been investigated in depth			0
' interestingly , the sounds that accompany almost every bodily movement are highly rich in information about the body and the space immediately surrounding it , ' continued dr @entity160			2
she used the example that the sounds produced when tapping on a surface tells people about the length and strength of their arm			0
dr @entity197 believes that auditory changes confuse and disrupt the brain , and creates a mismatch between the senses			2
this is similar to the experience people have when viewing optical illusions			0

the sensations are similar to those experience when people watch optical illusions ( pictured )			0
in the case of optical illusions , colour , light and patterns are used to create images that deceive or mislead the brain			0
the information collected by the senses processed by the brain , which then tries to make sense of it in another experiment , the pitch created by a person 's footsteps was made higher or lower			1
when lower , the footsteps produced a sound that suggested the person was heavier than they were			1
this caused participants to report that their legs felt heavier and the steps felt laboured			0
higher pitches made people feel lighter			1

scientists at @entity1 linked sandals to headphones
they changed sound of each footstep to make a person feel lighter
volunteers who wore sandals said they felt happy and more *energetic*
as part of same study , a participant ran her finger across smooth plastic
headphones played sound of finger across paper , sandpaper and velvet
the participant reported noticeable changes in how the plastic felt
the tests were devised by dr @entity302 for her @entity29 project at the @entity304
