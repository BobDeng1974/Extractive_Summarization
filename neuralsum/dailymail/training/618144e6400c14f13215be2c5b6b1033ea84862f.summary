research shows that one in every six people who use a solarium has a greater risk of melanoma than those who do not use it			1

‘ educate people on uv light and encourage them to speak to their doctors and do mandatory skin checks every year – this is something we ’ve been highly promoting to our clients			0
‘ we have well - trained staff here who tell our clients “ how much is too much ” and we make sure they wear enough sunscreen if they ’re going to be outdoors			0
‘ we know too much uv is not good and our sessions usually run between four minutes to a maximum of 16 and we always top it up with spray tan when our clients request to be darker			0
