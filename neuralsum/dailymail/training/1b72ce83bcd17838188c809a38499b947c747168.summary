@entity0 will enter the final day of the @entity1 with a four - shot lead after an excellent seven - under - par 65 in his third round in @entity4			1
the @entity5 made a sensational start to his round with five consecutive birdies from the second and although he dropped a couple of shots on the seventh and 13th , he went birdie - par - eagle - birdie on his final four holes			1
' four - shot lead makes me a little comfortable for sunday , but i do n't think about a win , ' @entity0 said on the @entity18 website			1
@entity0 hits off from the third fairway of the @entity20 during the third round of @entity1 open @entity0 , whose only victory on the @entity18 came last may at the @entity23 , held his nerve in the closing stages to hole a couple of clutch putts			2
a magnificent 15 - footer on the last took him to 16 - under for the tournament , which gives him a comfortable cushion over nearest challenger @entity32			2
the @entity33 , who only earned his @entity18 card three weeks ago , has given himself an outside chance of reeling in @entity37 after his 69 , which featured five birdies and two bogeys			0
' it 's been a pretty crazy four or five months , but it 's been great , ' @entity32 said			0
@entity0 follows his drive from the fourth tee during the third round of the competition in @entity4 overnight leader @entity47 from @entity48 fell back among a number of players five shots adrift of @entity0 following a disappointing 71 on saturday			1
the 31 - year - old @entity52 has taken seven weeks off the @entity18 and looked to be back with a bang after two 67s in his opening two rounds but he was in patchy form in his third round			0
@entity33 trio @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 are also on 11 - under while compatriot @entity63 , @entity65 's @entity64 , @entity67 's @entity66 and @entity69 's @entity68 are a shot further back .			0

@entity0 has a four - shot lead going into the final day of the @entity1 in @entity4
an *impressive* showing of seven - under - par 65 puts the @entity5 in a *strong* position now
@entity0 *insists* he feel comfortable *ahead* of the final day of the competition on sunday , but is n't thinking about a win yet
