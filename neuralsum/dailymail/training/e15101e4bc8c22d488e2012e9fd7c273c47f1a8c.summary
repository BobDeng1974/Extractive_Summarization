by @entity0 published : 08:26 est , 14 may 2012 updated : 09:08 est , 14 may 2012 it might sound like a recipe for disaster - or at the very least an impromptu barbecue - but the latest weapon against cows ' methane emissions is a laser beam			1
professor @entity9 will not be aiming the energy weapon at cows ' rear ends , however - instead , he aims to use methane to measure how much methane cow flatulence emits into the atmosphere			0
‘ this is a critical step if we are to help agriculture reduce its emissions because if you ca n’t measure , you ca n’t mitigate , ’ professor @entity9 said			2
professor @entity9 will not be aiming the energy weapon at cows ' rear ends , however - instead , he aims to use methane to measure how much methane cow flatulence emits into the atmosphere @entity27 agriculture directly accounts for 10 % of the country ’s overall greenhouse gas emissions - and a new research collaboration called the @entity31 aims to reduce that impact			1
@entity9 's research has shown that simple addition of inhibitors to manure and soil can reduce emissions by up to 80 % the collaboration , led by researchers from the @entity41 , aims to improve measurement and management of methane emissions for the grazing lands of northern @entity27 thought to be responsible for five per cent of the country ’s overall greenhouse gas emissions			1
led by associate professor @entity9 ( phd 1996 ) from the @entity49 , the team is the first in @entity27 to accurately measure livestock emissions using laser and infrared spectroscopy systems			1
results show the average methane emission is much lower than estimates currently used in @entity27 , but the average ammonia emission is substantially @entity58 says ‘ you can only find ways to reduce greenhouse gases if you can reliably measure them ’			2
by sending a beam of light through the air , scientists can measure concentrations of methane , nitrous oxide and ammonia in the atmosphere			0
the beams are bounced back from a reflector and the particles in that area detected			0
emissions are then calculated using a computer model to work out the origin of particles in the @entity80 work has spurred new research into the use of inhibitors that can be applied to manure and soil to reduce emissions			2
preliminary results indicate emissions can be reduced by up to 80 per cent and the efficiency of nitrogen fertilisers significantly improved			0
@entity9 's method involves measuring methane emissions using lasers and spectroscopy ( file picture ) @entity95 , dr @entity96 , said , ‘ the @entity98 ’s @entity97 sets a long - term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent of 2000 levels by the year 2050			1
' this research will help identify field - based measurement techniques and protocols that can support management actions and technologies that can help @entity27 meet such ambitious targets			0
’ ‘ the cluster will also develop science that supports methodology development for the @entity126 , an @entity27 government program that enables farmers to earn ‘ carbon credits ’ for undertaking abatement activities on their properties , ’ dr @entity109 ’s @entity108 will fund the cluster for over three years , with support from several other @entity27 universities including @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity117 as well as researchers at @entity119 and @entity120 and the @entity122 devices more than their own toys.1			0

10 % of @entity27 's methane emissions come from agriculture
laser spectroscopy used to measure methane emissions
figure lower than *expected*
additives to manure and soil can reduce emissions by up to 80 %
