it could be football 's greatest ever dynasty – @entity2 as @entity4 's head coach and his four sons out on the pitch in the famous white shirts playing for him			1
it sounds far - fetched , but then so does the idea that @entity2 could be @entity4 's b - team coach and that his offspring would be at various levels of the club 's youth system – which is already a reality			1
@entity16 looks at the chances of things going to the next level			0
videos scroll down to watch @entity20 prove he 's a chip off the old block @entity2 is currently @entity4 's b - team coach and could replace @entity24 at the @entity25 @entity2 enjoyed a glittering career as a player at @entity4 and his sons are all currently at the academy the coach @entity2 has spent three days in @entity31 this week under the tutelage of @entity33 and @entity4 are hoping that what the teacher did for @entity36 the pupil will one day do for them			1
@entity40 president @entity39 has decided he wants the former player to lead the side one day and @entity2 is preparing for the possibility that it could come as soon as next season			1
he is one of seven @entity46 coaches spending this week at @entity48 's training facilities where along with former @entity4 team - mate @entity50 he is seeing first hand how @entity33 works			1
next season he could be in the same position @entity33 was in 2008 – having graduated from his club 's youth system to take charge of the first team			2
he will cut the same sharp - suited imposing figure on the touchline and he will command the same respect among rivals , players and media , but will he be as prolifically successful ? @entity2 visited @entity48 's training ground with @entity64 ( left ) and @entity50 ( right ) this week real hope @entity2 can emulate @entity33 's transition from a player to boss with @entity36 and @entity48 @entity2 currently coaches @entity4 's second team , @entity69 , in one of @entity72 's four regional third - tier divisions			1
if @entity69 win their division they will go into a play - off for a place in the second division next season			2
but by then @entity24 may have moved on and @entity2 may have stepped up to replace him			0
there is no question a career as a coach is what the former @entity82 and @entity83 winner wants			0
as well as this week 's masterclass with @entity33 he has also been to @entity86 to watch @entity88 work			0
he wants to coach the @entity90 team one day and if their 2016 campaign on home soil were to end in tears there would be calls for him to take charge of the national side he once lead to the biggest prize in football			2
the @entity4 job will probably come before the national team however			2
those who have seen him at close quarters on the training pitch say he 's inspirational and has none of that haughtiness that sometimes prevents great players from being able to improve lesser mortals			0
@entity2 lead @entity90 to @entity83 glory in 1998 and is touted as a future national team coach with @entity2 in charge , @entity4 's @entity69 team are in one of @entity72 's four regional third - tier divisions zidane fights for the ball with @entity119 's @entity118 during a @entity121 tie in 2003 he 's tough and media - savvy after years of coping with the intense spotlight shone on him in @entity90 where he is adored far more than @entity124 – his rival as the country 's greatest ever player , but one who never won the @entity83			1
ultimately expecting him to emulate @entity33 might be asking too much – the @entity48 coach 's tactical brain and obsessive character make him unique			2
he also has the baggage of having been so good as a player			0
@entity134 and @entity135 never made it as managers , but @entity138 and @entity139 did , so there are precedents			0
@entity139 was a fine player and also excelled as a manager at @entity36 and the sons … @entity144 star of @entity146 , @entity147 , wears the @entity149 name on his back , the family name of the @entity2 boys ' mother @entity152 – a dancer who he met in 1988 playing for @entity155			1
it perhaps weighs less heavily on the shoulders of the young prodigies			0
already a @entity72 under 19 international @entity144 , just like his siblings , has the choice of three countries			0
playing for @entity90 would please his father ; and so might playing for @entity163 , which is his third possibility because of his grandfather			0
he is the player who most resembles his father in playing style			0
he plays as a no 10 and is one rung on the ladder below @entity69			2
@entity149 is the star of @entity146 and is already a @entity72 under 19 international @entity144 's style as a gifted @entity172 with @entity4 's lower ranks most resembles that of his father @entity175 @entity144 is very much the @entity46 romantics ' choice to make it – being named after @entity180 playmaker @entity179 and playing in @entity2 's position			1
but many in @entity90 believe it will be goalkeeper @entity175 – born just before his father won the @entity83 in 1998 – who will go further			2
he currently plays for @entity4 's @entity185 team and is impressing everyone at the club			1
@entity188 has impressed at @entity4 as a goalkeeper while @entity190 ( right ) struggles @entity2 watches a @entity192 boxing match with son @entity175 in @entity193 in 2007 @entity20 and @entity194 @entity2 's youngest sons have both grown up in @entity72			1
@entity194 has recently turned 10 and is a midfielder and @entity20 is also a midfielder who will be 13 in may			1
they are both in @entity4 boys ' teams and in theory they would both also have the option of playing for @entity72 , @entity90 or @entity163 if they reached international levels			2
if all four sons made it to international football and did n't pick the same country , they could even replicate the situation at the last @entity83 when the @entity212 brothers @entity210 and @entity213 faced each other for @entity215 and @entity216			0
@entity194 ( left , 10 ) and @entity20 ( right , 12 ) are both in @entity4 boys ' teams and could play for @entity72 , @entity90 or @entity163 @entity218 ( right , ) scored a superb goal @entity4 's youth side after a wonderful left - footed touch he placed the ball past the goalkeeper as three defenders tried to close down the space around him will the @entity2 dynasty become a reality at the @entity228 ? it 's impossible to say how the youngest two will develop but the eldest are well on their way to becoming professionals			1
can they do it at @entity4 with @entity2 as their footballing as well as natural father ? @entity237 has to get the big job first , then the boys are in the realms of ' famous footballers with famous footbaling fathers as manager ' syndrome			1
@entity245 and @entity246 did n't match the achievements of their coaching dads but did make good careers for themselves			0
it is always tough for the sons of great players			0
@entity135 's son , @entity254 , served @entity255 as a goalkeeper but also served time for drugs and money - laundering offences			0
@entity134 is one of the world 's greatest ever players but son @entity261 ( right ) failed to impress @entity246 ( right ) tried to emulate father @entity139 and briefly featured for @entity119 and when @entity134 's son , @entity262 , was playing youth football at @entity264 , an @entity266 journalist was overheard assessing the boy 's chances of emulating his father and saying : ' if you threw @entity134 an orange he 'd catch it on his foot , juggle it and balance it on his head			1
if you threw his son an orange he 'd catch it in his hands , peel it and eat it			0
' @entity2 's children clearly have the talent to follow their father 's footsteps and with their dad on the verge of a managerial career at @entity4 the possibilities of a ' @entity286 ' can not be ruled out			1
@entity2 scores a spectacular goal against @entity288 during the 2002 @entity121 final			0

@entity2 is currently the @entity4 b - team ( @entity69 ) coach
@entity39 wants former star to be manager at @entity4 in the future
@entity2 has four sons - @entity144 , @entity175 , @entity20 and @entity194 all playing at the club
@entity144 is a no 10 like his father while @entity175 is an impressive goalkeeper
it could be football 's greatest ever dynasty if all four make it in the game
