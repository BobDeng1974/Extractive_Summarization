ms @entity20 had previously told the press that the burglar got away with a necklace containing a strand of hair belonging to her 19 - year - old son , @entity77 , who was killed in a car crash in 2006			1
‘ it was kind of odd , ’ @entity59 said , of his conversations with the purported burglar			0

the alarm is set , and i 'm having more lights and cameras installed			0

'' it appears the thief gained entrance by using a glass cutter to get into the bathroom violated : @entity20 has compared the break in to feeling of being ' raped ' ' the third floor houses all my furs and big hats , you come down the spiral staircase to the second floor which is where i get my hair and make up done , it also houses all the shoes from @entity339 and @entity340 , to my tennis and work out gear , ' she said			1
' then you come down a floating staircase , which is just magical , and the first floor is where you pick out your jewelry and bags , ' she continued , noting that it typically takes her 45 minutes to get ready			0
in fact , the closet even features a champagne bar - perfect for hosting events to benefit charitable causes			0
