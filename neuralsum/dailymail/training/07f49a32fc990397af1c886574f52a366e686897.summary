by @entity0 published : 16:37 est , 10 november 2012 updated : 08:46 est , 11 november 2012 it is rapidly becoming tradition at this time of year for men to sprout moustaches as part of the increasingly popular @entity7 charity campaign			1
but the latest fundraiser to let their facial hair grow wild in the name of a good cause is a 36 - year - old woman			1
@entity15 , 36 , who suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome and has spent years trying to hide her facial hair , has ditched her clippers for the month of november to grow a moustache and beard for charity			1
good cause : @entity15 has spent her life trying to hide her facial hair , but has ditched the clippers to raise money for charity as part of the @entity7 campaign the @entity7 campaign encourages men to quit shaving for the month of november to raise awareness and funds for men 's health - specifically prostate cancer and testicular cancer			1
mrs @entity15 , who usually shaves every other day , is already sporting a wispy beard and the beginnings of a moustache after deciding to take part			2
having struggled with facial hair since puberty , the housewife was finally diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome ( @entity43 ) 12 years ago when she and her husband @entity44 struggled to conceive			1
inspiring : mrs @entity15 said growing her facial hair would be worth it if it encouraged just one man to get a life - saving health check mrs @entity15 said the problem had driven her to depression in the past , but that she was prepared to overcome her embarassment if it meant more men would address potentially life - threatening health issues			2
polycystic ovary syndrome ( @entity43 ) , is a hormonal imbalance in which women ’s ovaries produce excessive amounts of the male hormone testosterone			1
this results in the formation of small harmless cysts on the ovaries			0
excessive hair growth - known as hirsutism - is just one of the symptoms of the condition , alongside erratic periods , weight gain , acne , and fertility problems			2
the condition , which affects one in ten @entity73 women , should not be confused with polycystic ovaries , which merely describes the appearance of small cysts on the ovaries			0
roughly 20 per cent of women have this condition with no effects at all and no problems conceiving			0
women with @entity43 have both the cysts and the symptoms caused by excess testosterone			0
' if i can go out on the street with a beard or moustache for a month , then surely men who are experiencing health problems can go and get themselves tested			0
' i think it is awful that some men are too embarassed to have a simple test which could save them from prostate or testicular cancer			0
' my facial hair used to contribute to depression and anxiety but this is for a good cause and i want to highlight that people should n't judge you on what you have on your face , it 's what is inside that matters			2
' the 36 - year - old has already raised £ 200 on her @entity7 fundraising page , on which she has included a message describing how she hopes ' to use my @entity43 as a tool for raising awareness for men 's cancers - if i get just one man to get checked out it will be worth it '			1
mrs @entity15 's page has been inundated with posts from donors impressed by her decision to reveal the embarassing side - effect of her condition for a good cause			0
one comment said : ' i think you are fab for doing this ! ! very inspiring ! ! ' another read : ' as a fellow @entity43 sufferer i know i 'm nowhere near as brave as you but you rock - great kudos to your courage			0
