by @entity0 published : 08:49 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 12:57 est , 6 april 2013 a mother of three lay dead beneath six feet of rubbish for 19 months before anyone noticed she was there , an inquest has heard			2
the skeletal remains of @entity7 , 37 , were found curled in a foetal position beneath a pile of bin bags to the rear of a derelict house , yards from where she lived in @entity15			1
her body was so badly decomposed no cause of death could be determined and authorities had to resort to calling in an archaeologist to help with post-mortem examinations			1
' a desperately sad and shocking case ' : coroner @entity24 , sitting at @entity23 , could not determine the cause of @entity7 's death because her remains were so badly decayed ' this is a desperately sad and tragic case , ' said @entity15 coroner @entity24			1
' it is also in some ways shocking that the body of a young woman of some 37 years of age can lie undiscovered for a period of 19 months			2
' ms @entity7 was last seen alive in august 2009 and her final bank activity was a month later , police said			1
the heavy - drinking mother may have died from sniffing solvents after an aerosol can was found beside her , a pathologist said , but he was unable to make a definitive finding because the body was so badly decayed			1
the coroner could not determine a cause of death			2
' it appears quite clear that @entity7 's life was out of control and sadly it appears @entity7 was in the grips of some sort of alcoholism or addiction , ' mr @entity24 said			1
her brother @entity54 had not seen her since 2006 and a close friend said she had become afraid to leave her home			2
@entity56 recalled her drinking from morning to night , litre after litre of cider			2
' she was sitting crying like a baby , ' ms @entity56 added			0
ms @entity7 was only found after an elderly neighbour complained about the growing piles of rubbish at the property on @entity65 , which the inquest heard was a common spot for fly - tipping			1
construction workers found the dead woman in april 2011 , the @entity69 reported her body was covered in several old fractures from an accident or assault , pathologist dr @entity76 said , including a bone in her neck broken by pressure			1
none of these injuries caused her death and had happened a considerable time beforehand , the expert added			2
an archaeology expert had to be brought in to identify the different fractures , which may have been caused by falls linked to excessive drinking			1
miss @entity7 had a difficult start to life and was put into foster care after her parents split , her brother said			1
she later went through a divorce , descending into a spiral of depression and alcoholism , the inquest heard			0
' she thought the whole world was against her , ' mr @entity54 recalled			0
after her divorce she ' dropped off the radar ' , the coroner said			0
she stayed with friends or in hostels but later moved into a property at @entity106 , close to where her body was found , with a friend called @entity108			1
he told police she tended to leave for weeks at a time and he did not consider them to be in a relationship			0
after she disappeared in august 2009 he assumed she was living somewhere else			0
he was interviewed by police but a detective told the inquest his account was plausible and there were no signs of a crime having been committed			0
dr @entity76 said : ' within the limits imposed by the degree of decomposition there was nothing that i found to suggest that she had been the victim of a homicide			0
' her bones were found curled in a foetal position with an aerosol and plastic bag close			1
a pathologist said she may have been inhaling the gases of the spray , which can interfere with the heart beat , but it was not possible to analyse for the toxic substances			0
the coroner said it was clear she was not the victim of a murder			0
' her death will remain undetermined due to advanced decomposition , ' he added			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity7 's body was so decomposed no cause of death could be determined
the heavy - drinking mother was found with an aerosol can and plastic bag close by
