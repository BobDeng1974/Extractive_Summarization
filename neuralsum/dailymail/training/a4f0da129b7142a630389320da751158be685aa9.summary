by @entity0 the @entity1 head to the @entity2 to take on the @entity3 , with both teams looking to turn their early season form around			1
last season , this @entity7 divisional match - up was split 1 - 1 with the home team emerging victorious on both occasions			1
the @entity3 made an impressive start to the 2014 season with a 37 - 34 victory over divisional rival rivals the @entity15			1
quarterback @entity16 set a franchise record in that game , throwing for 448 yards and three touchdowns			2
any euphoria that may have spilt over into sunday ’s game against @entity22 quickly diminished as @entity24 ’s deficiencies along the offensive line were exposed during a crushing 24 - 10 defeat by the @entity27			1
@entity3 quarterback @entity16 threw a record 448 yards and three touchdowns against @entity15 but completed just 24 of 44 passes against @entity22 wide receiver @entity30 is in doubt for the @entity3 after missing monday 's training with a hamstring injury @entity16 looked a shadow of himself , completing just 24 of 44 passes for 231 yards , and one touchdown			1
@entity16 was under duress throughout the contest , throwing three interceptions and taking two sacks			0
wideout @entity30 missed training on monday due to a hamstring injury and remains questionable			0
he would be a huge loss for the @entity3 as @entity30 averages 11.4 yards per reception			0
with @entity30 listed as questionable , look for @entity45 and @entity46 to have an increased role			0
@entity1 ’s new defensive scheme under @entity49 will have their hands full trying to contain @entity45 – who amassed 283 yards and two touchdowns last year			1
despite the play of rookie quarterback @entity53 during @entity1 's miserable 2013 campaign , head coach @entity49 has opted to go with experience under centre			1
@entity57 joined the @entity1 on a two - year deal following an impressive stint in @entity60 during @entity62 ’s absence - recording 13 touchdowns and just one interception			1
however , @entity57 ’s play from last season has yet to carry over into this season for the @entity1			1
another player who seems to revel in this this fixture is @entity1 running back @entity70			2
the last time the two met , @entity71 rushed for 163 yards and scored three touchdowns			0
@entity57 's form from his run with @entity60 last campaign is yet to emerge for @entity1 running back @entity70 scored three tds and rushed for 163 yards last time out against the @entity3 with @entity78 out ( knee ) the @entity3 will have their work cut out as the defense has surrendered an average of four yards per carry			2
should the offensive line hold up for @entity57 , look for him to expose the @entity3 secondary who give up a current league high of nine yards per reception			0
wideout @entity88 has been @entity57 ’s go - to guy during the team ’s first two games , @entity88 has been targeted 16 times , reeling in eight of those for 87 yards			2
rookie @entity93 is growing in confidence with every snap and made an impressive 29 - yard catch during the 19 - 17 loss to the @entity98			0
@entity93 was shaken up late in the game , but is expected to play on thursday			0
to have your say on the @entity102 , listen to the @entity104 's live call in show on sundays from 4pm			0
