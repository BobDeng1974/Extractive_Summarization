by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 06:25 est , 4 march 2013 she is one of the world 's most beautiful and recognisable women , so painting an accurate portrait of the @entity5 will never be easy			1
but one woman has been praised for her ' warm ' portrait of @entity5 - weeks after the official one was slammed by critics			2
artist @entity10 , 47 , was inspired to paint her own picture of the former @entity5 after the official portrait by @entity13 was branded ' rotten ' and ' unflattering '			1
praised : @entity10 has been praised for her ' warm ' portrait of the @entity5 - after the official one was slammed by critics she spent three weeks perfecting her portrait of the princess , showing her looking relaxed and beaming warmly			1
and now @entity10 has grand plans to show her hard work to the @entity5			2
' the official portrait is technically brilliant but i do n't think it captures the true natural beauty and personality of the @entity5 , ' said @entity24 , who lives in @entity25 , near @entity26 , @entity27			1
inspiration : @entity10 was inspired to paint her own picture of @entity5 after the official portrait by @entity13 was branded ' rotten ' and ' unflattering ' and she is very proud of the result ' she has a great deal of warmth , which is why she is so popular and i wanted to show that in a portrait of my own			1
' i 'm pleased with the result and i 've had a lot of good feedback , saying that my picture makes her look much more human			0
' perfection : she spent three weeks perfecting her portrait of the princess and critics have claimed it shows @entity5 looking relaxed and ' warm ' @entity24 , whose past pictures have been snapped up by the chief executive of advertising agency @entity49 , used a series of photos of @entity5 as inspiration for her portrait			1
in the final portrait she is shown dressed in a red suit which she wore on the @entity57 trip to @entity58 in @entity59			0
lady in red : @entity5 is shown dressed in a red suit which she wore on the royal trip to @entity58 in @entity59 @entity24 now hopes to sell the portrait for £ 2,000 , with the proceeds going to a charity of the @entity68 's choosing			1
she said : ' i am going to contact @entity70 as i would like the @entity68 to see the portrait and choose a charity for the money to be donated to			2
' in the past @entity24 has also painted princess @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
warmth : @entity10 believes that @entity5 has a great deal of warmth , which is what she wanted to show that in her portrait when the first official portrait of the @entity5 was unveiled at the @entity89 in january it was greeted with a global eyebrow - raise you could practically hear			1
though @entity5 herself , 31 , said @entity13 's likeness of her was ' amazing ' and ' brilliant ' , and her husband @entity95 told the artist it was ' absolutely beautiful ' , critics dismissed it as unflattering , ageing and even ' rotten '			1
@entity13 even bit back at his critics , saying the aftermath of its unveiling felt like a ' witch hunt ' , but that there is still ' nothing i would have changed ' about his painting			0
critical : @entity13 's official portrait was met by much criticism , although both the @entity68 and @entity5 were impressed speaking to @entity111 , he said : ' some of the words written about it were so personal			1
i 'd be inhuman if i said it did n't affect me			0
when you take on commissions like this it is hazardous and you expect a bit of flak , but i expected nothing like the criticism i have received			0
i did n't expect it to go to the levels it did			0
' it felt like a bit of a witch hunt and people who have not even seen my portrait joined in with what quickly became a circus			0
the worst thing is it was not only destructive to me , but particularly upsetting for my two daughters and my wife			0
' @entity13 said that the praise of the @entity68 and @entity5 meant more to him ' than anything else said or written ' , but that he would urge people to visit the @entity89 since he feels ' half the problem is that the portrait does n't photograph well '			2
according to the gallery , the number of people visiting since the painting went on display on 11 january has risen from 24,000 over that weekend , up from 17,000 the week before			0
the @entity148 reported that postcards of the portrait are the fastest - selling item in the history of the gallery 's permanent collection			0
