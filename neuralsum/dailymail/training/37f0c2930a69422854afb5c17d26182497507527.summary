by @entity1 reporter published : 17:44 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 18:00 est , 26 november 2013 a @entity3 judge has ruled that the 911 recordings from @entity5 will be released publicly even though the parents of the slain students pushed for them to be sealed			1
the recordings , which capture the horrific moments when last december â€™s attack unfolded , are scheduled to be released on december 4 - just ten days before the first anniversary			1
the state 's @entity12 ruled in september that the recordings should be provided to @entity14 , but state 's attorney @entity15 asked for a stay while he appeals that order			2
heartbreaking : the judge ruled that the 911 calls should be released because they will be used to vindicate the actions of the emergency responders who arrived at @entity5 on december 14 , 2012 the prosecutor still does have the chance to appeal the release , which was announced on tuesday afternoon			1
' the court recognizes and is deeply sensitive to the fact that the families and friends of those who died in this tragedy , as well as others in the greater @entity5 community , may desire that the 911 audio recordings never be released , ' @entity26 superior court judge @entity25 wrote			2
' the public airing by the media of some or all of the recordings that will undoubtedly follow their release will likely be a searing reminder of the horror and pain of that awful day			2
' but the judge said the recordings are public , and he rejected arguments for keeping them sealed			2
shattered window : almost a year since the shooting , @entity47 has released crime scene pictures including the one above , which shows the shattered front entrance of @entity5 the harrowing image above shows damage done inside the front entrance at @entity5 following the december 14 , 2012 shooting rampage he said that the release will help the public gauge the appropriateness of law enforcement 's response			1
the mind of a killer : a new report revealed how @entity65 kept spreadsheets comparing mass killings and only communicated with his mother via email ' in fact , public analysis of the recordings may serve to vindicate and support the professionalism and bravery of the first responders ... who themselves have undoubtedly been subject to emotional turmoil and pain in witnessing the scene at @entity5 , ' @entity25 wrote			1
' delaying the release of the audio recordings , particularly where the legal justification to keep them confidential is lacking , only serves to fuel speculation about and undermine confidence in our law enforcement officials			0
' the @entity14 has sought the recordings in part to examine the police response to the massacre , which left 20 first - graders and six educators dead			0
if the recordings are released , the @entity14 would review the content and determine what , if any , of it would meet the news cooperative 's standards for publication			1
the announcement about the release of the tapes comes one day after a new collection of crime scene photos were made public , showing how shooter @entity65 taped over his bedroom windows with garbage bags			1
@entity65 's bedroom , pictured , was bare with black plastic garbage bags taped to the windows in this handout crime scene evidence photo provided by the @entity47 , shows firearms and ammunition found on or in close proximity to shooters body at @entity5 following the december 14 , 2012 shooting rampage the explosive 44 - page report offers a detailed look at the massacre that rocked the nation but no motive could be established			1
@entity65 , 20 , was obsessed with @entity122 and other mass murders and drove by the @entity5 , @entity3 school the day before his heartbreaking rampage			1
he also plotted his own death by watching videos of suicides and had taken pictures of himself holding a rifle and separately a handgun to his head			0
questions are being raised about the relationship between the boy and his mother , because even though friends say she would have done anything for her son , they exhibited some unusual behavior which was unearthed in the investigation			0
they would communicate via email even though they lived in the same house , and she would never check his room - which he would not allow - even though she knew he was not taking his psychological medication and had an affinity for guns			0
@entity65 's fascination with violence was apparent to teachers and other acquaintances			1
he collected materials on mass killings and kept a spreadsheet ranking of mass murders			0
@entity65 , 20 , shot his mother in the head four times dec. 14 , then drove to @entity5 , where he killed 20 first - graders and six women with a semi-automatic rifle			2
he committed suicide as police arrived			0
@entity167 , who was divorced from @entity65 's father , indicated that she did not work because of her son 's condition			1
in their spacious @entity5 home , she catered to his requests , cooking to his specifications and getting rid of a cat because he did not want it in the house			2
she often took her soon shooting at a gun range			0
she legally purchased all of the weapons that her son carried the day of the massacre , and she had written a check to buy him a pistol for @entity189			0
a friend of @entity167 's , @entity191 , said that she was a devoted mother to her two sons and that she showed up at @entity65 's elementary school to protect him when he was picked on by other children			1
@entity195 , a criminologist at @entity196 in @entity197 , said @entity167 did not ignore her son 's psychological problems and can not be blamed for his actions			0
' she was a victim , not an accessory , ' he said			0
' we can easily second - guess parents , and there 's a lot there we can question , but the fact of the matter is many people commit horrible crimes despite the best efforts of parents , siblings and others			0

tapes were *originally* planned to be sealed but that ruling was *overturned*
are now scheduled to be released on december 4 but that gives enough time for the **decision** to be appealed
**decision** comes one day after a new report released pages of *information* about shooter @entity65 's home life and crime scene photos
