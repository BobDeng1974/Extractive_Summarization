@entity0 , senior @entity1 executive and a former head of sport , has emerged as a contender to become the new general secretary of the @entity6			1
@entity0 , who organised the @entity1 move to @entity8 , worked very closely at the corporation alongside @entity6 chairman @entity10 when the latter was director general			1
and @entity0 , who is married to the actress @entity13 , was able to win back a number of important football rights for the @entity1 , including the @entity16 , @entity18 internationals and @entity19 highlights because of a large increase in the sports budget agreed by @entity10			1
@entity1 executive @entity0 ( right , with wife @entity13 ) could become the @entity6 's new general secretary and reunite with @entity1 's former director general and @entity6 chairman @entity10 ( left ) also @entity0 ’s potential candidature could explain why @entity10 remains in favour of not employing headhunters for the search , preferring the @entity6 board to save money by choosing from their pool of contacts			1
another early name in the frame to replace the departing @entity35 is @entity36 , who has impressed @entity10 and others at @entity38 with the way he has re-organised the @entity6 as chief executive since leaving @entity42 cricket			2
the @entity6 remain remarkably confident that a sponsor for the @entity16 will finally be found before the third round — and one prepared to match the £ 9m a year paid by previous backers @entity46			1
it is understood that another beer company are still in talks but the clock is ticking with the third - round draw on december 8			0
@entity52 's agent @entity51 is one of the concerned middle men who has had discussions with the @entity6 about @entity55 - who heads the 1966 agency who represent the @entity18 players - also looking after @entity59 through @entity55 ’s new sports management agency , @entity60			2
@entity55 received the go - ahead from the @entity6 to sign @entity18 regular @entity59 but the conflict of interests has upset some @entity6 sponsors and other agents looking after @entity18 footballers			0
@entity59 's agent @entity55 also represents @entity18 players , sparking worries of a conflict of interest @entity18 women ’s match against @entity73 at @entity38 on sunday will draw a capped crowd of 55,000			1
remarkable as that record attendance is , the match could have attracted as many as 75,000 , such was the ongoing demand for tickets had underground engineering works not led to the restrictions			0
and more viewers will tune in to the @entity1 ’s live coverage of the women ’s international than will watch either of the two @entity84 matches on @entity85			0
@entity18 's women will face @entity73 in front of a crowd of 55,000 at @entity38 but it could have been 75,000 time to ban the band ? @entity91 manager @entity90 has complained to the @entity6 about the @entity18 supporters ’ band encouraging offensive chanting during the @entity6 match			1
@entity90 , who was in the @entity18 section at @entity97 , intends to make an official complaint to @entity99 if the @entity6 do n’t take action against the band , whose drumbeat to the repetitive singing of ‘ @entity104 ’ happened regularly during the first half until an @entity6 official told them to stop			2
@entity90 claims the band ’s actions were a lot worse than him and three colleagues wearing t - shirts during @entity113 calling for the release from prison of former @entity117 leader @entity116 - for which they received official warnings from the @entity6			0
@entity91 manager @entity90 will make a complaint to police over the supporter 's band backing @entity126 singing at @entity38 if the @entity6 do n't take action meanwhile , @entity128 will be relieved their eight - year sponsorship of the band finished before the @entity131 , sparing them any further association with a discredited outfit			1
it is considered unlikely the band will find fresh backers to fund their @entity18 trips , although band leader @entity138 and the @entity6 have apologised			2
@entity140 commentator @entity139 had to re-record his commentary of @entity18 ’s first goal against @entity6 after wrongly identifying the scorer as @entity52 rather than @entity144			0
however , from where @entity139 was sitting in the woefully antiquated @entity97 press box , the scorer ’s body shape did look remarkably like @entity52 , who was also credited with the goal initially by the @entity18 @entity151 feed and @entity152 on @entity153			0
but @entity155 ’s @entity154 called the goal for the @entity158 first time .			0

@entity1 executive @entity0 a contender for @entity6 general secretary role
@entity0 could join @entity6 chairman @entity10 , who was @entity1 director general
the @entity6 is confident of naming an @entity16 sponsor to replace @entity46
@entity18 women face @entity73 in front of 55,000 ( could have been *77,000* )
@entity18 supporter 's band 's days could be numbered after @entity173 chants
