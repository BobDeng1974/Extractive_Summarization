a fortnight ago , eight - year - old @entity0 gingerly stepped off a plane at @entity2 , his lips blue			1
it was n’t the @entity6 weather that had turned them such a deathly colour : @entity8 – @entity0 ’s home country – can be just as cold in early spring			0
rather , it was a combination of rare heart problems that meant blood was not getting around his body properly			1
in fact , it was receiving little over half the oxygen it should			0
ever since birth , congenital heart defects meant @entity0 was being slowly starved of air , much like a climber marooned at high altitude			1
since @entity0 was four , he and his family have had to live with the devastating conflict that has ripped @entity8 apart , claiming more than 200,000 lives in the process			1
dodging bombs and bullets , his family first fled their @entity42 home just weeks before it was blown to bits by president @entity45 ’s jets			1
then they took refuge in a village near the @entity50 border , only for it to become the focus of fierce fighting			0
like thousands of other children , @entity0 has spent time in a tented refugee camp too			0
unsurprisingly , his health suffered – and his family frequently feared he would die			1
but today , thanks to a @entity6 charity which brought him here for a life - saving operation , @entity0 looks like a different boy			1
in fact , just days after undergoing surgery at the @entity61 in @entity29 , he appears remarkably healthy			0
like any impatient eight - year - old , he grabs a mobile phone from his father @entity27 – with whom he shares an unmistakable likeness – to show him how it really works			1
his eyes are bright – and his lips are pink			0
‘ @entity0 is a walking miracle , ’ says @entity70 , chief executive of @entity71 , which brings children to @entity6 for heart surgery and conducts operating missions abroad			1
devastation : a man walks with children in @entity80 's home town of @entity42 after it was hit by bombs last year ‘ most children in the @entity6 with his condition , called @entity85 , would be treated on the @entity86 soon after birth			1
but he has been walking around with this for eight years , been bombed , and had to flee			1
’ curling up on his father ’s lap , shy @entity0 simply says he is ‘ happy ’ to be recovering after his operation			1
it involved patching up a huge hole in his heart , widening a crucial vessel taking blood out of the heart , and correcting a narrow valve			1
the operation , performed without charge by consultant cardiothoracic surgeon @entity102 , means his heart now pumps more efficiently			1
and thanks to the hole being closed , de-oxygenated ‘ blue ’ blood will no longer be mixed with fresh blood			0
without it , mr @entity102 says , @entity0 ’s life would have been ‘ severely limited ’			2
he would have got progressively weaker and would probably have died in early adulthood			0
instead , he should now have ‘ a fairly normal future ’ and could even be up and playing football within weeks			0
‘ children , in general , recover amazingly quickly after heart surgery , ’ says mr @entity102			2
mr @entity0 , a physics teacher , holds his son tight			0
‘ it was a race against time to get him here , ’ he says			0
aged three , @entity0 was flown to @entity116 to be fitted with a stent to widen a heart opening , but the family knew that was a temporary fix			1
as daily life became more difficult , @entity0 ’s health went slowly downhill			1
by summer 2012 , things had got so bad that mr @entity0 decided to move the family out of @entity42			2
‘ we fled with nothing except our clothes , ’ says mr @entity0			0
the family , who are @entity129 , took shelter in a village where they have roots			2
‘ leaving @entity42 was awful , but a month after we left , the apartment block where we lived was bombed			0
we lost everything and heard friends of ours had been killed			0
’ but they could not escape the war			0
by early 2013 fighting had spread to their village near @entity142 , close to the @entity50 border , so they moved again – this time to a tented camp			0
a month later , with @entity0 ’s fragile health getting worse , the family returned to the village , only for mr @entity0 to face interrogation by @entity151 fighters from a group called the @entity153			2
despite being a @entity129 himself , they held him captive , asked him why he had left , and whose side he was really on			0
homeless : the apartment block @entity80 and his family were forced to flee before it was blown to bits by president @entity45 ’s jets ‘ i was in prison for 25 days , ’ he recalls			1
‘ i thought that they were going to kill me			0
’ all this time he could do nothing to help @entity0 , who he desperately needed to take to @entity50 to see a heart specialist			2
after being set free , he took the boy and made for the border , helped by guides			2
father and son then spent months in @entity50 , during which they visited a cardiologist who confirmed the extent of @entity0 ’s problems			0
but nobody could help and they were forced to return to @entity8			0
finally , last november mr @entity0 ’s brother @entity181 , who lives in @entity29 , discovered @entity71			0
since being set up 20 years ago by pioneering heart surgeon professor sir @entity183 , the charity has treated more than 2,000 children			1
@entity0 and his family were in @entity8 when news filtered through that the operation would take place – prompting mr @entity0 and his wife @entity190 , 31 , to break down in tears			1
from there @entity0 and his father travelled to @entity194 and caught a flight to @entity29 , accompanied by a @entity197 doctor as there were concerns over how @entity0 would cope on the flight			1
the operation last sunday went well and @entity0 should soon be discharged			2
mr @entity0 is now considering applying for asylum in the @entity6			0
at the moment , @entity0 and his father are here on three - month medical visas			2
the charity stresses it does not get involved in immigration issues			2
while @entity0 ’s heart has been fixed , what his life now holds – like countless other @entity8 children – remains uncertain			1
