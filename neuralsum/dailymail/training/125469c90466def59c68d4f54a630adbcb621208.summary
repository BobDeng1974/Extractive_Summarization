investigators initially linked organised crime to the blast , close to the @entity72 school in @entity20			0
the town is home to the local mafia known as the @entity76 who have close links with the @entity80 and @entity81 crime and are linked to drug and gun running			2
the school is named after @entity85 , who was the wife of anti mafia judge @entity86 , who were both killed in a bomb blast in 1992 which was carried out by the @entity88			2
but today a senior official said the attack was probably carried out by a lone individual and played down earlier suspicions of mafia involvement			1

@entity113 said : ' the most probable hypothesis is that it was an isolated act			0
it seems improbable , not entirely to be excluded , that it is connected with mafia networks			0
he also said that attacks on other schools appeared unlikely and that police already had a facial composite picture of a suspect connected to the blast			0
suspicions of mafia involvement were fed not only by the fact that the school was named after the wife of a murdered anti-mafia judge , but also by the timing			1
the attack took place days before the 20th anniversary of the couple 's death in a bomb attack in @entity138			0
thousands took to the streets in demonstrations of sympathy and outrage at the mafia on saturday - but @entity113 said it was still unclear what had prompted the attack			1

it could be someone who wants to create tension for some ideological reason , ' @entity113 said			0

tv footage showed scenes of desperation as shoes and rucksacks were scattered over the floor , abandoned by the students as the bombs went off just as students arrived for lessons			1
although security across @entity19 has been stepped up with fears of anarchist attacks due to the drastic economic situation the theory quickly gathering momentum was a never before heard of attack on innocent schoolchildren by the mafia			1

it was an infernal scene			0
who could have done something like this ? they were just kids			0
