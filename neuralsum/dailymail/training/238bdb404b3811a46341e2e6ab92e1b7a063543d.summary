@entity1 manager @entity0 has urged supporters to ' make sure that we do n’t let anyone break our relationship ' with the club just two points above relegation and out of both cup competitions			1
during sunday 's 2 - 0 @entity13 defeat to @entity15 @entity14 , chants of ' @entity0 , it 's always our fault ' were directed at the manager , who promptly accused the media of misleading fans by misquoting him			1
but now @entity0 has attempted to clear the air with angry supporters by writing an impassioned open letter published on @entity1 's website			1
you can read the message in full below : @entity0 hit out at the media for misleading fans at @entity14 - and has now written to the supporters @entity1 supporters chanted ' @entity0 , it 's always our fault ' when the team went down 2 - 0 to @entity14 for the first time in my life i think is time for me to write this letter to you , the fans			1
when i had the opportunity to become the head coach of @entity1 , i just closed my eyes and remember me sitting at the away dressing room at the @entity41 at half time , 4 - 0 down , @entity1 4 @entity42 0 , incredible atmosphere , one of the best i ever felt , so the decision was easy , yes i would love the possibility of coaching @entity1 with those fans			1
luckily i got the job			0
i was brought into the club to stay in the @entity49 first and most , then get stability and then progress with an identity in our game			0
the first goal was the most difficult task of my life but we not only stayed up in a miraculous way , we went to @entity57 for the first time in years , plus successful games against our biggest rivals and enjoyed some incredible victories away from home			0
what we achieved last year was achieved by all of us together : club ( chairman , directors , staff and players ) and fans , nobody and i mean nobody from outside helped us a bit , it was only us together			2
then my second aim was to achieve stability , progression and then slowly start bringing a special way of playing football to make you very proud of our team			0
this takes time , but even if the aim is clear during the process , we need to keep competing and winning games somehow			0
during my career as a player , coach or manager , i have always had a fantastic relationship with the fans , from my time in @entity92 going through every team in @entity94 , always the relationship was strong , one of mutual respect and understanding , i showed from inside or from outside the pitch , my commitment , passion and dedication in achieving what every club deserved			2
of course i went through good and bad times , successful and not so good ones , winning or losing finals , but i left every single club having a recognition from the fans for my honesty , passion and professional work			2
so let 's make sure that we do n’t let anyone to break our relationship , i promise you that i care and want to win as much as you do and no one thinks more time every day about the team than i do , so i invite all of you to stay positive , to be strong , closer to each other and keep believing in what we started together last year , working harder to make it better this season			2
to finish i would like to clarify once more : the main responsible of the results of our team is me , i always said it and i will always accept my responsibility			0
i am really looking forward to see the @entity41 packed on saturday , pushing the team to what could be a very important victory			0
thank you and regards to all @entity0 @entity133 and @entity134 prepare to kick off with @entity135 after @entity14 's second goal @entity14 's @entity137 , a former @entity1 striker , is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring the second			1
