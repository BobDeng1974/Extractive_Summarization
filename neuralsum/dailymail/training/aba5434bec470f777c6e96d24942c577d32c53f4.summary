by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity2 cricket writer @entity0 's view of day three of the third test between @entity4 and @entity5 at the @entity6 , which saw @entity7 and @entity8 step up to the plate			1
@entity10 's caught out early @entity4 were celebrating a rare moment when they nipped an innings from no 9 @entity13 in the bud			2
caught via his pad by a lunging @entity16 for 19 , @entity13 had been dismissed for fewer than 50 for only the second time in five innings this series			0
thumbs up : @entity19 leaves the field after injuring his thumb attempting a catch during day three ... but it 's thumbs up for bell @entity19 , back in form since monday ’s elegant 167 , caused a scare when he went for an x-ray after being hit on the left thumb while fielding in the slips in the morning			0
but there was no break and with @entity4 insisting his injury was limited to ‘ acute bruising ’ , @entity19 remained off the field for treatment			0
@entity38 and @entity37 to expectations the two @entity41 batsmen @entity4 feared most before the series started were @entity38 and @entity43			2
but their respective contributions yesterday of 24 and 39 meant the pair have managed just one half - century between them in this series from 10 innings			0
do n't believe the hype ! @entity38 and @entity43 have not lived up to their reputations @entity53 puts together a royal innings @entity56 all - rounder @entity55 was dropped for this test because his batting had disintegrated , so the selectors will have noted with relief the 56 - ball 50 he made against @entity62 in the 50 - over @entity61			1
that ’s an improvement on the 18 runs he had managed in his previous 10 innings for @entity4 in all formats , including six ducks			0
@entity69 and @entity70 record double act when @entity7 had @entity43 caught in the slips not long after lunch , it was the 22nd time @entity75 had clung on from his bowling			1
that equalled the @entity4 record for a bowler / non-wicketkeeper combination , now shared with sir @entity81 and @entity82			1
double act : @entity7 ( @entity84 ) and @entity75 have equalled @entity4 's record for bowler / non-wicketkeeper combination 500 partnership for anderson and broad another partnership milestone was brought up by @entity7 ’s removal of @entity92 — the 500th test wicket claimed by him and @entity8 in @entity94 they have played together			1
only two pairings stand in front of them : @entity5 ’s @entity99 and @entity100 took 762 between them and @entity103 ’s @entity102 and @entity104 559 .			0

@entity13 was *dimissed* for less than 50 for only second time in his career
@entity19 was given all - clear after fears he had broken his thumb against @entity5
