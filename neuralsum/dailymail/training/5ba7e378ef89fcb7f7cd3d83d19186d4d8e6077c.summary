by @entity0 published : 17:37 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 17:37 est , 5 june 2013 shopping is more pleasurable than sex for more than half of @entity6 women , a new survey has revealed			1
fifty - five per cent said that a good day out at the shops is a bigger thrill than spending time between the sheets , even though 10 per cent of items purchased will never make it out of the wardrobe			1
a retail - addicted 11 per cent told researchers that shopping is always better than love - making , regardless of the circumstances			0
thrill : for more than half of @entity6 women , a day shopping is better than a night of passion with their husband the study of 2000 @entity6 women , all of whom were in relationships , also found that the average woman thinks about shopping six times a week compared with four times a week spent indulging in ' sexy ' thoughts			1
worryingly , the study also found that shopping can be a source of tension for couples , with 37 per cent saying that joint shopping trips are often the cause of a heated row			1
as a result , the majority of women prefer to shop with friends or alone , with just 16 per cent saying that they wanted to spend more time shopping with their partners			1
even children were seen as a better choice of shopping partner - 23 per cent of the mothers polled said their husbands were more trouble than their offspring			2

' the odd impulse buy that never gets worn is a small price to pay given how much satisfaction a spot of retail therapy can give ! ' we hope our new series @entity65 will remind people just how much fun shopping can be and how incredible @entity6 high - street fashion is			2
' but the survey also found that the @entity6 passion for fashion also resulted in a significant amount of wasted cash , with nine per cent admitting that 30 per cent of the things they buy are never used or worn			2
wasteful habits were particularly notable among those who splashed the cash on accessories , with over a third of women admitting to owning at least three pairs of shoes that they have never worn while nearly a fifth have at least three unused handbags gathering dust			0
in total , the average woman has unworn clothing and accessories worth £ 697.23 piled up in their closets			0
the stack of unworn and unwanted clothing also has a negative impact on stress levels , with more than a quarter of women polled admitting that they suffer from regular bouts of guilt thanks to the amount of shopping they do			2
