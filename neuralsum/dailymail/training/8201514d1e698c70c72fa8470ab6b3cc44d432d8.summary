by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:29 est , 26 february 2014 @entity3 : 04:40 est , 26 february 2014 tough new language checks for @entity6 doctors are to come into force from this summer			2
it comes as nine out of 10 patients and health workers backed the idea of striking off doctors who refuse to learn @entity14			0
the @entity15 will also be able to force doctors from the @entity17 to take language tests if there are concerns about their ability to communicate with their patients			1
doctors from the @entity17 will face new language tests to ensure patients are protected under existing rules , the @entity15 can only test the language skills of foreign doctors from outside the @entity17			1
since 1983 it has been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from member states			0
there are more than 27,000 doctors from the @entity36 working in the @entity37 , none of whom have ever been tested for their @entity14 skills			2
under a @entity15 consultation which has just closed , there will be a new category in fitness to practise cases in which a doctor can be found ‘ impaired because he or she does not have the necessary knowledge of @entity14 ’			1
there will also be a new power to force doctors to undergo an @entity14 language test if a ‘ relevant , serious complaint is made about them ’			2
the @entity15 will also have the power to ‘ indefinitely suspend doctors who do n’t develop sufficient @entity14 language skills to treat patients safely ’			1
@entity57 , chief executive of the @entity15 , said : ‘ doctors who want to practise in the @entity37 must be able to communicate effectively in @entity14 to ensure the safety of their patients			1
‘ these new measures to ensure doctors from other @entity6 countries can communicate in @entity14 , combined with the higher test score requirements , will help us strengthen protection for patients			1
they will also bring about a greater degree of fairness between our requirements for @entity6 doctors and for those from outside @entity6			2
’ lethal dose : @entity75 dr @entity74 killed a patient after confusing two different drugs in 2008 @entity75 dr @entity78 killed @entity80 patient @entity79 when he confused two drugs and gave him 10 times the recommended dose of diamorphine			0
health minister @entity84 said : ‘ overseas doctors make a valuable contribution to the national health service			0
‘ however , it is vital that all doctors practising in the @entity37 have the necessary language skills to help ensure patient safety and quality of care			2
’ he insisted that individual @entity96 organisations are responsible for ‘ ensuring that the people they employ have the required knowledge and skills , including language competency , for the posts for which they are applying ’			0
an alarming 66 cases were investigated by senior @entity96 staff in 2011 after patients complained that they had received poor treatment from doctors who had a poor grasp of the @entity14 language			0
in an attempt to tackle the problem , in september the government proposed introducing language tests specifically for doctors arriving from @entity17 countries in what would amount to a change to @entity17 law			0
in a public consultation on the issue , nine out of 10 respondents agreed that the @entity15 should have the power to require a doctor to undergo a language assessment when there is a serious concern about their knowledge of @entity14 , and that the @entity15 should not grant a licence to practise to @entity6 doctors who are unable or unwilling to show they have the necessary knowledge of @entity14			1
eight out of 10 respondents felt that that the @entity15 should indefinitely suspend doctors who fail to acquire the necessary knowledge of @entity14 to treat patients in the @entity37 safely			1
under the government 's plans , the @entity15 would not be given the right to automatically test all @entity17 doctors , but it would be able to carry out tests if concerns were raised when they registered to work			1
inspectors can check competency when looking at qualifications , how long doctors have been registered in other countries and what experience they have			0
red flags might include doctors turning up with interpreters , poor @entity14 in interviews or poor written @entity14 on application forms			0
any worries could then prompt full testing of the doctor 's language skills			0
the new plans would also allow the @entity15 to assess any doctor if language concerns arise during a fitness - to - practise investigation			1
at present , the @entity15 has no powers to carry out such checks during its hearings .			0

doctors from overseas wanting to practise in @entity37 will need to *achieve* score of *7.5* out of 9 in the @entity167 test
if they fail to meet these requirements , they could be struck off
new plans would also allow the @entity15 to assess any doctor if language concerns arise during a fitness - to - practise investigation
