by @entity0 children as young as ten are being arrested on suspicion of rape amid fears that online pornography is twisting their view of sex and relationships			1
the scale of sexual offences committed by primary school children was revealed in disturbing figures from police forces across the country			1
twenty - four forces arrested children under 13 for suspected rape in the past year while seven detained at least one ten year old			1
surfing the web : twenty - four forces arrested children under 13 for suspected rape in the past year ( file picture ) the figures , obtained by the @entity22 under a @entity24 request , highlight growing concerns at the influence of online pornography on impressionable young minds			1
yesterday @entity30 spokesman @entity29 said there was ‘ undoubtedly ’ a link between children carrying out sexual assaults and easy access to online pornography , which gives them a ‘ distorted picture of what sexual relationships should be about ’			1
@entity41 , from the @entity42 ’ @entity43 on internet safety , said : ‘ there is already a widespread feeling that the internet is playing an unhealthy part in the early sexualisation of children and these revelations about the arrests of ten - year - olds for rape will add fuel to the flames			1
’ the prime minister has promised to toughen controls on internet pornography by offering a series of optional filters whenever a customer buys a new computer or signs up to a new provider			0
but the @entity22 has called for much stricter controls which would see an automatic pornography block , with users having to ‘ opt in ’ to view adult material			2
the figures were uncovered in a survey of all 52 police forces across @entity73			1
proposals : prime minister @entity75 has promised to toughen controls on internet pornography by offering a series of optional filters whenever a customer buys a new computer or signs up to a new provider of the 39 that responded , 31 forces had arrested children between the ages of ten and 13 on suspicion of rape in the past year			1
a boy of 12 raped a nine - year - old neighbour because he wanted to ‘ feel grown up ’ after watching hardcore porn online			1
with unrestricted access to the internet , the schoolboy , now 14 , looked at explicit sites before taking the girl to a garden shed and copying what he had watched			2
the shocking case , on the @entity98 , came to light because the girl started to feel ill and told her mother that she was scared she had a ‘ baby in my tummy ’			0
the @entity102 in @entity103 heard earlier this year how the boy repeatedly attacked the girl between december 1 , 2010 , and january 31 , 2011			0
he also abused her in his bedroom while a 12 - year - old friend watched			0
the boy later confessed to police and showed them the hardcore sites he had seen online			2
asked why he copied them , he said it was because of ‘ temptation ’ and ‘ to feel grown up ’			0
he was placed in a secure unit after pleading guilty to one charge of rape and two of sexual assault			0
he will be closely supervised by social workers until the age of 18			0
@entity120 said the youngest child arrested for rape was aged just ten while six said the youngest was 11 , and 11 forces said the youngest suspect was 12			2
forces reported only the age of the youngest child they had arrested for the crime , meaning the actual number of very young children detained in each age group could be much higher			1
according to the figures , 357 children aged 18 and under were found guilty of a range of sex crimes including rape , sexual assaults on other children , grooming , incest and taking or possessing indecent photographs of minors			1
the @entity30 ’s mr @entity29 said pornography was a powerful influence on this generation of children			1
‘ some young people do not have an understanding of consent – if they want something they will go out to get it , whatever the consequences , ’ he said			0
‘ there is a definite link between this and watching hardcore porn			2
it is an issue of entitlement			0
if a child has watched a rape scene the same child might attempt to act that piece of behaviour out			0
the children talk about acting out what they have watched			0
’ one child abuse investigator said the easy availability of pornography was changing children ’s behaviour			2
the civilian investigator , who works for a @entity174 force , said : ‘ when we arrest juveniles for sex crimes we increasingly find they have accessed hardcore pornography			0
‘ this is often on their phones where they store videos and pictures to share with their friends			0
it is not something my colleagues would have dealt with ten years ago			0
’ in one case in @entity192 , a ten - year - old boy was involved in the suspected gang rape by three boys of a 12 - year - old girl in a public park			2
@entity198 and @entity199 police also arrested a ten - year - old ‘ alleged to have forced a friend to perform a sex act on several occasions ’			1
police in @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , and @entity208 also arrested ten - year - olds on suspicion of rape in 2011			1
the @entity22 ’s campaign for an ‘ opt in ’ system on internet pornography is supported by the deputy children ’s commissioner @entity214			2
earlier this year , mrs @entity214 told mps that online porn is turning children into sex attackers			1
‘ they have watched things and then they ’ve enacted them , ’ she said			0
‘ it has definitely affected children ’s thresholds of what they think is normal			0
