@entity75 , which has riled @entity5 leaders and frustrated @entity86 by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into @entity3 , said this week it would help @entity67 @entity5 fighters cross into @entity13 to help their brethren against the militants , who also are being attacked by a @entity8 - led campaign of airstrikes			1

' this is a big turning point in @entity5 history , ' said @entity182 , the speaker of parliament			2
' troops used to be sent to occupy @entity5 lands , but now we are sending soldiers to protect our @entity5 brothers abroad , ' he said			2

' it turns out that what was done was wrong , ' he said , according to @entity75 's private @entity227 news agency			0
the @entity75 government is reluctant to aid the @entity13 @entity5 forces - the @entity26 , or @entity26 - because it views them as an extension of the @entity231 , or @entity231 , which has waged a 30 - year insurgency in @entity75 and is designated a terrorist group by the @entity8 and @entity108			1
the @entity234 confirmed that @entity223 militants were able to seize one of the 28 bundles of weapons and medical supplies intended for @entity5 fighters			2
@entity75 's decision to give @entity55 passage to fight in @entity13 marked a shift in position , even though @entity245 in recent years has built friendly ties with the leadership of the largely autonomous @entity67 @entity5 region			1
@entity250 spokesman @entity249 in @entity251 said there is still a lot of uncertainty on the details of the deployment , including how many forces will be sent and when			0
' we 're sending the peshmerga , not to become @entity26 but to fight alongside the @entity26 , ' @entity249 said			0
' we will send the peshmerga to do their job for as long as they 're needed and to come back after that			0

after two terrorist attacks in @entity269 in a week left two @entity269 soldiers dead , @entity32 has stepped up its rhetoric calling for even more radicals to carry out mass murder and mayhem in the country			0
