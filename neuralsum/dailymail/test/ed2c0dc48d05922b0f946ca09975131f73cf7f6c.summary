when @entity2 student @entity1 , 21 , posted a photo of a blue and black dress that looked white and gold from some angles , it sparked an internet debate so furious even a-listers could n't resist getting involved			1
now another internet dress furore has begun , this time over the colour of @entity14 leader @entity13 's dress			1
the @entity14 stalwart , 44 , wore the opinion - splitting ensemble , which has variously been described as blue , grey and green , for her appearance on the @entity22 contenders ' debate last night			2
while most plumped for grey , with some noting that she and mr @entity42 appeared intent on co-ordinating their look , others insisted that the colour was green			0
' wait , @entity13 's dress in that debate was green ? ' wrote a viewer named @entity54			1
' looked grey on my telly			0
' another , using the name @entity59 , complained : ' her dress was teal			0
papers have changed the colour , giving a less flattering skin tone ( making her look harsh ) '			0
sports journalist @entity67 also chipped in , writing : ' let 's focus on the most important issue from the debate			0
@entity13 's dress was clearly grey , not blue			1
' grey : many viewers watching the debate thought miss @entity13 's dress was grey different colour : in a photo taken as she left the studio , miss @entity13 's dress appeared to be blue going for green : under the studio lights , miss @entity13 's get - up seemed to be green back to grey : in this photo of @entity84 with the @entity86 's @entity85 , it once again looks grey not everyone was interested in the change in colour , which is likely to have been the result of harsh studio lights producing a different hue to the one seen in natural daylight , however			1
one irate viewer tweeted that they were concerned that the frock frenzy might overshadow the @entity14 's manifesto launch today			0
another , named @entity99 , said the focus on the dress missed the point			0
' are you telling me all people are worried about is @entity13 's dress ? ' she wrote			1
' it was a political debate dammit ! ' the furore over @entity84 's dress is n't the first time the @entity14 leader has made headlines for her sartorial nous			2
not impressed : one viewer declared her concerns about the debate overshadowing the @entity14 manifesto be serious ! another said viewers debating the colour of the dress were missing the point of the evening the original : this was the frock that sparked the original # thedress debate slick : miss @entity13 has been lauded for her dress sense and is seen here at the @entity127 stylish : miss @entity13 claims to be uninterested in clothes but admits to a passion for @entity131 shoes although the @entity14 leader claims to be uninterested in splashing out on expensive clothes and bags in the past , she has admitted to a weakness for shoes , albeit @entity131 rather than @entity136			1
those were in evidence at the main leader 's debate two weeks ago , when she wore a pair of skyscraper courts by the label with a chic coral two - piece by @entity146 label , @entity147			0
other fashion hits include the glamorous green floral dress and fitted jacket combination she wore to kickstart the @entity14 's election campaign and the pillar - box red dress worn to address supporters on the eve of last september 's @entity2 referendum .			2

viewers took to @entity28 to argue over the colour of @entity13 's dress
miss @entity13 's dress appeared blue in some lights and green in others
others thought she was *wearing* a grey dress during last night 's debate
the first # thedress debate was sparked by @entity2 student @entity1
