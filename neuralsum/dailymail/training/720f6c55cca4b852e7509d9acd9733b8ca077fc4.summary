@entity0 is about to start tapping into a huge source of diamonds that could supply the world market for the next 3,000 years			1
scientists estimate there are ' trillions of carats ' lying beneath a 35million - year - old asteroid crater in @entity10 - more than ten times the global stockpile			1
the @entity11 has known about the reserves under the 62 - mile - wide impact zone since the 1970s			1
but it has kept it a secret until now because it was already reaping big profits in what back then was a heavily controlled market			1
in the money : an aerial view of the 35 - mile - wide @entity23 crater in eastern @entity10 which contains ' trillions of carats of diamonds ' the @entity26 had also been producing various artificial diamonds for industry which proved a lucrative enterprise			1
government officials finally gave scientists from the nearby @entity32 and mineralogy permission to lift the lid on the crater 's hidden gems in a meeting with journalists over the weekend			0
the official news agency , @entity39 , said the diamonds at the site , known as @entity23 , are ' twice as hard ' as the usual gemstones , making them ideal for industrial and scientific uses			1
according to the @entity46 , the institute 's director , @entity44 , told the agency that the new source would cause a radical shake - up in the precious stones market			2
lucrative industry : these diamonds , weighing over 50 carats each , were found in @entity0 's @entity54 mine , which has been rich resource for the country , but nothing compared to the new one @entity0 's lucrative diamond industry was fuelled in large part by the colossal mine at @entity62 , above , in @entity54 , which produced immense profits for the country			2
operations started in the 1950s when scientists discovered a huge diamond deposit at the site , some 4,300km from @entity70			2
in the following half century , the mine yielded diamonds worth at least $ 17bn ( Â£ 10bn )			0
the pit shut down 11 years ago due to dwindling yields and safety issues			0
the @entity0 state diamond company @entity76 later began mining underground , but this is far more expensive and came during the financial meltdown			0
the new source at @entity23 makes @entity62 look like a mere rabbit hole and will bring a much - needed revival to the industry			1
' the resources of super-hard diamonds contained in rocks of the @entity87 crypto - explosion structure are by a factor of ten bigger than the world 's all known reserves , ' he said			1
' we are speaking about trillions of carats			0
by comparison , present - day known reserves in @entity54 ( a @entity0 mine ) are estimated at one billion carats			2
' the stones at @entity87 are known as ' impact diamonds ' which result when an object like a meteor strikes an existing diamond deposit			2
they are also unique , which will make them even more sought - after in high - precision scientific and industrial markets			1
@entity44 said : ' the value of impact diamonds is added by their unusual abrasive features and large grain size			0
' this expands significantly the scope of their industrial use and makes them more valuable for industrial purposes			0
' diamond production was booming in @entity0 in 2007 when output reached $ 1.35billion , 98 per cent of which was exported to @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity125 - east @entity124 and the @entity126			0
but the bottom fell out in 2009 when polished diamond production fell to an unprecedented low of us $ 350 million during the economic crisis			0
with world markets starting to show signs of resilience , this may explain why @entity0 has chosen now to reveal its hidden treasure .			0

supply under 35million - year - old impact zone is ten times bigger than global reserves
@entity11 discovered the site in the 1970s but kept it a secret until now to exploit *tightly* controlled market
diamonds at @entity23 in @entity10 are ' twice as hard ' as *normal* , making them ideal for high - precision scientific *instruments* and industry
