by @entity0 published : 16:05 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 05:56 est , 11 august 2013 the @entity3 ’s @entity2 game show is embroiled in a fakery row after two contestants accused bosses of cheating them out of £ 22,000 in prize money			1
the women , who appeared on last night ’s episode of ‘ @entity10 ’ , have revealed that the end of the show was secretly changed to produce different results			1
friends @entity14 and @entity16 say the @entity3 ’s decision to alter the ending has denied them prize - money and betrayed viewers			1
it is not something i would ever have expected from the @entity3 and people need to know the truth			1
’ the @entity35 can reveal the show , broadcast to millions of viewers , was in fact filmed twice – and the contestants were ordered not to tell anyone			1
the two versions , with different end results , were then put together and broadcast as a single , continuous episode			0
@entity14 , also 40 , said : ‘ we had no expectations of winning but what we did expect was fair play			1
' instead , they have made it look like the whole thing had been filmed on one day – it is plain trickery			2
' we even had to wear the same clothes and have our hair exactly the same			0
the whole thing was completely staged			0
’ last night ’s tv audience witnessed @entity16 , a mother - of three , and @entity14 dramatically lose out on £ 44,000 in the final round of the tense game show presented by @entity58			1
however , the pair , from @entity60 , @entity61 , have revealed the ending shown on @entity63 last night was ‘ switched ’ from the original and the rules were changed			2
if the same rules had applied to both episodes , they would have won £ 22,000			0
last night 's tv audience witnessed @entity16 , a mother - of three , and @entity14 , both from @entity60 , @entity61 , dramatically lose out on £ 44,000 in the final round of the tense game show presented by @entity58 ( above ) @entity16 said : ‘ we got a call from @entity71 , the producer , literally the day after we had come all the way back to @entity61 to say they had decided the format was too difficult and they wanted to change the rules			1
' however , in order for that to happen he said they needed us to fly back to @entity81 that night – which was the last thing we wanted to do			2
and he kept specifying on the phone , you must not tell anybody			0
’ under the initial rules , the pair of contestants who make it to the final both had to push separate buttons at the same time in order to win prize - money accrued in the safe			1
only @entity14 had succeeded , meaning the friends had initially walked away with nothing			1
but the day after they had filmed the first episodes on june 26 , the production company admitted to the contestants the ‘ flawed ’ format made it ‘ impossible ’ to win			2
under the new rules , only one contestant needed to hit the button to win half the prize money – meaning the @entity61 pair had been entitled to £ 22,000 prize money the first time			1
‘ the new rules meant we had won the first time , so we thought they just wanted to re-shoot the final scene to show that , ’ said @entity14 , a primary school teacher			1
‘ instead they made us do the final round all over again			0
the crew kept drilling us about what we could say and what we could n’t say			0
they even styled our hair exactly the same and made us say exactly the same lines as if we were actors			0
it was all about deceiving the audience			0
’ @entity16 added : ‘ it was done in front of a skeleton audience of about 50 people at the most			2
all morning they said they were in a complete panic about finding people to sit in the audience			0
they were phoning friends and family and just grabbing people off the streets			0
the whole atmosphere was a sham			0
’ @entity14 said : ‘ by that time , there was no natural reaction from either of us because it felt like a staged moment			2
we were expected to act out a natural , impromptu scene but we could n’t because we are n’t actors			0
we came off the set feeling that we ’d been used by the @entity3 to help fix their failed format			2
we went back to the hotel and cried			0
’ after returning to @entity61 ‘ physically and emotionally exhausted ’ , @entity14 contacted the @entity3 to express her frustration at their treatment , and even asked for their episode to be scrapped			1
the @entity3 last night denied any wrongdoing and said the show had fully complied with their editorial guidelines			1
‘ this is absolutely not a deception of viewers or contestants , ’ said a spokeswoman .			0

friends @entity14 and @entity16 say @entity3 ’s decision to alter last night 's ending has denied them prize - money and betrayed viewers
