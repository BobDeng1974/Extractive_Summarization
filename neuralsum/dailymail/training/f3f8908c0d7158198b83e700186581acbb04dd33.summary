by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity2 chairman @entity1 , whose controversial @entity3 is causing major ructions , has now antagonised the @entity5 by bringing forward publication of the findings			1
@entity1 had been expected to delay the launch until next week so as not to deflect attention from the @entity5 climax on sunday			2
controversy : @entity2 chairman @entity1 will present his recommendations at @entity13 on thursday but instead @entity1 , having received unanimous support from the @entity2 board , will present his recommendations at @entity13 on thursday - much to the annoyance of the top flight , who had been told that their last set of fixtures would be fully respected			1
relations between the @entity2 and @entity5 - not great at the best of times - have been further strained by the belief at @entity25 that they have not been properly consulted during the @entity3 process			1
they have not even been sent a full copy of the report			0
concern : @entity5 fear @entity3 report could deflect attention from the climax on sunday however , the @entity2 insist the @entity5 , who have two representatives on their board , have been kept fully in the loop with numerous meetings and all available literature			1
the feeling on the @entity2 board was that parts of the @entity3 report were already in the public domain			2
so , rather than let opponents drip - feed further information , it was better to get everything out in the open			0
there are fears at @entity51 that numerous staff will be axed in a purge by new owner @entity54			1
purge : @entity54 has been at @entity51 conducting a root and branch investigation @entity60 - based @entity59 , who took over the club last month , has been at @entity63 conducting a root and branch investigation			1
and the @entity65 has decided there needs to be a major streamlining of the workforce , with the academy operation one of the areas that will be hit hardest , along with management and administrative staff			0
@entity78 , as if they have n't got enough sports @entity75 operatives running around , for some reason allowed @entity79 ( above ) to have his agent @entity80 and publicist @entity81 present in media interviews at their @entity84 launch			2
@entity81 even intervened in the press questioning because he felt there had been too much talk about @entity88			0
@entity89 , the most ridiculed member of @entity1 's @entity3 , has gone native to the extent of describing newspaper stories revealing some of the proposals in advance of thursday 's launch as ' selfish and irresponsible '			1
@entity95 , who said he had attended 25 commission meetings , has totally bought into @entity1 's blueprint , claiming everyone needs to read the full 50 - page report to understand the nuances			2
' this is the way forward , ' said @entity1 's disciple			0
@entity103 trains on at @entity104 @entity105 is preparing for his first @entity3 match as a @entity78 co-commentator - the @entity84 opener against @entity109 on june 14 , likely to be watched by an audience of 15 million - with all the dedication he showed in his playing career			1
dedication : @entity105 has completed five trial runs at matches to prepare for being @entity78 co-commentator @entity105 has completed five trial runs at matches with gantry colleague @entity118 , attended @entity78 speech tutoring and done plenty of homework on the opposition			1
he has also tapped into the knowledge of brother @entity124 , who regularly fills the same difficult role for @entity126			2
@entity127 , the new commissioner of the @entity128 , has earned deserved acclaim for throwing the book at @entity132 owner @entity131 over his racist comments			0
but it is @entity127 's long - time predecessor @entity135 who is being honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the sport industry @entity137 tonight			0
not so easy to understand is how the @entity138 can be in the running for governing body of the year after the @entity141 debacle , or troubled @entity88 for best brand			0
the @entity143 brought in leading sports architect @entity144 , designer of the @entity145 , to support their case at yesterday 's @entity147 to stick with 85cm of leg room in the proposed @entity150 renovation at @entity151			0
but the committee suffered an embarrassing defeat , with members voting by a 70 per cent majority for 90cm between the rows .			0

@entity2 chairman @entity1 will present his recommendations at @entity13 on thursday
relations between the @entity2 and @entity5 have been strained further by decision
@entity51 staff fear *job* cuts in purge by new owner @entity54
@entity105 has asked brother @entity124 for help as he prepares for first @entity3 match as a @entity78 co-commentator
