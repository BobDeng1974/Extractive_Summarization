' our main priority has always been , and will continue to be , the safety of children in our care			0
' mrs @entity0 said : ' i am just so pleased that the little person has fought against all odds and won			1
' at the end of the day i took them on because while i know my son has done wrong - i 'm not disputing that and have never condoned his crime - it was his crime , not mine			2
' i had worked at the school for ten years , i loved it there and my little girl loved it there before she died			1
now i ca n't look at it in the same way			0
