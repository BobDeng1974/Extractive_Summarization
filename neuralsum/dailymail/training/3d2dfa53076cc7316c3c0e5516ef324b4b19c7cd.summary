by @entity0 published : 10:50 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 12:30 est , 19 july 2013 runaway school girl @entity1 gave her first tv interview today and revealed she feels ashamed of her behaviour and must now take responsibility for her ' selfish outburst '			1
the teenager from @entity7 , @entity8 , went missing earlier this week after fleeing from her mother with @entity10 can @entity11 , 22 , while on holiday at the @entity14 holiday resort of @entity15			1
she was found by police four days later trying to hitch a ride with can more than 40 miles from where they was last seen			2
she was reunited with her distraught mother @entity20 , 39 , right away and , now back in the @entity22 , the pair appeared on @entity24 's @entity23			1
she explained : ' when i woke up i did n't have plans to run away			1
it was just planned and done in half an hour			2
' @entity1 said she had argued with her mother about returning to the @entity22 as she wanted to stay on in @entity14 with her grandmother			1
but @entity20 said she was so concerned about her daughter 's proximity to can - who she had seen slap another girl in a bar - she did not want to leave @entity52 behind			1
' i could n't leave her knowing what he could do , ' @entity20 said			1
@entity1 vented her anguish by messaging can on @entity57 complaining about having to leave and he told her she did n't have to			2
not long after he was outside her hotel in his car			2
sympathy : presenter @entity61 said it must have been a ' scary ' time for @entity20 ' when i got in the car it was a thrill but at the same time crazy , ' she admitted			1
' i did n't really know what i was doing			2
' @entity20 said she chased the car down the road in her tankini and flip flops and then rushed to the police station to report her daughter missing			1
she said : ' i had to be calmed down i was just beside myself			0
i never dreamt she would do something like this , she 's always been a really good , homely girl , it was out of character			2
' presenter @entity61 sympathised saying : ' it must have been so scary for you , as a mother myself you just worry so much			0
' when asked by the former @entity80 why she did n't contact her mother to let her know she was safe , @entity1 said : ' later on i was hoping to be found because i was too ashamed to ring home			1
i knew she would forgive me but i was too ashamed			0
' i knew what she must have been going through but it was a selfish outburst i do n't really know what took over			1
' smiling again : the mother said they wo n't be returning to @entity14 when asked how she managed during her days on the run with can , she said : ' we did n't have any money , i sold a gold ring for Â£ 10 that got us some food to get by but apart from that we had no money			1
we stayed at different , horrible places			0
we did n't have much to eat just enough to keep going			0
' the @entity14 waiter , who has been to prison six times , has been released by police after @entity1 decided not to press charges			0
she said they did not have sex and he did not force her to run away			0
she explained : ' i went willingly and it was my idea			0
even though he 's older and people will say he should know better it was also my fault and i have to take responsibility for that so i do n't think he should go to jail			2
' no charges : @entity1 said it would n't be right for @entity11 to go to jail because it was her idea to run away photos have already emerged of can back on the prowl in @entity15 as it was revealed yesterday that he is unrepentant			1
he is reported to have said that @entity119 girls were ' easy ' and claimed he would run away with @entity1 or another @entity119 girl , as long as they were over 18 - the @entity14 age of consent			0
' i am in love with the girl next to me , ' he said			0
' when she leaves there is always another one			0
girls love a bad boy and that is me			0
girls get boring and i can not stay with just one for more than a few weeks			0
' however , @entity20 said she wo n't be putting her daughter into that situation again			1
' we wo n't be going back to @entity14 , ' she said .			0
