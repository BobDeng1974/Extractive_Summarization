@entity0 continued his fine form ahead of the @entity2 by scoring the winner as @entity4 beat @entity5 in their penultimate warm - up friendly in @entity8			1
the @entity10 striker settled a contest that never truly ignited when he tapped in after five minutes following quick - thinking from @entity12 to square the ball with the goalkeeper closing in			1
@entity16 ’s team dominated possession from start to finish and would have settled the contest long before half - time if @entity21 had not been wasteful in front of goal			2
opener : @entity0 scores the first in the @entity26 ' friendly against @entity5 way to go : @entity28 's strike is sure to please new @entity10 boss @entity16 power : @entity28 holds off @entity5 's @entity30 at @entity32 stadium in @entity8 @entity4 : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity12 ( @entity40 81 ) , @entity41 , @entity21 , @entity28 ( c ) ( @entity42 73 ) substitutes not used : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 scorer : @entity28 5 @entity5 : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 90 ) , @entity59 ( @entity60 68 ) , @entity61 ( c ) ( @entity62 46 ) , @entity63 , @entity64 ( @entity65 62 ) , @entity66 , @entity65 ( @entity67 55 ) , @entity68 ( @entity69 46 ) substitutes not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 referee : @entity80 ( @entity81 ) in the week @entity28 claimed he would ‘ walk on fire ’ for @entity10 ’s next manager , his goalscoring record stood at five in 213 minutes for club and country - either side of his injury lay - off - when he found the net early on			1
the @entity26 captain was the spearhead of a flexible formation set up by @entity93 that was ostensibly 5 - 3 - 2 but became 3 - 5 - 2 or 3 - 4 - 3 when wing - backs @entity94 and @entity34 bombed forward			0
if @entity93 brings such a system to the @entity99 next season , we ’ll certainly be in for some fun and games			0
it may have ensured @entity4 plenty of the ball but they could n’t raise the game beyond a staccato rhythm and chances were frustratingly short in supply			2
@entity21 was the worst culprit , sending the ball wide from all of three yards after @entity38 had sprinted to the byline and delivered the perfect cross on 11 minutes			0
he was guilty of squandering another sitter when @entity34 set him clear with a low cross-field ball from the right , the @entity5 goalkeeper @entity54 staying on his feet to block			2
hit and miss : @entity21 ( right ) makes his way past @entity120 but has a mixed night in @entity4 eyes on the ball : @entity123 ( right ) battles @entity58 for the ball during the friendly and on the stroke of half - time , @entity21 saw an angled drive palmed away by the keeper after one of his thigh - pumping runs had worked a shooting opportunity			1
in the second - half , he curled a free - kick over the bar and forced @entity54 into a block at his near post after stealing into the box as it turned into a one - man show			0
substitute @entity123 , who replaced @entity28 with 17 minutes remaining , fired wide in the last few minutes but a second was n’t forthcoming			0
@entity93 had surprisingly culled his provisional squad of 29 to 23 on the morning of the match and he will need his chosen ones to find a bit more cutting edge when they line up against @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 in an awkward @entity2 group			1
@entity5 , meanwhile , were desperately disappointing and failed to create a meaningful chance all night			0
this was as comfortable as one - nil wins come and they seriously need some impetus before tackling a @entity2 group that contains @entity81 and @entity157			0
frustrated : @entity21 was n't his usual self for the @entity4 but van @entity16 's men won their penultimate friendly on his way : this will be @entity16 's final tournament with @entity4 as he prepares to take the helm at @entity10			1

@entity0 netted after just five minutes to give @entity4 and new @entity10 manager @entity16 a 1 - 0 win over @entity5
it was @entity4 's penultimate friendly before *joining* @entity171 with @entity148 , @entity150 and @entity149 in @entity172
