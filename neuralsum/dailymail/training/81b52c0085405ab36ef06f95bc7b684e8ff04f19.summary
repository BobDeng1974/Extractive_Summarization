@entity0 has become the first state in @entity2 to pass legislation allowing people and businesses to refuse to work with or serve gays if their religion forbids or disapproves of homosexuality			1
the @entity10 opposition called the proposal ' state - sanctioned discrimination ' and an embarrassment and claimed that it would hurt the economy			1
' this bill is about going after the rights of the lgbt community in @entity0 , ' said representative @entity18 , the leader of the @entity10 opposition			2
' this is going to be horrible for our economy			0
' @entity22 minority leader @entity18 ( with microphone ) says that a new bill would discriminate against gays and others			0
the legislation is designed to allow people and businesses to refuse to serve or work with gays if they find homosexuality against their religious beliefs if accepted , the bill will put the state back into the forefront of controversial law debate , four years after the national uproar it caused with an immigration crackdown			1
other states - @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 - have brought in religious legislation but @entity0 is the only one to pass			1
@entity45 claim the bill is about protecting religious freedom and not discrimination , they mentioned the case of a @entity50 photographer who was sued after refusing to take wedding pictures of a gay couple			1
in favour : @entity45 @entity54 spoke in favour of the legislation that @entity57 said was ' discriminatory ' the bill allows any business , church or person to use the law as a defence in any action brought by the government or individual claiming discrimination			1
the bill is backed by the @entity68 , a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage			0
the group says the proposal is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts and simply clarifies existing state law			0
all but three @entity45 in the @entity22 voted in favour of the bill			2
and the @entity76 passed it the day before			0
in 2008 , @entity0 voted to ban same - sex marriage but there is no guarantee that the bill will pass as @entity81 governor @entity81 vetoed a similar measure last year			2
republicans said it was simply an added protection for the faithful in the state who disapprove of gay marriage and want to be able to reject participating .			0

legislation dismissed as ' state - sanctioned discrimination '
@entity45 claim bill is about protecting religious freedom
