@entity0 possessed the most @entity2 starting xi of any @entity4 team in the last round of games , with seven players in @entity9 's team eligible to play for @entity11 's men			1
@entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 meet the criteria for selection , with none of the xi who played against @entity24 on saturday , march 21 drawn from outside the @entity25			0
however , none of that @entity2 contingent have yet featured in one of @entity11 's senior squads			2
the pool of @entity2 talent has again been in the spotlight over the last fortnight with @entity35 chairman @entity34 announcing changes to the work permit system and proposals to increase the number of homegrown players in @entity4 squads , all with a view to boosting @entity2 's performance at major tournaments			1
@entity17 ( right ) was among seven @entity2 players to take to the field against @entity24 on march 21 @entity0 boss @entity9 regularly flies the flag for @entity2 by starting a majority of @entity2 players @entity2 and @entity51 striker @entity50 was one of six @entity54 players to feature against @entity55 @entity50 - held up by @entity34 as the sort of talent whose development must not be stifled by foreign imports - heads a six - strong group who featured for @entity51 against @entity55 , including fellow new call - up @entity62 , while five of the @entity65 team which won at @entity66 were @entity2 internationals			1
at the bottom end of the chart are the leading two teams in the @entity4 , @entity71 and @entity72			2
central defensive pair @entity73 and @entity74 were part of @entity77 's defence as they won 3 - 2 at @entity79 - another team with just two @entity2 - qualified starters - while @entity72 had only @entity82 and retired @entity2 midfielder @entity83 in their xi. @entity86 manager @entity85 has been credited for adding a greater @entity2 element to his side in recent years , but the team which won at @entity90 featured only two who would qualify - @entity92 and @entity93			1
@entity71 's duo of @entity74 ( centre ) and @entity73 were the only @entity2 players to start against @entity79 overall , only 81 of the 220 @entity4 starters in the last round of matches were eligible for @entity2 selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent			1
@entity2 face @entity101 on tuesday night , and the proportion of players in @entity104 starting line - ups who were born in @entity101 - or have otherwise represented @entity101 at senior level - over the same weekend was 43.2 per cent			2
that proportion would increase still further if you included those who may qualify under residency rules or those - typically of @entity114 birth - who hold @entity116 passports due to their ancestry			0
in the @entity118 , the most ' @entity2 ' teams were @entity120 and @entity121 with nine , with a few caveats			2
@entity123 ( centre ) and @entity125 ( right ) made up nine @entity2 players to start in the derby @entity121 duo @entity128 and @entity129 both appear to have nailed their colours to the masts of the @entity133 and @entity134 respectively , yet neither has made a senior competitive appearance yet so are still technically eligible for @entity2			0
@entity136 is still @entity2 - qualified for @entity120 after he was an unused substitute in @entity134 ' @entity138 qualifier in @entity139			1
until @entity141 featured for @entity142 against @entity143 on sunday , @entity140 also had nine , with the @entity144 ' @entity133 call - up @entity146 still @entity2 - qualified as he did not feature for the @entity147 against @entity148			1
@entity150 's @entity149 fielded eleven @entity2 players in their most recent game against @entity153 also flying the flag of @entity155 with an all - @entity156 were @entity157 ( pictured ) and @entity158 the percentage of @entity2 - qualified players starting in the @entity118 was 57.2 per cent , rising to 76.1 per cent in @entity161 and 86.0 per cent in @entity150			1
five teams in @entity161 - @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 - were just one player shy of an entirely @entity2 - qualified @entity84 you had to go down to @entity150 to find a fully @entity2 - qualified xi , with @entity149 , @entity157 and @entity158 flying the flag			1
@entity158 's @entity170 has won two caps for @entity172 , but both came in the @entity174 which does not classify as an official competition under @entity177 regulations , so he technically remains eligible for @entity2			0

@entity274 * players born in @entity276 or with an @entity2 parent or grandparent qualified as @entity2 for the purposes of this survey , provided they had not played a competitive senior international for another team			2
matches for other countries at youth level , or in senior friendlies or games not classed as official competition do not make the player ineligible for @entity2			0
* @entity177 rules permit a player to gain residency after five years ' continuous living in their adopted country , provided they had not played a competitive senior international for another team			0
however , under a @entity300 agreement , it is understood the residency rules for @entity2 eligibility are different			0
