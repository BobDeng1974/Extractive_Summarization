house speaker @entity0 refused on thursday to rule out a government shutdown as a means to block president @entity3 from halting deportations for millions of illegal immigrants			1
' all options are on the table , ' @entity0 said during a press conference this afternoon , noting that @entity9 in the @entity10 are still discussing their next move and have not made any definite decisions yet			0
' our goal here is to stop the president from violating his own oath of office and violating the @entity19			2
it 's not to shut down the government , ' he said when a reporter asked him to clarify the @entity25 's intentions			1
as @entity0 walked away another reporter tried to get him to state on the record that he would not allow a government shut down , but the @entity25 leader did not respond			1
today @entity30 reported that @entity3 would implement a 10 - point plan to change the immigration system as early as next friday , leading to a renewed effort among @entity34 to use an upcoming spending debate to force @entity3 's hand			1
the sweeping order would also allow parents of both citizen children and illegal immigrant children to remain in the @entity66 portion of the directive alone could save as many as 4.5 million immigrants with @entity58 born children from being removed from the country , @entity54 estimated			1
the section extending the president 's @entity73 could protect another 300,000			0
instead of requiring that illegal immigrants applying for residency under the provision be under the age of 31 and provide proof that they arrived her before july of 2007 , anyone who came to the country before january 1 , 2010 , when they were under the age of 16 would be eligible for @entity73			1
a half - million immigrants and their spouses could apply for citizenship through a @entity88 visa program for high - tech jobs			1
not all 10 sections of the president 's plan would give cover to categories of illegal immigrants			1
one would give @entity96 officers a raise to ' increase morale , ' @entity54 said			0
another would authorize the @entity101 to ' promote ' naturalization by giving a 50 percent discount to the first 10,000 applicants , excluding illegal immigrants whose incomes are 200 percent above the federal poverty level			1
the president will likely direct @entity96 to focus on deporting criminals over other illegals , as well			0
@entity3 was reportedly briefed on a draft of the plans on his way to @entity114			1
the @entity10 has yet to give its final seal of approval , however , the source told @entity30			0
@entity10 press secretary @entity118 today told reporters traveling with the president in @entity114 that @entity3 still has n't made up his mind and would not make an announcement on immigration until after he returns to @entity124 this weekend			1
@entity118 said @entity3 is ' nearing a final decision , ' however			2
if the timing laid out it the draft proposal is accurate , executive action would come weeks sooner than anticipated			2
while the president has said he would act before the end of the year , no directive was expected to come before lawmakers had passed legislation extending funding for the government			2
the current resolution expires dec. 11 , the day before the @entity10 is scheduled to recess until the end of the current @entity139			0
interference by @entity3 will most assuredly provoke conservative legislators in the @entity10 and @entity142 who are already itching to use the spending debate to tie @entity3 's hands on immigration			1
@entity146 , his wife @entity147 , and newborn son , @entity148 are pictured together last week			0
they are among the millions of illegal immigrants that could be spared from deportation as a result of @entity3 's pending actions while @entity157 leader @entity157 has promised there will not be another government shut down , that does n't mean that anti-amnesty zealots in his caucus , who have said they will use all procedural means available to stop @entity3 , wo n't give it another try			1
@entity165 sen. @entity164 , who will likely ascend to chairman of the budget committee when republicans become the majority party next year , has said he wants to use the budget process to bar spending on any immigration reforms ordered up by @entity3 without the consent of @entity139			1
@entity174 reported this morning that @entity164 ' strategy now has the backing of 50 members of the @entity10 , making it impossible for @entity179 leadership in both chambers to ignore			0
conservatives in the @entity10 , led by @entity184 rep. rep. @entity183 , sent a letter today to @entity187 chairman @entity186 and ranking member @entity188 asking them to include language in the budget ' to prohibit the use of funds by the administration for the implementation of current or future executive actions that would create additional work permits outside of the scope prescribed by @entity139			2
' @entity199 sen. @entity198 also said in a statement today that he would support sessions			0
' i stand ready to do whatever it takes to stop amnesty by executive action or by any other means , ' he said			2
meanwhile , @entity208 rep. @entity207 said she would reintroduce legislation at the top of the new legislative session ' to freeze @entity73 ' and ban the president from using executive orders to create similar programs in the future			0
' this election was a referendum on the @entity3 doctrine of lawlessness that is cracking the foundation of our democracy and shredding the @entity19 , ' the @entity25 lawmaker said in an op - ed for @entity225			1
' the @entity58 people want it stopped , period			1
' both @entity229 and @entity10 speaker @entity0 publicly warned @entity3 last week that he would ' poison the well ' with @entity9 by acting alone on immigration , but the @entity233 president has not heeded their advice			1
in a press conference the day after the midterm elections and in an interview with @entity241 a few days later he said recommitted to issuing an executive order on immigration before the end of the calendar year			2
in a closed - door meeting with @entity9 today , @entity0 reportedly told his members that he told the president point blank last friday that , ' " if you proceed with executive amnesty , not only can you forget about getting immigration reform enacted during your presidency , you can also expect it to jeopardize other issues as well			1
" ' ' we do n’t know when exactly he ’ll do it or how exactly he ’ll do it			0
but if he proceeds , we are going to fight it , ' @entity0 promised , according to a source in the room who spoke to @entity260			0
at today 's press conference @entity0 was asked in no uncertain terms if the @entity25 would consider using the budget process to take a stand against @entity3 's planned actions , and @entity0 repeatedly said that ' all options are on the table			1
' ' i 'll just say this , we 're going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path , ' @entity0 told reporters			0
' this is the wrong way to govern , ' he added			0
' this is exactly what the @entity58 people said on election day they did n't want			2
' earlier today at his own presser @entity229 had said that there would absolutely be no government shutdown or threatening by @entity9 to default on the national debt if @entity3 disobeys , however , potentially putting him at odds with his counterpart in the @entity10			1
@entity3 is reportedly planning to allow illegal immigrants who came here as children and their parents to live and work in the @entity58 indefinitely sen. @entity289 , a former @entity290 chairman , joined in last night on calls for @entity3 to hold his fire , writing in @entity293 that ' the president ’s promise to act unilaterally in other areas will only short - circuit the statutory reforms we desperately need			1
' ' there is a viable path to meaningful immigration reform , but it does not begin with executive amnesty , ' he said			2
@entity289 pointed out that he is not against the comprehensive immigration reform measures backed by the president , and he in fact voted for them when they came before the @entity142			2
rather , he is against the ' increasingly broad carve - outs to the enforcement of our current immigration laws ' that @entity3 is considering			1
arguing that @entity3 is ' bowing to pressure from his base , and perhaps because of his own impatience , ' @entity289 said his the president 's ' promise to make further unilateral changes to our nation ’s immigration policy breeds mistrust and makes meaningful legislative reform even harder to achieve			2
' progressives within the @entity233 caucus have been pressuring @entity3 to broaden his 2012 immigration order for months , and upon their return to @entity124 after the most recent recess , they again took up the mantle			1
' we 're begging the president			0
these [ illegal immigrants ] are a plus to our nation			1
you said you were going to do something			0
act now , ' rep. @entity338 of @entity339 said wednesday			0
in an interview this morning on @entity342 rep. @entity341 said the president needs to act in a ' bold ' and ' generous ' manner before the holiday season			0
' i 've always said that the blessings of @entity347 should be bountiful this year for millions of immigrants that have been waiting for the @entity139 to act , ' @entity341 told @entity350 co-host @entity351			0
@entity341 said it was republicans who have proved the untrustworthy partner in immigration reform			0
' every time we set the menu , every time we set the table , they walked away , ' he said			0
' and they keep talking about this poison well			0
they kind of doubled down on poisoning the well			0
' republicans ' really poisoned that well ' during the midterm elections by claiming that @entity369 immigrants were coming to take @entity58 jobs , @entity365 could become an epidemic in the @entity58 and @entity372 could attack @entity58			2
still , @entity341 said , he 's ready to work with @entity9 to pass immigration reform if they 're willing to work with him			0
' and we still have time to do it , ' he said .			0

@entity3 is reportedly looking to expand his deferred action program to include any one who came to the @entity58 as a child
the sweeping order would also allow parents of both citizen children and illegal immigrant children to remain in the @entity58
as many as 4.5 million illegal immigrants with @entity58 born children could be protected
a growing number of conservatives are *pledging* to stop @entity3 by *restricting* immigration funding in an upcoming spending bill
@entity25 leader @entity157 has *explicitly* said there wo n't be another government shutdown - period
