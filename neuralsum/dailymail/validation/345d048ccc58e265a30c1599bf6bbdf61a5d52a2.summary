on the third day of her organised trip , she was in a party of 12 holidaymakers and two instructors who went to @entity49 for the last scuba dive of the day just after 3pm			2
the inquest was told she returned to the surface after about 30 minutes and asked for medical help as she was feeling unwell			2
doctors were called and she was taken to the exclusive @entity55 nearby			0
when it became clear her condition was deteriorating the resort 's doctor said she needed to be taken to a decompression chamber , but there was no transport available			1
a speed boat only arrived from neighbouring @entity64 , more than 40 miles away , when insurance checks had been carried out			0

she had been on the same holiday the previous year initially a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and it took specialist tests carried out on samples of brain tissue to detect damage caused by nitrogen bubbles being present in her blood stream			2
divers ' disease , or ' the bends ' , is a condition caused from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation			0
consultant @entity100 dr @entity99 told the hearing that the minute damage caused by the bubbles and a ruptured left ear drum suggested ms @entity0 had decompression syndrome			1
her father , @entity107 , of @entity108 , @entity42 , told the court his daughter was a qualified diving instructor and member of a club who had dived all over the world			0

due to a lack of appropriate transport at that time of day there was a delay in taking her to an appropriate facility			1
' once there , there was a partial misdiagnosis that she was not suffering from compression sickness			0
she was deemed to be too unwell to go into the chamber and was transferred to hospital ' it is possible that if her condition had been diagnosed sooner that she would not have died when she did			2
' he added : ' holidaymakers need to be aware of what emergency procedures are in place should any particular difficulties arise			0
' after the hearing @entity0 's mother @entity34 , 64 , said : ' my daughter 's death was down to sheer incompetence			1
