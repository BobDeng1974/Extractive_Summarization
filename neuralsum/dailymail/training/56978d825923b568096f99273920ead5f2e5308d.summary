' first we start with an image and a black sharpie marker			0
the image is drawn on and then the highlights are etched out with our custom carving tools			0
' the team keep carving and enhancing the displays throughout the life of the show - we expect to go through about 20,000 pumpkins during the course of the 30 day - run			2
at the end , the pumpkins are collected and composted			0
these before and after pictures show the pumpkins as they appear during the day and then the dramatic transformation that takes place at night what a difference the day makes : black metal struts are revealed during the daylight making this web much less impressive compared to the night - time version which floats in mid air toil and trouble : each of the pumpkin sculptures are hand carved by a team of expert artists ' it really is a remarkable collection that everyone involved in is extremely proud of			0
' the widely acclaimed @entity151 event uses pumpkin art to represent individual regions of the country , highlighting their unique attributes as well as historical and cultural landmarks of each of the states and unsurprisingly there are zombie scenes stretching throughout the collection to celebrate @entity162			0
