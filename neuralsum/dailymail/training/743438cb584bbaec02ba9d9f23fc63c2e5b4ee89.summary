we also appreciate all the concern , thoughts and prayers of everyone back home for the health of our daughter @entity16			2
she is doing well now , and her medical condition continues to improve			0
' we understand there are those who question our decision to sail with our family , but please know that this is how our family has lived for seven years , and when we departed on this journey more than a year ago , we were then and remain today confident that we prepared as well as any sailing crew could			2
the ocean is one of the greatest forces of nature , and it always has the potential to overcome those who live on or near it			0
we are proud of our choices and our preparation , and while we are disappointed that we lost our sailboat and our home , we remain grateful for those who came to our aid and those family and friends who continue to encourage and support us			0
' @entity10 , 68 , added : ‘ i first heard about this on saturday morning when a friend called me up and said : ‘ get ready for this ’			0
we almost passed away on the spot			0
‘ as a mother you ca n’t stop them , you ca n’t try			0
what am i going to do ? take away his ( @entity9 ’s ) ice - cream ? ‘ it ’s unfortunate but what can you do about it ? i ’m sorry it happened and i ’m sorry for the expense ’			2
@entity9 ’s step - father @entity148 , 78 , added that he thought that sailing would have been a ‘ fantastic education ’ for @entity9 ’s children and that the trip had been planned for years			1
he said : ‘ these people who say they should not have done that ( the trip ) - why not ? why should n’t a person live his life to the fullest and do what they can do ? ’ speaking to @entity158 , who has spoken to @entity37 as she sails back on the @entity62 , said that her sibling feels that they ‘ did everything right ’			1
she said : ‘ it ’s just one of those things ; people sail all the time around the world , they were just on the ship where it went wrong			2
‘ i would not be surprised if in the future there is another sailing trip , but that ’s their choice			2
’ @entity158 said that the trip was ‘ not something that i would ever do ’ but that @entity9 ’s background in the @entity3 and their planning had reassured her			2
the couple ’s main concern now is the fate of the @entity50 , which was sunk by the @entity3 as it was taking on water			0
@entity158 said : ‘ they are in shock about losing their boat			0
it was their home for six years			0
it ’s the equivalent of somebody watching their house burn down			0
’ sick bay : @entity37 and @entity16 , who had a rash all over			1
it is believed she had a relapse of salmonella poisoning - which she had suffered from before they left day one i can see the magic of being out to sea , but i ca n’t really taste it			1
our children keep us too grounded to enjoy the esoterics of salty breezes , gigantic swells undulating around your boat like an erotic hula dancer , and a night sky dancing with laser beams of @entity217 our foresail , stay sail , and main sail , hold fast , all strong and white , like our painted wooden mast , and i can feel their excitement to be used like this again ; they were made for blue - water sailing , and apparently , so were @entity202 started out sh * * * * too			0
it is so hard to keep a positive outlook at sea when you feel @entity226 i ca n’t possibly describe the range of emotions i have felt so far : anger , joy , sickness , exhaustion , exhilaration , wonder , awe , contentment , @entity236 eight i think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done ... [ but ] not everyone gets to realize their dreams in @entity243 when i woke up this morning my back muscles were tight from the constant rocking you ca n’t escape at @entity245 days at sea ... we are in good spirits , as good as you can be , considering.three days later the family contacted the @entity21 for help @entity9 and @entity37 ’s odyssey began when they left @entity68 in 2012 and went to @entity253 in @entity254 to deliver @entity16			1
they had to wait another year for good weather to cross the @entity6			0
critics have not been quite so charitable , however , and pointed out that @entity16 was sick with salmonella just a week before her parents set sail on their trans - @entity6 journey			1
a doctor had given her a clean bill of health but when the salmonella returned they had to call for help because the antibiotics they were using had no effect			0
the @entity3 and the @entity21 have declined to reveal the cost of the whole rescue operation , which will be almost a week long once finished			1
@entity9 and @entity37 will speak to the media upon their return but for now have released a statement which they sent via the captain of the @entity62			1
it read : ‘ we are proud of our choices and our preparation , and while we are disappointed that we lost our sailboat and our home , we remain grateful for those who came to our aid and those family and friends who continue to encourage and support us ’			0
critics called the family ‘ reckless ’ and said that they should have put their children first			0
captain @entity292 , the former captain of the @entity293 and the @entity294 , told @entity1 : ‘ my opinion is that that exercised poor judgement and that having to call for help could cause other ships to put themselves in danger			1
‘ they may be able to sail across the @entity6 , but i would call into question their judgement			0
’ captain @entity292 added that if it was his ship that was responding to the emergency call and he found out what happened he would be ‘ disgusted ’ at the couple			1
rough seas : @entity9 and @entity37 have faced criticism over their trip - not least from their family			1
but they have defended their actions @entity9 and @entity37 are unlikely to have to pay for the rescue as the @entity21 does not charge for search and rescue operations			1
whilest the @entity3 has not revealed how much the operation cost , given the distances and the resources involved it will be hundreds of thousands of dollars .			0

@entity37 and @entity9 deny they put their 1 - year - old girl @entity16 in danger by taking her on their round - the - world trip
@entity9 's mother told @entity1 that while she supported his trip , she hopes it is the end of their adventures
but @entity37 's sister , @entity41 , said she would n't be surprised if they headed back out to sea
@entity340 captain @entity292 said he ' questions their judgment and poor *seamanship* '
@entity62 was sent in to help *airlift* one - year - old @entity346 to safety after parents raised the alarm on thursday
sailors helped the family onto an inflatable raft and then took them aboard the *warship* around 8 am local time sunday
@entity16 is now *recovering* . family believe she had a relapse of salmonella poisoning
it appears that they will not be billed for the huge rescue operation
