a model who suffered years of being teased about her height has beaten her bullies to become a @entity6 lookalike			1
@entity7 was constantly picked on by her classmates for being ' too tall and nerdy ' but now says she ca n't leave the house without being stopped for autographs			1
the 37 - year - old was bullied while at school in @entity13 and the name calling and snide whispering was so vicious that used to suffer panic attacks before going to class			1
@entity7 has launched a career as a @entity6 ( pictured ) lookalike after being bullied but @entity7 , who lives in @entity19 , has since conquered the bullies and has carved out a successful career in modelling and being the supermodel 's lookalike			1
the model says that she could never have imagined such a turnaround after her bullies had left her confidence at an all - time low			0
' i was constantly bullied at school - i was always tall and used to tower above most of the older boys , let alone girls my age , and i wore these thick glasses			0
as a child @entity7 , pictured left , had always towered over her school friends and had worn thick glasses but after growing up , right , and moving to @entity38 people constantly remarked on her likeness to @entity6 @entity7 says she can rarely walk down the street without being stopped for autographs ' this one girl - who thought she was a top dog - was always calling me names like " freak " and " nerd " and she used to lead everyone in whispering behind my back			1
' @entity7 says that the jibes may have sounded tame but as a child they had really taken their toll			0
' it does n't sound much , but when you 're younger and just want to fit in the constant whispering and teasing caused me to have panic attacks every day before school			0
' it was horrible and really knocked my confidence at the time but looking back it has made me a stronger person - all i think now is look at me now ! ' when people first remarked on @entity7 's resemblance to @entity6 ( right ) she had no idea who the supermodel was but after looking her up @entity7 signed up to an agency and never looked back @entity7 says that since @entity6 has been less of a diva she has seen her bookings slow down in 1997 , at the age of 20 , @entity7 moved from @entity13 to @entity73 at the height of @entity6 's catwalk career			1
the town of @entity38 was a far cry from the runways of @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 - but was still stared at in the street			0
astonishingly , at that time @entity7 had no idea who the supermodel was so could not work out why she was receiving so much attention			2
' when all these people stared at me i thought there was something wrong with me ! as well as being approached by fans , @entity7 says she has received a few negative comments when being mistaken for @entity6 ' i had no clue until one day , about a year after i 'd arrived , this woman came up to me and told me i looked like @entity6			1
' i just said " who ? " but when i looked it up i was flattered and started doing lookalike work			0
' soon after noticing her resemblance to @entity6 , @entity7 put her career into motion and has never looked back			1
' i signed up with the @entity101 modelling agency in @entity102 , and i have been in work ever since			0
' for the past 15 years @entity7 has been hired to turn up at functions and events in stretch limos and be ' papped ' on the red carpet			2
@entity7 even claims that at one event where she was surrounded by bodyguards , who took their role so seriously they even followed her into the toilet			0
as the supermodel - the first black model to cover @entity116 in 1988 - has calmed down and shied away from the press , lookalike work has slowed for @entity7			1
' she 's been a bit less of a diva recently though - i need her to throw some more phones so the calls start coming back in ! ' still @entity7 says she is stopped in the street on the daily - even if she is just out shopping with her partner and her daughter @entity124 , 13			2
' there is n't a day goes by where i 'm not told i look like her - if i had a pound for every time that happened i 'd have as much money as her ! ' whenever we go on holiday i 'm always stopped for autographs - it probably does n't help that i 'm wearing sunglasses which makes me look more of a diva ! ' i had one woman stop me in the airport and ask for my autograph for her daughter as she was a big fan - even after i told her i was n't @entity6			2
' as well as admiration @entity7 says that her likeness to the super model has seen her deal with some negative comments			0
' on the other hand , another woman shouted at me at the races the other day because she did n't believe i was n't @entity6 and said i was lying and being a b * * * * and a diva ! ' sometimes i just ca n't win , but i try not to complain - there are worse people to look like ! '			0
