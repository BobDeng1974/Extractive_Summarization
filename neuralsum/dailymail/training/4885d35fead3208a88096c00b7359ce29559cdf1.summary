the number of patients spending more than four hours at accident and emergency departments in @entity4 has risen to the highest level in five years			1
nearly a fifth of all people arriving at @entity9 are facing waits in excess of the gold standard , four hours , as winter pressures continue their grip on the @entity14			1
during the busiest december the health service has seen in five years , 81 per cent of patients were assessed , treated and then admitted or discharged within within four hours of arriving at @entity9			1
ministers , who have pledged to spend an extra £ 40 million to help the @entity14 deal with the surge in demand , blamed an increase in admissions			1
nearly a fifth of patients at @entity9 are facing waits in excess of four hours as winter pressures grip the @entity14 in @entity4 with ambulances left queuing outside deparments , including that at @entity28 in @entity29 opposition parties have been fiercely critical of the new data - claiming it was further proof of the @entity34 administration in @entity36 's poor record on health			1
the deputy minister for health , @entity38 , praised the work of @entity14 staff during a period of immense pressure , with 76,889 people visiting emergency departments across the country			2
but the figures laid bare the challenges facing the health service , with 2,490 people waiting longer than 12 hours to be seen			1
the number of people attending a&es in december was up 2.5 per cent on december 2013			1
and it marked the highest number of attendances per day in any december since 2009			2
mr @entity38 said : ' these figures show eight out of 10 people who went to @entity9 were assessed , treated and then admitted or discharged in less than four hours during december			1
' while different reporting mechanisms make it difficult to make direct comparisons with other parts of the @entity63 , it is clear all health services are experiencing significant pressures			2
' i would like to thank everyone within the @entity14 for their unrelenting commitment to patient care during this difficult period			0
' we have announced an extra £ 40 million to help the @entity14 deal with winter pressures			1
' this means we have invested a further quarter of a billion pounds in the @entity14 in 2014 - 15 to continue to deliver high - quality , sustainable health services			0
' the best - performing @entity9 department was @entity77 in @entity78 , with 90.7 per cent of people seen within the four hour target window			0
@entity83 's @entity82 hospital had the lowest figure at 65.6 per cent			0
the news comes in the same week a senior @entity34 nurse described the pressure on @entity9 staff as more stressful than treating soldiers on the front line in @entity91			1
welsh ministers have pledged an extra £ 40 million to ease the pressures but @entity95 politicians in opposition have said the move is ' too little too late ' the @entity98 , the second largest party in the @entity99 , said @entity34 ministers needed to set out swift and detailed plans to turn the situation around			1
@entity104 health minister @entity103 said : ' december 's atrocious performance is among the worst since current records began and it confirms that patients and staff are paying a high price for @entity34 's record - breaking cuts to the @entity14 budget			1
a senior nurse working in @entity9 at the @entity113 in @entity29 gave a brutal account of life on the front line of the @entity14			0
having treated injured soldiers during the second @entity91 war in 2003 , the nurse , who was not named , claimed the pressure staff are facing in @entity9 at the moment is worse than that in a warzone			0
extracts from her three - page account of one shift , which was pinned to a staff noticeboard in the hospital and leaked to the press , reads : ' arrived at 7pm to a department of 60 patients , 43 to be seen			2
most areas of @entity9 are full and no beds allocated			0
' there were five ambulances outside with 15 presented majors patients to be triaged			2
throughout the night we had 125 patients through , on top of the 60 to begin with			2
' young pregnant woman was bleeding heavily			0
on walking into the triage room , she miscarried on the floor and passed the foetus at the feet of the triage nurse			0
' we had nowhere private to take her and had to pick up everything from the floor in front of her and scoop it into a pot. ' ' arrival of ambulance crews was relentless overnight and we had multiple offload delays			0
' in order to avert long delays , i had to think about what patient i could offload and what patient absolutely needed to stay on a truck and have continual monitoring			0
' ' the existing targets have not been met in well over five years and lie significantly behind performance in @entity165			1
' this week 's announcement of £ 40 million to support winter pressures in @entity4 was too little and too late			1
' another @entity14 bailout at the 11th hour does not allow @entity169 to plan properly for effective spending and it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the frontline in the current bleak mid-winter			0
' @entity176 am @entity175 countered @entity178 suggestions the latest failure to meet @entity9 target times were because of an increase			0
she said : ' demand for services has been within a consistent margin for many years			2
' it is clear therefore the failure to meet these targets is not down to the number of people coming through the door , but indicative of a deeper problem that lies in the flow of patients through hospital			2
' ms @entity175 added a major recruitment drive for more doctors was desperately needed			0
welsh @entity197 leader @entity196 said : ' anyone who read the letter from the @entity9 nurse , who compared working in a @entity9 to working in a war zone , would be moved by the dedication and commitment of our @entity14 staff			0
' however , they are being held back by the @entity208			0
' what is clear to me is that the @entity14 is too big an issue to be left to one party			0
what we need is a cross-party and no - party commission , working with health professionals and patients , to look into the future of our nhs and how it can meet the severe challenges it faces in the future			2
' the @entity14 in @entity165 has the same 95 per cent target as @entity4 but its figures are published weekly during winter			1
today the figures covering the week until january 11 revealed 89.8 per cent of people were seen within four hours across @entity165 .			1

81 *%* of patients were seen within four hours at @entity231 in @entity4 in december
@entity235 worst waiting time performance for five years , figures show
@entity34 government has pledged extra £ 40 million to help ease pressures
but *conservatives* in opposition say it is ' too little too late '
