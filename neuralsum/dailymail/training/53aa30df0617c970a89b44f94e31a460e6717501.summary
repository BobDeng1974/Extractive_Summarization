by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 05:40 est , 30 may 2012 climate change sceptics are often derided as uninformed - but a new study proves that the opposite is the case			1
sceptical individuals are slightly more science literate than ' believers ' in climate change			1
the difference is n't huge , according to a survey of 1500 @entity12 adults			1
57 % of sceptics are ' science literate ' according to tests asking basic science and maths questions , versus 56 % of believers			1
@entity18 activists : sceptical individuals are slightly more science literate than ' believers ' in climate change @entity21 , professor of psychology at @entity22 said , ' political controversy over climate change can not be attributed to the public 's limited ability to comprehend science			2
researchers measured ‘ science literacy ’ with test items developed by the @entity30			0
the questions were simple questions such as ' electrons are smaller than atoms , true or false ? ' they also measured their subjects ' ‘ numeracy ’ — that is , their ability to understand quantitative information			0
the controversy comes down , in effect , to a conflict over values - and informed individuals are better at fitting the scientific facts , and gaps in our knowledge , to whatever they happen to believe in			2
the questions were simple questions such as ' electrons are smaller than atoms , true or false ? ' in case you 're puzzled , the electrons are on the outside ‘ in effect , ’ @entity21 said , ‘ ordinary members of the public credit or dismiss scientific information on disputed issues based on whether the information strengthens or weakens their ties to others who share their values			0
' at least among ordinary members of the public , individuals with higher science comprehension are even better at fitting the evidence to their group commitments			2
’ ‘ more information can help solve the climate change conflict , ’ @entity21 said , ‘ but that information has to do more than communicate the scientific evidence			0
it also has to create a climate of deliberations in which no group perceives that accepting any piece of evidence is akin to betrayal of their cultural group			0

57 % of sceptics are science - literate vs 56 % of believers

science - literate *people* are better at ' fitting ' information to beliefs
