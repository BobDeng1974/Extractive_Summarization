by @entity0 published : 07:13 est , 22 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:28 est , 22 february 2014 two brothels in @entity5 's red light district will reopen after a judge rejected police claims women working there were being ' controlled or incited into prostitution '			1
more than 200 police swooped on @entity5 's infamous @entity12 last december , raiding around 20 flats			1
officers had raised fears that the prostitutes were being controlled for gain - which is illegal			1
the raids were hugely controversial , sparking protests in the area attended by @entity22 actor @entity21 , who branded the raids a ' land grab facilitated by the police '			0
a judge has quashed closure orders on two brothels in the @entity30 area of @entity5 ( pictured ) after police evidence workers were being controlled for gain was thrown out but in a victory for campaigners , recorder @entity33 quashed the closure orders on two of the flats in @entity40			1
this means the sex workers can now move back in			1
giving his ruling at @entity45 the judge rejected police evidence the women were being controlled or incited into prostitution for gain			1
he said : ' the furthest the evidence goes is to show that the @entity52 used the first and second floor flats for prostitution by arrangement with other sex workers at mutually convenient and agreed times			1
' he said this ' does not constitute control ' withing the meaning of the law			0
the @entity61 , which has led opposition to the controversial raids , have hailed the ruling a ' victory for common sense '			0
sex workers will now be able to return to work in the two brothels in @entity5 's @entity12 ( pictured ) @entity70 who has worked at the premises for five years , said : ' i am very pleased that justice was served			1
' the police should be ashamed of themselves to accuse us of being controlled when they know very well we are not			2
' nobody tells me when and how long to work			0
to the judge i say that he is welcome to come down and see us girls in @entity30 at any time ... for a cup of tea			2
' @entity82 , from the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) said : ' these closures should never have come to court			0
' the police misled the public and claimed that they were needed to prevent rape and trafficking			0
no victims of trafficking were found ; instead the police threw women out of the relative safety of their flats			2
' this decision is timely as women have been without an income since the beginning of december			0
many are in debt and some were about to be made homeless			0
recorder @entity33 made the ruling at @entity45 ( pictured ) , rejecting police evidence women were being controlled or incited into prostitution for gain @entity105 , also from the @entity61 , said : ' we are delighted			1
the ruling is extremely important because the police were saying there was some invisible figure who was organising how long the girls worked , how much they charged , and said that constituted control			1
the women came to court and said that is not right			0
but if this is all the police need to show control they can shut down any business in the country - they would n't need to show force or coercion			0
' the court had heard that @entity30 is one of the safest places for prostitutes to work because women do n't work alone or on the streets			2
most of the women who were evicted in @entity30 are mothers and grandmothers - and have lived in the area for decades			2
they claim they are being driven out of the area to make way for its gentrification .			0
