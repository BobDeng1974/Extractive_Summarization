by @entity0 @entity2 ’s robotic moon explorer , @entity3 , took a death dive into the lunar surface last night			1
the orbiting spacecraft crashed into the moon while travelling at speeds of 3,600 mph ( 5,800 kph ) - fast enough to be vapourised by the impact			1
no debris would have been left behind , but project scientist @entity11 predicted : ‘ it 's bound to make a dent			0
' @entity2 's small moon - orbiting spacecraft @entity3 is no more			2
flight controllers confirmed today that it crashed into the moon while travelling at speed of 3,600 mph ( 5,800 kph ) - fast enough to be vapourised by the impact by yesterday evening , the spacecraft had been skimming the lunar surface at an incredibly low altitude of 300 feet ( 100 metres )			1
its orbit had been lowered on purpose last week to ensure a crash by monday following a successful science mission			1
@entity3 - short for @entity3 - was launched in september from @entity27			0
from the outset , @entity2 planned to crash the spacecraft into the of the moon , far from the @entity32 artefacts left behind during the moonwalking days of 1969 to 1972			1

by yesterday evening , the spacecraft had been skimming the lunar surface at an incredibly low altitude of 300 ft ( 100m ) launch : sept. 6 , 2013 launch site : @entity42 , @entity27 launch vehicle : @entity44 planned mission duration : 100 days actual mission duration : 128 days mass : 844 lbs ( 383 kg ) power : 295 watts cost : £ 167 million ( $ 280 million ) mission legacy : @entity3 identified various components of the thin lunar atmosphere			1
it also studied the dusty veil surrounding the moon , created by all the surface particles kicked up by impacting micrometeorites			0
scientists hope to use the data to address a long - standing question : was lunar dust , electrically charged by sunlight , responsible for the pre-sunrise glow seen above the lunar horizon during several @entity32 missions ? @entity3 also hosted @entity2 ’s first dedicated system for two - way communication using laser instead of radio waves			1
it completed its primary 100 - day science mission last month and was on overtime			1
the extension had @entity3 flying during tuesday morning 's lunar eclipse ; its instruments were not designed to endure such prolonged darkness and cold			1
but the small spacecraft survived - it 's about the size of a vending machine - with just a couple pressure sensors acting up			0
the mood in the control centre at @entity2 ’s @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84 , was upbeat yesterday afternoon , according to project manager @entity85			2
‘ having flown through the eclipse and survived , the team is actually feeling very good , ’ mr @entity85 told the @entity86 in a phone interview			0
but the uncertainty of the timing of @entity3 ’s demise had the flight controllers ‘ on edge , ’ he said			0
as it turns out , @entity3 succumbed within several hours of mr @entity85 's comments			0
@entity2 announced its end early this morning			0
it will be at least a day or two before @entity2 knows precisely where the spacecraft ended up ; the data cutoff indicates it smashed into the far side of the moon , although just barely			2
engineers prepare to install @entity3 spacecraft into the fairing of the @entity44 launch vehicle nose - cone			0
the probe was launched in september from @entity27 @entity3 did not have enough fuel to remain in lunar orbit much beyond the end of its mission			2
it joined dozens if not scores of science satellites and @entity32 programme spacecraft parts that have slammed into the moon 's surface , on purpose , over the decades			0
until @entity3 , the most recent man - made impacts were the @entity122 crater - observing satellite that went down in 2009 and the twin grail spacecraft in 2012			2
during its £ 167 million ( $ 280 million ) mission , @entity3 identified various components of the thin lunar atmosphere - neon , magnesium and titanium , among others - and studied the dusty veil surrounding the moon , created by all the surface particles kicked up by impacting micrometeorites			1
@entity3 also hosted @entity2 ’s first dedicated system for two - way communication using laser instead of radio waves			1
‘ @entity3 ’s science cup really overfloweth , ’ mr @entity11 said earlier this month			0
‘ @entity3 , by going to the moon , has actually allowed us to visit other worlds with similar tenuous atmospheres and dusty environments			0
’ during its £ 167m ( $ 280m ) mission , @entity3 identified various components of the thin lunar atmosphere			1
