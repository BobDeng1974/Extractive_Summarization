academic achievement on @entity5 had become worse as attendance rates are high in primary school and fall away sharply during high school , a study has found the research - delivered at the @entity27 's annual conference on monday - found that a small amount of absence from school may have minimal effect on academic performance			1

' children learn their habits early so if they are taught that they need to ' show up ' for school and make that commitment from a young age then they will carry that positive mentality for the years ahead , not only at school but throughout their careers and life generally , ' she said			2
' we wanted to know how many days of absence kids could ' get away with ' before it started to affect how they were doing in at school			0
' we also found that the effect of missing days accumulated over time , so that school absence not only impacted in the year , in which the days were missed but in the future years as well			0

' a 10 day period of unathorised absence in a year is sufficient to drop a child about a band in the @entity5 testing			0
' for most children , year one sets the pattern for what school attendance will look like in the future			1
' despite all concerns on school attendance , @entity94 teacher @entity93 said the concern with children missing school should be how it affects their total school learning , not just the @entity5 results , which is a one off test every two years			1
' @entity103 is important for students ' welfare and learning the total curriculum , ' he told @entity107 .			0
