@entity1 no 1 @entity0 is finally back - to his best after an injury - plagued and frustrating 2014 , and is on the verge of rediscovering his best form – that 's according to mum @entity5			1
it has been an electric start to the new season for @entity0 – his quarter - final win against @entity9 @entity8 last month was enough to see him pass @entity10 for the most wins by a @entity1 player in the open era – it was the 497th victory of his career at the @entity15 in @entity15			1
@entity0 was also a beaten finalist in this year 's @entity16 by world no 1 @entity18 back in january , while after reaching the semi-final in @entity15 last week , @entity0 is now the second highest points scorer on the @entity21 this year			1
@entity0 poses with fans after his practice at the @entity24 in @entity25 @entity0 practices for his first match at the 2015 @entity27 at the @entity24 a look at the ' @entity29 ' confirms this has been a decent start to the year for @entity0 , with him ahead of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , in that order			1
@entity36 – the current captain of the women 's @entity38 team and star of reality television show @entity41 – is convinced @entity0 's back operation in late 2013 severely hampered his performances across the last 12 months			1
and she feels son @entity0 , who is marrying @entity44 on april 11 in @entity45 , is only just starting to move as he did in 2013 when he lifted the @entity47 title and challenged the supremacy of @entity18 as the world 's best player on a near weekly basis			1
@entity0 is put through his paces ahead of the @entity27 @entity0 had a difficult 2014 due to a back injury but is back to his best now according to mum @entity36 ' 2014 was a difficult year for @entity0 because he was returning from back surgery and any kind of surgery you just do n't recover quickly from , ' said @entity5 , speaking at the @entity58 at @entity59 , where she is a mentor for @entity62 's @entity61 programme , which provides vital financial and development support to 100 young athletes from across the @entity1 and @entity65			1
' but i think when it 's in your back it takes a long time to get it to the stage where you can put it through what you need to , to play tennis at the very top level and i think once he got into the back end of the season he finished it very strong			2
' he won three tournaments , he qualified for the end of year finals and finished the year at six in the world , which is an incredible achievement considering he had what he would say was an inconsistent season			0
@entity87 watches @entity0 during practice in @entity25 ' but then he had a really good off season with his coach @entity87 and played incredible tennis all the way through @entity93 and the preparation events			1
' that was a really good sign and it was good to see him back moving well and happy and healthy and playing his best tennis			1
' and i think we saw some of his best tennis again at @entity15 , which was great to see , so i think he 's back on track and he 's happy and he 's healthy			2
' @entity0 is hopeful of adding to his coaching team this week ; with the appointment of former world number four @entity103			2
the @entity105 will join as an assistant to @entity87 sometime after he finishes his involvement in a @entity105 television dance show			0
the arrival of @entity103 to @entity110 is timely after @entity18 dismantled the world @entity111 at @entity15 ; the defeat sparked a @entity115 row with a disgruntled fan and highlighted the urgent improvements needed if the @entity118 is to challenge for @entity120 titles again			0
but mum @entity36 has called on fans to be patient as @entity0 rebuilds his career ; while she is convinced another major title is only just around the corner			1
' i think you have to remember that @entity18 is the best player in the world presently and no match against him is ever going to be easy , ' she added			0
' @entity0 made the semi-finals of the @entity129 last year and has a good game for clay because he is a great athlete and has a great engine on him			2
' growing up , we trained a lot on clay in @entity136			0
he played a lot on hard courts in @entity139 , albeit indoors , so that will always be in my opinion his best surface			0
' the grass season is very short and less of the top players play well on grass because they do n't have grass courts in their country , so they are not used to it			0
' so i think grass always presents itself a big opportunity for any @entity1 player			0
' but i think @entity0 's goal is the same as it was when he was a little boy , he wants to win @entity120 and he wants to be the best			2
' he has a very good record in @entity120 over the last four or five years so he will be out there and doing his best			0
' @entity62 's @entity61 programme partners with @entity157 to provide financial support and training to the sports stars of the future			0
keep up to date with the latest @ @entity162			0

@entity0 is in @entity164 preparing for the @entity27
@entity0 suffered a back injury in 2014 and was not at his best
@entity36 says her son has *nowremoved* and playing his best tennis
