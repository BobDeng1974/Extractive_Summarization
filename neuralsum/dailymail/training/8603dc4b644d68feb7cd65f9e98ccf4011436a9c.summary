a supercar fanatic fed up with missing out on offers of dates from women who spotted him diriving his @entity5 has launched an app that he hopes will be the key to revving up @entity9 's sex lives			1
@entity10 found himself swamped with date requests from attractive women who caught sight of him behind the wheel of his £ 170,000 @entity16			1
women were apparently so desperate to meet him that they contacted a local luxury car dealer to be put in touch with the owner			1
@entity10 ( r ) with @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , who developed the app , was fed up with missing out on offers of dates so created a way of tracking someone down via their car registration fuelled by this new - found female attention and his worry that he was missing out on offers from women who had admired him ( and his car ) from afar but would n't think of contacting a car dealership , the businessman set up @entity36			1
the app which allows admirers to contact any car owner in the country			2
all you do is sign up to the website or app and send a message or a ' wave ' to any registration plate			1
the recipient can only see it if they sign up to the app themselves and when they do , their messages will be waiting for them			0
@entity10 , from @entity54 , @entity55 , said : ' i started getting phone calls from my car dealer , asking if i had been out that day in my @entity5			1
he told me that he 'd had a number of calls from ladies who had spotted me driving my car and wanted to go out for a drink with me			2
supercar heartthrob : @entity10 's car dealer was swamped with date requests from attractive women who spotted @entity10 driving around in his £ 170,000 @entity67 so he looked for a way to help them find him ' and it got me thinking , what were the chances that other people had spotted me but did n't know how to track me down , or did n't think to contact me through my dealer			1
' or what if i had only been in the area on business , and lived elsewhere			0
how would they find me ? ' the odds are stacked against me ever getting those messages or those women ever finding me - so i started to think about how i could make it easier for people to get in touch			2
this is the 21st century , it should n't be that difficult			0
' @entity85 - mad stud ? sign up for free and find love , says @entity10 of his new app light bulb moment : fuelled by his new - found female attention and annoyance of always missing their offers , the entrepreneur set up @entity95 that 's clever ! the app allows admirers to contact any car owner in the country so the 58 - year - old entrepreneur launched the @entity95 website , followed by mobile apps which allow people to connect with potential partners almost instantly			1
@entity10 added : ' every penny people spend on a car , over what they need , is a statement , a way of standing out from the crowd			1
' no one needs a flashy car , but we buy them to attract attention and if it 's a really nice car , then people will stop and take an extra look			0
' people always go for the very best that is available to them - it 's just a fact of life that money attracts people			0
' but if i saw the world 's fittest woman getting into a battered old fiesta , i would hardly care what car she was driving			0
not just for attracting love : @entity10 says there are many other uses for it , such as seeing a dog in distress in a hot car , and you want to text the owner to let them know ' dating sites are renowned for people putting up old pictures , and it can always be a disappointment when you meet someone and they look nothing like that anymore			1
' but if you have just seen someone getting into their car , you know exactly who you are messaging			0
' and despite its obvious benefits as a tool for singletons to track down lovers , @entity10 insists the app can be used for a whole host of reasons			2
he added : ' there are so many uses for it - it can be whatever you want it to be			0
the amazing thing about it is that it gives you a way to connect instantly with someone , you never know who you 're going to see or what car they might be driving			0
the new @entity170 ? @entity171 thinks dating sites are renowned for people putting up old pictures but his app wo n't disappoint , he promises ' but if something interesting happens , then @entity95 gives you a way to get in touch			2
' you might have seen someone driving a car you like , and want to get in touch			0
or imagine it 's a hot summer 's day and you can see a dog in distress in a hot car , and you want to text the owner to let them know			2
' i think it could be a really big thing - the possibilities are endless			0
