drivers on this newly - built highway found themselves on a road to nowhere when they hit an entire farm blocking the route			1
most of the residents of @entity7 , @entity8 , accepted pay packages to move out and allow for construction on the road			1
but farmer @entity11 , 72 , and his wife @entity12 , 71 , felt they were not offered enough - so stayed put			1
now , mr @entity11 's barn and yard - home to a goat and a few chickens - straddles the highway in east @entity8 's @entity28 province , completely blocking any cars from getting past			1
small vehicles can make their way round on a narrow dirt track to the side			2
@entity35 , however , will have to turn back and take a diversion			0
motorists have blasted the construction workers for failing to notify anyone about the obstacle , which does not show up on sat navs			1
stubborn : farmer @entity11 refused to sell up and move on so construction workers simply built either side of him conflict : small vehicles can attempt to slip round the property on a dirt track but lorries will have to turn back @entity47 , 35 , told local media : ' i could n't believe it when i was travelling down the road and it just ended at the farm			1
' on both sides there is a massive construction site and the only way to get past was to use a dirt path which i doubt would be wide enough for a lorry and certainly not for two cars			2
' my navigation system told me it was the best short cut but clearly nobody had told the people that programmed it about the farmhouse			0
' the conflict is one of many across @entity8 as swathes of land are being snapped up by construction firms to build industrial complexes , highways and residential estates			0
nail house : properties like mr @entity11 's are referred to as nail houses because the stand out like a nail in a wall properties like mr @entity11 's are known locally as nail households , because they stand out like a lone nail in a solitary wooden fence post			2
the images that ended up widely shared on @entity8 social media network @entity83 were largely confined to attracting criticism of the local council for rushing the building work through without signing up the land			0
the road was branded effectively pointless until the farmer is removed			0
however the council say that their hands are tied to paying approved rates for land to prevent setting a bad example and encouraging others to hold out for a good price .			0

@entity11 , 72 , and his wife @entity12 , 71 , refused to sell their farm in @entity7
