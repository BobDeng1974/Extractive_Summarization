bacteria from a family that includes potentially deadly infectious bugs may protect against food allergies , research has shown			1
@entity5 encompasses around 100 bacterial species , some of which live harmlessly in the gut			2
others are responsible for gangrene , tetanus , botulism food poisoning and hospital infections caused by @entity15			2
gut bacteria hold the key to beating food allergies , researchers say environmental effects on gut flora - including over-use of antibiotics , high fat diets , excessive hygiene and even infant formula feeding - may be contributing to food allergies by suppressing @entity5 , the researchers believe			1
tests indicated that @entity5 caused immune cells to produce high levels of a signalling molecule known to decrease permeability of the intestinal lining			1
this in turn reduced the chances of allergens - molecules that trigger an allergic reaction - leaking into the bloodstream			0
the team is now working on turning the discovery into a probiotic food allergy treatment , and has filed a provisional patent			1
the new study suggests that ' friendly ' @entity5 have a unique ability to block the harmful immune response behind food allergies			1
tests on ' sterile ' mice sensitised to peanuts showed that introducing a @entity5 cocktail into their bacteria - free guts reversed their allergy			1
re-introduction of another major group of gut bacteria , @entity59 , did not have the same effect			0
tests indicated that @entity5 caused immune cells to produce high levels of a signalling molecule known to decrease permeability of the intestinal lining			2
this in turn reduced the chances of allergens - molecules that trigger an allergic reaction - leaking into the bloodstream			0
@entity70 lead scientist professor @entity69 , from the @entity71 , said : ' we 've identified a bacterial population that protects against food allergen sensitisation			0
' the first step in getting sensitised to a food allergen is for it to get into your blood and be presented to your immune system			2
@entity80 ' he presence of these bacteria regulates that process			0
' environmental effects on gut flora - including over-use of antibiotics , high fat diets , excessive hygiene and even infant formula feeding - may be contributing to food allergies by suppressing @entity5 , the researchers believe			1
their findings appear in the journal @entity95			0
mice used in the study were either raised from birth in sterile conditions or treated with antibiotics as newborns to wipe out most of their gut bacteria			0
both groups were sensitised by exposing them to peanut allergens , triggering a strong immune response			1
they produced significantly higher levels of peanut - targeting antibodies than mice with normal populations of gut bacteria			2
when @entity5 was present , immune cells generated high levels of the protective signalling molecule , interleukin 22 ( @entity115 )			2
but when @entity115 was neutralised , levels of allergen in the animals ' bloodstreams significantly increased			0
the team has already been able to reverse peanut allergies in mice the team is now working on turning the discovery into a probiotic food allergy treatment , and has filed a provisional patent			1
' it 's exciting because we know what the bacteria are ; we have a way to intervene , ' said prof @entity69			0
' there are of course no guarantees , but this is absolutely testable as a therapeutic against a disease for which there 's nothing			0
' as a mom , i can imagine how frightening it must be to worry every time your child takes a bite of food			0
' between 6 % and 8 % of children in the @entity147 are believed to have a diagnosed food allergy			1
since 1990 , the number of annual @entity147 hospital admissions due to food allergy reactions has soared by 500 %			1
severe food allergy can cause anaphylaxis , an extreme immune reaction that may prove fatal			1
common triggers for anaphylaxis include peanuts , tree nuts such as almonds , walnuts and cashews , sesame , fish , shellfish , dairy products and eggs .			0
