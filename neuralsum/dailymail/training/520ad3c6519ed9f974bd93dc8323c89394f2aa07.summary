by @entity0 published : 03:42 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 10:35 est , 15 october 2013 @entity2 creator @entity1 is at the centre of another row after claiming that only those with an ‘ expensive education ’ , like the one he had , are able to understand @entity8 plays			1
he made the comment in response to criticisms by @entity8 scholars over the rewriting of dialogue in his recently released screen version of @entity16 , starring @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
@entity20 , from the @entity21 in @entity23 - home to the world ’s largest collection of @entity8 materials - was sceptical about @entity1 ' approach			1
controversy : @entity1 ( left ) has claimed that only those with an expensive education can properly understand the works of @entity8 ( right ) she told @entity33 : ‘ @entity35 ’ adaptation , while poetic and set in the period of @entity8 ’s play , is not using @entity8 ’s language			1
the advertising has n’t been very clear on this fact			0
’ and professor @entity41 , the director of the @entity43 's @entity42 in @entity44 , told the paper : ‘ i think it is interesting that there is a trend at the moment to replace some of the bits of difficult vocabulary in @entity8 to make it clearer , and that is clearly what @entity1 has done with this script - though some of it sounds a little bit clunky in the trailer			1
’ but @entity1 dismissed the comments , claiming that the language had to be dumbed down , as only those who ’ve attended elite universities are capable of engaging with @entity8 ’s works			1
he told the @entity68 : ‘ to see the original in its absolutely unchanged form , you require a kind of @entity67 scholarship and you need to understand the language and analyse it and so on			0
‘ i can do that because i had a very expensive education , i went to @entity73			1
’ however , @entity77 actress @entity76 told @entity78 that ‘ you do n’t need to have an education to respond to it ’ and that ‘ if talented actors understand what they ’re doing and can communicate that , then that ’s all you need ’			0
professor @entity83 , author of @entity8 , @entity84 , and @entity85 and honorary president of the @entity87 , echoed these thoughts			1
' not all education has to be expensive			0
i know excellent @entity91 who went to comprehensive schools ' - professor @entity83 , president of the @entity87 he told @entity93 : ' not all education has to be expensive - i know excellent @entity91 who went to comprehensive schools			2
' @entity8 's language runs the gamut from passages of considerable intellectual complexity as for instance in some of the speeches of @entity102 to others of sublime simplicity , such as the reunion of @entity106 and @entity107			2
' one of the advantages of seeing and hearing @entity8 well acted is that the actors have done some of the work of comprehension for you , so that the listener may understand the feeling behind the lines without necessarily being able to paraphrase them			2
' but nothing will come of nothing ( as @entity106 says			0
) it 's not unreasonable to hope that people - young or old - should make an effort to educate themselves into a state where they can understand and enjoy some of the greatest works ever written			0
' @entity128 , ceo of @entity129 , which is giving 25,000 students across the @entity131 the chance to perform @entity8 in their local theatre , also disagreed with @entity1 ' assertion , arguing that children from all walks of life are able to enjoy his plays			1
she said : ' when children are given the opportunity to frame @entity8 in their own terms , the magic begins			2
we call it @entity144 – to challenge , support and inspire every child through performing @entity8 ’s work			2
any child , whatever their background , and regardless of any learning , physical or cultural challenge they may be facing , can grasp the @entity8 ’s great words and make them their own			0
' @entity18 and @entity17 star in @entity16 mr @entity1 ’ remarks follow controversy over a rape scene in @entity2 that attracted more than 200 complaints			1
he defended the scene , saying the director had shown restraint in cutting away to other rooms of the house and it could have been much more graphic			0
he told the @entity68 : ' the whole point of the way we do things on @entity2 is we do n't do them gratuitously			0
we are interested in exploring the resultant emotions and the effect these things have on people			0

@entity1 made the remark after criticism of his version of @entity16
the @entity2 creator attended @entity73
one @entity8 scholar said the dialogue in @entity16 was ' clunky '
leading @entity8 scholar @entity83 has taken issue with @entity1
