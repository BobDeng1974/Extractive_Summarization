the new defence secretary @entity0 has accused @entity1 of ‘ sponsoring terrorism ’ and delivered an ultimatum to @entity5 ’s leader : ‘ get out of @entity6			1
’ in the most outspoken response to the crisis from any senior western politician , mr @entity0 said @entity1 must be taught he can not get away with ‘ egging on ’ @entity5 separatists blamed for the attack			1
‘ we have to make it very clear if there is any more interference like this – and it turns out he was behind it – there will be repercussions			2
he has to be clear the @entity21 will act			2
he warned @entity1 : ‘ get out of @entity6 and leave it to the @entity32			1
’ mr @entity0 ’s tough talk was echoed by @entity27 who said last night : ‘ if president @entity1 does not change his approach on @entity6 , then @entity35 and the @entity21 must fundamentally change our approach to @entity5			1
this is not about military action			2
but it is time to make our power , influence and resources count			2
’ mr @entity0 also vowed to stop the crisis caused by the airliner shot down over @entity6 turning into @entity45 , but said he feared the dispute could spill over into other former @entity48 nations which have defied @entity1			1
he ruled out sending @entity50 soldiers to @entity6 to defend it against @entity5 backed attacks			1
but , significantly , he did not rule out other military assistance from @entity50 and its @entity54 allies			2
the @entity55 could provide fighter jets , as it already does to protect another part of the @entity58 , the @entity59 state of @entity60 , targeted by @entity1 , he suggested			1
and the @entity50 government could punish @entity5 billionaires with money held in @entity64			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity66 , mr @entity0 , 62 , said : ‘ i do n’t think we are at the start of @entity45 , but @entity54 has to respond			1
it is clearly a threat to @entity54 ’s @entity72 flank and that ’s why we must offer as much reassurance as we can , particularly to the @entity75 – that is why we have had four ( @entity55 ) @entity77 there since may			2
’ asked about the risk of a major confrontation between @entity5 and the @entity21 , he said : ‘ that is what we are working very hard to avoid			1
’ operation : rescue forces have started retrieve and remove bodies of passengers from the crash site of @entity89 crash site : @entity32 rescue workers have been allowed into the site to start collecting bodies of the victims members of the @entity96 worked late into the night retrieving bodies in body bags he said it was ‘ extremely worrying ’ that the @entity6 flashpoint ‘ could spill over elsewhere to @entity101 and states in the @entity103			0
’ but he dismissed claims there was little the @entity50 could do to stop @entity1			1
‘ if @entity5 is the principal culprit , we can take further action against them and make it clear this kind of sponsored war is completely unacceptable			1
it is sponsored terrorism as far as people of @entity6 are concerned			2
we do n’t know if somebody said “ let ’s bring down a civil airliner , wherever it ’s from , ” – but we need to find out			0
’ asked if @entity1 was ‘ egging on ’ @entity5 separatists , mr @entity0 replied : ‘ yes			1
that is the danger that flows from @entity5 activity on and over the border in the last few months			1
that ’s why he needs to move his troops away from the border and stop interfering			0
‘ they need to get out of @entity6 and leave @entity6 to the @entity32			0
’ asked about claims that the crisis in @entity6 was the result of an attempt by @entity1 to rebuild the former @entity135 empire of the @entity48 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ there ’s a pattern emerging			1
we saw what he did in @entity141 , we ’ve seen now what he ’s done in @entity144 and we need to respond to that			0
' we need to leave @entity6 to the @entity32			0
@entity1 needs to move his troops from the border and stop interfering ' ‘ there ’s no prospect of us putting boots on the ground in @entity6 , though we can assist with technology , surveillance and technical support			1
’ but could any @entity50 military firepower be involved ? ‘ we have contributed to the @entity59 air policing mission by putting @entity77 into @entity60 , and we will certainly do what ’s needed for any of our @entity54 allies in providing reassurance and support			0
’ and what if @entity6 asked for military help from the @entity50 ? ‘ that ’s for @entity54 to respond to – i wo n’t be drawn , ’ he said cautiously , in an interview at the @entity164 on friday			0
pressed on whether he would rule it out , mr @entity0 said : ‘ we ’ve not been asked to put troops on the ground in @entity6 so it ’s speculation at the moment			1
’ however , he added the @entity54 summit in september ‘ will have to think how it offers more reassurance to countries on its borders , ’ laying emphasis on the ‘ will			0
’ so ultimately , it must be some kind of military assistance ? ‘ yes , but military assistance takes many forms : defence capacity building , technical support , sharing assets			0
’ as for whether there were any circumstances in which @entity50 would defend @entity6 from a @entity5 attack , he went on : ‘ i ’m not going to speculate			1
we are facing a different type of warfare , ambiguous warfare where countries like @entity5 appear to be acting through sponsored groups , vehicles without marking , uniforms without tabs			1
we need to work out a response to that			0
’ and what would he say to @entity1 if he could speak to him face to face ? ‘ i would say “ it is completely unacceptable for a country to be involved in this kind of activity in another sovereign state			1
” ‘ there is plenty of evidence that financial sanctions are already affecting the @entity5 economy and the ability of their bodies to trade through @entity64			1
there ’s a range of other sanctions available , cutting off more links with @entity5			2
he [ @entity1 ] needs to trade with the @entity21 and relies on the @entity216			2
’ unlike his predecessor , super- cautious @entity219 , surgeon ’s son mr @entity0 is known to speak his mind			2
@entity221 has supported claims @entity224 separatists were behind the missile that hit @entity226 married with two children , he first became an mp in 1983			2
his 21 year ‘ journey ’ to reach the @entity229 in his 60s flies in the face of claims that the reshuffle was designed to clear out ‘ male , pale and stale ’ @entity236 from the prime minister ’s top table			0
clearly , @entity27 does not regard @entity239 as stale – or he would n’t have put him in the defence hot seat , with his finger on @entity50 ’s nuclear button			0
and as for whether he has he seen nuclear button ... ‘ i ’ve been briefed on the procedures , ’ he mutters with an irritated sigh			0
@entity239 ’s world - weary , some would say cynical , manner , has led some to mistrust him			0
he was in @entity251 exile when @entity27 first became leader in 2005 , having strongly backed rival candidate @entity253			0
but his shrewd , hard - headed approach , combined with proving his loyalty in the nine intervening years , persuaded a sceptical @entity27 to give him another chance			0
@entity239 is no one dimensional career politician			0
in a five year spell out of @entity258 in the 1990s , he went into business with @entity260 , of tv ’s ‘ @entity261 ’ he has a long standing interest in defence , but no military background			0
nor is it clear if he has ever fired a gun			0
after a long pause , he replied : ‘ not since school			0
’ in the @entity271 , i suggest ? ‘ yes , probably , ’ was his less than emphatic reply .			0

@entity0 accuses @entity1 of ' sponsoring terrorism '
warned there is a danger of @entity5 president ' egging on ' separatists
' there will be repercussions ' if it emerges @entity1 was behind jet hit , he says
