father and the bride : @entity16 arrives at the church to be wed @entity14 aristocrats @entity15 and @entity16 married at their local church , wrapping up against the chill in tartan happily married : @entity126 leaving the ceremony with her husband the church where @entity14 aristocrats @entity15 and @entity16 married the couple were played into the ceremony by traditional @entity14 bagpipe players while the weather has taken a turn for the better , miss @entity6 was clearly not taking any chances with the warm but elegant outfit the columnist was all smiles as she left the church with her friend have n't we seen that before : @entity6 pictured in purple but wearing the fur stole ( left ) and right wearing the same piece last year another weekend , another society wedding for the @entity147 ’s little sister			1
here @entity1 ’s @entity148 analyses @entity6 ’s latest look : in this sexy , glamorous , yet totally appropriate outfit , @entity6 gives us a masterclass on how to dress for a winter wedding			2
( yes , we know it ’s supposed to be spring , it ’s just that @entity17 , where her friends @entity15 and @entity16 tied the knot on saturday , obviously had n’t got the memo )			1
i do n’t think i ’ve seen her look this stylish since @entity147 and @entity160 ’s big day			0
the sleek lines and split of her £ 578 floor - length , silk @entity164 flatter her toned legs – and that derrière – while the fluffy tippet adds drama and keeps out the chill			0
sloanes seem to wed at a rate of knots , so it ’s no wonder @entity6 recycled the stole , which she wore to another winter wedding , in december 2012			2
opinion is divided as to whether it ’s real or fake fox , but if it is faux , it ’s extremely convincing			0
fur has been all over the catwalk recently , so @entity6 ’s obviously been paying attention			0
the jaunty @entity183 cocktail hat is a winner too			0
i love the elegant feather , which is much more stylish than the overblown silk flowers she ’s favoured in the past			0
the purple dress makes her olive complexion glow , although it could be argued that the matching bangle , clutch bag and suede @entity193 court shoes are overkill			0
she looks sexy , radiant and grown - up – yet not old beyond her years , which is a fashion trap she ’s fallen into in the past			0
she and her mother , @entity198 , have often been snapped in very similar outfits , which look great on @entity200 , but can make 29 - year - old @entity6 look rather too sloaney and staid			0
no chance of that in this foxy ensemble .			0
