it 's one of the biggest dates on the party calendar and one of the few which sees fashion heavy - hitters such as @entity9 and sir @entity10 hobnob with the a-list and models alike			1
with so many style setters in one room , competition for the title of best dressed is fierce with party - goers pulling out all the stops to ensure they make headlines for all the right reasons			1
but not everyone gets their look spot on			0
from the highs ( @entity27 's glorious red skirt ) to the lows ( @entity29 and @entity30 ) , @entity24 reveals which @entity32 guests deserve a sartorial round of applause - and those who need to go back to style school			1
' @entity27 looked gorgeous , ' says fashion expert @entity55			1
' i always love red on a red carpet , and this mermaid skirt looked great on her			2
she 's not the biggest star here , and she knows it , hence , she did n't try and compete with a gown			0
' others to come top of the class included @entity46 , who , as usual , offered a masterclass in low - key red carpet dressing and the night 's big winner , @entity68			1
' @entity46 looked every inch the young starlet , ' comments @entity55			1
' she loves to work the masculine look , and this is a masterclass at how to do it but still remain girly and current			0
' this is actually a wide - leg jumpsuit , and the addition of the oversized @entity76 blazer is just perfect for her			1
' equally gorgeous were the two @entity79 sisters , @entity80 and @entity81 , who both chose sequins in simple black and shimmering gold			2
models @entity84 and @entity86 also pulled off glamorous gowns - leaving @entity55 impressed			1
style sisters : both @entity79 sisters know a thing or two about fashion and , as usual , looked immaculate on the red carpet pretty dramatic : @entity93 picked a figure - flattering prom shape in on - trend snake print while @entity96 opted for a signature boho dress long lines : @entity100 and @entity68 can always be relied on to get it right and they did n't disappoint at the @entity32 's ' leave it to the super models to show everyone how it 's done , ' he says			1
' @entity84 has everything to smile about in her gorgeous , sexy gown			0
it 's like liquid silver has been poured and draped all over her			0
' @entity86 is equal parts drama and romance in @entity114			2
i love how she always embraces her height and with the bold red lip , she looked devastatingly good			2
' and @entity86 and @entity84 were n't the only models to give the actresses a run for their money			2
perennial fashion favourite @entity96 proved that while she might be 40 , she 's certainly not over the hill when it comes to fashion			1
' leave it to @entity96 to parade around in something fun , flirty and retro , ' says @entity55			2
' her @entity130 bat - wing mini dress was a welcome relief from to all the long , floor - length gowns too			0
big hair on @entity96 is brilliant			2
' short and sweet : proving that red carpet does n't have to mean floor - length are @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 @entity140 glamour : @entity141 @entity84 and model @entity86 wowed fans in sweeping floor - length dresses looking good : model @entity145 was gorgeous in a fabulous floor - length pink gown while the ever - dapper @entity148 sharpened up in a suit impressively pulled together though @entity96 and the model posse were , not all of them got it right , among them @entity154 , whose dress was one of two halves - both ill - fitting			1
' i love @entity154 , but this is not ok , ' says @entity55			0
' it does n't scream supermodel - more @entity161 on a bad day			0
the bottom half is creased , and for me , there 's no excuse for that , especially early in the evening			0
' she should always stick to @entity168 for events like this			0
@entity171 would have done her proud			0
' @entity172 , usually a classic dresser , attempted to inject a shot of sex appeal via a long , sheer skirt but ended up looking a little frumpy as a result of her @entity180 style underwear			2
but while @entity172 and @entity154 failed to set the red carpet alight , @entity29 and @entity30 did , although for all the wrong reasons			1
' where to start with @entity29 ? ' says a horrified @entity55			2
' well , actually , from the beginning : whose idea was it to match your eye shadow with the dress and with the shoes ? good @entity192 , it looks awful			0
but that 's @entity29 's thing , ugly clothes work for her			1
' must try harder @entity196 : @entity29 needed a bra to make her pink dress work , while @entity30 would have looked better if she had found an outfit to wear step down ! the skirt was nice but @entity202 's sparkly crop top was more school disco than awards show - as were her awful platform shoes try harder : @entity206 was swamped by her dress while sandals would have improved @entity210 's dress			1
@entity211 looked like a bride @entity29 , at least , did bother to wear some clothes , unlike @entity30 who opted for an ill - fitting oversized tuxedo jacket and very little else			1
despite a huge diamond necklace , all eyes were on the huge tattoo on her breastbone , while the opaque black tights seemed strange given all the flesh being flashed elsewhere			0
' at first glance , i loved @entity30 's @entity223 get up , but the more i look the more i hate it , ' says @entity55			1
' and i can not abide tights , especially dark tights , with sandals			0
' equally dreadful was @entity202 , who managed to ruin her pretty black skirt by adding a crop top and pair of platforms that looked as if they had been hired for a school disco			1
others opting for fancy dress included @entity211 , who appeared to have come as a bride , and @entity237 who was channeling the regency period in a flowing silk and lace gown that came in a jarring shade of pistachio			0
' who told @entity237 this was a good look ? it 's frumpy and completely the wrong shape for her , ' insists @entity55			0
' leave this kind of thing for @entity252 contestants			0
' too much : pretty print , pretty ruffle , pretty neckline - but too much together @entity257			0
singer @entity258 had a similar problem oh dear : @entity154 's frock was a dress of two halves - both ill - fitting - while @entity172 's dress erred on the frumpy side not so clever colour : @entity267 and @entity237 both suffered from bad colour and poor fit , while @entity270 was crumpled in blue			1

@entity27 looked wonderful in her white skirt while @entity42 shone in delicate blue
also looking good were @entity68 , @entity96 and @entity46 , as well as @entity86
@entity30 chose to opt out of wearing ( most ) clothes and turned up in an ill - fitting , oversized blazer
equally dreadful was @entity29 , who needed a bra , and @entity202 's school disco style ensemble
