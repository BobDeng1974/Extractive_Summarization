for the first time , @entity2 's racial and ethnic minorities now make up about half of the under - 5 age group and will be a majority by this year or next			1
that 's according to new census numbers that show a faster shift than expected toward a minority - majority , one where whites will be in the minority by 2043			1
the new estimates also show that , for the fist time in more than a century , the death rate for white @entity15 outnumbers the birth rate			1
slow shift : children under 5 in @entity2 will soon be over 50 percent non-white			1
by 2043 , white americans will be in the minority the @entity22 reported earlier this year that non-white babies now outnumber white babies			1
fueled by immigration and high rates of birth , particularly among @entity28 , racial and ethnic minorities are now growing more rapidly in numbers than whites			1
based on current rates of growth , whites in the under - 5 group are expected to tip to a minority this year or next , @entity33 , the @entity22 's acting director , said			1
the government also projects that in five years , minorities will make up more than half of children under 18			1
not long after , the total @entity2 white population will begin an inexorable decline in absolute numbers , due to aging baby boomers			1
new census numbers indicate that white @entity15 are shifting towards a statistical minority			1
last year 's numbers indicated that white babies are now a minority			1
now the under age 5 group will soon be made up of over half racial minorities			1
as of 2012 , 49.9 % of children 5 and under were racial minorities			1
by this year or next , the number will be over 50 %			0
the number of deaths now exceeds the number of births in the white @entity2 population for the first time in a century			1
the non-white population as a whole has increased to 37 percent of @entity2			2
fastest growth is among @entity15 who consider themselves multi-racial non-hispanic whites currently make up 63 percent of the @entity2 non-hispanic whites remain the majority in @entity2 , but last year saw more deaths in the demographic than births			1
there were the actual number of non-hispanic whites in @entity2 actually went up , however , due to 188,000 white immigrants to the @entity2 from countries like @entity76 and @entity77			1
according to the @entity81 , the sharp decrease in births versus deaths was a surprise to analysts , who now project the phenomenon to occur regularly starting in the year 2025			2
one contributing factor to the shift is age			0
whites are generally older than other races			2
the median age for a non-hispanic white is 42			2
for @entity93 , it is 34 , it 's under 32 for @entity15 and @entity28 @entity15 have a median age of under 28			2
female fertility rates have dropped considerably in white women since the start of the recession in 2007			0
in that group , fertility rates are now below levels necessary to maintain their population			0
demographer @entity105 from the @entity106 told the @entity81 that non-hispanic whites are still choosing not to have children , despite a better economy			0
and that will be exacerbated once the baby boom generation begins to die off			0
' once this recession has waned , we ’re probably going to see at least a temporary uptick in births until death rates start to rise , ' he said			0
the @entity22 reports that the number of whites will peak following resumed baby - making from an improved economy at around 2024 when the oldest of the baby boomers will be approaching 80 years old			2
surprise stats : some of the changes to the @entity2 population in 2012 were unexpected			2
there was a negative ' natural ' population change of 12,400 , meaning over ten thousand more white @entity15 died last year than were born the imminent tip to a white minority among young children adds a racial dimension to government spending on early - childhood education , such as president @entity137 's proposal to significantly expand pre-kindergarten for lower - income families			1
the nation 's demographic changes are already stirring discussion as to whether some civil rights - era programs , such as affirmative action in college admissions , should be retooled to focus more on income rather than race and ethnicity			0
the @entity149 will rule on the issue this month			0
studies show that gaps in achievement by both race and class begin long before college , suggesting that @entity2 remedies to foster equal opportunity will need to reach earlier into a child 's life			1
‘ the educational system is likely to be the most widely used and most acceptable policy tool we have for equalizing life chances			0
but it does not seem so far to achieve this goal , ’ said @entity161 , an economics professor at the @entity162 who specializes in income inequality			0
‘ this specter of unequal opportunity may be the biggest negative social outcome of the continuing @entity2 inequality boom			2
’ the gap between rich and poor in the @entity2 has now stretched to its widest since 1970 , making opportunities to reach the middle class increasingly difficult			2
longer - term changes in family structure , such as a decline in marriage , have led to a rise in single - mother households across all racial groups , with the fastest growth now occurring among whites			2
more than 40 percent of newborns are now born out of wedlock , in families more likely to be low income			0
all in the numbers : the rate of death , too , now exceeds the rate of births for @entity2 whites and racial minority babies already outnumber white babies ‘ more so than ever , we need to recognize the importance of young minorities for the growth and vitality of our labor force and economy , ’ said @entity198 , a demographer at the @entity199 who analyzed the census data			1
@entity209 's analysis of the latest research and data on social mobility , provided to @entity213 , shows that a child 's achievement varies widely depending on a parent 's education and income			0
the reason : more educated parents tend to have fewer children and generally earn more money than before , allowing them to spend larger amounts of time or money on a child 's development , including music or art classes , extra tutoring , or travel and summer camps			2
the gaps in achievement tend to emerge early in childhood , continuing through high school , and disparities are especially evident in @entity239 admission scores			0
@entity241 data show that average scores spread as wide as 130 - 140 points in each of the reading , math and writing sections for a student with family income of less than $ 20,000 , compared with a student with family income exceeding $ 200,000			0
about 40 percent of whites age 25 - 29 graduate from college , compared with 15 percent for @entity254 and 23 percent for blacks			0
multiple factors : just as more children are being born to racial minorities than to whites , the white death rate is now higher than the birth rate for the first time in a century @entity137 proposed expanding @entity264 education for any 4 - year - old whose family income was below twice the federal poverty rate , or $ 46,000 for a family of four			1
that is an increasingly minority age group that would benefit from what @entity137 calls the single most effective way to boost educational outcomes			0
the plan would be paid for by a nearly $ 1 per pack federal cigarette tax			0
but at a time of strapped federal budgets , @entity277 lawmakers have been reluctant to expand the scope of government or raise new taxes			0
@entity284 and @entity285 costs due to aging of the mostly white baby boomer generation are also adding to the government burden			0
a recent @entity290 study found that state funding for pre-k programs had its largest drop ever last year , with states now spending less per child than a decade ago .			0

@entity22 numbers show that racial minorities will make up over half of kids under 5
whites to be the minority by 2043
for the first time in a century , deaths outnumber births in @entity2 's white population
