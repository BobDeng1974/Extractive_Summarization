@entity0 has a habit of delivering when you least expect it			1
while at @entity6 the little spaniard with the big heart turned up at the office of a @entity9 supporter to deliver him his new club shirt , and had to persuade the receptionist to let him in			1
earlier this year , at a @entity12 in the impoverished @entity14 area of @entity15 , he stunned schoolchildren by arriving unannounced armed with dozens of toys			0
@entity0 celebrates after scoring a double against @entity20 at @entity21 , when @entity22 needed him @entity0 's second goal in particular was superb , and showed why @entity22 spent so much money on him the little @entity4 put @entity22 ahead in the first half with a tidy finish following an @entity28 pass but @entity22 fans have had to wait until now , 14 months after @entity29 paid @entity9 Â£ 37m for his services , for him to deliver on the pitch			1
why has it taken so long ? there is mitigation			0
@entity0 's joyous arrival coincided with the miserable final throes of @entity29 regime			1
when the ship is sinking it is hard to dance the tango in the ballroom			0
then came @entity43 and a rigid pragmatism the playmaker presumably thought he had escaped when he said farewell to @entity47			0
a free spirit , @entity0 has not been the only one at @entity49 to take time to digest the platter the @entity53 demands			2
@entity54 was quick to take praise following what feels like a seismic 2 - 1 win in @entity20 , proudly stating that he had now found a position for a man who will never be anything other than a number 10 in a number eight shirt			2
@entity0 is beginning to repay the faith shown by @entity22 's fans , who have stuck by him @entity43 claimed a tactical masterstroke , but he was really only playing @entity0 in his obvious position when he arrived at @entity68 , @entity0 was trying to bring momentum to a losing team the playmaker was allowed to leave @entity9 because @entity47 did n't rate his defensive contributions but a look at @entity54 's record would suggest that , given time , he gets it right			1
now the same can be said of @entity0 , although 14 goals in his last 32 appearances would suggest not much was wrong with the 26 - year - old in the first place			2
the statistics show that his talents have ever been in doubt			0
since his arrival at @entity9 in 2011 , no midfielder has a better joint total of goals and assists in the @entity88			1
@entity0 has 65 ( 31 goals and 34 assists ) , ahead of compatriot @entity91 who has 61 ( 26 and 35 ) for @entity22 's cross-town rivals despite having played a season more in @entity95			1
@entity98 in the 3 - 0 romp over @entity97 , @entity0 was at it again at @entity21			1
his first was provided by another new arrival with a point to prove			0
@entity28 , much to the annoyance of many of the @entity106 faithful , has been absent for long periods of the season			0
@entity0 has been excellent in recent weeks , dominating against @entity97 before scoring twice on sunday the @entity4 watches his wonderful volley fly into the top corner , as he announced his arrival at @entity21 the man from the @entity114 country has basked in the limelight of the first team and his defence - splitting pass for @entity0 illustrated what @entity22 have been missing			1
@entity0 , showing a surprising turn of pace , finished clinically into the bottom corner - but the moment @entity22 fans will forever remember came when he contorted his tiny frame to rifle a @entity126 scissor - volley from @entity128 's pass past a helpless @entity129			1
forget the helicopter landing at @entity131 , @entity0 had finally arrived			2
in the away end there was delirium			0
scoring any kind of goal against the old enemy can provoke that kind of response from the most sober of @entity22 fan			2
in the commentary box there wee gasps			0
@entity144 , a man who knows all about the sublime , hailed the strike as ridiculous			0
many will not have seen it coming but plenty of those who did needed no reminder of his talents			0
in a @entity154 's close to the @entity155 , where @entity9 were playing @entity156 , there were groans from visiting supporters watching on television as @entity0 volleyed in @entity22 's second			1
those supping cut - price ale in the admiral of the @entity163 will no doubt know all about the importance of good deals but many watching events unfold from the other end of the @entity168 voiced their opinion that @entity47 was wrong to let the playmaker go , despite the hefty fee the dainty man delivered			0
since arriving in @entity95 , @entity0 has more goals and assists combined than any other @entity88 player @entity176 star @entity91 is behind @entity0 statistically , despite having been in the league a year longer @entity9 fans were upset to lose their creative spark , and could now do with some of his quality in midfield some think that @entity0 's old club , despite running away with the @entity88 , lack creativity in his absence and can only dream of a world in which he creates chances for @entity189			1
they bemoan their @entity192 manager 's insistence of only selecting prototypes , those who will race back and do their part in the @entity47 masterplan to stifle the opposition			0
their loss , it would finally appear , looks set to be @entity22 's gain .			2

@entity0 excellent in last two games against @entity97 and @entity20
the @entity206 playmaker *struggled* after being bought by @entity29
but since he has been given more freedom he has improved *dramatically*
@entity9 fans now *rue* letting such a creative player leave @entity6
no midfielder has a better joint total of goals and assists in the league
