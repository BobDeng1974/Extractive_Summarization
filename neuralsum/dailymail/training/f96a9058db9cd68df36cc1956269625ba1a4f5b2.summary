by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 09:24 est , 15 may 2012 complimentary : labour leader @entity1 was quick to take advantage of frosty relations between @entity4 and the @entity5 labour leader @entity1 called on @entity7 staff and patients today to hold the government to account for difficulties resulting from its controversial reforms to the health service			1
in a speech to the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) conference in @entity16 , mr @entity1 launched a @entity18 initiative called @entity19 which will allow people to report online on problems faced by hospitals , clinics and family doctors arising from health secretary @entity4 's shake - up			1
seeking to capitalise on the coalition 's fraught relations with @entity7 workers , mr @entity1 hailed nurses as the ' the defenders of the health service ' against market - oriented reforms which he said would divert resources from the front line and lead to disruption , fragmentation and longer waits for treatment			1
after mr @entity4 was heckled and jeered by the @entity5 conference yesterday , mr @entity1 accused ministers of refusing to listen to legitimate concerns			1
despite the reservations expressed by nurses to the @entity7 shake - up , the @entity9 had " ploughed on regardless "			1
mr @entity1 urged @entity7 health and wellbeing boards - which will have strategic oversight of local commissioning - to resist new charges for treatment and ensure patients come before profits			1
' the government have been acting like they are the masters , not the servants , of the @entity7			1
they are not the masters			0
not any government , ' he said			0
' it 's owned by the people of @entity62			0
our health service is owned by patients , professionals and the people			2
and their voice - your voice - deserves to be heard			0
under pressure : mr @entity4 faced a frosty reception at the @entity5 conference yesterday , although he was n't booed ' i ca n't promise that we will always agree about everything			2
but what i will never do is what this government did : dismiss you as just a ' vested interest '			0
you were not a vested interest			0
you were the defenders of the health service			2
' mr @entity1 described nurses as the ' backbone of the @entity7 ' and said he wants to " forge a partnership " with the @entity5 to address the long - term challenges facing the @entity7			1
mr @entity1 's speech comes after mr @entity4 received a rough reception from the @entity5 yesterday			0
he was laughed at by members of the audience after saying nurses should tell superiors if staffing levels were not safe			2
some in the crowd shouted " liar " after the health secretary claimed clinical staffing levels had increased on his watch			1
i 'm listening : mr @entity1 speaks to nurses after his speech heated exchange : delegates cheer another delegate questioning the health secretary yesterday @entity108 's official spokesman said the prime minister had full confidence in mr @entity4			1
the spokesman said : ' whenever you are trying to reform a bit of the public sector and make changes , you should expect some opposition to that			0
' but we think it is important to reform the @entity7			1
although we are protecting the @entity7 budget , an ageing population and increasing costs of treatments mean that we need to reform the health service			1
' we want to work with healthcare professionals as we do that			0
' over the past two years the @entity5 has repeatedly issued dire warnings that thousands of nursing posts are facing the axe			2
ministers have always denied these claims , consistently stating they ‘ do not recognise ’ the @entity5 ’s figures			0
yesterday the union issued yet another report with figures showing that since march 2010 , two months before the @entity139 was formed , a total of 3,588 nursing and midwifery posts have gone			2
again , the government denied these claims and said initially said that there were actually only 450 fewer nursing posts			2
they pointed out that the overall number of clinical roles – which include doctors , scientists , radiologists as well as nurses – had increased			0
but the @entity7 ’s own figures show that the @entity5 are right – there were 311,787 nursing posts in march 2010 compared with just 308,199 now			1
and yesterday for the first time health secretary @entity4 conceded that the @entity7 had lost ‘ about ’ 3,500 nurses			1
the government are correct to state that the clinical posts have gone up , though – there are 3,556 more compared with two years ago			0
many of these include scientists , radiologists who carry out x-rays and sonographers who perform ultrasounds , as well as doctors			0
while the @entity5 acknowledge these roles are valuable , they say that trying to save money by cutting nursing posts is ‘ unintelligent ’ – and will inevitably harm patient care .			0
