' i pulled out on the tuesday before the @entity17 game with the symptoms , and i could maybe have tried to carry on with training , but being aware of the symptoms was important			0
' so just knowing the dangers of the long and short - term dangers , how important it is to be honest and how serious it can be , i think those are the main things i took from the online courses			0
' after the @entity24 game i had a headache and could ( have ) easily thought " it 's @entity8 , it 's @entity9 and i 'll give it a go " , but we 're so clued up on it now that i do n't think anyone would risk it			1
@entity0 ( right ) says he suffered a headache after playing in @entity4 's clash against @entity24 last month ' if i can do it , pulling out of @entity4 - @entity17 , the biggest game of the @entity63 at that point , then i think anyone can do it , and should do it			1
