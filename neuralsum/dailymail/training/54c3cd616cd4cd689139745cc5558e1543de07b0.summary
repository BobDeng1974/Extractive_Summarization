by @entity1 reporter published : 11:10 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 15:00 est , 19 september 2012 a coroner accused staff at a top @entity5 hospital of ‘ gross failure ’ today , following the death of a three - year - old girl in a paediatrics intensive care unit			1
@entity10 was admitted to @entity11 in south @entity5 in june 2011 to undergo surgery to repair her trachea , but died five days later from brain damage caused by hypotension after days of low blood pressure which medics failed to spot			1
@entity19 coroner dr @entity18 today said @entity10 ’s death was ‘ avoidable ’ and that staff in the paediatric intensive care unit ( @entity23 ) failed to give @entity10 ‘ basic medical care ’ that would have brought her low blood pressure under control and saved her life			1
@entity10 was born six weeks premature and had repeatedly contracted chest infections because of problems with her lungs delivering a narrative verdict dr @entity18 said : ‘ the blood pressure was unacceptably low			1
maintenance of blood pressure , in my view , is basic medical care wherever you are			1
‘ it was a gross failure on the part of the @entity23 staff not to do something effective to manage it			0
it was unacceptably low for hour after hour on june 25 and 26			1
they should have appreciated that it was low , their lack of appreciation in my view is a gross failure			0
’ @entity10 's parents paid tribute to their daughter			1
they said : ' she absolutely loved life ' she added : ‘ i have found that the test of neglect has in this narrow area on behalf of paediatric intensive care unit staff has been met			0
’ expert witness dr @entity56 , a consultant in paediatric intensive care at @entity5 ’s @entity58 , said @entity10 ’s doctors had been ‘ blinkered ’ into accepting low blood pressure because of her complex medical history			1
he said : ‘ the complexity of this patient almost blinkered the response in terms of accepting the low numbers of blood pressure			1
it is a basic failure of medical care			0
‘ this patient had a blood pressure of 40 for days and that is unusual			1
i ’ve never in my life seen anyone with a blood pressure so low for so long in my 14 years as a consultant			1
you can treat it so easily			0
’ @entity10 , from @entity77 in west @entity5 , was born six weeks premature and had repeatedly contracted chest infections because of problems with her lungs			2
she was admitted to the hospital on june 23 for elective surgery on her airways			2
but she was the victim of a catalogue of errors which began when doctors inserted a breathing tube into her mouth rather than her nose causing problems when she was sedated			2
the tube was later moved to the wrong part of her lung when vital information about her medical history was not handed over to new doctors taking over her care , @entity91 heard			0
dr @entity99 , a consultant paediatric anaesthetist in intensive care , said other doctors at the hospital had ‘ failed ’ to tell her not to move @entity10 ’s breathing tube during the shift hand - over			1
she said : ‘ i think anything about an airway that has n’t been handed over would have been a serious failure			0
it is not an ordinary failure , it is more than an ordinary failure			0
@entity112 and door it should have been handed over			0
’ echoing this concern , dr @entity18 said : ‘ the failure of the anaesthetist to specifically hand over to picu the reason why the et tube inserted at 14cm there was a gross failure in care and this was a failure in basic medical care			0
it is something that was critical			0
’ dr @entity18 also found that antibiotics should have been given to @entity10 earlier , and again branded the omission a ‘ really serious failure ’ given @entity10 ’s propensity to contracting chest infections			2
@entity10 was due to undergo surgery to repair her trachea , but died five days later from brain damage robust new procedures to change the way patients like @entity140 s are treated have been put in place at @entity11 ¿ s , the court heard after three days in hospital @entity10 ’s condition deteriorated rapidly on june 26 , her blood pressure could barely be detected and she had to be resuscitated			1
a ct scan taken the following morning showed severe brain injuries which ‘ shocked ’ doctors treating the patient			0
@entity10 died at 2.30pm the next day , on june 28			2
@entity10 ’s parents @entity150 and @entity152 , who broke down in tears as they heard the verdict read out , paid tribute to their ‘ energetic little girl ’ in a statement read out in court			1
they said : ‘ @entity10 was a very energetic little girl , she absolutely loved life			2
‘ she had dropped all daytime naps and there was no sign of any problems other than stated and her chest infections was something the surgery was hopefully going to help			0
’ robust new procedures to change the way patients such as @entity10 are treated have been put in place at @entity11 ’s , the court heard			2
dr @entity173 , a consultant clinical geneticist at @entity11 ’s who oversaw the changes , said today that medics have to discuss the positioning of a patient ’s tube if there is a possibility they will go into intensive care , and that the level of sedation has been reduced			0
she said : ‘ i feel happy that the process is now robust			0

doctors failed to hand over properly between teams caring for the little girl
