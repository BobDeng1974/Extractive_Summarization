however , this frustrating pitfall of modern life is set to become a thing of the past as work has begun on the next generation of reversible usb connectors – making it possible to insert a plug into a socket both ways up			0
the new usb type - c connector is being designed to be used in thinner and sleeker products like tablets and ultrabooks			1
inserting a usb plug ( pictured ) into a port the right way up can be annoying but work has begun on a new generation of usb connector called the @entity29 that will be reversible the design has not yet been revealed but its plug will be approximately the same size as a @entity34 plug			2
the idea is that the @entity29 ‘ is the only connector one will need across all devices ’ according to the @entity38			2
crucially , as the new design is different to the current and old usb plugs , users of older computing equipment will need an adapter to use new devices or @entity29 plugs			1
@entity46 , chairman of the group , said the plug is being developed ‘ to help enable thinner and sleeker product designs , enhance usability and provide a growth path for performance enhancements for future versions of usb			0
’ the @entity55 is built on existing @entity54 and usb 2.0 technologies and will be reversible like @entity60 ’s @entity59 connector			1
jabbing at computer ports , when trying to insert usb cables that are almost always the wrong way up , can be very annoying			0
but this activity could become a thing of the past as the next - generation usb connector will be reversible , like @entity60 's @entity59 connector the design is expected to be finalised by the middle of 2014			1
@entity70 of @entity71 said the company ‘ is excited to see the development of the new thin @entity55 as it will enable an entirely new super thin class of devices from phones to tablets , to 2 - in - 1s , to laptops to desktops and a multitude of other more specific usage devices			0
’ ‘ this new industry standards - based thin connector delivering data , power and video is the only connector one will need across all devices , ’ he added .			0

the new usb type - c connector is currently being designed to be used in thinner and sleeker products such as tablets and ultrabooks
it will be fully reversible like @entity60 's @entity59 connector
users of older computing equipment will need an adapter to use @entity29 plugs , the design of which will be finalised in the middle of 2014
