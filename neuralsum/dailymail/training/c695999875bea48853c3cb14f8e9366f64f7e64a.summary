@entity1 's @entity0 are top of the @entity2 and unbeaten entering sunday 's clash with @entity4 , but the @entity6 boss does not expect the feats of @entity9 's ' @entity8 ' to be emulated			1
the @entity10 negotiated the 2003 - 04 @entity2 season without defeat , an achievement previously only performed by @entity14 in the 1880s			1
just like @entity0 's one - in - a - generation 6 - 0 defeat of the @entity10 in march - in @entity9 's 1,000th game in charge - @entity1 believes it is not something which will happen in the modern @entity2 era			1
@entity4 won the @entity2 in 2003 - 04 without losing a single game , it was the last time they won it ' it 's something that happened once in a lifetime , ' @entity1 said			1
' i do n't see , in modern football with the competitiveness of this @entity2 , one team being champion without a defeat			1
' that will stay in the history as the second and the last time			0
' ( that is ) my opinion , but we do n't know			2
' @entity0 have won five and drawn one of their six @entity2 games so far this season and face a @entity10 side also unbeaten			1
@entity1 said the it was a ' once in a lifetime ' achievement and did not think @entity0 would emulate it @entity4 capitulated on their last visit to @entity47 , a match remembered for the gaping defensive holes as well as referee @entity51 's mistake in sending off @entity52 for a handball committed by @entity54			1
@entity1 anticipates a much sterner test of his side , which features former @entity4 captain @entity57 pulling the strings in midfield			1
@entity57 was a precocious teenager when @entity4 won the 2004 title			1
' they will always be a difficult opponent , ' the @entity6 boss added			0
@entity1 loves the intensity of a derby day and testing himself against the best			2
last time the two sides met @entity51 sent of @entity52 after a handball by @entity54 his players will also need no additional motivation , just a few instructions			0
' i like it difficult , ' he said			0
' i like to play against the best			0
my players also like it			0
' sometimes we are worried about the focus and we are worried about the approach			0
' when you play big matches you know the players are more than ready for that			0
' i have a meeting with them , but not a motivational meeting			0
just a meeting to try to analyse a few things , a few images			0
never about the emotional side of it , or the motivational side of it			2
' @entity57 will face his old club for the first time when the two sides meet on sunday			2

@entity1 's @entity0 are unbeaten and top of the @entity2
but @entity101 *manager* does n't expect them to emulate @entity8
@entity4 won @entity2 without losing a game in 2003 - 04
@entity1 says that was ' once in a lifetime achievement '
@entity0 take on @entity9 's side on sunday at @entity47
