by @entity0 published : 10:42 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 10:58 est , 6 january 2014 launching her attack : @entity4 is now suing three government agencies and a number of officials demanding an apology for bringing her into the @entity10 scandal @entity11 socialite @entity4 has launched a fight against the government in an effort to salvage her reputation in the wake of the scandal that brought down the head of the @entity18 and led to the retirement of a second four - star general			1
last year , mrs @entity4 became a secondary participant in then - @entity18 director @entity10 ’ affair with his biographer @entity23 after mrs @entity4 contacted the @entity24 about threatening emails she received from @entity23			1
during an ensuing search of her email records , the @entity24 publicly announced that she had ‘ inappropriate ’ email conversations with general @entity29 as well			2
@entity10 stepped down from his position at the @entity18 over his affair , general @entity29 retired , and @entity23 went into hiding			1
mrs @entity4 also went into hiding , but now she has spoken out about how she feels it was unjust for her to be seemingly forced into a defensive position even though she believes she did nothing wrong			2
‘ just because you ’re stalked by a mistress does n’t mean you are one … it ’s not contagious , ’ she said in an interview with the @entity39			0
all of the parties involved in the tumultuous scandal - @entity10 , @entity23 , @entity29 and @entity4 - were all married to other people , but @entity4 claims that @entity10 and @entity23 were the only two that had a romantic relationship			2
mrs @entity4 , with her cancer surgeon husband @entity48 at her side , is fighting back against the federal government for releasing her name in connection to the @entity54 investigation and further insinuating an inappropriate connection to @entity56			2
heart of the matter : in 2012 , it was revealed that former general @entity10 , who was the then - @entity18 director , had an affair with his biographer , @entity23 ( seen together in 2011 ) sending messages ? @entity23 sent @entity4 threatening emails while having an affair with @entity10 and posted a cryptic @entity66 message today ( right ) shortly after @entity4 's interview was posted at the time , an unidentified law enforcement official said that mrs @entity4 ’s hundreds emails with general @entity29 were ‘ sexually explicit ’ but she claimed that the most salacious remark in any of their conversations was that the @entity74 - bred @entity70 called her ‘ a sweetheart ’ on a number of occasions			1
‘ i saw the emails … i knew it was complete nonsense , ’ dr @entity4 told @entity78			0
mrs @entity4 has a number of problems with the whole situation - starting with the fact that the @entity24 and other government agencies looked through her emails in the first place , then the fact that they released her name to the public			1
she also now takes issue with the fact that they will not allow her to publicly release those emails in an effort to defend herself as she believes that they will help rehabilitate her reputation			0
‘ i am still suffering the consequences from the bad acts and false and untrue headlines			0
they created a sideshow at my expense , ’ mrs @entity4 said			0
big wigs : @entity29 ( right ) , who - like @entity10 ( center right ) - was a four - star general , also became looped in the scandal because investigators found ' inappropriate ' emails between @entity29 and @entity4 all friends : @entity4 and her husband @entity48 ( center ) hosted a number of parties in @entity114 when @entity10 ( left ) and his wife @entity115 ( right ) were stationed there in 2010 and the couples became friends she argues that the exposure has prevented her from moving past the scandal , saying that she still can not go out publicly to get groceries or attend her children ’s @entity122 pageants			2
the scandal ’s other participants have all made slow entrances back to public life			0
@entity10 is teaching at three different universities and @entity56 has become a counsel to secretary of state @entity130			0
even @entity23 is back on the speaker ’s circuit , lending her name to charitable causes supporting wounded veterans and getting involved in community events in @entity137 , @entity138			0
though she mostly leaves her public remarks to moments behind podiums at charity events , mrs @entity23 posted a rare and rather cryptic tweet this morning , just hours after mrs @entity4 ’s @entity39 interview went live			1
sticking by one another : @entity146 said that he saw all of the emails that the government called ' sexually explicit ' and was fine with them all , as she said the most salacious inclusion was the word ' sweetheart ' hosts : the @entity154 were figures on @entity114 's military - heavy social scene but since the scandal , they say they are forced to rarely leave their house she posted a picture of a @entity167 quote , but given the substance of the matter , it seems like it may be another virtual attack on mrs @entity4 : ‘ as i walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom , i knew if i did n't leave my bitterness and hatred behind , i 'd still be in prison			1
’ mrs @entity4 is sticking to clear public and legal wrangling in an effort to clear her name , suing three federal agencies and a number of @entity24 and @entity181 officials who she claims violated her privacy by searching her email and releasing her name			1
‘ people do n’t understand what i went through , ’ she told @entity78 .			0
