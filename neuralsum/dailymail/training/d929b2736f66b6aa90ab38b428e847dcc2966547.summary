by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 08:32 est , 21 june 2013 a movie trailer masquerading as a @entity3 tampon advert that features a brutal shark attack has sparked controversy following its release			0
playing on the fact that sharks can detect blood in the water , the ad , apparently created for @entity12 , shows two glamorous women enjoying the beach			2
but when they decide to go for a swim , one is savagely attacked by a shark just moments after entering the water			0
a message then pops up on the screen reading : ' @entity12 : now @entity36 '			1
while it is only being shown on @entity3 screens for now , the advert is in @entity39 , leading many viewers to presume it will hit @entity43 screens soon			0
shark attack : whilst she is swimming , the dark - haired woman is viciously attacked by a ravenous shark gory : the woman 's blood and limbs can be seen flying out of the water in the spoof tampon advert , a promotional video for upcoming film @entity54 unsurprisingly , the ad has sparked a strong reaction on social media			1
one @entity59 use wrote : ' not your usual girly ad , this @entity3 @entity12 commercial is way cooler + involves a shark attack			2
' but another failed to see the funny side , reading : ' enough with the @entity3 @entity12 commercial , everyone			0
a woman being attacked by a shark for not using the right @entity12 is n't funny			1
' warning : after the brutal attack , a message pops up on the screen which states : ' @entity12 : now @entity36 ' controversy : @entity59 users have been confused as to whether the @entity75 video is a genuine ad or a spoof			1
in fact , it is the latter - a promo for new film @entity54 according to the advert 's @entity75 ' about ' section , it is n't actually an official advert for @entity12 at all but rather a promotional video for upcoming film @entity54			1
movie 43 is a series of interconnected short films following a washed - up producer and features some of the biggest stars in @entity93 like @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			0
one @entity59 user added : ' surprised at the amount of people believing the " @entity101 " ad from " @entity54 " is a real commercial from @entity3 tv			0

the clip shows a woman being viciously attacked by shark , ending with a message that says : ' @entity12 : now @entity36 '
the ' ad ' is not actually promoting @entity12 , rather a promotional video for upcoming film @entity54
