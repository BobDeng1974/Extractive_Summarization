by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:56 pm on 5th january 2012 @entity2 leaves his employment tribunal in @entity4 , where he claimed he was unfairly sacked as a parking attendant by @entity6 because he refused to issue large numbers of tickets a parking warden with a conscience was sacked for refusing to issue large numbers of tickets to ' extract as much cash as possible ' from motorists , a tribunal heard			1
@entity2 , 45 , claims that fellow wardens referred to their company as ' @entity16 and the 40 thieves ' and that there was ' severe pressure ' to issue more than 10 parking tickets per shift			1
mr @entity2 , who worked for @entity22 and @entity23 's parking firm @entity6 , claims top - performing wardens were rewarded with ' plenty of favours in return			1
' bosses even cited one colleague as an ' excellent example ' for issuing 35 tickets , known as @entity32 ( @entity33 ) in a single shift , and manager said it was ' good revenue for the @entity23 and that everyone should generate the same revenue as him			2
' mr @entity2 , of @entity39 , south @entity4 , was sacked in february last year following more than three years ' service after tipping off a driver who was about to be given a ticket by another warden			1
@entity6 contract manager @entity44 told him in a letter : ' you informed the owner of the car that a @entity33 was being issued with apparent disregard for the safety and well - being of the issuing enforcement officer			2
' however , mr @entity2 told a @entity53 : ' it soon became clear that it was commonly accepted amongst my work colleagues that the whole operation of @entity57 in the @entity22 was dishonest and mainly designed to extract as much cash as possible , via both fair means or foul , from the motoring public			1
' i have seen during the course of my employment ... things which i would never imagined could exist in a modern country like @entity65 , which i have always understood and believed upheld and applied the law in a fair , open and even handed manner			0
' he claims he saw two female colleagues reduced to tears after being berated by the management for not bringing back a sufficient number of @entity32			0
he quickly came under ' severe pressure ' to issue a minimum of 10 @entity32 per shift , he claims , but was informed that ' ten @entity33 's per shift was a poor performance but was considered just about acceptable			1
'' he said : ' we were always told that double figures , i.e. 10 or more @entity32 , was the minimum number that we should be aiming for on every shift			0
' later on , he said , it became ' common knowledge ' that if they issued at a rate below 0.9 @entity32 per hour that @entity6 would fire you			0
' a traffic warden for @entity22 council ( above ) , where mr @entity2 ( not pictured here ) had worked for more than three years when he was sacked even this reduced target was ' impossible to achieve in an entirely legal and honest manner ' he said			1
in december 2009 , he came across an email from @entity91 , a top @entity6 manager , stating : ' there are still a significant number of people issuing at a rate of below 0.9 per hour ... we should not be uncomfortable about using the disciplinary process			0
' he said : ' it seems that all @entity6 managers ' primary aim is to make sure that a particular number of @entity32 are issued and they do n't really care just how the targets are hit			0
' i really did not agree with these highly dodgy practices of issuing parking tickets while bypassing rules and regulations			0
' @entity23 resident @entity110 , a former marketing director , has studied law so that he can represent mr @entity2 at the hearing			1
a wealth of @entity23 residents and shop owners have also written statements to the tribunal in his support			2
the reverend canon @entity119 , of @entity121 , wrote : ' mr @entity2 was courteous and tactful and took enormous trouble to do his job ... i always thought he was an object lesson in how to do a tricky job well ... i was delighted to see him giving traffic wardens a good name			2
' while @entity128 , sales manager at @entity129 on @entity130 , said : ' thanks to mr @entity2 we have experienced some changes			2
' all our customers suffer a lot less stress knowing that they have a ' timed ' right to load their shopping without risking a fine			0
' mr @entity2 is claiming unfair dismissal and interim relief for being a trade union representative			1
the company denies the claims			0
@entity143 , @entity6 spokesman said : ' @entity6 can not comment on the specifics of this particular case which is being heard at an @entity53			0
' we instruct all of our civil enforcement officers ( @entity147 ) to issue tickets according to clear rules and regulations			2
neither @entity6 nor our officers have any incentive , financial or otherwise , linked to the issue of penalty charge notices and we are very strictly regulated to ensure any tickets issued are legitimate			1
' our staff perform an important public service , keeping the streets clear , traffic flowing and ensuring that all drivers have fair access to parking spaces			0
