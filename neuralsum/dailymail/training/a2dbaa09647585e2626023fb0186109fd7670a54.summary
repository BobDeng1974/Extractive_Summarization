by @entity0 published : 08:14 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 08:56 est , 27 october 2013 this is the moment a hungry mongoose was sent running for his life after trying to capture an adder			1
the feline prowling @entity8 's barren desert crept towards the unsuspecting reptile as it lay curled up in the sand			1
but just inches away , his dinner fought back , baring its venomous fangs			1
petrified , the attempted attacker leaped into the air and bounded away to his companion			0
it is a rare moment of prey trumping predator in @entity8 's harsh and wild animal kingdom			1
pounce : the yellow mongoose , normally prey for big snakes , is sent running after trying to grab this adder amateur wildlife photographer @entity24 was having a picnic with his wife when they saw the fight about to break out			1
but he was stunned when he actually managed to capture the exact moment dinner decided to fight back - and the mongoose fled empty handed			1
the stunning photo shows both animals mid-pounce - although both eventually escaped unharmed			0
although its cousin , the @entity36 @entity35 , is famed for being able to single - handedly kill and eat lethal cobras , this species is not famed for its hunting			0
this mongoose had been circling mr @entity41 's table with a pack of companions on the hunt for crumbs			0
however , they all fled in one moment after catching sight of the puff adder			2
mr @entity24 said : ' suddenly their attention was not on our fried eggs and bacon anymore , and the group of mongoose rushed over to the other side of the gravel road with real purpose in their stride - something was up			1
approach : the attempted attacker creeps across the @entity8 desert with a companion for support confident : finally ready to go it alone , it seems like the cost is clear , with the reptile lying still in the sand ' all the yellow mongoose were gathering in a circle , snarling , yapping and biting at something			1
' i rushed to grab my camera to capture some of the action			0
' the yellow mongoose kept crawling up to the puff adder , launching into attack mode , but then retreating back as fast as anything as the puff adder struck back from his coiled position			1
' this went on for quite a while as the puff adder made his way into the dirt road			2
it was time for us to leave when i told my wife : " just a couple more shots ! " ' by now there was only one yellow mongoose harassing the snake			2
as i was about to take my final shot , the @entity98 launched at the one remaining mongoose one final time with brilliant speed			0
' i was lucky enough to take the picture at just the right time to capture the moment , catching the @entity106 as it jumps away from the puff adder 's venomous fangs , and the puff adder pressing hard against the sand for traction to strike out as fast as possible			2
' it was an amazing moment to capture and one i will treasure forever			0
' hungry : they hung around photographer @entity24 's wife , @entity115 , as she ate before going for the snake small : the @entity106 species is not famed for hunting , unlike the @entity36 @entity119 which can kill cobras sometimes referred to as a red meerkat , it is a small creature - growing up to half a kilogram in weight and 20 inches in height at most			1
they are carnivorous , feeding off eggs , small snakes , and lizards - but bigger snakes and birds of prey are their predators			0
meanwhile adders , found everywhere from @entity136 in @entity137 to the outback of @entity139 , can be highly dangerous to anyone that comes into contact with them			0
the only deadly snake to live in @entity145 , they have the most highly developed venom - injecting mechanism of all snakes worldwide			2
normally not aggressive , animals that leave them alone do not have to live in fear			0
but when attacked , few predators will get away scot - free .			0
