a lawyer who was by the side of corporal @entity2 in his final moments after being fatally shot has described the outpouring of love , support and aide she and other strangers used to try and keep the young man alive			1
@entity10 was on her way to a meeting on wednesday morning when she passed the @entity13 , stopping to take a few photos of the guards on duty before heading off on her way			1
seconds later , she heard four shots and , knowing exactly what had happened , ran not away from the noise but back towards the @entity13 and @entity2			1
with four people already laying over the solider , and doing everything they could to help him , @entity10 also got involved			1
a nurse on her way to work , @entity37 , and another solider who was on guard were busy applying pressure to his wounds so as to stop his bleeding			2
a fellow passerby was working to elevate the 24 - year - old 's feet while a fellow corporal was by his head talking to him			1
' you ’re doing good , you ’re doing good , buddy , ' he told @entity2			1
' you ’re breathing - keep breathing			2
' gone to soon : @entity2 ( on left ) photographed just minutes before he was fatally shot stand - up guy : the 24 - year - old ( above ) would eventually die in the arms of the five strangers who worked to save him @entity10 , who was recounting her story for @entity59 , she got down , loosened the solider 's tie , said a prayer , and also began speaking to the brave young corporal , telling him , ' you ’re a good man , you ’re a brave man			1
' he soon stopped breathing and lost his pulse , but the team of five strangers kept doing everything they could for @entity2			1
they started compressions and lifted his legs higher and alternated giving the man @entity74			2
and @entity10 kept on talking			1
you ’re a good man , ' she told him			2
' your family loves you			0
your parents are so proud of you			0
your military family loves you			0
all the people here , we ’re working so hard for you			0
' unfortunately her words , and the hard work of the five strangers , could not save @entity2			1
he died in their arms as paramedics arrived and began to work on him			2
@entity37 , who actually watched the entire horrifying incident go down , says she did not even believe it was real at first			0
' i thought , " it stands to reason , they 're having a drill , " ' she told @entity95			0
' then i thought , " they 're having a theater piece , " because the shooter , with his long gun , it was so incongruous			0
it did n't look real at all			0
' hero : @entity37 ( above ) was also on the scene helping @entity2 then , she saw the shooter fire , and rushed into action			1
just do n't call her a hero			0
' there were four or five people around this fallen soldier working as a team			0
i 'm uncomfortable with the term hero			0
it was everybody focused on him			0

@entity10 , a lawyer in @entity120 , had just *walked* pass the @entity29 when corporal @entity2 was shot on wednesday morning
she immediately ran back and tried to save the man , with the help of four strangers who stayed with him as he waited for help
@entity2 would *ultimately* die in their arms
