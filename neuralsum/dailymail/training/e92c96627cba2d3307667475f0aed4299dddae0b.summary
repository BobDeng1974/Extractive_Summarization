@entity0 was unaware a flea had buried into his foot after working in @entity3 a backpacker was left horrified after a flea and hundreds of eggs burst out of his foot following a trip to @entity3			1
geography graduate @entity8 , 22 , was unaware a tiny chigoe flea had burrowed into his flesh and was feeding off his blood until weeks later when he had flown back to @entity12			1
he was sitting on his bed at home in @entity15 when he felt a tingling sensation and suddenly the black bug burst through his skin and onto his bedclothes – followed by hundreds of tiny eggs			1
mr @entity8 had spent the summer working as a volunteer in rural @entity3 after completing his studies at @entity23 and returned at the beginning of september			1
he had been warned about the chigoe – or jigger flea as it is known locally – but had no idea he had been carrying one in his foot			1
he said : ‘ i looked down to see a lump and thought “ what on earth is that ? ” ‘ a tiny black bug dropped out , followed by 100 little white eggs tumbling after it			2
‘ i had an idea of what it was because while i was out there one of my friends also got it in one of her toenails			0
’ he added : ‘ this type of tic lives in the sand over there , so if you ’re walking around in flip flops it burrows into your skin			0
‘ it seems this insect used me as a free ticket back to @entity3 only to pop out a month later			2
’ mr @entity8 has been left with a small crater close to his little toe where the bug was nesting but doctors have given him the all clear			1
the chigoe flea is the smallest flea known to man at just 1mm and is usually extremely hard to spot			1
the parasitic arthropod is found in most tropical and sub-tropical climates and males feed on warm - blooded hosts , such as humans , cattle , sheep , dogs and mice and return to the sand			0
however females burrow head - first into the host ’s skin and lay dozens of eggs , leaving just the tip of their abdomen exposed			2
the small hole where the flea had been living with its hundreds of tiny eggs			1
they came tumbling out this week a diagram of a pregnant female chigoe flea , similar to the one that buried itself into mr @entity0 's foot when the eggs hatch they tumble out of the abdomen while the flea dies			1
@entity8 added : ‘ i was n’t expecting all the eggs to come out of my foot			2
i wrapped it all in toilet paper and flushed it down pretty quickly			0
‘ i thought if they are going to hatch i would rather not see			0
the tic was proper fat , so i got rid of that pretty quickly too			0
mr @entity0 , pictured right while in @entity3 , has been given the all clear by doctors after the flea burst out of his foot ( right ) ‘ it was n’t painful , it was like a tingling sensation			1
it ’s fine now , it has left like a crater sort of shape in my foot			2
’ he added : ‘ it was pretty creepy			0
i ’ve basically acted as a walking incubator for a month without knowing or giving my permission			0
‘ i was n’t sure whether to laugh at the situation or run into my kitchen hysterically shouting at 3am to cut my foot off with a carving knife			0
’ he had spent the summer volunteering in @entity120 after completing his studies at @entity23			0
