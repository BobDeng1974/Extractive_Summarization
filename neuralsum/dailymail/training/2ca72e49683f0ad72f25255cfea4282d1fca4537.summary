fears of a run on @entity3 banks grew last night as it emerged investors withdrew £ 6billion from the country in the run - up to the election of the far - left @entity10 party			1
@entity11 , the fiercely anti-austerity prime minister , has pledged to renegotiate the terms of @entity3 ’s £ 185billion bailout from the @entity14 and @entity15 , claiming the repayments are crippling			1
he wants longer to pay – and a ‘ haircut ’ the writing - off of a chunk of the debt			1
@entity22 chancellor @entity21 has ruled out the latter option , jeopardising @entity3 banks that heavily rely on funds from the @entity25			1
there is also concern that @entity10 ’s success could signal victories for anti-austerity parties elsewhere			2
in @entity52 , @entity51 is threatening a similar breakthrough in an election later this year			0
the party ’s leader , @entity55 , said : ‘ the @entity3 are going to have a true @entity3 president and not a delegate of @entity22 chancellor @entity21 , who will put the interests of his country and his people first			1
@entity62 is coming , fear is fleeing			0
we are hoping we will hear the same thing in @entity52 soon			0
’ but @entity52 ’s conservative prime minister , @entity66 , warned voters against following @entity3 ’s example : ‘ we can not bet our future and that of our children in a frivolous game of @entity75 roulette			2
’ chancellor @entity76 said mr @entity11 ’s demands appeared ‘ incompatible ’ with membership of the @entity80 single currency			2
symbolism : @entity11 lays flowers on the @entity83 in @entity84 , on the site where on may 1 , 1944 , 200 communist resistance fighters and political prisoners were executed by @entity22 soldiers making history : a tie-less @entity11 , aged just 40 , being sworn in as prime minister yesterday all smiles : the party leader in a bouyant mood yesterday - but the battles will begin almost immediately he and @entity95 backed mrs @entity21 ’s insistence that there was no prospect of cancelling @entity3 ’s debts			1
but @entity100 opened up another coalition rift – and risked infuriating allies in @entity22 and @entity103 – by insisting a deal must be done with mr @entity11			1
‘ there is no reason for the situation in @entity3 to lead to another eurozone crisis , said the @entity110 business secretary			2
‘ several @entity80 countries have enjoyed substantial debt relief in the past and many emerging economies have done so in more recent times			0
‘ and whilst we ca n’t expect government creditors to sign a blank cheque , i hope @entity80 leaders will sit down urgently for discussions with the new @entity3 government			2
‘ we need a sensible outcome coupled with much needed economic reforms to provide eurozone growth			0
the revival of growth and success in the eurozone is in @entity130 ’s best interests , for the success of the many millions of @entity130 jobs linked to trade with @entity80			0
’ @entity10 fell just short of an outright majority in @entity3 ’s parliamentary election , winning 149 of 300 seats			1
but mr @entity11 was sworn in as prime minister with the support of the right - wing @entity138 , who won 13 seats			1
they are also violently anti-austerity			0
jubilant : @entity10 fell just short of an outright majority in @entity3 ’s election , but that did n't stop its supporters emotional : a supporter reacts as projections suggested @entity10 was due to receive around 149 seats mr @entity11 , a 40 - year - old former communist , is demanding a @entity80 debt conference that would abolish or restructure large amounts of @entity3 debt , as was done for post-war @entity22 in 1953			1
in a provocative move , apparently designed to tap into a growing anti-german sentiment in @entity3 , his first act as prime minister yesterday was to lay a rose at a memorial to @entity3 victims of the @entity162			2
a @entity22 finance ministry spokesman reiterated @entity166 ’s opposition to debt forgiveness , saying : ‘ you know our attitude to a debt cut			1
’ however , an extension of @entity3 debt was a ‘ possibility ’			1
mr @entity95 said the failures of previous economic plans in @entity3 had led to the rise of @entity10			1
‘ what the @entity3 elections show is that you need to have an economic plan that works , ’ added the prime minister			2
‘ the @entity3 voters were revolting against failure , economic failure ; a country whose economy had shrunk , whose unemployment was unacceptably high and they could n’t see a secure future			2
' there are some warning signs , some danger signs in the global economy – instability in the eurozone , less rapid growth from the developing economies – these warning signs point even more to the importance of sticking to our long - term economic plan that is delivering rather than taking a risk with the people who got us into this mess			0
’ @entity3 's prime minister @entity11 waves to the members of media as he arrives at @entity210 @entity212 leader @entity211 said : ‘ this is a desperate cry for help from the @entity3 people , millions of whom have been impoverished by the euro experiment			1
‘ an extraordinary game of poker will now begin with chancellor @entity21			0
for too long the @entity3 have been the sacrificial lamb on the altar of a failed federalist project – the euro			0
‘ being in the wrong currency union has imposed a financial and social nightmare on the @entity3 people , from which they are now waking up			0
’ @entity229 , a former @entity230 frontbencher , said last night : ‘ the foreign imposition of punitive fiscal constraints on a sovereign state often has the effect of undermining both democracy and stability , as shown most dramatically after the @entity237			0
‘ this may be the opportunity to start a serious debate in @entity80 on the future of the @entity14			0
’ the man who is tipped to become @entity3 ’s next finance minister used poetry to make a point on @entity245 yesterday			0
@entity246 said : ‘ the light came yesterday when the @entity3 democracy chose , to quote your very own @entity249 , to stop going gently into the night , and to rage against the dying of the light			0

@entity10 leader @entity11 wants longer to repay part of £ 185bn bailout
@entity257 wants debt - *wiping* conference similar to that for @entity22 in 1953
@entity22 insists @entity3 's debt will not be cut - but could be extended
