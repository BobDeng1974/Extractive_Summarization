the early hours of november 4 , 1902 , and police constable no. 472 of the @entity1 was walking his beat in the mean streets around @entity4 in @entity5			1
he had just turned into @entity6 , an unlit alley off @entity7 , when he heard a faint cry			2
flashing his torch , he realised that the noise came from a bundle of rags left on the freezing pavement			2
when he bent down to investigate , he saw that the bundle contained a baby boy			2
that foundling grew up to be my grand - father			1
in old age , he wrote a vivid fragment of childhood memoir , recording everything he knew about the remarkable journey that began — and almost ended — on the @entity5 streets that cold winter night			2
@entity25 ( pictured ) was found in a dark alley behind @entity4 in 1902 by police constable no. 472 of the @entity1 while he was walking his beat it was the early 20th century and @entity28 — the area around @entity4 — was a slum district , home to the rackety street life that accumulates in places where people are constantly on their way to somewhere else			1
in the middle of @entity28 stood the @entity35 , and it was there that the foundling was taken			1
he was arbitrarily assigned a birthday of may 1 , 1902 , baptised @entity25 after the street where he was found ( his surname was later altered to @entity43 ) and despatched to an orphanage at @entity45 , near @entity46			1
that first @entity47 in the orphanage was one of many lonely childhood @entity49 he would spend in institutions or foster care with people who treated him unkindly , until at last his fortunes took a happier turn			1
his memories of childhood began at the orphanage			2
the first thing he could recall was being roughly bathed by a nursemaid who threatened to fill his mouth with soap if he did n’t stop crying for his favourite nurse , @entity65			2
she was , he wrote later , ‘ my first friend , and i often remembered her kindness in my small world of unkindness ’			2
when @entity72 was five years old , he was sent to board with foster parents in the @entity75 village of @entity76			1
back then , there were no particular qualifications for being a foster parent			1
any married couple or ‘ respectable widow ’ could apply , as long as they were recommended by a @entity84 clergyman			2
when @entity72 ( pictured ) was five years old , he was sent to board with foster parents in the @entity75 village of @entity76 a weekly payment of four shillings was a powerful incentive to foster a child at a time when a farm labourer earned around 14 shillings a week			1
@entity72 ’s first impressions of his foster mother were not encouraging			1
‘ the very size of her , together with her dress and appearance , was forbidding and frightening , ’ he wrote			0
bewildered and miserable , he sobbed as he followed this terrifying person to the cottage that was to be his new home			0
the house was small , with a living room and scullery on the ground floor , two bedrooms on the first floor — where his foster mother , her meek husband and their three children , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , slept — and a little attic bedroom where @entity72 was quartered			1
the floor was bare boards , the only light came from a small latticed window on the landing , and the eaves sloped so sharply that he could reach out and touch them as he lay in bed			0
all his life , @entity72 suffered from nightmares of being crushed , which he was convinced came from being confined in this cramped room			1
his forebodings about his foster mother proved cruelly justified			1
with a reputation in the village as a shrew and a scold , she bullied her husband and children — but reserved her worst unkindness for her orphan foster son			1
when he tried to dispose of the disgusting boiled - suet pudding she dished up every monday by hiding it in his pockets , she sewed them up			0
she dosed him forcibly with laxatives and beat him with a stick that hung on the kitchen wall			1
when her husband tried to protect the child , she beat him as well			1
when the couple ’s eldest son , @entity112 , died of pneumonia , things became even harsher			0
@entity72 ’s foster mother seemed to blame him for being alive while @entity112 was dead			1
@entity72 was no longer allowed to play with his foster siblings , forbidden even to speak to them and eventually banished from the family table at mealtimes			1
instead , he had to eat standing up in the pantry , using the mangle as a table			0
the worst thing of all , he remembered , was being made to hand back his @entity160 uniform within an hour of getting it			0
it had been given to him by the local vicar , and @entity72 wore it home proudly , but his foster mother — who seemed to loathe anything that made him happy — forced him to take it off			1
she then bundled it into a parcel and told him to return it to the vicarage			0
that final cruelty turned into one of the rare strokes of good fortune that changed the direction of my grandfather ’s life			0
the vicar of @entity181 ’s , @entity182 , was @entity183 , a kind , cultivated man who was an expert in church music			0
@entity72 had a good treble voice and sang in the church choir			1
when he arrived , disconsolate , to return his @entity160 uniform , @entity188 decided that something must be done			0
he was one of three boys in his year selected to take the scholarship exam for @entity192 , although he was successful it was decided that @entity72 's ( pictured ) future lay in the @entity195			1
he arranged for @entity72 to move to a different foster home with @entity197 , the village postmistress			1
she had married a soldier who fought in the @entity200 but he was killed in an accident within a few months of the wedding and she brought up their son alone , with a succession of foster children			2
she was brave , hard - working and kind , and my grandfather stayed in touch with her until the end of her long life			0
she is there in his wedding photos — a sweet - faced woman in a cloche hat — and i have a faint childhood memory of visiting a very old lady in a black dress , who sat very upright in a high - backed chair beneath a stained - glass window			0
for the first time in his life , @entity72 learned what it was to be an ordinary boy in a pre-war village in rural @entity75			1
he went fishing for sticklebacks , keeping a sharp look - out for the big pike that was said to lurk in the stream and attack small boys			0
he rode the roundabouts at the village fair , where he marvelled at the strong man and the bearded lady			0
he carried stone gallon jars of beer to the farm - workers at harvest - time , and earned halfpennies to spend on bags of broken biscuits by helping the old man who wound the church clock			2
when @entity72 married @entity248 , he gained a family at last — she was the youngest of 13 children of a @entity5 publican and his wife ( pictured here on their wedding day ) he was a bright little boy , and although his ill - treatment in his first foster home had left him with a crippling stammer , he thrived at school			1
he was one of three boys in his year to take the scholarship exam for @entity192			0
all three were successful but the @entity261 of @entity35 — shadowy figures who still had the power to decide @entity72 ’s fate — concluded that he was n’t eligible to accept the scholarship			1
instead they decided that his future lay in the @entity195			0
more than 50 years later , my grandfather wrote : ‘ i do n’t remember being very sorry for myself at the news			0
the fact that i was to leave the village was itself a matter of great excitement and yearning			0
i was perhaps conscious that there were better things elsewhere			0
’ in earlier moments of despair , he added , he had often thought of running away to sea			0
the event that really troubled him came two years later			0
before joining the @entity195 he was required to swear his age before a local magistrate			0
he was given an envelope to hand to the magistrate , and when he looked at the documents inside , @entity72 had a huge shock			1
@entity72 's story is one of sadness and hardship but also courage and resilience			1
he is pictured here with his wife @entity294 and their two granddaughters he ’d always thought that his parents had given him up to an orphanage			2
no one had explained that he was a foundling — with no family at all			1
‘ i ’d always hoped that one day i would be reunited with my real father and mother , and perhaps with brothers and sisters , ’ he wrote			0
‘ i was more conscious than ever of being alone			0
’ it was n’t until i had a baby of my own that i realised there was an even more poignant layer of sadness to his story			0
the truth is that my grandfather was n’t a newborn when he was found but a healthy baby of about six months			2
for half a year , someone had taken good care of him before some desperate circumstance forced her to conclude he would be better off lying on the cold ground in a dark alley on a winter ’s night than staying with her			0
but if my grandfather ’s story is one of hardship , cruelty and loss , it is also one of courage , resilience and cheerfulness			0
after joining the @entity195 as a boy sailor , he retired at the commissioned rank of lieutenant commander			0
he missed @entity339 by a month but served on convoys during @entity341 and was mentioned in despatches			0
and when he married my grandmother , @entity248 , he gained a family at last — she was the youngest of 13 children of a @entity5 publican and his wife			2
@entity72 and @entity294 had a daughter and two granddaughters — my sister and me			1
and some of my happiest childhood memories are of sitting with him at this time of year , listening to his stories of when he was a little boy — all alone in the world and dreaming of running away to sea .			2

@entity356 was found by a @entity357 walking his beat
the foundling was taken to the @entity35 in @entity28
he was sent to foster parents in @entity75 aged 5 but did *n't* have a happy time
@entity72 finally found *happiness* and *normality* with his second foster family
