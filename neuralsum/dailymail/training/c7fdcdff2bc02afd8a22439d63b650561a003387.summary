courageous : @entity1 of @entity2 was caught in two blasts in her first week on the frontline a female @entity7 medic hit by two bomb blasts in her first week is back on the frontline after insisting on being allowed to return to @entity10			1
@entity11 suffered serious injuries , including deafness and deep shrapnel wounds , after being caught in an ied blast on routine patrol just days into her first tour in in @entity19 - e @entity18			1
the 22 - year - old , from @entity21 , @entity2 , had already saved the life of a comrade who lost a leg earlier in the week following a similar blast whilst part of a similar sortie in the troubled @entity28			1
but just three months after both explosions , which left her suffering severe shock , @entity29 has flown back into the warzone because she was so desperate to rejoin her comrades			1
speaking from @entity10 , @entity11 told how returning to frontline action - where she continues to patrol some of the most dangerous hot spots - has seen her accepted by comrades			1
she said : ‘ as a female , you feel you have to prove yourself and show you 're not going to fail them in patrols			1
‘ but once they know you just get on with it , they accept you			1
after that incident , they respected me straight away			1
‘ it sounds horrible and of course you do not want anyone to be injured - but it 's good to put it into practice			1
’ @entity29 added : ‘ you can be the best or the worst soldier , but it does not matter with ieds			1
it is a game of chance			1
‘ i was not at all put off by what happened			2
i am here to do a job ; if there are consequences , you deal with them			2
’ @entity29 was on a routine checkpoint patrol in @entity19 - e @entity18 in april when a comrade seven men down was caught in a horrific blast			1
patrol : soldiers near @entity19 e @entity18 in @entity10 , where @entity29 was on a routine checkpoint patrol in april she rushed forward to stem the flow of blood gushing from his wounds - which probably saved his life - despite the threat of gunfire and other potential @entity81 's			1
the explosion , just 15 minutes away from their destination , caused the soldier to lose one of his legs , but amazingly escape with his life			2
@entity29 said : ‘ i saw the whole explosion but because of the dust cloud , i could n't see what was going on			2
i was about seven men behind but when there was a call for a medic , i ran the fastest i have ever run			2
‘ it sounds cliché , but the training really did kick in			2
it felt good to put my medical skills into use so early on			2
i was holding his hand , telling him he was ok and i felt i was making a difference			2
’ days later , while on another routine foot patrol , she was caught in a second blast , this time causing her extensive injuries including deafness and lacerations			1
‘ i was not at all put off by what happened			2
i am here to do a job ; if there are consequences , you deal with them ’ ‘ i remember the whole incident , ’ she added			0
‘ i saw i was bleeding and remember hoping all my limbs were still there			0
i saw both my legs and both my arms and i was so relieved			0
’ the blast , triggered during a routine patrol , caused serious shrapnel wounds to two other servicemen , one of which was saved but will not return to @entity10			1
the other returned to action after undergoing treatment but later sustained a gunshot wound in a separate incident and is still being treated			0
@entity29 said : ‘ as soon as i was injured , i was n't able to provide any treatment myself			0
there was nothing i could give to the situation			0
‘ but i kept saying i wanted to treat them			0
i was in shock and the lads were having to tell me i was not in the right state to help			1
‘ i feel so lucky about the injuries i sustained			0
it could have been a lot worse			0
‘ i saw i was bleeding and remember hoping all my limbs were still there			0
i saw both my legs and both my arms and i was so relieved ' ‘ it was strange for me to be a casualty , but everyone who dealt with me was absolutely brilliant , from start to finish			0
‘ what this sort of incident does is make you realise how vulnerable you are			0
as a medic , you do n't think you 're the one that 's going to be injured			0
it puts everything into perspective			0
’ lieutenant @entity156 , second in charge ( @entity159 ) of a squadron close support medical group , praised her bravery , adding : ‘ she was blown up twice in her first week and dealt with massive trauma			0
‘ she did not have to come back out , but she wanted to			0
you can not ask any more of someone than that			0
