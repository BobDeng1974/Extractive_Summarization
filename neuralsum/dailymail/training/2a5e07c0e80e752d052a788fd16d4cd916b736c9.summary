by dr @entity0 from spare tyres to muffin tops , hitting the gym is considered a guaranteed way to shift those unwanted lumps and bumps — but is it effective ? dr @entity0 believes gruelling workouts are not the secret to winning the battle of the bulge			1
in fact , he says it ’s one of many misleading weight - loss myths that can cause some people to struggle to slim			1
here , the renowned health journalist , who devised the popular 5:2 diet , explodes some of the most persistent fitness myths			1
myth : exercise is a good way to lose weight believe it or not , it ’s not true that exercise , whether walking or jogging , is a good way to lose weight			1
it can be , but only if you push yourself			1
dr @entity0 says that exercise as a weight - loss technique is a myth the problem is that fat is extraordinarily energy - dense			1
each pound of fat packs in about 3,500 calories			1
the average woman eats about 2,000 calories a day , so that represents nearly two days ’ worth of food			1
so how much exercise would you need to do to burn off 1 lb of fat ? well , if you are a woman weighing 10 st then you will burn about 100 calories running a mile			1
this means you will have to run about 35 miles to get through 1 lb of fat			1
you could do it in one go , which would be tough and possibly dangerous , or run an hour a day at a reasonable pace of 6 mph for six days			1
but even that does n’t guarantee you will lose weight , as it assumes you wo n’t then compensate by eating more , which many people do			1
a recent @entity58 study took 45 overweight young women and split them into two groups			1
@entity61 was asked to cycle at moderate intensity for 40 minutes , three times a week , for 15 weeks			1
the other group did 20 minutes , three times a week , but alternated short , vigorous bursts ( only eight seconds long ) with gentle cycling			1
at the end of the trial , just as they had at the beginning , they had their body fat measured			1
the group doing the short bursts of vigorous cycling had lost an average of 5 lb of fat , but the group doing the moderate cycling put on an average of 1 lb of fat			1
the vigorous cycling probably worked better because of an after - burn effect , as high - intensity exercise revs up your metabolism and leads to the release of hormones like adrenaline , which burn fat			1
it may also be because vigorous exercise tends to suppress appetite			1
if you want to lose weight you need to control your calories , increase your general activity and make sure the exercise you do is intense			1
exercise alone is unlikely to be enough			1
professor @entity103 checked how strong my heart and lungs were by measuring my @entity110 , which is a measure of how much oxygen your body can consume when you ’re pushing yourself			2
the fitter you are , the higher the figure			2
not everyone can get fitter by exercising i then went away and did an intense exercise regime for several weeks			2
yet when i repeated the @entity110 , i got exactly the same score			2
i could n’t believe it			2
professor @entity103 explained there is a huge variation in how people respond to an exercise regime and there is no guarantee of favourable results			2
this is backed up by the findings of a recent study in @entity131			2
they asked 175 untrained , middle - aged men and women to do a 21 - week fitness course			1
the volunteers either did weight - lifting twice a week , endurance training twice a week or a workout that combined strength and endurance training four times a week			2
the results were mixed to say the least			2
some people ’s fitness improved by an impressive 42 per cent , while others became less fit — their @entity110 @entity110 dropped by 8 per cent , a finding that had the researchers baffled			1
there was an even greater spread when it came to the strength exercises , with some people increasing theirs by 87 per cent and others performing 12 per cent worse than at the beginning			2
a number of studies have come up with similar findings			2
as professor @entity103 points out , there is a huge range in people ’s responses to exercise — from super-responders at one end of the spectrum , to non-responders at the other			2
there are almost certainly genetic reasons for this			2
that said , exercise is always a good thing to do			2
while some people , like me , may not improve their aerobic fitness , they will benefit in other ways , such as the way they control their blood sugar			1
myth : exercise in the gym lifts your mood this is a widely held belief , but is it true ? people who do lots of exercise , particularly long - distance runners , report feeling happier and plenty of people get a real kick out of exercise			0
the popular explanation for this is ‘ endorphin release ’			1
these are chemicals produced in response to stress			0
the trouble is that while increased endorphin levels have been measured in the blood of some people after they exercise , it does n’t happen in everyone and it is unlikely the endorphins being measured could have created the euphoric feeling anyway			0
endorphin molecules are too large to cross the blood - brain barrier and reach the brain			0
so exercise may not be quite as effective a mood booster as it ’s sometimes claimed to be			0
the happy feeling we get while exercising is in fact due to the release of chemicals in response to stress a 2012 study at @entity221 backs this up			0
it took 361 patients with depression and divided them into two groups			0
one group continued as normal , the other group doubled its exercise			0
at the end of a year , there was no evidence the exercise had improved their mood or led to less use of anti-depressants			0
as dr @entity242 , from @entity221 ’s @entity243 , acknowledged : ‘ our intervention was not an effective strategy for reducing symptoms			1
’ there is much more evidence to suggest just being outdoors in a green environment will have a positive impact on mood			0
being in a natural setting is closer to how our remote ancestors would have lived			0
so remember , going for a run or walk in the park is more likely to cheer you up than doing the same exercise in a gym			0
myth : if i work out , i can eat lots more thanks to our evolutionary past , when food was scarce and our ancestors were active , our bodies are incredibly efficient at doing things like walking or running			0
you have to do a lot of either to burn even a small amount of calories			0
working out does n't mean you can eat more food without gaining weight i researched how many calories i burn while running by wearing special monitoring equipment and set off at a brisk pace around the athletics track at @entity104			0
the equipment suggested i was burning about 16 calories a minute , which meant that having run just over a mile i had got through 160 calories			0
however , a latte contains about 150 calories , while a chocolate muffin comes in at 500 calories			0
so if you decide to have a relatively small snack like a muffin and latte after your run , you are topping yourself up with 650 calories — far more than what you ’ve burnt off			0
when you are judging the impact of going for a run , you should take into account the fact that you burn a lot of calories just sitting down and doing nothing			0
in fact , most of the calories we burn are consumed keeping our bodies going			0
what you want to know is not the total calorie burn ( @entity305 ) but the net calorie burn ( @entity308 ) , that is how many extra calories you burn by running rather than doing nothing			0
to calculate your net calorie burn from running a mile at a reasonable pace i.e. doing 6 mph , or walking at about 3 mph , then use this formula : net calorie burn from running a mile at about 6 mph = 0.7 x your weight ( in lb )			0
net calorie burn for walking a mile at about 3 mph = 0.4 x your weight ( in lb )			0
i weigh 168 lb , which means my net calorie burn from running a mile is about 117 calories			0
so 117 calories a mile means i would have to run nearly six miles to burn off a muffin and latte			0
or i could walk nine miles			0
best to leave that muffin alone .			0
