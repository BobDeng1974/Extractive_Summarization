@entity0 has unveiled its @entity2 concept car as part of its 50th birthday celebrations			1
the design of the @entity2 , which means ' selfish ' in @entity6 , was inspired by an @entity8 helicopter and has carbon fibre and aluminium frame - traditionally seen on lightweight f1 cars			1
and just like @entity13 cars , the @entity2 has been made for one person only , and to get out of the car drivers must remove the steering wheel , lift up the roof and climb over the bodywork			1
the concept car only seats one person and the driver must remove the steering wheel and climb over the carbon fibre bodywork to get into the vehicle			1
the interior of the @entity2 has minimal instruments			1
a removable steering wheel column sits in the centre			1
above it is a heads - up display , similar to those seen by jet fighters , showing only important driving information			0
when the driver climbs out of the vehicle he can only rest his legs on the designated areas , so not to crush or damage the carbon fibre frame the car 's ' cockpit ' is covered by a mechanically operated orange shield			1
the shield has anti-glare glass and is made of antiradar material			0
the driver 's four - point seatbelt is made up of different colours as part of @entity54 's @entity53 , owners , collectors and fans drove various @entity0 models from the @entity6 firm 's 50 year history across @entity6			1
the parade began on friday in @entity59 before heading to @entity60 , and @entity61			0
it then continured to @entity63 and ended at @entity64 , the @entity0 headquarters , on saturday			0
a total of 350 of the @entity6 supercars are taking part in the @entity53			1
@entity0 is celebrating its anniversary throughout 2013 with events all over the world			0
the company gave 10 per cent of the money made on the tour to a fund for rebuilding social centres destroyed by an earthquake in the @entity78 region of @entity6 , last year			1
the car was unveiled by @entity0 's president and ceo @entity81 at an event in @entity6			1
it was designed by @entity84 for @entity85 , @entity20			0
speaking on the final day of the @entity53 - @entity0 's tour around @entity6 to celebrate its 50th anniversary - @entity20 said : ' this is a car made for one person only , to allow them to have fun and express their personality to the maximum			1
' it is designed purely for hyper - sophisticated people who want only the most extreme and special things in the world			0
' it represents hedonism taken to the extreme , it is a car without compromises			2
' the interior of @entity2 has a racing seat with four - point seatbelt , and each strap is a different colour			1
there is also a head - up display , similar to those seen by jet fighters , showing speed , fuel levels and other important information			0
the @entity2 has 5.2 - litre v10 engine with 592 brake horse power			1
@entity2 's designer @entity20 designed the car to look like the profile of a ' bull preparing to charge , its horns lowered ' , based on @entity0 's famous icon			1
it has two white front lights , two red rear lights , a red flashing light in the upper part of the ' tail ' , two orange ' bull 's eyes ' as side markers , and another two lights on the roof			0
to get out of the car , the driver has to remove the steering wheel and rest it on the dashboard , open the dome with an electronic command , stand up in their seat , sit down on a precise point of the left - hand bodywork , then swivel their legs 180 degrees from the inside of the cockpit to the outside of the vehicle			1
the cockpit is completely removable and @entity20 said : ' it is made completely of carbon fiber and aluminum , and represents a sort of survival cell , allowing the driver to isolate and protect themselves from external elements			1
' we kept an eye on the future when designing the @entity2 , with the idea that its cockpit could have been taken from a jet aircraft and integrated into a road vehicle , to provide a different travel option			1
' as the @entity2 is made from lightweight materials including aluminum and carbon - fiber , the vehicle has no - walk zones ; places the driver ca n't stand because his weight would crush the bodywork			1
these zones are marked out like they are on airliners , and are shown at the bottom of this image			0
the exterior is designed to look like the profile of a ' bull preparing to charge , its horns lowered '			2
this design is based on the @entity0 brand 's icon , and @entity0 's is also known as the @entity185			2
the top of the vehicle has flaps built into the bodywork that move depending on the driving conditions			1
two rear flaps activate automatically at high speeds to increase stability , while a series of air intakes on the back of the engine hood provides the cooling air flow to the powerful @entity200 engine			0
the v10 engine sits in the rear of the @entity2			2
also known as the ' tail of the bull ' , it has been designed to be fully open with the mechanics in view			0
this reduces weight but also creates a more aggressive look			0
while the front of the vehicle has a profile intended to increase down force , the rear is fully open with the mechanics in view , reducing weight but also with the result of creating a more aggressive look			2
the @entity2 does not have traditional headlights , instead it has led clearance lights which determine its position in three dimensions , as seen on spacecrafts			2
it has two white front lights , two red rear lights , a red flashing light in the upper part of the tail , two orange ' bull 's eyes ' as side markers , and another two lights on the roof , red on the left and green on the right			0
