the baby is believed to be among the youngest ever to undergo the procedure as part of a criminal inquiry			1
new figures revealed he was among more than 5,000 children in @entity5 to have been swabbed for @entity6 over the last three years			1
they mirror the activities of police across the rest of the nation who insist they follow the law on the taking and retention of personal samples			2
campaigners are growing increasingly concerned that young people could be traumatised by the experience and left on police databases for life			1
@entity31 , who leads @entity32 , said she fears the taking of a child ’s dna is not always necessary or proportionate			2
‘ the police do need to be able to take samples from children in cases sometimes to eliminate samples , ’ she said			1
‘ so a one - year - old would have been present in a house where a crime has taken place and they will need that data			0
' but our concern is about the large numbers of children who are ending up with records on the dna database			2
‘ the process a child can go through can be quite traumatic if a child is arrested for no reason , if it is a false accusation or misunderstanding			0
‘ it can be traumatic to be photographed and fingerprinted and have your dna taken			2
’ the latest figures revealed 5,561 children were swabbed by the four forces in @entity5 as part of their investigations since 2010			1
@entity66 took the most , 2,866 samples , but @entity68 , which took 1,080 samples , swabbed the youngest children			1

since 2010 they have taken 16 samples of kids that age			2
this year @entity83 took 120 samples from under 15s			0
since 2010 they have sampled 483			0
the @entity86 , due to be introduced soon , will mean the dna of children can be removed from databases if they are innocent or only convicted of a minor offence			1
under current legislation , police retain @entity6 samples taken with consent if they could be used in court proceedings , including any possible appeal			2
the @entity86 , due to be introduced soon , will mean the dna of children can be removed from databases if they are innocent or only convicted of a minor offence @entity99 , of civil liberties campaign group @entity100 , said : ‘ i ’m stunned that someone thought it was acceptable to take a dna sample from a one - year - old baby			1
on what possible grounds is that reasonable or necessary ? the @entity108 dna database has grown to become the largest in the world and yet there is little evidence to suggest dna profiling results in a higher sense of public safety			0
’ @entity115 runs the @entity116			0
he said : ‘ these figures show the worrying extent to which children are drawn into criminal investigations			1
‘ it is a cause for concern that more than 5,500 dna samples have been taken from under - 16s in only three and a half years			1
’ @entity68 said : ‘ a total of five dna samples were taken from children between the ages of zero and nine			1
‘ these were volunteer dna elimination samples which were required in order to assist in the investigation of crimes			2
