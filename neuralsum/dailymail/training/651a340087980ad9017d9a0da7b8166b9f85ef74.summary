' the letter says ' our nation is far from what it was and what it should be			2
i have seen so many depressing changes made in my time that i can not imagine what it must be like for you			2
there is so much wrong and on so many levels only passing through the crucible of another revolution can get us back the liberties we once had			2
i do not pretend to know what that revolution will look like or even if it would be successful			2
suspect : @entity7 ( seen in this october 30 mug shot ) has been charged with terrorism			1
authorities have said that @entity7 wrote a letter to his parents , in which he spoke of wanting to start a revolution charged : @entity7 , seen on october 31 , is charged with the murder of @entity5 cpl. @entity52 and critically wounding trooper @entity53 ' tension is high at the moment and the time seems right for a spark to ignite a fire in the hearts of men			1
what i have done has not been done before and it felt like it was worth a try			0
' if i am dead i would like to be buried in a wood casket ( no lead lined casket ! ) so that my remains can return to where they came from			0
i realize that this may not be possible though , laws and what not , so do n't sweat it			0
also , light a candle for me at the @entity76 or @entity77 @entity75 in @entity78 from time to time			0
it does n't need to be during a liturgy , just whenever they are open			0
i am sure you can figure it out			0
' i do not have a death wish but i know the odds			0
i tried my best to do this thing without getting identified , but if you are reading this then i was not successful			0
if i am still alive and free know that i will do my best to remain as such			0
and as time goes by , if circumstances change , if my spark hit good tinder , then i may be able to return one day			0
you guys are great parents , i am just not a good son			2
i squandered so much opportunity and support and rarely tried my best at anything			0
@entity99 knows i do not deserve the things i had , maybe he knew i would be sacrificing all of it in the end , or maybe this is just the final squander			0
please forgive me of my many faults			0
and thanks for putting up with me for so long			0
' scene : debris is strewn about the main room inside the airport hangar on november 4 on abandoned @entity113 grounds in @entity114 , @entity115 where @entity7 was arrested search : authorities launched an extensive manhunt to find @entity7 state police charged @entity7 on thursday with two counts of terrorism			1
he already faced first - degree murder and other counts in the september 12 ambush , which killed @entity18 , seriously wounded another trooper and sparked a 48 - day manhunt in the @entity127			2
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for @entity7 , who appeared by video at a brief hearing at which state police filed the additional charges			1
he has not entered a plea			0
on the night of his capture , @entity7 waived his right to remain silent and told police in an interview at the barracks that he had shot the troopers ' because he wanted to make a change ( in government ) and that voting was inefficient to do so , because there was no one worth voting for , ' according to a criminal complaint			1
' the defendant further acknowledged taking action ( shooting the troopers ) to wake people up because it was all he could do			1
' police found the letter on a storage drive inside an abandoned airplane hangar that authorities believe @entity7 used as a shelter			1
the letter was created on december 29 , 2013 , and was last accessed on october 6 , 2014 , while @entity7 was on the run , the documents said			1
police have said @entity7 had a laptop with him			1
authorities , meanwhile , say they 're not worried that @entity7 's confession could conceivably be challenged by defense attorneys			1
police refused to tell @entity7 that his family had hired an attorney for him the night he was captured , according to defense attorney @entity168 , who said he was prevented from seeing @entity7 at the barracks			1
' i was told , " he 's an adult and has not asked for a lawyer , " ' @entity168 recounted earlier this week			0
district attorney @entity173 has cited @entity175 precedent that says police are n't required to tell a suspect that an attorney is seeking to speak with him or her			2
a more recent state court decision , however , said the @entity175 had not ' eliminated the possibility ' that a defendant 's due - process rights could be violated under similar circumstances .			2
