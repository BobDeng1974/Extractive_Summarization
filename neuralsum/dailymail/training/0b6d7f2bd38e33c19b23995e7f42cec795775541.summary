an alarm clock which forces its owner out of bed to turn it off could be the saving grace for snoozers			1
the robotic clock jumps off your bedside table and runs across the floor on two wheels , leaving big sleepers with no choice but to go after it to stop it emitting a high pitched alarm call			2
when the alarm activates , the wheels propel the clock forwards and can survive drops from surfaces of up to 3ft tall			0
the £ 40 escapist alarm allows a single snooze before it kicks into gear and can travel on wood or carpet surfaces			0
‘ if you let @entity21 go it will easily traverse your bedroom , it always finds its way under your bed , ' @entity37 , sales director at no. 8 brands said			2
‘ first you have to track @entity21 down , then you can hit the alarm button to turn it off			1
' no escape : the alarm allows a single snooze before it sets off over the floor and has a tendency to end up underneath the bed if its owner is not quick enough big jump : ' @entity21 ' can take a fall onto wooden floor from up to 3ft and has no problem running away on soft carpets either ‘ we 've received very positive feedback , we 've had many customers who are heavy sleepers and @entity21 is the only clock that will wake them up			1
’ mr @entity37 explains that although it defies the idea of @entity21 , the wheels can be removed			0
‘ we have had plenty of people who hate how effectively it works , those people love their snooze buttons too much			0
