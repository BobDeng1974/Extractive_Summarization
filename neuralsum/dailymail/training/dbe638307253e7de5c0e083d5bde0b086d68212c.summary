' it is clear that this was a ruthless , bloody provocation , revenge by terrorists for significant losses they have sustained in the confrontation with government forces , ' the @entity225 said in a statement			0
the competing narratives about what caused the blasts highlighted the difficulty of confirming reports from inside @entity5			2
