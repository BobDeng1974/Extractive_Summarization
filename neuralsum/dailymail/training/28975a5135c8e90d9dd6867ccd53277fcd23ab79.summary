by @entity0 last updated at 11:29 am on 18th november 2011 police believe there is enough evidence to charge @entity5 over an alleged racist remark , it was claimed today			1
officers have quizzed a string of players about the @entity12 captain ’s clash on the pitch with @entity14 last month			1
@entity15 captain @entity5 , 30 , came under fire after he allegedly called the @entity17 defender a ‘ f * * * * * * black c * * * ’ during a heated match			1
' racist ' slur ? @entity5 covers his mouth as he 's surrounded by @entity17 players during the heated game at @entity25 , @entity26 , last month police have now compiled evidence from players and video recordings of the game - which show @entity5 ’s lip movements - and are in the process of sending the file to the @entity35 , it is claimed			1
the @entity35 will then decide if the evidence is strong enough to secure a conviction in court			1
they will also have to decide if proceeding with the case is in the public interest			1
‘ there is a feeling among some officers that @entity5 has a case to answer , ’ a source told the @entity42			1
@entity5 categorically denies making the racist slur during @entity12 ’s 1 - 0 @entity49 defeat at @entity25 on october 23 and is fighting to clear his name			1
speaking after the incident , he said : ' i ’ll do whatever it takes to clear my name			1
i do n’t have anything to hide			1
' police are understood to have interviewed @entity5 ’s teammate @entity57 about the incident			1

he is said to have gone into the @entity17 dressing room after the dispute to act as a peacemaker between @entity14 and @entity5			2
@entity5 could be jailed for up to seven years and lose his position at the head of the national team if he is found guilty			2
@entity68 president @entity67 believes players should settle matters with a handshake after the game			2
@entity73 , right , criticised the stance a @entity76 spokesman said today : ' most investigations hypothetically do give their evidence to the @entity35 after this length of time			2
the @entity35 then make a decision			2
that would be normal process			0
' a @entity35 spokesman said : ' cps have not received a file and the police investigation is ongoing			0

’ in an interview with @entity117 , @entity67 stuck to his guns and pointed out that @entity68 had taken the @entity119 to @entity120			0
he added : ‘ but if you also be a little bit in a sporting spirit when there is something happening on the field of play , during a match between two players - i call it foul language			0
i ’m not saying about discrimination , but it ’s foul language , it ’s a foul play			0
‘ at the end of the match , if you have foul play ( when ) the match is over you shake hands ... and therefore also forget what has been on the field of play			0
’ the furore has been heightened by another case of alleged racism on the pitch which has seen @entity144 ’s @entity143 charged by the @entity145 with racially abusing @entity146 .			1
