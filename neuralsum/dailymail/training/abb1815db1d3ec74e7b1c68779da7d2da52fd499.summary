by @entity0 published : 14:35 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:15 est , 5 december 2013 palaeontologists have uncovered a new species of tank - like dinosaur in a century - old @entity8 coal mine			2
the species was discovered after two incredibly - well preserved dinosaurs were unearthed near the town of @entity12 in north eastern @entity8			0
the armoured dinosaurs are believed to have been around five metres long , a metre tall and two tonnes in weight			1
palaeontologists have uncovered a new species of tank - like dinosaur in a century - old @entity8 coal mine			0
the new dinosaur has been named @entity20 @entity20 is part of the nodosauridae family which were around during the @entity23 to the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
like other dinosaurs in the nodosauridae family , @entity20 was a plant - eater and was covered in scaly armoured plates			0
the @entity20 is estimated to have lived 113 million and 110 million years ago during the @entity34 period , making it the oldest nodosaurid discovered in @entity28			1
the specimens initially appeared to belong to a sub-species of armoured dinosaur in the @entity39 , but there were some key differences			1
for instance , @entity42 have triangular heads , whereas these dinosaurs were found to have a rounded , tear - drop - shaped skull as well as a strongly arched pelvis			0
describing their research in the journal @entity51 , researchers named the species @entity20 , which means ‘ @entity28 ’s shield from coal ’			1
earlier this week researchers unveiled two separate armoured dinosaurs discovered in the mine near the town of @entity12 in north eastern @entity8 a skeletal reconstruction of @entity20 carbonensis			2
the unknown parts of the skeleton are shaded in grey @entity20 is part of the nodosauridae family which were around during the @entity23 to the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1

@entity76 , the lead research from the @entity78 , claims that the @entity28 nodosaurids differed from those in @entity25			0
‘ by 113 million years ago nodosaurid ankylosaurs have completely replaced them on both continents , yet are represented by distinctly different subfamilies on both continents , ' he told @entity71			0
as @entity20 is closely related to other nodosaurs in @entity28 , the new finding suggests that @entity28 had become isolated from @entity25 around 110 million years ago - rather than the 80 million years that many suggest			2
the dinosaur fossils were discovered near the town of @entity12 in north eastern @entity8			0

fossils initially appeared to belong to a sub-species of the @entity39
however they had key differences , particularly in the shape of their skull
species was five metres long , a metre tall and weighed two tonnes
researchers have named it @entity20 , which means ‘ @entity28 ’s shield from coal ’
