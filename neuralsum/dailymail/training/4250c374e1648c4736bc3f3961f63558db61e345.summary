@entity2 volcano , one of @entity5 's most active volcanoes , is on the verge of a major eruption that could impact air travel , experts have warned			1
a @entity10 geoscientist believes a ' bulge ' on the northern sign of the volcano is caused by huge deposits of magma rising			1
in 2010 the eruption of @entity5 's @entity1 hampered air travel due to the ash and gas it has spewed into the atmosphere , and there are fears another eruption could cause the same issues			1
the @entity2 volcano , which experts warn is on the verge of erupting for the first time since 2000			2
researchers say there is now more magma than in 2000 , the last time the @entity2 volcano erupted			1
@entity10 geophysicist @entity31 said in a report published in the @entity5 newspaper @entity34 on monday that according to gps monitoring of the expanding surface , there is now more magma underneath @entity2 than before the volcano 's last eruption in 2000 ,			1
@entity2 ' could erupt soon , ' @entity31 said			0
the last eruption at @entity2 started on feb. 26 , 2000 , and lasted for nearly two weeks			0
then , it took just 79 minutes from the first warning earthquake until the volcano exploded , @entity31 said			0
@entity2 volcano has blasted more than 20 times in the last 1,200 years , blanketing southern @entity5 with thick layers of ash and lava			2
some of the eruptions are short and small , while others continue for months , pumping enough ash into the atmosphere to chill temporarily the northern latitudes			0
@entity54 explodes from the @entity2 volcano in an unpopulated area about 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) southeast of @entity5 's capital @entity57 on sunday feb. 27 , 2000			1

volcano watchers have anticipated a new eruption at @entity2 since 2006 , when tiny earthquakes and surface swelling first hinted that new magma had appeared			2
media reports warned of similar surface swelling at @entity2 in 2011 and 2013 , without a subsequent eruption			0
@entity2 , in the background , was believed to be the gateway to purgatory			0

the most prominent sign of an impending eruption is bulging ground on the northern side of the volcano			0
this surface swelling indicates magma ( molten rock ) is rising under the volcano , pushing up the ground as it fills fractures and pipes beneath @entity2 .			2

now more magma than in 2000 , the last time the @entity2 volcano erupted .
