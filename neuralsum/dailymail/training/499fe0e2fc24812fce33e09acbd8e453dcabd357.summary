by @entity0 landing on @entity1 is no easy business			1
in the past small vehicles could land using airbags and regular parachutes			0
but bigger vehicles require much more innovative ways of making it to the surface , leading @entity10 to design a new breed of parachute			1
the reason for its size is to deal with the atmosphere on @entity1			2
@entity23 has a reasonably thick atmosphere , so we can parachute relatively easily to the surface			0
but the @entity1 atmosphere is much thinner , so parachutes need to be much larger in order to create sufficient drag to land safely			2
the system is designed to land large vehicles on the surface of @entity1			1
the @entity35 , for example , needed an innovative landing method due to its size but this technology was n’t ready yet			2
instead , to land the rover on the surface @entity10 developed a landing mechanism that used rockets known as the ‘ sky crane ’			1
the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) is the successor to the @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , pictured , another @entity10 - designed parachute @entity10 has already been testing the strength of the @entity14 using rocket sleds			1
the tests in june will be the first to drop it from the upper reaches of the atmosphere the @entity14 , however , is an alternative way to reach the surface that will be able to land things that are bigger than @entity35 , such as equipment for a manned mission or humans themselves			1
the @entity14 is unique in its design , using a donut - shaped inflatable decelerator to create atmospheric drag			0
when attached to the exterior of a capsule travelling at @entity64 it will be capable of slowing it down to @entity66 , where a regular parachute can then deploy			0
to simulate the @entity1 atmosphere on @entity23 , the @entity14 will be lifted to a height of 37 kilometres ( 23 miles ) by a high - altitude balloon			1
a small rocket will then launch it 18 kilometres ( 11 miles ) higher			0
as this point the @entity14 will inflate around a larger saucer - shaped object , bringing it safely back to land in open water			2
‘ it may seem obvious , but the difference between landing and crashing is stopping , ’ @entity78 , a @entity1 landing expert at @entity10 ’s @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity77 told @entity82			1
‘ we really only have two options for stopping at @entity1 : rockets and aerodynamic drag			0
’ there will be four tests of the @entity14 in total before mission managers decide whether to employ it on future @entity1 missions			1
the tests are taking place over the @entity98 island of @entity99 in june			0
‘ personally i think it ’s a game - changer , ’ @entity100 at the @entity101 in @entity102 said			0
‘ you could take a mass to the surface equal to something like 1 to 10 curiosities			0
‘ think about it like a bridge for humans to @entity1			2
‘ this is the next step in a sequence of technologies that would need to be developed			0

the @entity14 is a giant parachute
it is designed for vehicles that are even bigger than the @entity35 rover
this *includes* manned *spacecraft* that could take humans to @entity1
it has been tested before on rocket sleds
but in june @entity10 will send it into the sky for its first ' test *flight* '
