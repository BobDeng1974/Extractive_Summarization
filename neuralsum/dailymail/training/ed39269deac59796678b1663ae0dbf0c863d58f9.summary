@entity0 is embroiled in a new privacy row after it began selling access to users in order to bolster its profits			1
the social networking site is allowing companies to trawl through its 900m users looking for email addresses and phone numbers so it can better target adverts			0
the changes mean that if you hand over any details when you buy something - as many consumers do - that company can now track you down on @entity0			1
privacy row : the social networking site is allowing companies to trawl through its 900m users looking for email addresses and phone numbers so it can better target adverts the measures appear to be a cynical attempt to sidestep restrictions imposed on @entity0 by @entity31 regulators due to earlier botched privacy changes			1
they have already sparked calls for an official investigation by campaigners who claim that the public have not been properly notified			1
the new measures , which have been in effect for weeks , will affect consumers who have handed over personal data when they buy something , which is the majority of people given the rise of internet shopping retailers will then be allowed to compare their own databases with the information on @entity0			1
not private : the changes mean that if you hand over any details when you buy something - as many consumers do - that company can now track you down on @entity0 for example , an airline will now be able to target adverts at a consumer who had recently taken a flight to @entity60			1
a mobile phone company could also advertise upgrades to somebody who was nearing the end of their contract			0
another disturbing element is that the adverts could appear on a user ’s computer even when they are not on @entity0			1
the social networking site is also increasing its monitoring and will work with @entity31 - based company @entity74 to see what consumers are buying			0
@entity0 claimed that there are safeguards attached to the new measures			1
dear leader : the social networking site , founded by @entity82 ( pictured ) is also increasing its monitoring and will work with @entity31 - based company @entity74 to see what consumers are buying phone numbers and email addresses will be replaced by hash symbols so nobody actually knows who the person is , even if they can track their behaviour			0
users will also have to give permission but campaigners in the @entity31 have said that changing the settings is ‘ confusing and ineffective ’			0
the @entity97 and the @entity98 have already asked watchdog the @entity100 to investigate the arrangement			0
in a joint letter they said : ‘ @entity0 did not attempt to notify users of its decision to disclose user information ‘ neither @entity0 ’s @entity107 nor its statement of rights and responsibilities adequately explains the specific types of information @entity0 discloses , the manner in which the disclosure occurs , or the identities of the third parties receiving the information			1
’ @entity0 is under pressure to improve on the £ 1.1bn it makes each year from advertising after its disastrous stock market floatation which saw its shares fall by more than half their value			2
last year it was forced to overhaul its privacy policy after the @entity100 ruled it had been lying to its users for the past four years			0
the serious violations included allowing other companies access to users ’ personal information - even after they deleted their accounts			0
under the tough agreement - which applies @entity129 - @entity0 agreed to independent periodic monitoring for the next 20 years to stop it from re-offending			2
it also vowed to obtain users ‘ express consent ’ before making privacy changes			0
@entity0 privacy engineer @entity136 said : ‘ as we pursue our goal of making the world more open and connected , we have designed our service to show ads that help people discover products that are interesting to them			2
‘ we also recognise that our users trust us to protect the information they share on @entity0			2
‘ maintaining that trust is a top priority as we continue to grow			0

the changes mean that companies can track you down on @entity0 every time you buy something
measures have sparked calls for an official investigation by campaigners who claim that the public have not been properly notified
@entity0 claimed that there are safeguards attached to the new measures
