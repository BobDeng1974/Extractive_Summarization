heartbroken : @entity0 is fighting against the abortion law which left her no option but to give birth at 22 weeks to a baby girl who died just fifteen minutes later @entity6 ’s new abortion law forced one woman to give birth to her terminally ill , premature baby who she then helplessly held dying in her arms			1
@entity0 gave birth to one pound , ten ounce @entity11 last december and could do nothing but hold and comfort the baby with her husband , @entity14 , as the newborn struggled to breath and died fifteen agonizing minutes later			1
@entity0 rushed to hospital when her waters broke at only 22 weeks into the pregnancy but doctors told the couple that their baby had almost no chance of surviving			1
they explained that a lack of fluid would cause muscle tissues to shorten , affecting the baby 's developing lungs			0
they would likely never develop beyond the 22 - week point and the baby would not be able to breathe			2
with this heartbreaking information the couple decided to have an abortion to avoid the baby going through any pain			1
however a new law in @entity6 , the only one of its kind in @entity41 , bars abortion at 20 weeks except in specific situations when the mother ’s life is in immediate danger			1
the @entity47 did not qualify and were not allowed to have an abortion			0
instead they were sent home where they had to wait for ten days knowing that when their baby arrived she had no chance of surviving			1
after the days of waiting @entity0 gave birth to @entity11 and held her as she struggled for breath and died fifteen minutes later			1
now the couple , who had wanted a sibling for their son , are fighting against the law to try and prevent anyone going through the same ordeal			2
agony : banned from having an abortion the couple waited for ten agonizing days before @entity0 could give birth to their baby who they already knew would not survive the law , which took effect last october , is based on the disputed argument that a baby ’s nerves are developed enough to feel pain at the 20 week stage			1
in a letter urging governor @entity76 to veto the bill which which bans abortions after 20 weeks @entity0 , 34 , of @entity80 , described the pain of waiting to give birth to a baby she knew would die			1
' while we waited , we tried to pray , but we did n't know what to pray for			0
so we spent our days and nights telling our daughter how much we loved her , how sorry we were , and how we wished we could do something different			0
' there are no words for how awful the 10 days were from the moment my water broke to the day my daughter died			2
there are no words for the heart break that cut deeper every time she moved inside of me for those 10 days , ' she wrote			0
@entity100 , 34 , was pregnant with twins when her waters broke 18 weeks early			1
she was told her babies had a zero chance of survival and soon after lost her daughter @entity106			2
however , the mother from the @entity108 managed to delay giving birth to her son @entity110 for three weeks by lying with her feet elevated in a hospital bed			2
her precious son was born at just over 24weeks weighing a tiny 1lb - less than a bag of sugar			0
surgeons performed several operations on @entity110 including fixing a hole in his heart			0
six months later , @entity110 is healthy and showing no signs of his traumatic birth			0
the standard of viability , based on the @entity41 @entity125 ’s 1973 landmark decision in @entity126 , is generally considered to be between 22 and 24 weeks			2
' the outcome of my pregnancy , that choice was made by @entity131			0
i feel like how to handle the end of my pregnancy , that choice should have been mine , and it was n't because of a law , ' @entity0 told @entity135			1
and the couple believe that the new law does n’t take into account individual circumstances like their own			0
@entity140 , who heads @entity141 , believes the tragic outcome was still better than an abortion			0
' we acknowledge the tragedy that occurs with a poor prenatal diagnosis for the baby			0
but is n't it more humane for the baby to die in a loving manner with comfort care and in the arms of her parents than by the intentional painful death through abortion ? ' @entity0 believes that such a decision should belong to her and her husband			1
' it was very frustrating and added to our grief because the waiting compounded everything , ' she said .			0

@entity0 , 34 , wanted an abortion after doctors told her that her baby had no chance of surviving when her waters broke at 22 weeks
a new law in @entity6 which *dictates* that you can not have an abortion after 20 weeks meant @entity0 had no choice but to have her baby
with her husband , @entity14 , the couple waited ten days until she was able to give birth to baby @entity11
the couple *cradled* and comforted their baby for 15 minutes before she died
