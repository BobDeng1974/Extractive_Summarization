by @entity0 published : 19:15 est , 5 may 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 8 may 2013 the nation 's busiest roads could be resurfaced with rubber from used car tyres resulting in a quieter drive if you are driven to distraction by the noisy traffic outside your house , this could be the road to a good night ’s sleep			1
recycled car tyres could soon be used to surface roads across the country after a pioneering trial found they made roads quieter			1
one of the busiest roads in @entity20 was resurfaced last year with the asphalt , containing shredded rubber from old tyres			1
tests were performed on grip and skid resistance , with engineers reporting that the rubber road , on a stretch of dual carriageway between @entity31 and @entity32 , resulted in a quieter drive			2
the surface is also more environmentally friendly			2
since 2006 , @entity36 rules have banned the disposal of tyres in landfill sites , leaving about 480,000 tonnes of recyclable shredded rubber each year			1
experts claim the road requires less maintenance and still allows for drainage , while tyre recyclers claim the technique will also save money because the new material is thinner than standard roads			0
rubber roads were first built in the 1960s in the @entity52 , where today there are 20,000 miles of road made of recycled tyres			1
rubber roads are also popular in @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			2
the technique has been found to cut traffic noise by about 25 per cent			0
the asphalt is made by breaking down used tyres into rubber ‘ crumbs ’ which are added to bitumen and crushed stone , which are typically used to make asphalt			2
@entity36 rules have banned the disposal of tyres in landfill sites , leaving about 480,000 tonnes of recyclable shredded rubber each year experts say it makes roads quieter because the rubber thickens the bitumen – the binding agent which keeps the crushed stones together – allowing the road surface to trap and disperse sound waves			1
the rubber material is also springy and absorbs sound			0
reducing road noise could save lives			0
according to the @entity88 , around one heart attack in every 50 in @entity87 countries is caused by chronic exposure to loud traffic			0
it can also cause mental health problems and hormonal imbalances			0
a spokesman for @entity95 said : ‘ this adopts a sustainable approach in making the best use of resources available , by re-using an abundant waste material			0
