with a smile to melt the hardest heart , it ’s not surprising little @entity3 is taking the modelling world by storm			1
but what is amazing is @entity3 , 5 – who goes by the name of @entity8 – has @entity9			1
when she was born she almost died			1
her parents feared she might never learn to walk or talk properly			1
and aged two she battled with pneumonia and heart surgery			1
adorable model : @entity3 , 5 , was spotted by a photographer when on holiday in @entity16 yet she has now been signed up to model the clothes for two prestigious children ’s clothes companies			1
and as well as wowing the modelling world – other companies are also queuing up to feature @entity3 in their campaigns - she has started school and is learning to read			1
' when @entity8 was born we did n’t know if she would live , let alone if she would walk or talk properly			1
so this is a dream come true , ' said proud mum @entity26 42 , last night			2
' but everywhere we go people stop me to say what a gorgeous little girl @entity8 is			2
and she just adores being in front of the camera			2
' @entity36 company @entity34 agrees			2
' when we saw @entity3 ’s photos we were bowled over by how pretty she was , ' said spokeswoman @entity38 , ' and we think she will be perfect to model clothes for our 2012 @entity41 catalogue			1
' it ’s a world away from the day @entity3 – nicknamed @entity8 - was born			1
full - time mum @entity26 and her music company boss husband , @entity43 , 57 , from @entity44 , @entity45 , who also have another daughter , @entity47 , 7 , did not expect their second child would be born anything but healthy			1
' apart from some morning sickness , the pregnancy was totally normal , ' recalls @entity26 , who has had five miscarriages , ' a scan at three months did pick up an unusual thickness in @entity8 ’s neck and we were told this could be a sign of @entity9 ’s			2
but the chance of @entity8 being @entity60 was given as 300 to one , which was n’t enough to go for further tests such as an amnioscentesis			2
jumping for joy : @entity8 's enthusiasm is infectious and has turned her into a sought - after child model ' and as everything else was fine , we did n’t give it any further thoughts			2
' the couple even chose a home birth			2
' it was beautifully calm			2
i was in the bath and the midwives only arrived shortly before , ' says mrs @entity3			1
but as soon as @entity3 was born , alarm bells rang			1
' @entity8 was blue and not breathing			2
we knew something was terribly wrong when the midwife went into full emergency mode and gave @entity8 the kiss of life			2
' an ambulance was called and the pair were rushed to @entity88 ’s @entity87 hospital			2
there , as her mother lay in shock in a side room , medical staff desperately fought to save @entity3 ’s life			1
it was four hours later before a consultant came in and gave the couple the news their daughter was not only critically ill – but had @entity9			2
@entity26 said : ' when @entity8 was born we didn ¿ t know if she would live , let alone if she would walk or talk properly			1
so this is a dream come true ' ' his actual words were a blur , ' says mrs @entity3 , ' i was so stunned			1
@entity43 was fantastic – he immediately said , " well , she ’s our baby and we ’ll love her anyway , " and @entity47 adored her from the start			2
' it sounds awful now			0
but i did n’t even want to see her			0
it was such a nightmare - i just wanted to go home and forget i ’d had a baby			0
' things did n’t improve when she got to see @entity3			1
' i just looked at her in an incubator and thought , " you ’re not pretty			0
you do n’t even look like my baby "			0
i felt as if i ’d produced an alien			0
' doctors warned them @entity3 had two holes in her heart and the next few days would be critical			1
says mrs @entity3 : ' we even had @entity8 christened in hospital			1
' brave little girl : @entity8 tries out swimming with dolphins that night the couple went home			0
but it was when they returned the next morning that mum and daughter began to bond			0
' by then i wanted her to live			0
i suddenly looked at her , lying there amongst bleeping tubes and felt a rush of love			0
i longed for her to live			0
' thankfully after three weeks the couple were able to bring @entity3 home			1
' but no - one could tell us whether she would walk or even talk properly , ' says her mother , ' and she was constantly ill. we were in and out of hospital with pneumonia and she was constantly on antibiotics			0
gradually , however – and with intense physiotherapy to help strengthen her limbs – @entity3 grew stronger			1
' i ’ll never forget the day she first sat up by herself			0
she was ten months and that felt an amazing achievement			0
' sleeping beauty : the five - year - old takes a well - deserved nap after playing on the beach at a year @entity3 stunned everyone when she spoke her first word – @entity160			1
and at twenty months she took her first wobbly steps			0
age two she underwent heart surgery to seal the holes in her heart			1
and from then on she came on leaps and bounds			0
' she had so much energy and developed such a little personality			0
' then when @entity3 was four and the family were on holiday in @entity16 , they were approached by a photographer			1
' she was also on holiday and she asked if she could take some photos of @entity8			0
she was amazed at how photogenic @entity8 was			0
meanwhile , we could n’t believe how much @entity8 adored posing for the camera			0
' in september @entity3 reached another milestone the family never thought possible – she started mainstream school			1
welcome home ! @entity8 's mother , @entity26 , initially struggled to bond with her daughter , but big sister @entity47 ( pictured ) was always a fan at the same time @entity26 read about a boy with @entity9 in the @entity185 who is now a sought after model			0
' i decided to write to a couple of clothing companies with a snap of @entity8			0
i never thought anything would come of it			0
but incredibly both of them immediately emailed back inviting @entity8 to an audition			0
' @entity197 co-founder of children ’s organic clothing company @entity198 says : ' we immediately felt @entity8 had model potential and are now looking forward to featuring her in our next catalogue and online			0
' since then her proud mum has received interest from several other organisations – including holiday companies – requesting to see @entity3 for modelling work			1
she says : ' we are all so proud of @entity8			0
she does shine and it ’s wonderful that others see what we do in her			0

@entity3 almost died when she was born and had to have open heart surgery when she was two years old
