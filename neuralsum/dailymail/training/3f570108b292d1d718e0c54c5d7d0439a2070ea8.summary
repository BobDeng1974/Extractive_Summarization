by @entity0 published : 22:23 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 03:43 est , 25 july 2012 young people who use sunbeds almost double their risk of developing the most deadly form of skin cancer , warn researchers			1
the risk rises by 20 per cent for people using a sunbed at any stage in their lives , according to new estimates			1
as a result , tanning devices could be responsible for triggering malignant melanoma in more than 400 @entity16 each year - with 100 dying from the disease			1
warning : young people who use sunbeds almost double their risk of developing the most deadly form of skin cancer , researchers say a stark warning from @entity23 specialists about the perils of sunbed use comes after figures showed the number of over 50s suffering melanoma has tripled in 30 years			1
experts blame the rise of tanning salons and cheap holidays to the sun which boomed in the 1970s			0
the latest study , published in the @entity36 , says the toll from sunbed use is likely to increase as cancer takes several years to develop and young people fail to heed health warnings			2
dr @entity40 , of the @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , who led the study , said ' tougher actions ' were needed to get the message across			0
he said ' the burden of cancer attributable to sunbed use could further increase in the next 20 years because the recent , high usage levels observed in many countries have not yet achieved their full carcinogenic effects and because usage levels of teenagers and young adults remain high in many countries			2
' malignant melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer , with almost 13,000 @entity16 diagnosed in 2010			1
tragically , it is the fastest growing cancer in young people and the most common cancer in women in their 20s			0
@entity65 , which is linked to sun damage , is treatable if caught early but patients who develop metastatic disease - where the cancer has spread - are rarely cured with chemotherapy			0
just five per cent are still alive five years after diagnosis , with around 2,000 people dying each year			1
deadly : melanoma ( pictured ) is treatable if caught early but patients who develop metastatic disease - where the cancer has spread - are rarely cured with chemotherapy in the new study , researchers looked at data from 27 studies conducted between 1981 and 2012 involving 11,428 cases of melanoma			2
it showed the risk of developing the cancer increased by 20 per cent for those who had ever used an indoor tanning device with ultraviolet light			1
but the chances of developing melanoma shot up in those people who started using sunbeds before their 35th birthday - with the risk almost doubling			1
the study estimated the use of sunbeds leads to almost 3,500 cases of skin cancer and 800 deaths every year across @entity23			2
it suggested there were 444 cases and 99 deaths attributable to sunbed use in @entity16 - with the toll four times higher in women than men			1
the researchers pointed out that the dangers of indoor tanning have only recently been recognised			0
' powerful ultraviolet tanning units may be 10 - 15 times stronger than the midday sunlight on the @entity111 , and repeated exposure to large amounts of ultraviolet a delivered to the skin in relatively short periods ( typically 10 - 20 minutes ) constitutes a new experience for humans , ' said the study			2
the researchers called for tanning under the age of 18 to be restricted , and unsupervised tanning salons to be banned - laws that are already in place in @entity125 and several @entity23 countries			0
they accuse the sunbed industry of giving ' information intended to deceive consumers '			0
' the sunbed industry has used the opportunity to claim that properly regulated indoor tanning is safe , and that it might even have health benefits ' they said			0
in the @entity16 , scientists at the @entity136 say sunbeds should never be used by the under 18s			0
changes to the law in @entity141 mean those aged under 18 can not use tanning salons or sunbeds at commercial premises , and restrictions also apply in @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 .			0

tanning devices could be responsible for more than 400 cases of malignant melanoma in @entity16 each year
risk rises by 20 per cent for people who use a sunbed at any stage in their lives
