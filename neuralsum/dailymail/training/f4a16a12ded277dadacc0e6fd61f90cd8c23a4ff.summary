by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 09:37 est , 25 june 2012 multi-millionaire @entity1 , 64 , has shunned the high - life to be near his family and friends forget swimming pools and balconies , it 's a red - brick , semi-detached , council home in @entity11 that multi-millionaire couple @entity12 and @entity13 really want			1
it 's an unlikely choice , but @entity16 's most modest lottery winner and his wife have vowed to buy their beloved home of 30 years from the local council			1
down - to - earth @entity22 , 64 , is one of 12 bus drivers in @entity11 who sensationally scooped a massive £ 38million jackpot on the euromillions earlier this year			1
@entity12 , along with his wife @entity27 , 65 , a retired cleaner , were left overwhelmed by the win and sensibly chose to sit on their stash until they decided what to spend their fortune on			1
now the humble couple are patiently waiting for @entity11 to organise the deal , after being putting on a waiting list			1
incredibly , the winners have not even been on holiday to celebrate their lottery scoop and admitted to happily ‘ plodding along as before ’			2
the couple have shunned the idea of the ‘ highlife ’ and ‘ flash mansions ’ , instead happy to stay in their double - fronted , red - brick home to stay close to their family and neighbours			1
@entity27 , originally from @entity51 , said : ‘ we are still here at the moment			1
we have not moved on yet			2
we are still waiting to buy this place			2
‘ we told the council and have been waiting nine or ten weeks but they have not even been round yet to value the place			0
‘ they said there are so many other people applying to buy that we have to wait			0
we are just hoping they get back to us shortly			0
the @entity61 have shunned fancy mansions to buy their semi-detached council home , pictured on the left - hand side , in @entity11 ‘ we wo n’t be leaving @entity11 as all our close family are here			1
‘ we have not done much else really , @entity12 still has the same car , we ’ve not been anywhere - nothing has changed much , we are still just the same			1
‘ we are just plodding along as before - we are not worried about buying flash cars or flash mansions or anything like that			1
‘ we have not started living the millionaire life style and we never would it has not changed us a bit			2
you get some people who like to live the highlife but not us			0
’ the generous couple have already made surprise visits to family to share their winnings and plan to hand their current council house over to their granddaughter and her young son in the future			2
@entity27 who has three children , ten grandchildren and six great grandchildren added : ‘ we wo n’t be leaving @entity11 as all our close family are here			1
’ @entity90 heaped praise on the couple , proudly revealing their good fortune had n’t changed them at all			2
@entity96 , 64 , said : ‘ they ’re great neighbours , very kind , very considerate			0
‘ everyone gets along well and it ’s the kind of place where people really know their neighbours , we ’ve know them for 30 years			0
@entity1 , 64 , pictured second from right , was one of 12 bus drivers in @entity11 who sensationally scooped a massive £ 38million jackpot on the euromillions earlier this year ‘ they still shop in @entity111 , i still see them walking to the shops , there are no airs and graces			1
‘ they ’re just lovely people , i wish it were me but i ’m happy for them too			0
’ another neighbour said the @entity119 were really ‘ genuine ’ people			0
he said : ‘ with the kind of money they ’ve got now you ’d forgive people for thinking it was time to move on to bigger and better things			0
‘ you would n’t blame them if they wanted to zoom around in sports cars or buy a swimming pool but those two are n’t like that			0
‘ it ’s great to see they ’re in no rush to move away from their home and their friends no matter how much money they have			0
’ the bus drivers had all been part of the syndication for a number of years before they had the big win on friday , march 16			0
shockingly a former member of the group , single mum @entity147 , 36 , dropped out of the syndication shortly before the amazing win .			0

@entity22 and his wife @entity27 shun the ' high - life ' and ' flash mansions '
the couple still shops at @entity111
