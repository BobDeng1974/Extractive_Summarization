by @entity0 for @entity1 this is one fashion trend that even @entity3 would be too chicken to wear			2
two @entity7 - based artists , @entity8 and @entity9 , have created a gimp suit made entirely of raw chicken skins			1
the pair have now paraded their finished project called flesh around the streets of @entity15 , including visits to famous landmarks in the capital like @entity19 and @entity20			1
' afterwards , @entity23 also filmed an 80s - style aerobics video wearing the chicken suit			0
in an interview with @entity41 , the artist described the difficulty involved in making an gimp suit out of raw chicken skin			0
he said : ' originally i started using flesh at university , as more of a way to experiment with biodegradable matter			1
' it 's a little crass because obviously it 's a very direct approach to interpreting our environment but nonetheless something that i want to experience first hand			0
the chicken suit was extremely unpleasant to make			0
artist @entity8 said : ' it was really quite a horrible experience because just the feeling of piercing the flesh , you know it 's wrong ' @entity9 also wore the raw chicken suit to one of the capital 's most famous landmarks - @entity19 - which attracts thousands of visitors every day ' i envisaged using it like any other material but the reality is it does n't work quite in the same way because it 's flush , you ca n't help but respond emotionally yourself			1
' when i first did it , it was really quite a horrible experience because just the feeling of piercing the flesh , you know it 's wrong and you imagine it being alive and you doing that			0
'' the idea first originated from a much smaller project , where @entity8 and @entity23 made a teddy bear using the skins			1
from there , they decided to create a costume big enough for @entity23 to roam the streets of @entity15			0
as well as the live performance , the men have now created a line of products using the chicken skin print that includes flip flops , shower curtains , mugs , @entity96 covers , and baby dummies			1
big fans can even cover their whole home in chicken skin as there is also a range of chicken skin wallpaper , duvet covers and cushions			0
anyone who wants to try involved in the project will also be able to print out a chicken skin print from the artists ' website and pose up in a tourist location themselves for a photo , to try and make the picture go viral			2
