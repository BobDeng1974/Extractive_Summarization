@entity0 remains on course for his first experience of national service in rugby union at the end of this month , despite being ruled out of @entity7 ’s encounter with @entity8 on sunday			1
the @entity10 ’s 25 - year - old cross-code recruit from @entity11 was absent from the line - up announced on friday for the @entity13 pool 4 crunch at @entity14			0
his place at @entity16 has been taken by @entity19 centre @entity17 , who resumes his alliance with @entity21			1
there was no official explanation , but @entity24 understands that @entity0 suffered a minor leg injury in the final minutes of the victory over @entity27 a week ago			2
@entity0 ( left ) stretches his legs during his side 's victory at @entity31 last weekend burgess powers over for his first try for @entity7 as @entity35 's men romped to a 39 - 26 victory @entity0 is mobbed by his @entity7 team - mates after he touched down against @entity27 he was named man of the match following his try - scoring contribution in that fixture , so demotion seems unlikely			1
instead , it is thought that he has been rested by head coach @entity35 , in order to be fit for the home clash with @entity46 next weekend			2
both player and club are optimistic that this will be a one - week absence , and that will be welcome news for @entity53			0
the @entity19 head coach had long since decided that @entity0 will start at inside centre for the @entity56 against @entity57 in @entity58 on january 30			1
@entity53 has acclaimed the newcomer for his ‘ terrific ’ impact since switching from league and is understood to be determined to bring him into the national set - up at the earliest opportunity			0
@entity17 ( left ) will resume his centre partnership with @entity21 against @entity8 @entity53 was hoping to draft @entity0 into the @entity19 squad for the november internationals until the rugby league convert 's severe facial injuries suffered in the @entity70 delayed his start in union the @entity19 management had hoped to invite @entity0 into camp during the autumn campaign until his facial injuries in the @entity70 delayed his start in union			1
now , with the @entity56 appearance as the next stage of his rapid transition , the @entity78 is likely to be involved in test training before the end of the @entity84			1
a place in the expanded @entity87 training squad is inevitable , if he stays in one piece			0
while @entity53 will be relieved that @entity0 is not out for long , he will have growing concerns about @entity90			1
the @entity92 lock has n’t played since the @entity94 derby against @entity95 on december 20 and is not in the side to face the @entity97 on sunday			1
@entity90 is still suffering with an ankle problem and will not feature against the @entity97 on sunday saints have recalled captain @entity100 after his latest ban but @entity90 rolled his ankle in that showdown with the @entity95			2
his extended spell of inactivity is far from ideal for @entity19 , especially with @entity106 already ruled out of the @entity84			2
@entity107 and @entity27 engage in an all - @entity109 duel at @entity110 this evening , with @entity111 coming down to a three - way tussle for qualification also involving @entity114 , who visit the @entity116 next weekend			0
@entity117 is encouraged that his @entity27 team still have their destiny in their own hands			0
the director of rugby said : ‘ you do n’t need to be a mathematician to work out that if we win both , we ’re through			0
but it ’s not easy			0
