as the worst drought in decades continues to plague large swaths of the nation ’s breadbasket , a tale of archaeological intrigue has emerged to provide a silver lining			2

the town 's estimated 30 residents were forced to relocate as it was razed to the ground and flooded destroyed : how @entity12 used to look before its estimated 30 residents were forced to relocate as it was razed to the ground and flooded in 1965 the tiny town was established in the late 1870s and covered a mere 13 acres or so			1
but in 1965 @entity12 ’s estimated 30 residents were forced to relocate as it was razed to the ground and flooded			1
and now the waters have receded by more than 12 feet to reveal the foundations of long - ago demolished buildings , bricks from the old school house and dirt tracks			0
