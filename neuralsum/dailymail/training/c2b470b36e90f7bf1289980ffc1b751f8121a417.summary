click here for more from our brilliant @entity1 , including this map of @entity5 's dramatic winner for @entity6			1
if @entity6 's players really did rise as one against their coach during the half - time interval of their opening group encounter , one can only imagine how uncomfortable a scene it was in their dressing room after 45 minutes here			1
held by a determined , if rather negative , @entity17 , you have to wonder who got it in the neck this time			2
was it @entity5 for leading the calls for @entity23 to dump his 5 - 3 - 2 formation and switch to 4 - 3 - 3 ? or have the mutterings of dissent escalated into an all - out mutiny against the man in charge ? in the end @entity5 came to their rescue , breaking the deadlock of a bruising encounter with a quite brilliant 90th minute goal			1
but what a struggle a proved to get there , the evidence here suggesting that all is not well inside camp @entity6 if @entity5 's public criticism of @entity23 's tactics provides an accurate measure of the atmosphere			1
booked : @entity73 , @entity70 att : 57,698 referee : @entity80 ( @entity81 )			0
@entity82 : @entity51 ( @entity83 ) they were disjointed and defensively disorganised , at times a shadow of the team we expected to see take this @entity88 by storm			2
sunday is the anniversary of @entity92 's one - man demolition of @entity93 in @entity94 but the great man , here among the supporters yesterday , would not have been left convinced that another @entity88 can be won on this evidence			0
indeed , had it not been had it not been for some outstanding goalkeeping by @entity51 this could have been a repeat of @entity93 - @entity103 1950 , such were the opportunities @entity17 created			2
they were also incredibly defensive , but under the instruction of @entity108 they were a team simply conscious of their weaknesses and playing to their strengths			0
and they were fit too , @entity108 's success in persuading @entity17 to end their domestic season in april clearly proving a benefit			0
drama : @entity5 cuts inside and lets fly with a left - footed shot in the final seconds stunner : @entity17 's goalkeeper @entity120 is beaten by @entity5 's strike in injury time they might fallen to @entity5 's genius in the end but they deserve respect for making this the contest it was at a jumping @entity131			1
at times they were nothing short of heroic , even if they were n't always terribly easy on the eye			0
and while there might have been times when they appeared more interested in acquiring @entity5 's shirt – the captain had a crack before kick - off and four more players followed the @entity145 superstar off the field at half - time – they also displayed genuine ambition to try and progress beyond this group			1
for the tiny pocket of @entity17 fans - many of them here armed only with cash because international sanctions mean they ca n't access their bank accounts overseas – there was cause for excitement beyond the simple fact that their team was playing @entity5 and his international colleagues			1
there was a chance on goal for the side that battled to a goalless draw in their opening game against @entity170 , @entity67 meeting a free - kick with a header that flew wide			0
@entity49 and pain : @entity5 finally found a way through the red @entity17 wall in epic encounter but it did not take long for @entity6 to seize control of this game , with @entity57 – winning his 100th cap – and @entity56 very much in command in midfield			1
the fact that @entity17 did not concede sooner than they did owed much to the heroics of their goalkeeper , @entity120 denying @entity62 and @entity60 with two marvellous saves			0
but they were under so much pressure , their defence stretched in particular by the direct running of of the excellent @entity193			0
@entity5 , dropping deeper and deeper to get the ball , went close with a free - kick , while @entity54 really should have struck with the delivery @entity6 's number 10 then planted on his head			1
as it was his effort drifted hopelessly over the crossbar			0
it was becoming rather frustrating for @entity6 , and more than a little alarming when @entity67 threatened with another header			0
but it was as a defensive unit that @entity17 were impressing , even if such negative tactics must have gone against the instincts of a coach who used to stand alongside sir @entity208 every week			1
scare : @entity17 's @entity78 spurned a great chance to score when he directed his header at keeper @entity17 's @entity78 reacts after missing a chance to score close call : @entity17 's @entity70 and @entity76 appeal for penalty so close : @entity6 goalkeeper @entity51 tips @entity76 's haeder over the bar the sight of @entity60 throwing a corner flag to the ground at the sound of the half - time whistle summed up the mood of these @entity6 players			1
they had had 78 per cent of the ball in that opening 45 minutes – and completed 265 passes to @entity17 's 63 - but no real joy , @entity17 proving that talk of a 10 - 0 formation was not quite the joke they claimed it to be			2
that said , a rare counter attack early in the second half almost resulted in what would have been an astonishing goal for @entity17			0
a headline writer 's nightmare too			0
after a marvellous burst down the right flank @entity70 delivered a similarly impressive cross , only for @entity51 to produce an excellent save to stop @entity78 's close - range header			2
@entity5 would threaten from 20 yards in response but @entity17 would hit back with another couter - attack that demanded yet another save from @entity51 , this time to tip a goal - bound header from @entity76 over his crossbar			1
@entity251 would go close again , bursting clear only to see @entity51 deny him again			0
so it was left to @entity5 to finally produce the goal a game this enthralling deserved ; a classic @entity5 goal , driven low and at an angle from just outside the penalty area with that wonderful left foot .			2

@entity5 scored scored an injury - time winner to secure qualification for last *16*
@entity83 coach @entity23 had come under fire over his tactics
@entity76 went close for @entity17 with header which was tipped over the crossbar by keeper
@entity76 had strong claim for penalty after he was clipped by @entity52
