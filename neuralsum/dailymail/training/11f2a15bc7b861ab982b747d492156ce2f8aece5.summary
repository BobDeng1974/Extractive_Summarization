an inventive pet owner has created the world 's goldfish walking device , after worrying that his fish was becoming bored @entity15 spent thousands of hours designing his unique ' @entity6 ' as a way to help pet fish @entity8 have a more exciting life sadly , his beloved goldfish has since died , but he lived to the grand old age of 11 , thanks mr @entity5 says , to his adventurous lifestyle - which included trips to the pub and walks around town sadly , his beloved goldfish has since died			1
but the fish lived to the grand old age of 11 thanks , mr @entity5 says , to his adventurous lifestyle - which included trips to the pub and walks around town			0
despite @entity8 passing away he hopes his pioneering legacy will now see an entrepreneur come forward to invest in the invention			1
mr @entity5 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , said : ' we had some right looks around town , we stopped traffic , but everyone has got into it now			0
it 's not every day you see someone taking a fish for a walk			2
' if a fish is in a bowl on a shelf swimming in circles it must get bored			2
i decided it would be fun to take it out with me down the pub. ' people have said to me the fish could n't see what was going on , but i always said " how do you know ? " ' mr @entity5 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , said : ' we had some right looks around town , we stopped traffic , but everyone has got into it now			2
it 's not every day you see someone taking a fish for a walk ' the contraption even allows fish owners to share a drink at the local with their pet , as mr @entity5 enjoyed to do with the @entity8 he said : ' if a fish is in a bowl on a shelf swimming in circles it must get bored			1
i decided it would be fun to take it out with me down the pub ' ' @entity8 lived to almost 12 - years - old , i think he was getting something out of it			1
' the @entity6 - which is now a @entity84 - stands around four - foot tall and is made from laser - cut mild steel			1
mr @entity5 , who lives with wife @entity86 , 58 , said : ' my wife has learned to live with me , i have been tinkering around with this idea for around seven years			0
' with the first designs i did n't take into account how heavy water is so i have modified it over the years			0
' i 've added better elastic to take the shock out of the water and i hope to get better wheels			0
' because of my background as a sheet metal worker i have been able to build this at little cost - but for someone else it would cost hundreds to make			0
' i think i 'd like someone to come forward and help me motorise it perhaps with a remote control			0
