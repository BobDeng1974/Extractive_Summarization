from carpets that switch to wooden beams at the touch of a button , to floating beds and personal stylists built into mirrors – the bedroom of the future is set be a high - tech affair			1
experts predict that , within the next decade , we could also be sleeping on bedding with built - in cooling and heating systems , and surrounding ourselves with @entity15 printed ornaments			1
and for people who do n’t have a scenic view , smart windows could be used switch between rainforests scenes , valley views and even double up as projector screens			1
its predictions include carpets that switch to beams , floating beds and personal stylists built into mirrors @entity26 , the bedroom furniture firm , also details how many of these so - called futuristic concepts are already in the making , or available to buy			1
starting with a morning routine , @entity26 claims that mirrored glass on wardrobe doors will be superseded by virtual mirrors			1
in september , the @entity41 released its first international bedroom poll			2
it compared the amount of sleep and attitudes , habits and bedtime routines of people living across the @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			0
the results discovered that while a third of @entity52 prefer to sleep naked , @entity53 have to air their bedrooms weekly to achieve a good night 's sleep and half of both @entity54 and @entity49 take naps every two weeks to catch up on their shut eye			2
@entity62 has already developed a similar smart mirror prototype for the bathroom , and @entity26 believes they will become commonplace in bedrooms within five years			1
the intelligent interactive surface will not only display the contents of the wardrobe , but micro-tagged clothes could be tried on virtually using gestural technology			0
this means users can virtually swipe through choices , and see how items look when worn together			0
it could also be used as a personal stylist , helping people to decide what to wear depending on their diary entries , when linked with a smartphone , or the weather			0
users will also be able to shop online from these mirrors , to find shoes and accessories to match existing items			0
elsewhere in the futuristic bedroom concept , clear glass windows will be replaced with ‘ smart windows ’ , automated to the time of day and season , or personal preferences			1

on to the beds of the @entity125 next - generation mattresses and beds could use a cantilever mechanism to store the bed in the ceiling rather than a wall , according to @entity26			1
at the touch of a button , the bed could elevate up into a spot lit surround , and disappear into the ceiling			1
the bedding could be high - tech too			1
duvets of the future , for example , could be connected to body monitoring systems , telling sleepers to heat up if their body is getting too cold			1
to boost and monitor health , future bedrooms could be fitted with home automation systems linked to fitness tracking gadgets			1
the system would be able to optimise the heat and light to a person ’s exact needs			0
@entity153 ’s evohome ( pictured ) already lets users schedule , and personalise heating and hot water wirelessly this trend has also been seen recently with products such as @entity159 ( pictured ) - that controls everything from power sockets and light dimmers from smartphones - and @entity166 ’s ultra-thin film sensor , which connects wirelessly to a smartphone to provide sleep analytics and thanks to an in - built cooling system , this bedding will cool the body down to prevent night sweats			1
pillows could incorporate the same light technology used in lamps to combat light sensitivity , and could light up gradually as people wake			0
to boost and monitor health further , future bedrooms could be fitted with home automation systems linked to fitness tracking gadgets			2
the whole system would then be able to optimise the heat and light to suit a person ’s exact needs - even down to heart rate and core body temperature			0

and @entity153 ’s evohome lets users schedule , zone and personalise their heating and hot water wirelessly , using a touchscreen controller or an app. on the subject of fitness , @entity26 also predicts that bedrooms of the future will double up as gyms			1
homeowners will be able to elevate the bed to reveal a home gym , such as the @entity210			0
this box ( pictured ) contains a weight - lifting bar and selection of weights and a weight bench experts also predict that the flooring will be interchangeable at the flick of a switch			1
this means that carpets could be switched for laminate flooring at the touch of a button , and it could be cleaned using @entity226 ( pictured ) that can be set to clean whenever the owner wants energy - bills will be substantially less too , as lighting becomes more energy - efficient			1
in addition , self - iron fabrics could spell the end of ironing duvet covers			0

pillows could incorporate the same light technology used in lamps to combat light sensitivity , and could light up gradually as people wake			0
the @entity260 's simialr prediction is illustrated this means that carpet could be switched for laminate flooring at the touch of a button , and or graphics and patterns could be beamed onto the floor for parties , or for children to play on			2
