by @entity0 a former spokesman for @entity2 has come to her defense and said that in spite of her debts on the @entity8 side of her business , her fashion line was not in trouble at the time of her suicide			1
' her business overall was only seven years old and although some areas of the business had not yet reached their potential other parts of her business were proving successful , ' the unidentified spokesman told @entity18			2
@entity2 was found dead in her @entity20 apartment on monday and further investigation into her luxury fashion line 's finances showed that the @entity8 side of her business was thousands of pounds in debt , according to statements provided to @entity8 business regulator @entity28			1
on top of that , her close friend @entity44 wrote in a moving tribute to the 49 - year - old designer that she learned after @entity2 's suicide that she would be announcing the closure of her business this week			1
the unidentified spokesman said that the numbers were not reflective of the greater picture and she had been planning to rebrand in the coming months in keeping with larger goals			0
' in terms of figures shown at @entity28 in the @entity8			2
the parent company of @entity58 based in @entity39 had made a standard loan investment to the @entity8 subsidiary			1
@entity58 is fully able to meet the company ’s liabilities and pay all suppliers and customers , ' he told @entity18 on friday			0
' the fact that @entity2 would have been hounded by creditors or riddled with debt is preposterous			1
her wares : @entity2 walks after her fall 2012 show in @entity72 , but she had cancelled her recent show in @entity74 due to massive debts though at the time she blamed it on delayed fabrics small but selective : @entity2 's line was a favorite among celebrities like @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 who are seen with her at her 2008 show in @entity85 ' ms. @entity2 was considering a re-structure of her global business			1
' that said , he did not deny the accuracy of the @entity28 figures which showed the business was not profitable in the @entity8 , where she maintained a house and planned to show her collection at @entity96 before pulling out at the last minute - citing delayed fabric deliveries			1
the latest accounts for her business , filed in the @entity8 in october 2013 , show that the company , @entity101 , had a deficit of $ 5,899,548 ( 4,237,164 euros ) , with the designer owing creditors $ 7.641 million ( euros 5,488,125 )			1
however , in recent years , her company ’s debts increased on a yearly basis			0
in 2009 , the debt stood at $ 2,120,015.67 , and by 2010 it had grown to $ 3,063,160.87			0
she did not file any profit figure , but , because of @entity28 guidelines , she would have only been required to do so if the company made more than $ 10.8million ( £ 6.5million pounds )			0
designers are regularly paid between $ 20,000 and $ 1million for a collaboration with major fashion chains , and an industry source told @entity118 that @entity2 likely earned around $ 250,000 for her work with @entity120			2
support : @entity122 was by @entity2 's side as she unveiled her partnership with @entity120 in november , which reportedly earned her around $ 250,000 ms @entity44 , the @entity127 fashion critic and a friend of @entity2 's since the 1990s , wrote about how she worried about the toll that the stress from the company was taking on @entity2 , and because she had shut herself away in recent weeks , ms @entity44 was not fully aware of the extent of the trouble			1
' i sent her a text on march 12 , checking in			0
she did n’t reply , but that was n’t unusual			0
i learned since her death that she was planning to close her business , with an announcement this week			1
still , as painful as the decision must have been for her , i would n’t draw any conclusions from it about her state of mind , ' ms @entity44 wrote in @entity144			0
' like many small designers , she had problems managing her business : cash flow , finding the right managers , getting her goods out of @entity151 factories on schedule			0
' back on home turf : the @entity155 plane first landed in @entity156 and has now been spotted in @entity157 ( pictured ) on friday home : @entity159 was the only main band member seen disembarking in @entity157 and @entity122 was last known to be in @entity156 with his children though her close friends were concerned that she had been pushing them away in recent months , many outsiders were surprised that money troubles would be one of the factors in her suicide particularly since she was the longterm partner of millionaire @entity169 frontman @entity122			2
she and the rocker had been dating since 2001 when she was working as a stylist and they met on the set of a photo shoot			0
he was in @entity176 as the band was due to play seven shows on their ' 14 @entity180 ' tour when he learned the news of her death			0
' i am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way , ' he said in a statement released on his website tuesday .			2

unnamed spokesman has said that while her company was in debt in the @entity8 it was just one portion of her business
' ms @entity2 was considering a re-structure of her global business , ' he said
@entity2 was found dead in her @entity85 apartment on monday
a close friend revealed earlier this week that she found out after @entity2 's death that the designer planned to announce the end of her fashion line
