by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 21:21 est , 19 december 2013 @entity3 : 23:33 est , 19 december 2013 new study results out of the @entity5 say that the higher your levels of anxiety , the more likely you are to suffer a stroke			1
the long - term research looked at over 6,000 patients starting in the mid- 1970s			2
their evidence suggests that even moderately increased anxiety can increase chances of the potentially deadly or debilitating ailment			0
cause for concern ? a study that followed 6,000 people beginning in the 1970s has concluded that anxiety is a serious risk factor for stroke the top worst 33 percent of anxiety sufferers were found to have a whopping one - third higher chance of having a stroke than those with the least amount of anxiety			1
the study was led by @entity29 , whose team collected data on participants aged 25 to 74			0
they filled out questionnaires and were given tests to determine their levels of anxiety and depression			0
for decades thereafter , researchers kept track of the strokes experienced by the thousands of participants			0
could it happen to me ? the worst third of anxiety sufferers in the study were 33 percent more likely to suffer a stroke than the least anxious third of participants they discovered that , other risk factors like smoking and high blood pressure aside , anxiety was its own major contributing risk factor to stroke			2
‘ everyone has some anxiety now and then			0
but when it 's elevated and / or chronic , it may have an effect on your vasculature [ blood vessel system ] years down the road , ’ @entity29 said			0
@entity66 noted that risk factors like smoking — which people with anxiety tend to more commonly do — were more likely to lead to stroke than anxiety alone			2
but @entity29 and her team said that the direct biological effects should be considered when assessing risk and seeking to prevent stroke			1
‘ given anxiety is highly prevalent in the population , our findings suggest that assessing anxiety symptoms may contribute to developing more effective preventive and intervention strategies for reducing stroke risk , ’ the study concluded			1
preventable ? the researchers concluded that the direct biological effects of anxiety should be used in helping assess risk for and ways to prevent stroke			1

the @entity5 study gathered data on 6,000 people starting in the 1970s
it found that even modest increases in anxiety were linked to increased risk of stroke
the study 's *author* 's hope their research can be used to develop effective ways to help prevent stroke
