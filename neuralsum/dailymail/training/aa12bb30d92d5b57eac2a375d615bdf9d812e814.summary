by @entity1 reporter published : 10:08 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 10:16 est , 29 august 2012 @entity3 's @entity2 has promised to wage war on unemployment the @entity3 government is offering to pay most of the salaries of tens of thousands of young people hired next year , as part of president @entity2 's promise to wage war on unemployment			1
@entity3 's unemployment rate is 10 per cent , but 22.8 per cent for those under 25 - an imbalance that many @entity17 countries are struggling with			1
@entity3 employers are especially reluctant to hire young people because restrictive labour laws make it very hard for companies to lay off employees			1
in addition , many industries require a series of often unpaid internships before landing a full - time job or only offer very short - term contracts for those just starting out			2
under the plan , unveiled at a cabinet meeting wednesday , companies that hire a person between 16 and 25 for at least a year will only have to pay as little as 25 per cent of the salary			1
the government hopes to create 100,000 of these ' contracts for the future ' next year and another 50,000 in 2014			1
it has promised to continue paying its share of the employee 's salary for three years			0
' we are waging a battle for jobs , ' @entity2 told cabinet ministers , according to government spokeswoman @entity46			2
' it 's the no. 1 challenge of our mandate			0
' the government will give preference to young people hired from poor urban or rural areas that have been hit hardest by rising unemployment			1
attempts by previous governments to tackle surging youth unemployment have sparked protests like the one pictured above in @entity58 in 2006 certain sectors will also be favoured , such as medicine and digital or green technology			2
the proposal needs to make its way through parliament , but @entity2 's @entity65 has a solid majority there and the issue was a major campaign promise			0
@entity2 has staked his credibility on driving down unemployment and encouraging growth , all while meeting strict budget deficit targets			0
it 's unclear whether he can manage all three - especially since the economy 's fate is largely tied up with @entity17 's wider debt crisis and the wellbeing of its neighbours			0
an entrepreneur 's association immediately panned the idea			0
' the jobs for the future are only a @entity85 , if a necessary @entity85 , in the face of a government that every day shows itself more incapable of overcoming the difficulties our country is confronted with , ' said @entity91 , president of the @entity92 and ceo of strategy consultancy @entity94			1
' how can they not see that this cost is extremely high for the government , even while we should be reducing our deficit ? ' the government estimates that the programme will cost 2.3 billion euros ( Â£ 1.8 billion ) next year			0
while @entity3 has so far dodged investor concerns that have driven borrowing costs high in @entity104 and @entity105 , many economists say its day is coming			2
while the sheer size of its economy - the eurozone 's second - largest - has insulated it , they insist that its declining competitiveness will eventually force it to make the kinds of tough reforms its neighbours are facing .			0

@entity3 *premier* vows to *reverse* 10 *%* unemployment
young people face worst of crisis with nearly one in four out of work
' contracts for the future ' will see government pay up to three *quarters* of salaries for those aged 16 to 25
