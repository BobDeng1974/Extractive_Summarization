a group of 12 pits recently excavated in @entity10 appear to mimic and align with the phases of the moon , making it possible to track lunar months over the course of a year			1
researchers from the @entity17 now believe that the monument dates back 10,000 years - predating the earliest known calendar by 5,000 years			1
a group of 12 pits recently excavated in @entity10 appear to mimic the phases of the moon to track lunar months over the course of a year			1
researchers from the @entity17 now believe this monument could be the world 's oldest ' calendar ' and dates back 10,000 years a @entity25 calendar was recently uncovered inside a vast city built by the ancient civilisation near @entity28			1
one wall of the calendar was covered in calculations that appeared to relate to the @entity25 calendar			0
it featured a line - up of men in black uniforms and the astrological calculations are not fully understood			0
archaeologists from @entity37 believe the dates stretch up to 7,000 years into the future and contradicted the ' doomsday ' predictions about 2012			0
the first formal time - measuring devices were thought to have been created in @entity43 about 5,000 years ago			1
the pit alignment near @entity46 predates those discoveries by thousands of years , experts say			1
the @entity49 monument at @entity50 is said to have been created by hunter - gatherer societies nearly 10,000 years ago			1
it was excavated between 2004 and 2006 and was recently analysed by researchers from the @entity17			0
they found that the monument pits align during the midwinter sunrise , which researchers say would provide an annual ' astronomic correction ' to maintain the link between the passage of time indicated by the moon , the solar year and the seasons			2
the project was led by @entity64 , professor of landscape archaeology at the @entity17			0
this is an artist 's impression from the @entity17 of a fire burning in one of the lunar calendar pits at @entity50 from around 8,000 @entity70 , in @entity46 , @entity10 he said : ' the evidence suggests that hunter - gatherer societies in @entity7 had both the need and sophistication to track time across the years , to correct for seasonal drift of the lunar year and that this occurred nearly 5,000 years before the first formal calendars known in the near east			1
@entity17 professor @entity64 , pictured , stands in front of the 10,000 - year - old excavated lunar pits ' in doing so , this illustrates one important step towards the formal construction of time and therefore history itself			2
' dr @entity88 from the @entity89 , was also involved in the project and said the pit monument provided new evidence of the ' sophistication ' of societies in early @entity7			0
' this is the earliest example of such a structure and there is no known comparable site in @entity99 or @entity100 for several thousands of years after the monument at @entity102 was constructed , ' he said			2
the pit site was first discovered when unusual crop markings were noticed during an aerial survey by the @entity106			0
it lies on the @entity108 for @entity7 's @entity46 estate and was excavated by the trust and @entity111			2
dr @entity112 , the trust 's archaeologist for eastern @entity7 , said : ' this is a remarkable monument which is so far unique in @entity99			0
' our excavations revealed a fascinating glimpse into the cultural lives of people some 10,000 years ago - and now this latest discovery further enriches our understanding of their relationship with time and the heavens			0
' the research was published in the journal @entity127 .			0

the monument is made up of 12 pits that appear to mimic moon phases
this would have made it possible for *residents* to track lunar months
it was discovered in @entity50 near @entity46 in @entity10
the discovery predates the earliest known calendar by 5,000 years
