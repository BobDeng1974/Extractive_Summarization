from @entity0 and @entity1 to @entity2 , celebrity yoga selfies have become as commonplace as controversial tweets and paparazzi upskirt shots			1
but this new cultural stalwart is drawing ire from the yoga community , which claims that these celebrity yoga snaps are nothing more than a publicity stunt and do little to promote the ideals of the ancient practice			1
@entity13 , a @entity14 - based yogi who runs a site called @entity16 , told the @entity17 : ‘ in a sense it mocks what yoga is			1
’ dangerous message ? @entity2 posted this controversial image on @entity22 on friday afternoon , writing : ' my intention is to promote health and encourage you to care for your body			2
# yogapostureoftheday ' supermodel devotee : the fastest yoga participation growth period in the @entity31 was between 2008 and 2013 , which saw a 29per cent increase , and today , an estimated 20.4 @entity31 practice yoga			0
@entity35 , @entity1 one of the most prolific celebrities to post selfies in complicated poses is @entity2			0
the 29 - year - old worked as an instructor for the @entity14 - based studio @entity41 before exchanging community classes for a marriage to actor @entity44			1
but that has n’t stopped the pint - sized mother - of - one from continuing her practice in public			0
in fact , her ‘ 365 days of @entity58 ’ campaign – a series of @entity52 showing her posing in awkward locations such as the aisle of a plane – has helped cement her status as a yoga personality			2
these images , which routinely accrue thousands of ‘ likes ’ on her @entity22 account , have been called out by more serious practitioners for subverting the original intentions of a yoga practice : humility , privacy , and a search for the truest self			0
in posting a photo and inadvertently seeking followers ’ fanfare , the likes of ms @entity13 believe that celebrities negate yoga ’s original purpose			1
real deal : supermodel @entity0 ( pictured ) has practiced yoga since she was a teenager @entity81 : ms @entity0 , a serious yogi , makes this backbend look easy - but it is surely not striking controvery : @entity2 's shalabhasana is one of the many celebrity yoga pose photos to draw ire from the yoga community mrs @entity2 has spoken out in defence of her yoga photos , arguing that such ' harsh judgments ' make for the most un-yogic behavior possible			1
she wrote on @entity94 : ' true yogis dont make harsh judgements			0
so my advice to the haters : get on your yoga mat & breath & feel , until you make peace with diversity			0
[ sic ] ' mrs @entity2 , however , is not alone in fielding criticism from the yoga community			0
taking flight : @entity108 ( pictured ) is a serious yogi too and is pictured here in an acroyoga position balanced approach : yoga , as demonstrated by @entity108 here , takes careful instruction and coaxing into positions photos from supermodel @entity1 ’s @entity22 account often show the leggy @entity123 striking an asana by the beach , by the pool , or in her at - home yoga studio alongside one - year - old daughter @entity124			1
but they too , have received little love			0
‘ the discussion has been evolving over time since @entity22 began , ’ ms @entity13 says			2
‘ there ’s a sentiment [ among the yoga community ] that they ’re doing a disservice to yoga by putting these pictures out there			0
it ’s showy and basically everything that the practice is not supposed to be about — “ look at me and these awesome poses i can do ! ” ’ potential for injury : yogis worry that fans of celebrities like @entity144 ( pictured ) may feel prompted to strike an urdhva dhanurasana like hers without proper training - which could lead to injury stairway to enlightenment ? some experts say that @entity2 's @entity22 yoga poses are nothing more than a publicity stunt unreal bodies : yoga selfies , like this one from @entity157 , are being accused by some as promoting anti yogic principles but even more detrimental , according to yoga critics , is how celebrity images – especially those depicting especially advanced poses – have the potential to lead to fan injury			1
‘ i worry about people getting hurt because they think , “ i want to get into that pose , ” ’ @entity169 , the lead teacher trainer at @entity14 ’s @entity170 .			2

@entity13 , a @entity14 - based yogi says celebrity yoga photos on *social* media ‘ mock what yoga is ’
