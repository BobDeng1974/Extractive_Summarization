some people melt when they see babies or small kittens			2
for me , it ’s chairs			2
i find myself stroking them longingly at parties ( you do get some odd looks )			2
whenever i pass a sofa or an armchair , i dream of flopping down with a cup of tea or sprawling across it with my shoes off			2
instead , i march on past , gritting my teeth , as i stay standing			1
my name is @entity20 and i ’ve spent the last month mostly standing up			1
seats on the train or bus are banned			2
i ’ve conducted meetings and phone calls standing up			1
i ’ve taken to typing vertically and learned to book ‘ standing room only ’ tickets at the theatre			1
i ’ve even watched tv balancing on one leg			0
beware the chair : @entity20 tried standing up more often to see if she could lose weight the reason for all this time spent upright ? @entity36 ’ new pound - shedding plan			1
as well as the usual advice on diet and exercise , they now advocate you simply stand up more to lose weight			1
according to the company ’s latest research , 67 per cent of us are off our feet , either seated or lying down , for an astonishing 20 hours a day			1
we watch more tv than ever , an average of four hours and two minutes a day			1
and yet we kid ourselves that we lead busy , active lives			0
dr @entity51 , professor of @entity52 at @entity53 , who is backing @entity36 ’ campaign , says : ‘ even if you exercise for at least 30 minutes most days , you are still storing up health problems from being sedentary too much			1
the message is clear - move more and sit less ! ’ he has come up with a list of small changes you can make to incorporate sitting less into daily life - from using your smartphone while standing up , to placing your computer on an ironing board and even moving your bin away from your desk , forcing you to stand up to use it			1
tall order : @entity20 tried balancing her laptop on an ironing board and books so she could stand while working he says you should water the garden using a watering can rather than a hosepipe			1
if there are just a few dirty plates after dinner , stand and wash them at the sink rather than loading the dishwasher and flopping on the sofa			1
convenience is the enemy of calories			0
@entity36 suggests you squeeze the muscles in your bottom repeatedly as you brush your teeth			1
' i hate the idea that something so innocent as sitting down is actually doing irreparable damage to my health ' simply by standing and walking for five minutes in every 30 of an eight - hour working day - an hour and 20 minutes a day - dr @entity51 say an average adult could burn over 2,500 calories over one month			1
that ’s a third of a stone			0
‘ of course , more physical activity and healthy eating will also help a great deal , but small changes , like standing and moving every half hour , can be an important part of weight control , ’ he adds			1
‘ the change will be slow and gradual			0
if we move more while standing , the benefits will be greater			1
’ a third of a stone just for standing up for a bit ? i resolved to see what would happen if i stood up for three hours every day for a month			1
on the first day , i had to take a rush - hour train to a meeting			1
standing up was tough , and i had to go against all of my commuter instincts when i spotted the perfect seat			1
but i clung on for 30 minutes , distracting myself with a gripping novel			0
result : after a month of standing up more she lost half a stone @entity120 was another test as i wandered around an art gallery , without stopping for a coffee , followed by an hour ’s window shopping and a stroll across the park to meet friends			2
my calves began to feel tight , my back ached ( memo to self : keep your handbag light or you end up lopsided )			0
but i found that by walking through the pain i did actually feel more energised			0
by the evening , i did n’t want to sit down on the train , even as a treat			0
back at home , i watched an episode of @entity140 , standing upright			2
it felt most peculiar , but i noticed i concentrated on the programme much more than normal			0
sitting down clearly makes my brain sluggish , as well as my muscles			0
frankly it was a relief to go to bed - lying down , what a hedonistic joy			2
sitting targets women are 40 per cent more likely to die early if they sit for six hours a day than if they sit for three the next day i got stuck into working while upright			1
@entity36 advises you to do some stretching or star jumps every half hour to kickstart your metabolism			1
the star jump and i will never be friends , but i did try typing an article while standing up			2
my desk proved too far away from my arms , so i repositioned the laptop on the ironing board , balanced on a pile of books			0
but i ’m so damn shortsighted that i still i could n’t see the keyboard properly and felt like @entity162 mangling the piano			0
@entity166 typing was difficult , making phonecalls was a winner			0
i focused more on the conversation and it made me feel authoritative			0
i did my best to remain chairless when i went in for catch - up meetings with editors , leaning against their desk rather than flopping down gratefully			2
and it is rather productive , with all business conducted in under ten minutes			0
i ’m not surprised to hear that @entity178 companies favour this style over long , sit - down conferences where people get too comfortable			2
bottoms down : we spend too many hours a day being sedentary as the month went on , i began carving away the time i usually spend on my generous @entity185 bottom			1
and i discovered that going for dinner was still possible thanks to my new love affair with restaurants where you stand up to eat at the counter , from @entity193 noodle bars to espresso counters			2
the only pain is you eat and leave , rather than lingering for a leisurely feast with friends			0
standing up can be socially awkward , too , as it does rather unnerve other people			2
female friends would say : ‘ for heaven ’s sake sit down , @entity20 , it ’s not comfortable to have you towering over me			0
’ but after a month of staying on my feet for three hours a day , i ’ve lost half a stone			1
and , yes , i was still eating cheese and drinking wine			0
i ’ve bought a new pair of ( size 14 ) trousers for the first time in ten years			0
my legs and stomach are more toned			0
i get up from the sofa without making that strange ‘ @entity218 ’ noise			0
i feel more capable and energised			0
though i know i will never be able to stand up all day , every day ( i ’m still working up the courage to ask for a blow - dry standing up ; i ’m 5ft 8in , will they ask an energetic young stylist to climb a stepladder ? ) i ’m going to try to stay on my feet as much as possible			1
i hate the idea that something so innocent as sitting down is actually doing irreparable damage to my health			0
‘ those who sit a lot tend to have a higher risk of lifestyle diseases , including diabetes , regardless of how much exercise you do , ’ warns dr @entity51			0
i do still have dreadful chair lust at parties , though			0
so do n’t be surprised if you come across me , standing alone like a wallflower , fondling a nicely - upholstered @entity240 .			1
