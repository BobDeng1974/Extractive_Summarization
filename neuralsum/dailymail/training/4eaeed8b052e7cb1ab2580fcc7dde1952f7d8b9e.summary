read @entity1 's report from @entity2 to pull on the @entity4 shirt , to wear those @entity4 on the left breast , is the biggest honour in the game			1
@entity8 away or @entity9 at home : every cap for your country counts			0
so what , if anything , fried @entity17 ’s brain after he played just 45 minutes of @entity4 ’s thumping 5 - 0 victory over @entity19 at @entity20 on thursday evening ? @entity17 warms up during the first half of @entity4 's 1 - 0 win over @entity8 in @entity2 @entity17 ( centre ) in better spirits on the bench but the fact he felt he could n't start was a worry @entity17 chats to @entity28 as the pair warm up before the match at @entity31 of the players @entity4 used against @entity8 , only @entity32 has played more minutes this season than @entity17 ... @entity32 1164 minutes played @entity17 1079 mins @entity35 1064 mins @entity36 1035 mins @entity37 995 mins @entity38 990 mins @entity39 990 mins @entity40 919 mins @entity41 836 mins @entity42 758 mins @entity43 741 mins @entity44 538 mins we must remember @entity17 is 19			1
to kill this kid for pulling out of an international match is dangerous territory			0
far better to look into the real reasons why a player @entity50 regards as the brightest talent in @entity53 football has opted out of a @entity55 qualifier in @entity2			0
if @entity17 really approached @entity50 at @entity57 on saturday morning to ask not to play , then there is a deeper , wider psychological issue in our game			1
it would be remiss of club and country if they do n't provide whatever emotional support he needs			0
‘ @entity17 is a teenager , ’ tweeted @entity65			1
‘ teenagers do get tired and even moody			0
he 's young , still developing , we should cut him some slack			0
’ @entity69 is right , but @entity4 must immediately start searching for the reasons why a player would pull out of the starting line - up more than 24 hours before kick - off			1
take @entity74 , for example			0
at the same age as @entity17 is now , the @entity9 forward had commercial contracts with 11 different companies from tvs to sportswear to banks ( to look after all that money )			1
@entity17 was finally introduced after 64 minutes , coming on for his @entity84 club mate @entity36 the @entity85 was set up to handle it all			1
so why ca n’t @entity17 , if @entity50 ’s analysis is to be taken at face value , hack it ? every player is different and @entity50 ’s version is that @entity17 , who has scored three times in the @entity93 for @entity84 , was not mentally ready to face @entity8			2
‘ he told me so , ’ revealed the @entity4 manager			2
so if the relationship really is that strong , why did n’t @entity50 offers some words of encouragement when he sent for @entity17 to save this game after 64 minutes			1
@entity4 ’s head coach turned to his assistant @entity100 to call ‘ @entity104 ’ back from the corner flag when he was warming up in an orange bib midway through the second half			2
then he left it to @entity106 to have a few words with the @entity84 forward when @entity17 swapped his red base layer for the red no 19 shirt of @entity4			1
the 19 - year - old immediately got on the ball and tried to make things happen for @entity4 @entity17 came on and made an impression , but the expectation of the youngster is high as he waited in the technical area for the ball to go out of play , @entity4 ’s goalkeeper coach @entity116 was sent out with a tactics folder to show @entity17 the positions he should take up at set - pieces			1
there was barely any advice , or a word exchanged , with @entity50			0
inevitably then it was the @entity84 forward , the man too tired to train at @entity57 on saturday morning , who won the free - kick for @entity4 on the edge of the @entity8 penalty area			2
he replaced @entity36 , racing around the pitch like a puppy chasing falling leaves			2
he looked anything but tired or fatigued , mentally or physically			0
@entity17 raises expectations when he is on the ball , perking up @entity4 ’s supporters with those step overs , the double - tap touch he relies on to beat his opponents and then pacey , twisting runs			1
@entity17 raises expectations when he gets the ball and perks up the support , despite starting on the bench eventually one of them , when it first appeared that he was about to take on one man too many , that he won the 73rd minute free - kick			1
@entity42 scored and @entity4 maintained their 100 per cent record in @entity151 after victories against @entity8 , @entity153 and @entity19 in this @entity55 qualification campaign			2
so what of the intriguing sub-plot , the story that emerged after @entity4 ’s head coach clumsily revealed in a television interview before the game that @entity17 told him he was too tired to finish a training session ? at 19 , this is highly unusual behaviour			1
on sunday he was made to wait his turn , sitting on the bench alongside @entity4 ’s substitute keepers @entity165 and @entity167 until @entity50 twitched			2
@entity17 is brought down on the edge of the box by @entity170 ( right ) - and @entity42 scored the free - kick @entity172 ( left ) attempts to catch up with @entity17 in the second - half in @entity2 sat there in his tracksuit bottoms , just below pitch level alongside the assorted coaching staff , medics and substitutes , @entity17 looked remote and removed			1
think back to @entity50 ’s verdict on the @entity84 forward in a corridor at @entity20 on thursday in the minutes that followed the 5 - 0 thumping of @entity19			0
it was there that @entity50 admitted there would come a time when he would have to manage expectations around @entity17			0
that moment has arrived sooner than @entity4 ’s head coach expected			0
@entity17 had been on the field for nine minutes , looking like a puppy chasing falling leaves as he hoovered up the ground in search of @entity4 ’s winner			1
@entity17 , who was like a ' puppy chasing fallen leaves ' when he come on , motors past two @entity199 he made the difference when he came on , lulling @entity8 ’s defence into the foul on the edge of the penalty area that led to @entity42 scoring direct from the resulting free - kick			0
he made the difference , but these are delicate times for @entity17 and it will be down to @entity209 to realign him in the coming days			0
this is about a kid , a young player at the highest level of the game , crying out for help			0
club and country should make sure he gets it .			0

@entity17 said he wanted to be left out of @entity4 's starting xi
there could be a deeper psychological issue at play
@entity17 came on for @entity36 after 64 minutes
