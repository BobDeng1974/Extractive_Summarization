had enough of extravagant holidays ? tired of five - star suites , three - hundred thread count sheets and room service ? then why not stay in a hovel ? or , to be precise , a half - completed treehouse with no bathroom facilities for £ 11 a night			2
the latest holiday accommodation craze comes courtesy of @entity10 , a website which specialises in ‘ anti-luxury ’ holiday rooms for travellers on a shoestring budget			1
@entity16 : the 18 ' yurt , which costs £ 15 a night , is surrounded by a fenced courtyard and advertised as an ' extremely relaxing retreat for one or more persons			0
' @entity21 in @entity22 : this hobbit-esque hovel will set travellers back £ 45 a night and is registered as hurricane - proof on the website but not every traveller can take advantage of the rock bottom rates as bookings are only accepted from those enrolled in college or university and have a valid student @entity35 card			1
the recently launched website , based in @entity38 , was set up by three friends who wanted to offer college students inexpensive travel digs			1
and the rather unusual approach seems to have taken off as , according to reports , the site has secured more than £ 700,000 ( $ 1.2m ) funding from investors in @entity47 and @entity48			0
the £ 11 a night @entity49 in @entity50 offers ' incredible views of the neighbouring yards			0
' there are no loo facilities though and would - be renters are advised to use the nearby @entity57 station the £ 15 a night yurt ( left ) comes with two camp bed			2
the website also offers the chance to hang out out in a covered patio in a @entity64 hammock for £ 12 a night guests can book to stay in @entity66 - a tiny hut in a volcanic crater on the property of the @entity70 and costs £ 18 a night ‘ we really wanted to be the anti-luxury vacation rental site , ’ @entity72 , ceo and co-founder of hovelstay.com said			1
‘ two of us who had years in the vacation rental business were always floored at how serious a lot of these vacation rental sites took their properties , describing the , as luxury when in fact they were n’t			2
’ all rooms listed on the site are priced at less than £ 60 ( $ 99 ) and students can reserve them for a night , a week or a semester			2
@entity16 : the 18 '' yurt boasts two hammocks and it 's very own hut			0
all for £ 15 a night inside the £ 18 a night @entity91 retreat which boasts two camp beds and is perfect for those travelling on a budget a two - storey house in @entity97 city @entity96 is located in a ' safe neighbourhood ' and cost £ 7 a night the site offers three different groups of living quarters : @entity102 – ‘ as close as staying in your own room when visiting home as you can get ’ ; @entity107 – ‘ spring break ( ish ) accommodations , usually in a really good neighbourhood ; and @entity111 – ‘ for the thrillseeker			2
’ ‘ so we decided on the approach of full disclosure – if it ’s a dump , we would love to have it , and students are in on this kind of experience			1
it ’s not just where you stay , it ’s what happens when you stay there			0
‘ the same experience as when you backpack through @entity127 during a summer break – when you ’re willing to sleep on a bale of hay inside of a barn in @entity132 to save money			0
that ’s what we are selling			0
the lovely @entity136 property on the summit of @entity138 is located at the @entity139 and surrounded by organic herb and botanical gardens			0
it will cost students £ 33 a night to stay there the 3,000sq ft @entity145 was built from three shipping containers and is connected to a 90 - acre nature reserve			1
a bargain at £ 3 a night each shipping container room of the @entity145 is furnished with two single beds and minimal storage space ‘ but , to be on the safe side , we do have some cool luxury listings , too			1
the primitive properties on the site range from a tiny two - bed hut in a volcanic crater in @entity159 at £ 18 ( $ 30 ) a night , a @entity160 in @entity161 for £ 59 ( $ 99 ) a night and a £ 12 ( $ 20 ) a night hammock on someone ’s back patio			1
' luxury listings ' include the @entity166 £ 18 ( $ 30 ) , parked in @entity159 , the £ 33 ( $ 55 ) a night @entity167 on @entity138 and a palatial boat , docked in @entity169 at £ 30 ( $ 50 ) a night .			0
