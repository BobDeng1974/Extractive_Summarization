five o'clock shadow across a lantern jaw			2
a hint of fresh sweat ? check			2
the current crop of male leads smouldering all over our television screens are rocking a ' pretty but gritty ' look that makes @entity11 's erstwhile mr @entity10 look positively hygienic			1
shows such as @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 are dressing up their key actors in breeches , leather and chain metal and asking them to get down and dirty for their art , much to the delight of watching female fans			1
battle of the breeches ! actor @entity24 ( left ) , clad in leather , plays @entity25 in the hit @entity27 fantasy series @entity16 and the dimly - lit period setting - think candlelight and flaming torches - only serves to accentuate the mean and moody looks			1
@entity31 is leading the way as captain @entity13 in the @entity33 's much talked - about sunday night offering			1
so enthralled are the viewing public by the @entity38 actor 's good looks and rippling physique - which he shows off in plenty of topless scenes - that several @entity42 handles have been dedicated to parts of @entity13 's anatomy			2
ongoing @entity27 success , @entity16 has caused a similar loin - stirring frenzy among those watching with characters such as @entity25 and @entity50 perfecting the tender but rugged look			1
time travel drama , @entity15 , based on the books by @entity55 , flings main character @entity56 into the arms of 18th century @entity59 warrior @entity58 , played by @entity60			1
the handsome @entity61 admits he has found the ensuing attention overwhelming			2
and flying the flag for @entity66 hunks is @entity67 , who stars in the show vikings , which charts the tumultuous rise of @entity71 king @entity70			1
with his shaved hair , beard and quiff , @entity67 could be mistaken for a @entity76 hipster were he not pretending to be a @entity78 seafarer			1
leading the way is ' @entity13 and handsome ' @entity31 @entity89 @entity31 continues to get the nation 's ladies a little breathless in his role as captain @entity13 for the @entity33			1
the star , pretty much an unknown before the hit show , has been catapulted into the spotlight with his ' @entity89 and handsome ' appeal responsible for soaring viewing figures			1
@entity99 has stoked the fires somewhat himself by offering up some of the @entity33 beauty secrets that have transformed him into @entity104 's hero			2
@entity105 admitted to using baby oil to show off his well - honed pecs and even a slick of eyeliner to make his deep brown eyes stand out			0
although the actor wo n't be drawn on his chest hair , his man rug does appear to have been pruned ... ensuring @entity13 is pretty but still gritty			1
the other @entity25 : with his wild locks and leather outfits , actor @entity24 has stolen hearts in @entity16 , pictured above with co-star @entity117 hot metal : @entity120 actor @entity119 played wild - man @entity50 in @entity16 @entity16 actors kit @entity24 and @entity119 have brought this medieval fantasy epic to a whole new audience with their wild man antics			1
not entirely dissimilar to @entity31 in looks , @entity24 plays @entity25 ( no , not the tie - sporting @entity127 news presenter ) in the @entity27 fantastical series and matches a smattering of stubble with dark curls and puppy dog eyes			1
the star has admitted to having a ' baby face underneath all of this fuzz ' and that he has to stay away from the shampoo for the role , sometimes for as long as up to six weeks			0
describing his less - than - attentive hair regime , he told @entity139 last year : ' i like it to look greasy and medieval			0
' he admits his locks get ' very tangled ' and by the end of a six - week shoot , they look ' pretty horrible			2
' co-star @entity119 , who plays bearded brute @entity50 , has something of the @entity145 in @entity146 about him			0
until series four when @entity58 lost his right hand , his character was known as the best sword fighter in the world , cue lots of swashbuckling and rolling around in mud ... all usually by torchlight			0
the disheveled , combative image may have been toned down a little but fans continue to trip off his every word ... all of which seem to be spoken in perfect @entity161 , despite the fact that @entity163 is @entity120			2
@entity164 has never looked so good : @entity60 plays @entity166 warrior @entity58 in @entity167 , the adaptation of @entity55 's time - travel novels not a hair product in sight : @entity60 's looks are left free to curl any which way they choose in @entity15 @entity167 @entity60 plays fierce - yet - tender @entity166 warrior @entity58 in @entity167 , the adaptation of @entity55 's time - travel novels			1
with a thick @entity59 accent , @entity58 wears a kilt and faces all that a @entity166 soldier living 300 years ago might have had to , from being flung from a horse to having the skin flayed from his back			0
as a laird - turned - fighter , @entity58 's key look is ' mucking out the horses ' , all while wearing a skirt			0
his knees seem to permanently covered in mud			0
of his kilt - wearing , dashing actor @entity60 has admitted that he liked the experience			1
he said previously : ' i thoroughly enjoy it			0
when i do have to put trousers on now , i sort of refuse and stomp my feet because riding a horse in a kilt is very liberating , very freeing actually			0
also , should you ever need to do a nature relief , go to the restroom behind a tree , it 's very quick , it 's very easy			0
i recommend it for everyone			0
' swoon ! @entity206 actor @entity67 in @entity14 has come a long way since his days modelling underwear for @entity209 ... but would you mistake him for a hipster if was wearing a tight , white t - shirt ? @entity67 first shot to fame in 2002 as the face of @entity209 's famous men 's underwear range			1
his billboard posters were said to have caused traffic pile - ups in @entity218 , while the then 23 - year - old became the first male model to be signed exclusively by @entity209 for an entire year , earning him a six - figure sum vikings former @entity209 underwear model @entity67 , 35 , might not look out of place wandering down @entity226 high street when he 's dressed up as @entity71 king @entity70			1
with his hair shaved on the sides , a full beard on his chin and a greased - up quiff atop his head , there 's certainly a distinct whiff of the hipster look him about when in character			0
if the clang of chain metal floats your boat then this @entity71 family saga is brimming with rugged idols			2
not that @entity67 particularly cares for his looks			1
previously known for his long hair , perfectly groomed appearance , six - pack and bulging underpants in the @entity209 days , the actor does n't mind how he looks onscreen these days			0
he told @entity248 : ' i do n’t give a s * * * about that			0
we ’ve got a whole team to make us look good			0
' if anything the actor finds the deliberate dressing up something of a chore			0
he said : ' my hair takes 40 minutes and the costume takes 20 minutes to get into			2
it means i have to get up an hour earlier in the morning			0

@entity31 in @entity89 perfects the rugged costume drama look
