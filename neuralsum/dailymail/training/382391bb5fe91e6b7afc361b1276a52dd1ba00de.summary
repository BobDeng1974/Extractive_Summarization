republicans clashed with the @entity2 's new commissioner wednesday in a @entity4 hearing that featured the unveiling a document indicating that the agency planned as early as 2012 to change its rules in a way that justified singling out tea party groups for special scrutiny			1
the document , an email from @entity14 tax policy attorney @entity13 to a group of @entity2 officials including the disgraced @entity17			2
' do n’t know who in your organizations is keeping tabs on c4s , ' @entity13 wrote , quoting an election law blog and referring to the @entity24 ( 4 ) tax - exempt groups that were the subject of the tea party targeting scandal , ' but since we mentioned potentially addressing them ( off plan ) in 2013 , i ’ve got my radar up and this seemed interesting			1
' @entity36 chairman rep. @entity35 insisted wednesday that @entity13 's note indicated that new regulations were planned as a ' remedy to the target [ ing ] ' back in 2011 and 2012			2
' i ’m pretty sure [ off - plan ] means " hidden from the public " , ' he said			0
scroll down for the full document @entity47 , the new @entity2 commissioner , fended off tough questions on wednesday tea party groups say the @entity2 targeted them for their political beliefs but the government agency has been slow to turn over documents showing if the slow - walking of tax - exempt applications was a conscious effort to cripple the organizations a @entity14 email unveiled during wednesday ? s hearing shows the @entity2 considered new rules that would hamper tea party groups a month after the targeting scandal broke the revelation that the @entity2 planned two years ago to change the way it approached approving those groups for tax - exempt status is raising eyebrows because it indicates the agency was aware early on that its practice of singling out conservative groups was out of sync with existing regulations			1
in november the @entity2 formalized those plans , raising the hackles of @entity0 who say officials are trying to codify the tactics that put right - wing groups applying for tax - exempt status in perpetual limbo while liberal groups were quickly approved			1
the hearing brought out attacks from @entity0 members of the @entity36 who grilled newly minted @entity2 commissioner @entity47 over the timeline , saying it proved his agency knew it was acting improperly long before an inspector general report revealed the depth of the tea party targeting program			1
that report prompted president @entity93 to ask for the resignation of acting irs commissioner @entity95			1
republicans in the @entity97 have uncovered evidence that @entity2 officials in @entity100 directed a field office in @entity102 to put a ' hold ' on tea party groups ' applications , but the scandal has not reached the level of direct @entity109 involvement			2
not amused : @entity36 chairman @entity35 is demanding documents that will show if the @entity2 moved to change its rules because officials knew they were unfairly targeting conservative groups @entity118 subcommittee chairman rep. @entity116 ( @entity119 ) and ranking member @entity120 sparred wednesday over the @entity2 's program that singled out right - wing groups for lengthy scrutiny poster child ? then - @entity2 director of exempt organizations @entity17 refused to testify on may 22 , 2013 about her part in targeting tea party groups during the 2010 election season another subcommittee , in the @entity97 , will hold a separate hearing on thursday and has invited @entity131 , the attorney in charge of the @entity2 's internal investigation , to testify			1
she has not said whether she will show up to answer questions			0
attempts to contact @entity131 on wednesday were unsuccessful			0
she has attracted conservatives ' barbs for her political leanings , evidenced by more than $ 6,000 in contributions to the political campaigns of president @entity93 and other @entity142			1
president @entity93 claimed sunday in a televised interview with @entity145 host @entity144 that the @entity2 was n't engaged in partisan witch hunts of conservative groups during the 2010 election season , despite statistics that suggest otherwise @entity150 's refusal to testify about her actions			1
' the president claimed there was not " even a smidgeon of corruption " at the @entity2 , ' complained @entity154 @entity0 rep. @entity116 during the hearing , ' and he blamed the targeting on " bone - headed decisions " by " a local office			1
" now , this committee has actually investigated the matter , and found otherwise			0
the president ’s staff is either ill - informed or they are misleading him			0
' @entity116 chairs the subcommittee that held wednesday 's hearing			0
he and @entity35 have demanded documents from @entity47 detailing the timeline and process behind the regulatory changes , but the @entity2 commissioner has pushed back saying that providing the material would ' interfere ' with his agency 's rulemaking			2
not ' a smidgen of corruption ' : in a @entity178 interview , president @entity93 told @entity145 's @entity144 that the @entity2 's hands weer clean -- despite ongoing investigations that still might prove otherwise conservatives are still angry about what they say is a @entity109 using the @entity2 as a political weapon , and point to the @entity185 administration for comparison ' adding insult to injury ... the @entity2 continues to withhold documents requested by this committee pursuant to an ongoing investigation , ' @entity116 saud			1
' commissioner @entity47 , turn over the documents your agency owes us and let ’s start this relationship on the right foot			0
' ' i want to be perfectly clear , ' said @entity35			0
' this committee will fight any and all efforts to restrict the rights of groups to organize , speak - out and educate the public , just as unions are allowed to do so			0
' ' we will get to the bottom of this , and i expect the @entity2 to produce – quickly – the outstanding documents the committee has requested			0
' democrats on the subcommittee mocked @entity0 ' efforts to press for answers , framing them as a political witch hunt aimed at @entity93 during a congressional election year that will determine the shape of @entity100 politics during the president 's final two years in office			2
' all of these efforts to tie this to the @entity109 have been fallacious , ' said @entity225 rep. @entity225 of @entity226			0
@entity47 indicated that he wants to put the entire matter in the @entity2 's rear - view mirror			2
' nobody wants this investigation to be completed sooner than i do , ' he said during his testimony , adding later that ' i 'd like to close the 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) issue			0
' tea party groups have complained , however , that investigators – including the politically conflicted @entity131 – have never contacted them about how their tax - exempt applications were delayed for as long as three years while left - leaning groups won near - instant approval .			1

the @entity2 was working on a plan to justify targeting some *nonprofit* groups for special scrutiny as early as 2012 , according to a new document
republicans demanded answers on wednesday as the @entity2 *circled* its *wagons*
president @entity93 said there was n't ' a smidgen of corruption ' in a plan that singled out right - wing groups applying for tax exemptions
the new timeline shows that the @entity2 was working to change its rules long before an inspector general report revealed the depth of the targeting
investigators still have n't interviewed many conservative groups that were denied tax - exempt status while their liberal *counterparts* sailed through
