by @entity0 published : 13:01 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 11:19 est , 13 march 2013 @entity3 's curiosity rover has found that the red planet could have once supported primitive life			1
an analysis of a rock sample collected by the rover found key chemical ingredients			1
' we have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life , that probably if this water was around and you had been there , you would have been able to drink it , ' said @entity16 , @entity2 's project scientist			1
the rock was analysed in two of the rovers onboard chemistry labs : @entity38 at @entity20 ( @entity39 ) and @entity40 ( @entity37 ) instruments			1
' a fundamental question for this mission is whether @entity20 could have supported a habitable environment , ' said @entity44 , lead scientist for @entity3 's @entity45 at the agency 's headquarters in @entity48			2
' from what we know now , the answer is yes			0
' the groundbreaking analysis by the chemical lab onboard the @entity2 rover shows ancient @entity20 could have supported living microbes			1
scientists identified sulfur , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and carbon - some of the key chemical ingredients for life - in the powder @entity2 drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed in @entity29 on the @entity20 last month			1
clues to this habitable environment come from data returned by the rover 's @entity70 at @entity20 ( @entity39 ) and @entity40 ( @entity37 ) instruments			2
the data indicated the @entity73 the rover is exploring was the end of an ancient river system or an intermittently wet lake bed that could have provided chemical energy and other favorable conditions for microbes			1
the rock is made up of a fine - grained mudstone containing clay minerals , sulfate minerals and other chemicals			0
this ancient wet environment , unlike some others on @entity20 , was not harshly oxidizing , acidic or extremely salty			2
the patch of bedrock where @entity2 drilled for its first sample lies in an ancient network of stream channels descending from the rim of @entity29			2
the bedrock also is fine - grained mudstone and shows evidence of multiple periods of wet conditions , including nodules and veins			0
a self - portrait of @entity2 at the drilling site where the discovery was made this set of images shows the different types of rocks seen by @entity3 's opportunity rover and @entity2 at two different parts of @entity20			1
on the left is ' @entity112 ' rock , in @entity113 , @entity114 , as studied by the opportunity rover			0
on the right are the rocks of the ' sheepbed ' unit in @entity73 , in @entity29 , as seen by @entity2			0
@entity2 's drill collected the sample at a site just a few hundred yards away from where the rover earlier found an ancient streambed in september 2012			1
' clay minerals make up at least 20 percent of the composition of this sample , ' said @entity127 , principal investigator for the @entity37 instrument at @entity3 's @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity131 these clay minerals are a product of the reaction of relatively fresh water with igneous minerals , such as olivine , also present in the sediment , @entity3 said			0
the reaction could have taken place within the sedimentary deposit , during transport of the sediment , or in the source region of the sediment			0
the presence of calcium sulfate along with the clay suggests the soil is neutral or mildly alkaline			0
scientists were surprised to find a mixture of oxidized , less - oxidized , and even non-oxidized chemicals , providing an energy gradient of the sort many microbes on @entity156 exploit to live			2
this partial oxidation was first hinted at when the drill cuttings were revealed to be gray rather than red			0
this side - by - side comparison shows the x-ray diffraction patterns of two different samples collected from the @entity20 surface by @entity3 's @entity2			1
the @entity164 ( left ) suggests a dry , aeolian ( wind - shaped ) environment with low water activity			0
the @entity169 pattern ( right ) suggests a lacustrine ( lakebed ) environment with high water activity			0
this full - resolution image from @entity3 's @entity2 shows the turret of tools at the end of the rover 's extended robotic arm on aug. 20 , 2012 ' the range of chemical ingredients we have identified in the sample is impressive , and it suggests pairings such as sulfates and sulfides that indicate a possible chemical energy source for micro-organisms , ' said @entity188 , principal investigator of the @entity39 suite of instruments at @entity3 's @entity191 in @entity192 , @entity193 an additional drilled sample will be used to help confirm these results for several of the trace gases analyzed by the @entity39 instrument			1
' we have characterized a very ancient , but strangely new ' gray @entity20 ' where conditions once were favorable for life , ' said @entity16 , @entity200 project scientist at the @entity201 in @entity202 , @entity131 this false - color map shows the area within @entity29 on @entity20 , where @entity3 's curiosity rover landed on aug. 5 , and the location where @entity2 collected its first drilled sample at the ' @entity169 ' rock ' @entity2 is on a mission of discovery and exploration , and as a team we feel there are many more exciting discoveries ahead of us in the months and years to come			1
' scientists now plan to work with @entity2 in the ' @entity73 ' area for many more weeks before beginning a long drive to @entity29 's central mound , @entity219			2
investigating the stack of layers exposed on @entity219 , where clay minerals and sulfate minerals have been identified from orbit , may add information about the duration and diversity of habitable conditions .			0
