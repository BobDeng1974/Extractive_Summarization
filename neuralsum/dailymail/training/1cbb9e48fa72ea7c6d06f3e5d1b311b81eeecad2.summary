tens of thousands of woman could suffer a rare cancer caused by a banned drug taken by their mothers or even grandmothers			1
the drug , @entity8 ( des ) , was freely prescribed to pregnant women in @entity10 for three decades up to 1973 , and was supposed to prevent miscarriages			1
but it was belatedly banned in @entity10 after it was found to increase the risk of miscarriage – and it is now feared that it can lead to a deadly cancer to a second and even third generation			1
hundreds of thousands of pregnant mothers are estimated to have been exposed to @entity8 but there is no confirmed figure some 2,000 women have already sought compensation in @entity22 , with payouts totalling up to £ 1bn from the numerous drug companies that sold @entity8 , while scores more are launching more legal action			1
now fresh compensation cases are set to begin here , with tens of thousands of @entity10 women to be asked if they could be potential victims of the drug nicknamed ‘ the silent @entity31 ’			1
as well as causing a rare cervical and vaginal cancer , and possibly breast cancer , in the daughters , and potentially grandchildren , of the women who took it long ago , @entity8 is also being blamed for causing fertility problems			1
the drug , a synthetic copy of the female hormone oestrogen , was created in @entity10 in 1938 , and was soon being prescribed to millions of women around the world			2
@entity45 , 40 , lives with her husband @entity46 and three daughters in @entity49			2
she found out she had been exposed to @entity8 when she was a teenager and miscarried when she was 29			1
she told the @entity51 on sunday it was tiring having to educate gps on the effects of @entity8 , and made her feel paranoid			2
' it has been a battle for me , ' she said			0
' des daughters are at risk of ( breast ) cancer over 40 , yet my gp said i ca n't have regular breast examinations because i am not 50			1
' she will have to pay for private check - ups as a result			0
mrs @entity65 said her mother felt guilty even though she did n't know she was putting her daughter at risk			0
she herself is worried that her own daughters may suffer			0
doubts about the wisdom of using it surfaced in 1953 , when an @entity22 study showed it caused more , rather than fewer miscarriages			1
but it was not until 1971 that @entity22 authorities told doctors to stop prescribing it - after it was found that one in a thousand of the daughters of women prescribed des had developed the cervical and vaginal cancer ‘ clear cell adenocarcinoma ’ ( @entity85 )			1
and it was only in 1973 that @entity10 doctors were advised to stop prescribing the drug			0
the @entity89 has suggested 7,500 @entity10 women took @entity8 , but there are other claims that up to 300,000 could be at risk			1
figures suggest that daughters of women who took the drug are made 40 times more likely to develop the cancer @entity85 , often when young adults			1
the cancer is fatal in more than a quarter of cases			2
one study suggested that breast cancer risk is also doubled			1
it will be impossible for many possible victims to find out , of course , whether their mothers or grandmothers used the drug			0
research on rodents has lent weight to the fear that @entity8 dangerously alters dna not only in the individual taking the drug , but also that those changes are passed on at least two generations			1
@entity120 lawyer @entity119 , who is representing the 80 @entity22 women currently seeking compensation , is due in @entity10 in a fortnight to arrange a search for potential victims here			1
the first woman in @entity10 found to have suffered as a result of des taken by her mother is @entity129 , 59 , of @entity130 in @entity131			2
she was diagnosed with vaginal cancer aged 25 , then went through a hysterectomy and other surgery			2
records showed her mother had taken @entity8 in the 1950s , but because she did not know which company produced it , has been unable to bring legal action			0
mrs @entity129 said : ‘ one of the problems is that unlike @entity31 , where you see the problem the minute the baby was born , women who took @entity8 had healthy babies			2
‘ problems were hidden until the teens and twenties , by which point we were forgotten about			0
when i asked my mum what she had taken , she did n’t even remember the name of the stuff			0
it is a complete and utter minefield			0
’ among others who believe they have been afflicted in @entity10 are @entity156 , 61 , of @entity157 - whose mother died from lung cancer aged 32 – who had to have much of her cervix removed when she was 20			0
she suffered a miscarriage , then had two daughters			0
one , @entity164 , 26 , has had pre-cancerous cells found in her cervix , she said			0
mrs @entity156 said : ‘ i feel guilty for my girls			0
it messes with your mind ; it makes you ask why you had to have children			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity173 spoke of having ‘ every sympathy ’ for self - proclaimed victims , but said : ‘ with regard to compensation for people who believe they have been adversely affected by this drug , this is a matter for the manufacturer ( s ) and / or the @entity10 licensees of the drug			0

recent study found drug doubled risk of breast cancer in des daughters aged over 40
around 2,000 women have brought cases against drug companies in @entity22 after @entity8 exposure
