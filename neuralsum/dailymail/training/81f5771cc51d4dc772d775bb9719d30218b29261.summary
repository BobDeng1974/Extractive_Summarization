by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 12:15 est , 30 december 2012 ask any football fan or would - be @entity2 in the @entity3 where the top footballers live and you will get a quick answer – within the ‘ golden triangle ’ that lies between the towns of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 in @entity12			1
for 20 years , football ’s superstars have flocked to this patchwork of villages , 20 miles from @entity17 and 45 miles from @entity18			1
many of them have bought homes from multi-millionaire developer @entity22 – the man who has helped make the term ‘ footballer ’s house ’ part of estate - agent vocabulary			1
top of the league : multi-millionaire property developer @entity22 is selling his very own ' footballers house ' , complete with pool , helipad and 25 acres of land @entity22 ’s client list is impressive			1
his very first footballer transaction was with @entity43 , who played for @entity18 from 2003 to 2008 , and since then he has sold mansions to , among many others , @entity36 ’s @entity35 , @entity37 and @entity38 , and buy - to - let apartments to @entity36 manager sir @entity40 and former captain @entity41			2
yet the biggest star he sold a home to , and the client he remembers most fondly , was the boy from the back streets of @entity50 : @entity51			2
‘ people forget how young and naive @entity51 was when he first arrived in @entity17 , ’ recalls @entity22 , sitting in the study of his enormous country house in @entity54 , which is for sale at £ 15 million			1
‘ he was just 18 , his @entity57 was poor and i remember he had a trusted friend – a waiter in @entity17 – whom he made his financial adviser			1
' my abiding memory of @entity51 is calling in to see him in the leisure complex of the house i sold him			1
he and his friend were trying to make their own ice bath			0
they had bought an industrial - size ice - making machine and were trying to shovel ice into a plunge pool			0
big player : the ' @entity75 themed ' dining room at @entity76 grand designs : the grand pool with skylights and tropical fish mural ‘ they had laid the wires from this machine across the wet floor and jammed the bare flex into sockets with bits of pencil			0
sir @entity40 never knew how close he came to having £ 80 million worth of footballer go up in smoke			0
’ @entity22 ’s involvement in property was originally little more than a casual punt			1
in 1997 , he sold 25 per cent of his @entity96 sports retail business for £ 19 million			2
the property market was booming , so he spent £ 400,000 converting @entity98 , near @entity99 in @entity12 , into mews cottages			2
when he sold these on for £ 800,000 , he got a taste for the easy money to be made			2
@entity22 decided to specialise in the top end of the residential market , hitting on a formula that ideally matched young footballers ’ tastes			2
he would buy a dated home on a good - sized plot in the golden triangle , knock it down and build another in its place			0
when he built the new home , he would create a huge extended basement			0
the homes all had underfloor heating and state - of - the - art sound , lighting and security systems			0
leisure centres with saunas and cinema rooms were a ‘ must ’			0
now @entity22 is selling his own home , @entity76 , which is a template for the footballers ’ homes he ’s sold			1
indeed , he used it as a show house when he tried to interest cricket star @entity130 in buying one of his properties off - plan			0
true ' footballer 's house ' : @entity76 , is located in an area of @entity12 known as the ' golden triangle ' due to the high number of footballers who reside there every imaginable item of ostentation is on show : the white drawing room has enormous chandeliers , gold - leaf cornices and hand - made carpets , while the dining room , in royal blue and reds , has an @entity75 feel to it			1
to most people it may seem wildly over the top but @entity22 reckons it is quite subdued , compared with the tastes of many of the stars			1
‘ @entity51 ordered a bedroom in a mass of black satin from @entity163 , ’ he says			0
‘ on his bed he had three enormous cushions , one with a c , the second with an @entity168 and the third with a 7 – his initials and shirt number			0
’ although the tastes of footballers match the stereotype , @entity22 is keen to contradict the image of their wives			2
‘ they are portrayed very unfairly , ’ he says			0
‘ they are always very attractive but the ones i have met – notably @entity37 ’s wife and @entity180 ’s – have been very quiet and charming too			0
’ there is wit in @entity22 ’s house			1
in the pool , a mural creates the illusion of swimming off @entity188 ’s @entity187			0
the 25 acres of grounds , which include a @entity192 water garden , fishing lake , tennis court , golf tee and green and heli - pad , also hide deer which are , on closer inspection , made of stone			1
@entity22 lost his property business in the 2008 banking crash , but he still owns swathes of the ‘ golden triangle ’ and his reason for selling is unrelated to business			1
‘ i built this house in 1997 with my first wife and it still has her stamp on it , ’ says @entity22 , who has been married to his present wife , @entity207 , for four years			1
‘ now we are going to build the same house again – but slightly smaller			0
