by @entity0 published : 03:30 est , 4 april 2012 updated : 07:20 est , 17 april 2012 mystery : the naked and decomposing body of @entity3 , 31 , was found locked inside a holdall in the bath of his home in @entity8 , central @entity9 , in august 2010 evidence that could hold the key to the mystery of the spy found dead in a padlocked sports bag might have been wiped from his computers before they were given to police , it has been claimed			1
@entity20 spy @entity3 's family fear @entity22 agents filtered out potential clues when they wiped data to conceal details of his classified work after his untimely death			1
according to the pre-inquest hearing held last week , @entity29 's @entity28 examined all of mr @entity3 's computers before handing them to murder detectives			1
but mr @entity3 's family have raised questions about the role of the command - codenamed @entity28 - in the inquiry and want a witness from the squad to explain its role			1
coroner @entity41 : ' the family have expressed concerns to this court and want clarification of the role of @entity28 in this inquiry			1
' i hope a witness from @entity28 can attend and explain , ' she added , according to the @entity48			2
she confirmed that ' all computers , it and phones were examined first by @entity28 ' before they were handed over to the murder squad			2
the discovery of mr @entity3 's body in his flat near the @entity20 headquarters in @entity9 sparked a 20 - month police inquiry that has so far drawn a blank			1
mr @entity3 's family last week said they believe their son may have been killed by a secret agent			1
their barrister suggested a sinister cover - up had left them with no way of knowing how and mr @entity3 died			1
security experts have agreed that the death had all the hallmarks of a professional killing , suggesting that a @entity72 or @entity73 hit squad may have been involved			0
it emerged at the inquest last week that the flat may have been swept clean of evidence , with no fingerprints or @entity79 anywhere			2
it was also revealed that – far from being a back - office worker – mr @entity3 had just completed training for deployment on operations			2
other revelations included : suspicions : relatives believe a third party was either present when @entity3 died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence , lawyer @entity88 said the naked body of the super-fit maths prodigy was found in a large padlocked @entity96 bag in the bath of his @entity98 - owned @entity8 flat in august 2010			1
the codebreaker from @entity101 , @entity102 , was said to have links to @entity9 's bondage and gay scene and it had already been suggested a sex game , possibly with a colleague , may have had a tragic end			0
but @entity110 coroner dr @entity41 has heard that his grieving family fear whoever is responsible has expertly covered up the evidence			2
their barrister @entity88 rejected the conclusion of an internal @entity20 inquiry that mr @entity3 's death ' had nothing to do with his work '			1
he said : ' there is a high probability that some third party was in the flat when @entity3 was placed in the bag			0
evidentially there seems to be no trace of an unknown party in the flat			0
' our impression is that the unknown third party was a member of some agency specialising in the dark arts or secret services			0
' or perhaps evidence has been removed from the scene post-mortem by experts in those arts			0
' mr @entity3 , pictured riding his bike , was found dead inside a body bag similar to the one pictured , right mr @entity3 , an expert in cyber defences , was nearing the end of a one - year secondment from the @entity148 listening station to the headquarters of the @entity20 , or @entity20 , in @entity150 , @entity9			1
shortly before his death he had returned from a clandestine visit to @entity153 where he had worked alongside @entity155 agents in operations to counter infiltrations by @entity159 and @entity72 computer hackers			0
mr @entity3 's body was discovered by police at his flat on august 23 , 2010			1
he was found naked inside a red @entity96 holdall , which was padlocked on the outside and placed inside his bath			0
a wide - ranging and highly sensitive police inquiry has left many questions unanswered over the circumstances of his death , dr @entity41 heard			2
experts believe it would have been ' difficult , if not impossible ' for mr @entity3 to lock himself in the bag but can find no evidence of anyone else being present			2
his body was found curled in the foetal position in the 140 - litre black and red holdall with the keys to the @entity180 travel padlock beneath him			0
pathologists found no evidence of injuries or that he attempted to fight his way out			0
it remains possible that his dead body was put inside the bag			0
dr @entity41 said that whether mr @entity3 was alive inside the bag and locked it himself ' was at the very heart of this inquiry '			1
she may order officials to recreate how he could have got inside it at the full inquest which is due to take place next month			0
experts have been unable to agree on exactly how mr @entity3 died , favouring asphyxiation or hypercapnia , a catastrophic build - up of carbon dioxide in the blood			1
their work was hampered by the heavily decayed state of his body and his @entity20 colleagues face questions over why they did not raise the alarm earlier			2
last images : @entity208 released @entity209 of his last known movements at @entity212 tube station questions : the family want to know why the alarm was not raised when mr @entity3 failed to turn up to work and why it took his sister @entity218 , pictured left at his funeral , to ring police to make them aware he was missing it also emerged at the inquest that @entity29 detectives spent almost 20 months pursuing a dna trace on his body that was left by a clumsy forensic scientist			1
the chief executive of @entity228 will be hauled before the inquest to explain the astonishing blunder which was discovered only last month ago			0
red herring : it also emerged that a @entity233 couple police wanted to speak to were irrelevant to mr @entity3 's death the inquest also heard that a @entity233 couple who called at mr @entity3 's block had nothing to do with the case			1
detectives released e-fits of the couple and have now traced them			0
they were looking for a friend 's house			0
the inquest heard that mr @entity3 's family were unhappy about several aspects of the inquiry , including the role of counter-terrorism officers who dealt with @entity20 and @entity148 staff			1
they have raised questions about who ordered a second post-mortem examination and what happened to mr @entity3 's possessions held in a work locker			2
the family also want to hear more details about the nature of his work but @entity20 representatives said disclosing the information could endanger national security			0
dr @entity41 attacked police for delaying the handover of evidence and questioned why the names of some witnesses had been withheld			0
she said some sensitive letters had gone missing			0
@entity20 has applied for several of mr @entity3 's colleagues to give evidence anonymously and from behind screens .			1

@entity28 ( @entity28 ) officers examined all of @entity3 's it *equipment* before handing it over to murder squad detectives
coroner @entity41 calls on @entity28 to *provide* a witness to the inquest to explain their role in the *investigations* into mr @entity3 's death
mr @entity3 's family believe a third party was either present when he died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence
@entity79 found on the dead spy 's hand which police believed was **significant** actually belonged to a bungling forensic scientist
relatives want to know why @entity20 did not raise the alarm when mr @entity3 failed to turn up at work - by then his body was badly decomposed
mr @entity3 had said was worried that he was being followed in the days before his death , but @entity20 failed to pass this on to murder detectives ;
an expert seeking signs of forced entry said he was hampered because the front door had been taken from its hinges and locks removed ;
pathologists still can not agree on how mr @entity3 died . the 31 - year - old suffered no visible injuries and could not have locked himself in the bag according to police ;
@entity79 found on his hand that police rated as highly **significant** was in fact left by a bungling forensic scientist .
