by @entity0 published : 08:21 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 11:09 est , 25 may 2012 as @entity2 continues to bask in the summer sunshine most people will find time to enjoy the balmy weather			1
but they should spare a thought for one man who must battle against the heat at the end of a 2,500mile run			1
former @entity12 sailor @entity11 will cover the equivalent of nearly two marathons today - an astonishing feat he has completed every day for the past 49 days			1
' i 'm setting off earlier in the morning because of the heat , ' the 29 - year - old told @entity19			1
' staying motivated throughout each day has been hard , especially when the pain sets in			2
' in training : @entity11 has never run in a competitive race before and insists he 's not a natural runner the rugby player , pictured in @entity25 ( left ) has completed fifty 50mile runs around the @entity2 's coastline since he started on april 6 starting his endurance challenge in @entity29 back on april 6th , @entity11 has run for nine hours burning every day			1
his run has taken him around the whole of @entity2 's coastline from the @entity34 highlands to @entity35 in @entity36 , with his trusty white backup van bringing up the rear			1
however , he reveals that he almost threw in the towel before he had barely started			2
' the second day was the toughest ever , he said			2
' my body ached from head to toe and was going into shock due to my stupidity on the first day			2
' i had n't eaten and ran with only one break - it nearly broke me			1
but a message from my brother kept me going			2
i also wanted to prove the doubters wrong			2
even my own running coach bet against me and this pushed me forwards			2
' now mr @entity11 has a more sensible eating regime			2
he starts the day with poached eggs on toast and a cup of coffee and snacks on a flapjack and jelly babies mid morning			2
lunch is a wrap or two bananas while dinner tends to be a high - calorie three - course @entity68 meal			1
he certainly needs the energy as he is burning up to 6,000 calories a day			0
' smile big , run hard ' : @entity11 running in @entity72 on day 21 and reaching @entity73 on day 37 @entity11 with a soldier in @entity75 on @entity76 of his challenge mr @entity11 said he was inspired to take on the epic run because it was something that had n't been done in @entity2 before and he ' wanted to see how much my body and mind could take			1
' what make this more surprising is he insists he is not a natural runner at all			0
' last december i was a 14.5st rugby player and i had never run a competitive race in my life , ' he said			0
' i only ran more than 20 miles for the first time this year			1
' mr @entity11 is using his personal mission to fundraise for the military charity @entity91 and hopes to raise Â£ 20,000			0
' there are ex service men on my rugby team and a couple who are about to go into the army , ' he said			0
' one thing that has been keeping me going are the messages from wounded service men and women			0
' i think about my 50 days of pain then compare it to what they 've been going through			0
' it always makes me made for myself for moaning so i carry on			0
' he said social media had proved a godsend in providing him with continuous support throughout his 50 - day ordeal			1
the celebrity comedian @entity113 , who completed his own endurance challenge for @entity115 , is backing mr @entity11 on @entity116 while his @entity118 page has more than 3,000 supporters			0
he said during his run he has been struck by the ' kindness of strangers ' on the road , from the group of army lads he met in @entity75 to the countless drivers around the @entity2 who have pulled up and donated money			1
' i 'm still amazed at people 's generosity everyday , ' he said on his blog			1
' the smiles and cheers have really kept me going			0
' day one : @entity11 with friends and family at the start of his journey in @entity29 day 39 : passing by @entity138 on the long road home to combat the mental exhaustion he broke down the run in his mind into more manageable chunks			0
' i broke the time down into smaller goals , ' he said			0
' first to get a week in , then 10 days , then two weeks , half way and so on			0
while i try to keep my overall goal in mind but look at each day like i 'm going to work			0
' despite undertaking extensive training for the challenge the qualified personal trainer is also experiencing the severe wear and tear of two months hard - graft			1
' my feet are a mess , bruised and battered from 50 days on the road ' he admitted			0
' i have no toe nails and my hip has been crunched and needs ice daily			0
my left knee has begun to twist and my ankle swells on a daily basis			0
' once he finishes today 's run he only has a few more miles to go before he crosses the finish line in his hometown of @entity171 in @entity173 tomorrow lunchtime			1
remarkably though , mr @entity11 is n't keen to finish , although he says he is looking forward to seeing his friends and family as well as his dog			0
' i feel slightly sad that it 's coming to an end , ' he said			1
' but i know my body needs to rest			0
if i do n't stop soon i will cause long - term damage			1
' then after a pause , the indomitable runner added : ' i ca n't wait to plan the next one ! ' to follow @entity11 's progress and donate to his charity visit @entity184 you can donate at @entity116 account is @ @entity189			1
