new @entity1 featherweight champion @entity0 can match @entity3 's level of popularity as his career gathers pace , according to promoter @entity7			1
@entity8 continued his rise to prominence in his home city of @entity12 by stopping @entity13 in the fourth round to add the @entity1 title to his @entity17 and @entity18 straps			1
arguably more impressive than his performance was the raucous reception afforded to the 23 - year - old at the @entity22 , which took even @entity7 by surprise			1
@entity0 can match @entity3 's level of popularity , according to promoter @entity7 the promoter is convinced his young charge can capture the imagination of the city - as former two - weight world champion @entity3 did in @entity28 during his career			1
' we 've got something major here , ' said @entity7 , who revealed beforehand that @entity8 had personally sold close to 2,000 tickets himself			1
' i 've not seen anything like that			0
@entity36 and @entity37 are wonderful cities but you do n't see a thousand people taking their shirts off and swinging them over their heads			0
' this is the kind of support @entity3 had back in those days , it 's fanatical			2
it 's not just ' let 's go to @entity12 and watch some boxing '			0
it 's about one person , it 's about @entity0 , it 's a fanatical support and that means so much to someone 's career			2
' @entity7 said he was impressed with @entity8 's relationship with the crowd , comparing him to @entity3 it has been a whirlwind 12 months for @entity8 , who gained his first stoppage win as a professional in his 16th fight against @entity62 in november last year to capture the @entity18 title before winning the @entity17 title by outpointing @entity65 in @entity12 in may			1
and following his latest triumph , @entity8 ( 19 - 0 , @entity67 ) said : ' i could n't really predict what would have happened 12 months ago			2
it 's been a real rollercoaster ride			0
' picking up the @entity18 , @entity17 and now @entity1 ( titles ) has been unbelievable but i 'm loving every minute of it			1
' @entity8 started strongly on saturday night and gained reward for outworking his foe when a straight right put down @entity78 in the fourth round before a barrage immediately after prompted the referee to halt the contest			2
@entity8 beat @entity13 in the fourth to add the @entity1 title to his @entity17 and @entity18 straps ' i kept my gameplan until i knocked him down and after that it went out of the window			1
i smelt blood and went for him			0
there was no stopping those arms from going , ' @entity0 added			0
on the undercard , @entity91 made a winning start on his light - welterweight debut but was thoroughly uninspiring in a points win over lightly regarded @entity97 @entity96			0
the former two - weight world champion would have been hoping to make his mark in the 140lbs division after back - to - back defeats at lightweight and although the @entity103 put his @entity97 opponent down in the first round he largely struggled thereafter			0
the 23 - year - old @entity8 's record is now an impressive 19 - 0 with three knockouts the 31 - year - old @entity109 fighter recorded his 37th win from 42 bouts in the eight - round contest but may now move back down to lightweight			1
@entity114 bounced back from his world title setback with a first - round stoppage against @entity117			0
the @entity119 fighter , who was beaten by @entity121 light - middleweight champion @entity120 earlier this year , floored his @entity123 opponent three times for a confidence - boosting victory			2
hot prospect @entity126 continued his rise up the ranks by claiming the 14th win of his professional career with a third - round tko of @entity132 .			0

@entity0 can be the new @entity3
that is the opinion of promoter @entity7
@entity8 is the new featherweight champion
the 23 - year - old beat @entity13 to claim the crown
@entity8 adds title to his @entity17 and @entity18 ones
