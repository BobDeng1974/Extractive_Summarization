the @entity3 's granddaughter will carry the iconic flame down the finishing straight of the @entity14 in @entity7 tomorrow			1
the 31 - year - old will be riding her faithful horse , @entity17 , who is now retired , and will light a cauldron at the racecourse , which will burn throughout the country - wide event			2
she met torchbearers @entity24 , 15 , and @entity25 , 15 , as well as children from @entity27 in @entity28 , as the flame was carried from @entity30 to @entity31 to @entity32 in the west of the country			1
meanwhile , a woman was warming up to carry the torch today - just seven days after giving birth to her new - born son			1
@entity39 , 28 , was supposed to run with the flame while heavily pregnant , but gave birth to @entity42 eight days early , last wednesday			1
the charity worker , who is also battling a brain tumour , still ran 300 - metres through @entity45 , @entity46 , with the torch yesterday while tiny @entity42 looked on			1
the torch resumed its epic journey at 8am this morning , starting in @entity30 and heading through @entity50 and @entity31 towards @entity32 , where it ended the day at around 6pm			1
ms @entity39 was selected for her tireless work over more than a decade to improve the lives of individuals and communities across the @entity12 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
the mother of one , who is leading a fundraising group climbing @entity79 next year , is looking forward to the responsibility of carrying the torch , despite being heavily pregnant			1
' this is such a great time for the country			0
i feel proud to be able to carry the flame amongst such inspirational people and in such a beautiful city , ' she said			2
organisers will be hoping for a repeat of the crowded streets during the first three days of the relay when excited onlookers gathered to catch a glimpse of the torch as it made its way from @entity97 to @entity46			1
torchbearer @entity98 , 20 , from @entity99 , stands with the @entity101 flame in front of @entity103 @entity104 carrying the @entity105 on the leg between @entity107 and @entity108 - on - @entity109 fire and water : torch bearer @entity112 carries the @entity101 flame on a canal boat on her leg along the @entity116 through @entity30 today morning light : @entity119 - @entity118 , left , and @entity120 carry the @entity101 flame through @entity50 gleaming smile : torch bearer @entity123 beams as she transports the @entity105 from @entity124 to @entity125 today spotlight : miss @entity123 waved and have a delighted thumbs - up to the excited crowd that had already formed by 8am today procession : the @entity101 torch is carried near @entity132 yesterday before rapper @entity42 ran in @entity30 an olympic torch bearer who sold her torch for £ 153,100 on @entity135 says she faces a £ 15,000 bill to settle the auction site ’s selling fees because the winning bidder has so far failed to come forward			1
@entity140 , 38 , has attracted attention in recent days since controversially placing her official torch and uniform on @entity135 to raise money for the community gardening group @entity145			1
the community gardener - who ran with the flame through @entity148 , @entity46 , on monday - said she was overjoyed and flabbergasted to find the auction had raised £ 153,100			1
but since the auction ended at 10.33pm on sunday after attracting 163 bids , @entity140 says the winning bidder has not been in touch and she fears it may have been a hoax			1
she said : ' @entity135 has strict rules stating bids are legally binding contracts and an invoice has been sent to the bidder for £ 153,100 , but we have received no response so far			1
the buyer has a 100 per cent positive feedback rating based on previous purchases but just seems to have disappeared			2
' ' this is incredibly disappointing not only because @entity145 will miss out on this wonderful funding , but because it could now leave me out - of - pocket too			2
@entity135 has already been in contact asking me to pay the 10 per cent selling fee for the item , amounting to over £ 15,000			1
' we just hope that the winning bidder comes forward and fulfils the deal			1
' yesterday , rapper and music producer @entity42 made a surprise appearance and carried the torch in @entity30 town centre			1
he is one of several celebrities joining unsung heroes carrying the torch in areas including @entity31 , @entity45 and @entity32 today on the flame 's journey through @entity12			1
the torchbearers range in age from children to 91 - year - old @entity185			2

her nomination says he received an mbe in 2008 to recognise more than 30 years of community work			0
' @entity185 is one of the few people i know who is instantly recognised by just her first name			0
mention the name @entity185 in @entity107 and everyone knows who you mean , ' her nominator said			0
' not only @entity185 herself , but a great many in @entity107 too would be delighted if she were to be selected for the honour of carrying the flame			2
a fitting climax to a long life of ceaseless service to the community			0
' there is also dedicated @entity216 , 31 , from @entity217 , who will carry the torch in @entity219			2
he lost both legs while injured in a bomb blast while serving the @entity222 in @entity223 in august 2009			0
his wife , who nominated him , says : ' he lost both his legs , shattered his pelvis and suffered multiple internal injuries after spending 10 and a half weeks in hospital he was finally discharged			0

' a former heavy drinker and smoker who saw the error of her ways will carry the torch through @entity32			2
@entity243 , 36 , from @entity244 , grew up disliking exercise but changed her lifestyle after joining the @entity222			0
' @entity243 grew up hating strenuous activity and was notoriously bad at games and sport , ' her nominator says			0
' by 20 she was a heavy drinker and smoker when she had a significant health scare			0
subsequently she joined the @entity222 as a combat medic which proved strong motivation for exercise			0
' a man who became a marathon runner after losing 14 stone in 18 months will be also be in the spotlight			0
@entity262 carrying the @entity105 on the leg between @entity107 and @entity108 - on - @entity109 a torchbearer runs with the @entity101 flame along the @entity266 in @entity45 @entity267 , of @entity268 in @entity45 , said : ' in just two years i ’ve completely turned my life around			1
i ’m healthy , active and happy			0

he said : ' my radio interviews speeches and pieces in the local newspaper helped to overturn a decision to close my school just weeks before the closure was finalised			0
' i have already shown that if you put your mind to things you can achieve your desired goal			0
' there are 16 ‘ core vehicles ’ assigned to accompany the torch for its epic journey			1
everywhere the procession goes , a small army of support and ancilliary vehicles is also called into service			0
in @entity97 on saturday , for example , the convoy was escorted by police motorcyclists bearing the emblems of five separate constabularies			2
in south @entity318 , an ambulance , local dignitaries , firearms officers and police ‘ safety officers ’ on @entity317 mountain bikes joined the parade			1
it was a similar turnout yesterday in @entity318 and @entity46 , with a bomb disposal team in the convoy			0
the @entity101 organising committee insists the vehicle fleet is necessary for what it describes as a ‘ huge ’ logistical operation , adding that each one has a specific and important role			1
for the three most prominent vehicles on parade , that role is mostly commercial			0
sponsors @entity333 , @entity65 and @entity334 each have a truck or coach kitted out in brand - name colours and they travel full time with the convoy			2
by the time the convoy gets to the @entity342 in july it will have left a massive carbon footprint			0
dr @entity344 , director of @entity345 , which helps organisations to become carbon neutral , told the @entity348 that if 47 was a typical daily average for vehicles , they were likely to emit a total of 223 tons of carbon dioxide			0
that would be equivalent to driving a @entity355 hybrid car more than 1.4million miles			0
alternatively , of course , the runners could borrow a tip from @entity359 – and just run .			0
