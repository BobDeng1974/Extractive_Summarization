by @entity0 last updated at 10:15 pm on 15th july 2011 civil suit : @entity2 is suing @entity3 for defamation after the cleared mother used her name for the fictitious nanny @entity3 could face more questions over her daughter 's death , after lawyers for the woman suing the 25 - year - old for defamation demanded that she testify in the civil case			1
@entity2 has filed a lawsuit against the cleared mother , claiming her life was ruined after @entity18 used her name when she told @entity20 police little @entity3 had been kidnapped by ' @entity3 '			1
her legal team have asked the court to force @entity18 to give a deposition next week , as they fear once she is released from jail she will vanish under a new identity			1
@entity18 's lawyers intend to block the move , claiming she is is ' emotionally and mentally exhausted ' after the criminal trial			1
the demand came as @entity30 revealed twisted wellwishers are continuing to send @entity18 money , swelling her jail commissary account to $ 470 - but it 's still only $ 200 more before she was cleared of murder at the end of her sensational trial			1
strangers from @entity39 , @entity40 and even @entity41 have been sending $ 10 and $ 20 money orders , which @entity18 has been spending on sweets including @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity48 's peanut butter cups in the run up to her release on sunday			1
but two days after she walks free from jail , she could have to give a video deposition at the office of @entity54 's lawyer			2
the 42 - year - old is suing @entity18 for defamation , claiming she lost her flat and her job and found it impossible to find work in the three years since @entity18 falsely said a fictitious nanny with the same name has her had abducted @entity3			1
instead , she had made up the babysitter using @entity54 's name			0
she had the idea after she saw her details on an information card when they both visited an apartment complex on the same day			0
her lawyer says after @entity18 's claims were made public , @entity54 received death threats in the middle of the night against her and her children			1
she was fired from her job as a housekeeper , and her landlord said he did n't want her on his property			0
@entity54 's lawyer , @entity89 , told @entity90 he plans to interrogate @entity18 about her daughter 's death - a move @entity18 's legal team are likely to strongly oppose , saying it is n't relevant to the civil case			1
mr @entity89 said : ' the first question i 'm going to ask her is , " tell us the last time you saw @entity3 "			2
the second is , " tell us when you found out she was dead "			0
' pocket money : wellwishers , including a @entity40 woman also called @entity108 , have sent $ 10 and $ 20 money orders to the jail sweet treats : funds in @entity3 's jailhouse account today reached $ 470 thanks to the donations dismissing their possible objections , he said : ' everything about the death of the child is not only relevant , it 's very relevant			1
it 's the essence of the case			0
they want to make [ @entity3 ] sit down and tell them what happened			0
' he will hold a meeting with @entity18 's lawyers tomorrow to discuss the deposition			1
today they officially filed an objection , asking the hearing to be cancelled because @entity18 had suffered ' trauma ' during the murder trial			2
they also claim that as the dates and location of her deposition have been made public , her safety would be in jeopardy because of the ' numerous threats that have already been made against her '			0
in a verdict that shocked @entity124 , on july 6 the jury found her not guilty of murdering her two - year - old old daughter , @entity3			1
she was sentenced to four years in jail after being convicted on four counts of lying to police , behind bars : @entity3 will walk free from @entity30 jail on sunday 17 july the judge gave her the longest possible sentence he could , but he said @entity18 could go free on july 17 because she has already served nearly three years and will get credit for good behaviour			1
but @entity54 's lawyers want the court to compel her to appear at a deposition on july 19 , because they are concerned when she is released from prison on sunday she will ' leave the jurisdiction of this court , disguise herself , change her name , etc. , making it impossible to ever depose her			2
' mr @entity89 said : ' when @entity170 first came to me , we never thought @entity108 would see the light of day again			0
it was never about money in the beginning			0
now , it 's about accountability and responsibility			0
' the civil trial is due to begin in february			0
@entity18 could also face two other civil actions			2
prosecutors asked have the judge to recoup investigative cost for them and authorities			0
new questions : lawyer @entity89 says he plans to grill @entity3 over her daughter @entity3 's death in a civil deposition for a defamation case brought by @entity2 the mandatory minimums for those are $ 100 per case for felonies and $ 50 per case for misdemeanours			1
the state is seeking reimbursement for more than that and said in a motion that it has documentation of what it calls special costs			0
@entity205 , a firm that helped for @entity3 , also said it was seeking compensation for the $ 112,000 it spent looking for the two - year - old , and said it is contemplating a lawsuit			2
as @entity18 prepares for her release on sunday , money continues to be sent to her from as far away as @entity41			0
records reveal that sweet - toothed @entity18 has been buying candy including @entity218 bars as well as packets of @entity46 , kitkats and @entity48 's peanut butter cups			2
other items purchased include nachos with cheese and a jalapeno dip , flour tortillas and peanut butter .			0

lawyers for real ' @entity3 ' demand to grill @entity18 in civil deposition because ' @entity124 wants justice '
@entity18 's legal team try to block request as she is ' emotionally and mentally exhausted ' after criminal trial
her jail account swells to $ 470 as more wellwishers send *cheques* to cleared mother
