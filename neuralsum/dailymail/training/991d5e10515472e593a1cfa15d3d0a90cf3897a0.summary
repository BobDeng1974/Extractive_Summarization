drinking coffee can help prevent obesity , scientists claim			1
a new study has identified a chemical compound in the caffeinated drink helps prevent some of the damaging effects of being overweight			0
@entity8 acid , or @entity9 , significantly reduced insulin resistance and the accumulation of fat in the livers of mice who were fed a high - fat diet			1
the rodents were put on a high - fat diet for 15 weeks , during which time scientists at the @entity20 injected them with a @entity9 solution twice a week			1
scientists at the @entity20 discovered that cholorgenic acid in coffee , significantly reduced insulin resistance and the accumulation of fat in the livers of mice fed a high - fat diet for 15 weeks they discovered @entity9 was not only effective in preventing weight gain , it also helped maintain normal blood sugar levels and a healthy liver			1
lead author , dr @entity33 from the university 's @entity34 , said : ' previous studies have shown that coffee consumption may lower the risk for chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease			0
' our study expands on this research by looking at the benefits associated with this specific compound , which is found in great abundance in coffee , but also in other fruits and vegetables like apples , pears , tomatoes and blueberries			1
' during the past 20 years , there has been a dramatic increase in obesity in the @entity58 and @entity59			0
common side effects of obesity , aside from weight gain , are increased insulin resistance and a build - up of fat in the liver			2
left untreated , these disorders can cause diabetes and poor liver function			0
' cga is a powerful antioxidant that reduces inflammation , ' said dr @entity33 , who works in the laboratory of professor @entity74 in the department of pharmaceutical and biomedical sciences			0
' a lot of evidence suggests that obesity - related diseases are caused by chronic inflammation , so if we can control that , we can hopefully offset some of the negative effects of excessive weight gain			2
' but the researchers said @entity9 alone is not a cure for obesity			1
maintaining a healthy diet and taking regular exercise are still the best methods to reduce the risks associated with obesity			2
the researchers said while @entity9 alone is not a cure for obesity , their findings could pave the way for future treatments for those struggling to lose weight through conventional methods ( file picture ) the mice in this study received a high dose of @entity9 , higher than that a human would absorb through regular coffee consumption or a diet rich in fruits and vegetables			1
but the scientists believe @entity9 may provide the foundation for a treatment for those in need of extra help to tackle their weight			2
they said more research is needed to develop an improved @entity9 formulation specifically for human consumption			0
' we 're not suggesting that people start drinking a lot of coffee to protect themselves from an unhealthy lifestyle , ' said dr @entity33			0
' but we do think that we might be able to create a useful therapeutic using @entity9 that will help those at risk for obesity - related disease as they make positive lifestyle changes			1
' the study was published in @entity137 .			0

mice were fed a high - fat diet for 15 weeks during which time scientists gave them twice - weekly injections of the compound cholorgenic acid
found @entity9 helped maintain normal blood sugar levels and healthy livers
@entity9 is found in coffee and apples , pears , tomatoes and blueberries
scientists warn it is not a cure for obesity but could pave the way for one
