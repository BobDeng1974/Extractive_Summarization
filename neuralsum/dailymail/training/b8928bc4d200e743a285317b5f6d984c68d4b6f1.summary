in some cases , mumps can lead to viral meningitis if it moves into the outer layer of the brain			2
it can be especially dangerous for men - as it can cause swelling of the testicles which can affect fertility			2
despite the outbreak , the @entity34 still held a boozy ‘ bop ’ - a party at the hall for around 100 students on saturday			1
college entertainment officer @entity40 sent an email to all the students reminding them about the party			2
his email was sent just two days after college nurse @entity45 warned students about the mumps outbreak			1
mr @entity40 ’s email said : ‘ hey everyone			0
just a reminder that despite the mumps situation the arts week bop will still be taking place tonight [ saturday ]			2
‘ the theme is literary characters and as usual proceedings will start dtb [ down the bar ] before moving over to the new @entity60 , the castle tavern , at around 11			0
‘ it promises to be a great end to arts week and i hope to see you all there ! ’ a university nurse sent a message to all undergraduates warning about the highly infectious virus - which causes painfully inflamed glands and swelling - last thursday one third - year @entity74 student , who asked not to be named , described the outbreak as a ‘ crisis ’			1
they said : ‘ it ’s absolutely ridiculous			0
‘ we got an email from the college nurse telling everyone to be wary of mumps and then two days later we had a massive party			2
‘ this place is like a ghost town - so many people have either gone home because they do n’t want to get sick , or are lying in bed ill. ‘ this is exam season - these are the most important exams of my life , so i really do n’t want to get ill. prime minister @entity2 is just one of many famous former @entity6 students ‘ it ’s so irresponsible for the @entity34 not to cancel the bop on saturday night			1
‘ i did n’t go but i know quite a few people that went and have now come down with mumps			2
‘ there are about 200 people at the college and i reckon at least 30 are already ill. ‘ it ’s a crisis - if any final year students get ill now , they may have to wait a year to take their final exams			1
‘ i do n’t want to have to do that - we should have a quarantine , rather than more parties			2
’ cases of mumps have also been confirmed at @entity113 ’s and @entity114 colleges , both in @entity7			1
in an email to @entity118 students , the welfare dean @entity115 wrote : ‘ it has been brought to our attention that there are several cases of mumps within the @entity10 and there have been two confirmed cases within @entity118			1

' the college is advising any students who suspect they might have mumps - like symptoms to stay in their room and phone the college nurse or gp for advice			1
' they refused to comment on about the party organised by the @entity34 mumps - hit @entity6			1
the prime minister is just one of many famous former @entity6 students who also include @entity159 comedian @entity158 and @entity162 rower @entity160			1
mumps , as well as measles and rubella , is vaccinated against using the @entity167 jab			0
a full course of the @entity167 vaccine requires two jabs			0
the vaccine was first introduced in the @entity172 in 1988 as a single injection for children under the age of one - with the necessity for a second injection only becoming apparent eight years later in 1996			0
the second jab is administered between the ages of three and five			0
taking this in to account , this means some of the older students at the college are at a heightened risk of getting mumps			2
in 1998 , a paper claiming there was a link between the vaccine and autism was published by dr @entity192			0
a great number of parents therefore decided their children should not receive the vaccine			0
their children would be around the age of 16 now			0
according to statistics released by the @entity140 , the percentage of @entity167 uptake in the @entity172 fell from 88.3 per cent in 1998 to a low of 79.9 per cent in 2003			0
@entity192 's work has since been completely discredited , however			0
he has been struck off the register as a medical professional in the @entity172 in 2010			0
studies since have not found any such link between the vaccine and autism or bowel disease .			0
