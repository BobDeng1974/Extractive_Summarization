the @entity0 is drying up at an incredible rate leaving huge chasms of empty space in its wake			1
these chasms appear in the form of large , devastating sinkholes and are increasing in number throughout the region			2
experts claim they are now forming at a rate of nearly one a day , but have no way of knowing when or how they will show up			0
the @entity0 is drying up at an incredible rate leaving huge chasms of empty space in its wake estimates by @entity15 suggest that , on the @entity18 side alone , there are now over 3,000 sinkholes around the @entity0			1
this compares to just 40 counted in 1990 , with the first sinkhole appearing in the 1980s			1
the @entity0 spans more than 60 miles through @entity18 , the @entity22 , and @entity23			1
its waters are 10 times saltier than the northern @entity25 because it has no outlet			0
this means that any minerals that flow there , stay there			0

the increase in sinkholes is directly related to the @entity0 drying up at a rate of one meter per year the @entity0 spans more than 60 miles through @entity18 , the @entity22 , and @entity23			1
its water level has fallen from 394 meters below sea level in the 1960s to about423 meters below sea level as of end 2012			0
as a result , the @entity49 ’s water surface area has been reduced by one third : from roughly 950 square kilometers to 637 square kilometers today			0
the water level continues to drop at an alarming pace of 0.8 to 1.2 meters per year			0
the significant decline of the water level over the past 30 years is due to diversion of water from the @entity57 and from the @entity0 itself due to population increase			2
the increase in sinkholes is directly related to the @entity0 drying up at a rate of one meter per year			1
sinkholes are basically bowl - shaped features that form when an empty space under the ground creates a depression			0
the depression is the result of a reaction between freshwater and salt buried in a subterranean level beneath the surface			0
when the freshwater dissolves the salt , it creates a void , causing the landscape around and above it to suddenly collapse			0
over the last few decades , increasing numbers of people have been drawn to the @entity0 causing its salt water to dry up			1
this leaves more fresh water in the area to dissolve the salt and create more cavities			0
sinkholes pock - mark the emerging shoreline of the @entity0 near @entity86			1
the sinkholes are caused by fresh groundwater dissolving subterranean salt deposits that once formed the bottom of the @entity0 to bring the world 's attention to @entity0 's plight artist @entity93 shot the first mass nude shoot in the @entity0 in 2011 one solution being presented by the @entity96 is to create a canal linking the @entity0 to either the @entity98			1
but environmentalists warn that doing this could spell the end for the @entity0			2
experts believe more needs to be done to highlight the plight of the @entity0 and come up with a solution			2
for instance to bring the world 's attention to the challenge artist @entity93 shot the first mass nude shoot in the @entity0 in 2011			2
‘ human intervention has just about killed the @entity0 , ’ @entity108 , professor in the @entity109 at @entity110 , told @entity15			2
‘ it will take extraordinary human measures — careful , wise intervention and positive regional cooperation — to save it			0
’ estimates suggest that , on the @entity18 side alone , there are now over 3,000 sinkholes around the @entity0			1

the @entity0 is drying up at a rate of one meter per year causing sinkholes
there are now over 3,000 sinkholes around the @entity0 on the @entity18 side
this compares to 40 in 1990 , with the first sinkhole appearing in the 1980s
