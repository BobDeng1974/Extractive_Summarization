@entity1 could launch a @entity3 - style terrorist strike if it is hit with an international oil embargo , an academic warned last night			1
professor @entity5 , a senior research fellow at think - tank @entity6 , said it was ‘ extremely unlikely ’ @entity9 would not retaliate against crippling sanctions			2
however , he said he doubted it would carry out its threat to blockade the @entity14 , one of the world ’s busiest shipping lanes , for fear of creating a ‘ shooting war ’ with the @entity20 the @entity3 atrocity saw @entity3 from @entity22 to @entity23 brought down by a bomb planted on the orders of @entity26 shipping route : @entity1 authorities have threatened to close the @entity14 , pictured , which could have a heavy impact on gas prices for @entity32 consumers household bills : @entity34 signed a three - year deal for gas supply with @entity37 last february instead , professor @entity5 claimed that blocking oil exports to @entity20 and the @entity40 would encourage hardliners inside the @entity43 state to retaliate , adding : ‘ there could even be a @entity3 - type response from within @entity1			1
’ the @entity32 could face losing up to a half of its gas imports if @entity1 does carry through its threat to close a vital shipping route			1
@entity1 has threatened to block the @entity14 in retaliation against international sanctions imposed because of its nuclear development programme			1
closing the @entity14 would block a trade route through which 46 per cent of @entity32 's gas imports pass en route from @entity37 , while 84 per cent of the @entity32 's @entity58 imports use the same route			1
according to the @entity62 , the imports through the strait represent 15 per cent of @entity32 's total gas supply			2
the increasing stand - off in the @entity65 has caused several spikes in oil prices in recent weeks and a former military chief has warned that @entity32 would have to weather the economic fall - out should the closure occur			2
' i have no doubt at all that this would be the biggest problem for us , ' @entity71 , former head of the @entity72 and security adviser to @entity74 , told the @entity78			2
@entity32 has increasingly relied on gas imports from @entity37 since 2010 - increasing the supply by 67 per cent - with supply from @entity82 dropping 17 per cent and @entity84 supplies shrinking			2
from august to october last year , the most recent period for which the @entity62 has data , all the @entity32 ’s lng imports – or 46 per cent of its total gas demand – came from @entity37			0
in february 2011 @entity34 , the parent company of @entity34 , signed a three - year deal with @entity37 for @entity58 supply over the next three years			0
there were also hints that a 10 - year deal could be agreed			0
not just gas : oil ships such as these provide constant traffic through the @entity14 as it carries one - fifth of the world 's oil narrow options : this image of the @entity14 , taken from @entity103 's @entity102 , shows why the route is so important , as there is no alternative @entity32 's gas supply is at risk because it buys from such a narrow pool of suppliers and there is no viable export alternative for @entity37 than the @entity14 , which carries a fifth of the world ’s oil and one - third of its lng			1
a @entity62 spokesman said : ' we are aware of the importance of @entity14 , both in terms of oil and liquefied natural gas imports to the @entity32			1
' we are therefore working across @entity122 on this issue			0
relevant ministers have been briefed			0
' we have a variety of potential gas suppliers and energy sources should we need to draw upon them , including pipelines to mainland @entity130 and @entity82 , and our own @entity84			0
' the @entity32 has access to a wide variety of gas sources and routes , including production from the @entity32 @entity136 , imports from @entity82 and from the @entity138 , lng from global markets and gas storage			0
added complication : the energy crisis is not helped by march elections in , meaning @entity144 needs to appear tough ' in addition , at times of market tightness , mechanisms on the demand - side such as switching to coal in the power sector can be used to ensure demand and supply balance			0
' @entity32 's gas supply has shifted increasingly towards @entity154			0
it now accounts for around a fifth of @entity32 supply and that reliance is expected to grow			0
by 2015 the @entity32 is forecast to import about two - thirds of its gas , rising to about 80 per cent in 2020			0
though a potential closure would have a very heavy impact on @entity32 's gas supplies it would have less of an impact on the @entity32 's oil supply , with less than one per cent arriving by that route			0
a 2008 report by @entity168 listed the @entity14 as the world 's top ' choke point ' for oil supply			1
there has been strong momentum for energy sanctions since the publishing of a @entity177 watchdog report saying @entity1 appeared to have worked on designing an atom bomb			1
western countries suspect @entity1 is trying to develop nuclear weapons capability			1
@entity1 says it is only interested in nuclear technology for peaceful purposes such as generating electricity			1
@entity32 foreign secretary @entity184 said on sunday he was ' confident ' the 27 - member @entity40 would impose resounding sanctions on @entity1 's oil industry and possibly other sectors at an @entity40 foreign ministers meeting on january 23			1
mr @entity184 said : ' our sanctions are part of trying to get @entity1 to change course and to enter negotiations and we should not be deterred from implementing those			2
we will continue to intensify our own sanctions and those of the @entity40			0
' the issue is also being clouded by @entity1 's upcoming presidential elections in march , which means the government in @entity9 needs to be seen as acting strongly on these critical issues .			2

@entity1 probably wo *n't* blockade @entity14 , though , says expert
