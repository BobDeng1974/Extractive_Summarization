by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 09:15 est , 23 october 2012 one of the most memorable moments of last night 's final presidential debate was @entity4 's mocking comparison of @entity6 's foreign policy to the era of ' horses and bayonets '			1
the barb , which rapidly became popular on social networks , was intended to paint the @entity13 challenger as inexperienced and out of touch with the realities of modern military conduct			0
but the president 's mocking comment threw the spotlight on the fighting techniques - because both bayonets and horses have remained important parts of the @entity25 military right up to the present day			1
' the president replied : ' well , @entity42 , we also have fewer horses and bayonets , because the nature of our military 's changed			2
we have these things called aircraft carriers , where planes land on them			0
' we have these ships that go underwater , nuclear submarines			0
and so the question is not a game of @entity55 , where we 're counting ships			0
' the zinger instantly went viral on @entity58 and other networks , as @entity4 supporters took the opportunity to portray his opponent as old - fashioned and clueless about modern warfare			2
however , bayonets are still an integral item of military equipment			0
standard issue : the bayonet remains a crucial piece of equipment for @entity71 in use : @entity74 instruction remains part of basic training for @entity71 , and was part of @entity79 training until 2010 new model : the @entity82 bayonet has been issued to @entity71 since 2003 in the @entity71 , the bayonet is standard issue , and @entity71 are instructed in how to use the knives in hand - to - hand combat as part of their basic training			1
the current model of bayonet used , the @entity82 , which is designed to fit on the end of the @entity90 rifle , first entered service as recently as 2003			0
the wars in @entity95 and @entity96 have mostly relied on more hands - off techniques such as roadside bombs and aerial attacks , rather than hand - to - hand combat			2
however , @entity71 are nonetheless equipped for a knife fight - and four years ago , a @entity104 soldier won the @entity105 after using his bayonet to kill a @entity108 militant , having ordered his platoon to affix bayonets because it was ' good for morale '			2
in the @entity79 , bayonet use was part of basic training until 2010 , when it was replaced with more general tuition on the correct use of a knife			0
old - fashioned ? special forces troops entered @entity95 on horseback during the 2001 invasion heroic : the troops showed that horses can still be used in combat , though it may seem anachronistic for most soldiers , a bayonet or other type of blade is the second most important weapon , behind only the rifle			1
as well as being a combat weapon , bayonets are used as multi-purpose knives while troops are being deployed overseas			2
horses are less important to modern methods of fighting , but they have not yet been entirely phased out			0
in 2001 , the first @entity25 troops to enter @entity95 did so by riding into the country alongisde @entity25 's allies in the @entity139			1
meme : the debate exchange prompted @entity4 supporters to mock @entity6 via social media for many members of the special operations teams , it was the first time they had ever ridden a horse , but the remote desert landscape did not allow them to use more common methods of transport			1
the mission was not without its difficulties - one soldier was forced to ride with a broken back after his horse fell on top of him - but it was a success in the end			0
obviously , neither horses nor bayonets occupy the same central place in the warfare of 2012 as they did during @entity161 but despite what president @entity4 might suggest , both are still used as tools of battle to this day			1
video : horses and bayonets : @entity4 mocks @entity6 's military strategy			1

@entity4 mocked @entity6 's complaint about size of @entity39 fleet by comparing ship numbers to ' horses and bayonets '
but bayonets are still standard issue for @entity71 and used by some soldiers
first @entity25 troops in @entity95 entered on horseback in 2001
