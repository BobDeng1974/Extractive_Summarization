@entity0 , the boss of the international players ’ union , has criticised the @entity3 over their decision to cut the @entity5 in @entity6 to 10 teams , saying : ‘ the global game needs a global view			1
’ with the likes of @entity11 and @entity12 – two of the more engaging sides in this year ’s tournament – in danger of missing out on qualification in four years ’ time , the @entity3 have faced tough questions over their commitment to spreading the game beyond its 10 test - playing @entity21			1
but @entity23 ’s comments , part of a wide - ranging interview with @entity26 about some of the major issues faced by international cricket , carry particular significance : @entity32 , the @entity33 ’ @entity31 of which he is chief executive , represents the players unions in @entity6 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity0 , the @entity40 boss of the international players ’ union , says cricket needs a global view and not a 10 - game @entity5 that the @entity3 has planned for 2019 that will exclude the likes of @entity11 ( above ) fans of @entity12 , who have n't been disgraced in their first @entity5 in @entity36 and @entity38 in other words , he is speaking on behalf of the majority of the world ’s top cricketers			1
‘ @entity32 takes a global view on the game , ’ said @entity23			1
‘ one of the objectives must be to try to grow the global game			1
the opportunity for other countries to participate in the @entity5 , the pinnacle tournament , is important			2
‘ however , we do accept the challenge relating to the length of the event			0
we think we should look at reformatting the event , perhaps into four pools , or having a pre-qualifier			0
’ @entity23 , whose push for @entity32 to play a greater role in determining the game ’s future has not been helped by @entity71 ’s refusal to form their own players ’ union , said the format of future @entity74 should not be influenced by the tv - driven desire to guarantee as many group matches as possible for the @entity78			1
@entity12 and @entity38 playes come together after their @entity5 pool a match in @entity82 ‘ one can understand that from a commercial point of view , and from the point of view of satisfying the biggest cricket market , ’ he said			1
‘ but you ’ve got to balance against that the fact that a sporting event is a sporting event , and if a team performs poorly in a particular format , then that ’s how the results go			2
the growth of the game is equally important			0
‘ the @entity3 has 105 members – 10 @entity21 , and a number of competitive associate members			2
the important thing is that the body that administers the global game needs to have a global view			1
’ @entity23 , who also heads up the @entity40 players ’ association , questioned how associate nations were supposed to get exposure against the @entity21 when the international schedule is already full to bursting			2
@entity71 have n't got a players ' union which hinders the international union 's powers to push for an inclusive game he said : ‘ there ’s very little framework any more to the @entity119			1
it ’s not being governed by a set of principles which allows … cricket to have a greater context			0
it ’s a lot of individual agreements between countries , which are just plugged into a matrix			0
‘ it ’s a pity the world test championship has been shelved			0
the team rankings give some sort of context , but they ’re extremely difficult to understand			0
’ and @entity23 is concerned that the takeover of the @entity3 by the @entity78 , @entity6 and @entity36 boards last year will result in an increasingly unlevel playing field at international level			1
though the @entity3 have promised more funds to all @entity21 and the best six associate teams as a result of their latest broadcasting deal , many are worried that the @entity141 will pull away from the @entity142 because they will simply schedule more lucrative series against between themselves			2
under the old @entity119 , teams were obliged to play each other home and away every four years in series of at least two tests and three one - day internationals			0
now , the fixture list is drawn up on the basis of individual agreements between teams			0
‘ the fear is that the stronger countries will just play each other more and more , and the weaker countries will have less opportunity to play the stronger countries , ’ said @entity23			0
‘ the rich get richer , and the poor get poorer			0

the @entity3 has cut the @entity165 to be held in @entity6 to 10 teams
players unions from the top test playing nations call move short - *sighted*
@entity172 boss @entity0 said ' the global game of cricket needs a global view '
rather than less teams , they say the @entity5 's format should be *revisited*
a 10 - team @entity5 almost certainly means the likes of @entity11 wo n't be there
@entity32 represents players ' unions from most test - playing nations , not @entity71
