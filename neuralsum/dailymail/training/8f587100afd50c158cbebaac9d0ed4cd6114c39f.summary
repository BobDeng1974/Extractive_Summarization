shopping on @entity0 could damage your health according to new research by the @entity4 and @entity5			1
scientists found that healthy people exposed to the fumes of buses and taxis for just two hours suffered damage to their arteries			1
people with pre-existing respiratory complaints such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema saw their lung capacity reduced after breathing in the toxic traffic fumes			1
researchers found that standing for two hours on @entity0 in @entity20 could damage your health much of the damage is caused by nitrogen dioxide pollution which is produced mainly by diesel vehicles such as @entity20 buses and taxi cabs			1
scientist believe that microscopic carbon particles , produced by diesel vehicles , can pass through the lungs , into the blood , increasing the risk of a heart attack			1
during the summer , researchers from @entity33 in @entity20 discovered that @entity0 had the world 's highest recorded levels of nitrogen dioxide			1
it is believed that the shape of @entity0 , with tall buildings either side , traps in the deadly fumes			1
@entity43 , who worked on the study , told @entity45 : ' @entity47 obstruction and a stiffening of the arteries occurred in both the healthy volunteers and people with lung disease , even after limited exposure to diesel pollution			1
' on the hole , the major health risk is cumulative over a long period of time			0
@entity59 shoppers should n't panic , but it would be wise for people with chronic lung or heart disease to check the air pollution forecast and limit their exposure on very polluted days			1
' @entity66 , chief executive of the @entity67 said the study proved the need to reduce traffic pollution in order to protect people 's health			2
last month , the @entity74 found the @entity75 was in breach of an @entity78 law concerning air pollution in 16 cities			2
the court warned the government has until january 2015 to act , or face action			0
the fumes from diesel buses and taxis on @entity0 can harden the arteries , even in healthy people under existing plans , the worst areas - including @entity20 , @entity91 and @entity92 - would not meet the pollution limits until 2030 , campaigners say			1
@entity75 breached @entity78 targets in 2010 for levels of nitrogen dioxide , a gas particle from car engines and factories which causes breathing and heart problems			1
it is still nowhere near adequate levels , and has repeatedly asked to be granted extensions to the @entity78 deadline			0
the @entity108 court , which is based in @entity109 , ruled that the @entity75 ’s @entity110 now has jurisdiction over the matter and must order the government to take action to meet the legal limits in a much shorter time frame			0
the government is also facing a separate £ 300million fine for failing to meet the @entity78 ’s air quality directive on pollution			2
some 16 areas including @entity20 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and the @entity124 are currently in breach of the targets			0
the problem was dramatically illustrated in april when a thick smog enveloped the country , forcing people to stop exercising and schools to keep their children inside			2
environmental lawyers @entity135 , who brought the case against @entity139 , the government ’s environment department , said the ruling is likely to mean rolling out @entity20 ’s planned ‘ ultralow emissions zone ’ to cities across the country			0
the plan , drawn up by @entity145 , will mean charging diesel car owners £ 10 to enter the city centre and scrapping old taxis			2
@entity135 lawyer @entity149 said : ‘ thousands of people die because of air pollution every year			1
this ruling will save lives by forcing the government to finally take this issue seriously			0
’ @entity20 's @entity156 is barely visible due to the heavy pollution blanketing the capital shadow environment secretary @entity159 said : ‘ this @entity74 judgement is a damning indictment of the @entity163 - led @entity154 ’s total failure to tackle the @entity75 ’s air pollution			0
‘ air pollution is a serious public health issue facing our towns and cities , tens of thousands of lives are lost each year and yet @entity172 ’s government has done nothing to solve the problem			0
‘ the @entity74 has now demanded that the @entity75 take urgent action to address dangerous levels of air pollution			0
’ mp @entity177 , chair of the parliamentary @entity178 , added : ‘ ministers have complacently carried on with business as usual and put off serious efforts to deal with the problem for another decade			0
‘ it is not acceptable for ministers who live in leafy suburbs to tell people living next to busy roads in towns and cities that they have to wait until 2030 to breath clean air			2
’ a @entity139 spokesman said : ‘ air quality has improved significantly in recent years and average roadside concentrations of @entity196 levels have fallen 15 per cent since 2010			0
‘ we have built on this by committing £ 2 billion since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles , green transport initiatives and supporting local authorities to take action			0

volunteers suffered breathing problems in @entity0 air after two hours
researchers said the fumes from buses and taxis reduced lung capacity
nitrogen dioxide and carbon particles also *threatened* the lungs and heart
people with lung problems should avoid @entity0 on polluted days
