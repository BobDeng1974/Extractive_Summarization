the @entity136 says it has seen a @entity9 document showing that the @entity135 stated : ‘ news reports have linked @entity139 to the @entity140 ’ passport application affair and imply that he may have received payments			2
‘ investigations into credits in 1998 show in excess of £ 58k was paid into the savings account and over £ 24k into the current account			0
‘ these payments contain significant amounts of cash and do not appear to be salary payments			1
