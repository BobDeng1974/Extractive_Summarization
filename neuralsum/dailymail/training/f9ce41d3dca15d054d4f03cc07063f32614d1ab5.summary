the sight of a dazzling blue kingfisher plunging into the clear waters of a rural river , emerging moments later with a fish in its beak , is one of the greatest of all @entity9 wildlife spectacles			0
so what is this shyest of birds doing slumming it among discarded shopping trolleys on a concrete - sided river in @entity16 ? it has chosen this unlikely spot because it provides everything it needs to raise young birds			1
out on a limb : for years , @entity16 's @entity23 was an open sewer , but conservation work has encouraged wildlife like the kingfisher to return and fish stocks are healthy @entity30 perch : brightly coloured kingfishers rarely live longer than two years there ’s a place to nest ( inside a disused metal pipe ) , plenty of small fish to feed to the growing chicks and , most important , fresh water			1
these kingfishers , captured by photographer @entity40 in the bustling heart of our capital , are a tribute to the amazing turn - around in the fortunes of @entity9 ’s urban rivers over the past 50 years			1
within living memory , rivers such as the @entity23 in @entity16 were open sewers where it was impossible for wildlife to survive			2
today , thanks to a concerted clean - up , urban rivers teem with life			1
the most vulnerable of all @entity9 ’s birds , kingfishers live fast and die young : few survive beyond their second birthday			2
they are especially hard hit by changes in the weather , especially flash floods , which wash away nests in an instant			0
urban flight : cities offer warmth and abundant food - if not scenic beauty - for the birds pole position : the kingfishers on the @entity23 have raised six healthy chicks @entity74 and ice are bad news , too , and kingfishers are also in danger from predators such as the @entity81 mink , introduced to @entity9 in 1929			1
however , by nesting alongside urban rivers and canals , the birds are safe from the mink , which are kept away by the constant footpath traffic of cyclists , dog walkers and joggers			1
moreover , cities are several degrees warmer than the countryside , with the temperature raised by heat from vehicles and the sun ’s rays reflected from buildings			0
in winter , this keeps rivers and streams ice free — ideal for kingfishers			2
according to the @entity102 , there are fewer than 5,000 pairs breeding in @entity9 , so city - based animal welfare organisations have installed ‘ kingfisher banks ’ - artificial nest holes - where they can safely breed			0
the good news is that these particular kingfishers raised six healthy chicks , and they ’ve started on a second brood			0
hopefully next spring this new generation will be here raising a family of their own			0
concrete nest : local authorities are drilling holes to help the birds to breed			0

the @entity23 now offers an ideal locations for adult birds to raise chicks
