one of @entity1 's greatest poets was honored by the @entity2 in a star - studded ceremony on tuesday			1
@entity4 , the acclaimed author of such classics as @entity6 and @entity7 , which she read at @entity11 's inauguration in 1993 , was issued a forever stamp in honor of her many achievements and contributions			1
first lady @entity16 and @entity17 were just two of the big names in attendance for the unveiling which gave the public a first look at the stamp , which features a picture of @entity4 's face and one of her many memorable quotes			1
the problem however , is that the featured quote came from another author			2
what 's more , the @entity55 found proof of an interview in which @entity4 herself used the quote			2
@entity62 wrote in her 1967 book @entity63 of @entity65 ; ' a bird does n’t sing because he has an answer , he sings because it has a song			1
' a few years before this quote first appeared though in 1969 with the publication of @entity4 's aforementioned autobiography i know why the @entity74 , it was used in a children 's book by another @entity1 author			1
@entity62 , now 89 , wrote in her 1967 book @entity63 of @entity65 ; ' a bird does n’t sing because he has an answer , he sings because it has a song			1
' in a statement released shortly after the origin of the quote was revealed , @entity2 spokesperson @entity86 said ; ' @entity87 used her widely recognized quote to help build an immediate connection between her image and her 1969 nationally recognized autobiography , ‘ @entity93			2
' @entity86 later added in an email to the @entity55 that had they been aware of this fact they would have selected another of @entity4 's famous lines			0
@entity4 , who was born into poverty , holding down jobs as a fry cook , singer , and at one point even a prostitute , passed away last may			0
she was 86 - years - old at the time , and had written , among other works , seven autobiographies , countless poems , and numerous scripts for theater , television and film			0
she also continued to teach throughout her life , spending the last four decades of her life as a professor at @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118			0
as for @entity62 , she seems remarkably nonplussed about the entire incident			0
' i think it easily happens sometimes that people hear something , and it ’s kind of going into your subconscious and you do n’t realize it , ' she explained			0
there are no plans to remove the limited edition stamp at this time			0

a quote attributed to @entity4 on her commemorative stamp released by the @entity2 is actually that of another writer
' a bird does n't sing because it has an answer , it sings because it has a song , ' reads the stamp , a quote that has long been attributed to @entity4
@entity62 wrote the words in her 1967 book @entity63 of @entity65
@entity4 , the acclaimed author of such classics as i know why the @entity74 , was issued the forever stamp for her contributions to the arts
