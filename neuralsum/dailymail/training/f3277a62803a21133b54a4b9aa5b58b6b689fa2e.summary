by @entity0 follow @ @ martin_domin @entity1 has been left in the lurch again after @entity3 pulled out of their heavyweight rematch on saturday			1
@entity3 fractured his left hand during his final sparring session ahead of the @entity9 and @entity10 title clash in @entity11			1
it is the third time @entity1 has seen a domestic fight cancelled after @entity14 was twice forced to pull out of a contest last year through injury			2
as a result , 25 - year - old @entity1 has only fought once in the past 15 months and has seen his promising career stall			0
i ’m sorry for the fans but once my hand is healed and i ’m given the all - clear to train and punch again , i ’ll be working on the new date			0
‘ i was in fantastic shape and had a great training camp , probably the best so far in my career , and was looking forward to getting revenge on @entity1 , but that will have wait			0
‘ i ’m sorry to have to pull out on @entity1 , as i know that he had been training hard and it was going to be a great fight between two top athletes			2
i hope we can get it on again soon			0
’ intense workout : @entity1 , pictured in training on monday , was ready to take on @entity3 weights session : fury works on his strength and conditioning in the build up to his fight with @entity3 focused : fury will be disappointed at @entity3 's late withdrawal after preparing for his date in the ring @entity1 later tweeted : ' @entity3 is no better than @entity14 , a pure s * * * bag ! there is no injury , he dropped his balls			1
' promoter @entity68 insisted the fight will be rescheduled and that saturday ’s show will still go ahead , with middleweight @entity72 ’s @entity10 title fight with @entity73 topping the bill			0
@entity68 said : ‘ there ’s no way that @entity3 could fight with his hand fractured and there ’s no way i would let him get into the ring and fight with an injury like that			2
