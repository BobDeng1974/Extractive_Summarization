by @entity0 @entity1 is the ‘ goodest ’ country in the world , according to a new survey which measures what 125 nations contribute to the planet and humanity			1
the @entity9 made it to the seventh place in the overall index but was crowned as the best country in the world for its contribution in terms of technology and science			1
the @entity19 , conceived by policy adviser @entity20 , analyses 35 different types of data from the @entity23 , the @entity24 and other international organisations and @entity26			0
global contribution : @entity28 is the ' goodest ' part of the world as nine of the top 10 countries are in @entity28 , according to the @entity19 this includes information such as @entity39 , the number of refugees hosted , the amount of weapons exported and the number of @entity42 winners			1
this it the first time the @entity19 is published			0
countries are then ranked according to their contribution to science and technology , culture , international peace and security , world order , the planet and climate , prosperity and equality , and the health and well - being of humanity			1
maybe unsurprisingly , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 were the countries which contributed least to the global good			2
bottom of the list : war - torn @entity60 ( pictured ) along with @entity61 and @entity62 are the countries which contributed least to the global good mr @entity20 said the survey was not meant to name and shame nations or to give moral judgements , but to engage in a discourse about what is the role of countries in a global context			2
he said : ‘ the idea of the @entity19 is pretty simple ; to measure what each country on earth contributes to the common good of humanity , and what it takes away			2
’ the @entity82 , as might be expected , makes a collective contribution to humanity and the planet which is well in advance of any other region , while the @entity87 ranked 21st due to a poor record in terms of @entity90			0
mr @entity20 said he hopes the @entity19 will transform the way countries do business by encouraging them to think about the global impact of their actions			0
he hopes it will spark debate about what the purpose of a country is			0
he said : ‘ do they exist purely to serve the interests of their own politicians , businesses and citizens , or are they actively working for all of humanity and the whole planet ? ‘ the debate is a critical one , because if the first answer is the correct one , we 're all in deep trouble			0
’ ' goodest ' @entity116 country : @entity118 , at 26th place , is the only country on the continent to break into the top 30 outside of western @entity28 and the @entity123 - speaking world , the highest ranked country is @entity124 , which comes in at 22nd place , while @entity126 was ranked in 24th place			1

booming : @entity157 ranked 81st , well ahead of @entity160 at 107th place ( pictured : @entity162 in @entity163 ) mr @entity20 called for countries to stop behaving ‘ as if they are islands ’			0
he said : ‘ the whole world is connected as never before , yet we still treat countries as if each one was located on its own private planet			2
