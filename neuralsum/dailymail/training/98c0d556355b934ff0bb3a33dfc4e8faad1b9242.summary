a grandmother says she was left ' looking like a monster ' after a reaction to a lip gloss caused her lips to blister and break out in pus - filled sores			1
doctors thought @entity7 , 62 , from @entity8 , had developed a viral condition after huge cold sore - like lesions covered her lips			1

@entity7 , 62 , suffered an allergic reaction to her @entity15 lip gloss which caused her lips to blister , break out in pus - filled sores , and crack			1
she is pictured now ( left ) and after ( the reaction ) doctors thought mrs @entity7 had a virus causing her lips to crack , and she tried different medications to treat her painful lips ( pictured left and right )			1
she said she felt ' ugly and dirty ' and missed her 40th wedding anniversary as she could n't face leaving the house the grandmother - of - four , who works in a doctor 's surgery , never suspected her @entity15 lip gloss was to blame , having used the product before			1
after trying a plethora of different medicines , mrs @entity7 decided to stop using her ' @entity31 ' lip gloss in case it made it worse – and was amazed when her ' viral condition ' disappeared			1
but after months of agony it emerged the @entity39 cosmetics firm had changed the formula – adding a preservative called propyl gallate in the new tube mrs @entity7 ' daughter had bought for her			1
@entity45 then arranged for her to have tests with a dermatologist which revealed the allergy to propyl gallate , a preservative used to stop cosmetics reacting with oxygen and fats in food			1
the company has since sent her a letter apologising for the ' inconvenience ' and a free candle – and at mrs @entity7 ' request donated her refund to charity			1
mrs @entity7 , a mother - of - two , said : ' it 's a bit more than an inconvenience – and a candle just does n't cut it			1
' i missed my 40th wedding anniversary because i looked like a monster and just did n't want to go out			1
' it made me look ugly and dirty , especially when it went into black scabs			2
' i think other people should know about propyl gallate because it can cause such a severe reaction			0
' @entity77 is a preservative used in a wide range of cosmetics and beauty care products , including lipsticks , bath products , skin cleansing products , moisturisers , skin care products , makeup , self - tanning products , and sun cream			0
it is also used in foods like meat products , microwaveable popcorn , soup , chewing gum , mayonnaise and frozen meals			0
it has antioxidant properties , which means it helps stop oxygen molecules from mixing with the oil in food , causing the food to go rancid			0
in cosmetic products , it stops the oxygen mixing with the oil , which could change the colour and texture of the product , or cause the active ingredients in the formula to deteriorate			2
@entity45 said in a statement : ' consumer safety is our main priority			0
all cosmetic products placed on the @entity120 market are regulated by strict @entity122 laws ( the @entity123 1223/2009 )			0
' propyl gallate is not on the prohibited list nor is its use restricted in cosmetics			0
' it is not carcinogenic			0
it is a food additive ( @entity77 )			0
' we were sorry to learn of our consumer 's condition and were grateful that she had taken the time to return the product for analysis			2
' cases like these are fed into the industry scientific bodies to continue to inform research and regulation of this industry			0
' dr @entity145 , director general of the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) , the industry body that represent cosmetics firms , said : ' unfortunately , even with such comprehensive safeguards , it is not possible to avoid all possibility that someone somewhere might react to one of the ingredients			0
' such reactions are rare but nevertheless of concern and distressing for those affected			0
' this does not mean the product is unsafe but it does mean that anyone who has reacted to a product and knows which ingredient caused that reaction must avoid the same ingredient in any other cosmetic product as well			2
' this can be checked by consulting the ingredient list that must be available either on the label or , for small products , at the point of sale			2
' mrs @entity7 had used @entity15 lip gloss for years , but the company recently added propyl gallate - a preservative used in cosmetics - to the formula , which triggered an allergic reaction the news comes after @entity178 reported the case of @entity180 , 52 , who was left with red sores all over her face after using expensive beauty products from @entity184			1

the preservative was first approved for use in skincare in 2005			0
two studies presented at the @entity204 ’ conference in 2013 showed a sharp rise in reactions to @entity197 over the past three years			2
