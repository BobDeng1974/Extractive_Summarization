@entity0 and @entity1 have expressed growing concern about a possible @entity4 military strike against @entity5 over its nuclear programme			1
and this week the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) is to publish a damning report with ' compelling evidence ' that @entity5 is secretly building an arsenal of nuclear warheads			1
fresh details suggest that @entity5 could even be ' nuclear ready ' within months			1
and laying bare the disturbing extent of the country ’s atomic weapons programme will increase calls in the @entity4 for pre-emptive action against the @entity20 state			0
and that plays into the hands of @entity24 prime minister @entity23 , who is said to be pushing for an airstrike on @entity5 ’s nuclear facilities			1
the @entity5 nuclear power plant in @entity28 , southern @entity5 - a site that may be targeted in a mooted military strike however , @entity5 has threatened to retaliate by blocking the @entity30 , severing 40 per cent of the world ’s oil supplies			1
@entity0 's foreign minister today became the latest critic of any proposed action against @entity5 warning it would be ' a very serious mistake fraught with unpredictable consequences '			1
@entity37 added : ' the only path for removing concerns is to create every possible condition ' to resume the talks between @entity5 and six world powers , which broke down last december			0
@entity1 has also expressed concern about a military strike against @entity5 , but has also urged @entity45 not to be confrontational with the @entity7			2
@entity46 and @entity47 have signaled concern that the report will box @entity5 into a corner and dim any chance of diplomacy resolving the dispute , which has the potential to spark a wider conflict in the @entity56			0
concerns : @entity0 's foreign minister @entity37 , right , warned any action against @entity5 would be ' a very serious mistake			1
' @entity1 's foreign minister @entity61 , left , has also expressed concern ' the @entity0 in particular have been lobbying quite intensively , ' one senior @entity64 diplomat said			1
meanwhile former @entity4 secretary of state @entity65 has weighed in to slam @entity5 saying the @entity4 should consider even tougher penalties against the @entity5 government and ' be doing everything we can to bring it down			1
' @entity70 told @entity72 's @entity71 that the @entity4 should never take the option of military force off the table when it comes to dealing with @entity5			2
the current @entity5 government is trying to obtain a nuclear weapon and has repressed its own people , she said			2
' the regime has absolutely no legitimacy left , ' she added			0
@entity24 president @entity83 has also expressed a determination to launch a military strike against @entity5			2
new @entity87 evidence suggesting @entity5 was helped by several foreign scientists could provide further headache for @entity5 's president @entity90 ' the possibility of a military attack against @entity5 is now closer to being applied than the application of a diplomatic option , ' he said over the weekend			1
' i estimate that intelligence services of all these countries are looking at the ticking clock , warning leaders that there was not much time left , ' he added			0
@entity103 candidate @entity102 , last week came out to back an @entity24 air strike on @entity5			0
the @entity106 governor said he would support @entity24 on the matter if there is proof @entity45 is moving closer to having a nuclear weapon			0
the news comes as a former @entity113 weapons expert and scientists in @entity115 and @entity116 are all believed to have aided @entity5 in its nuclear quest , according to the @entity87			1
former @entity113 weapons scientist @entity118 allegedly taught @entity5 how to build high - precision detonators that could trigger a chain reaction , according to @entity87 evidence			1
@entity118 was believed to have been contracted by @entity5 's @entity122 , linked to the country 's nuclear programme , in the mid 1990s			2
he allegedly gave lectures and shared research on developing and testing bombs that @entity5 then incorporated into their warhead design , according to @entity130 sources with access to @entity7 's files			0
however , while @entity118 acknowledged his role he also said he believe his work was limited to assisting civilian engineering projects , the sources added			0
there is also no evidence that @entity0 knew of @entity118 's @entity5 activities			1
weapons experts added that @entity5 relied on foreign scientists for mathematical formulas and codes , some of which may have come from @entity116			1
the design for a neutron initiator by father of @entity115 's nuclear programme , @entity150 , was also discovered in @entity5 , sources said			2
the latest intelligence provided to @entity87 nuclear officials , due for publication on wednesday and obtained by the @entity130 , suggests former @entity113 weapons scientist @entity118 allegedly taught @entity5 how to build high - precision detonators that could trigger a chain reaction during the mid 1990s			1
' but it makes clear the @entity5 want to be able to build such weapons quickly if need be			0
and thanks to outside help , the @entity5 are now on ' the threshold ' of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on top of a ballistic missile , says the study			2
one key technical breakthrough , say the @entity7 ’s intelligence sources , is that @entity5 has learnt how to design a device known as an @entity170 generator			2
it added there was also evidence to suggest other precision technology linked to experts in @entity115 and @entity116 had helped advance @entity5 's nuclear capabilities			1
@entity5 ’s foreign minister and former nuclear official , @entity179 , told the @entity180 : ' let them publish and see what happens , ' adding that the uproar over the country 's nuclear programme was ' 100 per cent political ' and that the @entity7 is ' under pressure from foreign powers			1
' @entity5 president @entity90 said on sunday the @entity4 feared @entity5 's growing military power because it is now able to compete with @entity24 and the @entity188			1
' yes , we have military capabilities that are different from any other country in the region , ' he said			0
' @entity5 is increasing in capability and advancement and therefore we are able to compete with @entity24 and the @entity188 and especially the @entity4			0
' ' the @entity4 fears @entity5 's capability			2
@entity5 will not permit ( anyone from making ) a move against it			0
' proof : a test - fire launch of a short - range missile in @entity5			2
the @entity87 now has a ' compelling case ' that @entity5 is building an arsenal of nuclear weapons @entity5 is conducting its secret nuclear programme at the @entity206 military base , near @entity45 , according to sources close to the @entity7 ( @entity7 )			1
@entity5 has allegedly carried out experiments in the final , critical stage for developing nuclear weapons , including explosions real and simulated			1
these have been carried out in a bus - sized container spotted on satellite photos , according to reports			0
@entity4 intelligence agencies are thought to have believed the base is suitable for developing nuclear weapons for around eight years			0
the @entity5 have rejected an @entity7 request to visit @entity206 in the past , arguing the @entity7 rules allowed it to deny such visits to military bases			2
now the site is under scrutiny again as a suspected location for covert nuclear activity			0
one part of the @entity7 's report is thought to reinforce concerns that @entity5 continued its nuclear programme after 2003 - the year that @entity4 intelligence agencies believed it had bowed to international pressures to halt experiments			1
one @entity5 document suggests scientists had been discussing plans to start a four - year study of neutron initiators beginning in 2007 - four years after the 2003 deadline , according to sources			1
' the programme never really stopped , ' @entity240 , a former @entity87 weapons inspector who has seen the intelligence files said according to the @entity130			0
' after 2003 , money was made available for research in areas that sure look like nuclear weapons work but were hidden within civilian institutions , ' he added			0
@entity45 denies secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons , insisting it is enriching uranium for reactors to generate electricity			0
but @entity5 has become increasingly belligerent in recent weeks and tensions are continuing to mount over its ambitions			0
the country 's history of concealing sensitive nuclear activity and its refusal to suspend work that can potentially yield atomic bombs have already been punished by four rounds of @entity87 sanctions , and separate @entity4 and @entity265 punitive steps			0
earlier this week , it was revealed @entity267 was drawing up contingency plans for any military action			1
commanders were working out how to deploy @entity272 submarines equipped with @entity274 cruise missiles in case president @entity275 decides to launch missile strikes against @entity5 bases			0
@entity24 ’s prime minister @entity23 and defence minister @entity278 are reportedly agitating for pre-emptive action			0
mr @entity23 is seeking @entity281 support for an attack and earlier this week @entity24 test - fired a new long - range missile .			0

fears mount that @entity5 could be ' nuclear ready ' in a matter of months
@entity87 intelligence suggests @entity5 was helped by foreign experts - including rogue @entity0 scientist
@entity0 foreign minister says any military action would be a ' serious mistake '
@entity65 : ' we must do everything we can to bring @entity5 down '
@entity90 remains *defiant*
