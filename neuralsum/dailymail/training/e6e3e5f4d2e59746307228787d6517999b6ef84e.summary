by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 07:08 est , 30 august 2012 a romantic message - in - a - bottle discovered by a mother and daughter at a @entity5 beach has sparked a mystery about whether it could have travelled 5,000 miles across the seas from @entity8			1
@entity10 , 41 , and daughter @entity9 , four , from @entity11 , near @entity12 , were scouring @entity13 when they came across an old glass bottle sticking out of the sand containing a note inside written in @entity18			0
now the family are trying to work out if the letter has managed the extraordinary journey across the @entity22 , into the @entity23 and through both the @entity24 and the @entity24 's before washing up on the shores of @entity26			0
the love letter was found by mother and daughter , @entity10 , 41 , and @entity29 , four , from @entity11 , while they were beachcombing it is unclear when the letter was sent off , as it was written on @entity33 , or @entity33 as it is more traditionally known , which falls on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month			1
while the letter bears the date in line with the lunar calendar - july 7 , 2012 - it could have been sent off as recently as six days ago if it followed the modern calendar , which celebrated the occasion on august 23			1
whether the message has travelled thousands of miles from @entity8 or whether it was penned by a love - struck pair much closer to home remains a mystery			1
but for @entity10 it does n't matter - she was still excited to read about the @entity8 love story after having it translated			1
she said : ‘ i really do hope that it is from @entity8 but even it is from nearer to home , it ’s still a lovely gesture and an inspiring find			1
it ’s a love story regardless of where it came from			1
’ @entity10 , who runs a beach art business in @entity11 , added : ‘ i ’m always at the beach looking for bits of driftwood but i ’ve never come across anything like this before			0
. did the message travel across the @entity22 , into the @entity23 and through both the @entity24 and the @entity24 's before washing up on the shores of @entity65 ? a map shows the ocean currents which would have directed the bottle from @entity8 to @entity26 ‘ we saw the bottle sticking out of the sand and just thought it was junk that someone had left behind ‘ but after picking it up i noticed there was a piece of brown paper rolled up inside and there was some foreign writing on it			1
‘ we quite excitedly took it home and carefully uncorked the bottle and took out the sheet of paper using some tweezers			0
‘ we knew it was @entity8 , but we had no idea what it said			1
’ unable to read the @entity18 text , @entity10 turned to the internet and her @entity92 friend , @entity91 , whose daughter attended a @entity8 school in @entity94			2
several hours later @entity91 returned with the news that it was in fact a love letter			2
the translated letter reads : ‘ @entity98 : @entity24 , i hope no - one will get this bottle , as we just wish you can hear our voice , and get your blessing			0
the bottle contained a letter written in @entity18 that the mother and daughter asked a friend to translate the letter which said it was sent on @entity33 revealed a passionate love story ‘ today is the @entity8 @entity33 , we pray that our relationship will last forever and we will have a long happy life together			1
' @entity10 said : ‘ it sounds to me like the couple are in love but can not be together so they have sent the message to tell the world of their love			2
‘ i ’m blown away by it to be honest - it ’s incredible that it has travelled all this way			2
’ in may 2008 , a message in a bottle turned up on a @entity127 beach after completing a 4000 - mile sea journey from the @entity129			0
the bottle was cast afloat on june 26 , 2006 , by @entity131 holidaymaker @entity130 and found by @entity132 on @entity133 , @entity134			0
in august 2008 , @entity135 was reunited with a message in a bottle he launched into the sea from @entity139 aged 11 in 1985			0
it was found at @entity141			0
the translated message - in - a - bottle ... @entity98 : @entity24 , i hope no - one will get this bottle , as we just wish you can hear our voice , and get your blessing			0
‘ today is the @entity8 @entity33 , we pray that our relationship will last forever and we will have a long happy life together			1
‘ we declare our love and that we are the only one in each other ’s life			2
‘ though the person who picks up this bottle , in a different country using a different name , it ’s one world			0
‘ so please make a voice about our relationship and tell everyone about it			0
today can you please be our witness that our love will last forever , two people , two hearts but one life			2

love story could have travelled 5,000 miles from @entity8
it could have been sent as little as six days ago on @entity33
