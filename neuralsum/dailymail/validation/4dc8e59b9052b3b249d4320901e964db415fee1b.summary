a popular @entity1 reality television show featuring celebrities paired with animals has been criticised by animal rights activists for its ' cruel ' tasks			1
@entity8 's animal reality show ' @entity6 ' - where stars perform tasks with animals in a @entity13 zoo - became an instant hit when 20 million people tuned into the first episode			1
but the weekly show , which saw a chimpanzee start throwing things and in clear distress when separated from his son , has caused uproar amongst animal rights groups			2
unnatural : a young orangutan is dressed in human clothes for the hit realilty show in @entity13 an elephant is given a pedicure by @entity1 actor @entity31 and a chimpanzee is forced to wear a @entity34 costume , in some of the show 's more unusual scenes , dubbed ' cruel ' by experts talking to @entity38			1
wildlife experts argue the programme is exploiting the animals , with many reacting in ways that show they are stressed			2
cruel : @entity1 actor @entity31 gives an elephant a pedicure in a bizarre task in a @entity1 reality show one expert , miss @entity48 , said that people are mistaking the creature 's distressed reactions as cute			1
for example , a chimpanzee that appears to be ' grinning ' is actually showing signs of of ' anxiety , fear and threat '			0
pictures which show a young orangutan being dressed in human clothes could lead to alienation with other orangutans likely to ignore it , she warned			1
one part of the show saw a celebrity taking a young chimpanzee to ' find its @entity69 ' which led to the father suddenly becoming emotional and violent			0
the creatures are known to chase , stomp and bite unknown chimpanzees or even commit infanticide , leading to worries about the impact the tasks are having on the wild animals			2
angry : an adult male chimpanzee became emotional and violent during a game called ' find its @entity69 ' where it was separated from its baby heartless : a young chimp is dressed in clothes while an elephant received a pedicure as part of the ' reality ' tv show making waves in @entity13 producers have also been accused of courting disaster by placing potentially dangerous animals including lions , elephants and zebras alongside inexperienced celebrity zookeepers			1
@entity99 , deputy head of the @entity100 , said animals should not be used for the sake of entertainment and called for tougher legislation			0
' we can not use our emotions to design and manipulate the animals , animals are not there to be harassed for the entertainment of people , ' he said			0
' we should not start from the emotional needs of ourselves or for effect or for ratings of the show to interfere with the lives of animals			2
' when they see these strangers , they might become afraid and take action because of the stress , which is very dangerous to human beings , ' said wildlife activist @entity124 , from @entity125 , a @entity127 - based campaigning group			0
she complained animals were being forced to live side - by - side with those from different continents with how orangutans , which are native to @entity134 , put next to baby chimpanzees , which hail from @entity137			2
she said there would be little left of the show if the inappropriate parts were lost and was particularly concerned about the unnatural and stressful tasks for the creatures such as making lions socialise with celebrities and having chimpanzees go clothes shopping			1
critics also argue it is setting a bad example when in january , the @entity151 issued a notice , forbidding tourists to have close contact with endangered wild animals			0
not babies : critics have hit out at the unnatural tasks animals are being forced to do like chimps being taken shopping , pictured above it follows a trip by the @entity164 to @entity13 earlier this month where he wanted to highlight the fight to conserve and save endangered species in the country			1
but the makers of the show hit back , saying it was fully complicit with the laws of the state a spokesman said : ' we strictly abide by all laws and regulations set out by the state			0
' contact with the animals is a serious issue and when we were creating the show , we did so with the knowledge of the laws and regulations			0
' it went on to say that the regulations set by the @entity151 were referring to ' rare and endangered wild animals ' .			0

20 million tune in for first episode of reality show ' @entity6 '
