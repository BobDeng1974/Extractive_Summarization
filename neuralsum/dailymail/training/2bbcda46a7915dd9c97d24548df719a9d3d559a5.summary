by @entity0 published : 04:41 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 10:12 est , 14 november 2012 a @entity2 mathematician claims to have come up with a new ' third way ' to board a plane which could end the unseemly scrum of eager holidaymakers desperate to reach their destination			1
dr @entity8 of @entity9 in @entity10 said while previous research had offered solutions to luggage congestion , routing and runway scheduling , his was the first to look at boarding			1
he said that while the number of passengers travelling by air has leapt up , the increase in supply of airline transportation has not kept pace with demand			2
easy boarding : a @entity2 mathematician claims to have modelled the perfect ' third way ' for boarding an aircraft , which he claims could help save airlines money ' thus , in practice , certain conflicts between supply and demand often occur , leading to airline congestions , passenger - luggage congestions and mixed traffic problems , ' he said			1
dr @entity8 and team from @entity9 and @entity40 in @entity41 created mathematical models to compare three styles of boarding strategy			1
these included boarding completely at random , the current system of assigned seating , and a new way taking into account passengers ' individual characteristics like maximum speed and luggage			2
' each passenger has their own individual properties , ' dr @entity8 told @entity56			2
' for example , each passenger ’s luggage has a different attribution and thus has different influences on boarding behaviour ; the time that the passenger ’s ticket is checked at the gate is different ; the time that the passenger deals with his or her carried luggage is different ; seat conflicts have different effects on the passenger			1
each passenger has a different optimal speed , maximum speed and safe distance			0
' fear of maths can activate regions of the brain linked with the experience of physical pain , a study has found			0
the higher a person ’s anxiety of a maths task , the more it increases activity in regions of their brain associated with visceral threat detection , and often the experience of pain itself , according to researchers @entity94 and @entity96 , from the @entity97 , in the journal @entity99			0
the authors say that previous research has shown that other forms of psychological stress , such as social rejection or a traumatic break - up , can also elicit feelings of physical pain			0
findings showed , unsurprisingly , that allowing passengers to board at random was the most inefficient method , leading to naughty travellers queue jumping , congestion in the aisles and jams before the gate and between the gate and the plane			1
the currently used method - boarding by assigned seating - was better			2
however it was still inefficient since only passengers in the front of the queue could reach their seats at ' maximum speed ' and seat conflicts occurred			1
dr @entity8 's new way was proved to be optimal			0
this included assigning seat numbers based on passengers ' optimal speed , the properties of their hand luggage and tickets checked automatically with electronic equipment at the gate			2
when passengers boarded the plane this way , according to the model , there was no congestion , jams , overtaking , queue jumping , seat conflict or wasted time			1
however , questions remain as to how effective such a method would be in practice			0
@entity152 , a writer for @entity153 , notes : ' airlines could easily work out how carry - on luggage correlates with boarding speed and just add an extra weigh - in to factor how it affects seat allocation , for instance , while walking speed could be guesstimated as a function of age			1
how well that would work , though , is another question entirely			0
' add to the mix that it would mean that airlines would have to actively profile their customers — something many people would n’t be too happy with			0
' dr @entity8 is yet to find an airline to put the theory into practice but said he is open to collaborations to make his ' third way ' a travel reality			0
findings were published in the journal @entity178			0

@entity2 mathematician claims to be the first to model different boarding strategies
he claims his ' third way ' could end congestion , jams , overtaking , queue jumping , seat conflict and wasted time
