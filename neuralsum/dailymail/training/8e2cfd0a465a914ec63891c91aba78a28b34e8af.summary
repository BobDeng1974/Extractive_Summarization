lions may be the kings of the jungle but this one has come over a little bashful all of a sudden			2
covering his eyes with an enormous paw , the lion was either finding the intense @entity8 heat in @entity9 too much , or he was feeling camera shy			1
the retiring lion then settled down to keep his cub company in the undergrowth as the sun went down , but always kept an careful eye out for predators or potential dinner			1
no photos please : this lion covers his face with a giant paw to play hide and seek - or the photographer 's attention was proving too much for him the lion 's hide and seek moment was captured up close by amateur photographer @entity29 in @entity30 , near the borders of @entity9 , @entity32 and the @entity33			1
mr @entity29 , who runs a gorilla trekking lodge in @entity9 , said : ' he covered his eyes as if to hide himself			1
it was a really unique moment			0
' seeing a lion , known for their ferociousness , looking vulnerable has captured people 's imaginations			0
' the reactions to the shy lion picture have been overwhelmingly positive , ' he said			0
resting with his cub : the lion shares a tender moment in the wilds of @entity9 , @entity48 majestic : keeping an eye out , the lion 's beautiful mane took on a reddish colour in the sunset contrary to popular belief , lions spend large parts of their day resting , conserving energy ready to hunt prey			1
males like this one can grow up to around six - and - a - half foot in length and weigh between 265 and 420 lbs. this lion was careful to lie down behind his cub , keeping an eye out to protect him from harm			2
he will also have a responsiblity to protect his whole pride 's territory , which can stretch over some 100 square miles			0
in recent years , @entity9 has had to bring lions and rhinos over from @entity48			2
their numbers of lions , as well as other wildlife , had become dangerously low after widespread poaching			0
the wars of the 1990s had a devastating effect on the wildlife as animals were hunted in ever larger numbers .			0
