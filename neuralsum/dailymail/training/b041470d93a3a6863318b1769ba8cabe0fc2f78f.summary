by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 11:48 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 17:04 est , 24 june 2013 the @entity3 turned the screw on @entity5 over spending last night , releasing the infamous letter admitting there was ‘ no money ’ left at the 2010 election			1
cabinet office minister @entity10 made public the glib note , left by outgoing treasury chief secretary @entity12 for his successor			1
it states : ‘ dear chief secretary , i ’m afraid there is no money			0
kind regards – and good luck ! @entity12			2
’ damaging : @entity5 's @entity12 sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the @entity21 in 2010 the letter has haunted @entity5 , allowing @entity24 and @entity25 ministers to prove the nation ’s coffers were empty			1
on the eve of the latest round of spending cuts , the letter from former treasury minister @entity12 has been pictured for the first time			1
consisting of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of the nation ’s finances , only a glib ‘ good luck ’ to whoever was left to clear up the economic mess			0
the letter , written in blue ink on government note paper , was opened by @entity25 @entity10 who became chief secretary to the treasury when the coalition was formed			1
mr @entity10 mentioned its existence within days of taking office , claiming he assumed the envelope would offer advice on how to conduct himself in government			1
but he refused to bow to calls from former @entity24 spin doctor @entity55 to release the actual letter publicly			0
as he made the letter public for the first time , mr @entity10 claimed he had not deliberately intended for it to be made public three years ago			2
regret : @entity5 's @entity12 has said he will wish he had never written the not for the rest of his life @entity25 mr @entity10 said : ‘ i did n’t set out to embarrass @entity12 , but he left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the @entity21 when he left it			1
‘ i think it is refreshing that a @entity5 politician has been prepared to admit that			2
’ @entity67 rounded on mr @entity10 , with former minister @entity68 accusing him of behaving ‘ like the class swot ’			2
mr @entity10 told @entity70 about when he opened it : ' i did n’t know who it was from			2
it looked a bit odd			0
i really did n’t regard as a big thing '			0
' i only mentioned it almost by accident at a press conference that we held a few days into the government , not expecting – rather naively – the huge reaction that it got			2
' within minutes of mentioning it in front of a media audience , and without alerting the chancellor of the exchequer about its existence let alone that i was going to mention it , the whole story suddenly went stratospheric			0
' money : @entity25 @entity10 revealed the existence of the note within days of becoming a @entity21 minister , working with @entity24 chancellor @entity96 the decision to publish the note ahead of wednesday ’s @entity100 will seriously sour relations with the @entity5			1
the @entity25 have hoped to reposition themselves as more economically competent than @entity5 , and the note ’s release suggests they will use it to hammer home the message in the run up to the 2015 election			1
@entity25 business minister @entity108 said today that the letter was a ' stark reminder that @entity5 ca n't be trusted with the economy '			1
earlier this month mr @entity12 , now @entity5 ’s shadow work and pensions secretary , admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life			1
‘ it was a very foolish thing to do , ’ he told the @entity116 magazine			0
‘ i suppose i did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private			0
‘ there 's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s			0
i felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage			0
’ mr @entity10 was forced to resign as chief secretary to the treasury - essentially deputy to chancellor @entity96 - after just 17 days in office after revelations about his expenses			0
in september last year he returned to government as schools minister , with a roving brief across @entity137 .			0
