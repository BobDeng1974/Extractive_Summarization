though the marginalized adolescent brainiacs have oft been encouraged that success later in life can be their best revenge , a team of researchers found that social success in high school is actually key to making it in the real world			1
a team of researchers tracked a group of students from high school to adulthood and found that those who were rated as popular retained their appeal in the marketplace and earned an average of 2 per cent more than their geeky counterparts			1
the ruling class : popularity , social graces , wealth and intelligence are key ingredients to becoming a high school brahmin			1
pictured , the social elite as represented by the cast of @entity38 authors @entity39 , from the @entity40 at @entity41 , @entity42 from @entity44 's @entity43 , and @entity47 researchers @entity45 and @entity48 have concluded that over the years , being cool in school will pay off			1
' we investigate these questions [ about the impact of high school social standing ] using an objective measure of popularity derived from sociometric theory : the number of friendship nominations received from schoolmates , interpreted as a measure of early accumulation of personal social capital , ' wrote the academics who authored the working paper , published in october			1
in the scientific quest to understand the impact of a high schooler 's social standing , researchers looked at @entity71 's @entity70 , a survey that has tracked a group of students in the @entity71 who graduated in 1957			2
the study has monitored this population of roughly 10,000 and reviewed their progress over the course of 35 years			1
after tracking this group through the years , the cool kids still stood out among the crowd , earning an estimated 2 per cent more than their less cool compadres			2
so many friends , so little time : @entity85 success in high school actually yields results in the real world			1
the ultimate cool kids from the 1995 film @entity91 , actresses @entity93 ( left ) and @entity94 ( right ) nerd power : the socially marginalized actually end up earning less than their popular counterparts			2
pictured , the cast of the 1984 college comedy , @entity99 to measure popularity , researchers had respondents list three students they considered to be their closest friends			2
researchers reviewed the answers and the names most frequently listed were considered to be the most popular from the group			2
' popularity as measured by the number of friendship nominations that the student receives from his school mates has a sizable effect ... consistent with our view , we interpret our measure of popularity as a measure of the stock of social skills of a particular individual , ' the researchers wrote			1
' if @entity123 nominates @entity124 as his friend , he reveals his affection towards @entity124			0
in receiving a claim of friendship , @entity124 is socially approved by @entity123			0
we can then distinguish students on the basis of the number of friendship nominations they give			1
' they found some trends among this elite group			0
the cool kids tended to come from ' warm family environments , ' they actually excelled at school and contrary to conventional wisdom that being brainy is a turn off , intelligence was part of their allure			0
the research also found that if an individual moved from the 20th percentile of popular to the 80th percentile , that could provide a salary that was 10 per cent higher , over the course of 40 years			2
popularity was found to be a key factor in this determination , even after accounting for a person 's family background , school quality , cognitive ability and adult personality traits			0
the popularity factor seemed to give a student a leg up in the real world because it was the training needed ' to be socially adequate for the successful performance of their adult roles , ' the authors concluded			2
from glum to glam : @entity168 ( left , as a child ) has openly detailed her awkward and nerdy childhood and turned the experience into comedy gold			0
the ' @entity174 ' star ( right ) on the red carpet in september at the @entity176 inspiration : @entity168 relied on her experience as a nerd to pen the script for the hilarious comedy ' mean girls , ' ( from left to right ) actresses @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 but an awkward adolescence can actually be a badge of honor in some circles			0
for those in showbiz and comedy , many have found success in coming clean about their geeky phase			0
former ' @entity199 ' star , actress and screenwriter @entity168 has channeled her embarrassing early years into much of her material and has wrote extensively about being an outcast and a late bloomer			0
@entity168 , 42 , was inspired by her experience to adapt @entity204 's book ' @entity205 ' into the script for ' mean girls , ' the hilariously popular 2004 high school comedy starring @entity186 about the high school pecking order			1
in her book ' @entity211 , ' she even boasts about her nerdy childhood and jokes about how that experience gave her a biting wit to laugh at the @entity216			0
late bloomer : actress @entity217 ( left as a child ) has blossomed into a successful star ( right , at the @entity220 in january ) and pokes fun of her childhood dorkiness in her comedy material similarly , @entity217 , who wrote for and appeared in ' @entity224 ' and now stars in @entity226 's ' the @entity225 , ' has joked about her youthful days of being quiet , studious and isolated			0
the 33 - year - old actually credits her dorkiness with helping her later in life , in her new book ' is @entity231 ? ( and @entity232 )			0
' ' teenage girls , please do n’t worry about being super popular in high school , or being the best actress in high school , or the best athlete			1
' ' not only do people not care about any of that the second you graduate , but when you get older , if you reference your successes in high school too much , it actually makes you look kind of pitiful , like some babbling old @entity244 character with nothing else going on in her current life			1
what i ’ve noticed is that almost no one who was a big star in high school is also big star later in life			1
for us overlooked kids , it ’s so wonderfully fair , ' she promises			0
so there is hope ... watch @entity217 talk about her childhood			0
