by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 06:50 est , 10 july 2013 these are the first pictures of a female @entity4 aristocrat 's bespoke dentures - made for her by @entity5 from platinum and gold			1
the mystery noble woman 's remains were found in a church near @entity11 during an archeological dig ahead of planned renovations - but it was the contents of her glinting jaw that astonished experts			1
her identity remains a puzzle and for now she is known only as @entity20 luxury dental work : these are the first pictures of a female @entity4 aristocrat 's bespoke dentures - made for her by @entity5 from platinum and gold she died aged between 50 and 60 in all probability in the opening years of the 20th century , before the @entity27 engulfed her country , but scientists hope to be able to discover her real name with further research			1
her expensive tastes are already clear from what has been dubbed ' history 's most jaw - dropping jaw '			1
professor @entity36 , deputy head of the @entity37 for @entity38 , said : ' we were about to finish our work when one member of our team assistant professor @entity42 shouted : ' @entity36 , come here ! look what i 've found ! '' his excited voiced echoed through tumbledown @entity47 village church , badly damaged during fighting in the @entity48 , and dedicated to @entity50 saint @entity49			1
discovery : the mystery noble woman 's remains were found in a church near @entity11 during an archeological dig ahead of planned renovations - but it was the contents of her glinting jaw that astonished experts unknown : her identity remains a puzzle and for now she is known only as @entity65 ' he was holding a skull			1
after removing the mud , we immediately spotted a shiny denture in the upper jaw , obviously not a simple one but made from precious metals			0
' spectral and dental expertise proved it was a unique denture , produced around the beginning of the 20th century from gold and platinum by the @entity5 company			1
' dental experts from @entity79 established that ' this denture is a high quality product made by jewellery dental prosthetic manufactory of the @entity83 , which was based in dental department of @entity85 ' in @entity11 , then the capital of tsarist @entity4			1
' multi-layer china dentures were produced in @entity88 and supplied to @entity4 from the middle of 19th century until the time of the @entity91			2
' the mixture of metals in the denture - a high alloy of platinum with silver and copper in the dental plate , and a high alloy of gold with platinum and copper in the denture clasps , points to the fact that it was produced at the end of 19th or beginning of 20th century '			1
this is because before 1891 a mixture of gold and iridium was used for clasps in @entity4			0
' ' we quickly realised the skull belongs to a noble woman , ' said professor @entity36 , who was called in by local @entity117 priest @entity116			1
buried : deformed lead sarcophagus which house @entity65 's body inside ' but we have not found anything about her in the archives yet			1
this is why we call her @entity20 ' maybe she was from the @entity127 or @entity128 families , or from some other noble and well known family in this area			2
' we have very good hopes of identifying @entity20 i believe there could be just a couple of dozen women at the time who could have afforded such a denture			0
' unfortunately , her skull was in a bad condition and almost fell into pieces in our hands , so we have little chance to reconstruct her face and compare with existing portraits which is often helpful			0
still , we do not lose a hope and will continue working to identify her from material in the archives			0
' other remains dug up from the historic church have been identified as members of the @entity153 - a rich noble family from the @entity155 who were much earlier close to @entity156			1
archive evidence backed by @entity158 shows that the skeletons were those of @entity161 , his wife @entity162 and their 12 - year - old son			2
uncovered : the @entity164 in @entity47 village in @entity11 region where the denture was found a surviving button on the boy 's clothing shows he was a military cadet in the mid- 19th century			1
the church records were lost perhaps during the @entity172 in 1917 and the area were later overrun by the @entity174			2
' we found four graves , some of them were partly open and , unfortunately , destroyed , ' said the professor			2
' there were a lot of @entity88 bullets and helmets around			0
but we ca n't exclude the possibility that the graves were touched before the second world war			0
' there is also the fifth grave there but it is well protected with concrete cover and we have not examined it yet			0
' the priest hopes that the unusual find in the church will lead to discovery of the identity of @entity65 and help to raise funds for a full - scale renovation of the historic building which was badly damaged by @entity88 shooting during the @entity48			1
' i believe there could be just a couple of dozen women at the time who could have afforded such a denture ' professor @entity36 archeologists also found frescoes , old clothes and utensils			2
the church was associated with the @entity161 family but it is not clear that @entity65 was directly linked to this noble line			1
the 63 year old professor waited before announcing the denture discovery until the bodies had been reburied in keeping with a request from priest @entity221			0
' this denture was found quite a while ago but the @entity117 priest allowed us to make it public only now , when the process of second burial of the identified bodies was over , ' he said			2
' the local church wanted to do it the proper way - they found @entity161 family descendents in @entity233 , invited them , and held the second funeral in the church			1
' the denture was found in early december 2011			2
we were invited to come for a full working day to work at the scene			0
' it was at the end of this working day that we spotted this amazing denture			0
' let me stress , you must call it a unique discovery			0
in 40 years of my expert experience , i have never come across anything like this - a full size denture			0
' tooth crowns were found before , this is not a surprise , but a full size precious denture is purely a stroke of luck			0
' we are proud to tell about our work now			0
there is no doubt this denture belongs to @entity5 company , we showed it to an elderly expert who studied @entity5 dentures - and a few matching dentures can be found in museums			1
' the dentures from the village church do not carry the @entity269 imprint , possibly because the were chipped			0
but he is entirely confident they are the genuine article			0
' @entity65 is not identified yet but we are still hopeful			2
' she is re-buried now too but in a sort of temporary grave , but her remains may be removed any moment so we can access the body again			0

mystery noble woman 's remains were found in a church near @entity11
her identity remains a puzzle and for now she is known only as @entity65
