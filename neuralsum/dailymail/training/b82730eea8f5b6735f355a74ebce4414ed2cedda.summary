i accept that that 's what it is			2
' when asked if he got pleasure out of killing people , @entity7 told @entity60 : ' no , i thought that people were n't suffering anymore			1
so , in a sense , i thought i was helping			0
' when it was pointed out that many of his patients were n't in pain , he said : ' you know , again , you know , i mean , my goal here is n't to justify			2
' you know what i did there is no justification			0
i just think that the only thing i can say is that i felt overwhelmed at the time			0
' in the interview broadcast last night on @entity26 ' 60 minutes , @entity7 admits that if he had not been stopped , he probably would have went on to kill more people			1
at the time of his arrest in december 2003 , @entity7 told authorities he had administered overdoses to patients to spare them from going into cardiac or respiratory arrest			1
even though there were suspicions at several of the hospitals he worked at , these were never reported or marked on his record and @entity7 was able to continue his killing spree at each place he was transferred to			1

asked why he thought he was able to go undetected for so long , he said : ' i think because it 's a matter of worrying about lawsuits			2
' if they pointed out that there was a problem they were going to be found liable for millions of dollars			0
they just saw it as a lot easier to not put themselves in a position of getting sued			0
' he also revealed that when he was at @entity121 , he was allowed to work one more shift even though he was being fired over the suspicious deaths			0
' the weird thing about @entity121 was is that they were planning on firing me the night before			0
so they let me work one more shift knowing that they were going to fire me the next day , ' he told 60 minutes			0
' so they let me work an additional shift with the suspicion that i had harmed patients			2
