@entity1 leader @entity0 has made a dramatic offer to form an election pact with the @entity4 – but only if they dump @entity6 as leader			1
buoyed by big gains in thursday ’s town hall elections , @entity0 last night said he is ready to join forces with the @entity11 to keep @entity12 out of power			2
senior @entity11 sources flatly dismissed @entity0 ’s call for @entity6 to step down , but significantly did not rule out talks with @entity1 on how they might work together			1
in his first major interview since winning 147 council seats , mr @entity0 told @entity19 : @entity0 said that if @entity6 were to quit he would join the @entity4 at the next election @entity1 and @entity11 candidates could run a single candidate in key parliamentary seats , in effect a @entity11 / @entity1 coalition			1
he plans to take @entity25 by storm by standing in a by - election expected in @entity28 soon			2
he had given mr @entity6 a ‘ kick in the balls ’ in the local elections			1
‘ foolish ’ @entity11 cabinet minister @entity33 had driven voters to @entity1 by branding the party ‘ clowns ’			2
mr @entity0 ’s success has shaken all three main party leaders , and education secretary @entity38 has failed to kill off fresh reports of a bid to topple mr @entity6 by dismissing any such plot as ‘ bonkerooney ’			1
the rumours were refuelled by rebel @entity11 mp @entity44 who told the prime minister last night to ‘ stop pussyfooting around ’ and ‘ get a grip on immigration ’			1
@entity6 has been criticised for failing to neutralise the @entity1 threat tremors from the @entity1 earthquake prompted similar jibes against @entity12 from dissident @entity52			1
and @entity53 said it was ‘ by no means impossible ’ that @entity55 would replace struggling @entity56 before the next election			2
mr @entity0 ’s offer to discuss a general election deal with the @entity4 is another sign of the rapidly changing political landscape in @entity64			0
he says it could win the @entity4 an extra 50 seats – enough for them to stay in power			0
crucially , it would give @entity1 a say in running the country for the first time			0
but mr @entity0 says the @entity11 would have to agree to two demands : @entity73 , with a clear pledge by his successor to hold a prompt in / out referendum on @entity64 ’s membership of the @entity78			1
@entity44 told the prime minister to stop pussyfooting around the issue of immigration he has seized on quirks in election law which would allow @entity1 and @entity11 candidates to wear the rosettes of both parties			1
at a stroke , @entity1 votes in key areas would help the @entity4 keep @entity90 out of power – and bring @entity0 ’s dream of leading @entity64 out of the @entity78 closer			1
until now , the @entity1 leader has ruled out any deals with the @entity11 , partly because mr @entity6 called @entity1 ‘ fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ’			1
but mr @entity0 ’s surge in popularity , together with a slump in mr @entity6 ’s , has prompted a rethink			1
he is now ready to do business with the @entity4 if mr @entity6 is replaced with a more eurosceptic @entity11 leader , such as @entity104 or mr @entity38			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ there are lots of intelligent ways of doing deals in the future , all sorts of things a sensible , patriotic @entity11 leader , could pursue			0
‘ i have been approached by @entity113 who say “ look @entity0 , not only have you taken a lump of our vote but you ’ve also picked up the council estate vote round the corner which is never going to come to us			0
if we ran a candidate on a joint ticket we would walk it			0
” ’ alternatively , the two parties could have a more straightforward non-aggression pact and agree not to run against each other in certain seats , says @entity0			2
he denies claims it is fantasy politics			0
i have sat round the table on sunday evenings with @entity11 officials who have suggested this kind of thing to me			0
’ @entity0 has everything to gain from any such deal			0
@entity1 ’s success on thursday may not translate into a single commons seat in the 2105 general election			0
‘ i ’d rather have half an mp than not one at all , ’ he says bluntly			2
@entity33 branded the party ' clowns ' potentially driving voters to @entity1 he says the @entity4 could win ‘ up to 50 extra seats ’ by teaming up with @entity1 , but it would carry huge risks			0
it could split the party , with eurosceptic mps grabbing the offer , while others may quit the party rather than be associated with the reactionary views of @entity1			0
they would oppose giving mr @entity0 the whip hand and relying on him for a parliamentary majority			0
mr @entity0 maintains the likelihood of the @entity4 dumping @entity6 before the election is not far - fetched			1
‘ i would n’t be so sure			0
’ a senior conservative with close links to mr @entity6 said he would not resign , but did not close the door to talks			2
‘ if @entity1 wants to put proposals to us , let them go ahead , ’ he said .			0

@entity167 should stand for both parties , but only if @entity169 quits
he *savages* ' socialist ' @entity6 and promises immediate @entity78 poll
mp @entity44 told the *pm* to stop ' pussyfooting around ' over immigration
