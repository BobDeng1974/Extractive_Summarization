by @entity0 if you 'd just fallen through a ceiling at work , you might expect a little help			2
but none was forthcoming for hapless shop worker @entity6 , whose colleague appeared completely unconcerned at his plight			1
despite coming crashing down surrounded by debris , the assistant at @entity10 in @entity11 was met with indifference from his co-worker and a customer browsing the store			0
at first , all seems quiet in the golfing supplies retailer , its surveillance camera looking out on a peaceful and apparently average day			0
then , about 20 seconds into the clip , a crunching , cracking sound is heard and , just a second later , mr @entity6 drops onto the shop floor , surrounded by debris			1
he lands apparently quite heavily on his upper back , and just lies there			0
at this point , his colleague saunters over and says : ' @entity40			0
' ' @entity41 , ' mr @entity6 replies			1
' ' alright , do n't move a muscle , ' his colleague tells him			0
another man , apparently a customer , then walks over and asks , incredibly : ' why is there a hole in the ceiling ? ' ' @entity40 ' : mr @entity6 's colleague does n't seem overly concerned at the catastrophic mishap ' why is there a hole in the ceiling ? ' a customer shows off a complete lack of any kind of powers of deduction despite claiming to be okay and trying to get up , mr @entity6 eventually thinks better of it and chooses to just stay lying where he has fallen			2
@entity61 of warrior @entity62 , the company which manages the shop , told @entity65 that mr @entity6 had been in the attic , ironically searching for the wires that eventually captured his fall			1
thankfully , according to mr @entity61 , mr @entity6 was ' completely unharmed ' in the accident and , after a few days , they were ' able to see the comedy of it all ' and made the video public .			2

@entity75 captured the moment @entity6 came plummeting into the shop
ironically , he was in the attic searching for the cables controlling the cctv
