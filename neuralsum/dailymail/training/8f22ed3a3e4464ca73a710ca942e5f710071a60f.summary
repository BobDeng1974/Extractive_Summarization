the revelations are acutely embarrassing for lord @entity1 , who was governor throughout the crisis before stepping down in 2013 the extraordinary complacency of the @entity4 in the run - up to the financial crisis has been laid bare in records of secret meetings held between officials			1
they reveal how blundering officials in the @entity12 ’ – its inner circle of regulators , executives and independent directors including former governor @entity1 – grossly underestimated the scale of the impending meltdown			2
damning revelations include how sir @entity20 , the former chairman of the @entity21 and a member of the @entity12 , described the @entity24 banking system as ‘ sound ’ just two days before the run on @entity27 in september 2007			1
sir @entity20 also played down the financial problems at the stricken @entity31 lender , praising its ‘ good quality loan book ’ on the day before the run on the bank			1
two months later , officials on the @entity12 dismissed the prospect of a full - blown banking crisis , with minutes of a meeting recording that ‘ they do not perceive this as a likely scenario ’			1
the minutes of crisis talks held behind closed doors in @entity44 , in the heart of the @entity46 , have been published today for the first time , after the @entity4 agreed to publish them as part of reforms designed to make it more transparent under new governor @entity52			1
the revelations are acutely embarrassing for @entity54 , who was governor throughout the crisis before stepping down in 2013			1
the records , dated between june 2007 and may 2009 , also reveal how the @entity4 chose to award its staff 5.5 per cent pay rises and bonuses just weeks after the near collapse of @entity27			0
@entity62 mp @entity61 , chairman of the @entity63 , accused directors in the @entity65 of being ‘ cheerleaders ’ who failed to the ‘ provide an effective challenge ’ to the executive headed by @entity54			1
he said : ‘ the executive rarely acknowledged possible weaknesses in its views or , other than grudgingly , admitted that it might have been unprepared for the crisis			2
’ mr @entity61 also accused the @entity12 of ‘ back - covering ’ in the heat of the meltdown , after failing to pay enough attention to the warning signs			2
sir @entity20 , the former chairman of the @entity21 and a member of the @entity12 , described the @entity24 banking system as ‘ sound ’ just two days before the run on @entity27 in 2007 mr @entity52 described the financial crisis as a ‘ turning point in the @entity4 ’s history ’ , adding the minutes provide ‘ further insight into the @entity4 ’s actions during this exceptional period ’			1
but the papers show officials were slow to recognise the scale of the problem , even as @entity27 teetered on the brink of collapse			0
in a meeting convened on september 12 , 2007 , the day before @entity27 submitted a formal request for an emergency loan , sir @entity20 emphasised that the ‘ @entity24 banking system was sound ’			1
the following evening , an emergency meeting was called as the @entity100 ’s then - business editor @entity99 broke the news that the bank had applied for the loan			2
again sir @entity20 appeared to underestimate the scale of the problems pointing out that @entity27 only had a small exposure to risky ‘ sub-prime ’ loans , was well capitalised and ‘ had a good quality loan book ’			1
the records , dated between june 2007 and may 2009 , also reveal how the @entity4 chose to award its staff 5.5 per cent pay rises and bonuses just weeks after the near collapse of @entity27 the full scale of the crisis and the potential threat to other @entity24 banks appeared to dawn on bank officials only following the collapse of @entity122 bank @entity121 in september 2008			1
‘ the crisis had become much more serious , ’ the records of an october 2008 meeting state			2
‘ some of the @entity24 ’s largest banks were facing failure without intervention and the complete seizure of the banking system threatened			1
’ but records also showed officials were pleased with how they had responded to the problems in the financial system			2
‘ there was now a real sense that a corner had been turned and the @entity4 could be proud of its work and contribution … the disease was no longer life threatening but recovery would take time			0
’ @entity145 's analysis : this utterly breath - taking complacency there has always been an air of mystery surrounding the secrets buried inside the temple of the @entity4			0
so today ’s release of extensive minutes from the @entity12 , the @entity4 ’s governing body , covering the period of the 2007 - 09 banking crisis , is an event in itself			1
it effectively marks the end of 320 years of confidentiality			0
running to more than 500 pages , the papers show that far from being an effective watchdog for the bank during the most gripping crisis for a century , the @entity12 was largely a resting place for the great and good of the establishment who were rarely prepared to tackle all - powerful governor @entity1 and his colleagues on issues of national importance			1
in fact the @entity12 was not formally told about several billion pounds of emergency loans made to @entity27 ( under what is known as the ‘ lender of the last resort ’ facility ) until the rescue had been leaked to the @entity100 , prompting a public run on deposits that proved an enormous embarrassment to @entity181 ’s government			0
rash lending : @entity27 was bailed by the taxpayer in 2008 and was the first bank in 150 years to suffer a bank run the overwhelming message from the @entity12 ’s minutes , which detail the view of @entity1 and his colleagues , is one of enormous complacency			0
the initial problems of @entity27 had been caused not just by the bank ’s rash lending practices , such as the notorious 120 per cent mortgage , but by the freeze in the credit markets where banks lend to each other			0
yet there appears to have been little awareness of this among the @entity12 members or for that matter from the governor and his top deputies			0
the credit crunch was an arrow aimed not just at a few smaller banks but at the whole financial system			0
@entity1 dispatched a paper to @entity213 in march 2008 arguing that piecemeal rescues of @entity24 banks would not be enough the @entity4 remained more concerned about its work in controlling inflation than an earthquake in the money markets , where banks lend to each other , that would eventually bring the whole financial system tumbling down and unleash the deepest recession in modern @entity24 history			1
the smugness of the @entity4 and the key regulator , the since abolished @entity21 , was at times breathtaking			0
at a time when @entity27 was dominating the national agenda , the chairman of the @entity21 sir @entity20 gently informed his colleagues on the @entity12 that ‘ the @entity24 banking system was sound ’			1
he could not have been more wrong			0
within months the @entity4 was secretly keeping @entity233 and @entity234 afloat with £ 61.6billion of covert loans designed to stop cash machines from seizing up			0
reality was that @entity1 and his colleagues may not have been sharing their concerns with the @entity12 because of paranoia about leaks			0
but behind the scenes the @entity4 was preparing for the worst			0
on march 17 , 2008 , @entity1 dispatched a paper to @entity213 arguing that piecemeal rescues of @entity24 banks would not be enough and what was needed was wholesale recapitalisation with the @entity248 taking share stakes in all the major banks			2
the governor , however , did not share this view with the @entity12 until october 15 , after the collapse of the @entity122 investment bank @entity121 brought the global capitalist system to the brink			2
it was only then that @entity4 officials explained to the @entity12 the ‘ traumatic events ’ for financial markets in the wake of the @entity121 collapse			0
@entity1 ’s memo to @entity213 is of enormous significance because it takes some of the shine off then - prime minister @entity181 ’s later claim to have ‘ saved the world ’			0
in his memoir beyond the crash , @entity181 claims to have invented the idea of a recapitalisation , as a means of saving the @entity24 banks , on a returning flight from @entity273 in september 2008			1
it now seems it was @entity1 who came up with the concept six months earlier .			0

sir @entity20 said @entity24 banking system was ' sound ' before crash
two months later prospect of full - blown banking crisis was dismissed
@entity283 published for first time under reforms to make it more transparent
