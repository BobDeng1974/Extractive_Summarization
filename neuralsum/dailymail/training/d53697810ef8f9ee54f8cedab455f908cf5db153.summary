by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 13:10 est , 21 december 2012 @entity1 has abandoned wording in its new terms - of - service agreement that sparked outcry from users who feared it meant their photos could appear in advertisements			1
in a blog post published late last night , the popular mobile photo - sharing service says it has changed back the advertising section of its terms of service to the original wording			1
there was outrage this week after the app published new terms on monday which appeared to give it rights over all its users ' photos and data to promote ' sponsored content '			2
anyone who did not agree with the new terms were invited to delete their accounts			0
u-turn : @entity1 has announced it will abandon controversial sections of its new terms of service after a celebrity - led user backlash against wording that appeared to give it rights over uploaded photos but the aggressive strategy failed when a string of high - profile celebrities users , including reality tv star @entity42 and actor @entity43 , took to @entity44 to say they would delete their @entity1 accounts			1
the service 's celebrity users were among the many to join a chorus of criticism as a widespread media and public backlash gathered pace			0
@entity1 , which allows people to add filters and effects to photos and share them easily on the @entity58 , was acquired by @entity59 earlier this year for $ 715million ( £ 440million )			0
in a blog post last night , @entity1 co-founder and ceo @entity60 apologised for a failure to ' communicate our intentions clearly			1
' the terms of service changes pertaining to advertising have been reversed , he said , and restored to what they had been before the changes announced on monday			0
the updated terms also appear to omit a controversial provision which had stated that if a child under the age of 18 used the service , it implied his or her parent had tacitly agreed to @entity1 's terms			1
apology : @entity1 co-founder and ceo @entity60 published a blog late last night where he announced the policy reversal however , the new terms still contain a mandatory arbitration clause , which is not included in terms of service for other leading social media companies like @entity44 , @entity89 , @entity90 or even @entity59 itself			1
that immunises @entity1 from many forms of liability , according to legal experts			0
internet experts said @entity1 had been very aggressive in asserting its rights to user information and inviting anyone who did not agree to delete their accounts within a few weeks			0
the updated terms still say that anyone who accesses @entity1 agrees to be bound by the new terms which are slated to go into effect on january 19			1
also , @entity1 kept language which gave it the ability to place ads in conjunction with user content , and ' that we may not always identify paid services , sponsored content , or commercial communications as such			0
' outrage boiled over after @entity1 adopted several sections from @entity59 's terms of service which seemed to reveal how it hoped to operate as a profitable business in the future			1
foremost among them was the company allowing itself to put users ' names , likenesses , photos and actions online next to any product it is paid to promote			0
@entity1 's home page describes the service as ' free ' , however the new terms made clear that users effectively hand over the rights to their pictures and personal information as a quid pro quo in exchange for access			1
clause two of updated the @entity138 section of @entity1 's new terms of service said : ' you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username , likeness , photos ( along with any associated metadata ) , and / or actions you take , in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions , without any compensation to you			2
' what this seemed to mean was that @entity1 can now takes its users ' identities and data and put them next to any business partner who pays for the privilege of advertising on the site			2
angry : amongst those threatening to leave @entity1 are @entity42 , @entity164 and @entity165 @entity42 and @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 were among the string of celebrities who lined up to criticise the move on @entity44			1
' yikes ! bye instagram , ' @entity167 tweeted , while @entity166 added : ' bummer			0
' reality superstar @entity42 tweeted : ' i really loved @entity1 :-( i need to review this new policy			1
i do n't think its fair			0
' her sister wrote : ' wow … i just read over @entity1 ’s new policy … so sad , looks like i might be deleting my @entity1 after jan 16			2
' ' i really loved @entity1 ' : @entity42 uses the photo ap to take and share countless photos from her life following the outcry at the new terms , the photo - sharing app immediately moved to water down the new terms , with mr @entity60 writing a blog post addressing the issue entitled ' thank you , and we 're listening ' , where he said the company had heard ' loud and clear ' from ' confused and upset ' users			1
yesterday the language that had appeared to allow @entity1 advertisers to display user photos without compensation have been removed from updated terms of service			2
@entity1 representatives could not immediately be reached for comment			0
mr @entity60 stressed in his latest blog post that the company had no intention of selling the photos that users post on the service			2
' going forward , rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed , we are going to take the time to complete our plans , and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work , ' he said .			0

controversial sections of new policy reverted to their original form after *massive* backlash among users
