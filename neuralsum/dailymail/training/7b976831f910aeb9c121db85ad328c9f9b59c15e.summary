one in ten households in the @entity2 now have assets worth more than £ 1million , experts have found			1
soaring house prices in @entity5 , rising share prices and brimming pension pots mean that more people than ever are sitting on huge virtual nest eggs totalling £ 5.5trillion in @entity2			1
but the figures analysed by the @entity11 also show a growing wealth gap , with the richest one per cent now having 850 times more in assets than the poorest in society			1
a picture of @entity2 's wealth : one in ten households had assets worth £ 967,200 in 2010 , but experts say this is now worth at least £ 1million figures show the very wealthiest own an average of £ 2.8million of assets compared to the average £ 3,600 of debt by those most struggling to get by			1
professor @entity26 , who lead the study , found that 10 per cent of @entity2 homes had total assets of £ 967,200 in 2010 , but an upturn in the @entity2 economy since then means this ' has pushed the entry point into that wealthiest tenth over the million - pound mark today ' , he said			1
around 2.5million of households are in this enviable position			2
and the majority are those most well - off are middle aged , having benefited from decades of rising house prices and also various inheritances			1

while they have significant assets , much of it is tied up in something which they can not actually use to pay for the weekly food shop or their rising energy bill , such as their pension pot or their home			0
the @entity93 has also looked at the same figures and found there are huge regional variations in the number of millionaire households			0
regional breakdown : according to the @entity93 , this graphic shows how wealth is distributed in @entity2 , with highest concentration of millionaire households is in @entity5 and the @entity104 the @entity104 is the biggest winner , with 15.5 per cent – or more than one in six – of households in the richest 10 per cent , compared to only 6.9 per cent in @entity108 and 7.6 per cent in the @entity109 and @entity110			1
their research shows the effect of the house price boom			0
many of the millionaire households bought their properties decades ago and have seen their value soar			0
