@entity22 with parents @entity23 and @entity9			1
@entity9 faced losing both when @entity13 went into labour terrified @entity9 was forced to give the go - ahead for emergency surgery aware that both his wife and daughter may not survive			1
although surgeons managed to stabilise @entity13 , tiny baby @entity22 was kept in intensive care for months while doctors tried to help her grow strong enough to survive			1
but now , they are celebrating after @entity34 , now seven months , has been allowed to come home for the first time - a day @entity9 feared he 'd never see			2

i knew it had to be serious because of the way they were rushing around but i did n't have a clue what was happening			0
' after what felt like forever a nurse pulled me to one side and told me that @entity13 's life was in danger and in order to save her life they would have to deliver @entity34			1

i had cannulas in both arms and doctors all around me			0
i was just terrified that i would lose my baby			0

@entity13 said : ' we did n't know if baby @entity22 would survive but because i was so poorly myself i did n't really know that much about it			1
' @entity13 stayed in hospital for a further two weeks and @entity22 was kept in an incubator in intensive care , where her life hung in the balance for two months later as a result of her being delivered so @entity126 parents @entity13 and @entity9 travelled to the hospital every day to visit baby @entity22 , who spent two months in intensive care and one in high dependency before being transferred to the @entity130 at the @entity59 , from where she has just been released			1
