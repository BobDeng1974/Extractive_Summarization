by @entity0 @entity1 , @entity2 - and lemurs ? they are not known for their photography skills			0
but this cheeky group of primates at @entity9 in @entity10 displayed a surprising enthusiasm when a photographer left her camera in their paddock			1
and one of them seemed intense and serious as he directed the camera at his chosen subject			1
however , their approach quickly descended into something more ... unusual			0
one climbed on top of the camera , before jumping down in a bid to pull off the lens cap			1
eventually one looked like he was going to take a snap - but thought better of it and started swinging around the tripod			1
fascinated : the group seemed perfectly content twisting the lens of this state - of - the - art @entity28 camera should you be doing that ? this one was perhaps too comfortable clawing at the expensive equipment lemurs are an old group of primates which evolved in near isolation after @entity59 split away from the @entity61 mainland			1
they filled the ecological niches occupied by monkeys , the dominant primates , on mainland @entity61			2
as there was no competition from monkeys on @entity59 , lemurs soon came to dominate its rainforests , until boats started to arrive around 2,000 years ago and human hunters arrived			2
lemur size ranges from the world 's smallest primate to - until fairly recently - some of its largest , the sloth lemurs , which rivalled gorillas in size			0
budding snappers : the animals surveyed the camera ahead of the zoo 's annual photography competition yesterday 's display of photography from this collection of lemurs comes as the zoo prepares for its annual photography competition , which closes at the end of august			0
judges include @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			0

group of lemur monkeys at @entity9 left intrigued by camera
leaped off their branch to investigate the *bizarre* *apparatus*
one looked serious and intense directing the camera at its chosen subject
but *decided* to climb it and play with the lens instead of taking photos
