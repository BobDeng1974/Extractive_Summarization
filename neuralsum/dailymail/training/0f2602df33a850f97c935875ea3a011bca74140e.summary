the @entity1 ’s t - shirt investigation took a sinister twist last week as our journalists were spied on and followed by security guards from the @entity7 factory			1
the men , among them drivers for factory boss @entity10 , tailed @entity12 reporter @entity11 and photographer @entity13 for hours along the island ’s palm - fringed roads			1
at one point they were even lying in wait when the journalists arrived at a secluded riverside hotel they had checked in to only hours before			2
camera shy : @entity12 photographer @entity22 ’s shot of the henchmen following him and reporter @entity11 though the burly guards made no approach to the @entity12 journalists , it was clear their aim was to monitor their movements and to intimidate any factory workers who may have wanted to speak out			1
@entity11 and @entity13 first became aware they were the subject of unwelcome attention on thursday when they visited a @entity7 factory in a sprawling industrial estate in @entity38 , just outside the island ’s capital @entity41 , at noon			1
they had planned to speak to more of the migrant workers about their working conditions at the plant			1
seeing four guards on the razor wire - topped gate , the pair waited at nearby food stalls , hoping the workers would go there for lunch			1
however , they were told by a local shopkeeper that the only workers who leave the complex at lunchtime were @entity57 , rather than their colleagues from @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			1
one of the @entity7 factory guards is pictured lurking in the shadows the journalists began talking to the @entity57 factory workers and within minutes a team of security officers began to station themselves around the stalls , setting an intimidating atmosphere sure to keep workers from talking to our journalists			1
@entity11 and @entity13 got back in their car and drove away while the guards looked on			1
the @entity12 team visited a union office in @entity41			0
afterwards , when they got back in their car , they spotted a grey @entity80 parked further up the street with two of the guards sitting in it			0
the car started following the journalists , sticking close though several turns in busy traffic			0
at one point the @entity12 car made a quick turn , shaking off the watchers , then went back around the block to find the confused guards parked at the side of the road , looking in all directions as the traffic sped by			2
@entity13 quickly pulled in front of them blocking them in , and got out of the car to photograph the men			1
suddenly the security team became shy and pulled down the car ’s sun visors to obscure their faces , then unhooked the visors to shield themselves			0
one of them attempted to take a photograph of the journalists using his mobile phone before reversing the car out of the tight spot and driving off			0
five minutes later , the journalists realised the same car was behind them again			0
once again , they made a few quick turns , confirming they were being tailed , before losing them down an alleyway			2
that evening the journalists returned to @entity41 only to find one of the men who had been following them earlier standing in the shadows outside the hotel with another man			2
@entity11 said : ‘ we were particularly shocked as we had only changed hotels hours before and made sure we had n’t been followed			1
' by this time we started to feel uneasy and asked the parking attendant about the men			0
he told us that they were drivers for @entity10			0
’ the boss : the men included drivers for the boss of the @entity7 factory , @entity10 ( pictured ) the journalists had planned to speak to more of the migrant workers about their working conditions at the @entity7 plant ( pictured ) pictured are some of the many @entity59 workers in the @entity7 factory in @entity57 where the t - shirts are made however there was no sign of mr @entity10 in the hotel , and reception staff confirmed he was not a guest nor having a meeting there			1
the men lurked outside the hotel until 11pm			0
the following day when the @entity12 team returned to the factory in @entity38 , one of the men was waiting inside the compound			2
when asked , he denied following them the previous day			0
according to global union @entity158 , such sinister activity is not uncommon in @entity57			2
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity161 leaders have their phones tapped and are followed by the secret police			0
‘ it is not uncommon for factory managements to establish unions that they control in order to mask their poor labour practices			0
