creating structures in space that astronauts can live in has become a priority for @entity4			2
with a manned mission to @entity7 on the agenda , and plans for lunar exploration underway , scientists are increasingly looking towards unconventional construction methods			2
the most promising of these is @entity13 , which could make building a lunar home in space a matter of pressing a button and letting a robot do the work			2
according to researchers , @entity32 could allow computer - controlled machines to build houses within 24 hours			0
the layered fabrication technology sees concrete , or other material such as lunar soil , applied in a pre-determined design by a nozzle on a moveable gantry			1
a process called @entity32 allows computer - controlled machines to build houses within 24 hours			0
the layered fabrication technology sees concrete , or other material such as lunar soil , applied in a pre-determined design by a nozzle on a moveable gantry , as shown in this image @entity4 has provided funding to the @entity30 to develop the 3d printing technique known as @entity32			1
it hopes this will allow astronauts to have a base on the moon in the near future the technology means it will also be possible to create curved concrete walls , such as the ones pictured @entity32 could allow computer - controlled machines to build houses within 24 hours			2
the layered fabrication technology sees concrete , or other material such as lunar soil , applied in a pre-determined design by a nozzle on a moveable gantry			1
the nature of the technology means it will also be possible to create curved walls and architecture that is both ' exotic ' and ' beautiful '			1
aside from creating buildings in space , the innovation could have applications in building simple homes in disaster zones or slum areas			1
the theory is that 90 per cent of the materials needed to build the structure already exists on the @entity23			0
the few parts that would need to be made on @entity22 would be folded from a tubular module that can be transported by space rocket			0
professor @entity85 from the @entity30 claims that @entity32 construction methods can build entire lunar houses with all the fixtures and fittings			0
the nature of the technology means it will also be possible to create curved walls and architecture that is both ' exotic ' and ' beautiful ' , according to professor @entity85			1
aside from creating buildings in space , the innovation could have applications in building simple homes in disaster zones or slum areas			1
it could also be used to print out customised luxury homes , professor @entity85 said			0
scientists believe that 90 per cent of the materials needed to build structures on the @entity23 already exist on its surface			0
this means the cost of creating lunar buildings would be much cheaper than sending materials from @entity22 to the lunar service aside from creating buildings in space , the innovation could have applications in building simple homes in disaster zones or slum areas some fixtures created using @entity32			1
professor @entity85 from the @entity30 claims that the process can build entire lunar houses with all the fixtures and fittings			0

technology will see lunar soil layers built up in a pre-determined design
*system* will work like a *giant* @entity13 using a nozzle and moveable gantry
could create curved walls and architecture that is ' exotic ' and ' beautiful '
aside from buildings in space , the innovation could have applications in creating simple homes in disaster zones or slum areas
