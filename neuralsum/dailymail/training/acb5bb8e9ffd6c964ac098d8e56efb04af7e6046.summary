a secret cache of @entity4 ’s chemical weapons has been found in @entity5 , the country ’s new rulers announced yesterday			1
the deadly arsenal proves the tyrant had refused to give up his weapons of mass destruction – despite promising @entity10 he would relinquish them in the infamous ‘ @entity12 ’			1
the @entity13 said the chemical warheads had been secured and would be made safe by experts			2
under examination : one of @entity4 's deadly missiles that was hidden in one of 80 ammunition bunkers just south of @entity20 a spokesman said : ‘ they are from the @entity4 era and are under guard until they can be handed over			1
’ to this day , mr @entity10 defends his decision to embrace @entity4 by trumpeting the idea that he forced the dictator to give up his @entity30 programme			1
his spokesman said earlier this week : ‘ mr @entity10 , in office , had been responsible for getting @entity4 to give up his chemical and nuclear weapons programme and renounce terrorism			1
’ @entity4 agreed to destroy most of his weapons of mass destruction in 2003 as part of moves to bring @entity5 , then a pariah state , in from the cold			1
the agreement was sealed in 2004 when mr @entity10 shook hands with @entity4 in a tent outside @entity45			1
the disarming process was being overseen by the @entity47 , but was never finished because of the outbreak of war			0
warheads : @entity4 had stored piles of ammunition and stored them wherever he could it meant the dictator retained around ten tons of deadly mustard gas and other chemicals			1
throughout the uprising , rebels feared vengeful @entity4 – who warned they faced the ‘ fires from @entity61 ’ – would unleash @entity30 on his own people			2
in @entity64 , panic gripped the population when forces loyal to @entity4 were seen wearing gas @entity68 spy planes and satellites monitored suspected chemical weapons dumps at three separate locations , including the @entity74 site some 130 miles south of the tyrant ’s birthplace @entity20			1
@entity77 is still flying sorties over @entity5 , mainly in an effort to hunt down @entity4 ’s @entity81 - educated playboy son @entity80 , last seen making a dash for the desert border with @entity84			2
@entity5 ’s new leaders yesterday begged @entity77 to continue with the mission			0
frightening : @entity87 are ready to be used to kill and maim , but they will now be destroyed @entity89 , chairman of the @entity13 , said he wanted @entity77 help until ‘ the end of the year ’ in stopping @entity4 loyalists fleeing justice			2
but at the @entity96 headquarters of the alliance , @entity77 officials recalled their @entity99 mandate was to protect civilians , not target individuals			0
a meeting of @entity77 ambassadors was postponed from yesterday until tomorrow to allow for further discussion , but is still expected to endorse a decision to halt the @entity5 mission on october 31			0

the programme , broadcast on monday , claimed he personally tortured prisoners and was involved in the 1996 massacre of more than 1,200 inmates at the country ’s notorious @entity131			0
broken : colonel @entity4 had promised @entity10 that he had got rid of his weapons of mass destruction , but this has proved he did not @entity107 , who made a high - profile defection to @entity108 in march as @entity4 ’s regime crumbled , accused programme - makers of making ‘ false allegations ’ , claiming : ‘ i have never tortured anyone nor been involved in torture			1
neither was i present at the massacre at @entity131			0
’ he added : ‘ i also had no involvement of any kind or knowledge of the bombing of @entity114 over @entity114 in 1988 or the murder of @entity151 in 1984			0
‘ i have voluntarily assisted the relevant investigatory authorities with their inquiries in relation to these matters			0
’ @entity107 is now in @entity156 , having been permitted to leave @entity108 , following an @entity158 decision to lift sanctions against him			0
