plans for a seven - day @entity2 are ' not realistic ' and would require more funding , a leading doctors have warned			1
the proposal to make @entity2 hospitals offer a full range of healthcare services , including elective operations and diagnostic tests , seven days a week was first announced in 2013 by @entity11 medical director sir @entity10			1
he suggested hospital trusts could be contractually obliged to do so and face fines for breaches			0
but dr @entity15 , chairman of the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) council , said offering services on saturdays and sundays would lead to them being cancelled during the week			2
plans to make hospitals offer a full range of healthcare services seven days a week are ' not realistic ' and would require more funding , the @entity20 ( @entity16 ) has warned this would amount to a ' diversion of services ' rather than an expansion , he said			1
dr @entity15 , speaking to the @entity29 , said : ' it 's not realistic to carry on doing what we are doing at the moment and then add a new service on top of it within existing resources			0
' if the decision ( by a hospital ) is taken to put half a dozen outpatient clinics on a sunday afternoon then they have to be taken from somewhere else - that is , they wo n't be on on a particular day during the week			2
' that 's the inescapable reality of doing this within existing resources , but politicians ' vision does n't go into that sort of detail			0
' the criticism was made following the @entity16 's submission to the @entity54 , which advises the government on doctors ' pay			1
writing in its submission , the @entity16 warned : ' ill - thought - through implementation could threaten both the standard of service patients receive and the viability of the service			1
' we believe that pursuing an ill - informed seven - day service model would be at best wasteful for the @entity2 – and at worst threaten patient safety			1
' in july last year , sir @entity10 said making the @entity2 provide seven - day services was his ' number one priority '			1
his review came after statistics showed there was a higher mortality rate at weekends - as high as 11 per cent on a saturday and 16 per cent on a sunday , according to an analysis of more than 14 million hospital admissions in 2009/10			0
@entity16 chairman dr @entity15 ( pictured ) said putting on services on saturdays and sundays would lead to them being cancelled during the week , leading to a ' diversion ' rather than an expansion of services the changes could cost around £ 1 billion to implement with routine surgery for minor conditions , such as hernias , as well as blood tests , x-rays , ultrasounds and mri scans to be carried out at weekends			0
speaking in december 2013 , sir @entity10 , said : ' it seems strange in many ways that we should start to wind down on a friday afternoon and warm up on a sunday while operating theatres are empty , outpatient clinics echo , expensive diagnostic kit is n't being used and in the meantime people are waiting for diagnosis and treatment			0
' last year @entity98 also promised that everyone would have access to a family doctor seven days a week by the end of the decade			0
he wants @entity104 to open for up to 12 hours every day by 2020 to relieve pressure on accident and emergency units , which are becoming overwhelmed due to dissatisfaction with out - of - hours gp services			0
but the @entity16 have warned the plans will waste resources and threaten the quality of care during the week .			2
