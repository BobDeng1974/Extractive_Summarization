retired high court judge sir @entity0 said cohabiting couples should never be allowed legal rights over each other ’s money and property cohabiting couples should never be allowed legal rights over each other ’s money and property , one of @entity11 ’s most senior family law experts said yesterday			1
giving them the same rights as married couples would be naive and send out the wrong message , said retired high court judge sir @entity0			1
his intervention comes amid fresh attempts – backed by many judges and lawyers – to push a law through @entity22 setting out legal entitlements for those in live - in relationships			1
he said any law designed to give special rights to just one section of the population would be a mistake			1
and he criticised politicians – including @entity32 leader @entity32 – who support a new law for ‘ giving the impression that marriage does n’t matter ’			2
sir @entity0 , who heads the @entity38 think - tank , is the first senior judge to come out strongly against any cohabitation law			1
he had once supported such a move , he said , as it would protect women left penniless after the breakdown of a long live - in relationship			0
but yesterday he told the @entity45 : ‘ i have had a damascene conversion			0
i used to be quite in favour of some form of legal protection			0
‘ but i have drawn away from a cohabitation law			1
it is a naive , lawyer - driven idea , and some leadership is needed			1
’ sir @entity0 , who retired in april but still presides in the occasional family case , said that giving legal rights to cohabitees would be a signal of official approval of such relationships			1
‘ you have to look at the bigger picture , ’ he said			0
‘ there are nearly two million children of these relationships and they are at a disadvantage because of that			2
i think that is fully established now			0
the government should be unequivocal in its support for marriage			0
half of all family litigation is a matter of family breakdown among the unmarried			0
‘ that means 20 per cent of the population but 50 per cent of family court workload			0
can you imagine the effect on the courts if there is legislation to give rights to cohabitees ? ’ sir @entity0 said the debate on changing the law had overshadowed arguments about the need to strengthen marriage and called for more attention to be paid to ‘ the terrible problem of family breakdown and the divisions it is creating in society ’			1
sir @entity0 ’s intervention comes as much of the legal profession and many politicians have been trying to build support for a cohabitation law.the most senior family law judge , @entity96 sir @entity95 , said in october that the lack of legal protection for cohabitees ‘ is an injustice which has been recognised as long as i have been in the law ’ ‘ people think marriage is for the likes of them , it ’s not for us			1
this is not helped by people like @entity32 and others who give the impression that marriage does n’t matter and all relationships are the same			2

the most senior family law judge , @entity96 sir @entity95 , said in october that the lack of legal protection for cohabitees ‘ is an injustice which has been recognised as long as i have been in the law ’			1
he said : ‘ reform is desperately needed			0
how many more women are to be condemned to injustice in the meantime ? ’ @entity32 peer @entity129 has tabled a @entity131 in the @entity132 that would give cohabiting partners rights after they had lived together for two years or after they have had children			0
that would see a cohabitee entitled to a share of the money , property and pension of their former partner in the event of a break - up			0
lawyers have been calling for such a law for of years			2
however , critics point out that it would provide a new source of lucrative earnings for the legal profession			0
@entity154 rejected the idea of a cohabitation law shortly after the @entity157 took power in 2010			1
there are nearly three million cohabiting couples in the country , with numbers rising			0
however , such relationships typically last only a third as long as the average marriage			2
and evidence also shows that children of cohabitees are less wealthy , less healthy and less likely to do well at school			0
critics blame the rise of cohabitation for the increasing number of children in one - parent families .			2

retired judge sir @entity0 is against any cohabitation law
while once supporting it , he now thinks it is a ' lawyer driven idea '
putting laws around such relationships gives them ' official approval '
