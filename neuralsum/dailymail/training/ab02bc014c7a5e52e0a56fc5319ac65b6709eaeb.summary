many drone operators already use @entity2 cameras on their flying machines , so it was only a matter of time before the firm launched a range of its own			1
sources ‘ familiar with the plans ’ told the @entity9 that the @entity11 - based firm is looking to release a range of multirotor helicopters ‘ late next year ’			1
the devices would be fitted with @entity2 cameras , controlled remotely and are expected to retail for between $ 500 ( £ 317 ) and $ 1,000 ( £ 634 )			1

they would be fitted with a @entity2 camera and controlled remotely , and would directly rival drones from the likes of @entity21 and @entity22 ( pictured ) at this price range , the drones would be targeted more towards consumers and hobbyists and compete with market leaders @entity21 and @entity22 , rather than rival the likes of professional devices from @entity30			1
@entity2 action cameras start at entry - level devices such as the hero that costs $ 129.99 ( £ 99.99 in the @entity34 ) , up to the top - of - the range @entity36 model , for $ 499 ( £ 369.99 in the @entity34 )			1
it is likely the entry level drones will feature the cheaper versions of its cameras , while the high - end copters will be fitted with the next - generation versions			2

earlier this week drone maker dji launched its $ 2,900 ( £ 1,840 ) @entity52 1 drone			1
it is the world ’s first flying @entity67 camera			2
the @entity72 maintains stability in strong wind conditions , transmits 1080p video wirelessly up to one mile ( 1.7km ) away , and comes with a mobile app to control the gadget			0
it lasts for around 18 minutes in the air before needing to be recharged			0
@entity79 has contacted @entity2 for more information			2

and in september , physicists from @entity89 unveiled a foldable drone , dubbed a cross between a @entity2 and a quadcopter			2

when the wearer wants it to start filming , they press a button and the drone unfolds and flies overhead , tracking their movements using motion sensors			0

and the concept recently won @entity134 ’s annual make it wearable competition .			0

@entity2 drones are expected to retail between $ 500 ( £ 317 ) and $ 1,000 ( £ 634 )
they would be fitted with a @entity2 camera and controlled remotely
*reports* claim the consumer drones could launch ‘ late next year ’
device would rival drones from likes of *parrot* and dji
