it was n't the gung - ho attacking display watching @entity3 fans will have been hoping for , but @entity5 's mature performance for @entity7 's under 21 side on tuesday night showed signs of promise			1
not least because he was able to get another 90 minutes of competitive football under his belt in only his fourth appearance of the season			0
two for @entity3 and two for @entity17 's side			1
@entity5 helped @entity7 's @entity18 emerge victorious against @entity19 on both occasions , with back - to - back 2 - 1 wins earning them a place at next year 's @entity23			1
@entity7 under 21 defender @entity5 ( left ) challenges for the ball with @entity19 's @entity26 ( right ) but for @entity5 it was more important than just securing tournament next summer			1
he needed playing time as he fights for full fitness and a regular place in @entity33 's starting @entity32 he did his chances of nailing down a spot at @entity36 no harm in @entity38 , dealing with his defensive duties with ease while trying to show off the natural attacking side of his game			2
after 15 minutes he used his considerable pace to drive into space down @entity7 's left side when the ball made its way into central midfield			2
he got hold of it inside @entity19 's defensive third moments later and immediately looked up in the hope of delivering a quality cross			2
his execution was poor but his intentions were always positive			0
always in an advanced position when @entity7 were on the ball , @entity5 already looks well - suited to a left wing back role should @entity59 opt to bring back the preferred 3 - 5 - 2 formation he used at the start of the campaign			1
@entity5 puts @entity64 midfielder @entity63 under pressure in @entity66 on tuesday evening surprisingly @entity5 did n't see much of the ball in opening period , with much of @entity7 's attacking play coming down the right and @entity19 choosing to try and open up their opponents through the middle			1
but after 36 minutes he burst into life after @entity75 's headed clearance fell to him on the edge of @entity7 's box			0
first he showed a clever touch to lift the ball over an onrushing @entity82 player 's head , before sprinting into the opposition 's half , cutting back and finding a team - mate			0
the move ended with a @entity88 shot being well saved			0
although he was the victim of a nutmeg early in the second period , @entity5 looked calm when faced with @entity82 attackers wanting to do his side harm			2
he dealt with lively substitute and goalscorer @entity93 shortly after his embarrassing moment , clearing the ball for a throw - in in one of few tests of his defensive qualities			0
he was back at the other end shortly afterwards , cutting inside and finding himself in the middle of @entity19 's penalty area			2
his short pass found @entity105 , whose low shot was easily blocked			0
@entity5 ( back row , second from left ) poses with his @entity7 team - mates before kick - off in @entity19 another show of pace and neat backheel to @entity113 followed , before a clever ball down the side of @entity19 's defence allowed @entity117 to drive into the box and win a late corner			1
whether it was @entity19 looking deflated after @entity113 ' winning goal , or simply a belief in his own ability , @entity5 looked increasingly confident as the game went on , bringing the ball out of defence , stopping to take a look around and laying it off and dropping back into position			1
like most players on the pitch he looked tired towards the end , but that 's to be expected given the injury lay - off which has limited his action so far this season			0
a few more games like this and he 'll be up to speed for both club and country .			0

@entity143 beat @entity19 2 - 1 to reach the @entity23
the result sealed a 4 - 2 aggregate win for @entity17 's side
@entity5 completed both games after dropping out of the senior squad
the @entity3 defender coped well defensively
he tried to get forward but was unable to really trouble @entity19
@entity5 is fighting to be fully fit after missing @entity3 's first five league games
