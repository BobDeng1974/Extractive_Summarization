the manufacturer of the helmet worn by @entity2 say he was not wearing their most up - to - date model after the @entity6 batsman was left fighting for his life having been knocked out by a bouncer			1
@entity2 , 25 , who was pressing for a @entity10 recall , crashed to the ground unconscious after the heavy blow to the lower head and was rushed to hospital from the @entity15 on tuesday			1
television images showed the helmeted @entity2 , who had scored a composed 63 for @entity17 in the @entity19 game , standing dazed before going down face - first following the rising delivery from @entity22 bowler @entity21			1
he is in an induced coma and in a critical condition @entity29 released this graphic to illustrate how their old 2013 helmet may not ' fully protect ' the batsman @entity29 , the @entity35 - based manufacturer of the helmet worn by @entity2 and one of the leading suppliers of protective headgear to the world 's top batsmen , said in a statement they wished him a ' full and speedy recovery '			1
their statement said they were seeking as much footage of the incident as possible to be able to see more conclusively exactly where @entity2 had been hit			2
' from the footage and pictures currently available to @entity29 , it appears that @entity2 was struck by the ball to the rear of the grille and below the back of the shell , missing his @entity10 model helmet , ' the company 's statement said			1
' this is a vulnerable area of the head and neck that helmets can not fully protect , while enabling batsmen to have full and proper movement			0
' however , @entity29 's statement added : ' the newly - developed @entity68 helmet , which supersedes the 2013 helmet worn by @entity2 , does afford batsmen extra protection in this region â€“ - and still allows comfortable movement			1
' the moment @entity2 is struck in the head by a delivery during day one of the @entity19 match between @entity22 and @entity17 at @entity15 the bouncer can be seen ( left ) just before it made contact with @entity2 the moments leading up to @entity2 ' collapse shows the cricketer paused for a couple of moments before he hit the ground nevertheless , it was yet to be determined whether a change of helmet could have prevented @entity2 's accident or indeed if the design of the one he was wearing had played any part at all in his injury			1
@entity29 managing director @entity93 said : ' the thoughts of everyone at @entity96 are with @entity2 and his family			2
' helmet manufacturers are constantly developing their products to make them safer			0
' we work continuously with the governing authorities worldwide to reduce the risk of injury to players			0
' a spokesman for @entity29 told @entity106 the new @entity68 helmet had gone on sale in the @entity35 in august 2014			1
this is the moment batsman @entity109 collapsed and hit the ground face first at the @entity15 on thursday afternoon he was helped by @entity22 players after falling to the ground the @entity22 players yelled out for help after @entity2 was hit former @entity116 fast bowler @entity115 said he had been ' horrified ' by @entity2 's injury , particularly as he was a top - order batsman			1
@entity115 , who in the first test of the 2005 ashes at @entity120 struck @entity121 , one of cricket 's greatest batsmen , with a delivery that hit the then @entity17 captain between the helmet and the grille , drawing blood from the @entity130 's cheek , told @entity131 : ' it 's horrifying seeing something like that happen to a top - order batsman			1
' you sometimes fear for lower - order players , bowlers especially when they 're batting and facing the quick bowlers			0
you do n't fear too much for the top - order batsmen because they 're good players and they 're used to fending off short balls			0
@entity22 players @entity21 ( right ) and @entity143 are pictured at the @entity19 on tuesday , when the tragic event occurred @entity146 team doctor @entity145 briefs the media outside @entity15 's @entity149 's hospital ' it just looked like a freak accident , ' added @entity115 , echoing comments made by other leading cricketers and experienced observers			1
' it 's saddening and sickening to see such a fantastic player in the position he 's in			0
we all hope he pulls through			0
' safety standards for helmets in @entity163 county cricket , where @entity2 has had spells with @entity165 , @entity166 and most recently @entity167 , were already in the process of being improved prior to his accident			2
@entity170 , chief executive of @entity116 's @entity171 , said : ' there is a new @entity35 safety standard which is in the process of being implemented that will hopefully offer a greater measure of protection			2
the critically injured @entity2 was carted by medical transport vehicle to a waiting ambulance as doctors worked to treat the batsman players and ambulance officers raised a white sheet to shield @entity2 as he was loaded into a waiting vehicle ' the standard is now live and the manufacturers are working with testing houses on designs that will pass			2
' the first batch of helmets are coming through now which would pass the test and we 're hopeful we will see them used in professional cricket next season			0
' however , @entity170 said complete protection was impossible			0
' it 's difficult to know exactly what difference the standard might have made in this precise circumstance because there will always be an element of risk in cricket , ' he said			0
' the balls are hard and they travel fast			0
no design will eliminate risk completely			0
