it was a battle of claw versus jaw , but the king of the jungle reigned supreme in his battle against a crocodile			0
the two killing - machines fought over feeding rights at a @entity10 river in @entity11 , @entity12 after the crocodile tried to take the lion 's lunch - a dead elephant			1
the lion was among a pride that was about to eat the elephant when the crocodile crawled up and tried to take a bite			1
the lions then began to drive the beast away by clawing and biting at the armoured reptile 's legs			1
jaws versus claws : the lion and the crocodile square - off at a @entity10 river in @entity11 , @entity12 , after the reptile tries to take the big cat 's lunch paws for thought : the lion lifts one of its paws and prepares to strike the crocodile which lunges forward baring its teeth eventually the crocodile retreated to the safety of the deeper waters			1
photographer @entity43 , 50 , captured the battle unfolding			0
he said : ' for a while there was a @entity47 standoff with neither making the first move but i believe the lion was fearing for the safety of its cubs and made the first move			0
' it was n't long before other lions moved in and began to claw and bite at the legs of the crocodile all the while making sure to stay clear of its huge jaws			2
dine in , but not takeaway : the lions guard the dead elephant and appear to be looking towards the water cautious of the crocodiles intentions lowest of the low : the crocodile slides along on its belly as a young lion hovers on the waters edge , keen to deter it from lunging futher fancy a pedicure ? the lion nips at the reptiles claws as it thrashes about in pain , trying to edge back into the safety of the water two on one : an adult lion and a young cub leap at the crocodile whose open mouth looks big enough to swallow them whole back you go : a lion bites the soft underside of the reptile , left , as another stands on its back and attempts to push it away on your tail : the crocodile seems to acknowledge defeat as three lions straddle its rear quarters and force it back into the water ' the crocodile actually tried to get closer for a second time but was soon overwhelmed so it backed off			2
' mr @entity43 said it was ' amazing ' to watch the fight			0
he said : ' it 's not very often these two predators fight and neither animal underestimated its opponent			0

a pride of lions were trying to eat a dead elephant when they noticed a crocodile had taken an *interest* in their meal
the crocodile then crawled out of the @entity10 river and tried to *challenge* the pride for a *nibble* of their kill
@entity43 who witnessed the fight said the lions clawed and bit at the reptile 's legs while *carefully* *avoiding* its jaws
