challenge : mr @entity1 honed his skills in @entity3 , where he was an adventure activities instructor he was the climber whose love of @entity3 ’s mountains inspired his attempt on the feared @entity10 - an @entity9 adventure that ended in tragedy and left his body locked in a tomb of ice			1
when @entity1 plunged from the 14,690ft peak in 1979 , the odds against finding his body were as high as the vertical challenges he lived for			1
but , 34 years on , melting glacial ice - a result of global warming - has revealed his remains , which have finally been reunited with his family			1
the 27 - year - old ex-paratrooper was an instructor at an outward bound centre at @entity25 , near @entity26 , @entity27 , when he set out to conquer the @entity10 – only to join the 250 mountaineers whose bodies have never been recovered from its perilous north face			1
now his family - who founded a charity in his honour - are preparing to scatter the ashes of the @entity36 former public schoolboy			2
mr @entity1 had overcome troubled times to find peace in the @entity39			1
honing his craft on the demanding peaks , he became a highly respected mountaineer			2
a few days after spending @entity44 with his family , the @entity43 ex-pupil set off for @entity45 with a @entity47 friend			0
the path to his final adventure had been long and often troubled			0
he was not regarded as a model pupil at his school and left under a cloud , developing a drug problem in his teens			0
but after leaving school he travelled to @entity56 , where he turned his life around			0
ambitious : mr @entity1 made his attempt on the @entity10 , alongside a @entity47 friend , in 1979 feared : the ominous @entity10 in the @entity9 , viewed from @entity60 once back in @entity61 , he joined the @entity62 , developing a passion for the outdoors and learning to ski and climb			1
he left the @entity65 in the 1970s and studied to be an outdoor instructor , eventually working for the @entity67 at @entity25			0
@entity3 provided his ‘ role in life ’			0
mr @entity1 ’s sister , @entity70 , recalled yesterday : ‘ he loved the @entity3 mountains and the charity we founded in his honour to help young climbers continues to have very strong ties to the @entity39			1
’ adventurous : mr @entity78 was foiled by bad weather as he descended the @entity45 peak the @entity9 colossus stands at 14,690ft on the @entity45 - @entity83 border it was in the @entity39 that he was reunited with childhood friend @entity85 and together they took on harder and harder challenges			1
mr @entity85 said : ‘ as climbing partners we challenged ourselves on the classic routes			2
his death was hard to deal with at the time			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s quest for challenges led him to attempt one of the world ’s toughest ascents			1
but bad weather closed in on him and his climbing partner as they descended the @entity10			1
mr @entity1 disappeared and his friend had to be rescued by helicopter			1
the legendary @entity10 , pictured right in 1937 , is one of the most celebrated mountains in the world , and legendary in the sport of mountaineering			1
the @entity9 colossus stands at 14,690ft on the @entity45 - @entity83 border and with its four steep sides is one of the most photographed mountains in the world			2
but its reputation comes from being one of the most dangerous peaks for climbers , with 500 having perished attempting to reach the summit			0
in fact , so awe - inspiring is the @entity10 that no climber visited its summit until 1865 – pretty late in @entity9 terms			1
of the seven men who reached the summit in that first successful ascent of 1865 , four met their maker on the way down , courtesy of a broken rope			0
the mountain still claims a regular supply of victims @entity131 was first conquered in 1786 , while the @entity132 ( @entity134 's highest peak ) was crested as early as 1800			2
his remains were finally located by @entity45 rescue helicopter pilot @entity136 , who was flying near the peak ’s north face last month when he spotted abandoned equipment			2
searchers then discovered bones and clothing bearing the dead climber ’s name			0
the remains were taken to a forensic laboratory involved in the investigation in 1991 of ‘ @entity150 ’ , the 5,000 - year - old ice age ‘ mummy ’ also revealed by the ‘ retreat ’ of glacial ice			1
the pathologists contacted the @entity155 website and mrs @entity70 and her sister , @entity156 , travelled to @entity45 to identify their brother ’s equipment and provide dna samples			2
mrs @entity70 said : ‘ it was poignant			0
there was a mummified hand , with nails and skin , and cupped , as if it was waiting to be held			0
‘ it was 34 years on and i was holding my brother ’s hand			0
it was bittersweet but wonderful			0
it took ages for the dna results to come through but they confirmed what we already knew			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s remains have since been cremated and the family are still deciding where to scatter his ashes			1
mrs @entity70 added : ‘ it will be somewhere in the mountains he loved			0
