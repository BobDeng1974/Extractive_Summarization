from march nurses from the @entity1 will have their language skills checked before working for the @entity3 nurses from the @entity1 will for the first time have their language skills checked before working for the @entity3 , ministers will announce today			1
from march , applicants from the @entity1 will have to sit a language test if they can not prove to medical regulators that they have adequate skills to communicate with doctors and patients			1
it will finally overturn a loophole in the law which saw @entity16 block the move , claiming it would infringe strict @entity1 rules on the freedom of movement of workers			1
while the rules were changed to allow language tests for @entity1 doctors last year , they have now been extended to cover nurses , midwives , dentists , pharmacists as well as other dental professionals and technicians , from the @entity1			1
the tests for nurses and midwives will be carried out by the @entity35 , as they already are for applicants from outside the @entity1 , before foreign staff are allowed to register			1
it was not clear last night what form the @entity41 assessment would take , such as whether it would be an oral test or a written one			2
hospitals are not allowed to employ staff unless they are signed up with the @entity35 – meaning that failure to pass the language tests will ban them from @entity3 work			1
@entity1 dentists will have to prove their language skills to the @entity50 , while pharmacists will have to do the same for the @entity52			1
regulations will be laid before @entity54 today , paving the way for a @entity57 vote on the move over the next few weeks			1
with cross-party support , it is hoped the law will be changed by march			1
health minister dr @entity62 said the move was a major step forward for patient safety			2
there are concerns foreign nurses with poor @entity41 would be unable to understand instructions or even the words for numbers , so they can make up correct drug doses			2
frail patients also find it harder to explain to staff who can not speak @entity41 well that they need food , water or help to go to the toilet – or even that they are in pain			2
health minister dr @entity62 said the move was a major step forward for patient safety ( file picture ) dr @entity62 said : ‘ these new powers will make it easier for regulatory bodies to carry out checks to ensure healthcare professionals have the necessary knowledge of @entity41			2
’ hospitals recruited doctors from 27 countries last year including @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
most were used to plug desperate shortages on wards , x-ray units and in @entity103			0
figures obtained by the @entity105 show 32 out of 160 trusts recruited 321 doctors from abroad last year			0
the true number is likely to be far higher			0
separately , 2,957 doctors who trained overseas joined the @entity110 last year			0
it is not possible to say how many went on to the @entity3			0
dr @entity112 , of @entity113 , said it would take ten years to train up enough @entity116 doctors to fill the shortage			0
the @entity118 said : ‘ in the past five years we have seen a rise in @entity116 staff in the @entity3 from 88.9 per cent to 89.1 per cent			0
’ the number of nurses hired from abroad has soared in recent years as the number of @entity116 - trained nurses has failed to keep up with hospitals ’ needs			0
as many as 20,000 full - time posts – one in 20 – are vacant			0
as a result , many trusts are going overseas and hiring up to 60 at a time			0
last year no fewer than 5,778 nurses were hired by the @entity3 – a four-fold rise on the previous year			0
a mail investigation in november found hospitals are hiring hundreds of nurses from the @entity1 without properly checking their @entity41			2
healthcare regulators are already allowed to carry out language tests on staff trained outside the @entity1 – but have been prevented from doing the same for those from the continent because of @entity1 rules			1
the @entity118 said : ‘ regulatory bodies such as the @entity35 already carry out rigorous language testing of foreign healthcare professionals from outside the @entity1 , so it makes sense to allow regulatory bodies to check applicants from inside the @entity1 also			1

nursing applicants from @entity1 will have to sit language test from march
midwives , dentists and pharmacists will also have to pass test
plans will overturn loophole in law which saw @entity16 block move
the commons could be asked to vote on a law change within weeks
