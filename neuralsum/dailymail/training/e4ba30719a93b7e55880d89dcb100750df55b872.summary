losing hand : a @entity1 casino will not have to pay top poker player @entity2 £ 7.7million in winnings after a high court judge ruled his ' edge - sorting ' technique amounted to cheating @entity25 @entity24 , which owns more than 40 casinos in the @entity24 including @entity8 , had argued that the technique of ' edge - sorting ' which @entity2 used - which aims to provide the customer with an element of ' first card advantage ' - was not a legitimate strategy and that the casino had no liability to him			1
edge sorting involves observing minute details on the reverses of patterned cards , enabling the punter to identify their suit and number			0
those with sharp enough vision can eventually overcome the ' house edge ' , particularly if a croupier is tricked into altering the position of the deck			0
its lawyers told mr @entity50 that @entity2 ’s conduct defeated the essential premise of the game of baccarat so there was no gaming contract or constituted cheating			1
they said their croupier was tricked into helping @entity2 ' edge sort ' after he pretended to be a highly superstitious player with obsessive rituals			2
he successfully convinced staff to let him play repeatedly with a single pack of cards , claiming he believed it was ' lucky '			0
but the deck had a pattern suited to the ' edge reading ' con , the court heard			0
@entity2 's counsel , @entity71 , had told the court that edge - sorting involved nothing more than using information that was available to any player simply from viewing the backs of the cards which the casino chose to use and making requests of the casino - which it could accept or refuse - as to the manner in which play was conducted			1

the casino 's counsel , @entity99 , said that @entity2 was not a well - known advantage player at the time of his visit but was , in their eyes , an old vip customer and they trusted him accordingly			1
it argued that edge - sorting was not a widely known or practised way of playing baccarat in the @entity24			1
@entity2 , who was accompanied at @entity8 by another professional gambler , @entity113 , who introduced him to edge - sorting , said cheating was anathema to advantage players like him			1
champion : @entity2 lives in @entity93 and is described on the @entity119 website as ' arguably the best poker player in the world ' ' we observe the unwritten doctrine : how do i find a legal way to beat the house ? any method that could amount to cheating would breach the doctrine and cause you to be ostracised by your fellow players - we are all very careful to stay the right side of the line and we discuss advantage play strategies at length			2
' he said he was very angry when he heard the casino would not be paying out his winnings : ' i was upset as i had played an honest game and won fairly			2
' my integrity is infinitely more important to me than a big win , which is why i have brought these proceedings to demonstrate that i have been unjustly treated			0
' a spokesman for @entity143 said today : ' @entity8 is pleased with the judgment of the @entity145 today supporting its defence of a claim by mr @entity2			2
' it is our policy not to discuss our clients ' affairs in public and we very much regret that proceedings were brought against us			0
we attach the greatest importance to our exemplary reputation for fair , honest and professional conduct and today 's ruling vindicates the steps we have taken in this matter			0
' speaking through a spokesman today , mr @entity2 said : ' i am obviously disappointed with this judge 's decision			2
as i said in court , it is not my nature to cheat and i would never do anything to risk my reputation			0
' i am pleased that the judge acknowledged in court that i was a truthful witness			0
' i believe that what we did was a legitimate strategy and we did nothing more than exploit @entity8 ' failures to take proper steps to protect themselves against a player of my ability			0
' clearly today the judge did not agree			0
' lawyers for mr @entity2 were refused permission to appeal although they can renew their application to the @entity183 directly			0
