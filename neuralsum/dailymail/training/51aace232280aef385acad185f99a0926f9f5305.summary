by @entity0 ' suspicious ' behaviour : a police profile of a suspect in @entity5 's disappearance had a violent past , reported a @entity8 newspaper a police profile drawn up of a new @entity5 suspect has exposed his violent past and ‘ suspicious behaviour with children , ’ it was claimed today			1
leading @entity8 daily @entity14 said the profile had heightened police suspicions about a dead immigrant thief said to have been put in the frame over the youngster 's disappearance			1
the @entity8 paper has identified an ex worker at the @entity23 , the @entity24 holiday club where @entity25 disappeared from , as the man police believe may have kidnapped her in an act of revenge against his former employer			1
detectives are investigating the possibility he killed her after seeing the huge backlash the crime generated , reports say			1
the father - of - one , who emigrated to @entity8 from his native @entity40 off @entity41 , was convicted of theft in 1996 and told he was being sent home as punishment			1
@entity8 's then president @entity45 let him stay after granting him a pardon but he died aged 40 in a tractor accident in 2009			1
he is reported to have been sacked from the @entity23 before @entity25 disappeared on may 3 in 2007			1
@entity8 detectives are investigating @entity5 's disappearance again following a decision last month by the country 's attorney general to reopen the case , more than five years after it was shelved			1
@entity14 claimed today : ‘ @entity8 police inspectors , who studied the case and asked for its recent reopening , put together a profile of the suspect who died aged 40 in 2009 , and concluded the character traits they identified strengthened the possibility he could have been the author of the crime			1
’ the paper said the man , who it has not named , had a past ‘ marked by some episodes of violence ’ and had ‘ suspicious behaviour with children ’ but offered no more details of their claims			0
motive : the man was reportedly a former employee of the @entity23 ( pictured ) where @entity25 disappeared in may 2007			1
police believe he may have kidnapped her in an act of revenge against his former employer it also insisted the man 's family had refused to help police who are now trying to identify locations where @entity86 's body could be buried			1
@entity8 police have made no official comment on the reports although a highly - placed source has denied detectives are searching for @entity25 's body			1
the family of the latest suspect , who has been named in the @entity96 press , are threatening to sue the @entity8 state over the leaks and are insisting he is innocent			2
his brother - in - law spoke out to defend him and insisted @entity8 police had not been in contact			2
speaking outside his country home at the end of a dirt track a short drive from @entity106 where @entity25 disappeared , he said : ‘ we do not know what the police think because they have n't been in touch			2
‘ he has a mother and father and a brother and detectives may have contacted them but i do not know if that is the case			0
‘ it was a shock to us all when we read the police suspected my late brother - in - law of kidnapping and killing @entity25			0
‘ he was n't named in the newspaper reports but we knew immediately who they were talking about			0
@entity125 leads : the investigation into the disappearance of @entity25 , pictured , was reopened following a review of the case hope : the @entity131 's lawyer said that the couple , seen here with a computer generated image of how @entity25 might have looked in 2012 , are still motivated by the belief that she is still alive ‘ my sister does not want to speak about it			2
she has a young child she is trying to protect and she is obviously worried about the effect on him if it gets talked about at school			0
‘ my brother - in - law was sacked from the @entity23 and i can understand why the police would want to have a look at him , especially if they then discover he has a criminal conviction			2
but i strongly believe that if the police do consider he is a suspect in the @entity5 case , they are looking at the wrong man			0
‘ the idea he did it to get revenge on the @entity23 makes no sense at all			2
it was n't as if what happened there with him losing his job destroyed his life			0
‘ he got work elsewhere soon after			0
he was working at the time he died			0
he is not around to defend his reputation so others have to do it for him			0
our concern is making sure this does n't get any bigger			0
‘ the police will do what they have to do but we do n't want to say any more about it			0
’ a police source told weekly @entity8 newspaper ' @entity171 ' today that the theory of the @entity175 worker 's involvement in @entity25 's disappearance was ‘ worthy of note ’			1
looking for graves : one source claimed that police are now searching for possible locations where @entity86 's body could be buried but insisting nothing had been discounted , he added : ‘ all leads , including those the @entity96 least like , are being considered			1
the @entity187 ' @entity8 lawyer @entity186 insisted last month @entity188 and @entity131 had been told the new lines of inquiry being probed by @entity8 police discounted them as suspects			2
@entity8 police have made no official comment			0
the couple , from @entity195 , @entity196 , were made suspects after @entity25 disappeared but had their status as ‘ arguidos ’ removed before the case was shelved			0
they are now expected to apply to become ‘ assistantes ’ - or private prosecutors - in the case so they can assist state prosecutors coordinating the reopened investigation			0

the suspect may have kidnapped the girl as revenge against his former employers , a @entity8 paper reported
detectives are investigating the possibility he killed her after seeing the huge media coverage @entity86 's disappearance generated
