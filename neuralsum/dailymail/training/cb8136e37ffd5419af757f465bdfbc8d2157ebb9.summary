we all indulge in a few wintry treats at @entity2			0
there ’s the plum pudding , the sticky mince pies – and this year , the seasonal fresh fruit			0
an extraordinarily mild december has brought an unexpected crop of raspberries , while wild garlic is also starting to grow			1
mild : the relatively warm weather has encouraged raspberry bushes to grow fruit several months early ; horticulturalist @entity14 is pictured with a plant he found in @entity16 , @entity17 unusual : the plant was apparently ' tricked ' into thinking that it was already spring gardener @entity14 spotted a raspberry bush with red berries – and said more apples have stayed on the trees than usual			1
he said : ‘ we were stopped in our tracks when we saw a raspberry bush with lots of bright red fruits			0
‘ we all had a single refreshing and tasty out - of - season raspberry , and went home full of the joys of spring			0
delicious : mr @entity32 enjoyed the out - of - season snack on his walk through a park in @entity17 @entity36 : this wild garlic was also growing , well in advance of when it would usually appear ‘ the trees are also completely laden with apples – i ’ve never seen anything like it			1
’ mr @entity45 was leading a wildlife walk in @entity16 in @entity17			1
he said : ‘ one of the first things we spotted was the @entity51 , also called the @entity52 , and it should be fast asleep at the moment			0
then we came across some wild garlic beginning to grow			2
’ the amateur naturalist said that when cold does set in , it will have disastrous consequences because wildlife is ‘ being tricked into thinking that spring has arrived early ’			2
he added : ‘ regardless of the time of year , as soon as the soil temperature reaches @entity63 ( @entity64 ) and above , seeds will start to grow			0
harvest : an apple tree in @entity17 was laden with fruit thanks to the unseasonable warmth orchard : the fruit has appeared because of the warmth of the soil , but will probably die again soon ‘ sadly when we do experience cold temperatures , and we will , the plants that have sprouted will be killed off by the frost			1
then they will not re-grow until next spring			0
’ there have also been unseasonable reports of butterflies at @entity81 lakes in @entity82 , @entity83			0
a small tortoiseshell and a yellow brimstone butterfly were spotted despite the native species normally hibernating until march			0
a @entity88 spokesman said the normal average maximum temperature for this time of year is @entity90 ( @entity91 ) – but yesterday people in many areas saw temperatures of 12 to @entity95 ( 53 to @entity96 )			2
placid : @entity98 in @entity99 photographed by @entity100 as part of a series intended to showcase the beauty of the @entity105 coast @entity106 : another photograph by mr @entity100 shows the sea at @entity109 in @entity110 ominous : this forecast by @entity112 predicts extremely low pressure above the @entity114 on christmas day , which raises the possibility of stormy weather ominous : grey skies over @entity118 today as the south coast is hit by wet and windy weather spray : the heavy rains prompted a @entity88 weather warning due to the risk of flooding the @entity112 ( @entity112 ) , which has forecast a stormy @entity2 , is a pan-european body for predicting the weather weeks in advance			1

it was established in 1975 as a way of improving medium - term forecasts , which are generally much less reliable than short - term predictions			0
the @entity112 releases 10 - day forecasts every 12 hours , providing an early indication of weather conditions as well as warnings of extreme events			1
last year , the organisation predicted that @entity145 would hit landfall in the north - east of the @entity148 seven days before it actually did so , enabling residents to protect themselves from the effects of the superstorm			2
the spokesman said : ‘ we are currently seeing milder temperatures , we will get some cold weather creeping in but that is likely to be short lived			1
' it ’s going to be a little up and down , with odd cold patches here and there , but in general the @entity2 period should remain quite mild			0
’ forecasters say @entity114 could be in for a stormy @entity2 , however , with low atmospheric pressure bringing wind and rain			1
a model by @entity130 forecaster @entity112 shows extremely low pressure over the @entity114 on december 25 , suggesting turbulent conditions			1

@entity170 , of weather firm @entity171 , said : ‘ it looks very much like it wo n’t be a white @entity2 for most of us , with the possible exception of northern hills and mountains			2
' it ’s still a little too far off for much in the way of detail , but current indications are that the @entity2 period will be very unsettled and often wet or stormy			0
’ the @entity88 said @entity2 week was likely to be ‘ unsettled ’ , but emphasised that it is not yet possible to say exactly what the weather will be like on each day			2
this weekend will be ‘ unsettled and breezy ’ , it said , with ‘ showery and wintery conditions expected to affect most parts of the @entity114 ’			2
unsettled : @entity188 weather is set to come and go across @entity114 this week , with severe weather warning in place danger : a map of severe weather warnings issued by the @entity88 for wednesday , left , and thursday , right			1
