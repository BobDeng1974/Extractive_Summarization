the @entity8 has already pledged £ 29.5bn to the @entity3 , £ 5.5bn of which has gone into the eurozone rescue scheme			1
but it is thought the chancellor will agree to add more money to help the @entity3 go from $ 400bn ( £ 250bn ) to around $ 1trillion			2
the government is able to commit the extra £ 10bn without a vote in @entity16 but mr @entity2 said the @entity8 will only dish out the extra cash if there were ' no new vehicles or funds specific to the eurozone '			2
he also said there would be no deal unless all major non-eurozone countries signed up to give more			0
all bar the @entity26 after treasury secretary , @entity25 , said the @entity26 would not pledge any more money until the eurozone added sufficient funds to its bail - out scheme			1
it was a blow to @entity3 managing director @entity32 who told @entity34 last week that she was ' hopeful we will make progress ' this week			0
she hinted that the increase would be smaller than first thought as the ' needs now may not be quite a large			0
' ms @entity32 will now try to persuade the other major non-eurozone members : the @entity8 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 to pledge funds			0
i 'm out : @entity26 treasury secretary @entity25 , seen left with mr @entity2 , right , said he would not pledge any more money to the @entity3 until the eurozone added sufficient funds to its bail - out scheme @entity51 heavy : the chart shows the proportion of loans of all types agreed by the @entity3 , by continent , from march 2008 to december 2011 so far @entity43 and @entity41 have indicated they would be willing to broker a deal			1
the eurozone has increased its rescue funds by about £ 247bn since february despite @entity63 's @entity62 summit ending without a deal being struck			0
the @entity3 has already secured € 150bn from the 17 - member eurozone on top of its own € 800bn bail - out fund .			2

@entity26 treasury secretary will not pledge more money to @entity3 until eurozone *bolsters* funds to bail - out scheme
