the full extent of ' bin blight ' was exposed last night after a report found that the average family now has to leave four waste containers outside their home			1
as @entity7 increases its recycling of domestic waste , a survey found that nearly two - thirds of councils require households to have four or more bins and other waste containers			1
one council – @entity17 - under - @entity16 – even requires families to have nine , meaning they often litter the streets and cause obstructions for pedestrians and drivers			1
as @entity7 increases its recycling of domestic waste , a survey found that nearly two - thirds of councils require households to have four or more bins and other waste containers residents of the @entity31 borough have to sort their waste into general waste , food , cardboard , plastics , paper , glass , cans , textiles and garden waste			1
the survey was carried out by the @entity42 ( @entity43 ) as part of a report into how bins should be stored on housing developments			2
@entity48 , the think tank 's head of research and innovation , said : ' it sometimes seems as if insufficient attention is given to how bins are accommodated on new developments			2
' designers need to find practical ways to hide numerous wheelie bins and other containers			0
alternatively , the time may have come to consider more radical solutions to solve the bin blight problem – such as shared facilities on street corners or underground bin storage			1
' mr @entity48 said the era he remembered from his youth – when the ' bin man ' would go round to the back of the house to empty a steel dustbin – were long gone			0
' hardly a feeling of nostalgia , but maybe a reminder of a simpler time when the terms ' wheelie bin ' and ' bin blight ' had not yet been coined , ' he said			1
' for my household , change started in the early nineties when the dustbin was replaced with the black wheelie bin			0
over the years , we have since amassed a green one and a blue one as well as a box for paper and a small bin for food waste			0
' on the plus side , it 's great that all the stuff we chuck out no longer goes to landfill ; on the minus , @entity7 's streets are now littered with bins and containers			0
' @entity99 , the @entity100 , said yesterday the government was committed to tackling ' the scourge of bin blight ' the @entity43 's survey of 325 authorities found that two required one bin , 18 required two and 93 required three			1
four bins was the rule in 105 authorities , five in 69 , six in 33 and seven in four council areas			2
@entity17 - under - @entity16 was out on its own			1
the report said : ' the widespread adoption of wheelie bins alongside the introduction of a variety of additional bins , boxes and bags for storing waste for recycling has not been without its problems			0
uppermost amongst these are the difficulties households face in accommodating all these bins and containers			2
' terraced houses are particularly affected where there can be restricted access or no access to the rear of the property			0
' the narrow frontage and limited front garden space can also impose further constraints			0
' @entity99 , the @entity100 , said yesterday the government was committed to tackling ' the scourge of bin blight '			1
' @entity141 too many of our streets are still dominated by the ugly clutter of unsightly bins , ' he said			0
' this common sense guide , backed up by revised planning rules and building regulations , will help ensure that the housing industry raises their game when building new homes			0

nearly two - thirds of councils require households to have four or more bins
one council - @entity17 - under - @entity16 - even requires families to have nine
this means they often litter the street and obstruct pedestrians and drivers
@entity99 says @entity138 committed to tackling ' scourge of bin blight '
