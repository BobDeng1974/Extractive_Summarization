president @entity0 has received the snl treatment with a sketch that took aim at his executive order vetoing @entity5 to secure the protection of at least five million immigrants from deportation			1
the @entity9 from the educational series @entity11 ! arrives at @entity12 to explain to a student the route he makes through @entity5			1
but the lesson is disrupted by a calm , collected and smiling @entity0 who kicks him down the steps - before introducing a very laid back executive order			1
an education : @entity21 staged a mock version of @entity11 ! informing viewers how president @entity0 vetoed @entity5 with an executive order to protect five million immigrants from deportation smoking a cigarette , executive order explains he is used for simple things , like declaring holidays and creating national parks			1
that is until @entity0 reveals he will be used to grant amnesty to millions of immigrants			1
' whoa ... go hard or go home , right ? ' the flummoxed executive order remarks to the camera			1
the president then asks the student what he thinks about politics			2
' i think i want to go into the private sector , ' the boy remarks			0
' me too , ' @entity0 replies with a knowing grin			0
the sketch comes amid a furious backlash against the president 's broadcast to the nation on thursday , announcing work permits for migrants			2
and analysts claim the policy - which has been months in the making - will not have the full economic benefits that widespread reforms passed through @entity5 would have delivered			1
@entity61 sources claim @entity0 wanted to make the announcement by the end of the summer but was blocked by @entity64 fearing it could derail election hopes for candidates in conservative states			2
previously executive orders were used for simple things like announcing holidays and national parks but in the sketch @entity0 pushes the @entity73 and uses the order to make a significant change video @entity21 it was days after the party conceded an overwhelming number of congressional seats to the @entity81 that @entity0 - now a ' lame duck ' president - finally put pen to paper			1
proponents of comprehensive reform cite the benefits compulsory work permits will provide for the economy			0
' this is focused on people who are already in the economy today , who are contributing mightily but are basically operating in the shadows , ' said @entity96 , a professor at the @entity97 , @entity98			0
' their economic potential is being held back			2
' the new order could boost labor income by $ 6.8 billion , helping to generate 160,000 new jobs and $ 2.5 billion in additional tax revenues , according to estimates by @entity96			0
however , the president 's order ' falls short of a comprehensive reform that would have a more sweeping effect on the economic landscape , ' said @entity111 of the forecasting firm @entity112			1
more substantial reforms could lift economic growth by an additional 0.24 percent a year — or about $ 41 billion — for the next two decades , according to an analysis that @entity111 contributed to last year for the @entity116			0
backlash : analysts claim the move will not have the full economic impact that a bill would have delivered crowds lined the streets of @entity124 with signs thanking @entity0 for the move which was months in the making the reforms could also cut the federal debt by $ 1.2 trillion over the same period , increase home construction , lift wages and add 8.3 million workers to the economy			1
a broader overhaul would also create a framework for attracting more immigrants , which would mute the negative economic impacts of an aging population			0
as more @entity143 retire , the percentage of the population with jobs has slipped , limiting the ability of the economy to expand			0
@entity0 has also been criticized for simply protecting the current immigrant population , rather than promoting the immigration of more high - skilled workers			0
despite repeated calls to raise the 65,000 limit on ' @entity153 ' visas issued to skilled workers per year , this is not covered by the executive order			2
scientists , engineers and computer programmers all earn higher wages than the comparatively low - paid workers who would be helped by @entity0 .			0
