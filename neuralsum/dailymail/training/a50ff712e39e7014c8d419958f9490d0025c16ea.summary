the latest in a spate of e-cigarette explosions have health and fire officials warning ' vapers ' - as e-smokers have come to be known - that ' healthier ' alternatives to smoking are far from danger - free			1
firefighters in the town of @entity12 , @entity13 , responded to an incident this week where an e-cigarette erupted from its charger , launching about 25 feet from the power socket to start a fire across the room , according to @entity20			1
an e-cigarette on charge overheated and exploded across the room , causing a fire at a home in @entity12 , @entity13 , this week			1
no residents were injured and the flames were quickly put out fire officials have warned e-cigarettes are at their most dangerous while on charge			1
unlike other electronic devices , such as cellphones , they do n't have the techonology to switch off once the battery is charged , causing the coil to overheat and explode e-cigarettes , which heat liquid nicotine into a smoke - like water vapor , have skyrocketed since their introduction in 2007			2
some 250 companies are producing them and there are predictions they could outsell tobacco in a decade			0
while yearly sales were originally hitting $ 50,000 , the market now looks set to top $ 1 billion			1
most recent estimations had 3.5 million @entity49 users			0
but fire officials have warned that e-cigarette users are leaving their devices on charge too long			1
unlike other battery - operated equipment , such as cellphones , e-cigarettes do n't have an inbuilt default setting to switch off once the battery is full			0
dangerous : marks from an e-cigarette exploded at a home in @entity12 , @entity13 listen carefully : @entity64 division chief @entity63 explains why so many e-cigarettes are exploding across the nation ' those lithium - ion batteries do n't have an overcurrent protection to them , so they continue to draw on that heat until the coil overheats and the lithium - ion actually explode in the unit , ' said @entity12 fire department division chief @entity63			1
the fire is the latest of many explosions that are happening across the country			1
last month , father - of - three @entity77 said he was ' terrified ' when his e-cigarette exploded from his in - car charger onto the backseat , which was almost destroyed by an ensuing fire			1
the flames also came dangerously close to his headrest			0
@entity77 shows how his exploding e-cigarette all - but destroyed the backseat of his car			1
he said the device ' went off like a firework ' extensive : fire from an e-cigarette consumes the backseat of @entity77 ' car last month close call : the flames also threatened the front seats			1
the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) have said the problem with e-cigarettes is a combination of how new they are and their astonishingly fast rise in popularity			2
' as the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes have not been fully studied , consumers â€¦ have no way of knowing whether ( they ) are safe for their intended use , ' said @entity94 spokeswoman @entity106			0
also last month , a toddler was ' fortunate ' to escape a car fire with only minor injuries after his mother 's e-cigarette overheated and projected onto the backseat			1
his mother , @entity112 , was driving in @entity113 , @entity114 , when the coil inside her device exploded out of the casing while it was on charge in the car			0
the coil bounced off the ceiling and into the car seat of her son , @entity122 , in the back			0
' then there was a big bang , and kind of a flash , and there 's smoke everywhere , ' she told @entity132 tv station @entity131			0
@entity133 , 3 , recieved first and second degree burns to his lower back ( right ) after his mother 's e-cigarette exploded in their car , landing in his baby seat			2
relieved : @entity112 was driving in @entity113 with her son , @entity122 , when her electronic cigarette ' went bang ' in its charger looks harmless enough : huge marketing campaigns are being run to promote e-cigarettes , with some 250 companies now producing them			0
but there is still a long way to go before they are ' perfected ' @entity151 attempt to smother the flames with her sleeve , but that also caught fire			2
she then grabbed an iced coffee from the front seat and poured it on @entity159 , putting out the fire			2
the little boy received first and second - degree burns to his lower back			0
thankfully , changes have started to be made to the technology of some e-cigarettes			2
@entity167 , who owns the @entity168 , said some high - end brands have recently started to make ' overcharge protection '			0
however there are plenty of cheaper ' imitations ' available for cheaper			0
' the real @entity176 battery is made by @entity177 and they are the ones with an emblem on the bottom , ' he told @entity181 .			0
