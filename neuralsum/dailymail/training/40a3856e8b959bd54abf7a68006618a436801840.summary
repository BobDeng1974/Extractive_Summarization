a dental implant is a titanium screw that can replace the root of a tooth when it fails			0
just like a tooth root , it is placed into the jawbone and can be used to support one or more false teeth			0
the body recognises the titanium as part of itself and grows onto it , giving a bionic , living connection			0
a tooth face is placed on top of the screw for a perfect smile			0
the procedure is tried and tested , and any number of teeth can be replaced , from a single tooth to a complete set , depending on the condition of the bone in the jaw			0
most implants are fitted by private dentists because they will not be funded by the @entity11 unless there is a real medical need			1
