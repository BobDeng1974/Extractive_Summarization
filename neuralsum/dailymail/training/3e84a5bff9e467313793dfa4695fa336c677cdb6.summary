@entity19 - born @entity206 ( left ) helped cement the top political post in @entity9 into a dynasty as he is the third member of his family to lead the country in the last 65 years , after his father and grandfather			0
mr @entity8 has been leader of the @entity214 ( @entity214 ) party since february 2004 and became the 182nd prime minister of greece in october 2009			0

on the back of a huge swell of public support and an emphatic majority he promised to reinvigorate @entity9 's stuttering economy by pumping in three billion euros			1
however it then came out that the country was in much more debt than first thought so he began to cut spending , bump - up taxes and slash public sector jobs , leading to national strikes			0
fellow eurozone members also hit out at mr @entity8 , saying he failed to manage his economy properly			0
this has led to poor opinion polls and a lack of parliamentary backing			0
