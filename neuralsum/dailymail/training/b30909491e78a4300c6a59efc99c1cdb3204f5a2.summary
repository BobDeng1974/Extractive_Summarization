we all dream of living a long , happy life - often in a warmer , more relaxing climate than we are currently based			1
but where are the happiest places in the world ? a new map of 151 countries has revealed exactly which parts of the globe deliver long and happy lives for their citizens , within the environmental limits of the planet			1
and the results may surprise you , with @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 topping the league			0
the @entity21 features at position 44 - higher than @entity23 ( 47 ) , @entity24 ( 62 ) , @entity25 ( 65 ) , @entity26 ( 76 ) and the @entity27 ( 105 )			1
the map was compiled by the relocation website @entity30 , using data from the latest @entity32 ( @entity32 ) - a global measure of sustainable wellbeing			1
the @entity32 claims it ' measures what matters ' , rather than wealth : the extent to which countries deliver long , happy , sustainable lives for the people that live in them			1
each of the three component measures – life expectancy , the level of well - being experienced and ecological footprint – is given a traffic - light score based on thresholds for good ( green ) , middling ( amber ) and bad ( red ) @entity58 scores are combined to an expanded six - colour traffic light for the overall @entity32 score , where , to achieve bright green – the best of the six colours , a country would have to perform well on all three individual components each of the three component measures – life expectancy , the level of well - being experienced and ecological footprint – is given a traffic - light score based on thresholds for good ( green ) , middling ( amber ) and bad ( red ) performance			1
these scores are combined to an expanded six - colour traffic light for the overall @entity32 score , where , to achieve bright green – the best of the six colours , a country would have to perform well on all three individual components			1
in order to compile the data , researchers directly asked people in each country for their views			0
experienced well - being : this was assessed using a question called the ‘ @entity84 ’ from the @entity83			0
this asks respondents to imagine a ladder , where 0 represents the worst possible life and 10 the best possible life , and report the step of the ladder they feel they currently stand on			0
life expectancy : alongside experienced well - being , the @entity95 includes a universally important measure of health – life expectancy			2
we used life expectancy data from the 2011 @entity101 human development report ecological footprint			0
the @entity32 uses the @entity103 promoted by the environmental charity @entity104 as a measure of resource consumption			2
it is a per capita measure of the amount of land required to sustain a country ’s consumption patterns , measured in terms of global hectares ( g ha ) which represent a hectare of land with average productive biocapacity			2
two of the three main factors are directly about happiness			0
the third ( ecological footprint ) is regarded as sustainable happiness			0
i.e. whether a country could sustain its citizens without any outside help			0
the idea is that if there was an incident which cut a country completely off from the outside world , or a country had to be completely self - sufficient , most of the developed world would be unable to do that ( without losing a lot of its population first )			2
the reason for some high - income nations to score significantly below other nations is the ecological footprint left on the planet			0
the map also does n't take into account internal inequality measures and human rights issues which is why some countries like @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 feature so highly click on the interactive map below to see how each country ranks depending on @entity155 , @entity156 and ecological footprint @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 topping the happiness league			2
the map was compiled using data from the latest @entity32 ( @entity32 ) - a global measure of sustainable wellbeing the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) puts at the heart the idea that happiness is not necessarily about wealth , but living long lives with a high experience of well - being			1

four of the top five happiest places are here - with @entity17 coming top , followed by @entity18 ( third ) , @entity209 ( fourth ) and @entity210 ( fifth ) @entity211 and @entity212 have the worst scores in @entity214 , while @entity215 and @entity216 are the happiest			1
