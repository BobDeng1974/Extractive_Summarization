by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:57 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 02:47 est , 29 august 2013 deaths involving legal highs increased by 80 per cent last year – to one every week			1
figures from the @entity5 show fatalities relating to the psychoactive substances rose from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012 – compared to 22 in 2010			1
drugs such as ' meow meow ' , ' @entity8 ' and ' @entity9 ' were all legal when they were first produced , but have since been outlawed			1
danger : ' legal highs ' such as mephedrone killed 52 people in @entity16 and @entity17 last year however , banning the substances has had no effect on the number of deaths they have caused , which increased from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012 , according to the @entity5			1
among legal highs , deaths involving a substance called cathinone tripled from six in 2011 to 18 in 2012			1
the @entity27 advises the government on whether a drug should be banned or reclassified			0
this process led to new synthetic cannabinoids - such as those sold under the name @entity8 - and methoxetamine , sold as ' @entity35 ' , being made @entity37 drugs last year			2
deaths : @entity39 , left , died at a festival in @entity41 last year while @entity42 , right , collapsed and died this month ; both had taken synthetic party drugs and in june this year , @entity45 and @entity9 , two groups of legal highs , were banned for 12 months using a temporary class drug order after advice from the @entity27			1
the best - known ' legal high ' is mephedrone , known as ' @entity51 ' or ' meow meow ' , which was banned in 2010 but is still widely used as a party drug			1
casualty : 20 - year - old @entity55 died after taking mephedrone on a night out last year among those who died last year after taking synthetic drugs was @entity39 , a 19 - year - old who collapsed at a music festival in @entity41 in june soon after taking @entity9			1
another was 20 - year - old @entity55 , who died following a night out during which she snorted @entity51 given to her by friends a 15 - year - old boy , @entity64 , raped a pensioner in august after consuming a cocktail of vodka and mephedrone			2
the fatalities continued this year , as just this month football - loving teenager @entity42 died after he took a legal high called @entity72 which was imported from the @entity73			2
in its bulletin on deaths related to drug poisoning in @entity16 and @entity17 in 2012 , the @entity5 also revealed the number of deaths involving painkiller tramadol has more than doubled since 2008 to 175 in 2012			0
there were 1,706 male drug poisoning deaths - involving both legal and illegal drugs - registered in 2012 , a four per cent decrease since 2011			2
female drug poisoning deaths have increased every year since 2009 , reaching 891 in 2012 , the @entity5 said			0
the number of male drug misuse deaths involving illegal drugs decreased by nine per cent from 1,192 in 2011 to 1,086 in 2012 , while female deaths decreased by one per cent from 413 in 2011 to 410 in 2012			2
the highest mortality rate from drug misuse was in 30 - to 39 - year - olds , at 97.8 and 28.9 deaths per million population for males and females respectively in 2012			0
the number of deaths involving heroin or morphine fell slightly in 2012 to 579 deaths , but these remain the substances most commonly involved in drug poisoning deaths , the @entity5 said			0
regionally , mortality rates from drug misuse were significantly higher in @entity17 than in @entity16 in 2012 , at 45.8 and 25.4 deaths per million population respectively			0
in @entity16 , the @entity106 had the highest mortality rate from drug misuse in 2012 at 41.0 deaths per million population			0
popular : legal highs have become a massive industry feeding @entity113 's hunger for psychoactive substances legal highs have always been available in some form or another , with partygoers long using freely available substances like amyl nitrate and nitrous oxide to get a fix			1
however , the recent explosion in legal high use came with the rise in popularity of a class of drugs known as cathinones , particularly mephedrone , from 2007 onwards			2
the drug , which is chemically similar to compounds found in the khat plant of eastern @entity133 , became popular among clubbers as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for @entity136 , the active ingredient in ecstasy tablets			2
the effects of the substance have been likened to a combination of @entity136 , amphetamine and cocaine			0
it is said to have the euphoric effects of ecstasy , but with the short - lived hit of a line of coke			0
@entity51 's popularity gave rise to a whole new market for legal highs sold over the internet and when the substance was finally banned in 2010 a range of other novel synthesised drugs had sprung up to take its place			1
many of them were produced by laboratories in @entity163 and bought and imported by entrepreneurs using popular wholesale websites like @entity166			0
however their purity was difficult to ascertain			0
one legal drug which followed mephedrone in rising to popularity was 6 - @entity171 , known commonly as @entity9			1
a molecule of the same phenethylamine class as @entity136 , it marked a fresh attempt by enterprising chemists to circumvent drugs laws by slightly changing the chemical makeup of popular drugs			1
those attempts have now turned into a cat and mouse game with legislators , with chemists synthesising new substances faster them @entity185 can ban them , spawning a whole industry to feed @entity113 's hunger for mind - altering substances			0
however , unlike drugs which have been around for years and for which risks are generally well known , the long term - and indeed short term - risks many of these new substances are still a mystery .			0

52 people died from ' legal highs ' last year , up from just 29 in 2011
most popular drugs such as mephedrone and ' @entity9 ' are now banned
