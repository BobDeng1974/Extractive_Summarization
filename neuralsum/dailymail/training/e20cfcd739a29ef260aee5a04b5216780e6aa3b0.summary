by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 03:44 est , 21 february 2013 @entity1 of @entity2 returned to the day job after a relaxing holiday on the island of @entity6 today - and she looked the picture of health this morning as she attended an official engagement in @entity10 , her tiny bump highlighted with a flattering wrap dress			1
@entity1 , making her first appearance since returning from her break last week - and for the first time at an official engagement with a baby bump - chose a black and white @entity19 dress from the 2011 collection , decided to forgo a coat , despite the chill in the air , and accessorised her look with just her £ 60 @entity26 court shoes and a light tan			1
@entity1 , who was reported to be dismayed after photos of her on the beach in a bikini were published in an @entity32 magazine earlier this month , looked cheerful and relaxed as she chatted to staff at @entity34 , a residential centre in @entity36 set up to help recovering addicts			1
at four and a half months pregnant , she is still remarkably slender apart from her tiny bump - clearly @entity39 has n't been eating for two			2
picture of health : @entity1 of @entity2 looked relaxed as she attended an engagement for one of her charities , @entity44 , at @entity34 in @entity10 today , though at times she seemed protective of her bump , clasping her hands in front back on duty : @entity39 met clients and staff at @entity34 , a 23 - bed residential treatment centre in @entity36 @entity39 chose a graphic print wrap dress - very similar in style to an @entity55 or @entity56 design - a savvy choice during pregnancy			1
' a wrap dress is the perfect style to wear as a maternity dress , ' a spokesperson from fashion news site fashionfreude.com told @entity64			0
' the silk jersey fabric is cool and comfortable and there are no tight waistbands around the middle , and with slim @entity39 's bump not likely to grow at the sort of rate that @entity73 's is advancing , there 's every likelihood she will be able to keep wearing this sort of dress right up until the end			1
' spotlight : @entity39 hit the headlines today after @entity81 - winning author @entity80 criticised her for being ' plastic ' and ' painfully thin ' - but today she looked slender , yes , but healthy and glowing blossoming : at four and a half months pregnant - almost halfway through - the @entity1 's bump was just beginning to show stylish : @entity39 's simple wrap dress revealed a small bump - and also @entity39 's tanned legs following the @entity1 's luxury break in @entity6 with @entity86 and the @entity87 warm - hearted : @entity1 of @entity2 made two youngsters happy when she accepted their bouquet of flowers after she visited the charity she supports demure : @entity39 made sure she did n't show too much cleavage by using a so - called modesty panel across the v - neck of the wrap dress ' despite the frost on the ground , glowing @entity39 is doing the typical starlet trick of turning up to an event without a coat which is surprising considering she is pregnant and has just returned from a tropical break			1
aside from the lack of winter wear and the just - visible baby bump , she ’s sticking to classic @entity39 style – the belted waist , sheer tights and black courts from episode at @entity26 ( £ 60 ) are all looks we ’ve seen several times before			2
a long - sleeved wrap dress is a sensible wardrobe staple for many working women , just sling it on and you ’re camera ready in seconds			0
it 's the perfect maternity style as it ’s not fitted and can be let out as your bump grows			0
@entity39 has accessorised hers with a ‘ modesty panel ’ to keep her cleavage under wraps			2
this being the @entity1 , she ’s showing off perfect hair and make - up , but interestingly , she appears to have already said ‘ so - long ’ to the fringe she recently had cut			2
bearing in mind @entity39 has a hairstyling team at her beck and call , this is proof that bangs are seriously high maintenance ! ' @entity39 's glossy hair looked healthier than ever too - thanks no doubt to a good dose of the friendlier pregnancy hormones			0
the unruly fringe that flopped into her face for a few weeks at the end of last year was well on its way to growing out , and the rest looked bouncy and shiny			0
@entity39 spent the morning meeting clients and staff at @entity34 , a 23 - bed residential treatment centre in @entity10 that offers an @entity44 programme , providing a safe , comfortable place for women to recover from substance dependence and receive support for other compulsive disorders			1
glossy : @entity39 's chestnut hair was blowdried into tumbling waves - and the heavy fringe she had cut in at the end of 2012 was close to growing out bejewelled : tanned @entity39 accessorised her outfit with the diamond button pendant , £ 2,800 by @entity161 jewellers @entity160 , and pearl earrings and her trademark glossy blow dry looked bouncier than ever ' with its discreet purple centre and engraved ' 167 ' address , the @entity160 button is a stylish signature inspired by buttons on old @entity171 garments , ' @entity160 say of the piece of jewellery worn by @entity39 today - though whether it was a trick of the light , @entity39 's centre stone looked to be more ruby - toned that the traditional purple luxury : was the necklace , on sale for £ 2,800 , on the @entity160 website , a gift from @entity183 ? @entity56 1974 new @entity185 dress , £ 300 , matchesfashion.com @entity186 £ 316 , mytheresa.com @entity187 £ 75 @entity188 £ 80 , @entity26 @entity189 £ 60 ( sale price ) at @entity191 @entity192 , £ 325 , matchesfashion.com glossy : @entity39 's hair looked thicker and bouncier than ever ' @entity39 's hair is undoubtedly benefiting from her upcoming baby joy			1
pregnancy usually reduces the normal rate of hair loss , resulting in thicker looking , more lustrous locks			0
@entity202 that with the general improved lifestyle choices when you 're pregnant such as less alcohol and general nasties and your hair can look better than ever			0
@entity39 's fringe has probably grown out quicker than it would have sans impending baby , as the rate of hair growth can also increase			0
perfect timing as a lower maintenance mane will be welcomed when she 's changing nappies ! ' -- @entity214 , creative director of @entity215 , @entity10			0
