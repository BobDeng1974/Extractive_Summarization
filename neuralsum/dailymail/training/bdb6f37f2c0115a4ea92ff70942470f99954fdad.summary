by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:23 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 31 october 2013 the @entity3 energy firms have tightened their grip on customers , with the number of people switching to rival firms at a record low			1
as ministers pin their hopes of driving down prices by boosting competition , official figures reveal that the number of people choosing to switch has halved in two years			2
in june this year just 341,000 customers change gas or electricity supplier , compared to almost 800,000 in summer 2011			1
slump : just 341,000 people changed gas and electricity supplier in june this year , less than half of the numbers who switched in summer 2011 the revelation is a bitter blow to ministers who have held up switching as the main – and possibly only – way to beat another round of crippling price rises			1
four of the @entity3 firms have already announced big price rises for this winter			1
@entity36 bills are going up by 9 per cent , @entity34 announced a 10.4 per cent price hike , @entity40 a 9.2 per cent rise and @entity38 an 8.2 per cent increase			0
the government has come under intense pressure to act on soaring bills , after @entity46 leader @entity45 pledged to freeze bills and former @entity49 prime minister sir @entity48 demanded a windfall tax on power company profits			2
today energy secretary @entity52 again put switching at the heart of the government ’s response to rising costs			1
crackdown : energy secretary @entity52 wants to make energy companies ' profits more transparent he revealed he wants customers to be able to change supplier within just 24 hours , although only a small independent supplier has suggested this is possible			1
he told @entity62 he recently saved £ 240 from switching			2
‘ at the moment it can take over five weeks which is completely ludicrous and we ’ve seen in the banking sector the government managed to reduce it down to seven days and i really want to bare down on that and reduce it to a very small amount of time ; my ambition is to get it down to 24 hours			1
‘ we ’ve got to work with the industry to deliver that , but i ’ve already talked to one of the leading independent suppliers who believes they can get it down to 24 hours , but we ’ve got to make sure the other players are in there			1
i really think we can make a massive change here			2
’ but latest figures released by his department reveal switching is heading in the wrong direction			2
in june this year 193,000 people switched electricity supplier and 148,000 changed gas company			1
on average it is down more than a quarter on the same time last year , and much lower than before the 2008 recession when people had more money to spend			0
mr @entity52 admitted his plan to cut the time it takes to switch will take ‘ some time to deliver ’ and warned it was only the internet - savvy ‘ smart - phone generation ’ who get the best deals			1
the price hikes will add £ 50 to every family 's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £ 100 in a statement to the @entity110 today he will announce plans to force energy firms to ‘ open their books ’ and be fined if price hikes are found to be uncompetitive			1
the @entity116 will outline an annual ‘ competition test ’ , under which energy firms will have to declare profits from different arms of their business to make their margins more transparent			1
mr @entity52 will also outline measures to help smaller suppliers break into the market offering lower prices than the @entity3			1
there are 15 smaller suppliers currently , but they only serve 1 per cent of customers			0
it comes as official figures yesterday revealed the cost of gas to families has almost tripled – rising by a staggering 190 per cent – in just ten years			0
average energy bills have more than doubled , increasing by 120 per cent in the same period , according to the @entity136			0
in contrast , the cost of most household goods and services rose by around 30 per cent between 2003 and 2013			0
