according to scientists , a pioneering way to remove unsightly chin fat has had promising results in early trials			2
four injections of an agent known as @entity12 - 101 into the chin led to the production of cells that ‘ gobbled up ’ spare fat which was reabsorbed into the body			1
a pioneering way to remove unsightly chin fat has had promising results in early trials			0
four injections of an agent known as @entity12 - 101 into the chin led to the production of cells that ' gobbled up ' spare fat , which was reabsorbed into the body the ‘ happiness rating ’ of patients with their new appearance doubled after treatment , compared with a ‘ dummy ’ agent			1
@entity27 , of the @entity28 , said : ‘ this research is a very exciting step towards a safe and non-surgical solution to removing unwanted chin fat			2
‘ for people experiencing negative psychological effects of this unwanted fat on their appearance , this procedure , if approved , may open up the option of minimally invasive treatment with proven efficacy			0
’ at present , people who are unhappy with a double chin - or more - can turn to liposuction or have neck and face lifts to get rid of the excess			2
the ' happiness rating ' of patients ( not pictured ) with their new appearance doubled after treatment , compared with a ' dummy ' agent			0
but these treatments are not suitable for everyone , and the need for anaesthesia , an operating room and qualified staff substantially increases costs and risks			0
there are other non-surgical approaches available , including the non-invasive use of vacuum therapy to break up pockets of fat combined with @entity63 to encourage tightening afterwards			0
however , a limited number of clinical trials have been published showing the effectiveness of the various techniques			0
the new treatment targets unappealing fat deposits beneath the chin , otherwise known as submental fat , or more colloquially as a ‘ double chin ’			1
dermatologists from the @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 investigated the effect of injections of @entity82 - a synthetically derived form of the bile acid , deoxycholic acid - into the fat			1
@entity82 reduces submental fat by irreversibly disrupting fat cell membranes and causing destruction of fat cells			1
the injections trigger an inflammatory response that promotes the arrival of highly specialised cells called macrophages into the chin fat			2
these ‘ gobble up ’ the debris resulting from destruction of the fat cells over time , with the unwanted fat being reabsorbed into the body			2
in the trial , 363 men and women aged 18 to 65 had four injections four weeks apart of the active agent or a dummy placebo , says a report published in the @entity108			0
only those with moderate to severe submental fat who expressed dissatisfaction with the appearance of their face and chin were eligible to take part			1
the findings showed significantly more @entity12 - 101 recipients had improvements in 5 - point fat ratings scale by a doctor and by themselves on a 7 - point satisfaction scale			1
the trial used two different dosages of @entity82 as well as a placebo			0

but these treatments are not suitable for everyone , and the need for anaesthesia , an operating room and qualified staff increases costs and risks with the higher dosage of @entity82 , 65 per cent of patients had a reduction in submental fat of at least one point on the fat rating scale compared with 23 per cent with the placebo			2
two thirds patients were happy with their face and chin appearance , versus 29 per cent for the placebo			0
in addition , measurements using a calliper showed a significant reduction in submental fat , with no apparent worsening of skin looseness			1
following treatment , patients also reported a reduction in the psychological impact they felt due to the appearance of their face and chin			0
the treatment was found to invoke just a mild inflammatory response and the procedure was well tolerated by patients			0
lead author professor @entity163 said ‘ this study demonstrates that subcutaneous injections with @entity12 - 101 yield a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in unwanted submental fat , decrease the psychological impact on patients , and are well tolerated			1
‘ this study and three additional @entity171 clinical trials of @entity82 will provide the first true evidence base for non-surgical submental fat reduction			1
