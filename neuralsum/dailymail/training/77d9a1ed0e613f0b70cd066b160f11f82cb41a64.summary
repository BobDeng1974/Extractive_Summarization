by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 knows all too well what is on the line when his side face @entity7 for a place in the group stages of the @entity10			1
the @entity12 head to @entity13 for the first leg of their play - off tie looking to maintain their record of reaching @entity20 's elite club competition for each of the last 16 campaigns			1
it is , of course , not all just about prestige , with each @entity10 home match estimated to bring in around £ 3million of additional revenue not to mention lucrative prize money which kicks off at some 8.6 million euro ( £ 7million ) for successful qualification			2
not like last time : at this stage last year @entity3 eased past @entity31 but @entity2 knows it wo n't be easy confidence : @entity2 hopes that the @entity12 can build momentum from their @entity35 win @entity3 breezed through what was last season a potentially tricky tie against @entity31 , coming away from @entity13 with a 3 - 0 victory before winning 2 - 0 back at the @entity39			1
@entity2 , though , is taking nothing for granted against @entity42 's well - organised outfit , who defeated @entity44 5 - 2 on aggregate in the third - round with former @entity48 striker @entity47 netting a hat - trick in the second leg			2
' i believe it will be a very tough game and a very important one for us			0
we want to be in the @entity10 group stage , ' said @entity2			2
' @entity7 had a convincing result against @entity44 , and so for us we have the luck to play the first game away			0
tough task : @entity2 is pleased to be playing the second leg at home against a strong @entity7 side new signing : @entity64 star @entity63 has arrived at the @entity39 keen to make a big impact absent : neither @entity66 or @entity67 are likely to be fit for the trip to @entity69 after their @entity71 exploits ' we know what is at stake of course and want to be highly focused for this game			1
' @entity7 ' @entity78 ground is being redeveloped , so tuesday night 's match will take place at the 72,000 - seater @entity81 , where @entity82 famously beat @entity83 in the 2005 @entity10			1
@entity84 - born @entity3 midfielder @entity67 is of @entity69 descent , but unlikely to get the chance to play in the first leg as he has only just returned from an extended break following the @entity71			1
@entity3 added @entity64 forward @entity63 , @entity90 international defender @entity89 , promising young centre - back @entity91 and @entity93 goalkeeper @entity92 to the squad over the summer			0
impressive : @entity95 starred in the @entity35 win against @entity97 full - back @entity95 is confident the @entity12 have the strength in depth to make an impact on all fronts this season			0
' more players have arrived than departed and so the squad looks deeper than in previous seasons , ' he wrote in a blog on @entity108			0
' there is now more competition for places , which is important for the team throughout the year			0
' hopefully , everyone can stay fit and well , because it should raise the performance of each individual player			0
