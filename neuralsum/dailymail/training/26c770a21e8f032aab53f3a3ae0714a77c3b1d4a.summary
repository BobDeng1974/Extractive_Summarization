by @entity0 published : 22:13 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 10:34 est , 3 april 2012 homeowners are facing more misery with the announcement that the @entity4 is the latest provider to push up the cost of its lending , as experts fear more could follow suit			1
the self - proclaimed ' ethical lender ' joins @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 and @entity15 banks in raising its standard variable rate , which will rise to 4.74 % in may			2
the co-op 's move is a further warning sign that more lenders may push up their monthly payments , despite the @entity22 maintaining the base rate at a historic 0.5 % low			2
price hikes : more homeowners are facing misery with the announcement that the @entity4 are the latest provider to push up its cost of lending @entity4 are the latest bank to follow a round of increases			1
lenders to have announced rises in svrs in recent weeks include : @entity13 and @entity15 banks will increase their standard variable rates ( svrs ) from 4.59 % to 4.95 % from may 1 , affecting 30,000 customers			2
@entity40 - @entity39 said it is pushing up rates on two of its products - the offset and the @entity46 - by 0.25 % , taking them to a rate of 4 % , affecting around 200,000 customers			2
@entity11 announced that some 850,000 borrowers will see their mortgage costs increase as the @entity37 rises from 3.5 % to 3.99 % from may 1			2
the @entity12 also announced that it is increasing its @entity37 , affecting 100,000 @entity52 customers			2
it will raise the @entity37 on its mortgages to 4.49 % from 2.99 % in two stages			0
what does @entity56 variable rates mean ? standard variable rates are the generic term for what borrowers typically revert to when a fix or tracker deal period runs out and the vast majority have no lock to base rate , so can move independently of @entity22 changes			2
@entity68 from @entity69 said ' i ’d be very surprised if we do n’t see other lenders following the lead set by these banks			0
' it was a case of all quiet on the @entity76 for a long time but now we ’ve had four lenders announce a hike in their @entity37 in as many weeks - five if you include @entity40 / @entity39 increasing the rates on its offset and one account mortgages , ' he added			0
around 54,000 @entity4 customers will now face the 0.5 % increase - meaning payments will typically go up by around £ 15 a month , or £ 180 a year			1
the average borrower has a remaining balance of £ 48,000 and 11.5 years left on their term would see their monthly repayment increase from £ 440 to £ 455 a month			0
the bank has blamed changing conditions in the mortgage market and the increased cost of funding for the rise			1
the other lenders have used the same excuse after announcing they were also raising rates in late february and march			0
experts say homeowners are already squeezed and the move will pile on the pressure to thousands of homeowners			0
the hikes have previously been branded ' shocking ' by the @entity105			1
in reaction to the hike , a which ? spokesperson said : ' at a time when people 's household budgets are already squeezed , providers increasing the standard variable rate on mortgages will pile the pressure on thousands who have been relying on low base rates to keep their homes affordable			0
' borrowers will be hit hard but lenders in an uncompetitive market know many people have no means to escape these rate hikes			0
people have effectively become mortgage prisoners because they are unable to move to another provider , ' he added			1
the @entity128 said it recognised that some customers who have a higher loan - to - value ( @entity131 ) on their mortgage may be ' particularly concerned ' about the change and measures have been put in place to offer alternative options			1
the bank is launching a new product specifically for those customers with a higher ltv who are seeking an alternative , which is a five - year fixed rate mortgage , available at the same rate they currently pay			1
squeeze on homeowners : the bank has blamed changing conditions in the mortgage market and the increased cost of funding for the rise the @entity128 also offers other products including fixed rate and tracker mortgages			1
earlier this month , the financial regulator warned that homeowners in their 50s are sitting on ‘ a ticking timebomb ’ of mortgages handed out during the boom years			1
during a grilling by @entity161 , @entity158 , a director of the @entity159 , raised his fears about interest - only mortgages which are coming to the end of their life – but the homeowners have no money to pay off the loan			0
of the 11.2million mortgages in @entity52 , about four in ten are interest - only , meaning the homeowners pay only the interest but not a penny of the actual loan			0
between 2011 and 2020 , the @entity159 expects about 1.5million such mortgages – worth a staggering £ 120billion – ‘ will be due for repayment ’			1
mr @entity158 told the treasury select committee : ‘ there is a ticking timebomb that has been created over the last 20 years			0
’ the @entity159 said its figures mean 150,000 interest - only mortgages will come to the end of their life every year for the next decade			0
the vast majority of people with these types of loans – 80 per cent – have ‘ no repayment strategy ’ , the @entity159 said			1
others have been saving , but have been bitterly disappointed by how their investments have performed			0
@entity192 , from the independent mortgage advisers , @entity189 and @entity190 , warned some mortgage holders ‘ will potentially have nowhere to go ’			1
they also face new age restrictions , which means they will not be given a new loan unless it ends before they reach the age of 75			0
it means a homeowner in their late 50s would not be able to take out another 25 - year loan			0
lenders are running up rates with the excuse of higher funding costs , but this is really about boosting margins and those borrowers unable to jump ship as their equity has declined due to falling house prices will now be stuck on higher @entity215 standard variable rates are considerably above the 1.03 per cent money market @entity218 measure of floating rate funding and the 3 per cent needed to be offered to pull in easy access savings cash.in their defence , lenders are suffering higher regulatory costs - as the @entity223 argued here - but the financial system is also awash with cheap @entity226 0.5 per cent base rate has been here for three years , @entity52 taxpayers alone have pumped £ 325bn in through quantitative easing , and now @entity231 taxpayers are funding another £ 1trillion in cheap cash for the banking industry through the @entity234 .			1
