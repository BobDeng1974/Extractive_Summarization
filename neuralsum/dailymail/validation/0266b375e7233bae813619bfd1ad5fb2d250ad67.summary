if @entity1 wanted to demonstrate that he is taking little notice of the outpouring of criticism that has greeted perhaps the worst of all @entity7 ’s many under - achieving @entity6 then he made a good job of it			1
the unthinkable possibility of a first - round elimination will become reality if @entity7 lose to @entity13 here on monday , yet the @entity7 captain talked as if nothing has been learnt from three abysmal defeats			1
the subject of @entity7 ’s over-reliance on statistics has become the hot topic of a long week of introspection in @entity23 but @entity1 does not seem to have noticed , judging by his first answer in saturday 's pre-match interrogation			2
@entity26 of @entity7 takes a catch during an @entity7 nets session at the @entity29 @entity7 's @entity30 takes a catch during an @entity7 nets session on saturday @entity7 know they can not afford a slip - up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face @entity13 ‘ having a break has given us time to reflect and the analysis has come through which backs up our feel of what happened during the @entity39 game , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ it makes things a lot clearer moving forward			0
’ well , to put it simply , @entity7 were thrashed by @entity39 in @entity45 by nine wickets with 16 balls remaining , when 309 became not nearly enough			2
does it need analysis to tell @entity1 that @entity7 under - estimated what a winning score would be and then bowled like drains ? also , the key statistics in @entity55 ’s @entity54 are 10 , 10 , 10 and 6 , his scores since being parachuted in to the side at the expense of @entity59 on the eve of @entity7 ’s first @entity54 game against @entity62			1
@entity7 warm up during a nets session at the @entity29 where they will meet @entity13 @entity64 ( left ) is held back at the @entity29 as he and his team - mates get prepared yet unless @entity1 was being disingenuous to protect his man yesterday @entity7 , who tinkered with their team the day before the tournament , are now perversely going to be stubborn and again ignore the claims of @entity30			1
‘ the decision we made to put @entity55 at three was a huge one , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ there was n’t much between him and @entity30 at the time and it was just a feel we had			0
it is a big decision to change anyone in the side and it wo n’t be taken lightly nor quickly			0
’ no one is doubting that @entity79 has a bright future but right now , when @entity7 ’s need is most acute , he looks rusty and short of the dynamism needed at this tournament			2
if @entity7 really are determined not to pick @entity30 — and every indication here is that deep down they do not think he is the answer — then perhaps @entity59 comes back into the frame with @entity88 returning to three			0
that would give @entity7 an all - important extra bowling option if their preferred tactic of bombarding the opposition with short deliveries from @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 does not work again			1
@entity59 ( right ) and @entity1 of @entity7 look on during an @entity7 nets session at the @entity29 defeat by @entity13 in @entity23 would pile the pressure on @entity7 coach @entity100 @entity7 have endured some rotten @entity6 since they went close in 1992 and must beat @entity13 the big two of @entity94 and @entity95 are just as big a worry as @entity55 at three			1
both have taken just two wickets in this @entity54 and their return in tandem for the first time in one - day cricket in two years has not been the bowling panacea @entity7 were counting on after losing in @entity39			1
‘ it ’s a difficult one really , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ they are exceptional bowlers but have not been putting the ball consistently in the right areas and have n’t been able to take early wickets			0
’ @entity7 need all their under - performing players to come through now			2
they should beat @entity13 — who gained an unexpected point when their game against @entity62 in @entity119 was rained off — at the @entity29 to keep their @entity54 flame just about flickering			1
however , upsets do happen and @entity13 have the ammunition to cause one			0
the simple truth is , at the moment , @entity7 do not look good enough to challenge the best teams here			0
and they do n’t need an analyst to tell them that .			0

@entity7 face @entity13 at @entity54 on monday at *3.30am* *gmt*
@entity100 knows his team can not afford a slip - up or rainy day
@entity7 must beat @entity13 then @entity133 to have a chance
