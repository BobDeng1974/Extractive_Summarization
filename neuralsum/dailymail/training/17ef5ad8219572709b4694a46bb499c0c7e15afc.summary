by @entity0 published : 10:57 est , 21 february 2013 @entity2 : 10:57 est , 21 february 2013 there are four insurmountable problems no marriage can survive , according to a leading divorce expert			1
and just having an affair is n't one of them			2
blogging on the @entity12 , psychotherapist and author @entity10 said cheating on a spouse is often just a symptom of one of four deeper underlying issues - issues which , she says , are the ones to ultimately end a marriage			1
there are four problems no marriage can survive , according to divorce expert @entity10 @entity10 - who describes herself as a collaborative divorce coach , a parent educator and collaborative trainer - outlines these marital dead - ends as : partners ceasing to be partners ; chronic complaining and blame - throwing ; narcissism and addiction			1
she explains ... ceasing to be partners : when one partner feels the other is immature , irresponsible , untrustworthy or selfish , the marital dynamic will crumble , destroying intimacy and sexual attraction			2
one partner will then ' detach '			2
domestic abuse is the most extreme version of this			0
there 's often no turning back from detachment , so it 's important to recognize and start marriage counseling before breaking point			1
a marriage counselor ca n't manufacture a connection , only strengthen it			1
domestic abuse is the most severe form of ' detachment ' , when one partner no longer feels equal to the other chronic complaining and blame - throwing : when marital problems are not resolved to the satisfaction of both , resentment builds - and this erodes relationships			1
solving a problem by compromise is more important than being ' right '			0
individuals who can not accept accountability are doomed to fail in relationships			0
narcissism : everyone is narcissistic to some extent , but this is problematic when partners are unable to empathise with each other and instead compete over issues such as who works harder , who spends more time with the children , who had a tougher day			0
when partners do n't understand the other 's contribution , each assume the other has it easier and neither feels understood			0
a problem with addiction - be it to drugs , gambling or alcohol - will always take priority over marriage and family addiction : addiction will always be an addict 's main focus above marriage and family , and their partner will feel angry and embarrassed by their lack of consideration for others			2
if a user is unable to give up their habit they will shift blame onto their partner , who may try to hold the relationship together for a while - especially if children are involved - but will eventually give up if there is no recovery			0
parents will often try to stay together for the sake of their children , but once these four problems have run too deep there is little hope for a marriage @entity10 explains it is important to correct marital issues before they become habitual behaviours and are imposible to change			1
she says : ' it 's difficult for couples to change long - standing relationship patterns by themselves because people tend to argue for their own points of view			0
communication does n't get anywhere without a neutral perspective			0
patterns must be recognized and interrupted			0
