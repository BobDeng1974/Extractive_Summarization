by @entity0 the perfect age for a woman to start a diet is 32 – @entity5 ’s age - according to new research			1
women of that age - including singer @entity8 - find it easiest to lose weight and stick to a diet plan			2
for men the best age to diet is 31 – the same age as prince @entity15			1
the best age for a woman to diet is 32 - @entity5 's age - the best for a man is 31 - prince @entity15 's age both sexes said their early 30s was the optimum time for weight loss because turning 30 was a watershed moment in their lives and they wanted to stay fit and healthy as they leave their 20s			1
people are less likely to stick to diets in their mid- 30s and 40s because they are not so bothered about their appearance as ageing takes its toll and they embrace middle age , according to 54 per cent of dieters			1
almost six out of ten slimmers - 59 per cent - said that diets are more likely to go awry in the 20s because people are more likely to be single and to party more			0
the findings come from a survey of 1,000 male and female slimmers by the diet company @entity46			0
the overwhelming majority of those polled - 82 per cent - said that 30 was a ' watershed ' age for both sexes and they were more likely to stick to diets afterwards			1
more than a third of female respondents - 37 per cent - found the ages of 30 to 35 the best to slim			0
women are more likely to stick to diets in their early 30s because turning 30 is seen as a watershed moment and they want to feel fit and healthy as they leave their 20s			1
@entity8 is the optimum age - 32 amongst this group 32 was the ideal age for women			0
another factor making it the optimum for women to slim is the likelihood that they had become mothers			0
the average age of women giving birth in the @entity69 is now a few weeks short of 30 - while first time mothers are older than ever at 28			1
losing baby weight is a powerful incentive for women to slim with 56 per cent saying they had found it easier to lose weight after childbirth than before			0
marriage was also a factor in helping women to lose weight			0
four out ten female respondents - 42 per cent - said they found it easier to lose weight after marrying because they are less likely to drink and eat to excess			0
the average age for a new bride in the @entity69 is 30			0
for men , 36 per cent said the ages of 30 to 35 were the most effective years to diet - with 31 the optimum age			1
men 's ideal age was a year less than women 's because turning 30 was seen as a bigger watershed for them			1
@entity46 managing director @entity93 said : ‘ there is no doubt that turning 30 is a big moment for both sexes			2
‘ the ageing process starts to catch up with us all and both sexes are desperate to turn back the clock			0
‘ they are both in the right frame of mind to diet - and that 's why they are both better able to lose weight around that age			2
‘ this is certainly true of the typical @entity46 dieter who is a young mum in her early 30s keen to lose a bit of weight after starting a family			2

the best age for men to start a diet at is 31 - prince @entity15 's age
the early 30s are the best time for dieting as turning 30 is a ' watershed '
when people are in their 20s they *struggle* to diet *due* to more partying
as they get older they tend to become less *concerned* about their looks
so , the 40s and *50s* are not ideal for dieting as people lack motivation
