on thursday night in @entity1 , @entity2 , three sprinters broke the 10 - second barrier for the 100 metres : @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity4 ’s 9.80secs was the quickest time in the world this year			1
it should have been a cause for celebration , but it left only a sickening , churning feeling			2
there is little entertainment in watching sport when you do not care about the winner			2
all three sprinters , after all , have returned to track and field after serving drugs bans			1
all three have never said ‘ sorry ’			2
they just swanned back into the sport and let their fast times do the talking			2
three cheats : @entity4 , @entity6 and gay all ran under ten seconds on thursday after serving drugs bans example : @entity4 poses with young fans after setting the fastest time in the world this year a near - capacity crowd in @entity1 applauded , kids queued for autographs and the world just stood back and watched it happen			1
@entity36 is so desperate for heroes — particularly in a year in which @entity38 has yet to light up a track — that its marquee event has been reduced to a circus			2
thursday night was an evening that shamed the sport			1
@entity4 was given an eight - year ban that might have been life after failing a second drugs test in 2006 , but saw it cut to four years — giving him ample time to come back and win 100m bronze at @entity50			1
he referred only to his ‘ indiscretions ’ , then spoke about his ‘ struggles ’ , ‘ stresses ’ and the ‘ journey ’ he has been on			2
anyone would think he was the victim , rather than the perpetrator			2
gay adopted a similar tone about his year away from the sport , grassing up anyone he could to receive a back - dated , 12 - month ban for testing positive for anabolic steroids three times last june			1
unrepentant : @entity4 has never apologised for his doping offenses which say him banned for four years visited the wonderful @entity66 museum in @entity1 , where @entity69 ’s @entity68 ’s name is etched on the steps after she helped light the flame at @entity50			1
@entity73 , now 18 , then ran in the @entity75 meeting that evening			1
there ’s @entity66 legacy for you			0
watched @entity80 ’s stunning display to win the @entity81 singles title , then realised a 55 - minute , one - sided final played right into the hands of those who do not think women merit equal prize money			0
the sport badly needs more rivalries and personalities			0
thought how wonderful it was to hear people casually chatting about cycling thanks to the beautiful pictures from the @entity94			0
it ’s a sport which can get bogged down with technicalities , but a trip to @entity98 worked wonders for bringing it back down to earth			0
we will probably never know exactly how @entity5 ‘ helped the authorities ’ to gain such an apparently lenient sentence , but one thing is for sure : it did not involve accepting any accountability			1
@entity6 , too , initially provided ‘ inaccurate and misleading testimony ’ after testing positive for a banned stimulant in july 2011 , before finally ‘ accepting full responsibility ’ and a nine - month ban that ended conveniently before the 2012 @entity112 @entity66 trials			1
@entity6 has since also morphed back into the sport			1
the thing that really grates is the utterly brazen , swaggering attitude to such flagrant breaches of the rules			0
the return to four - year bans for ‘ serious doping offences ’ in 2015 should help , but at the moment cheats seem to drift in and out of the sport apparently at will			1
they are there in almost every race , with their illegally - won honours scratched out and the dirty dollars in prize money reluctantly handed back , ready to go again without a word of explanation to the world			1
hero : men 's sprinting has welcomed cheats back into the fold , perhaps because of a lack of other options admiration : fans will warm to @entity4 and his fellow cheats despite their bans , if they keep running fast the @entity146 received 172 complaints after commentator @entity148 ( right ) said @entity2 ’s @entity150 ‘ should have put a skirt on ’ after a particularly weak shot at goal			1
i do n’t know about sexist , i ’d say it was just plain stupid : it ’s an absolute hassle attempting to do any kind of sport in a skirt , @entity159			0
@entity36 is caught in a cycle of self - harm , whereby each positive drugs test drives another nail deep into the the sport , yet must be exposed to send out a message that cheats will never prosper			0
these same cheats are then largely welcomed back with apparently open arms — as long as they keep running quickly			0
i am not such an idealist as to suggest nobody deserves a second chance			0
young , ambitious athletes can make mistakes and more experienced competitors can put their trust in the wrong people , but humility must follow such transgressions			0
there must be some acceptance that what they did was wrong			0
otherwise , the vital trust between spectator and athlete will continue to be eroded			0
video gay back from drugs ban other way : @entity189 , who won the @entity69 title again last week , has apologised for his drug use reigning @entity69 100m champion @entity193 also served a doping ban , but the sickening feeling that followed @entity4 ’s win in @entity1 did not greet the 36 - year - old ’s victory in @entity199 eight days ago			1
the only arrogance left in him is a sprinter ’s deep belief in his own ability			0
he cheated , he was caught , he told the truth and now , more than a decade on , he is still winning and winning clean			0
there is something admirable in that			0
yet @entity189 is still lumped in with the @entity211 and @entity212 of this world , the ‘ former drugs cheats ’ whose deceit continues to rile			2
and the really sad thing is we largely let them get away with it .			0

@entity4 set world 's fastest time of 9.80secs on thursday
@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 all ran under 10 seconds
all three have served drug bans but none have admitted *guilt*
gay and @entity4 have both seen bans shortened in recent years
