the @entity0 discovered , upon preparing to release a prisoner who had served a 13 - year sentence in july 2013 , that the prisoner had never been incarcerated and promptly sent him to prison			1
in the intervening 13 years since his 1999 arrest , @entity8 ' @entity7 , 36 , has transformed his life , becoming a master carpenter , starting his own business and marrying and having children			1
in july last year , as he and his youngest daughter slept in the @entity14 home he built for his family , a swat team outfitted in tactical gear and helmets swarmed the house , arresting the terrified father of four and delivering him to the @entity0 , where he 's been ever since			1
13 years late : @entity21 is currently nine months into a 13 - year prison sentence for a crime committed in 1999 now , @entity7 is fighting to be released from prison , where he 's nine months into the original 13 - year sentence			1
the @entity27 reports that it appears some kind of clerical error is responsible for @entity7 's predicament			2
in 1999 , @entity7 and another man robbed a @entity33 store manager of the day 's takings as he attempted to deposit the cash in a night - deposit box			2
the pair used a bb gun and @entity7 was arrested two months later after witnesses gave police his car license plate number			1
between 2000 and 2004 , @entity7 filed a series of appeals which were ultimately unsuccessful			2
at that point , his bail should have been revoked and he should have been taken into custody - but he never was			0
family man : @entity7 with his wife @entity48 and their four children			2
in the years since his arrest he has built a business and a loving family life as the weeks and months passed by , @entity7 never attempted to hide : he registered a business , @entity54 , to his home address and married his wife , @entity57			1
he coached his son 's football team and volunteered at his local church			0
he even filed a post-conviction appeal that clearly stated ' @entity62 is not presently incarcerated			0
' his co-accused , @entity63 , was convicted and sentenced to 10 years			2
in filings , @entity7 's address is clearly stated as @entity66 , whereas the listing for @entity63 is the @entity0			1
no one commented on this discrepancy and @entity7 remained free for seven years after his final appeal failed in 2005			1
@entity71 , the current prosecutor for @entity72 , where the armed robbery occurred , is baffled at the error			1
somebody messed up big time , ' he told @entity78			0
as to whether @entity7 deserves to be free , he said , ' the jury heard the evidence , the judge upheld the sentence , ' he says			2
' as unfair as it may seem to he and his family , he 's got 13 years he owes the state			1
i do n't think there 's much more to say than that			0
' model citizen : after his scrape with the law , @entity7 became a master carpenter , married , and built his family a home from the ground up @entity7 's father , @entity95 , said that his son went through a rebellious phase as a young man , but has completely redeemed himself			1
he had no prior convictions at the time of the crime , and held a full - time job at @entity103			2
' if the point of incarceration is rehabilitation , the job 's already done , ' he told the @entity27			0
@entity7 's attorney @entity108 has filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the warden of @entity114 facility where @entity7 is being held , challenging the state 's right to hold @entity7			2
it argues that forcing @entity7 to serve his sentence 13 years after it was given is a violation of due process , and that taking him away from his family , work and home constitutes cruel and unusual punishment			1
' petitioner was left alone by the @entity126 for 13 years and led to believe that the state had given up on execution of the judgment			1
to require this man to now begin serving a sentence in 2013 that should have been completed in 2013 is in essence to double his sentence , ' reads the petition			0
if the petition is rejected , @entity108 plans to appeal			0
@entity134 , professor at the @entity135 , said that if all else fails , @entity7 's only other recourse would be clemency			0
' say , " hey , governor , can you pardon him or commute his sentence in light of this error on the part of the state ? this person has taken advantage of this great chance , has kept his nose clean and become a great citizen			0
after all , you have budgetary problems			0
what good is it going to do to stick this family man inside and pay for his room and board ? " ' abrupt end : @entity7 and his wife @entity48 , a hotel manager , who way away on business at the time of his arrest however , governor @entity159 has only granted one prisoner clemency since he took office in 2009			1
by contrast , the governor of @entity163 has granted 900 during the same period			0
if @entity7 is forced to serve out his original sentence , he will be 50 by the time he is released			1
his business will have failed , his children will be grown up , and his wife will have had to raise them by herself			1
the victim of his crime contacted the @entity27 after reading about @entity7 's plight			1
known only as @entity172 , he says he does n't believe @entity7 should go to jail			2
' [ the state ] were supposed to make sure he went to jail , ' he said			0
' [ @entity7 ] screwed up and he was supposed to pay for it			0
who 's paying for that ? does he have to pay for that again ? does n't seem right			0
' @entity7 says he feels guilty for the crime he committed , but believes his time would be better spent being a productive member of the community			1
' yes , i feel responsible			0
i could have stopped it , ' @entity7 says of the robbery			2
' a year or two in jail , yeah , i would have done that			0
i knew that i was there			0
i knew that something could have been done , but i ran			0
but 13 years for that ? there are guys in here on attempted murder ; they 've been here for ten years , for taking a life			1
' the court has issued an order for @entity126 â€™s attorney general to respond to @entity108 's petition by april 15			0
@entity108 has started a online petition on behalf of @entity7 to lobby attorney general of the @entity126 and @entity207 judge @entity206 to release him from prison .			1

@entity8 ' @entity7 was sentenced to 13 years prison in 2000 for armed robbery
he got bail and appealed the sentence unsuccessfully several times
he should have been *re-arrested* and jailed following his last failed appeal but he never was
over the last 13 years @entity7 *reformed* , becoming a master carpenter , business owner , *husband* , and father of four
he was arrested in front of children at home after the @entity0 went to release him from prison and realized he was n't there
now the state wants him to serve the original sentence , meaning he *'ll* be 50 and his children grown by the time he is released
the victim of his crime says he does n't want @entity21 to be locked up
he is now nine months into his sentence
