by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 11:29 est , 2 january 2013 shivering and scared , these helpless puppies were dumped by a busy main road after their owner apparently failed to sell them as @entity8 presents			1
the five , 12 - week - old @entity10 cross puppies were found outside the @entity12 's centre in @entity13 , @entity14 , on @entity15			1
they had been left without any food or water and their coats were filthy			1
recovering : these puppies were found abandoned outside the @entity12 's centre in @entity13 , @entity14 , on @entity15 , after their owner apparently failed to sell them for @entity8 presents staff at the rescue centre fear they were bred purely for @entity8 presents , but did not sell in time			1
centre manager @entity27 said : ' we found the puppies in a small plastic box by our gate , so they were clearly dumped deliberately			1
' given the timing we 're worried they were bred as @entity8 presents by someone looking to make a quick buck , but when they failed to sell they were disposed of			0
' dumping animals without food or water near a busy main road could have disastrous consequences , but thankfully we found these pups quickly , and they ’re now recovering from their ordeal			2
' as they were discovered just hours before the @entity48 , @entity46 staff decided to name them midnight , @entity53 , @entity50 in recognition of that night 's celebrations			1
and they wasted no time getting them into the warmth , giving them food , drink and a much - needed wash			2
cared for at last : as they were discovered just hours before the @entity48 , @entity46 staff decided to name them midnight ( pictured ) , @entity53 , @entity63 in recognition of that night 's celebrations having been trapped in the box , the puppies were very dirty , smelly , and desperate to escape			1
the festive period always has an impact on @entity46 , and between 24 december and 1 january the charity ’s three centres received 96 dogs and 52 cats			2
they included 11 cats and 36 dogs at @entity75 , half of which were strays			2
mrs @entity27 said : ' many of these strays are genuinely lost , but others are cruelly dumped over @entity8			0
' we pick up the pieces when people buy pets as presents			0
by march , the tiny puppies and kittens given as @entity8 presents are becoming more of a handful , they 've lost their initial charm and are then given up			0
' when it comes to gifts , please stick to toys or chocolates but not animals , as these puppies ’ heart - breaking story can testify			0
' a @entity46 staff member with @entity53 : the five puppies will need to stay at the centre for at least seven days before they can be rehomed like all strays , the five puppies will need to stay at @entity75 for at least seven days before they can be rehomed			1
mrs @entity27 said : ' they ’re all lively , fun - loving pups who will make fantastic additions to good homes			0
' fizz is a confident girl who loves a fuss , and @entity53 is her bold brother			2
' chimes is the most sensitive , while @entity110 is the shy one , and follows his affectionate brother midnight everywhere			0
' they may not have had the best start in life , but @entity46 will make sure 2013 sees a change in their fortunes			0
' if you are interested in rehoming one of the five puppies , or any other dog or cat from @entity75 , please contact 01784 494443 or bow.rehomers@battersea.org.uk .			0
