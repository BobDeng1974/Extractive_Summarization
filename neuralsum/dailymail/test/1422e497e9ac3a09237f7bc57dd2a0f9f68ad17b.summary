two @entity1 council candidates have been taken to school by a teacher who covered their sloppy election leaflet in corrections - but they claim it is a dirty tricks campaign			1
@entity7 , 54 , who specialises in teaching foreign - born children @entity9 , has embarrassed husband and wife team @entity10 and @entity14 over their spelling , punctuation and grammar			1
in one section mr @entity10 and ms @entity14 promise that @entity1 will ' take back control of our boarders ' - so the teacher wrote in red : ' i think you mean borders , not residents of a school or guest house '			1
one handwritten note about the leaflet 's opening paragraph says : ' this ' sentence ' is long and obscure			2
it needs some punctuation if it is to make sense '			2
the @entity1 candidates , from @entity55 , @entity56 , defected to @entity58 's party two weeks ago and hope to be re-elected in may , having left the @entity59 to improve their chances			1
expert : @entity7 , 54 , who specialises in teaching foreign - born children @entity9 , took her red pen to the leaflet and sent it to her children mr @entity10 today said his former party have ' hacked ' his emails for information to create a slapdash leaflet to scupper their election hopes , and has called in police			1
however , a party source has suggested the leaflet is genuine			2
he said : ' they had to rewrite everything and it looks like they did n't have time to spell check it			2
' mrs @entity7 , a specialist teacher with 32 years ' experience , told @entity81 she enjoyed a ' happy two minutes ' correcting their work			0
using a red pen she highlighted the incorrect use of words , lack of apostrophes , flabby language , poor spellings and use of @entity91			0
their error - strewn @entity1 leaflet has been shared thousands of times online			1
mrs @entity7 said : ' i marked it during a happy two minutes last night			0
i had heard about the leaflet from friends and my husband brought home a copy and straight away i told him i was eager to take a red pen to it			0
' the part about borders - or boarders - really made me laugh			2
i took a picture of my work and my children , @entity109 and @entity110 , were very amused by it			0
they posted it to their friends , and it took off			0
' i teach children who speak @entity9 as an additional language and advise other teachers about how to help them			1
there is no shame in having difficulties with spelling , punctuation and grammar			1
some of my nearest and dearest have a few issues at times , and i am certainly not poking fun at dyslexia			0
' but what i am saying is that there is a problem when people do n't recognise their own shortcomings			0
' i have not met the candidates , but the leaflet suggests that if you ca n't check something like this properly , how can you run something properly if you were to be elected			1
' i am most certainly not going to vote @entity1 , absolutely not , but i will not say who i will be voting for			2
' i wo n't discuss ( @entity1 ) policies , i will just say that the children i work with are a delight , and some of them could teach mr @entity10 a thing or two about apostrophes '			1
election campaign : @entity10 and @entity14 , left and right , defected to @entity58 's party two weeks ago and hope to be re-elected in may @entity149 : this bullet point lacks the necessary apostrophe in one of more than 20 corrections lost in translation : a key section to persuade voters to back them next month also backfired changes : mrs @entity158 suggested in her red notes ' try not to keep using apostrophes for plurals ' a picture of the annotated leaflet has spread across the internet after it was posted on @entity165 by a user who said a mother of a friend had marked it after finding it on her doormat			1
the leaflet also boasted about @entity14 and @entity10 's campaigning which led to the creation of ten free parking spaces at the local @entity177 car park			1
mr. @entity10 says the @entity59 have put out the leaflet to ' stitch him up '			1
he said ' they have been hacking into my emails , the @entity59			2
they 've hacked it all and i have the police looking at it now			0
' it 's the @entity59 who are doing it all			1
they 've hacked into my emails , they 've basically got hold my stuff , they are producing it , they are sending it out , they are doing everything they can			0
' i 'm receiving about 20 , 30 phone calls before 12 o'clock today threatening to kill me			0
the police are on to all of that '			0
mr. @entity10 , 48 , who runs a plumbing and heating company , added : ' i used to be a @entity59 councillor			1
' about a month ago , i left the @entity59 to go @entity1 and obviously a lot of them do n't like it , so they are producing stuff like [ the flyer ] and putting it out and putting my name to it			1
' i spoke to the police this morning			0
they are worried about it because people are making threats to kill me and stuff			0
supportive : mrs @entity7 says she was not poking fun , adding : ' there is no shame in having difficulties with spelling , punctuation and grammar ' ' they believe the propaganda from the national parties , like the @entity224 are saying that @entity1 are racist			1
they do n't like it			0
' i was a @entity59 councillor and i 've gone to @entity1 - they do n't like that			1
these people are very vindictive			0
' i do n't know who the death threats are coming from but the police are investigating it now			0
' the @entity59 have put all that s * * * out about me			2
they 've stuck a load of stuff on my @entity240 , they hacked into that			0
' a @entity59 spokesman said this afternoon : ‘ the idea that the @entity59 had anything to do with @entity245 ’s absurd allegations is categorically untrue			2
' @entity59 take the accusation that the party was involved in illegal activity such as the hacking of emails seriously , and the local party is exploring its options			2
’ mrs @entity7 asked @entity81 to include a link to the charity @entity254 , recommended by the charity @entity255 , which her son @entity110 , 24 , volunteers for .			0
