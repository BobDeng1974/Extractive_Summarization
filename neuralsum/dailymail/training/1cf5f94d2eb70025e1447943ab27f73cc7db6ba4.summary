by dr @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 25 january 2014 updated : 18:08 est , 25 january 2014 when we read about social media in the news , it ’s rarely for a good reason			1
last week footballer - turned - pundit @entity7 was ‘ declaring war ’ on ‘ vile internet trolls ’ – those who write abusive things in order to bully others online			2
but another battle being waged on sites including @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 caught my attention last week : a campaign urging the public to come forward and ‘ swab 4margot ’			1
on the sites , enchanting images of a gorgeous red - haired toddler are emblazoned with the words : ‘ @entity28			2
’ save @entity29 : the family of 17 - month - old @entity31 , who was diagnosed with a very rare type of leukaemia last year , has started a campaign to find a donor match for her the adorable little girl in question is 17 - month - old @entity31 , who was diagnosed last october with a very rare type of leukaemia			1
in order to have a chance of a cure she needs a stem cell donor – previously called a bone marrow donor			2
no relatives are a match , so the search has had to be opened up to the world , through social media			1
actually registering as a donor is an incredibly simple process			2
on the website deletebloodcancer.org.uk , you can order an at - home mouth swab kit			2
once done and sent off , it is processed in a lab and your tissue type can be determined and placed on a register			1
although 90,000 @entity64 have now registered , only half of the 1,600 patients currently on the stem cell donor waiting list will find a match			2
for the others , sadly , there is little hope			2
support : @entity70 is just one of several celebrities , and thousands of ordinary people , who are helping spread the word about @entity29 's plight a @entity19 video of @entity29 , with a haunting soundtrack by pop star @entity78 , has now been viewed more than 55,000 times			1
it is watched 1,000 times a day			0
boosting awareness , the @entity83 ’ @entity17 campaign has been retweeted by celebrities with huge followings such as @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity70 and @entity89 , while @entity29 ’s @entity18 page has more than 8,000 likes			1
in the first two weeks of the campaign , 12,000 people requested a swab kit from @entity95 – a huge number in that timeframe			1
and even if a match for @entity29 is n’t found , then many others like her could benefit			1
this sort of campaign represents a sea change in the world of health			1
of course , finding a donor in such circumstances , even in the digital age , is a herculean task , but less than a decade ago the outlook for desperately sick babies such as @entity29 , or adults in need of similar treatment , was far bleaker			1
social media is a massive boon in what is essentially a numbers game – the more people who register as donors , the more chance those on transplant waiting lists who are perilously ill will be helped			1
it is all about improving the statistics , and the only way to do that is to tell more and more people			0
some 20 years ago i signed up as a stem cell donor in response to the @entity133			0
@entity134 was a young woman with leukaemia who spoke at more than 150 events across @entity64 to raise awareness of her plight			1
for leukaemia patients , chemotherapy and radiotherapy are very effective in getting rid of cancer in the blood			1
but the aggressive treatment attacks all cells that divide rapidly ( as cancer cells do ) and destroys healthy bone marrow – the soft tissues inside the bones that create red blood cells			0
for the patient to survive the process , new bone marrow – stem cells – must be put back into the bones			0
there are two ways to donate : either under general anaesthetic , when stem cells are extracted from the hip or elsewhere with a needle , or through a process that is carried out while awake			0
this involves taking medication to increase the number of stem cells			0
which type of ‘ harvesting ’ is used depends on specific details of the donor ’s and the recipient ’s @entity173 donors can remain anonymous			1
for the time , @entity134 ’s campaign was a phenomenal success story in terms of recruitment , adding at least 15,000 to the register over the few years of her campaign			1
towards the end of the campaign a donor match was found , but @entity134 was already too unwell for it to be a success , and shesadly died in 1997 , aged 34			1
most patients and their families wo n’t have the kind of tremendous strength and determination that @entity134 showed in the face of crushing illness			0
at the time , she had to persuade local newspapers and radio stations to carry her story , but with so many needy patients , it was not feasible to expect every one to be given airtime			0
this is why blogs , websites and social media represent such a revolution : they are a direct route to a wide circle of people who actually care about you and your family			1
mind you , it is quick and easy to click ‘ like ’ or retweet a campaign – most of us will have done so or at least be aware of such things			1
but it takes that bit more goodwill to take action and register to help			0
it ’s an issue experienced by @entity219 , whose mother , @entity220 , received a stem cell transplant last year following a social media campaign organised by her children			1
@entity220 was diagnosed with leukaemia just before christmas 2012			2
@entity219 says : ‘ retweets raise awareness but people have to take action , and that is the hard part			0
‘ no one in the family was a match so my sister @entity233 and i set up the # spit4mum @entity17 campaign and had unprompted retweets from celebrities like @entity237			2
‘ by january there was a 1,000 per cent rise in donor registrations			0
this type of campaigning really works			2
‘ but it took persistence and luck , and at the end of the day goodwill			0
someone – we do n’t know who – registered and saved her life			0
‘ that took a lot more than just pressing “ like ” on @entity18			0
’ @entity259 , @entity29 ’s father , explains it simply : ‘ the first day i had my head in my hands			1
@entity29 was on life support , i was feeling very sorry for myself			1
but she had strength , and that gave us strength			0
we had to do something to save our daughter			0
‘ the next day we started making our @entity19 video			0
if nothing else , we knew this would be our emotional and sanity insurance policy			0
we can look back , whatever happens , and know we searched the hardest we could			0
’ he is realistic about what this means in real terms for @entity29 , and he knows they may not find a perfect match			1
‘ however many people you reach , only a small percentage will actually click through and register as a donor			0
we have been overwhelmed by the community aspect of this , the goodwill of people and the immense support			2
‘ the problem is that even if people see the campaign , only one per cent will register as a donor			2
we all need that figure to be much higher			0
’ for now , the martinis are left to play a nervous waiting game , hoping that the next click will be the one their baby needs			0
