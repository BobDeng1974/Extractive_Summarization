world boxing champion @entity0 is in hospital in @entity2 after being stabbed in the leg on thursday during an altercation while on holiday			1
the 28 - year - old , who won the @entity8 welterweight title last month , is not believed to be in a life - threatening condition , though @entity11 police claim ‘ he lost a lot of blood ’ from multiple wounds in his left leg and also suffered defence injuries to his arm in the 6am incident			1
onlookers at the scene , close to the @entity22 resort in southern @entity2 , have described a trail of blood from an apartment at the @entity27 complex , to a second apartment where @entity0 is understood to have attempted to gain entry by smashing a patio window			1
the @entity39 star had won 32 fights as a professional before earning his shot at the @entity8 welterweight title , a journey that had more than it 's fair share of roadblocks			1
@entity0 was the mandatory challenger to the great @entity59 as far back as 2010 but instead had to bide his time			2
a switch to promoter @entity62 saw an upturn in his fortunes as he progressed from fighting in leisure centres to filling out arenas			0
victory over @entity68 two years ago manoeuvred him into position to fight then champion @entity70 but injuries to both men saw the fight postponed three times and eventually cancelled			0
instead , he faced the undefeated @entity42 , outpointing the champion to become the sixth @entity75 to hold a world title in the division and the first since @entity80 's brief stint in 2006			1
that victory should catapult him into the realm of mega-fights with a domestic dust - up with bitter @entity85 rival @entity46 on the cards for next year			2
@entity87 @entity88 has been told by a local source that concerned residents then contacted security and @entity0 was taken by ambulance to @entity94 hospital in @entity95			2
@entity0 is understood to have been on a night out in @entity22 with his heavily pregnant partner , @entity96 , who left early and was not present when the altercation occurred			1
@entity0 is said to have met up with mutual friends after parting company with his girlfriend , before heading back to @entity27 in the early hours			2
it is believed he had spent time with his attacker			2
a @entity11 police spokesman said : ‘ this morning a 28 - year - old @entity85 man was stabbed in the left leg and is hospitalised			1
he lost a lot of blood			2
there are no arrests at this time			0
’ the @entity39 fighter ’s promoter @entity62 , who had been in talks to make a blockbuster showdown with @entity46 at @entity116 next may , was on thursday night planning to fly to @entity2 to check on @entity0 ’s condition			1
@entity62 told @entity88 : ‘ we are all worried about what has happened and we have not been able to speak to @entity0			0
i am told he is stable			0
’ @entity0 ’s next fight , scheduled for december 6 in @entity39 , is now a major doubt			1
it is the second time @entity0 has been stabbed , having also been attacked in his hometown of @entity39 in 2007			1
he was leaving the @entity125 , in @entity126 , when he was stabbed in the side and buttocks			0
@entity0 returned to fight six months later and has since amassed a perfect record of 33 fights and 33 wins			0
he clinched the @entity8 world welterweight title 20 days ago with a points victory over 26 - year - old @entity134 @entity42 in @entity135			1
@entity0 is being treated at @entity136 and police remain at scene of both the scene of the attack pictures of blood splattered on the concrete which are said to be connected to the stabbing of @entity0 flying the flag : @entity0 is an attractive opponent for @entity46 having upset the odds to beat @entity42 in @entity27 in training : @entity85 boxer brook , pictured in 2010 , enjoys a run in his hometown of @entity39 rising : @entity0 is unbeaten in 33 fights			1
he was scheduled to return to the ring in december , but that 's in doubt @entity62 failed with a previous £ 3million offer to @entity46 to fight @entity0 , but the @entity39 fighter has become a far more attractive opponent to @entity46 since beating @entity42			1
@entity62 had written in his @entity159 column this week that negotiations could be concluded within a month			0
' talks are ongoing over a fight between @entity0 and @entity46			0
it is going well because i think everyone realises it makes sense , ' wrote @entity62			0
' @entity46 obviously wants a fight with @entity169 , as does everyone in the division , but he knows that while that fight might never happen , even if it did he would make more money fighting @entity0			0
‘ everything so far has been very straightforward and i am in talks with @entity116 over a may date			0
they want us back there as soon as possible after the success of @entity181 – i have no doubt in my mind that we would fill that stadium again			0
i hope to have this tied up in the next month or so			0
