the advocacy group @entity0 has responded to the mass shooting in @entity2 in their own fashion – by saying that gun control supporters ‘ have the blood of little children on their hands			1
’ the organization ’s executive director , @entity8 , said in a statement immediately following the horrific december 14 shootings in @entity12 , that ‘ blood is on the hands of members of @entity16 and the @entity2 legislators who voted to ban guns from all schools in @entity2			1
’ the pro-gun lobbyist said today on @entity22 ’s ‘ hardball ’ claimed that if the teachers at @entity25 had guns , the whole tragedy could be prevented			1
’ and speaking today on ‘ hardball with @entity41 , ’ @entity8 said : ‘ nothing is 100 percent , but if teachers , janitors , and principals were able to defend themselves with guns , ’ the children of @entity12 ‘ might have had a chance			1
’ he stated : ‘ it would serve you better than sitting like fish in a barrel			0
’ also in his ‘ @entity40 ’ interview , @entity8 stated that it was necessary to be ‘ prepared ’ and ‘ control the government			1
’ however , @entity56 , a former special agent of the @entity57 said on @entity22 that @entity8 ’s argument crumbled at first blush			1
‘ law enforcement is here as a force of good and we ’re the good guys , ’ he said			0
the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) , the largest pro-gun advocacy group in the nation , however , has remained conspicuously quiet			0
following the shooting , the @entity63 deactivated its @entity67 page , then issuing a very minimal page where commenting is disabled			1
driving point home : speaking today on ' @entity40 , ' @entity8 said that the shooting might have been prevented if the teachers had guns meanwhile , @entity75 gun - rights advocates on monday joined the growing number of lawmakers in their party who have started to call for limits on assault weapons , a sign that the @entity2 school massacre could be the ' tipping point ' to revive the gun control debate in @entity86			1
senator @entity90 of @entity91 and @entity91 senator @entity92 , both @entity87 who have earned top marks from the powerful @entity63 , said they would now be open to more regulation of military - style rifles like the one used to kill 20 young children and six adults on friday			1
and @entity98 minority leader @entity97 said she would support legislation banning assault weapons after previously throwing cold water on the idea			0
' the voices of reason can not be silent , ' she said on the @entity98 floor late on monday			0
'' through administrative and legislative action , we must limit the proliferation of weapons and ammunition that have no other purpose than to kill citizens			0
' @entity114 lawmakers have not approved a major new federal gun law since 1994 , and a ban on certain semi-automatic rifles known as assault weapons expired in 2004			1
demanding change : @entity121 , speaking at a vigil last night in @entity12 , said that there must be harsher gun control laws enforced memorial : candles are lit among mementos at a memorial for victims of the mass shooting at @entity129 , on december 17 , 2012 in @entity12 , @entity2 senator @entity130 , a @entity132 @entity131 who authored the previous ban , pledged to introduce legislation early next year to ban the weapons			1
gunman @entity136 shot and killed 26 people , including his mother , before killing himself previous attempts at toughening @entity114 gun laws have failed amid opposition from the @entity63 and other gun - lobby groups - even after mass shootings across the country			1
but the shift by moderate @entity87 showed that the weapons lobby could face a tougher fight this time to ward off calls for more regulation			0
however , with @entity16 and president @entity121 busy trying to resolve the ' fiscal cliff ' of tax and spending deadlines , even @entity87 acknowledge that any review of gun laws would not take place until 2013			2
a hunter and member of the @entity63 , @entity90 said the availability of such high - powered weapons does not make sense , and that he knew of no hunter who went out with assault rifles or clips with 30 rounds of ammunition			0
' this awful massacre of our youngest children has changed us , and everything should be on the table , ' said @entity90 , who once ran a campaign ad in which he shot environmental legislation with a rifle			2
solemn : people light candles at a makeshift memorial in @entity12 , @entity2 monday night ' there 's got to be a way to put reasonable restrictions , particularly as we look at assault weapons , as we look at these fast clips of ammunition , ' @entity92 , whose state is home to the @entity63 , told the @entity186			0
@entity187 , a @entity75 @entity114 representative from @entity188 , also shifted position			0
' i have been largely silent on the issue of gun violence over the past six years , and i am now as sorry for that as i am for what happened to the families who lost so much in this most recent , but sadly not isolated , tragedy , ' he said in a statement			2
there has been little word on assault weapons from republicans , who are traditionally strong gun rights advocates , even in the wake of the @entity12 deaths			2
@entity188 's @entity205 , the @entity201 leader in the @entity206 , offered words of comfort , but did not mention weapons when he spoke on monday in the @entity206 chamber , where a parade of @entity75 senators called for greater gun control			1
representatives for the @entity63 did not respond to a request for comment			0
the lobby group has no statement on the school shooting on its website			2
it has not posted any comments on social media since friday			0
tragic : the funeral for @entity129 , 6 , happened today @entity121 called on sunday for the country to change its approach to violence , although he did not use the word ' gun			1
' the @entity98 said on monday gun control is part but not the entire answer to address the violence in the @entity114			1
but the tide of national emotion over the deaths of so many children could make a difference this time			2
' one of great strengths of the @entity63 has been its bipartisanship , ' said @entity242 , a political scientist at @entity243 in @entity244 , @entity91			0
' now it 's almost all @entity201 and it will be harder for the @entity63 to deal with a bunch of united and angry @entity87			0
' police said 20 - year - old @entity136 was armed with hundreds of bullets in high - capacity magazines of about 30 rounds each for the @entity253 rifle with which he mowed down the children and staff			2
