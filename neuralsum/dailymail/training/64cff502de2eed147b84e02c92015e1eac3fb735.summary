one month after his owner died and willed him to be killed and buried with her , @entity13 the @entity20 shepherd had a new home where he could live out the rest of his life in peace			2
that life wound up being very short			0

@entity13 was rescued after animal lovers rallied to his defense and got a stay of execution for him early this month			1
when his owner , @entity52 , died on november 25 , she said that he should be either sent to the @entity9 shelter or put down , cremated and his ashes mixed with hers			2
ms @entity52 's attorney , @entity55 , said ms @entity52 did n't have enough money to send her pet to @entity1 - so the only option was to euthanize him			2
sad : @entity13 arrived at @entity9 in southern @entity1 in december after staff from the shelter drove him more than 1,700 miles from @entity22 , @entity4 - outside @entity45 , @entity46			1
over this past weekend , her was diagnosed with an aggressive lung cancer the @entity9 family suffered a very sad and entirely unexpected loss over the weekend			2
on sunday morning , we had to say goodbye to the magnificent @entity20 shepherd , @entity13 , who captured our hearts over the holidays			2
@entity13 was the object of international attention and affection in the weeks leading up to @entity71 , when it came to light that the will of his recently deceased owner contained a discretionary clause that placed his life at risk			0
the will entrusted the late owner ’s close friend to make the decision whether @entity13 should come to @entity9 to live out his days or be killed and his ashes interred with his lifelong human friend			1
following international coverage and arrangements with the deceased ’s attorney and friend , @entity13 made a snowy cross-country car trip over @entity71 with our trainer @entity90			0
on sunday morning @entity13 ’s caregiver noticed that his abdomen was distended and he was breathing rapidly , so he was brought to the @entity9 clinic for an emergency checkup			1
tests revealed fluid in his abdomen and also surrounding his heart			0
most critically , @entity99 revealed nodules in his lungs			0
our medical director diagnosed @entity13 with a very fast - growing cancer and there was very little likelihood he would have lasted more than a very stressful day or so			1
reluctantly , @entity13 ’s caregiving team made the decision that euthanasia was the right option			0
this was a very difficult choice , as it is with any animal in our care , but we approached the decision from the perspective of what was the kindest course of action for @entity13			0
it is our custom to bury sanctuary animals who have crossed the @entity124 at @entity125 , the permanent resting place located in @entity127			0
however , in this case we felt the right thing to do was to fulfill @entity13 ’s owner ’s last wishes			0
therefore , we are cremating @entity13 and sending his ashes to @entity4 so he can be buried with his owner , who passed away in november			1
@entity13 was a great dog who made many friends and was quickly becoming one of the most popular dogs at the @entity139			0
our staff had grown to love him as the sweet and wonderful dog he was , and every one of us who knew him is devastated by this turn of events			0
@entity13 will be greatly missed			0
source : @entity146 news of @entity13 's fate was widely reported and sparked a # @entity150 campaign on social media			0
following outrage from the community , @entity152 stepped in and said the shelter would take @entity13 and have him transported to @entity1			1
mr @entity55 now claims it was never his intention to have the dog put down			0
' it was this lack of information and the unfounded social media backlash about @entity21 , myself , and the provisions in her will about her pets , that caused the delay in resolving @entity13 ’s future , ' he said , according to a blog post from @entity9			1
@entity13 was given a hero 's welcome when he arrived to the @entity1 pet sanctuary but the happy new homecoming would soon turn tragic			1

@entity21 of @entity22 , @entity4 *stipulated* in her will that @entity13 either go to @entity9 or die along with her
