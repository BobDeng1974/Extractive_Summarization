while those throngs are a boon to @entity3 's tottering tourism industry , they also scatter a prehistoric landscape with unwanted litter and strain a delicate ecosystem			1
' it used to be more solitary and inhospitable , ' recalled @entity41 , a 59 - year - old guide who has been taking people up the mountain for more than a decade			1
' i still love it , but there are too many people , ' said @entity41 , his calves aching after he led two groups up and down @entity29 with the local @entity53 tour agency			2
' it 's chaotic sometimes			2
' between 3,000 and 4,000 people are climbing each year , up from hundreds a few years ago			2
that creates queues during peak times over @entity59 and @entity60 , and sometimes leaves the few sheltered coves at the top crammed with tents			2
helicopters bring wealthy foreign tourists , especially from @entity66 , to the summit			2
' it 's an exotic , faraway destination so it 's both very costly and very attractive , ' said retired @entity66 diplomat @entity69 , 68 , who like other compatriots , had to pass a physical test before leaving @entity66 for @entity29			0
in @entity9 language , the flat - topped mountains across southeastern @entity3 are known as ' tepuis , ' which means ' houses of the gods			1
' standing majestically next to @entity29 is @entity77 , another tepui , infamous among the @entity31 for ancestors who jumped off and committed suicide there			0

in @entity115 author @entity98 's 1912 classic ' @entity6 , ' dinosaurs attack a group of explorers amid the rocks and swamps of that fantasy landscape			1
the novel was made into a film in 1960 produced by @entity125 starring @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity130 among others			0
and it was adapted again in 2001 starring @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
today 's travelers can see black frogs , dragonflies and tarantulas that are unique to @entity29 , plus a range of endemic plants clinging to cracks and crevasses			0
not surprisingly , it is also an ornithologist 's paradise			0
thousands of tourists travel to the the cliffs of @entity17 to picture themselves next to the enchanting structures that shaped @entity6 film some @entity29 lovers want the government , tour operators and local @entity158 leaders to convene and make rules to limit the numbers of tourists the mountain is becoming more and more popular , which in turn brings its own host of problems , such as littering the 1960 version of the classic tale of a lost world starred @entity127 , @entity130 and @entity168 some @entity29 lovers want the government , tour operators and local @entity158 leaders to convene and make rules to limit the numbers who can roam the top each day to , say , a few dozen			1

@entity183 , 42 , a @entity3 and children 's book illustrator who has been living away from her homeland most of her adult life , said she had been hearing about @entity29 since her teenage years and finally climbed it this year			1
