by @entity0 for @entity1 a man who used to live off takeaways and frequented his local pub on a daily basis has totally transformed his life and his physique by taking up body building			1
as the oldest surviving male in his family , having lost many relatives to cancer , @entity13 , 48 , from @entity14 , was already aware of his health and became determined to make a change as he approached his 40th birthday			1
the father - of - three now works out every day and has even started a new career as a personal trainer			1
‘ as cancer surrounds my family , i decided at 40 years old to change my lifestyle completely			1
‘ i stopped going to the pub every night and instead starting going back to the gym , cutting down on my alcohol intake			0
‘ it was hard at first but i soon got the bug for it and began changing my life and well being			2
’ until he was 40 , @entity13 worked in the construction industry , going to the pub every day as well as living off fast food in the form of takeaways – eating at chip shops and the local @entity43 every week			1
although never overweight , @entity13 was unfit , unhealthy and un-toned			2
@entity44 lover @entity13 used to visit the pub most days and lived off a diet of chips and takeaways he used to snack on anything sweet , such as chocolate , sweets and crisps , as well as drinking pints of @entity44 daily			1
@entity13 initially began just to workout , making few changes to his diet , but soon realised he needed to make drastic changes to his food intake to see real improvements in his well being			1
having lost many family members to cancer , @entity13 was becoming increasingly aware of his health as he approached 40 ‘ i trained to do a triathlon for over 18 months but this made me feel too slim and cut my muscles away , so i changed my plan			1
after spending the next three years working abroad and trying to go the gym daily i started to see muscle growth and developments			0
‘ i soon realised that food is as important if not more important than anything you do in the @entity75 , as no great body has been achieved without a healthy lifestyle			2
’ since he has started his new regime @entity13 has cut out all bread , and swapped any white carbs for brown , choosing a wholemeal alternative when possible and exchanging potatoes for sweet potatoes			2
an average day now might start with a breakfast of eggs and porridge followed by chicken salad for lunch and fish with sweet potatoes and vegetables for dinner			0
he has ditched the @entity44 and now makes a juice mix in the morning that he drinks over the course of the day which includes celery , cucumber , beetroot , rhubarb , apple , pear , banana , pineapple , avocado , protein powder , peanut butter and honey			0
‘ after changing the way i thought about food and supplements my body began to change slowly but surely			1
after three years of consistent training and good eating i ’m now a different man with a totally different body , my whole body skin and face look healthier younger and fitter			2
‘ my whole life has changed for the better , i can deal with problems , i ’m more positive , stronger and very much contented with where i am now			0
’ as well as transforming how he feels , @entity13 has gained a new career through his new found love of exercise			1
as well as totally changing his body and health , @entity13 has begun a new career as a personal trainer ‘ i currently work as a full time personal trainer with 15 - 20 regular clients and two separate classes			1
‘ i have a lot of clients who are over 40 and i have inspired them to get into great shape also			0
‘ the gym is now a part of my life i could not do without , it has helped me get rid of depression and anxiety			0
i ’ve passed this on to my clients , and they ca n’t believe the difference			0
‘ i also work with the elderly and over 80 ’s and seeing these people made me realise how important it is to keep your body flexible and mobile			0
‘ we are still very capable of performing and keeping a body in great shape no matter how old we are , my fitness and capabilities have gone from strength to strength			2
‘ i believe that everyone over 40 should try and change their lifestyle to include the gym and a healthy lifestyle , giving them a better quality and longer life expectancy			0
’ @entity13 is not alone in discovering fitness later in life			0
a survey commissioned by sports nutrition supplier @entity163 of over 2,000 people has shown that @entity166 ( middle aged men in lycra ) are the fastest growing age group to have taken up bodybuilding over the past 12 months , with them representing more than one in ten of the nation 's bodybuilders .			0
