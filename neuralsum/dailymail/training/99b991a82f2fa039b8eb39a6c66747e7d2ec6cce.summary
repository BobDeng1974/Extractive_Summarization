by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:38 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 04:50 est , 28 july 2013 the glorious spell of sunshine @entity4 has been basking in for the last few weeks has come to an abrupt end this weekend			2
the @entity7 's warning for heavy downpours and thunderstorms today became a grim reality for spectators at @entity13 's @entity12			1
after weeks of sun , the audience at @entity15 dove for cover and panic bought anoraks to protect themselves from the heavy showers			2
weather experts have warned some regions may be hit by localised flooding from this evening into sunday as thousands of holidaymakers prepare to set off for their summer break			1
the crowd at the @entity12 came prepared for the turn in the weather downpour : spectators did not let the bad weather spoil the event @entity46 spell : crowds at the @entity12 in @entity13 sit through the wet weather , hoping the showers will pass keeping dry : festival goers at @entity51 in @entity52 had a soggy experience visitors to @entity55 enjoy the last of the heatwave before the predicted storms this weekend rain and thunderstorms have been predicted for this weekend , although many people were still enjoying the warm weather at @entity55 downpour : heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected for parts of the country today , the @entity7 has warned , emulating these showers in @entity68 earlier this week the @entity7 has issued a ' yellow ' warning of rain following concerns that heavy showers and thunderstorms expected over @entity74 today could move north to affect south - east @entity75 and @entity76			1
the thundery weather is then expected to move north to cover large parts of @entity75 on sunday , with as much as 30mm of rain falling in an hour in @entity83 areas , forecasters have warned			1
@entity84 , forecaster at @entity85 , the weather division of the @entity86 , said there was ' every chance ' of flash flooding in areas affected by the torrential rain			0
' there 's a pool of warm air moving up from the continent which should arrive in the south east of @entity75 by ( the ) afternoon , ' he said			1
' that will bring heavy and thundery rain across much of south - east @entity75 , before it moves in a north west direction across the @entity99 , parts of east @entity101 and south - west @entity75			1
' this rain will keep pushing north on sunday into northern @entity75 and @entity103			2
then , moving in from the west , further showers and outbreaks of rain with the risk of thunder will affect south - west @entity75 and @entity101			1
' crowds gather in the last of the @entity4 heatwave at the 25th international @entity112 @entity114 @entity113 perform at the 25th international @entity112 flooding : parts of the country were hit with flash flooding earlier this week as torrential rain fell on dry ground the @entity83 will bear the brunt of the weekend 's rain with as much as 30mm expected to fall within an hour , and 50mm within three hours in some places , according to the @entity7			1
this compares with an average rainfall of around 80mm for the whole month of july , @entity85 said			0
in its weather warning , the @entity7 said : ' thunderstorms and areas of heavy , thundery rain are expected to move north from @entity74 during the course of saturday afternoon and evening			1
' the public should be aware of the risk of localised disruption to travel , due to surface water flooding and lightning strikes			0
' armageddon : the hot weather has put paid to slugs temperatures will remain warm for most of the country , however , with highs between @entity141 to @entity142 for much of @entity75 today , mr @entity84 said			2
meanwhile , as gardeners up and down the country have watched in dismay as the heatwave turned their lawns a dusty brown , every cloudless sky has a silver lining : the continued dry weather has put paid to two of the most common garden pests – slugs and snails			1
last summer ’s washout led to increased numbers of slugs , including an outbreak of the @entity161 ‘ super ’ slug , which can grow to more than 4in in length and carry parasites			1
hot : beachgoers pictured on the beach in @entity168 this week have basked in two weeks of sunny weather , but it 's about to come to an end but the longest spell of warm weather since 2006 has so far put paid to fears of a similar invasion this year			0
another summer nuisance , the mosquito , has also fared badly			0
they lay their eggs in water , as the larvae need it to survive , but the dry weather has evaporated breeding pools , dramatically reducing numbers			0
but weeks of uninterrupted blue skies and soaring temperatures , are about to come to a very wet end , with forecasters predicting up to two inches of rain could fall in the south - east in just three hours today , as violent thunderstorms sweep across the country			2
@entity7 forecaster @entity193 , said : ‘ it ’s going to be very wet over the weekend for some and we have a warning out for today , as the @entity83 and @entity198 receive a band of thunderstorms and heavy rain that is moving northwards from @entity74			1
’ change : july 's glorious hot spell , seen being enjoyed here by a woman in a lavender field in @entity206 , @entity207 , is to end with temperatures dropping dramatic : a lightning bolt strikes the @entity211 in @entity212 during one of the biggest storms ever to hit @entity212 but the downpours are not bad news for everyone			0
they will be welcomed by those whose gardens are in need of water , and could bring an added boost for summer berries			0
more drought - resistant plants , such as blackberries , have been helped by the hot spell , but the forecast rains will help swell the berries for a bumper late - summer crop , according to @entity232 from the @entity233			0
flash floods : cars were completely submerged following flash flooding in @entity237 , @entity238 , this week there is also potential for a really good apple and plum harvest , he said			0
mr @entity232 , who highlighted the impact of the heat on slug numbers , explained : ‘ much of @entity4 ’s nature is booming after the warm spell , and many of those doing best are species humans are particularly fond of			0
as for those doing badly , they are creatures that are mostly seen as unpopular such as slugs , snails and biting flies			0
‘ and with an abundance of insects , there are rich pickings for a lot of our birds who are enjoying these conditions , with species such as swallows and housemartins doing particularly well			0
’ the july heatwave saw the longest spell of hot weather to affect the whole of @entity4 for seven years , with temperatures exceeding @entity274 ( 82f ) somewhere in the @entity4 for 19 consecutive days			2
the warmest day since july 2006 was recorded last monday at @entity275 and @entity276 , in west @entity13 , when the mercury reached @entity278 ( 92f ) the @entity7 ’s @entity279 said : ‘ the best of the summer weather is over for now , and it looks like the next few days will be unsettled , with thundery storms moving up from the @entity83 over the weekend			1
‘ temperatures will stay above average , but it will remain quite humid , with the risk of some wet weather in much of the country			0
