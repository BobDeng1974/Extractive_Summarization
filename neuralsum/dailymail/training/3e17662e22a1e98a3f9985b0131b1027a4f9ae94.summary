by @entity1 reporter published : 16:00 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 22:27 est , 21 july 2013 an @entity3 mother is furious after her two - year - old son 's former daycare center posted a public warning with his picture online accusing him of ' biting '			1
after kicking little @entity10 out of @entity11 in @entity12 for allegedly biting a child , co-owner @entity9 uploaded an image of the toddler to @entity16 with a severe warning : ' beware of this kid , he bites '			1
' i was sick as any parent would be if they saw their child on the internet , ' @entity10 's distressed mother @entity19 told @entity27 ’s @entity26 program , which investigated complaints against the family - run center			2
devastated : @entity3 's @entity19 , left , was horrified after seeing a @entity16 post warning people her two - year - old son @entity10 was a ' biter ' the online feud began when @entity10 ' five - year - old son , who also attended the center , started complaining he was n't getting enough food			1
@entity10 said she contacted @entity40 , telling her the daily fee should cover all meals			0
soon after , both boys were kicked out			0
' she [ @entity40 ] stated that my two - year - old had bit another child , ' @entity10 told @entity27			0
@entity10 , disappointed after initially believing the center was ' perfect ' for her boys , posted an online listing warning parents to stay away from @entity53			1
that 's when @entity40 retaliated , posting @entity10 ’s photo online and warning other daycare operators that he was a ' biter '			1
but @entity40 took the matter even further by sending @entity10 an aggressive text message : ' your kid is a dog and he keeps biting '			2
family - owned : mother and daughter @entity66 owners @entity64 , left , and @entity9 , right , have been accused of bullying parents this was the @entity12 , @entity3 , home @entity64 and @entity9 used to operate @entity66 daycare center while the state of @entity3 has reportedly not received any formal complaints against the business owners , @entity27 found several parents have had run - ins with them			1
@entity78 claimed her two sons were also kicked out of @entity66 without warning because the @entity81 claimed her 19 - month - old son put another child in a chokehold			1
when @entity40 thought that @entity86 had posted a complaint online , the daycare owner emailed her saying : ' i hope you die and your kid			1
' ' to watch people ’s children and you tell somebody ’s mother you hope them and their child die , ' @entity86 told @entity27			0
i do n’t know about that			0
' dateline also alleged the @entity81 should have applied for a childcare license because they had been caring for at least 10 children at any one time			0
the center does n't need a license if they look after a maximum of four children at a time			2
@entity27 spoke to @entity108 , a mother who removed her children from @entity66 after seeing more than a dozen kids at the center			2
