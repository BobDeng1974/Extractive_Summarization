at first glance it looks like a blur of colour , but this incredible image actually shows all 250,000 rivers running through @entity6			1
not only that , it also reveal which direction they run in			2
researchers created the incredible maps from data created by the @entity14			1
scroll down for an interactive version of the map @entity18 designer @entity17 created the amazing map using data created by the @entity14 of all 250,000 rivers running through @entity6			1
the longest river on the map is the @entity22 at 4088 kilometres			2
but the biggest in terms of water volume is the @entity26 , which is deeper			0
at 1114 kilometres , the @entity27 is the longest un-dammed river in the @entity6			1
it was created by @entity18 designer @entity17 of data - visualisation firm @entity29			0
he used @entity31 platform and the @entity32 , which is made available online by the @entity14 , to create the map			1
' there are 18 distinct colours around the compass , ' says @entity17 , who also works for @entity37			1
@entity39 , for example , represents a river that runs north - south or south - north			1
@entity37 is a a cloud based mapping , analysis and visualization engine that lets users build spatial applications for both mobile and the web , and it often used on property websites and new sites to create maps			0
recently , the firm made its technology available for free			0
' we realized that charging for map views was actually penalizing you for creating interesting maps , ' said @entity17			0
' we no longer want you to have to worry about unexpected traffic or what happens when the maps on your account go viral			0
