surveillance cameras captured the moment every door at a maximum - security jail wing in @entity4 swung open and released a flock of violent criminals , who ganged up and attacked another inmate with vicious homemade knives			1
the inmate was forced to jump over a railing and fall one story to escape his assailants , who are believed to be members of a rival gang in the @entity16 neighborhood of @entity17			1
the @entity18 says it still does n't know why the security system unlocked and opened every door in the maximum - security wing of the @entity22 on june 14			1
however , two inmates immediately crept out of their cells - seemingly moving with purpose - as soon as the doors slid open			1
the men were allegedly armed with homemade prison shivs the @entity38 reports that this has led some to speculate that the prisoners knew that their doors would open and that they were waiting to be let out to execute their attack			1
the @entity38 obtained a copy of the june 14 surveillance video			0
it shows an attack on @entity34 , believed to be a leader of the @entity48 gang that deals drugs in a @entity17 public housing project , by three rival gang members - all of whom were allegedly armed with shivs - crude prison knives			1
@entity34 jumped over a railing and landed on the floor below to escape his assailants			0
he can be seen writhing in pain , holding his leg			0
doctors later said he suffered a fractured vertebrae and a broken ankle			0
@entity34 , pursued by armed assailants , hikes up his trousers and throws himself over a railing to escape the knife - wielding inmates @entity34 , seen on the floor after his fall , broke his ankle and shattered a vertebra when he landed on story below @entity34 is believed to be the leader of a violent @entity16 street gang @entity34 was awaiting trial on charges he tried to intimidate witnesses testifying against two gunmen accused of killing one of @entity34 ' rivals and his 10 - month - old son			1
the @entity38 reports that police suspect @entity34 ordered the hit , but have been unable to produce evidence to charge him			0
the beleaguered @entity85 said it is still working to figure out why the doors in the maximum security wing opened			2
inmates in that wing are never let out of their cells more than a few at a time and are never allowed to mingle in common areas together			0
in may , a similar incident allowed the computerized control panel to open all doors on the wing when a guard accidentally pushed the wrong button			2
after that happened , a safety was installed that forced jailers who pressed the button to open all doors to confirm the selection first			2
still the @entity18 claims that no jailer released the doors			0
@entity34 ' lawyer questions that conclusion .			0

computer *glitch* blamed for doors at @entity22 being thrown open
some question whether some inmates knew the doors would be unlocked
at least two inmates ganged up on rival gang member and attacked him with prison shivs
