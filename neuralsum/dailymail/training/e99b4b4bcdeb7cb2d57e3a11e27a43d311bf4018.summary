@entity1 boss @entity0 faces the sack before the season starts			1
@entity4 can reveal that the owners of the east @entity7 club had come to an agreement to give @entity0 ten games into the new season to assess the situation			1
but after @entity14 ’s criticism of @entity0 , especially with regard to the £ 15million signing of @entity17 last summer , matters have come to a head and caused a massive issue between the dynamic of co-owner @entity21 , and assistant @entity22			1
but issues over the buying of players and complications involving favoured agents have now come into the equation			2
as revealed in this column nine months ago there is a big issue between the club 's owner and @entity0 over the future of @entity49			1
@entity50 and @entity51 are two potential successors to @entity0			1
bench mark : @entity14 has admitted the club put all their eggs in one basket when signing @entity17 difference of opinion : while @entity0 does n't want to keep him , @entity1 want @entity49 to stay @entity59 moving to avoid @entity60 getting caught out @entity60 chief executive @entity59 is seeking to finalise a series of signings over the next fortnight			1
why is @entity64 moaning about @entity66 ’s commercially led pre season schedule ? why did n’t he put his foot down when the arrangements were being made ? given the complexities of top end deals especially after a @entity71 he has a long shortlist			1
but that is not a scattergun approach , just a way of making sure the club do n’t get caught out like they were last summer when they devoted most of their time and focus trying to sign @entity78			1
when that fell through the club ran out of time to pursue other targets and @entity83 ’ ill fated reign was undermined from the outset because of a decaying squad			1
@entity86 of @entity87 , @entity89 ’s @entity88 ( who is also wanted by @entity90 ) , and @entity91 of @entity90 are three prime targets			2
as is @entity94 @entity93 of @entity95			2
forward fast : @entity59 will continue to chase @entity86 ( top left ) , @entity88 ( top right ) , @entity93 ( bottom left ) and @entity91 ( bottom right ) as @entity60 's chief seeks to learn from mistakes @entity102 eye up @entity103 @entity102 are set to make another attempt to lure @entity103 from @entity66			1
but the @entity107 international centre - half ’s head could be turned by reported interest from @entity109			0
wanted man : @entity66 and @entity107 defender @entity103 is being courted again by @entity102 @entity111 make move for @entity114 @entity113 having lured @entity115 back to @entity111 to supplement his strike force @entity111 boss @entity117 has said he has completed all transfer business			1
but the @entity119 may yet seek to bolster their attacking options by making a move for @entity114 @entity122			1
the 22 - year - old plays for @entity124 and has also attracted the interest of @entity66			1
@entity126 : @entity111 may yet seek to bolster their attack by making a move for @entity122 ( no 10 ) i am hearing @entity49 has had a loan move to @entity131 proposed to him			1
but the player who wants a new contract with @entity1 or a move wants to stay in the @entity135 as he seeks to justify the hype about him			2
unwanted : @entity49 is not part of @entity0 's plans at @entity1 i am also hearing @entity139 , who hope to seal the permanent signing of @entity142 this week , are also seeking to take another @entity111 player on loan for a season			1
@entity146 wants 22 - year - old winger @entity147			0
@entity148 and @entity1 are also interested			0
sought after : @entity147 's ( left ) performances have made him a loan target for a number of clubs mon : @entity153 retires as an @entity154 … revealed @entity155 here			1
what a pity @entity153 was not given the skipper ’s armband ahead of @entity159			0
tue : @entity60 thrash @entity160 7 - 0 in @entity162 ’s first game			0
last year they lost 1 - 0 to the @entity164 under @entity83			0
proof that rule of fear in football still works			0
weds : @entity169 finally signs for @entity170 … as predicted here			0
what a way to end a great career of a great player ridiculously ridiculed by so many			2
thurs : @entity162 quite rightly argues over @entity60 ’s pre-season worldwide marketing tour			0
but will the club bend ? @entity162 wo n’t			2
so could he be a one season wonder			2
fri : @entity115 returns to @entity111			1
clever buy by @entity117 … then again who recalls what happened when the @entity119 took @entity179 back ... to find out check out @entity180 @entity181 it would be naive to read too much into @entity60 ’s 7 - 0 win over @entity160 in @entity185 ’s first game in charge			0
but as predicted @entity162 set out his stall by playing three at the back , a 3 - 4 - 3 cum 3 - 5 - 2 system			2
it has been the preferred game plan of the @entity94 for years			0
so it was rather naive for some observers to wax lyrical over some sort of tactical revolution created by @entity162			0
his system has its dna in the old @entity201 formation which went out of fashion at the end of the @entity204 , when wing halves like @entity206 dropped back to become second centre halves			2
even so playing three at the back , either with three centre halves or two backs with a sweeper , has come in and out of the @entity214 game , often with good effect			0
@entity102 used it for a period in the @entity218			1
and of course it worked well for @entity154 under @entity220 at @entity221 and @entity222 98 under @entity223			0
the mind of the boss : @entity162 gave a glimpse of his tactical intentions with @entity60 in the 7 - 0 win over @entity160 indeed @entity223 used the system when in charge at @entity111 and still thinks it is the way forward for the @entity154 national side			1
but the first team to use to system in the modern era was @entity236 who under manager @entity237 and influential coach a certain @entity238 played in the top flight in the early @entity218			0
one of the key players of the three man back line was a player called @entity245			0
a @entity246 ? no he was born in @entity248 , north @entity7			0
those who argue @entity214 defenders ca n’t adapt to play three at the back talk tosh			0
indeed @entity162 might even turn @entity252 and @entity253 into international class players			0
system : @entity223 used the 3 - 5 - 2 system when in charge at @entity111 and still thinks it is the way forward for @entity154 @entity259 many argued after he announced his international retirement that @entity153 did n’t have many great games in the 114 times he played for @entity154			1
that ’s a bit harsh but it ’s true he was never the constant force of nature for country that he has been for so long for @entity102			1
one stand out display though springs to mind in the early days of his @entity154 career was his role in @entity154 ’s 5 - 1 over @entity277 in @entity278 in 2001			0
there were plenty of fine performances by @entity154 players that night and @entity153 was brilliant			0
perversely though there is strong argument that that result saw @entity154 slide into a comfort zone under @entity288 and the @entity289 realise they needed to revolutionise the structure of their national game			0
highlight : one of @entity153 's finest hours in an @entity154 shirt was in the 5 - 1 win over @entity277 in 2001			2

@entity0 may be out the door before the season gets underway
a dispute with the club 's ownership may spell the end for @entity0
@entity14 criticised the £ 15million signing of @entity17
there is a big issue over the future of young talent @entity49
@entity49 has had a loan move to @entity131 proposed to him
@entity59 is moving quick in the transfer market to avoid getting caught out again , as he did last summer with only one signing
@entity102 are set to make another attempt to sign @entity103
@entity111 could bolster their options further with a move for @entity124 's @entity114 attacking *midfielder* @entity122
