by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 09:56 est , 12 march 2014 @entity2 has branded the boys who accused her husband of molesting them as money - hungry liars as she opened up in her first on - camera interview since the 2012 scandal			1
' i think they were manipulated			0
once lawyers came into the case they thought there was money , ' she said of the multiple young boys who accused her husband @entity14 of sexual abuse			1
' i think people need to know that @entity14 is not guilty			1
you can see all the discrepancies in the trial , ' she told @entity21 's @entity20			2
' i believe he showered with kids and that ’s the generation that @entity14 grew up in			2
' maintaining innocence : @entity2 said that her husband never sexually assaulted young boys even though he was found guilty on 45 counts of sex abuse and is now spending his life in prison ' rough time ' : mrs @entity2 said that her family has been extremely supportive - with the exception of her adopted son @entity33 who was going to testify that @entity14 sexually assaulted him as a teen her husband is now serving between 30 and 60 years in prison after being found guilty of 45 counts relating to child molestation			1
the former @entity40 assistant football coach was accused of inappropriately touching the boys both in the locker room showers and in a basement bedroom in the @entity2 's @entity45 home			1
in the trial testimony , at least one of the boys said that he was screaming for help when @entity14 molested him in the basement , and he hoped that @entity2 would come to his aid because he knew that she was in the house			1
@entity2 , who was never criminally charged herself , showed @entity20 the bedroom where the boy alleged the abuse took place			1
in the room : @entity2 showed today 's @entity20 the bedroom in the basement where one of the abused children said that he was sexually assaulted by the former football coach ' there was nothing that went on because i was here i mean i will take you downstairs			1
it is not a dungeon			0
it is not what that kid said , ' @entity2 said			2
@entity20 noted that because of their ' small house ' , it would be difficult for her not to hear screams			0
' because he did n't scream , ' she said			2
she also defended herself against critics who have called her a weak enabler to allow her husband 's years of abuse to continue unabated			2
' they called me sarge because i kept everybody in line , ' she said			0
teary - eyed : @entity2 opens up about how prison has changed her husband , former assistant @entity40 football coach @entity85 behind bars : @entity2 , seen center in october , was found guilty on 45 of 48 counts of child abuse and will spend between 30 and 60 years behind bars - depending on how long he lives she told about her weekly trips to the maximum security prison where he is living , and how it takes her more than three hours each way to spend just an hour with him			1
during the day , he is confined to his cell 23 hours every day , and then the remaining hour he is let out in an outdoor ‘ cage ’ while wearing waist chains and handcuffs - but even that respite depends on the weather			0
he also makes a weekly trip to the prison ’s law library where he is able to spend two hours reviewing other cases in order to help strengthen his appeal case			2
she said that they talk of his appeal often and he remains very hopeful about his chances of being exonerated			0
‘ he reads , he meditates her writes he has a tv which is a lifesaver for him , ’ she said			0
‘ i really have n’t seen a whole lot of changes in him			0
‘ @entity14 's still a happy person and he smiles and he tries to make people laugh			1
he said “ i ’m in the situation i ’m in and i ’m going to make the best i can			0
” ’ opening up : @entity2 started to cry when she told how her husband of 46 - years wrote to a friend saying that the things he missed most were his grandchildren and doing ' special things with friends ' @entity2 gave some insight into her husband 's life inside the walls of a maximum security prison			1
' a friend had written to him and asked him what he missed , what did he take most for granted ? ' she said			0
' he said family meals , the fun time with the grandkids playing ball , ( and ) doing special things with friends			0
' she broke down in tears in the middle of her sentence , pausing to compose herself before continuing			0
@entity2 was the one to bring up their adopted son @entity148 , who was willing to testify for the state prosecutors about how he underwent seven years of abuse at the hands of his father			1
he testified in a grand jury investigation that he was not abused by his father but then was planning to recant that testimony during the open court proceedings			0
@entity33 spoke about the abuse , and whether or not his father 's actions were an open secret in the football - loving community , in a documentary that premiered at @entity163			1
support : @entity2 stood by her husband and was at his side during his 2012 trial during the @entity21 interview , @entity2 accused him of being a liar and a thief , who not only stole money from their family but also stole her husband 's championship rings			1
she said that even though they had taken him in for ' 15 , 16 , 17 ' years , he turned on them and tried to get his siblings to do the same			0
' our whole kids do not believe him either , he tried to get someone of them to turn			0
money was a motive , he had some financial problems , ' she said			0
one major inconsistency that was repeated throughout the hour - long interview , which was posted online in spite of only a fraction of it being aired on today , was the amount of time that she has known her husband			2
early on in the interview , mrs @entity2 said : ‘ i have known @entity14 for 38 years			1
we 've been married for 37			0
’ she repeated that at a later point as well			0
their side : @entity2 was accompanied by documentary film maker @entity199 who believes that @entity14 , @entity202 and the @entity40 administrators have all been wrongly accused those numbers effectively erase a decade of their relationship : @entity2 and @entity85 got married in 1966 meaning that they have been a couple for 47 years			1
she said as much in a letter to the judge that she wrote in 2012 pleading for a lesser sentence			2
‘ i am @entity2 , @entity85 's wife of 46 years in september			1
it is with a heavy heart i write this to you			0
i have known @entity14 for 47 years and he has always been truthful with me , even if it hurt , ’ she wrote in the october 2012 letter			1
the inconsistency even continued further with @entity20 , as he actually read quotes from the letter and adjusted the number of years to reflect what @entity2 had said earlier in the interview			1
no explanation was given for the mistake			0
she ended her talk by apologizing to the ‘ many ’ people who had been hurt by the scandal - specifically citing the @entity228 , her children , the @entity40 administrators who lost their jobs and are the subject of their own criminal investigations - but she chose not to include the young victims among the injured parties .			2
