a homeless man who received a surprise meal and hotel stay after spending a $ 100 donation on food for his friends has insisted that no part of the experience was a hoax - despite the fact one witness is claiming the whole thing was a set - up			1
the man - named only as @entity14 - had been filmed living on the streets of @entity17 , before being taken to a sushi restaurant , given a hotel room with hot tub and treated to a new suit and haircut			1
but the resulting video posted online by ' serial prankster ' @entity24 was met with varying degrees of skepticism , with a number of viewers dismissing it as a hoax			2
one witness , in particular , has insisted that there was no way that @entity14 did not know he was being filmed as in the original video he arrived at the liquor store in the same car as @entity24			1
in the passenger seat , he claims , was @entity14			2
@entity44 told the site : ' while i think the guy is homeless , it is clear that from what i saw every part of that scene was staged			2
' however , @entity14 has now spoken to @entity59 , insisting that to him it was ' all a surprise ' and he had never met @entity24 before he was handed the $ 100			1
he told the news channel : ' i appreciate it , most definitely			0
it 's all a surprise to me			0
i thought this was just a project video , i had no idea this was going where it went			0
@entity14 added : ' normally people give you a dollar , maybe five as a big tip , but a hundred , wow that 's a week 's worth			2
' @entity24 had initially set out to ' expose homeless people ' in @entity73 by giving them cash in the expectation that they will spend it on alcohol			1
however , @entity14 proved to be an exception			2
instead , he spent the money on food to share with his friends , prompting @entity24 to return and surprise @entity14 with a @entity83 meal , makeover and a night in a hotel			1
gesture ... with an agenda ? skeptics have picked holes in a viral video showing a homeless man spending a $ 100 donation on food for his beggar friends , deeming it a ' fake ' creation that was focused on making money the feel - good videos , that have gained more than 26million views , are part of a campaign to raise more than $ 120,000 , via an indiegogo page for @entity14 to get his life back on track			1
but critics pointed to a number of apparent flaws in the footage , as well as the hefty profit @entity24 has reportedly made from its success - up to a huge $ 52,000 @entity111 users have been skeptical about @entity24 's motivation , suggesting it is a ' set - up ' so he can gain traffic and profit			1
one @entity111 user , with the handle @entity117 , said : ' a large number of @entity111 prank videos are staged , ' he said			2
' i was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by @entity41			0
my part of the video was staged ... me getting scared by @entity24			0
using chopsticks : @entity24 captioned this photo of @entity127 to eat @entity128 in this @entity83 eve ' twist : the short film sees ' serial prankster ' @entity41 give $ 100 to a beggar named @entity14 in @entity73 , @entity17 - only for him to walk into a @entity133 ( left ) and buy food for his struggling friends ( right ) ' i asked him if he could give me a shout - out and put my name in the description below so i can get some traffic to my @entity111 channel , but it never happened			1
' so now i 'm addressing this issue due to a number of @entity111 pranksters getting exposed for making stage pranks			2
' other users have claimed that homeless feel - good films are a sure - fire way of boosting traffic - and consequently , money , via advertisements - on the social networking site			0
' they go to a homeless person and make a feel - good video because they know that 's going to get views , ' said one @entity111 user , referring to the site 's personalities , such as @entity24			1
skepticism : now , viewers have questioned the video 's authenticity , citing a number of ' flaws ' in the footage			0
above , @entity24 is pictured in a @entity167 photo			0
he is well - known for producing ' prank ' videos for @entity111 indeed , in november 2013 , @entity24 gave another homeless man $ 100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food			1
again , the real beggar handed over some cash			0
the user , with the handle ' 24/7 rants ' , claimed the start of @entity24 's recent homeless video - which sees the director hand @entity14 $ 100 , before secretly following him with a camera - immediately suggests it may be a hoax			1
speaking in his own video , he said @entity24 could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately , instead of remaining by the roadside			2
' how did he know he was going to spend the money immediately ? he had no idea , ' he said			0
he also picked holes in the claim that @entity14 did not notice the camera - nor @entity24 ( who has a distinctive haircut ) - following him throughout the duration of his trip to a nearby @entity133			1
after shopping at the @entity133 , @entity14 was filmed emerging with bags filled with food , before going straight to a park , where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people			1
wit his new look and wardrobe , @entity14 was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by @entity24 however , the user questioned the beggar 's choice of a @entity133 a 34 - minute walk away for his food shop - instead of a nearer , cheaper supermarket - saying : ' it seems like an odd coincidence '			1
' why would this guy , of all places , go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to ... that are convenient , probably cheaper			0
however , @entity24 argued that @entity14 chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot , saying : ' when people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down			2
' when questioned by @entity232 , he did not explain why @entity14 chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park , instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park			1
but he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met @entity240 before the $ 100 exchange			1
' i had little expectation , maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he would n't , ' he said of the video			0
' i wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on			0
no one has ever done that before			0
' giving : the camera following @entity14 as he hands food to a family in the park he was initially filmed in however , the @entity111 user claimed the number of hits received by @entity24 's previous @entity111 videos - between 600,000 to 800,000 , according to @entity259 , a site that tracks @entity111 channel statistics - could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit			1
indeed , @entity24 - who earns money based on how many users view his videos , most of which are ' pranks ' - not only scooped $ 52,000 from the film , but also gained 13,000 new subscribers			2
after the video went viral , @entity24 said on @entity111 : ' i was n't expecting to get this kind of footage			1
to be honest , i thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first			0
' he added : ' i 'm so glad that i could witness and capture such a beautiful moment			0
this has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel			0
in the footage , @entity14 told @entity24 he had quit his job to look after his parents , but after both of them died , he could n't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street			1
' the more i talk to him , the more i sense how genuine he is â€¦			0
i gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help			0
never judge a book by its cover			0
one love ! ' @entity24 said			0
another video : in november 2013 , @entity24 ( pictured , left ) gave another homeless man ( right ) $ 100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food			1
the video gained far fewer views than @entity14 's			0

@entity14 insists he had never met @entity24 before , events were not set up
@entity24 told @entity232 the events were natural and not *pre-planned*
