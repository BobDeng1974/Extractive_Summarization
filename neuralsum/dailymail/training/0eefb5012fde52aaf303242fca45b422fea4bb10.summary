by @entity0 when you see a group of women in pretty dresses , you might not immediately think of engineering			0
but one award - winning engineer has taken part in a modelling campaign to convince women that it is possible to shape skylines and take charge of construction sites , while still being feminine			2
@entity15 is wearing a floral outfit in @entity17 and @entity20 ’s new ' leading ladies ' campaign alongside famous actresses and pop stars in a bid to change the image of engineering , which she believes is in need of a serious makeover			1
l - r : @entity40 , @entity15 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 the 30 - year - old structural engineer has designed bridges , skyscrapers and sculptures with signature architects and spent six years working on @entity49 – the tallest building in @entity51 that has radically altered the @entity53 skyline			1
ms @entity15 , an associate at consultancy @entity54 in @entity53 started work on the massive skyscraper in 2006 and spent two years preparing the site before the tower could be built			1
‘ i worked on the foundation design and the spire			0
we used top - down construction , which means digging downwards and building up at the same time , ’ she told @entity59			0
‘ the “ core ” or spine of the building has never been built that way before , but it saves time and helped us get the building up quickly			0
’ the spire is ms @entity15 ’s favourite part of @entity49 , as all the details including every nut and bolt is on show			1
on top of the world : ms @entity15 , an associate at consultancy @entity54 in @entity53 ( pictured third from the left ) started work on @entity49 in 2006 and worked on its foundations and spire , which can be seen mid-way through its construction here ‘ you can tell who the engineers are [ up the skyscraper ] as they are looking up at the shard and not at the view , ’ she said			1
ms @entity15 was sad when the massive construction was completed in november 2012 but is now working on an entirely different project – the refurbishment of a @entity94 town house – as well as a residential development in east @entity53 that ‘ is technically very demanding ’ as it is over a railway line			1
‘ there ’s lots of wasted land around railway lines so it ’s good to provide housing near them , ’ she mused			0
however it is her role in @entity17 ’s latest advertising campaign that is ms @entity15 ’s very latest pursuit			2
the campaign was shot by photographer @entity110 and its cast includes @entity42 , @entity112 and @entity113			2
while ms @entity15 describes her inclusion in the advert as ‘ surreal ’ she believes it is ‘ an amazing way to showcase engineering to a new audience , especially women ’			1
high gloss tea : ms @entity15 describes her inclusion in @entity17 ' ' leading ladies ' advert ( pictured ) as ' surreal ' but she believes it is ' an amazing way to showcase engineering to a new audience , especially women '			1
she is pictured ( second from the right ) alongside celebrities such as @entity42 ( second left ) of course floral skirts are sometimes just not practical on a construction site , but she believes the campaign shows ‘ that the profession can be for women who are feminine and into fashion			2
’ ‘ engineering has an image problem			0
we need a re-brand of what engineers can look like			0
' currently less than 10 per cent of engineers are women , but the situation is improving			2
the graduate intake at ms @entity15 ’s workplace , @entity54 is 30 per cent female			1
the only way is up : ms @entity15 ( pictured left ) thinks that the @entity49 ( right ) will not be the last radical change to the capital 's skyline as she thinks more high rise residential blocks are needed to provide homes for @entity151			1
the @entity49 boasts 30 acres of space on a one acre plot ‘ my pet peeve is construction toys for boys and cupcake and cleaning toys for girls			2
i ’d love to take those images away and we have to keep talking about the benefits of careers in science and engineering in schools , ’ she said			0
as well as trying to persuade more girls to pursue a career in engineering , ms @entity15 is passionate about @entity53 ’s housing			1
she said : ‘ the @entity53 skyline will change			0
we need good , well designed skyscrapers to resolve the housing crisis			0
we ca n’t have people commuting for hours every day to get to work so we must build good quality , well designed residential housing blocks			0
‘ and one big positive is they ’ll be great views for residents			0

@entity182 stars in the ' @entity184 ' campaign alongside @entity42 , @entity113 and other famous females
she thinks the advert is a great *platform* to *promote* the profession to women , as just 10 per cent of engineers in @entity193 are female
ms @entity15 , 30 helped design @entity49 's spire and believes @entity53 needs more skyscrapers to meet the demand for housing
