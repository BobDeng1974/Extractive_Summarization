from bad fashion choices to an undying devotion to boy bands , writer @entity3 , 35 , took a trip down memory lane in a recent blog post as she remembered the highs and lows of being a teenager in the 90s			1
the post had some members of the @entity15 team crying with laughter , while the younger writers looked blank at the mentions of @entity18 or a trip to @entity20 on a saturday night			1
here we have reprinted 15 of our favourites , to read the full blog post and more from @entity3 visit her blog notanothermummyblog.com			1
it was acceptable in the 90s : @entity3 lists the things most 90s teenage girls will have experienced 1			1
it was n’t saturday afternoon without a visit to @entity32 to spend your pocket money on a kiwi lip balm			1
or if you were splashing out , @entity37 perfume			1
you were addicted to playing @entity38 on the @entity39			1
and you may have owned a @entity40			1
you went to see @entity41 at the cinema three times – and cried when @entity44 died , every time ( ' @entity45 ! come back ! ' ) 4			1
you decided if you ever got a tattoo , it would be @entity49 's dolphin or @entity51 's celtic arm chain			1
virtual friend : a @entity40 was a girls best friend as a 90s teen style icon : tattoo inspiration would have come from none other than @entity51 , whose chain arm band was the envy of many teenage girls 5			1
school holidays were spent watching @entity62 ( you really wanted to be @entity64 ) , listening to @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 on your @entity68 and avoiding any homework or revision			2
thanks to @entity72 and @entity73 , you thought @entity74 was the best place ever , and you perfected your @entity74 accent by saying phrases like ' let 's jump in the ute ! ' , ' have you fed the chooks ? ' and ' @entity81 , mate ! ' 7			2
you had to wait until 6pm to call your friends , to get the cheaper call rate			2
then you 'd spend at least an hour chatting to them , despite having seen them that day at school			2
you cried when @entity88 left @entity87			2
and actually considered calling the helpline set up for distraught fans			2
heart breaking : for many teenage girls , the crisis of their youth came when @entity96 left @entity87 cult classic : when it came to film choices , @entity98 was always up there 9			1
your hair did n't thank you for the perm			2
or the @entity106 bleach you sprayed on it			0
the @entity108 and @entity109 were much kinder to it			0
but the bright blue hair mascara just looked ridiculous			0
going to the video shop on a saturday night was the highlight of the week			0
you 'd spend at least ten minutes deciding whether to rent @entity98 , @entity114 or @entity115			0
why would you use a normal hair bobble when you could use a scrunchie ? 12			0
you knew all the words to @entity119 by @entity120			0
and at least two verses of @entity123 's @entity122			0
friends was something that was only on tv once a week			0
and every episode you watched was brand new ! oh happy days			0
you pretended you were too old for it , but saturday mornings were all about sitting in your pjs , watching going live or @entity18			0
@entity137 and @entity138 swinging their pants , @entity136 , @entity134 , @entity135 – all heroes			0
you saw @entity140 from @entity141 perform onstage with her baby bump hanging out of her crop top and cargo pants , and thought it was a look you 'd definitely copy when you were grown up and had babies saturday mornings : as much as you did n't want to admit it , the start to your weekend always involved watching @entity18 no repeats : friends was only on once a week , and every episode was brand new top tunes : knowing the words to @entity120 's @entity119 was crucial			0
