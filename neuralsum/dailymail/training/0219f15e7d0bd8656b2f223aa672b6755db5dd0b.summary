a super-antibiotic capable of wiping out everything from @entity1 to @entity2 has been found lurking in soil			1
in tests , the new medicine rapidly cured infections that should have been fatal			1
the drug also worked ‘ exquisitely ’ well against hard - to - treat bugs that damage the heart			0
crucially , it could be a powerful weapon in the war against antibiotic resistance , in which once easy - to - treat infections become deadly after finding sneaky ways of evading powerful drugs			1
with no new type of antibiotic hitting the market for almost 30 years and bacteria becoming harder to treat by the day , experts have warned medical treatment could soon be dragged back the 19th century			1
the new drug , which has been named teixobactin , was discovered after @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 scientists went back to basics and studied bacteria from a grassy field in @entity43 in the @entity40			1
many bacteria and fungi naturally make antibiotics to keep themselves safe and kill competitors for food and space and most of the antibiotics we use today have their roots in nature			2
however , with the easy - to - study microbes well examined and the remaining soil bugs difficult to grow on dishes in the lab , modern scientists have largely abandoned this route of research in favour of more high - tech approaches			2
convinced that the soil held more secrets , researchers from @entity65 in @entity66 devised a gadget that allowed them to grow and study the bugs in their native earth			2
of the 10,000 sorts of bacteria that grew , 25 pumped out substances that could potentially be used as antibiotics			2
and of these , teixobactin was the most promising			2
in tests on mice , it killed a wide range of bacteria , including the hospital superbug @entity1			1
@entity81 was ‘ exceptionally active ’ against the deadly @entity83 stomach bug and ‘ exquisitely active ’ against germs that damage the heart			0
@entity2 was also within its grasp , raising the probability the disease could be treated by a single drug , rather than the cocktail of pills that is used today			0
importantly , it did all this without producing side - effects			0
the researchers , including scientists from @entity97 - based drug company @entity96 , are particularly excited about the fact that they could n’t produce any bacteria that were resistant to the drug , no matter how hard they tried			1
they say the way teixobactin works will make it exceptionally hard for bacteria to find a way of evading it and predict it will take at least 30 years for resistance to develop			1
they are refining the recipe and hope to start testing the drug on people in two years			0
if all goes well , teixobactin , which would be an injection rather than a pill , could be on the market by 2019			2

writing in the journal nature , researcher @entity145 , who has co-founded a company that is developing the drug , said the same technique could be used to find other antibiotic - producing bugs in soil			2
in an accompanying article , @entity152 , a @entity153 expert in antibiotic resistance , said that ‘ in a field dominated by doom and gloom ’ the work ‘ offers hope that innovation and creativity can combine to solve the antibiotics crisis ’			1
professor @entity164 , of @entity165 , said it is a ‘ tantalising prospect that this discovery is just the iceberg ’			0
@entity169 , professor of microbiology at @entity171 , said the technique could be a ‘ game - changer ’ for discovering new antibiotics			0
powerful : the ' super-antibiotic ' , which was found in soil in @entity43 , @entity40 , is capable of wiping out everything from @entity1 ( pictured ) to @entity2 , scientists say however , @entity179 , leading microbiologist and independent consultant , cautioned that there are still many important infections that the new drug does not tackle			1
this includes illnesses caused by @entity186 and klebsiella , a bug that is now sometime simply untreatable			0
professor @entity189 , of @entity190 , said : ‘ the rise in antibiotic resistance is a threat to modern healthcare as we know it so this discovery could potentially help to bridge the ever increasing gap between infections and the medicines we have available to treat them			1
‘ taking any potential antibacterial compound from discovery to successful licensing is a long , costly and difficult process			0
‘ however it is one that needs to be encouraged while we tackle other elements that contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance and seek to preserve the antibiotics we do have			1
’ professor @entity213 , president of the @entity214 , said : ‘ we desperately need new antibiotics to tackle bacterial infections – this is a very promising development			0

in tests , new medicine rapidly cured infections that should have been fatal
called teixobactin , it killed a wide range of bacteria , including @entity1
could be a powerful weapon in the war against antibiotic resistance
