an aluminum scrap first found twenty - three years ago is now believed to have likely been part of @entity3 's plane			1
the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) thinks the @entity7 2 - 2 - v - 1 scrap , found on @entity8 , or @entity8 , was used as a fill - in for a navigational window when @entity3 stopped in @entity11 , @entity4 reported			1
its complex fingerprint of dimensions , proportions , materials and rivet patterns was as unique to @entity3 â€™s @entity18 as a fingerprint is to an individual			2
' the news outlet pointed out a photograph from the @entity21 , which showed where the aluminum piece was set up before @entity3 went missing in july 1937			0
@entity4 reported that @entity5 members found at @entity7 2 - 2 - @entity43 's elements were a fit with the patch , and that it also fit a @entity18 currently undergoing restoration			1
' this is the first time an artifact found on @entity8 has been shown to have a direct link to @entity3 , ' @entity26 also said			0
the scrap may indicate that @entity3 and @entity52 , who navigated the plane , died on @entity8 , the website reported			0
theory : if the piece belonged to @entity3 's @entity18 , it indicates that she and navigator @entity52 died on @entity8 search : the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) is going back to @entity8 for further testing next year to find out what happened to @entity3 's plane ' the many fractures , tears , dents and gouges found on this battered sheet of aluminum may be important clues to the fate and resting place of the @entity18 , ' @entity26 told the news outlet			1
the landing gear for @entity3 's plane may have ended up in the water off @entity8 , going off of forensic imaging that was used on an archival 1937 photograph showing something in the water , according to the website			2
it has also been suggested through sonar imagery that the fuselage is also in the water near the coast - and another @entity5 trip to @entity8 is planned to take place in june of next year to see if more information can be discovered , the website said			0
@entity26 also said that ' funding is being sought , in part , from individuals who will make a substantial contribution in return for a place on the expedition team			0
