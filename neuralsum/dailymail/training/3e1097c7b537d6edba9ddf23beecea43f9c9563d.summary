few honeymooners could hope for such a magical moment			0
but one photographer celebrating his wedding was lucky enough to witness a stretch of beach lit up by bioluminescent phytoplankton			1
will @entity7 stumbled upon the awe - inspiring sight on a windy night in the @entity9			1
it occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates , as well as in some fungi and microorganisms such as phytoplankton			0
the word comes from the @entity30 ' bios ' for living and the @entity33 ' lumen ' for light			0
bioluminescence is a type of light energy produced by a chemical reaction			0
different types of animals use bioluminescence in different ways			0
deep sea squid use it for counter illumination camouflage so they match their environmental light , but @entity49 use it to lure prey with a light - up dangling appendage from their head that draws in smaller fish , which they can eat			0
fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates by flashing their abdomens , while their larvae use it to repel predators			0
millipedes also glow to put predators off of eating them			0
the @entity66 photographer saw tiny organisms , which glow like fireflies , riding waves and being washed up on the beach , to create dazzling patterns in the shallow water			1
the minute creatures are thought to emit light when they are stressed and as mr @entity7 said the evening was a windy one , it is likely the organisms were agitated by crashing waves			1
he took a couple of photos of glowing footsteps , which are caused as the organisms can be present in wet beach and get stressed when they are trodden on , making it possible for a person to see an illuminated path of where they have walked			2
while bioluminescent phytoplankton has been known about for some time , it is only recently that biologists have worked out what causes them to glow			1
the photographer , who was celebrating his wedding , was lucky enough to witness a stretch of beach lit up by bioluminescent phytoplankton the @entity66 photographer captured tiny organisms , which glow like fireflies , riding waves and being washed up on the beach , to create dazzling patterns in the shallow water			1
the bioluminescent phytoplankton can survive in the sand and glow if they are trodden on , so that footsteps are illuminated ( pictured right ) marine biologist @entity105 told @entity106 the water is filled with bioluminescent phytoplankton called @entity109			1
the microorganisms glow when stressed and reasons for their agitation include strong waves , a kayaker ’s paddle splashing the water or a surfer carving up the water			2
mr @entity7 said : ' it was lucky for me to see such beautiful scenery and i took several pictures as great memories , but it 's sad to see the garbage on the beach ( centre ) when i zoomed in the picture in my laptop			2
' he took the photos on a beach in the @entity9 near a @entity132 restaurant that can be seen lit up in the background ‘ it was lucky for me to see such beautiful scenery and i took several pictures as great memories , but it 's sad to see the garbage on the beach when i zoomed in the picture in my laptop , ’ mr @entity7 wrote on his @entity135 page			1
the glowing beach phenomenon has been spotted around @entity143 , @entity144 on a fairly regular basis since 1901 , but there , the water appears slightly red because of an algal bloom , known as a red tide			0
mr @entity7 took photos of glowing footsteps and glowing clusters of the plankton on the beach ( pictured ) , which are caused as the organisms can be present in wet sand and get stressed when they are trodden on , making it possible for a person to see an illuminated path of where they have walked here , mr @entity7 takes a photo of glowing initials in the sand to commemorate his honeymoon			2

the waves are lit up by bioluminescent phytoplankton - tiny organisms that glow like fireflies when they are agitated or stressed
