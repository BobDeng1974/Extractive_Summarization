it was intended as a romantic gesture to welcome his girlfriend home from a month abroad			2
but a hapless boyfriend ’s attempt at setting the mood backfired when candles he placed on the bedroom floor started a blaze which then tore through the house			2
with champagne chilling and flowers scattered , @entity12 used tea lights to spell out his girlfriend ’s name and a heart			1
his girlfriend was still touched by the gesture however , as he waited excitedly by the front door for @entity32 to return , he heard a loud bang			1
mr @entity12 ran upstairs at their home in @entity36 , @entity37 , only to be beaten back by flames and smoke			1
the couple ’s bedroom was destroyed by the fire on saturday and the rest of the terraced house suffered smoke damage			1
miss @entity32 , 24 , said she was still touched when mr @entity12 showed her photos of the display – and he insisted he would repeat the gesture ‘ but maybe just with flowers and chocolates ’			1
the 29 - year - old builder yesterday said he was shocked the small candles had led to such extensive damage			2
relieved : mr @entity12 ( left ) was left red - faced , but fortunately his girlfriend ( right ) forgave him his girlfriend had been visiting family in @entity55 and was almost home when he was forced to call 999			1
‘ i just wanted to surprise @entity32 as i had not seen her in so long , ’ he said			2
‘ she called me when she was just a couple of minutes away and asked if i could meet her outside the house to help her with her bags			0
‘ i told her that i was already outside and that i was in big trouble			0
’ when the builder explained what had happened , his girlfriend simply assured him that she was happy nobody had been hurt			0
mr @entity12 added : ‘ the first thing she said to me was ‘ i ’m just glad you are ok ’			0
then i showed her the picture of the candles and she aid " wow "			0
’ the ‘ stressed ’ couple are urgently looking for new accommodation as the rented home – which they have lived in for 15 months – has been destroyed by fire and smoke			0
mr @entity12 , who has lived in the @entity79 for 12 years after moving from @entity78 , said that he hopes the experience will make other people use candles safely			0
he said : ‘ i hope this can save somebody else as i would not want anybody to have to go through this			0
’ fireman @entity87 , who attended the blaze , said tea lights reach ‘ extremely high temperatures ’ , adding : ‘ if they ’re placed directly on a plastic or combustible surface they quickly melt into the material and can cause a fire			1
' we realise that tea lights have become increasingly popular in recent years to create a relaxing or romantic atmosphere in the home			1
‘ however , many people are still unaware of the dangers that candles and tea lights can present			1
‘ the flame from a candle can quickly ignite a nearby curtain or clothing if it ’s placed too close , or gets knocked over			0
‘ candles that are forgotten and left unattended can also cause fires if not placed in proper candle holders			0
‘ because tea lights come with a flat metal base many people think it is safe to place them directly onto any surface without a candle holder or a heat resistant saucer			2
' mr @entity12 said : ' i hope this can save somebody else as i would not want anybody to have to go through this ' desperate times : the couple have gone from flowers and champagne to searching for a new home			1

@entity12 lit girlfriend 's name in tea lights in bedroom in @entity36 , @entity37
but as he waited for her , champagne and flowers ready , he heard a bang
she was still on her way home from @entity55 when builder , 29 , *dialled* 999
terraced house smoke - damaged throughout as firefighters *battled* blaze
@entity32 , 24 , was touched - but will settle for chocolates next time
