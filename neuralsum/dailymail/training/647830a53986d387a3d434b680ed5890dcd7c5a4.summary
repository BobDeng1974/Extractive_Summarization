by @entity0 , @entity1 deputy political editor @entity2 once spoke out against the dangers of using @entity5 - declaring ' too many twits might make a tw * * '			2
but it seems @entity8 have ignored the prime minister 's advice - with soaring numbers signing up to the popular website according to a new study			2
over the past 12 months @entity15 wasted almost 60 hours a week sending messages on @entity5 , it has been revealed			1
respect mp @entity17 sent the most tweets of any mp over the past year , ahead of the @entity20 mps @entity19 and @entity21 there are more @entity24 mps than any other party using @entity5 - but also the highest proportion who have not yet signed up			1
overall , 71 per cent of mps are now on @entity5 the number of mps using @entity5 soared following the 2011 decision to allow smart phones and @entity33 to be used in the chamber to send messages			1
over the past 12 months @entity15 sent a total of 718,431 @entity37 – which works out at more than 1,500 messages for each of the 461 mps on @entity5			1
in total , mps spent a combined total of over 115 days - or more than 2,774 hours – sending messages to their followers between july 29 last year and july 28 last month			1
the extent of @entity48 ’s addiction to @entity5 is detailed in a study compiled by the political lobbying firm @entity50			1
overall , 71 per cent of mps are now on @entity5 – an increase since january 2010 of 350 mps using @entity5			1
there are also 118 peers - 15 per cent of the @entity56 - who use the site			1
out of the main three political parties , 82 per cent of @entity20 are on @entity5 – 46 mps - 75 per cent of @entity15 - 193 – and 67 per cent of @entity24 , or some 203 mps			2
@entity61 , the managing director of @entity50 , said : ‘ mps are sending tweets in a far greater volume than ever before			0
in 2011 we calculated that mps spend a total of 1,000 hours on @entity5			1
that number has significantly increased			0
‘ the relaxation of the @entity5 ban , overturned at the start of 2011 , which until then outlawed @entity72 in the @entity73 has certainly helped to increase the volume of tweets sent			1
’ in 2011 11 mps signed an amendment which would have effectively banned the use of @entity5 and other micro-blogging in the @entity5 @entity17 ( right ) and the @entity20 president @entity19 ( left ) were the most prolific @entity5 users last year			1
@entity2 once warned that ' too many tweets might make a tw * * ' the ammedment would have limited mps to only ' receive and send urgent messages ' while in the @entity5 , but was defeated by 206 to 63			1
until 2011 there had been an informal arrangement allowing mps to use handheld devices such as @entity91 , iphones and @entity33 but not laptops in the @entity5 so they can keep up with their day - to - day business			2
but amid a surge in popularity among @entity15 for using @entity5 , a @entity5 committee attempted to update the rules			0
@entity100 mp @entity99 said moves to limit the use of mobile phones so only ' urgent messages ' could be exchanged - effectively banning the use of @entity5 - were ' anti-democratic , regressive and bemusing to the public '			2
she added : ' it 's a very useful way to connect with communities we were elected to serve			0
we are all adults and we are all mindful of how we are viewed in the eyes of the public and the importance of being respectful to each other			0
' she was supported by @entity116 , who said tweeting helped mps to ' stay informed , in touch and accountable to their constituents '			0
any ban would be ' an inexplicable step back in time '			0
@entity2 was widely mocked over this tweet of himself pictured speaking to @entity123			0
the @entity124 once warned about the dangers of using @entity5 @entity126 was one of a host of celebrities mocking @entity2 's serious phone face selfie on @entity5 but @entity130 said the use of @entity5 would mean mps could be prompted to ask certain questions			2
he said @entity15 were already reading ' vast tracts ' of briefs prepared by lobbyists , while ' genuine debate '' had often been stifled by @entity15 turning to speeches prepared for them by other people			0
mr @entity130 continued : ' if we are now to suggest that members are going to be allowed to @entity5 and receive comment in the course of these debates then it is absolutely inevitable that you will have people sitting in the public gallery sending messages saying ' ask him this , tell her that , read this '			1
that is not what this place is about			0
' his conservative colleague @entity157 , who signed the amendment , said one '' very senior '' mp told him the @entity5 should observe the same rules as the opera and ban mobile devices completely			2
he warned the @entity164 's report would mean '' we end up with a room full of mps staring at devices - as i can see three or four doing as i look round the chamber at the moment ''			0
mr @entity157 added : ' i think it brings the whole nature of debate in this place into some disrepute			0
i would like to see the standard of debate here maintained			0
we are the @entity180 , let us engage in detailed and logical debate and let us not spend an excessive amount of time on our electronic devices			0
