freezing @entity0 was last night facing the unprecedented prospect of gas @entity3 combination of bitterly cold weather and pipeline failures has left the energy grid at breaking point			1
the country has less than 36 hours of gas reserves remaining and one energy expert warned yesterday that if the cold snap continues , rationing is ‘ inevitable ’			1
if this happens , businesses and power stations will be restricted first , but then householders will be ordered to cut down on the amount of gas they use for heating their homes			1
@entity0 ’s gas stores are dangerously low as unexpectedly low temperatures have forced people to keep their heating on			1
the crisis deepened yesterday when a crucial undersea pipeline connecting @entity0 and @entity27 shut down without warning , pushing the price of gas up by 50 per cent to a record high			1
ships bringing desperately needed supplies of liquefied natural gas ( @entity35 ) from @entity36 are still more than two days away , and could be delayed further because of the bad weather			1
the looming national energy crisis also threatens to push up household bills for hard - pressed families			1
the government admitted gas supplies were under pressure , but @entity44 said @entity45 was ‘ confident ’ that they would not run out			1
but energy analysts warned that with the freezing conditions set to last into next month the consequences were ‘ worrying ’			1
@entity50 , analyst for @entity51 , said : ‘ if this dreadful weather continues for the next two or three weeks we should be very worried , because if we get into a position where we do run out of gas there is not a lot that can be done in the short term			2
running low : @entity0 's gas reserves could run out in 36 hours ¿ leaving the country dependent on costly foreign imports			1
‘ rationing would be inevitable , for businesses and domestic users and maybe for gas - powered electricity producers as well , so we might be looking at electricity rationing too			2
’ she said the government ’s response to the crisis had been ‘ very complacent ’			2
@entity72 , from investment bank @entity71 , added : ‘ there ’s a bit from the pipes and there ’s lng but that ’s it			0
there is n’t any more			0
i would say rationing is a distinct possibility			0
we ’re not there just yet , but it ’s a distinct possibility			0
’ energy minister @entity82 said the issue was ‘ a priority ’ and confirmed he has held ‘ discussions with industry and others about gas security ’			1
@entity89 , @entity90 ’s charity director general , highlighted fears for the elderly if the gas shortages become a reality			2
she said : ‘ this continuing bitter weather is a major threat to the health of older people , and older people need to know their gas supplies are guaranteed			1
@entity90 would like the government and the industry to offer them some public reassurance this weekend that the @entity90 ’s gas will continue to flow			1
’ the crisis was sparked early yesterday morning when a water pump failed at one of the four underwater pipelines that connect the @entity90 and the @entity109			2
the pipeline from @entity27 , which has the capacity to supply around a fifth of the @entity90 ’s gas needs , was immediately shut down by operator @entity114			2
the group said it ‘ has a technical issue at its @entity118 terminal which stopped gas flow into the @entity90 ’			2
it began pumping gas at a reduced rate later in the morning , but had to shut operations again completely in the afternoon			2
the full flow did not begin until late afternoon , and no one from @entity114 @entity90 was last night able to say how much gas had been lost as a result of the outage			2
the other pipelines – two from @entity131 and one from the @entity133 – were open during the day , although one is due to be shut down at the beginning of april for routine maintenance			1
the daily price of gas rocketed to 150p a therm – up from thursday ’s price of 100p			2
it is the highest level ever seen in the @entity90 gas markets , according to traders			1
it came just hours after it emerged that the @entity90 ’s domestic gas stores have fallen to a new low after millions of households turned up their heating			1
the stores are now more than 90 per cent empty and have less than two days ’ worth of gas remaining			1
they are forecast to be completely empty by early next month			2
as well as dwindling @entity154 reserves , gas is running low in @entity0 because of the ‘ limited ’ size of storage facilities			1
this means the @entity90 is in a worse position than other @entity160 countries when families turn up the heating to cope with cold winters			1
at full capacity , @entity0 ’s storage infrastructure can stockpile enough gas for up to 20 days			1
this compares with more than 100 days in @entity168 , 92 days in @entity169 and 70 days in @entity170			0
the @entity171 protects itself against gas shortages by storing contingencies for up to six months			2
the historic lack of storage facilities and a failure to attract investment to build new ones has helped create the current crisis			0
one reason for the lack of storage facilities is that the importing of gas , whether from the @entity154 or overseas , fluctuates throughout the year			2
in the @entity90 , more gas is shipped in during the winter and is effectively dumped straight into the national grid so people can heat their homes			2
in the summer , demand drops off as householders switch off the heating			0
this has been the case since @entity195 began exploiting the resource in the 1960s			0
consequently the country has never needed huge storage facilities			0
on the continent , the supply of gas is ‘ flatter ’ , according to the @entity203 , so bigger stockpiles build up during the summer			0
this means countries such as @entity169 have bigger storage facilities			0
analysts warned that higher gas prices now could push up long - term rates for next winter , adding 15 per cent , or more than £ 200 , to the average family bill			1
apart from the @entity154 , @entity0 ’s only other source of gas comes from the volatile @entity216 state of @entity36			1
the next delivery is not due for another two days , it is understood			0
ships can take two and a half weeks from leaving @entity36 to arriving in @entity0 , and can often be delayed further by having to stop off to deliver at other ports			1
energy analyst @entity220 said : ‘ when you run out of storage , @entity221 will need to start reining demand back in			0
‘ you get cases where ships are told to turn around and go back because @entity227 is willing to pay more			0
we can get @entity35 here , but we will be bidding against the rest of the world			0
we can get it , but we will have to pay the price			0
’ @entity221 has protocols for gas shortages , designed to stop households being affected immediately			0
power stations which run on gas are the first to be rationed			0
‘ they can do that to keep the lights on because we have coal and oil - run power stations which can be ramped up to meet demand , ’ said mr @entity220			0
but next month many of the @entity90 ’s coal and oil plants come offline to meet green regulations handed down by the @entity160 , and will not be available as a stop - gap if another shortfall arises next winter			0
after the power stations , heavy industry and factories will see gas use sanctioned			0
only after that has been tried will other businesses be asked to reduce usage – with households last on the list to face rations			0
‘ the answer is that we need more storage , ’ said mr @entity220			0
‘ we need to have enough to get through a winter if something happens to the interconnector pipes			0
can we get through the winter on our own supplies ? other @entity271 countries can , but we certainly ca n’t			0
’ a @entity273 spokesman said : ‘ in the unlikely event of a gas supply emergency , @entity274 and industry have in place well - rehearsed plans to ensure that gas supplies can continue , so that gas consumers would not be cut off			1
’ mr @entity82 said : ‘ protracted cold weather increases demand , but the @entity90 gas market is functioning well and our gas needs are continuing to be met			1
gas storage could never be the whole answer , so to think purely in terms of how many days ’ supply is in storage , is unwise			0
we have relied on a diverse range of sources for many years			0
’ but @entity293 , of the @entity295 energy consultancy , said : ‘ there is a very real prospect of running out , especially given the colder weather forecast for next week , the long , cold winter and disruptions to supply as a result of a very intensive period of maintenance in @entity131			1
’ he warned there was still a risk customers might be asked to rein in their gas use next week			1
his calculations suggest the @entity90 has just one and half day ’s gas supply in storage			0
he said : ‘ the next week is critical			0
’ the @entity311 has made £ 4million in cold weather payments to help vulnerable people pay their bills during march			1
not a penny was paid this month last year			0
price rise : the shortfall is likely to push up the long - term price of gas and could result in household tariffs rising by up to 15 per cent before next winter			1

plunging temperatures forced millions to turn up their heating
shortfall could add more than £ 200 to family bills , analysts warn
gas stores at their lowest level for three years with snow forecast
government *insists* gas needs are ' continuing to be met '
@entity0 relying on pipelines from @entity131 and shipments of liquefied gas
energy giant @entity340 was of ' very real risk ' of lights going out
@entity44 spokesman said : ' it is *absolutely* clear that supplies are not running out '
