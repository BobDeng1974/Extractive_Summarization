@entity0 took the win on stage 15 of the @entity3 as the sprinters caught @entity5 and @entity6 on the line			1
@entity6 had disappeared into the lead from the very beginning of the 222 kilometre stage between @entity11 and @entity12 but lost out in the closing stages as the chasing pack eventually put in a push			1
stormy conditions and difficult crosswinds made life difficult for @entity6 and @entity5 but they maintained their lead until @entity20 's @entity0 led the sprinting pack past - leaving @entity23 rider @entity6 in tears at the finish			1
' i was a bit surprised i could take the win today			2
maybe they had heavier legs than me after the @entity47			2
' it seemed as though the sprinters had miscalculated the time they needed to reel in the long - standing leaders , with a number of roundabouts requiring safe navigation in slippery conditions			2
but , as the closing metres were knocked off , @entity6 , who eventually came home 10th , and @entity5 - who had worked well together to keep themselves clear - dropped back into the field			0
green jersey holder @entity61 came third as @entity37 remained in the yellow jersey heading into the 16th stage with a four minute 37 second lead over @entity66			1
crossing the divide : the riders on their way through the village of @entity71 triple threat : @entity73 's @entity37 wearing the overall leader 's yellow jersey , @entity77 's @entity76 wearing the best sprinter 's green jersey and @entity81 's @entity80 wearing the best climber 's polka dot jersey purple haze : @entity37 riding in the pack wearing his leader 's jersey passers by : spectators pack the course all the way down @entity92 : cyclists of the @entity96 's @entity95 team ride past a lavender field mirror image : @entity37 in the leader 's yellow jersey leading the pack forest path : the pack rides on a road lined with trees horses for courses : the pack rides during the 15th stage whilst some horses and their riders watch on although @entity37 was not in the picture for the stage win , the @entity73 was happy to play the long game in tricky conditions			1
' at some point , gusts of wind were blowing from the side , ' the @entity115 rider said			0
' the road was curvy in a village			0
i did n't want to be caught by surprise			0
that 's when @entity125 accelerated but i was attentive and they stopped a few kilometers further			0
' i 've maybe learnt how to handle a stage race as a team but it was at the different period of the season			2
i came to the @entity3 this year after improving my condition progressively in order to reach my first peak of the year precisely at the @entity3			1
' elsewhere , @entity134 confirmed on @entity135 that @entity136 would take no further part in the tour			0
' after an impressive debut , 21yo @ @entity139 will head home to recover , destined for more great things to come			0
# @entity3 , ' they tweeted			1
@entity136 ' withdrawal does not come as a surprise as he was drafted into the team at the last minute but it does mean that @entity150 's @entity149 is the last @entity151 rider remaining this year			0
watching on : fans stand on the roadside to see the riders go past into the unkown : @entity37 and his @entity115 heading into a tunnel @entity157 view : the peloton racing through @entity71 scenic route : the peloton head over @entity161 during the 15th stage mood change : a pack of riders cycle through the rain spray : the pack riding in a downpour			1
