by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:13 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 04:57 est , 20 march 2012 as anyone who has ever paid into a lottery syndicate will know , the idea of pulling out and the group going on to win the jackpot is almost too cruel to bear			1
so spare a thought for @entity8 , who left her work syndicate only six months before her bus driver colleagues won £ 38million in the @entity12 draw			1
as the 12 - man group worked out how to spend their £ 3,169,553 shares in the winnings , miss @entity8 , a ‘ completely broke ’ single mother , was left to rue the day she called a halt to her £ 2 a week contribution because she could n’t afford it			1

her place went to another driver			2
the group represents almost a quarter of the 60 drivers working out of the @entity36 depot in @entity81 , @entity54			2
a friend told the @entity83 : ‘ @entity8 is absolutely gutted , devastated			1
that is why she had to give up playing the lottery and now she has lost out on a fortune because she could not afford to pay for the ticket			1
’ meanwhile the syndicate members were last night whisked off to a luxury hotel in preparation for going public at a press conference this morning			1
@entity93 plans : @entity94 ( left ) was already set to retire this year , while @entity38 ( right ) wants to go back to school to learn a language and aims to join a golf club mr @entity38 , 40 , added : ‘ one of the lads picked me up this morning and we headed to the hotel			0

‘ what i really want is a rest , i am knackered after this weekend			0
i am a working class lad – i am not going to turn into some @entity119			2
’ @entity120 , the depot ’s manager , would only say : ‘ the person who dropped out of the syndicate is currently in hospital			2
’ dreams come true : mr @entity23 has a passion for @entity128 cars ... now he can afford his own leaving en masse : all 12 of the workers are based at the @entity36 bus depot in @entity81 , @entity54 miss @entity8 is now the only founding member of the syndicate left working for @entity36 , after all the winning drivers quit their jobs			1
winner @entity23 said : ‘ it has been hard to leave work – a job i have been doing for years and years			2
but i had to – we all had to			0
‘ you can not drive a bus packed with 70 people when your mind is on other things , it ’s just not safe			0
’ @entity147 's take on the lottery win mr @entity23 had been a bus driver for 16 years , the last nine for @entity36			2

other winning drivers have been named as @entity158 , 53 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity59 and @entity161			0
it is thought other drivers will have to be drafted in from surrounding areas to keep the service going			0
