a doctor who has been treating victims of @entity2 in @entity3 says the sheer number of those affected and the fear it instilled in people was shocking and ' quite alarming '			1
dr @entity9 returned to her @entity11 home last week after spending a harrowing month as a specialist volunteer with the @entity13 in a tent - based facility in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the 55 - year - old anaesthetist , who is now in quarantine for 21 days , helped set up a new @entity2 isolation facility to help ease pressure on the hugely overcrowded hospitals			1
in @entity3 i was giving very basic care and that 's all you 're able to do , ' dr @entity9 told @entity38			1
' you 're not able to give intensive care treatment , the most you can do is give them fluids			1
you ca n't put people on life support			0
' the situation was overwhelming from the local health point of view and it was quite alarming			0
about 70 percent of the patients she attended to died from the disease			1
' i see a lot of sick people but there 's just something about @entity2 ... you can tell who has it , they just get this distinctive look that 's almost indescribable , ' she said			1
' it 's something about the way they move			0
in the latest stage of the disease it starts to effect their state of mind and you could just see they were struggling mentally			2
' the 55 - year - old anaesthetist helped set up a new @entity2 isolation facility to help ease pressure on the hugely overcrowded hospitals she said the ' space suits ' shown in the media that were worn by health care workers was a reality but it made working conditions incredibly difficult			1
' we were wearing the protective equipment dealing with the patients but it was very hot , the temperatures were very , very high			2
' it was definitely exhausting			0
' judging by her first - hand experience , dr @entity9 said controlling the disease would n't happen any time soon unless more resources were injected into @entity3			1
' it 's expensive and resource consuming to monitor people 24 hours a day			0
if they could get the resources and health care workers we could stop it spreading there , ' she said			2
dr @entity9 , who is now in quarantine for 21 days , said the sheer number of those affected and the fear it instilled in people was shocking and ' quite alarming ' judging by her first - hand experience , dr @entity9 said controlling the disease would n't happen any time soon unless more resources were injected into @entity3 ' i fear that people are just going to try and protect their own country but it 's not going to spread in a first world country			1
everyone on an international scale needs to concentrate on @entity3			2
' it 's such an easy virus to kill - any soap and water , alcohol wipes and chlorine will kill it			0
but @entity3 just do n't have the capacity to get on top of it			1
it spreads easily because they do n't have sanitation			0
' the doctor said even though the thought of contracting the deadly disease had entered her mind , she said her month - long stint was rewarding because of the survivors			2
dr @entity9 , who has worked with the @entity13 in war zones across the world , said the working conditions on @entity3 were quite hard as an anaesthetist in @entity11 , dr @entity9 said she was used to working with very high tech equipment			1
but in @entity3 she was only able to administer very basic care because of the conditions and equipment ' one of the first patients into the new centre we set up was an 11 - year - old girl who came in on her own ... you could imagine how scary that would have been for her , ' dr @entity9 said			1
' she was quite unwell , but over a week she got better and better every day			0
i do n't know if she 's out yet , but i 'm pretty sure she was going to survive			0
we do n't know if any of her family survived			0
' a lot of people 's families have been destroyed			0
it 's not clear what they 'll be sent back to if they survive			0
there 's a lot of resistance for people in remote villages to accept people back who have had @entity2			2
' she said the ' space suits ' shown in the media that were worn by health care workers was a reality but it made working conditions incredibly difficult dr @entity9 will now be quarantined for 21 days and is banned from touching people in case the protective suit was n't enough			1
' health care workers were getting infected while i was there , it 's not like i was n't unaware if was happening			0
' but in saying that there were measures the @entity13 instilled in us to ensure we looked out for each other			2
' to donate to the @entity179 , go to @entity180			0

dr @entity9 spent a month in @entity16 treating @entity2 victims as a @entity13 specialist volunteer
dr @entity9 watched 70 per cent of her patients die , due in part to a lack of intensive care facilities and even basic sanitation
the experience was harrowing , especially the ' distinctive look ' @entity2 victims get before they die
conditions for patients were so *bad* that ' the most you could do is give them fluids ' and watch them get worse
@entity3 does not have the capacity to control the disease without much more help from *overseas* , she said
