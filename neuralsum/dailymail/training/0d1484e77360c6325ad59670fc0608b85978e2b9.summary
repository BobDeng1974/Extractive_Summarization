@entity0 made 114 appearances for @entity2			1
by his own , brutal , reckoning , there were not enough good ones			0
on the occasion of his hundredth cap , @entity0 put the figure at no more than six or seven great games			1
he winced as he said it , that pained expression so familiar to those who have followed his career as an international footballer			2
it was an honest emotion , openly displayed			0
like him , it will be missed			0
the end : @entity0 has retired from international football following failure at the @entity21 stepping away : the 34 - year - old has called time on his @entity2 career after 114 caps @entity0 winced a lot with @entity2			1
there has probably never been a better @entity2 captain at fronting up , but it wounded him to have to fill the role of honest broker so regularly , to defend , to justify , to rationalise			1
he was at it again in @entity32 last month , sitting side by side with his manager @entity35 , laying to rest another doomed campaign armed only with words			0
he must have hated that			0
gerrard the man of action , reduced to parroting empty statements of hope			0
on monday , he indulged the @entity44 ’s fantasy of a glittering @entity2 career , too			2
one imagines it would not be his description			0
one of the greatest players of his generation in @entity51 , his standards are set considerably higher			0
@entity0 was a symbol for @entity2 , but not in a way he would have hoped			1
he came to epitomise the shortcomings of the national team , its inexplicable failings , its one consistency : the ability to disappoint			0
here was a brilliant player — one of this country ’s finest , from any era — yet where was he for @entity2 ? @entity0 will say he was rarely given his favoured central midfield role , but the problem runs deeper than that			1
it says something for the parlous state of the @entity2 team right now that a player who has so often failed to find a home in international football leaves such a big hole on the occasion of his retirement			1
this emptiness implies a magnificent career which @entity0 , sadly , did not have			2
there were echoes of @entity79 in his game , but not in his impact at international level			0
up front : @entity0 was always brutally honest when he spoke as captain in his press conferences @entity87 @entity86 legens salute @entity0 in the circumstances , then , it is mystifying that yesterday ’s announcement leaves such a void in @entity2 ’s midfield — yet without doubt it does			1
@entity93 will collect his captain ’s armband , but there is no - one like @entity0 in the squad now , no - one with his engine , with his capacity to be the best defender , the best tackler , the best passer , the hottest shot			1
these qualities were not seen often enough in tandem for @entity2 but we knew they were there and we lived in constant hope they would surface in a big game			2
on his day , @entity0 was the most exciting @entity2 midfield player since @entity112 ; there just were n’t enough of those days			1
whose fault was this ? a bit of theirs , a bit of his			0
@entity118 could have done more to make the partnership with @entity121 work , but @entity0 was n’t as open - minded as he could have been with some of his other international managers			1
he turned in some of his most consistent performances in the qualifying campaign for the @entity125 , started in a forward role on the left by @entity128			0
he hated it , but played well and was an excellent foil for @entity93			0
a pity he appeared to see any position bar his favourite as a slight			0
ultimately , no footballer of modern times better encapsulates the growing disconnect between club and country than @entity0			1
he was always committed to @entity2 , but in the red shirt of @entity86 he was a different class			2
he seemed more comfortable there , played as if free , and while he won a century of caps with @entity2 it is his performances for the club that will endure			1
the day he steps down at @entity145 , commentators will run out of superlatives detailing his great games , yet as an individual his memorable @entity2 displays are unlikely to number double figures			1
while he has won every trophy bar the title with @entity86 , his era for @entity2 , 2000 to 2014 , has been marked only by underachievement			1
glorious : many @entity0 displays for @entity86 , particularly in @entity156 in 2005 , have been outstanding irregular : there have been fewer great displays for @entity2 , with the best arguably against @entity160 in 2007 @entity161 was how @entity0 was characterised , but that disguises the uncertainty he often felt in an @entity2 shirt			1
appointed assistant to @entity166 , @entity164 said his greatest shock was discovering @entity0 ’s private insecurity			2
@entity128 once described him as timid , and initially preferred @entity169 as captain			0
the marauding warrior in a @entity86 shirt seemed almost crushed by a sense of duty with @entity2			2
@entity164 thought the reason @entity0 ’s partnership with @entity121 so often failed to fire was that neither player was prepared to commit to attack , for fear of leaving space at the back			2
far from being too cavalier , they were too diligent and sat deep , intently focused on protecting the back four and not letting the side down			0
what is remarkable about @entity0 ’s @entity86 career is the number of times he has risen to the grandest occasion : the @entity195 final , the 2006 fa cup final , a @entity187 derby in 2012 , @entity0 has saved his best for when the stakes are highest			2
by contrast , his finest @entity2 games have often been inconsequential : a friendly against @entity200 , the 3 - 0 win in @entity160			1
he was excellent in the 5 - 1 win over @entity203 in @entity204 , but that was a team effort rather than an act of solo heroism			0
ultimately , @entity0 was part of an @entity2 team that was less than the sum of its parts			1
lowest point : @entity0 sits defeated on the @entity214 turf after failure to qualify for @entity216 following a 3 - 2 defeat to @entity218 emotion : despite scoring his spotkick , @entity2 once again exited on penalties at @entity222 heartbreak : and in his final tournament , @entity2 went out after just two games following two defeats at the @entity21 he played in three @entity226 but shared in no more than two or three acceptable @entity2 performances ( against @entity228 in 2006 , @entity229 in 2010 , and arguably the first half against @entity231 in 2014 )			1
he captained his country through the last three tournaments but each campaign ended in the standard inquest , with @entity2 outwitted , as always			1
on each occasion , @entity0 would give a frank appraisal , particularly of his own performances			2
maybe that was part of the problem			0
he knew there was something missing , just as we did			0
and like us , he could n’t explain .			0

@entity2 captain @entity0 has retired from international football
believes he had no more than six or seven great games out of 114 caps
played in six tournaments for @entity2 over 14 years , but he never managed to make it past a quarter - final
captained his country at 2010 @entity21 , @entity222 and 2014 @entity257
