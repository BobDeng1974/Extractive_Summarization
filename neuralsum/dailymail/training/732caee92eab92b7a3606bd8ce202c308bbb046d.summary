by @entity0 an ' aunties army ' is needed to combat the epidemic of eating disorders and self - harming among young girls , a leading child psychologist has warned			1
@entity6 , author of the ground - breaking 1998 book @entity8 , has become more concerned about today ’s girls – and believes aunts should help bring up their nieces to increase the positive female role models in their lives			1
in his previous work , @entity6 said boys were seen as a ‘ disaster area ’ compared to girls			1
difficult age : aunties can help steer girls through the ' toxic ' influences of advertising and celebrity , a best - selling psychologist has claimed			1
picture posed by model he said parents should delay their sons starting formal education and suggested an increase in single - sex classes in co-educational schools to help them reach their full potential			2
but today , he argues , girls are giving greater cause for concern			2
harmless fun ? recent research has shown the influences of rampant commercialism and celebrity are having a massive negative effect on girls @entity6 says young girls are in a ‘ catastrophic ’ state of crisis because of the ‘ toxic ’ influences of advertising , celebrity and pornography which pressurise them to grow up too quickly			1
in his new book , @entity52 , he writes : ‘ to understand our daughters , we have to realise that their childhood is not like ours			0
to put it bluntly , our 18 is their 14			0
our 14 is their ten			0
‘ never before has girlhood been under such a sustained assault , ranging through everything from diet ads , alcohol marketing and fashion pressures , to the inroads of hard pornography into teenage bedrooms			0
’ he adds : ‘ about five years ago			0
we began to see a sudden and marked plunge in girls ’ mental health			2
‘ problems such as eating disorders and self - harm , which once had been extremely rare , were now happening in every classroom and every street			0
but more than this , the average girl was stressed and depressed in a way we had n’t seen before			0
’ however , he argues the ‘ enormous pain and confusion ’ that girls experience can be eased by increasing the number of women in their lives – other than their mothers – who can act as mentors			2
@entity6 said parents and relatives are not supporting girls in the way they did in the past			1
he added : ‘ we have n’t put enough adult time and care around our daughters , or taught them well enough			0
’ helping hand : the idea of the ' aunties army ' can be seen in the example of actress @entity95 ( left ) who is devoted to her brother 's daughter , up - and - coming actress @entity99 ( right ) parents can avoid many of the pitfalls of having teenage girls by helping them find their identity between the ages of ten and 14 , when girls start to feel a stronger sense of individuality , according to psychologist @entity6			1
if parents help their daughter find her ‘ spark ’ – something that she loves to do that gives her purpose – it will help free her from the need for approval that haunts many girls and diminishes their confidence , @entity6 writes in his book @entity52			1
he suggests parents should ask their children ‘ what do you really love to do ? ’ and ‘ how can i help you to do that ? ’ he lists skills or talents , such as drawing or dancing , that should be encouraged because children enjoy finding something they excel in			0
@entity6 writes that as children reach this age , parents should spend more time with them because it is a key period in helping girls find what makes them truly happy			1
@entity6 , who has a son and a daughter , said that parents must spend more time with their children and organise events to include other relatives			2
he said that by widening the net of parental responsibility to include women relatives , girls would feel encouraged to share problems and confide in older people			2
@entity6 said this is important because girls do not always get on well with their mothers and do not feel they can discuss certain subjects with them			1
the idea of the ‘ aunties army ’ can be seen in the example of actress @entity95 who is devoted to her brother ’s daughter , up - and - coming actress @entity99			0
the 21 - year - old , who bears a striking resemblance to her aunt , has been steadily carving out a career under her aunt ’s mentorship , starring in teen movies @entity159 and @entity160 , and appearing with her aunt in the 2010 romantic comedy @entity162			0
when @entity99 was a child , her aunt allowed her to spend weeks on set with her			0
@entity6 ’s new book is due to be published later this month and follows the success of @entity8 , which has sold 3million copies worldwide .			1
