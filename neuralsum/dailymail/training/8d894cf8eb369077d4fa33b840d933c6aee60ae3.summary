by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 13:36 est , 20 march 2012 the first camera that can see round corners has been shown off by @entity4 researchers			1
people lurking behind a wall - or buried after an earthquake - can clearly be seen in @entity7 using the camera , which fires ultrafast laser pulses at walls ' behind ' the area that ca n't be seen , to capture a ghostly 3d reflection			1
the camera ' times ' the beams of light as they bounce back to its sensors , and builds an image , which is slightly wobbly , but precise to ranges of just one centimetre			2
@entity37 and colleagues used ultrafast pulsed lasers in the research published in @entity41 - the incredibly rapid laser bursts allow them to time the light as it ' returns ' to the camera , building a 3d model			2
the system performs the procedure several times , bouncing light off several different spots on the wall , so that it enters the room at several different angles			0
the detector , too , measures the returning light at different angles			0
by comparing the times at which returning light strikes different parts of the detector , the system can piece together a picture of the room			0
' four years ago , when i talked to people in ultrafast optics about using femtosecond lasers for room - sized scenes , they said it was totally ridiculous , ' says @entity37 , an associate professor at the @entity70 , who led the new research			0
the team use repeated laser bursts to build a 3d image of the ' hidden areas ' of rooms @entity77 hopes that a future version of the system could be used by emergency responders - firefighters looking for people in burning buildings or police determining whether rooms are safe to enter - or by vehicle navigation systems , which could bounce light off the ground to look around blind corners .			1

could be used for *car* navigation systems that ' see ' round blind corners

@entity4 team hopes system will be used by police and firefighters
