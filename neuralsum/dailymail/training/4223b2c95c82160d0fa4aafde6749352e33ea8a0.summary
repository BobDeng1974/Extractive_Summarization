@entity0 handed @entity1 a shock @entity3 victory over @entity6 new - boys @entity5			1
@entity0 , a free - transfer signing from @entity8 during the summer , scored the only goal of the night at the @entity10 to send the @entity11 into the third round			1
it was nothing more than @entity16 's side deserved as there was often little to determine which team was in the top flight and the other three leagues below			0
winner : @entity0 whipped in a free - kick to hand @entity1 a 1 - 0 victory against @entity5 @entity5 : @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 ( @entity28 58 ) , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 ( @entity33 58 ) , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 ( @entity37 70 )			1
subs not used : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42			0
@entity1 : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity49 - @entity48 , @entity50 ( @entity51 85 ) , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity0 ( @entity54 40 ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 85 )			2
subs not used : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity42			0
booked : @entity45 , @entity53			0
att : 8,017 with one point from their opening two matches on their return to the big time , if @entity5 boss @entity25 had been looking at this game as a springboard to get his team 's season rolling , then he was sorely mistaken			1
readily conceding to a selection with one eye on sunday 's visit of @entity75 , @entity25 made eight changes overall , with the inclusion of four debutants			1
goalkeeper @entity24 , in for @entity79 following the former 's summer arrival from @entity82 , was not too much of a surprise			0
more so , though , were three rookies in defender @entity85 and midfielders @entity27 and @entity32			0
the resultant performance was far below @entity6 standard , especially in the first half as a disjointed city were barely at the races as they lacked urgency and enthusiasm			0
instead , it was left to journeyman striker @entity0 to net his fourth goal in four matches with a 22 - yard free - kick in the 38th minute			1
pulled up : @entity0 injured his hamstring scoring for @entity1 , which turned out to be a shock winner the only downside for @entity16 and @entity0 is that it proved to be the 27 - year - old 's last kick of the game as he appeared to sustain a hamstring injury in striking the ball			1
regardless of @entity25 's changes , @entity5 should have taken the lead after just 30 seconds , but an angled left - foot strike from @entity36 produced a fine save from @entity43 , a free transfer capture from @entity111 over the summer			1
@entity1 could easily have been rattled , but they hit back in the third minute , with a header from @entity55 forcing @entity24 into a tip - over save			0
captain - for - the - night @entity26 then struck a rising left - foot shot from 20 yards that was easy pickings for @entity43 , before @entity50 fired his own left - footer narrowly over the bar			0
after 18 minutes , @entity5 were again indebted to @entity24 for another superb fingertip save as he nudged a stunning strike from @entity46 over the woodwork			2
out muscled : @entity5 failed to score against @entity11 side @entity1 , who deservedly won 1 - 0 six minutes later , and for a split second it appeared @entity5 would be given a penalty when @entity36 seemed to have his leg taken away from under him by @entity1 captain @entity44			1
@entity128 @entity127 saw differently , however , and instead booked the @entity5 winger for simulation			0
@entity5 then should again have taken the lead with two chances in the space of three minutes , but first @entity43 made a reaction stop to @entity136 's hooked volley			2
that was followed by the towering @entity34 planting a header against the crossbar in meeting a free - kick from just outside the left - hand edge of the penalty area from @entity31			1
the missed opportunities proved costly because seven minutes from the break the @entity11 grabbed the lead courtesy of @entity0 's free - kick into the bottom right - hand corner			1
so close : @entity34 's towering header clattered off the crossbar but @entity1 held on for the @entity3 upset despite @entity0 's immediate withdrawal , @entity1 should have headed into the interval with a two - goal cushion , only for an unmarked @entity46 to scuff a seemingly simple shot after being teed up by @entity55 and substitute @entity54			2
after the break city undoubtedly dominated possession , with @entity25 replacing two of his young guard in @entity27 and @entity32 with experience in @entity37 and @entity33 on the hour			0
@entity1 , though , should have sealed the tie in the 75th minute , only for the left - hand post to twice spare the blushes of the @entity163			2
@entity164 was beaten all ends up by a 25 - yard rocket from @entity50 , before @entity166 on the follow up sidefooted against the same piece of woodwork from 10 yards			0
@entity1 , though , had the sticks to thank themselves just three minutes later , with @entity33 cursing his luck after firing against the right - hand upright			0
it was as close as @entity5 came in the dying stages to forcing extra time , leaving @entity25 and @entity5 to contemplate an embarrassing night and the @entity177 a top - flight scalp to savour			1
elation : @entity1 manager @entity16 ( right ) celebrates a top - flight scalp over @entity5			2

@entity0 put the @entity11 side ahead on 38 minutes from a free - kick
the @entity6 side made eight changes and handed out four debuts
@entity5 manager @entity25 handed a debut to his son @entity189
