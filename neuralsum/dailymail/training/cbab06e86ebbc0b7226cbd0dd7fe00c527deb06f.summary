poor timekeeping has been one of the issues surrounding @entity4 ’s troublesome striker @entity3 , who did not celebrate any of his four goals in the 7 - 0 @entity6 win over @entity7			1
@entity3 has reported late for match days three times this season , the latest being the @entity12 game on @entity13 for which he has already paid his fine			1
the @entity15 - born forward , who earned his first @entity18 squad call - up for the @entity20 and @entity21 matches but played no part , was arrested on suspicion of drink - driving at high speed last october , after which @entity4 postponed any talk of a new contract			1
and @entity3 ’s form had rapidly declined until last saturday			1
new manager @entity28 is expected to try to revitalise @entity3 , 21 , rather than sell him this month despite interest from @entity30			1
@entity4 striker @entity3 has reported late for match days on three separate occasions this season @entity3 did not celebrate any of his four goals against @entity7 at the weekend @entity34 are one of three @entity37 clubs banned from doing business in this transfer window after breaching financial fair play regulations			1
yet @entity41 , one of the club ’s two directors , is entrusted with the role of chairman of the @entity6 ’s football regulatory authority			2
only in football could this happen , with the @entity6 and @entity48 seeing no problem with @entity50 continuing to rule on regulatory issues			2
@entity34 director @entity41 is chairman of the @entity6 's football regulatory authority despite the fact his club have been banned from signing players in the january transfer window non-league side @entity57 are complaining to the @entity6 about their £ 6,750 fee for @entity59 highlights coverage of their third - round @entity6 match against @entity62			2
the @entity63 had seven cameras at @entity65 , meaning @entity66 had to take out seats and standing areas that would have brought in £ 6,000 worth of ticket sales			2
and the tv requirements also restricted entry to the club shop			2
an @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ the fee is really just to compensate costs			0
’ non-league side @entity57 are unhappy with the @entity63 regarding their @entity59 fee @entity78 ’s big bash the most unlikely football kit launch of 2015 took place on @entity81 on the top floor of @entity85 ’s @entity84 skyscraper			0
the glitzy venue was n’t hosting a @entity88 event , but the unveiling of @entity78 ’s strip for next season supplied by @entity93 company @entity92			0
the lavish party was a statement about the grand ambitions of @entity78 - born owner @entity97 , a @entity99 - based telecoms millionaire			0
family man @entity97 , who had most of his many relatives from the @entity101 at the champagne reception , is confident enough about taking his club — lying second in the table — up through the tiers of @entity18 football to have started making a film about the journey			0
@entity111 ’ significant efforts to promote women in sport continue to be undermined by their own staff on social media			0
the latest post that would have infuriated the @entity118 high command was reporter @entity119 retweeting @entity122 poker player @entity121 ’s comment : ‘ woke up with this in my bed ’ next to a photograph of a scantily clad woman			0
@entity119 added : ‘ here ’s to being more like this guy in 2015			0
’ @entity119 later deleted the post of his own accord			0
@entity131 are considering celebrity options to present their @entity134 coverage in april following @entity136 ’s defection to host the @entity137 for the @entity63 on the same day			1
possible names include @entity139 , host of a confrontational daytime chat show that focuses on relationship feuds , and football and @entity145 presenter @entity144			1
@entity146 , the regular racing anchor in @entity136 ’s absence , has won many awards			0
but he is not considered a big enough name for the @entity152 showcase because the @entity134 attracts a much wider once - a - year audience than the normal racing programming			1
@entity139 , pictured at the 2013 @entity155 , is being considered by @entity131 to host april 's @entity134 coverage @entity136 will present the @entity137 for the @entity63 on the same day as the @entity134 @entity139 is a racing enthusiast who has horses in training with @entity161			1
but to have such a newcomer presenting the race will not go down well with @entity165 diehards , especially on such a prestigious occasion			0
at least @entity144 has experience of live sports presenting , though not in racing , and working on the @entity134 requires extensive knowledge of the race			1
a @entity173 spokesman said that no decision had yet been made on the @entity134 presenter			2
@entity176 football presenter @entity144 ( left ) is also being considered to replace @entity136			0

@entity4 striker @entity3 *struggles* with timekeeping
@entity4 want to keep hold of @entity3 despite interest from @entity30
