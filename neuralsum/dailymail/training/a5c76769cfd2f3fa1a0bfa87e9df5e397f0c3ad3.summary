she 's eight months pregnant but @entity1 can still carry off a striking style statement			1
@entity3 of @entity4 cut a fashion - forward figure as she appeared at @entity6 this morning to christen the royal princess			1
forgoing maternity clothes yet again , @entity1 looked chic in a £ 169 mac from @entity12 store @entity10			1
the water - resistant coat was the ideal choice for the blustery conditions at the waterside where @entity1 listened to a brass band play out before smashing a £ 1,250 @entity19 - a 15 litre bottle of champagne the equivalent of 20 regular 75cl bottles - on the ship 's hull			1
she paired her coat with a sinemay hat with bow detail from royal favourite milliner @entity28 and black court shoes			1
as has become her signature maternity style , @entity1 chose a dress shorter than the styles she wore prior to her pregnancy			1
while the generously cut coat skimmed her bump , her legs , carefully clad in those nude tights she ( or @entity38 , or @entity39 ) is never without			0
this was to be the duchess of @entity4 's last solo engagement before her baby is born			2
@entity1 looked relaxed as she stepped from her chauffeur - driven vehicle to the quayside in @entity77			2
she made the journey from @entity79 by helicopter for the naming ceremony of @entity83 ' 3,600 - passenger vessel @entity52			0
a musical extravaganza was staged ahead of the christening of the new vessel and blue carpet , not the customary red , was laid out for her arrival			0
good show ! @entity1 with the ship 's captain , @entity91 , after cutting the ribbon sophisticated : @entity1 went for a sleek half up , half down hair style that helped keep her locks out of her face on the windy morning still working			1
. but this will be the last solo engagement for @entity1 before her due date in july she took her place on a stage in blustery conditions that threatened rain			1
seated opposite in a large grandstand were guests associated with charities that have the @entity109 and @entity1 or prince @entity110 as their patrons			2
spectators were from @entity114 's @entity113 , @entity1 's charity , @entity115 which has @entity116 as its figurehead , and @entity110 's organisation @entity118			2
@entity1 is the new liner 's godmother , a symbolic position similar to a patron or sponsor that dates back to the mid- 19th century when leading women were selected for the honour			2
@entity83 has a history of illustrious godmothers for past ships including @entity129 , who named the first princess royal in 1984 , actress @entity131 , @entity132 , and @entity133			0
@entity134 of her majesty 's @entity135 accompanied by the @entity137 of the @entity138 gave the start of the ceremonies a military flavour			0
they lined @entity1 's route to her seat after playing rousing tunes such as @entity146 , sea shanties and a march called @entity149			0
@entity1 's selling power : the duchess £ 169 @entity152 was available online at @entity10 in all sizes except 8 and 18 at 11:30am this morning when @entity1 first appeared in the coat ...			1
... but moments later it had sold out in all sizes loose fit : the @entity10 coat is not a maternity style but is cut generously to skim @entity1 's bump fit for a princess : the 1,082ft @entity52 is now the largest ship in @entity83 ' 16 - strong fleet 3,600 : number of passengers the ship can accommodate at any given time 1,082 : the ship 's length in feet 141,000 : the gross tonnage of the @entity52 five : the number of stops the ship will make on her maiden voyage			1

one is the ship itself , the other is the @entity1			0
1,780 : the number of staterooms on the @entity52 30 : the number of days the leisurely voyage to @entity199 will take four : the number of @entity202 islands the @entity52 will visit			0
they include the @entity204 , the @entity205 and @entity206			0
luxury : one of the royal princess ' numerous onboard swimming pools , complete with a jacuzzi detail : along with some comfy looking sunbeds , the @entity52 has a 28ft glass viewing gallery ( left ) spectacular : the staircase leading to the upper decks looks like something a @entity219 villain would own maiden voyage : after a @entity223 cruise , the ship will cross the @entity224 to @entity225 's @entity199 ( above )			0
