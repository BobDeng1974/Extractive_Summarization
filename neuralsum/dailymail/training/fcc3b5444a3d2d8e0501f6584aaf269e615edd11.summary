@entity1 engineers have tested a laser weapon that can shoot down drones and small aircraft from more than a mile away			1
the weapon system is designed to protect major public gatherings from drone attack , and can destroy low - flying , slow moving aircraft			1
the @entity9 system was developed by the @entity10			0
@entity1 's @entity28 reported the new weapon system could be mounted to vehicles and deployed to protect major public events			1
@entity32 , who is involved with developing the project said : ' intercepting such drones is usually the work of snipers and helicopters , but their success rate is not as high and mistakes with accuracy can result in unwanted damage			0
' the @entity42 has developed its own laser technology , with a prototype weapon fitted to a naval vessel to target drones and small aircraft			1
according to @entity1 officials , their new system can shoot down a rogue drone within five seconds of detecting its target			1
the reported development comes as concerns about the country 's military preparedness are being raised in state media			0
a front page article in @entity1 's official military newspaper last month said that weaknesses in military training posed a threat to the country 's ability to fight and win a war			2
the @entity66 has already successfully tested laser weaponry on board the @entity69 , pictured the paper - the @entity70 - said in the same report that @entity1 's military authorities had sent a document out to units detailing 40 weaknesses in current training methods			2
president @entity78 has been pushing to strengthen the fighting ability of @entity1 's 2.3 million - strong armed forces as they project power across disputed waters in the @entity84 and @entity85			2
@entity1 has developed stealth jets and has built one aircraft carrier			0
the country 's armed forces , the world 's largest , came under criticism earlier this year from serving and retired @entity1 officers and state media , who questioned whether they were too corrupt to win a war			0
@entity96 , senior analyst at the @entity97 said : ' whether you can shoot down a maneuvering , robust drone with a hard surface , perhaps with heat dissipation designed in , is something i 'm not sure about , but it 's at least plausible			0

the new laser system can hit a drone travelling at up to 110mph at 1,600 feet
the weapon can intercept the threat within five seconds of identifying it
the system can be vehicle mounted to protect large public gatherings
@entity1 officials fear drones could be used in a terrorist attacks
