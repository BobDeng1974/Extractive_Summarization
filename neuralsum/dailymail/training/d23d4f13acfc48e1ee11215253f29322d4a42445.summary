by @entity0 universities minister @entity1 has admitted that they government ' got the maths wrong ' on tuition fees the controversial £ 9,000 - a - year tuition fees policy risks costing taxpayers more than the old system , new figures reveal			1
writing off unpaid student loans is becoming more expensive than under the £ 3,000 - a - year fees regime			1
the prospect is highly embarrassing for the @entity13 , which claimed the higher fees would save at least £ 1billion a year			2
it would be particularly devastating for the @entity16 if it emerged their u-turn on tuition fees was in vain			0
they reneged on an election pledge to resist higher fees to get the reforms through @entity26			0
opposition politicians yesterday said the policy was fast becoming a ‘ money pit ’ and descending into ‘ chaos ’			0
since autumn 2012 , universities have been able to charge fees of up to £ 9,000 a year – up from £ 3,375			2
students can take out government - backed loans to cover the fees but must start repaying once they are earning £ 21,000 a year			1
ministers initially estimated loan write - off costs would be 28 per cent of the £ 10billion lent to students each year			1
but with earnings forecasts now bleaker due to the economic climate , universities minister @entity1 has revealed the figure is 45 per cent			1
the figure ‘ reflects our current estimate of the costs of @entity47 of the higher education subsidy to students ’ , he added in response to a parliamentary written question			0
when write - off costs reach 48.6 per cent the new system will become dearer than the old one , say experts at the consultancy @entity55			2
last night a former political adviser to mr @entity1 told the @entity57 there should be a rethink of the system and admitted the government ‘ got its maths wrong ’ by overestimating the amount of student debt that will be repaid			1
the spiralling cost of writing off unpaid student debt is becoming worse than under the old £ 3,000 - a - year system @entity68 , who worked for mr @entity1 during the introduction of the policy , called for action to address the ‘ big funding gap ’			1
the former adviser , now director of the @entity74 , said : ‘ the thing that has n’t really entered the debate yet … is now we know how big the shortfall is , what do you do about it ? ' how much would you need to change the loan system to actually solve the problem ? ‘ i ’m not defending the government			2
the government has got the maths wrong , plus the economy has changed			1
the £ 21,000 repayment threshold is in real terms much higher than the government expected			0
’ shadow education minister @entity92 said : ‘ this is fresh evidence that our university system is turning into a money pit			0
' the system is haemorrhaging cash that will never be repaid and reinvested in the next generation			0
it ’s time to call a halt to this descent into chaos			0
’ the figures raise the spectre of measures to recoup cash , such as higher interest rates for graduates paying back loans or further cuts to university budgets .			0
