by @entity0 a moving and visually stunning film montage has captured a woman ’s pregnancy evolving in a rather unusual way			0
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , has created the film from clips of herself surfing in each month of her pregnancy , as well as blogging about her experience on the website she surfs , a site dedicated to female surfers			2
@entity18 from a camera on the end of her surfboard , @entity5 records herself riding waves until she is nine and a half months pregnant			2
two months : @entity5 begins to record herself surfing while pregnant almost straight away two months : just pregnant , it is impossible to tell that @entity5 is expecting at the start of the video three months : it is still difficult to discern any bump on slim @entity5 in her third month of preganancy , as she continues to demonstrate impressive skills on her board often against breathtaking sunsets and showcasing the stunning @entity7 coastline and oceans , the film features a beaming @entity5 surfing with her friends as we watch her bump , accentuated by her tight - fitting surf suit , slowly swell			1
even in the late stages of pregnancy , when most women would be taking the opportunity to indulge in some serious relaxation , @entity5 is seen paddling out into the ocean before leaping up to stand on her surf board , laughing and smiling as she rides the wave before falling off into the sea			1
talking on her blog about the mechanics of surfing pregnant , @entity5 says : ‘ it is definitely getting more challenging to surf now that i am 30 weeks pregnant			1
luckily i have been surfing at least four days a week throughout my pregnancy so the changes to my body and the ways that i have had to adapt my surfing have happened gradually			0
three months : @entity5 's love of the ocean is obvious throughout the video , a passion clearly shared by her friends who appear in many of the clips four months : a smiling @entity5 playfully wears bunny ears for a surf , sporting the tiniest hint of a bump five months : @entity5 is now sporting a clear , but still small , baby bump			1
however , though she makes adjustments for her pregnancy , she continues to surf about 4 times a week ‘ i could ride all of my boards , including the shorter ones until i was about 14 weeks pregnant			2
‘ after that , even though my belly did n’t really stick out , it got uncomfortable to lie on and pop up from			0
‘ because of this , i started to exclusively knee - paddle my lovely 9ft 5in long board and learned to pop up from my knees			2
’ the surfing fanatic had to adjust her technique throughout her pregnancy as her centre of balance changed , and we see her surfing become slightly less energetic as the film progresses			0
‘ the bigger my baby belly gets , the more i have to modify the way i pop up because my centre of gravity is shifting and my growing belly makes it increasingly awkward			0
i get tired quite easily and have to take more breaks after i paddle out to the back			0
’ @entity89 months : although still surfing regularly , @entity5 says she changed the way she paddles out ( now on her knees as opposed to lying on her belly ) and jumps up to standing seven months : @entity5 demonstrates her considerable skill on the board eight months : with a full swollen belly @entity5 is still surfing , but admits she got tired more easily and needed to take more breaks eight months : @entity5 says she got a mixed response from other people for surfing when pregnant nine months : @entity5 ends up being slightly overdue , and continues to surf right up to the line @entity5 , who has been surfing for over four years , says she was careful about when and where she surfed while pregnant , never going out in waves over shoulder height , and also was extra vigilant when she fell off			1
‘ if i do have a big spill , i make sure that i am in the foetal position when i am getting rolled around underwater to protect my bump and somehow i always come up smiling , ’ she explains on her blog			2
despite her precautions , @entity5 admits that people ’s reactions to her remaining so active through her entire pregnancy were not always positive			1
nine months : surfing with her bump silhouetted , @entity5 says her doctor supported her decision to surf her way through her pregnancy nine months : @entity5 says that her four years of experience enabled her to surf safely when pregnant @entity5 enjoying her last pregnant surf before giving birth at over nine and half months the film ends with @entity5 surfing against a sunset and the message ' ca n't wait to introduce my baby to the sea ' ‘ when i tell people i am still surfing i get a strong response from them			1
most people are positive and happy for me while a few launch into the " is n’t it dangerous speech " speech			0
‘ other surfers or people who spend a lot of time in the ocean understand when i say that i take wave size and water conditions into account before i paddle out and they can imagine how surfing could be modified to suit a pregnant woman			0
‘ it is usually people with no surfing experience who seem to imagine that i am recklessly surfing massive waves on a short board like a scene from @entity149			0
unfortunately , those people often freely share their judgements and negativity			0
‘ my doctor , who surfs himself , has applauded my decision to keep surfing as part of my healthy lifestyle , recommending of course that i surf sensibly and carefully with regards to my pregnancy			1
’ life 's a beach , baby : @entity5 , 34 , surfed four days a week through her pregnancy last year and filmed her changing body as she rode the waves ' i felt like i had to learn to catch waves all over again ' : @entity169 said she only surfed in waves that were waist - high or smaller and would ask someone to help her carry her board to the beach			1

@entity5 , 34 , is a passionate and experienced surfer
decided to continue sport through pregnancy and blog and video it
@entity181 filmed from end of her surf board shows her bump grow
@entity5 adjusted how she surfed as pregnancy progressed to stay safe
doctor - also a surfer - applauded decision as way to stay healthy
despite precautions says people were often *critical* of her actions
