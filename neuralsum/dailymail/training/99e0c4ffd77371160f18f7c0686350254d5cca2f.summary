by @entity0 an elephant ’s trunk is not only long , it is packed with five times more smell receptors than humans			0
and now research has found that the @entity7 elephants have the greatest sense of smell among mammals - even beating dogs including the bloodhound renowned for its sniffing ability			1
humans were found to have the worst sense of smell across the species studied			1
researchers studied genes of 13 mammals			1
it found african elephants ( pictured ) have the greatest sense of smell , while humans were found to have the worst			1
according to the researchers , the @entity7 elephant can detect water from miles away and use their olfactory ability to detect predators at a distance according to the researchers , the @entity7 elephant can detect water from miles away and use their olfactory ability to detect predators at a distance , find food or a mate			1
the study , published in the journal @entity40 , examined the olfactory receptor ( @entity42 ) range in 13 mammalian species			1
they found the @entity7 elephant has the largest number of @entity42 genes ever characterised			1
to characterise the olfactory capabilities of different mammals , researchers examined genome sequences from 13 placental mammals and identified over 10,000 or genes in total			2
the repertoire of or genes found in any given species was highly unique - only three or genes were shared and evolutionarily conserved amongst all 13 mammals			1
yet , the @entity7 elephant had the most extensive olfactory repertoire , with almost 2,000 or genes			2
the study , published in the journal @entity40 , examined the olfactory receptor ( @entity42 ) range in 13 mammalian species			1
these included horses , rabbits , guinea pigs , cows , rodents and chimpanzees			0

dr @entity78 of @entity79 said : ‘ the functions of these genes are not well known , but they are likely important for the living environment of african elephants			0
‘ apparently , an elephant ’s nose is not only long but also superior			0
’ by contrast humans , along with our primate relatives , have much fewer numbers of or genes compared to all other species examined , possibly because we rely less on smell as our sight improved			0

yet , the @entity7 elephant ( pictured ) had the most extensive range , with almost 2,000 the authors traced the evolutionary histories of or genes using a novel computational tool to deduce ancestral genes , and then examined their duplication or loss in each species			0
some lineages of @entity42 genes have greatly expanded in a given species , such as an ancestral gene that has duplicated in elephants			0
this generated 84 distinct genes - humans and other primates only have one copy - while other @entity42 gene lineages are completely lost			0
each species ’ unique olfactory repertoire , resulting from hundreds of gene duplications and deletions during evolution , highlighted the molecular basis for differences in olfaction across organisms			0
dr @entity78 said : ‘ comparison of the repertoires of @entity42 genes among mammals lets us know the commonalities and differences of olfactory perception , deepening our understanding of the sense of smell in humans			2

researchers studied 13 mammals including elephants and humans
it found @entity7 elephants have the greatest sense of smell of them all
humans were found to have the worst sense of smell across the species
according to the researchers , the @entity7 elephants detect water from miles away and use their olfactory ability to detect predators at a distance
study found the *animals* has largest number of olfactory receptor genes ever characterised
