a new wandering wolf has been spotted in @entity1 hot the paws of the famed @entity3 , who fathered pups last summer			1
the sighting , in woodland close to the rural community of @entity8 , confirms that wolves are now starting to repopulate the area after being wiped out completely in the mid- 1940s through a centuries - long eradication campaign			1
biologists do not know the sex of the newly - sighted gray wolf but they can tell by the size of its body that it is an adult			2
new sighting : this january 5 , 2015 remote camera photo shows a gray wolf west of @entity8 , @entity1 it was caught on an automatic wildlife camera on january 5 after tracks were discovered in the snow in december			1
commenting on the discovery , @entity28 biologist @entity27 said : ' i am surprised to see another wolf unrelated to [ @entity3 's ] rogue pack down in that area so soon			1
' it does suggest some sort of dispersal corridor [ through which ] they are making their way over to that part of the state			0
but we have no way of knowing			0
' we have a number of long - distance dispersers out there that are n't collared			0
' even though it appears this one is staying in this area , i do n't think we completely know it will stick in that area or keep moving around			2
' @entity3 became famous around the world after his gps tracking collar chronicled his travels once he left the @entity58 pack in northeastern @entity1 in 2011			0
growing population : this remote camera photo taken may 3 , 2014 and provided by the @entity28 shows the wolf or - 7 in southwest @entity1 's @entity62 joining the club : the mammal went on to father two pups , seen here peering out from a den in the @entity62 east of @entity68 , @entity1 he meandered across mountains , forests , deserts and highways to the southern @entity62 , south into @entity73 , and back again before finding a mate last winter and settling down on the @entity75 and having a set of pups			1
the newly - released blurry photo taken january 5 shows a gray wolf trotting down a gravel road past a stand of tall pine and fir trees			1
though it does not show the animal 's head , it is clear from the body that it is an adult , @entity27 said			0
he adds that though it is gray , like @entity3 , they know it is not him because his gps tracking collar showed him far away at the time			0
based on the photo , @entity96 would establish a new @entity98 in the area next week , spokeswoman @entity95 said			2
wildlife agencies last week confirmed official pack status on @entity3 , his mate and their pups			0
depletion : extermination programs to accommodate the livestock industry drove wolves out of the west coast in the late 1800s and early 1900s ( or - 7 pictured ) @entity109 of the conservation group @entity110 said he hoped the state would get ahead of the curve and work to prevent conflicts between the wolves and livestock by working with ranchers to take non-lethal steps to protect their herds grazing in the area			1
he cited @entity120 @entity122 statistics that about 1,000 cattle are lost each week in @entity1 to weather , dogs , disease and other causes , while just five have been confirmed killed by wolves each of the last three years			0
@entity127 , past president of the @entity128 , grazes cattle each summer in the area west of @entity8 where the wolf was sighted			1
@entity96 and @entity132 informed him and other ranchers of the wolf sighting last weekend at the group 's annual meeting			2
though ranchers were not happy to learn another wolf moved into the area , @entity127 said he expected they would learn to live with them			2
' it 's not going to go away , ' he said of wolves			0
extermination programs to accommodate the livestock industry drove wolves out of the west coast in the late 1800s and early 1900s			1
