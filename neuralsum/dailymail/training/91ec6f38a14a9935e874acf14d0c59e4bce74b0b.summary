by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 13:15 est , 18 october 2013 high - flying : businesswoman @entity1 has been awarded £ 1.6million in damages after her career was cut short by botched post-birth surgery a high - flying banker whose career was cut short by botched post-birth surgery has been awarded more than £ 1.6 million in damages			1
businesswoman @entity1 gave birth to her first child @entity9 at @entity10 , @entity11 , in december 2008 with the help of an episiotomy - a surgical incision used to enlarge the vaginal opening			1
however , only two weeks later , the 36 - year - old started to experience agonising pain , severe difficulty controlling her bowels and an inability to stifle wind			1
the procedure had caused a third degree tear , which was not spotted after her consultant obstetrician @entity24 failed to carry out a ' proper ' examination , @entity11 's @entity21 heard			1
after realising the extent of mrs @entity1 's injury , mr @entity24 then carried out ' plainly insufficient ' repair work at the private hospital in @entity31 , said mrs justice @entity32			1
he also failed to keep a clear record of what he had done			0
' it appears that there was no proper examination carried out post-delivery , so that the severity of the tear remained undetected and thus it was not made the subject of immediate surgical repair and treatment with antibiotics , ' she said			2
mrs @entity1 , who was a vice president of @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity11 , before going on maternity leave , has since been left in mental and physical pain - meaning she can no longer work in the financial sector			1
despite undergoing reconstruction surgery and other treatment , she has been left with significant ongoing symptoms causing her embarrassment , inconvenience and distress , the court heard			2
driven : the 36 - year - old had been vice president of @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity11 mrs justice @entity32 said that the mother - of - three has adapted well to her condition - however , the experience has taken its toll on her mental health , particularly her ability to cope with stressful situations			1
she said mrs @entity1 was an intelligent , able and articulate woman who had secured a place on the prestigious @entity68 training programme after graduating from @entity69 with a first - class degree			2
by 2006 , the businesswoman had risen to the position of vice president at @entity46 in @entity47 - where she earned a net salary of 10,700 a month before taking maternity leave			2
at the time of @entity9 's birth , she had every prospect of returning to the pursuit of a highly successful career in the city , said the @entity82 justice @entity32			0
a ' horrendous ' experience : mrs @entity1 gave birth to her first child @entity9 at @entity10 ( pictured ) in @entity31 , @entity11 , in december 2008 with the help of an episiotomy lawyers for mr @entity24 admitted liability in july this year and agreed to pay damages for mrs @entity1 's pain and suffering , future medical and surgical costs and psychiatric care			1
but they contested mrs @entity1 ’s claim for loss of past and future earnings and congenial employment			0
however , mrs justice @entity32 rejected the defence case that mrs @entity1 ’s failure to return to work was not a result of her injury but a lifestyle choice - instead awarding her £ 1.59million , as well as interest and her legal costs			2
' this is a case in which mrs @entity1 ’s injury has put paid to her ability to return to any form of work in the financial sector and severely limited the nature of any future employment , ' she said			1
' many of her undoubted talents are going to go to waste			0
her future is uncertain and any work that she does undertake in future is likely to be fairly solitary and considerably less well paid			0
' after the case , mrs @entity1 said she was relieved that the legal proceedings had come to an end			0
however , she said it was ' hugely disappointing ' that she had been forced to invest five years fighting to understand what happened during @entity9 ’s birth at the hospital			0
' as yet , there has been no apology from mr @entity24 despite an admission of medical negligence , ' she said			0
' i hope that my case can benefit other women looking to minimise unnecessary risk at childbirth and enjoy safe and effective care			0
' @entity136 , a medical law expert at @entity137 , who represented mrs @entity1 , said : ' @entity1 suffered a horrendous , life - changing injury as a result of this doctor ’s negligence , which is shocking and simply not acceptable			2
' @entity1 chose to go through private care for the birth of her son thinking it was the safest option for her but , from the care she received from mr @entity24 , this could n’t have been further from the truth			0
' the consequences of his actions will stay with @entity1 forever and mean she can no longer work in the profession which she worked so hard in			1
' @entity1 was on the path to even greater success and this was simply cut short by the actions of mr @entity24			0
