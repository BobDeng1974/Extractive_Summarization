@entity0 has already been labelled as being ‘ as dangerous as texting ’ when worn while driving , and now new research claims it also causes significant problems with vision			1
a study of @entity0 users found that the headset obstructs the wearer ’s peripheral view , meaning it creates a far larger blind spot , compared to standard glasses			1
experts have now warned against wearing the device while performing tasks that require peripheral vision , such as driving and cycling , as it may be dangerous			1
this means the device creates a far larger blind spot than standard glasses motorists and pedestrians both rely heavily on peripheral vision to spot other vehicles , particularly at dusk or at night when light levels are low			1
dr @entity35 , a clinical ophthalmologist at the @entity19 , said the position of the prism that @entity0 uses to project its images to the eye was what caused the blind spots			1
he said the obstruction created by the prism poses a particular risk to motorists as it could obscure oncoming traffic			0
' @entity0 produces a significant blocking effect of the right peripheral vision ' , dr @entity35 continued			2
‘ the defect would not be compensated by the left eye and thus may negatively impact daily activities such as driving , cycling and running			1
’ the researchers analysed the vision field of three different volunteers wearing @entity0 , and compared it to them wearing normal spectacles			1
texting with @entity0 is just as distracting and dangerous for drivers as using a smartphone			0
research has discovered that using the tech giant ’s hands - free headset makes motorist delay slamming on their brakes to avoid a collision			2
and this delay is similar to that caused when drivers use more traditional mobile devices			0
however , the @entity0 wearers were able to recover control of their cars faster and more effectively afterwards			0
the study , carried out by the @entity72 , asked 40 people in their 20s to drive in a car simulator either using @entity0 or smartphones			0
their reactions were recorded when a ‘ vehicle ’ ahead stalled			0
the researchers compared text - messaging participants ’ reactions on each device to times when they were just driving without multitasking			2
they found the prism of the @entity0 impeded vision in the upper right hand corner of their vision , also known as the ‘ superior - temporal quadrant ’ , while the normal glasses had little impact			1
dr @entity35 said : ‘ the superior - temporal quadrant is particularly important in driving as the location of the rear - view mirror as well as the right - side mirror in all @entity99 cars is monitored by the right visual field			1
‘ motion detected in these mirrors by a normal peripheral visual field is what frequently alerts a driver to possible dangerous situations			0
‘ in the @entity110 , where the driving position is reversed , the potential blockage of right peripheral vision for on - coming traffic may be even more of a public safety hazard			1
‘ the right peripheral field is also essential for many other activities such as providing the ability to perceive obstacles and hazards when cycling or jogging on the roadway			2
’ the researchers , whose findings are published in the journal @entity122 , also analysed more than 100 images from the internet of people wearing @entity0 to look for variations in the position over the eye			1
they found that many people wore the devices so the prisms overlapped the centre of their pupil , which they warn could cause further blind spots			0
the study will be a blow to @entity21 , which has seen its @entity0 devices banned in a growing number of locations due to concerns over privacy			0
cinemas in the @entity99 banned the use of @entity0 in movie theatres last month , while the @entity145 in the @entity110 has warned that the device could distract motorists			2
it is expected to fall foul of similar legislation that bans the use of mobile phones while behind the wheel			0
dr @entity35 , a clinical ophthalmologist at the university , said the position of the prism that @entity0 ( pictured ) uses to project its images to the eye was what caused the blind spots			2
he said that the obstruction created by the prism would pose a particular risk to motorists in the @entity110 as it could obscure oncoming traffic a spokesman for @entity0 ( diagram pictured ) insisted there were no safety issues when the device is used correctly			2
he said : ‘ put on your shades , glasses , baseball hat , or hoodie , and you ’ll quickly see this study tells us what we already know - wearing something on your face or head may affect your peripheral vision ' @entity21 has been working with companies such as @entity183 to integrate @entity0 into their cars			1
this , warned dr @entity35 , would not be a good idea			0
however , he and his team are now working with @entity21 to help them develop @entity0 so that it can be used more safely			0
he said : ‘ our findings in this initial study show that the @entity0 device can potentially have a negative impact on the right peripheral vision of wearers			1
this can present safety issues not only to the wearers but for those around them as well			0
‘ due to these possible public safety implications , we are planning on doing a significantly larger study to further assess the impact these types of devices have on visual function and attentiveness			0
‘ we reached out to @entity21 prior to release of the study and it was clear that user safety was of utmost importance to them as well			0
‘ we are looking forward to working closely with them as we develop our next study as this would be a great opportunity for them to be involved and help drive improvement of their device			0
’ a spokesman for @entity0 insisted there were no safety issues when the device is used correctly			2
he said : ‘ put on your favourite shades , glasses , baseball hat , or hoodie , and you ’ll quickly see that this study tells us what we already know - wearing something on your face or head may affect your peripheral vision			1
‘ from the beginning , the @entity0 team has worked closely with a range of experts to develop a device that is safe for use , and after extensive study they have not found any safety issues when it ’s used correctly			1

study of @entity0 users found headset obstructs the wearer ’s peripheral view
this means the device creates a far larger blind spot than standard glasses
prism of @entity0 impedes vision in the right hand corner of the eye
this upper area is known as the ‘ superior - temporal quadrant ’
experts have warned against wearing @entity0 while performing certain tasks
activities that depend on this quadrant *include* driving , cycling and running
