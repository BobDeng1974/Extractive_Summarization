@entity0 came the same day she said the media ' want to see her mud wrestle @entity4 ' by @entity6 reporter last updated at 5:27 pm on 30th june 2011 @entity7 has revealed she suffered a miscarriage after an unplanned pregnancy , and says the loss inspired her to become a foster parent to 23 children			1
the @entity14 @entity13 told a town hall crowd in @entity16 on wednesday that the experience changed her and refocused her family 's priorities			1
she says the miscarriage was ' devastating ' and that it came after when she and her husband @entity21 already had two children			1
she says the miscarriage led to the belief that ' no matter how many children were brought into our life , we would receive them because we are committed to life			1
' fellow @entity13 candidate @entity36 has been criticized for taking too soft a stance on abortion			2
she said it was devastating , even though she and her husband , seen here , had not planned the pregnancy earlier @entity7 claimed that the media want to see her have a ‘ mud wrestling fight ’ with fellow @entity47 darling @entity4 , who is also staunchly pro-life			1
@entity4 also has five children , and has said the experience the of having a child with @entity51 strengthened her anti-abortion stance			1
@entity7 , who is touring the @entity53 for support for her @entity56 bid , showed yet more signs that she is growing tired of comparisons with mrs @entity4			1
but mrs @entity7 ’s latest bizarre campaign trail outburst is unlikely to relieve of her being associated with the gaffe - prone former governor of @entity61			2
outburst : @entity13 presidential candidate @entity7 , wearing her trademark pearls , on the campaign trail in @entity16 , where she told an audience that the media wished to see her ' mud wrestle ' with rival @entity4 speaking at a meeting in @entity70 , @entity16 , mrs @entity7 , 55 , said of the media : ‘ they want to see two girls come together and have a mud wrestling fight			1
‘ and i ’m not going to give it to ‘ em. i have great respect and admiration for the governor			2
’ the @entity14 representative is seen as arch - rival of mrs @entity4 , who has yet to announce whether she will run in next year ’s primary contest			1
this is because they appeal to the same stripe of deficit - hating , gun - loving social conservatives			2
mrs @entity87 has been keen to stress that she in an ally of the former vice presidential candidate – but there are increasing signs that she may be willing to go to war with her			2
a potential turning point in their relationship occurred earlier this month when the congresswoman strategist , @entity96 , launched into a harsh critique of mrs @entity4 , describing her as ‘ not serious ’			1
debate : mrs @entity87 at public meeting in @entity70 , @entity16 , yesterday there are even claims that mrs @entity7 may have already taken many of mrs @entity4 ’s supporters and is her slightly softer stance may win over more people in the middle			1
although both women ’s tendency to make gaffes – mrs @entity7 kicked off her campaign by inadvertently saying she would suggesting she would work in the ' spirit ’ of an @entity112 serial killer – are equally likely to put off many voters			2
yesterday , while speaking of the @entity53 currency ’s loss of value in foreign exchange markets , she appeared to blame president @entity118 for a century ’s worth of inflation			0
‘ in the last two years of the @entity118 administration ... you have lost 14 percent of the value of that dollar , ’ she told a crowd of 800 at an hour - long evening town hall meeting in @entity70			0
rival : fellow @entity47 darling @entity4 , at a book signing in @entity14 , yesterday , has yet to announce whether or not she will run for the @entity56 ‘ that means the federal government has stolen that money from you			1
you made it and they stole it from you because they 've been printing essentially valueless money and flooding it into the money supply			0
‘ i do n't stand for that			0
a dollar in 2011 should be the same as a dollar in 1911			0
a dollar should be worth a dollar			0
’ but despite her gaffes , mrs @entity7 ’s words seem to please an initially cautious @entity16 audience , whose state is one of the key early nominating contests			0
afterwards many felt she had the right mix of being was exciting enough without being too extreme as to be unelectable			0
of the other candidates , the former governors – @entity36 of @entity154 , @entity155 of @entity14 , and @entity156 of @entity157 – were seen as too boring			0
the @entity47 favourites – former senator @entity159 , pizza mogul @entity160 , and representative @entity161 of @entity162 – are thought to be incapable of beating mr @entity118			0
but @entity163 are not getting too worried by mrs @entity7			0
they claim her position in the middle of the @entity13 pool of candidates merely demonstrates how far to the @entity170 the @entity47 movement has dragged the party			0
she definitely has an appeal and there 's a sense on the @entity163 side that it might be even more potent than @entity4 , ’ @entity172 , president of the @entity173 , told the @entity174			1
‘ but , you know , she is gaffe prone and she 's really conservative			0
‘ the idea that @entity118 ca n't beat @entity7 is laughable to me			0
