by @entity1 reporter published : 11:02 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 21 july 2013 a pensioner had a shock when he opened up his wheelie bin and spotted the face of a baby badger staring back at him			1
@entity8 , 67 , had been tidying up his garden and was about to put bags of rubbish in the dustbin when he spotted the animal			1
he believes the badger fell into the bin and became trapped after climbing along a nearby wall and nosing the lid open			1
surprise : @entity8 was shocked to find a badger in his wheelie bin when he went to put out some rubbish after taking some pictures of their unusual visitor , mr @entity8 and his wife @entity21 carefully tipped up the bin and released the badger into their garden , which borders a field in @entity29 , @entity30			1
he said : ' i was tidying up the garden and went to throw some bags out and saw this head popping up , looking at me			0
' it 's definitely not what i expected to see			0
it was a baby one , and i think it must have gone in there to scavenge for food			0
' they go down the side of the house , which is a badger run , a sort of road for them			2
' they always go the same way , i think it 's something they pass on through the generations			0
' but there is some building work on the opposite side of the road and a fence was put up the day before we found the badger			1
' it 's blocking their usual path so i wonder if it got confused and ended up back in our garden			0
it 's very strange but it was quite sweet really			0
freedom : the young badger was gently tipped out of the bin into the couple 's garden , which backs onto @entity30 fields ' we get a lot of wildlife here , and we always have foxes , badgers and deer running around the garden , which is lovely , it 's like a nature reserve			1
' the couple have lived at the house for five years and said it is the first time wildlife has ended up in their bin			2
@entity21 added : ' @entity8 called me when he found the badger and said he had found something interesting			1
' i could n't believe it when he told me			0
' badger setts are most commonly found in areas near woodland and shelter , and badgers are known to walk the same routes for years			2
they mainly feed off earthworms but will eat whatever is available including fruit , insects and cereal .			0
