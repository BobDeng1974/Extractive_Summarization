by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 manipulative : @entity5 would reportedly test the kidnapped women to see if they would run when they thought he had left , and then beat them if they did local police sources have revealed that suspected kidnapper @entity5 would use a sick game to ' train ' the three girls not to run away by pretending to leave the house , only to beat them if they tried to run free			1
this is said to be just one of the manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house for up to ten years , in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging from the ceiling			1
@entity5 , the 52 - year - old man who lived in the west @entity1 house , was the first of three brothers to be arrested in connection to the case of the three kidnapped young women - @entity5 , @entity5 and @entity5 - who were rescued on monday			1
reporters from local station @entity29 spoke to law enforcement sources who said that he would ' play this little dangerous game that he would tell the women he was about to leave the home , and then he would wait and if one of them tried to open that door , he would go in and attack them			1
' ' that was one of the ways he was able to keep them there , ' reporter @entity38 told @entity44 's @entity43			0
the trick clearly contributed to the young womens ' captivity , as @entity48 stressed the fact that she feared his quick return during her frantic 911 call			0
the hanging chains were also reportedly used during the first few years of captivity , along with frequent beatings			1
scene : the women were helped out of this home on @entity59 that belongs to @entity5 escape route : the front door of a house where the women escaped after a neighbor helped them ' they were bound and gagged several times throughout the course of being held in that home , ' @entity29 reports			1
another psychological tactic that he used to keep the women in constant fear was the constant threat of violence , and threats to their childrens ' lives			1
while @entity48 is said to have birthed her six - year - old daughter @entity79 during her captivity , police are reportedly looking for the bodies of other children who were miscarried or died due to malnutrition			1
' numerous times throughout this 10 - year period , that some of the women became pregnant and that they would be beaten , forcibly hit in the stomach to force a miscarriage , if you can imagine that , ' @entity29 reporter @entity38 told @entity44			1
reunited : @entity5 ( centre ) at the @entity95 alongside her emotional sister ( left ) and the daughter that she gave birth to during the 10 years she was held against her will @entity79 , like her mother , was said to be dehydrated and malnourished , but eventually given the all - clear by a local hospital following their rescue			1
other children are thought to have suffered a different fate , as cadaver dogs were brought to the house by investigators searching for the bodies of any other children			0
the ongoing investigation of the house has led investigators to believe that while the girls were kept on the property by the boarded windows , padlocked doors , and chicken wire - laden fence , they may have been able to access multiple rooms inside the home			1
neighbors of @entity5 said that when police raided the three - storey property , they went straight upstairs and hauled the girls out			1
at the top of the property at the back is a smashed window - thought to be the attic - which could have been broken in an attempt to attract attention to themselves or wriggle out to freedom			0
investigation : @entity135 agents remove evidence from the house where three women who had disappeared as teenagers approximately ten years ago , were found alive on monday the back of the home of @entity5 on @entity141 : one neighbor says she once saw a little girl looking out of the house 's attic window locked in : @entity5 used chicken wire and blue tarpaulin to make an eight - foot high fence and let the trees and bushes go overgrown so nobody could see in @entity5 , 52 @entity152 , 54 @entity153 , 50 it now appears the girls were not just held in the basement as had previously been thought , but could have had their own room in the four - bedroom house			1
@entity159 reported they could even have been untied at different times rather than being on constant lockdown			0
@entity162 can also reveal that @entity5 , who owned the house and has been arrested along with his two brothers , turned it into a ' fortress ' by setting up a stockade round the back			0
he used chicken wire and blue tarpaulin to make an eight - foot high fence and let the trees and bushes go overgrown so nobody could see in			0
the house is now the center of an @entity135 investigation after @entity48 , 27 , @entity176 , 23 and @entity5 , 30 , were all found there after being missing for around ten years			2
neighbors said that @entity5 used to be seen very often at the property but in recent years had only been there a few times a week , to the extent that it was thought the property was vacant and that he was using it as an investment			2
meanwhile , @entity1 police allege , the three girls remained trapped inside , meaning they could have had to wait for days at a time to eat			1
the back windows of the house are either boarded up or have the curtains drawn and even the large garage style building in the back garden has its windows covered			0
found : @entity5 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) were found alive in @entity1 on monday afternoon map : the girls had been held captive in a home less than four miles from where they went missing ten years ago @entity196 , 39 , who lives three houses down from @entity5 's home , said that he was just arriving home yesterday when neighbor @entity199 heard the cries from @entity5			1
he said : ' @entity5 was at the front door banging on it and screaming so @entity203 ( @entity199 ) pulled it open from the bottom , there was a bit sticking out			0
' he was about to go back in for the other two when the police arrived and went straight upstairs			2
she told them that 's where the girls were			2
' inside the house there is a staircase up when you go in , and behind it there is one going down			2
' on the second floor there are four bedrooms , and then there 's the attic at the top			0
' the other two girls came right out			2
@entity5 had a kid with her			0
from what i gather they were being held in separate rooms , not just the basement			0
' mr @entity196 said that @entity5 was ' hiding in plain sight ' all these years and that only last sunday he was in the park with the same child , a girl of six			2
he said : ' @entity5 was acting all happy families , like it was his own daughter			0
they played with my son 's girl and he bought her a pastry at the bakery			0
' it was like they were a family			0
i ca n't believe it ' .			0
