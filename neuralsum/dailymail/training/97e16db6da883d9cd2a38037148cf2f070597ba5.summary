by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 01:37 est , 30 may 2012 for 24 years , @entity1 was either under house arrest or too fearful that if she left @entity4 , the government would never let her return			1
now , in a sign of how much life there has changed , she 's back to being a world traveler			1
@entity11 's towering skyscrapers and sprawling urban lights will be the opposition leader 's first glimpse of the outside world when she lands tuesday night to kick off a tour of two continents			1
it 's a stark contrast to the sleepy city of @entity20 , where the former military regime kept her a prisoner in her own home for a total of 15 years			2
respected : @entity4 opposition leader @entity1 pictured at a press conference following a meeting with @entity29 prime minister @entity28 last tuesday @entity1 was to spend several days in @entity30 , where she 'll speak friday at the @entity31 on @entity32			2
she 'll return to @entity4 briefly and head to @entity34 in mid-june , with stops including @entity36 and @entity37 - to formally accept the @entity38 she won 21 years ago			1
in @entity39 , she 'll share a stage with @entity42 frontman @entity41 , a staunch @entity1 supporter , at a concert in her honor , according to @entity46 media			1
in @entity47 , she has been given the rare honor of addressing both houses of @entity50			1
@entity52 's @entity51 says she also plans to stop in @entity53			1
distinguished : the political prisoner met with the @entity29 leader ahead of her foreign trip prison : the riverside spot where @entity1 was detained under house arrest by the military regime in @entity20 , @entity4 the tour marks @entity1 's latest step in a stunning trajectory from housewife to political prisoner to opposition leader in @entity50 , as @entity4 opens to the outside world and sheds a half century of military rule			1
meetings with world leaders are planned along the way as dignitaries line up to shake @entity1 's hand			1
the last time the 66 - year - old @entity75 laureate flew abroad was a year before the @entity76 came down , in april 1988 , when she traveled from @entity78 to @entity4 to nurse her dying mother			2
until then she had led an international lifestyle , growing up partly in @entity29 , where her mother was ambassador			2
the world was a different place the last time @entity1 left @entity4			1
the @entity76 and the @entity84 still existed			2
@entity11 , the city @entity1 visits this week , now has towering skyscrapers , a subway and elevated rail system and slightly milder traffic jams			2
elsewhere in 1988 : she later attended @entity90 , worked for the @entity91 in @entity92 and @entity93 and then married @entity95 academic @entity94 and raised their two sons in @entity47			1
@entity1 returned to @entity4 just as an uprising erupted against the military regime			2
as daughter of gen. @entity1 , the country 's independence hero , she was thrust into the forefront of demonstrations until the military brutally crushed the protests and locked her under house arrest in 1989			2
over the next two decades she became the world 's most famous political prisoner			1
during intermittent periods of freedom , she declined opportunities to go abroad for fear she would not be allowed to re-enter @entity4			0
@entity1 's commitment to the cause came at high personal cost			0
in 1999 , she stayed in @entity4 even as her husband was dying of cancer in @entity47			0
they last saw each other in 1995 , after which the junta denied @entity94 a visa			0
after her release from house arrest in november 2010 , @entity1 had an emotional reunion with her youngest son , @entity126 , when the junta gave him a visa after a decade - long separation			0
the @entity47 leg of @entity1 's trip is bound to include some family time			1
she will celebrate her 67th birthday on june 19 while in @entity47 , where @entity126 lives			0
@entity1 's aides have offered few details about her trip aside from the destinations , saying only that she will pack medicine for motion sickness			1
' she gets airsick and seasick very easily			0
she will have to take her pills to prevent airsickness , ' said @entity142 , a senior official from her @entity143			0
he said she was typically stoic ahead of her travels : ' she does n't look too excited about it			0
' @entity30 was not part of the original itinerary but @entity1 decided last week to attend the economic forum			0
she has a friday speaking slot that is bound to be the event 's main attraction			0
@entity1 's appearance at the conference had threatened to upstage that of @entity4 president @entity155 , but he canceled over the weekend citing ' urgent matters ' at home , said @entity159 spokesman @entity158			0
he rescheduled his first official visit to @entity30 for next week			0
sad : @entity1 's commitment to her cause came at high personal cost			0
in 1999 she stayed in @entity4 even as her husband was dying of cancer in @entity47			0
they last saw each other in 1995 , after which the junta decided mr @entity94 needed a visa @entity1 with her sons @entity172 ( left ) and @entity126 ( right ) in @entity20 in the 1980s finally : clasped hands of @entity1 as she was reunited with her son @entity126 at the @entity175 in november 2010 @entity155 took power last year from the military junta following elections that were deemed unfair by international observers			1
since then he has surprised much of the world by engineering sweeping reforms , though military leaders still have great control over the country			1
since @entity1 's release , many international dignitaries have visited her in @entity4 , including @entity187 secretary of state @entity188 in december and @entity95 prime minister @entity190 in april			1
@entity190 suggested she visit her ' beloved @entity90 ' in june			0
@entity1 replied at the time : ' two years ago i would have said ' thank you for the invitation , but sorry			0
' ' but now i am able to say ' perhaps , ' and that 's great progress			0
