@entity1 batsman @entity0 scored the fastest - ever one - day international century as @entity1 piled on the runs in a crushing 148 - run defeat of the @entity5			1
the number three needed 31 deliveries to reach the milestone in the second odi in @entity10 , five fewer than previous record holder @entity11 , who needed 36 balls to pass the mark against the same opposition last year			1
the @entity16 ended their innings on 439 for two , four runs shy of the highest ever @entity9 score by a team - set by @entity19 in 2006 against @entity20			0
and it was a target that proved well beyond the tourists , who reached 291 for seven in reply with @entity26 ( 64 ) and @entity27 ( 57 ) the highlights of a respectable - if futile - chase			0
@entity0 celebrates his stunning century in 31 deliveries against @entity5 in @entity10 @entity31 reached his landmark five balls quicker than @entity34 's @entity11 did in 2014 @entity35 salutes @entity31 as the @entity36 leaves the ground after his dismissal @entity35 and @entity31 , who are team - mates in the @entity40 , shake hands 1			1

@entity61 scored 128 from 115 balls before he was caught at mid-off to give @entity67 a wicket , while @entity60 finished unbeaten on 153 from 142 deliveries			2
but it was largely the @entity31 show and he quickly broke @entity73 's 19 - year record for the fastest odi fifty , taking a mere 16 deliveries to achieve the feat by launching @entity77 over the long - off boundary			1
he then needed a further 15 balls to break @entity11 's year - old fastest odi century record - smashing 10 sixes and eight fours in doing so			1
any @entity83 hopes that @entity31 would subsequently relax were soon dismissed as he and @entity60 continued to pepper the @entity85 boundary on regular occasion			0
@entity31 soon set his sights on breaking another record - the most sixes in an individual odi innings - and equalled the record @entity91 set in 2013 against @entity93 when he smashed his 16th maximum on the penultimate ball of the penultimate over			1
@entity31 hits a delivery during the second one - day international against the @entity5 @entity67 ( left ) attempts a catch after making a delivery to @entity1 captain @entity31 the wicketkeeper - batsman could not score another to make the record his own , however , when he went for another huge hit off @entity104 and was caught at deep extra cover with two balls left having scored 149 from 44 balls			1
@entity108 received a standing ovation from the crowd at the wanderers as he made his way off the field , and he was saluted by @entity83 batsman @entity35			2
@entity31 and @entity35 , who are team - mates in the @entity40 with the @entity115 , then shook hands just before end end of @entity1 's innings			1
@entity60 and @entity119 saw out proceedings for @entity1 , while @entity5 ' daunting task became even more difficult when @entity35 pulled @entity122 to @entity123 for 19			1
@entity124 came and went for a single but @entity26 and @entity126 tried to make a fight of it with a fourth - wicket stand of 59 before the former was removed by @entity123			0
@entity131 then ended @entity133 ' stay on 40 before another successful partnership of 83 was built between @entity27 and @entity135			0
however , the runs could not come quickly enough despite their best efforts and @entity135 fell for 40 to @entity138 with @entity104 soon following for a duck			0
@entity31 is all smiles after hitting a century against the @entity5 at the @entity85 1			1
443 - 9 – @entity19 vs @entity141 , @entity142 , july 2006 2			0

418 - 5 – @entity1 vs @entity51 , @entity52 , september 2006 = 418 - 5 – @entity58 vs @entity5 , @entity143 , december 2011 @entity27 was the last wicket to fall , @entity145 taking the catch at deep square leg to give @entity122 his second scalp , with the damage largely done before @entity5 had even arrived at the crease			2
speaking on @entity151 , @entity31 said : ' i think i was on 92 when i realised it had to be close			0
' i was never sure how many balls it was that @entity11 took to get to 100 but i knew i had to be close and i was n't going to take ones in the 90s			0
' ( coach ) @entity104 ( @entity158 ) actually made a really good call towards the end of the innings asking me to go in			0
i wanted @entity119 ( @entity119 ) to go in to go and take the left - arm spinner on			0
' i sort of played my knock even before i went out to bat and the word aggression was probably the thing for me today			0
i wanted to go from the word go			0
