hunched over a crystal ashtray , this is @entity3 dictator @entity2 pictured for the first time aboard his 174ft private jet			1
the @entity6 @entity7 , dubbed @entity8 , follows a design which became the world 's largest jet airliner when it first flew in 1963 but now sells for as little as £ 65,000			1
instead of 200 passengers it carries just the autocrat and his trusted aides in a style compared in scale to the @entity19 jet @entity20			0
a fully - equipped @entity6 @entity7 would be capable of seating 200 people enjoying the view : the leader was on a tightly - controlled flight to view blocks of university apartments released by the state - run @entity33 , these photos showed the dictator examining half - built apartment blocks on the eve of the anniversary of his father 's birth			1
he later toured the ' @entity41 ' on foot , using a pointing stick handed to him by a military underling so he could touch parts of the artist 's impression he could n't reach			0
the use of a private jet is a departure from the behaviour of @entity2 's father @entity53 , who had such a fear of flying that he visited @entity55 and @entity56 in a private armoured train			1
unveiled in 1962 with its first flight the following year , the @entity7 became commonly - used around the world and continued being manufactured until 1994			2
now - defunct nations including the @entity6 and @entity61 adapted the plane into a private jet before the fall of the @entity65			2
visit : these images of the plane were revealed yesterday by the state - run @entity33 , and claim to show new apartments being built on the banks of @entity71 's wide @entity70 comparison : given its size and the insignia on its tail , the jet has been compared to @entity20 the ageing model continued to be used widely including by the @entity56 airline @entity78 until 2008 , when its prominence began to fade as the carrier struggled in the global recession			1
now second - hand versions can be bought for a fraction of the price of a @entity87 garage because of the airliner 's age and high running costs			0
one 1990 - built @entity7 - 62 with its original long - haul seating arrangement is being sold for $ 100,000 ( £ 65,000 ) by a seller in @entity93 , @entity94			1
others are more expensive , including one 1984 - built @entity7 - 62 which is on sale for $ 1million ( £ 650,000 ) in @entity97			0
the existence of @entity2 's private plane emerged last may , when state officials released photos of him disembarking onto a gigantic red carpet with his wife @entity106			2
looking at things : the @entity3 dictator studied an artist 's impresion of the new apartment blocks tour : the images were released a day before state officials marked the anniversary of @entity53 's birth the @entity3 ruler was accused of hypocrisy considering his contempt for @entity121 indulgence , and @entity19 president @entity122			1
his nation is also accused by campaigners , charities and global governments of grievous human rights abuses			0
it was even claimed that the leader enjoys trying his hand at the controls of the plane , though it is not known if he has qualifications as a pilot			0
' @entity2 likes steering aircraft , ' a senior government source in @entity136 was quoted as saying in the @entity139 's capital , @entity136			0
the new images were released yesterday ahead of the anniversary of @entity53 's birth on february 16 , 1941			1
memorial : party officials met on the anniversary of the late dictator 's birth to pledge their allegiance paying his respects : the autocrat at a memorial event today flanked by top brass at @entity151 the country marked the occasion with massive fireworks , the promotion of top generals and a rally by top officials to vow loyalty to his son @entity2			1
flanked by military top brass , the ruler paid respects to his late father today in a mass ceremony at @entity71 's @entity151			2
according to @entity33 , the skyscrapers he viewed on the banks of @entity71 's @entity70 will be lived in by scientists at the @entity171			0
run nearby in the secretive nation 's capital , the university is named after a @entity3 general who fought @entity177 occupation alongside @entity2 's grandfather @entity178			2
the original @entity2 took power in 1948 and led the country for almost 50 years , creating a personality cult which means he is still @entity3 's ' eternal president ' despite dying in 1994			0
his son @entity53 ruled from 1994 until his death in 2011 when he handed the reins to @entity2 , whose aggressive stance set off new diplomatic ripples between @entity3 and the @entity187			0
red carpet treatment : these images released last may drew the attention of the world to @entity2 's private jet scale : the secretive nation has long since built up a cult of personality around the @entity2 dynasty even bigger : the @entity19 president 's @entity20 has two galley kitchens , a surgeon and an operating theatre			1

@entity2 uses 174ft @entity6 @entity7 with *560mph* top speed
it was world 's largest jet airliner in 1963 but can now sell for just £ 65,000
fully *decked* - out models can carry 200 people - but @entity2 's is for him
he flew with @entity214 chiefs to view new apartment *towers* in @entity71
visit came on eve of 74th anniversary of his father @entity53 's birth
