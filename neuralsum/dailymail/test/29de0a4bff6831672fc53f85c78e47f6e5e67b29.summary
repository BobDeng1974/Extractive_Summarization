ever wondered if your personality was decided at birth ? it turns out , the order in which you were born can not only have an effect on your personality , but also your chances of academic success			1
according to @entity14 duo @entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity11 , who present an online science show , several theories suggest that where you are in your family determines who you are			1
the @entity22 are a strong example of a large celebrity family where the siblings share very different personality traits on @entity29 on @entity30 , the pair discuss how being the first , middle , youngest , or an only child affects us			1
the personality traits are also supposedly affected by whether parents have high expectations and how strict they were			1
first - @entity36 according to @entity9 and @entity10 , first - born children are expected to be higher academic achievers and more ambitious			1
they also have a stronger sense of responsibility and are generally more mature			0
( pictured from left to right ) @entity41 and @entity42 are famous first - borns			1
oldest children tend be ambitious and have strong leadership skills they also tend to have better leadership skills than other birth orders			1
the explanation is because although they get a lot more affection and attention from their parents , their parents have higher expectations as the first child			1
this works as a self - fulfilling prophecy : if there are high expectations placed on you , you are more likely to want to work hard and live up to these expectations			2
( pictured from left to right ) @entity21 and @entity63 are famous middle - borns			0
middle children tend to be co-operative and are more likely to be social butterflies middle - @entity36 middle - born children apparently tend to be more co-operative , flexible and sociable			2
they are also the birth order that are able to make and maintain friendships easily			0
this is due to the fact that as a middle - born child , there are n't the high expectations of the first child , nor the relaxed attitude accorded to the last child			2
as a result , they also tend to be less ambitious than their older brothers and sisters , and so will have a more relaxed attitude in life			0
as middle children receive less attention than their other siblings , they seek out relationships and friendships outside of their family , and can be social butterflies			2
( pictured from left to right ) @entity91 and @entity92 are famous youngest children			2
last - borns tend to be charming and confident last - @entity36 the video highlights how youngest children tend to be likeable and charming			2
other traits they carry are that they are more creative than older siblings , and have a stronger sense of security and confidence			2
as their parents have already had other children , they tend to be a lot less strict and are a lot more lenient with their youngest children			1
parents ' expectations will also be lower			1
as a result , youngest children will generally be less responsible and mature than older siblings , as they constantly feel like others will take the lead			0
( pictured from left to right ) @entity114 and @entity115 are famous only - children			0
only children tend to be creative and responsible @entity118 only children tend to be academically - able , creative and resourceful			0
they are also mature and responsible , and dislike disorder and like to be in control			0
being a parent 's only child , expectations are always high , but unlike a first - born , they never need to fight for the attention of their parents			1
not to mention , being in a household with only adults often leads the child to mature more quickly and copy the actions of the parents , rather than being moulded by siblings ' childish or youthful interests			0
but because they have never had to interact with siblings or companions of a similar age , they can have trouble relating to peers and can feel out of control when things in their life do n't go their way			0
the presenters of the video highlight that these are just theories relating to order of birth			0
they add that gender , social status , age gaps between siblings and the number of siblings can play a huge role in determining traits			0
@entity9 and @entity10 reiterate : ' some aspects may be true for you , or make a lot of sense , but it would n’t be the same for every single person around the world in your specific birth order			1
' it ’s important to remember that your personality and your destiny in life is not predetermined at birth			0
