by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:51 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 09:21 est , 2 april 2013 @entity4 ’s hopes of becoming prime minister will be fatally undermined unless he makes big gains in next month ’s local elections , senior @entity2 have warned			1
the @entity9 leader who has boasted of being a @entity11 politician is challenged to make gains of at least 1,000 council seats on may 2 , including proving he can win in the south of @entity16			1
a confident @entity18 cabinet minister declared : ‘ bring it on			0
’ almost 2,400 seats in will be contested in 35 areas , mostly council councils where @entity2 and @entity23 will be pitted against each other in head - to - head fights which could threaten coalition harmony			1
the @entity2 swept the board in 2009 , turning the electoral map almost entirely blue			0
four years on they are under pressure from @entity9 , the @entity23 and @entity31 @entity30 however , the @entity2 are determined to cast the vote as major test of mr @entity4 ’s ability to win outside @entity9 ’s northern comfort zone			1
conservative strategists point out that in 2009 the @entity2 were as far ahead in the polls as @entity9 are now			1
in 2009 , the @entity2 won 35 per cent of the vote with @entity9 under @entity38 13 points behind on just 22 per cent , pushed into third behind the @entity23			1
today opinion polls put @entity9 up to 10 points ahead of the @entity2			2
according to @entity18 analysis , on a straight poll swing labour would expected to win 1,500 seats			0
a senior source said : ‘ they wo n’t get that but anything other than 1,000 @entity9 gains will raised big questions for @entity4			1
‘ he said they are the @entity11 – in which case he they have to be able to operate in the south and the south east			0
‘ two years from now he is expecting to be walking into @entity57 and he can not do that without living in the south			0
these local elections are the biggest test to show he can lead a @entity11			2
’ @entity9 hopes to build on gains made in local elections since @entity4 became leader , but the party has made little progress in the south of @entity16 mr @entity4 has adopted the @entity11 slogan but failed to make breakthroughs in the south of @entity16 however , in the early skirmishes of expectation management , @entity9 today sought to play down the idea of making big gains			1
' we think 200 seats would be a good result for us , ' said a source close to mr @entity4			1
aides highlight that just nine of the 35 councils being contested on may 2 have ever been @entity9 controlled			2
and in areas where the party once dominated it suffered catastrophic losses in 2009 , including losing 28 of 44 seats in @entity85 and 29 or 32 seats in @entity87			0
other councils where @entity9 is expected to make strong gains are all in the north of @entity16 , including @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			0
the source added : ' we did so badly at the last election that there is a significant mountain to climb			0
' however , @entity2 are braced for hundreds of losses after gaining control of seven councils and 244 seats in 2009			2
just a year before the general election which forced mr @entity38 out of power , @entity9 lost of four councils and 291 seats			0
the @entity108 gained eight seats in net terms while the @entity31 @entity30 made a net gain of seven seats			2
after being humiliated by the @entity31 @entity30 in the @entity113 by - election , the @entity2 will seek to portray @entity30 as being allies of @entity9 , warning a vote for any party other than @entity18 will lead to council tax rises			1
write caption here voters will be told that backing @entity30 will allow @entity9 to gain control of councils and drive up bills			1
‘ if you want to put up your council tax , vote @entity30 or @entity9 , ’ will be a key message			2
tories admit the elections will be ‘ tough ’ after securing a ‘ once - in - a - generation high ' in 2009			1
@entity31 @entity30 leader @entity128 today began a @entity130 tour to woo disaffected voters ahead of may 's elections the @entity23 are confident of making gains against the @entity2 in the south , even hoping to regain @entity135			1
‘ taking them will be a bit of a stretch , ’ said a senior @entity23 source			0
‘ but they are not out of reach			0
‘ the @entity142 is where we feel strongest in our battles against the @entity2			0
’ three - quarters of seats the @entity23 are contesting are straight fights against the conservatives			2
@entity30 leader @entity128 today started a two - week @entity152 tour of market towns and cities where he hopes to make gains in the local elections			1
it kicked off in the @entity142 , where @entity30 has traditionally been strongest , taking in @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 in @entity161 and @entity162 in @entity163			1
@entity30 will focus on local democracy , energy policy , wind farms and planning to widen its appeal beyond its anti-brussels message			0
the party currently has around 50 councillors at all levels of local government			0
the party is fielding record numbers of candidates , and hopes to more than double its share of the vote from the five per cent it won in 2009			0
a @entity30 insider said : ‘ i would be disappointed if we are not on 13 per cent			0

tories say @entity9 must gain 1,000 seats to prove they are on the up
but @entity9 claims winning just 200 extra seats would be ' a good result '
tories admit elections on may 2 will be ' tough ' but say @entity4 faces bigger test to show he can win outside his northern comfort zone
@entity23 hope to regain @entity163 and @entity159 in head - to - head battle with @entity2 which risk splitting the coalition
