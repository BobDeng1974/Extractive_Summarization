by @entity0 next time you 're struggling with the school run , spare a thought for the parents in this @entity7 village			1
after torrential rain , they have been forced to put their children in a raft through a raging river in order to get them to classes on time			1
students in @entity7 would not dream of letting anything as minor as a flash - flood put them off attending school for the all - important education they need to succeed in modern @entity7			1
so these pupils instead battle through the flood waters in the village of @entity25 in southern @entity7 's @entity26			1
water way to get to school : @entity7 pupils are forced to take a raft across a flooded river to make it to class between a raft and a hard place : the pupils were pictured battling through the flood waters of the river in the village of @entity25 in southern @entity7 's @entity26 after the flood , authorities bought the students life jackets to keep them safe when crossing the river , but said there is no money for the bridge parents want			1
only last week , pupils were photographed wading through another overflowing river in the remote @entity51 village in the same region of @entity7			1
one boy , six - year - old @entity53 , said : ' it was cold and i was a little bit afraid but it was ok in the end			0
i did it because i want to go to school			0
i can not afford to miss anything			0
' his mother @entity63 said : ' it has rained for over a month here and the roadway to the school was washed away long ago			0
' it is around 100 metres across and 22 primary school children , like my son , have to make the journey twice a day to get to classes			2
tough love : after the flood , authorities bought the students life jackets to keep them safe when crossing the river , but said there is no money for the bridge parents want ' quite slippery , but they 've got the hang of it ' : pupils were also photographed wading through another overflowing river in the remote @entity51 village in the same region of @entity7 ' if they did n't make this crossing here , they would have to walk for three miles and then still get wet			1
' here they can walk on the top of an old dam			0
it is quite slippery but they have got the hang of it			0
' they all look out for one another and are very cautious			0
no - one has yet been swept away			0
we instil the need for safety in all of them			0
' local water authority official @entity104 said : ' there is not enough money to build a bridge yet , but we hope to in the near future			1
' it is not ideal for children to have to go through this twice a day , but there is no alternative at present			2
not so much a school run as a treacherous walk : parents carry their children across a swollen river ' at the moment , they can walk across the dam top but sometimes it gets so flooded that only a raft is operable			2
' still , from what i have heard of western children , our ones are a lot tougher and willing to put up with much more to get to classes on time			2
' @entity7 is included in international education tests held every three years by the @entity132 , measure pupils ' skills in reading , numeracy and science			1
these @entity139 tests - the @entity139 - have become the leading international benchmark and show @entity7 has an education system that is overtaking most western countries			2
the @entity139 2009 tests even showed that @entity144 was top of the international education rankings .			0

even flash floods wo n't stop @entity7 children making it to class on time
authorities have bought them life jackets , but said no money for bridge
pupils in another village forced to wade *perilously* through flood waters
