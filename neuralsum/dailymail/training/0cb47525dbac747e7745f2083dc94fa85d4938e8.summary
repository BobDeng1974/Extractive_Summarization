many would say it was a health hazard that causes crippling breathing problems not to mention a serious vitamin d deficiency			0
but @entity4 's naval chief has found a rather more positive side to the country 's awful pollution			0
the smog , he says , provides an effective barrier against the emerging threat of laser weaponry			1
scroll down for @entity12 @entity4 ¿ s 20 years of rapid growth has seen harmful toxins spewed relentlessly from coal burning factories and millions of cars ¿ 1500 new vehicles drive onto @entity19 s gridlocked roads every day cars can barely be seen through the smog as they drive along a road in @entity23 after a hazardous blanket enveloped the city @entity27 weaponry : a high - speed camera captures the first full - energy shots from an electromagnetic launcher which the @entity31 plans to deploy on one of its ships this year @entity36 rear admiral @entity35 , a military expert at the @entity37 , spoke days after it was reported that the @entity31 planned to deploy its first laser weapon aboard one of its ships in the @entity43			1
he said lasers were ' most afraid of smog ' because it severely hampers the distance it can be fired			1
' under conditions where there is no smog , a laser weapon can fire ( at a range of ) 10 kilometres , ' he told @entity55 ’s @entity54 ( cross-straits ) current affairs program , according to www.news.com.au			1
' when there ’s smog , it ’s only one kilometre			2
what 's the point of making this kind of weapon ? ' new threat : a laser weapon aboard the destroyer @entity68 in @entity69 in this picture from 2012 @entity4 rear admiral @entity35 said lasers were ' most afraid of smog ' because it severely hampers the distance it can be fired admiral @entity35 explained that smog is made up of tiny metallic particles which make it harder for the lasers to penetrate			1
the smog in @entity23 is now so thick that it is blocking sunlight despite recent announced closures or production cuts at 147 of the city 's industrial plants			2
yesterday , it was reported that a @entity4 man was suing the government for failing to halt air pollution after he was forced to buy a treadmill to exercise indoors			0
@entity92 , from @entity93 in @entity95 province , claims the authorities have failed to control the increasing smog , which has forced him to spend money on face masks and an air purifier as well as the treadmill			2
his lawsuit was filed as readings of @entity106 , a key measure of pollution , reached 444 micrograms per cubic meter in the capital of @entity23 , nearly 18 times the safe level			0
rail guns fire a projectile at seven times the speed of sound - enough velocity to cause severe damage the @entity31 plans to deploy its first laser on a ship later this year and it intends to test an electromagnetic rail gun prototype aboard a vessel within two years			1
both costs pennies on the dollar compared with missiles and smart bombs and the weapons can be fired continuously , unlike missiles and bombs , which eventually run out			0
' it fundamentally changes the way we fight , ' said captain @entity132 , program manager for directed energy and electric weapon systems for the @entity135			0
the @entity31 's laser technology has evolved to the point that a prototype to be deployed aboard the @entity139 this summer can be operated by a single sailor , he said			1
the solid - state laser weapon system is designed to target what the @entity31 describes as ' asymmetrical threats			1
' those include aerial drones , speed boats and swarm boats , all potential threats to warships in the @entity150 , where the @entity151 , a floating staging base , is set to be deployed			0
rail guns , which have been tested on land in @entity155 , fire a projectile at six or seven times the speed of sound — enough velocity to cause severe damage			0
the @entity31 sees them as replacing or supplementing old - school guns , firing lethal projectiles from long distances .			2

rear admiral @entity35 says lasers are ' most afraid of the smog '
he claims it cuts distance weapon can be fired from 10 kilometres to *1km*
@entity31 is ready to deploy laser *onboard* one of its ships later this year
