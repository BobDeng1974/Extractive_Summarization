by comparison , @entity5 ’s current @entity31 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity34 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			1
@entity36 's @entity35 is 7.9mm thick , while the @entity37 is 9.3mm			2
according to @entity39 , the new filter will replace the hybrid @entity41 filter used on the @entity31 with a resin lens filter manufactured by @entity44 company @entity43			2
recent rumours also claim there will be two models , one with a 4.7inch screen , and one with a 5.7inch screen			1
previous rumours have pointed to a super slim ' @entity23 ' model , which could be the smaller handset			0
the two new handsets are expected to be revealed at @entity5 's annual annual developer conference , held in @entity55 in june			1
it is where the firm traditionally makes new product announcements			0
concept images have emerged that show @entity5 's next - generation handset with a super-thin slender chassis			1
this concept , by @entity66 - based firm set solution , predicts the handset could be 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom , in order to retain the home button if announced , the handsets are expected to go on sale within weeks			1
@entity75 analyst @entity74 told @entity75 - language website qq tech that @entity5 will launch the follow up to its flagship smartphone in two large screen sizes			1
according to @entity79 , the @entity4 will come with a 4.7 - inch screen , with a display resolution of 1,136 by 640 pixels			0
the company would then launch a larger 5.7 - inch model shortly afterwards			0
@entity5 surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin @entity34 , and rumours suggest it could be working on making an equally slender version of its @entity4			1
by comparison , @entity5 's current @entity31 , pictured , has a depth of 7.6mm			1
this makes it 1.7mm thinner than the @entity93 and 1.37mm thinner than the @entity94 two concept images have emerged that show @entity5 ’s next - generation handset with a slender chassis , as well as a larger 5 - inch screen similar to those seen on the @entity35 and @entity37			1
the first concept predicts the phone - dubbed the ' @entity103 ' - will be 4.5mm thick , while the second goes a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom			0

in order to make the @entity5 phone super-thin , @entity117 ’s concept suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys			2
[ embed in order to make the @entity5 phone super-thin , @entity117 's concept - dubbed @entity103 - suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys and swipe controls @entity5 surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin @entity34 , pictured , which was 20 % thinner than previous models @entity132 ’s concept , instead , keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top			1
it also appears taller than @entity117 ’s version in order to fit the larger screen			0
@entity5 ’s @entity4 has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the @entity31 would be the first to break the 4 - inch mark - but it did n't			1
@entity5 ’s ceo @entity146 has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they ’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand			2
however , with main rivals @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity152 releasing phones with screens in the 5 - inch region , analysts claim @entity5 may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people			1
last november , designer @entity159 created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the @entity4 's screen size , without drastically increasing the size of the handset			0
in his image , the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges			0
however , because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident , when it ’s picked up for example , the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced			0
according to @entity178 journalist @entity177 : ' the only way i could see something that thin working for users , is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket			0
' he continued that if @entity5 was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest , which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis , it could also pave the way for foldable devices			2
