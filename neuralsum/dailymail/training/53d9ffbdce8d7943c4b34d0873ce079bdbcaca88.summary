by @entity0 a @entity2 student has made a series of painful conclusions in his research into stings by letting honey bees attack his own body			1
@entity9 subjected himself to several stings a day to his face , arms and genitals to map out what section of the body was most sensitive to the barbs			1
after weeks of research @entity9 found that although stings to his penis and testicles were uncomfortable , the worst place for a bee to attack was the nostril			1
science of stings : @entity2 student @entity9 researched the most painful places for a bee to attack his usual idea for the study came about when the bee enthusiast was discussing the problems of working with hives with his academic adviser			1
' we speculated it probably really would hurt to get stung in the testicles			2
two days later , by chance , i did get stung there			2
it did n't hurt as much as i expected it to , ' he told the @entity45			0
@entity9 measured the stings with a pain rating of 1 for mild and 10 for extremely painful : 1 ) nostril - 9.0 6 ) @entity49 - 7.0 2 ) @entity50 lip - 8.7 7 ) @entity51 - 6.7 3 ) penis - 7.3 8 ) nipple - 6.7 4 ) @entity53 - 7.0 9 ) middle finger tip - 6.7 5 ) @entity55 - 7.0 10 ) @entity56 - 6.7 intrigued by his ' eureka ' moment , @entity9 chose 25 locations on his body to measure the level of pain			1
he then held a bee to those areas and allowed it to sting him			0
like all scientific studies he needed to repeat his experiment several times so , over the course of 38 days , he administered five stings a day			2
each body part was stung three times during the experiment , and the pain level was given a mark out of 10			1
because the experiment needed a control , he also had to let a bee sting his forearm at the start and end of each day 's research			0
his research raised some unusual problems , including being able to maneuver a bee to the more hard - to - reach body parts			2
' some locations required the use of a mirror and an erect posture during stinging ( e.g. , buttocks ) , ' he wrote in his study , which has been published in @entity90			0
the results were surprising , with @entity9 finding that although stings to the genitals were painful , there were worst places to be stung			1
' there ’s definitely no crossing of wires of pleasure and pain down there			2
but if you ’re stung in the nose and penis , you ’re going to want more stings to the penis over the nose , if you ’re forced to choose , ' he told @entity108			0
experiment : @entity9 held bees to his body so he could research the most painful sites for stings pain map : to be sure of his results , @entity9 administered three bee stings to 25 locations on his body ' i really do n't want to get sting in the nose again – that 's not fun			1
you 're sneezing , wheezing			0
your eyes are streaming , ' he added			0
@entity9 admitted that there were times when he regretted embarking on his experiment , and said he was glad his supervisor , @entity130 , had talked him out of testing stings to the eyes			1
' he was concerned that i might go blind			0
i wanted to keep my eyes , ' @entity9 said			1
the graduate 's fascination with bees has formed the basis of his research at @entity2 's @entity140 , where he is studying honeybee colonies			1
while studying molecular biology at @entity143 in 2009 he founded the @entity144 , which has led to the creation of two hives on the university campus			0
he also runs the @entity149 group , which advises students on how to get hives up and running			0
dedication : @entity9 , a graduate student researching hive colonies , also promotes beekeeping at universities while measuring pain is subjective , and the study used only one person 's measure of pain , @entity9 has no plans to further his research into bee stings			1
' i did n’t see a lot of merit in repeating this with more subjects , ' he said			0
and for those wanting to avoid accidentally repeating his experiment , @entity9 advised : ' if you have a bee buzzing around you and you think it 's peeved , if you calm down , do n't breathe a lot – they are attracted to carbon dioxide – and slowly walk away , you will be fine			2
most stings are probably wasps			0

each body part was stung 3 times to measure level of pain
@entity2 graduate student @entity9 used results to show most sensitive sites to be stung
