by @entity0 hormone therapy can be medically legitimate , but it can also be used by those wishing to look younger ' anti-ageing ' hormones could in fact shorten your life expectancy			1
new research suggests higher levels of hormones can reduce the effect of the body 's natural defences against diseases			1
the study by scientists at @entity17 in @entity18 found that those in their 90s with naturally low levels of the hormone had a much better chance of living into their 100s than those with above - average levels			1
anti-ageing hormones are a billion dollar industry based on the theory that replenishing hormones , which disappear naturally as you grow older , will restore youth			1
the hormones that are administered are mostly human growth hormone ( @entity36 ) which makes the body develop another hormone called insulin - like growth factor ( @entity40 - 1 ) , and dehydroepiandrostersone ( @entity41 )			2
previous studies have found that using @entity36 , estrogen and other hormones has dangerous side effects like cancer , joint problems and cardiovascular disease			1
but the @entity50 study found that low @entity40 levels might actually be a benefit and a way of predicting if someone is going to live for longer			1
the study examined 184 men in their mid- 90s over the period of 11 years and found that the chance of living through the length of the study depended on their blood levels of @entity40			2
human growth hormone ( pictured ) can be used to stimulate growth in certain areas of the body , strengthening bone and increasing muscle - hence its cosmetic uses it found a one nanogram per millimetre decrease in @entity40 meant the person was going to live a week longer			1
in addition , scientists also found people with lower @entity40 levels who were cancer survivors benefited more from the lower levels found in their blood			2
three years into the study , 75 per cent of people who previous had cancer and low @entity40 levels were still living , whereas only 25 per cent of participants with past cancer and higher @entity40 were alive			0
dr. @entity86 , lead author of the study , said : ' in light of insufficient scientific evidence [ that ] hgh in older adults offers long - term anti-aging benefits , and with studies indicating that low growth hormone levels may actually protect the elderly from ageing diseases the risks of using @entity36 as an anti-aging strategy outweigh the potential benefits			0
' growth hormones began as an industry in 1990 , in @entity101 , when 12 men over 60 were given injections			0
the men found their muscle mass increased , their bone density grew and they had a decline in body fat			2
@entity109 quickly took on the study and repackaged it as ' anti-ageing ' and began offering it as a service			2
administering hgh is illegal unless a patient has low levels of the hormone ; but this diagnosis is subjective , which means some clinics can prescribe the treatment to those who do n't need it			0
the research was carried out by the same group that found that many people over 100 have a mutation that keeps their @entity40 levels below average			0
another study in the journal @entity131 said the benefits incurred from a lower level of @entity40 could also extend to people in middle age , finding that people between the ages of 50 and 65 with a high animal protein consumption had high @entity40 levels and were four times more likely to develop cancer			0
they were also 75 per cent more likely to die over the study period of 18 years			0
dr @entity86 told @entity145 : ' growth hormone administration causes '' melting '' of fat and tightening of skin , so one may look better			0
' it may be beneficial for maintaining a @entity153 kind of longevity but would not serve the public good , in general , as an anti-aging strategy			0
' but the relationship between @entity36 , @entity40 - 1 and life expectancy is very complex , and low @entity40 could be seen as a double - edged sword , as some studies have said low @entity40 is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems .			1

@entity164 in @entity18 carried out study
they found ' anti-ageing ' hormones may decrease life expectancy
the hormones are often used for cosmetic reasons and to look younger
scientists found they may increase risk of disease and cut body 's defences
