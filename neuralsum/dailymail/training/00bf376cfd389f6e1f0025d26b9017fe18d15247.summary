by @entity1 reporter it 's 11pm , do you know where your children are ? if you 're a @entity7 , @entity6 parent , you may want to check @entity8			0
a new account with the handle @ @entity11 is causing outrage in @entity14 and @entity15 counties , with local teens snapping pictures of themselves at house parties which are then retweeted to the account 's more than 22,000 followers			1
unsurprisingly , the pictures are not the kind of images any parent wants to see of their children posted online			1
incriminating : a @entity8 account has been reposting pictures of @entity7 teens underage drinking wide reach : the teens take snaps of themselves underage drinking and then send them to the account which in turn retweets them to its more than 22,000 followers not suitable behavior : many @entity7 parents are concerned these pictures will get in the way of their children getting into college or getting a job ' kids do stupid things			1
we 've probably all done stupid things , now you 've got social media to be able to publish to the world how dumb you are forever , ' @entity46 parent @entity45 told @entity51			0
the images posted to the account run the gamut of a fairly innocuous shot of two girls shotgunning beers to students stripping down for no apparent reason			1
since teens have been underage drinking since the dawn of time , the resulting images are pretty unsurprising			2
recent posts include several students peeing in unconventional places like a sink or the corner of a dining room			0
drunk stories : some of the pictures are fairly innocuous , like the girls on the left shotgunning beers , or the picture on the right of two boys showing up to the party with a cheetah statue sick : but others are more concerning , like the several shots of high schoolers throwing up			2
this girl made it into a waste bin - many do not when you have to go , you have to go : many of the high - schoolers did n't have the patience to wait for an empty bathroom when the teens have had too much to drink , they usually end up either throwing up ( both successfully making it into the toilet , and many times not ) , or passing out			2
if they make the mistake to fall asleep before everyone else does , they are usually subjected to such pranks as being surrounded by beer bottles or drawn upon			0
in addition to concerns about the teens ' health , local parents also think these pictures may come back to haunt their children when they apply for colleges or a job			1
tired : when the teens have had too much to drink , they usually pass out before finding a bed do n't move ! this teen is in for a surprise when he awakes from his drunken nap should n't have gone to sleep : the girl who passed out in this photo had crude images scrawled on her face and arm including the phrase ' this is what friends are for ' @entity127 works for @entity128 , a nonprofit organization that educates teens abou the dangers of drinking and driving			0
' once it ’s out in cyberspace there ’s no taking it back , ' @entity133 told @entity51			0
' if an employer is going to be looking for someone to represent their company you ’re not going to want somebody that ’s been all over the web			0
' authorities in @entity15 say they know about the @entity8 account , but it will only be used as part of a larger investigation if someone files a complaint			1
and it does n't look like the @entity8 account is going anywhere			0
after media coverage of the account this week , the administrator tweeted : ' the news was trying to get people to unfollow @ @entity11 all they did was help spread the word			1

parents are concerned about the incriminating party pictures being posted on @ @entity11
local teens have been sending in pictures taken at underage parties and the account retweets the snaps to its more than 22,000 followers
local *police* say they know about the account , but will only use it as part of a larger investigation if someone fills out a complaint
