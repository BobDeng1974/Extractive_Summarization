two superheroes have been caught on camera racing each other in a high - speed showdown on water			1
in perhaps a preview of what fans can expect from the 2016 blockbuster @entity9 v @entity8 : @entity12 , the two caped crusaders were filmed trying to one - up each other in a barefoot water ski competition			2
the humorous video in fact stars members of the @entity18 and was created by 19 - year - old @entity19 , of @entity20			1
it 's a bird ... it 's a plane : superman shows off his flying moves on water in a new video on @entity26 battle it out : he faces off with @entity9 as the pair attempt outdo each other in barefoot water skiing skills filmed at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 , in october , the talented sportsmen battled windy conditions to perform a series of stunts			1
' glass - like water and zero wind is what is required for a good performance , ' @entity19 tells @entity43			1
' the day that we did the shoot , we got up at six o'clock in the morning and it was pouring with rain and howling a gale			0
' despite the poor weather , the skiers filmed continuously for ' four to five hours ' to get the perfect shot			2
speed demon : the superheroes are actually members of the @entity18 team caped crusader : the sport involves skiing at speeds of up to 40mph barefoot while performing tricks the superheroes attempted to outmanoeuvre each other as they show off one - handed , no hands and backwards moves while skiing at speeds of up to 40mph			1
@entity18 was formed in 1971 and its handful of members include three championship winners , @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity70 ( who appears in the film as @entity8 )			1
the video has amassed over a thousand views since it was uploaded to @entity26 four days ago			2
the idea came to @entity76 ( who confesses to being more of a @entity9 fan ) after he watched @entity80			0
he says : ' i wondered , how could i make someone fly like @entity8 without a multi-million pound budget ? can fans expect some barefoot action on film ? @entity88 and @entity89 star in the 2016 blockbuster ' this is when i stumbled upon barefoot waterskiing , which was new to me			0
these two ideas coupled together could make for a really good video and it had never been done before			0
' @entity19 is currently studying @entity96 at @entity97 , and has been working on his @entity99 editing @entity26 channel in his spare time for a few years			2
his aim is to turn the hobby into a career			0
' it 's my true passion , ' he says			0
his editing skills have already landed the budding filmmaker several opportunities , like travelling to @entity108 to film the @entity109 , and to @entity110 to capture wildlife .			0
