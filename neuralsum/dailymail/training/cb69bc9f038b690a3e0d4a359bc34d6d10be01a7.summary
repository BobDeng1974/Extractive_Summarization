by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is in serious danger of becoming the second most famous celebrity @entity6 fan in the @entity7			1
surpassing frequent visitor , and thorn in their side , @entity11 , but failing to crack the number one slot , currently held by the president of their country			0
so fair enough , i suppose			0
@entity2 has pulled off an amazing coup and joined the ranks of @entity7 @entity21 hosts			1
in the recent game of musical frontman chairs , @entity22 gave up his on the @entity25 , and young @entity2 is now set to nestle his rear into place instead			1
there ’s no doubt his celebrated stint on @entity30 in ‘ @entity31 , two @entity33 ’ helped his cause			0
but it is surely his work from behind a desk at @entity37 that has really sealed the deal			1
@entity39 is currently in its eighth series , and a jewel in the channel ’s crown			1
what ’s more , it has gone through a few changes over the years , but now really seems to have hit pay dirt with its team spirit , wacky antics ( and less pre-recorded set pieces ) , and general sense of joie de vivre			2
which when you read it , sounds like it might actually be pretty annoying			0
but in practice , is genuinely a good , knockabout hour of fun			0
with some sport attached ! @entity60 took to @entity37 show @entity39 with gusto , even when hoisted in mid-air @entity64 and @entity65 take each other on in a @entity68 challenge as part of the show one thing that certainly gets the telly magic happening is quite how much @entity2 clearly enjoys the company of his two team captains - @entity64 , and our very own @entity65			1
@entity64 , of course , has @entity76 alongside him			1
which you ’d think would be completely chalk and cheese as a partnership			0
but actually works more like cheese and onion			0
and in the green packet			0
and where these two happily gad about and take it over-the - top , @entity65 ’s is a more subtle impact			1
but nonetheless effective for it			0
first of all , he ’s charm itself			0
when @entity2 asked him what he did to prepare for a new series , he drolly replied ‘ i do a few comedy clubs ’			1
@entity96 may not go in for the thigh slappers , but he ’s got a great little comic touch on him			0
then he is also clearly popular with co-stars			0
this manifested itself perfectly on one of the physical rounds , when he and @entity64 went head to head in a game of @entity108			1
or as @entity65 decided to play it , spitting sushi into a bucket			1
in amongst the massive mouthfuls and looks of genuine disgust , our man could be heard continually muttering what could be his new , well , first catchphrase - ‘ i do n’t like it ’			0
@entity60 lubes up comedian @entity119 before launching him into foam bowling pins			1
as you do @entity65 and @entity60 give it some welly as they thrust @entity119 towards the foam bowling pins @entity2 , cracking up , said he sounded like his 3 year old son ‘ at every meal time ’			1
and i ca n’t wait to hear him punditing on his next live @entity37 match when @entity130 asks him what he thinks of the game			1
please @entity65 , tell him ‘ i do n’t like it ’			1
however , the gracious fella that he is , i ’m sure he ’d agree he was n’t the star of this particular show			2
that title surely belonged to the sporting legend for this episode , @entity60			1
@entity39 is never short of big names willing to muck in , and be at the butt end of the jokes in the process			2
but the little grey - haired fella in the nice crew neck jumper did what he often used to on the pitch , and turned the tables in his favour			0
the great @entity151 rant was shown right at the start of the show			0
and @entity2 exercised his mad @entity130 skillz playing ‘ samples ’ of it throughout			2
the @entity158 barnets from across the years were also subject to great scrutiny			0
as was most of the rest of him in an old photo on the beach , in the flimsiest pair of official @entity165 issue trunks			0
@entity60 sang his heart out , much to the enjoyment of team captains @entity65 and @entity119 the former @entity165 boss gets the audience going as he closes the show with an encore of his single which got a good laugh			1
but when @entity60 explained that if you ’d trained as hard as they ’d made at his club in @entity181 , @entity182 , ‘ you would have a physique like that ’			2
before turning to @entity2 and saying , ‘ well , you would n’t ! ’			2
so happy were @entity64 and @entity76 with this , they had to run across the studio to high five him ! but that was n’t the best of it			2
always finish on a song is a good old showbiz adage			0
and it was @entity60 ’s hit from the late seventies that ultimately brought the house down			2
an old clip of him performing ‘ @entity199 ’ on a telly show certainly got the audience going			0
but once @entity65 decided to recreate the moment we ’d just seen , and had @entity60 sing while sitting on his knee , it got positively anthemic			1
arms were raised overhead , and clapping along occurred as @entity60 went for it , a capella			2
it was a fantastic , spontaneous moment and the kind of thing that has kept this series fresh across the years			0
@entity2 may indeed have a great career as a @entity7 talk show host , but he might never have quite as much fun			1
to paraphrase @entity65 , ‘ i like it ’			2
video : watch @entity64 in action during @entity39			1

' @entity39 ' is now in its eighth series on @entity37
@entity2 , host of the show , is a particular *success*
this week saw @entity226 manager @entity60 take part
@entity65 and @entity64 are team captains with a *difference*
