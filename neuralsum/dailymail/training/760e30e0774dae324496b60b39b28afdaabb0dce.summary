@entity0 opted for @entity2 treatment to have a child when she could n't find a suitable father midwife @entity0 always dreamed of having a baby of her own			1
as a young woman she was sure she would find ' the one ' before she was ready to become a mother			0
but life had other plans and following an eight year marriage , a divorce , and several years of dating she found herself alone , childless and very broody at 34			0
while investigating her options she discovered that she had some major fertility issues and that time was running out			1
today , after undergoing three rounds of @entity2 , @entity0 is a single mother to six - month - old @entity16 , and she could n't be more delighted			1
interviewed on this morning today @entity0 told hosts @entity18 and @entity20 : ' i remember from the age of 24 thinking : " this is it , i am ready as a woman , " ' i was married for eight years but i knew he was n't the right one to have children with and always assumed that i would meet somebody else after we got divorced			1
' ' at the age of 34 i decided to start looking into donor insemination			0
i was n't interested in @entity2 , and did n't think i would need it			2
' i did n't know then that there was a problem with my fertility and still thought that i might meet somebody , i was only 34			0
' unfortunately @entity0 did n't meet anybody and with her biological clock ticking she decided to have a private fertility test to take stock of her options			2
she was diagnosed with a @entity41 ( @entity41 ) problem and doctors at the clinic confirmed that time was running out			2
@entity0 said : ' i remember hearing the words " you have n't got a day to waste			2
" ' my blood ran cold and i realised that this might not happen			0
' @entity0 found an @entity50 sperm donor and discovered that she was pregnant on christmas eve 2012 following three rounds of @entity2			1

' dr @entity57 , a @entity58 fertility specialist appearing on the show with @entity0 added : ' most women want to have a natural baby			1

' there has been a change in society and women today want to have choices '			0
@entity0 says : ' you have to be in the right frame of mind			2
if you think you can do it , which i did , then go for it			0
you wo n't regret it , and you do n't want to go through life thinking " what if ? " ' @entity0 appeared on this morning with @entity58 fertility expert dr @entity57 ' the 2004 guideline recommends that couples in which the woman is aged 23 - 39 years at the time of treatment and who have an identified cause for their fertility problems or who have infertility of at least three years ' duration should be offered up to three stimulated cycles of @entity2 treatment			1
the new guidance [ may 2012 ] recommends that in women aged 40 to 42 years who have not had @entity2 treatment , consider one full cycle of @entity2 , with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection , where there is no chance of pregnancy with expectant management ( ' absolute infertility ' ) and where @entity2 is the only effective treatment			1
@entity109 also recommends that unstimulated intrauterine insemination should be considered as a treatment option for people who are unable to , or would find it very difficult to have vaginal intercourse because of a physical disability or psychosexual diagnosis who are using partner or donor sperm , people with conditions that require specific consideration in relation to methods of conception , and people who are in same - sex relationships			1
@entity129 treatments have improved significantly since the original guideline was published , and the updated draft guideline recommends that the transmission of @entity129 to the female partner is negligible through unprotected sexual intercourse when certain criteria are met			0

single women now make up *2.3* *%* of those having @entity2 treatment
experts put it down to women taking more *responsibility* for their fertility
