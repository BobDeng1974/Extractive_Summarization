no relief in sight : energy secretary @entity2 said yesterday that he believes the @entity4 public will face further price rises in the future fuel prices will continue to soar , the energy secretary said yesterday – as he ruled out moves to cut punishing green taxes			1
@entity11 said there was no respite in sight for hard - pressed families struggling to pay their fuel bills , adding : ‘ i think we will see more price rises			1
’ the @entity19 minister said @entity4 was on the verge of agreeing a £ 50billion @entity22 and @entity23 investment in new nuclear power , which is expected to drive bills even higher			1
and he indicated the @entity19 will try to block any attempt by @entity27 to reduce so - called green taxes			0
@entity29 confirmed last week that the prime minister has ordered a review into whether some green taxes could be watered down , delayed or scrapped altogether in a bid to ease the misery caused by soaring fuel bills			2
the @entity37 ’s own figures suggest these levies already add £ 132.20 a year to the average bill			2
this figure is set to rise to £ 270.30 by 2020 as the drive for green energy is stepped up			1
but the @entity19 have vowed to block any reduction in green taxes , arguing they are needed to support the development of wind farms and pay for the homes of the poor to be insulated			0
the @entity50 rift means significant progress is unlikely before the election in 2015 , when the @entity53 could pledge to reduce bills by cutting environmental levies			2
power company @entity56 sparked fury last week by announcing plans to increase bills by 8.2 per cent this winter , partly because of green taxes			2
but mr @entity11 – who described @entity62 ’s plan to freeze energy bills as a ‘ con ’ – told the @entity66 ’s @entity65 that further price rises were inevitable			1
‘ i think we will see more price rises , ’ he said			0
‘ one of the reasons why we ’re seeing big energy price rises is the cost of wholesale gas on international markets			1
now neither i , you or @entity77 can do anything about that			0
‘ we have also seen a big increase in the network costs because we have got to replace ageing network			0
these are costs which are impossible to avoid			0
’ mr @entity11 claimed green levies could play a crucial role in reducing energy bills in the long term , adding : ‘ people have got to understand what these green taxes actually are			1
‘ most of them are actually social policies to help the fuel poor … so i do n’t think we want to get rid of those do we ? ’ he said direct subsidies to wind farms and other forms of renewable energy added only 4 per cent to bills			2
he said the payments were ‘ absolutely ’ good value for money , despite widespread criticism			0
campaigning : song writer sir @entity104 has been a vocal critic of windfarms and says it is wrong for ' rich twits ' to benefit from them at the expense of the average bill payer mr @entity11 said ministers were ‘ extremely close ’ to announcing a ‘ massive ’ deal to allow @entity22 and @entity23 to build new nuclear power stations in @entity4			1
he suggested that @entity114 and @entity115 could also play a significant role , despite the latter ’s problems in the wake of the @entity121 disaster			0
details of the deal are likely to be announced this week			0
@entity124 energy , which is owned by the @entity22 state , and @entity23 general nuclear will be in line for tens of billions of pounds in subsidies over the coming decades in return for building a new generation of nuclear reactors			0
mr @entity11 insisted there would be none of the hidden subsidies that have inflated the cost of nuclear power in the past			1
but the government is expected to guarantee nuclear investors a minimum price of £ 90 per megawatt hour – roughly double the current electricity price – for up to 35 years			0
the increased cost will be passed on through higher bills			2
the @entity37 admits that electricity prices are 15 per cent higher because of green levies and gas prices are 5 per cent higher .			1

@entity11 says he was on the verge of agreeing a £ 50billion investment in new nuclear power , which could drive bills even higher
but he blames bills increasing on the rise in the cost of wholesale gas on international markets
@entity160 levies are set to rise to £ 270.30 by 2020 as the drive for green energy is stepped up
