monday night saw the latest development in @entity2 's extraordinary career : the 14 - time major winner played caddie to @entity5 in a chipping contest with @entity7			1
the sight of @entity2 laughing and joking with @entity9 and @entity7 on @entity10 will stun those used to seeing the steely - eyed , sometimes surly and often foul - mouthed @entity2 who prowls golf courses			1
after @entity7 's recent wins at @entity14 and the @entity15 , the @entity16 and world no 1 is becoming a true rival to @entity2 as the biggest name in golf , and the two superstars joined funnyman @entity9 to promote @entity23 's new vapor irons			1
all smiles : @entity7 ( let ) and @entity2 ( right ) on @entity10 with @entity5 game on : @entity9 challenged @entity7 ro a chipping contest , with @entity27 playing caddie for the tv host one - nil : @entity9 and @entity7 share a joke after the first pane of glass is shattered aim of the game : the pair attempted to break images of each other painted onto glass game for a laugh : @entity2 sat out the competition but joined in the fun and cracked a few jokes @entity9 managed to convince the pair to engage in a game of ' facebreakers ' , in which the aim was to chip golf balls in order to smash glass windows stained with images of @entity9 and @entity7 's faces			1
the first to smash all the faces of their rival was the winner			0
woods , who has suffered a miserable year through injury , culminating in a miserable performance in missing the cut two weeks ago at @entity61 , sat out the competition			2
all of which was probably wise - who knows what @entity66 captain @entity65 would have made of @entity2 chipping the ball after the 38 - year - old pulled out of the @entity70 last week			1
instead , a beaming @entity27 played caddie for @entity9 , setting up balls for the tv host to chip			1
he even cracked a few good jokes : ' just getting the balls lined up for you , sir , ' he obsequiously told @entity9 , drawing a laugh from the audience			2
@entity9 could n't hide his delight at having arguably the greatest golfer in history as his caddie			2
but , as @entity7 took charge of the contest , @entity9 screamed : ' @entity2 , help me ! ' but the four - time major winner took the trophy			1
meanwhile , @entity2 revealed he pulled out of the @entity70 because he did not feel he could have won a point for the @entity66			1
woods withdrew himself from contention for the competition , which gets under way at @entity96 in @entity97 on september 23 , and has ruled himself out of any further action until december as he attempts to get to the root cause of persistent back problems			2
' physically , i could n't do it , ' @entity2 told @entity102 of his decision to inform @entity66 captain @entity65 he was unavailable			2
' i would n't be ready , and not being able to be there for my team - mates , the captain , assistant captain and everyone that 's involved in the event , i just would n't be ready and i just could n't help the team			0
' when your name is called you have to be able to go out there and get a point and i just did n't feel like i could be ready enough to get a point			0
year to remember : @entity7 won @entity14 in july ( left ) and the @entity15 in august ( right ) back problems : @entity2 has endured a miserable year as he battles to overcome serious injury ' with that being said it was time to shut it down , get stronger , get more explosive again and get back for next year			1
' the former world no 1 said he is working in the gym and does not plan to pick up a golf club for a month with nothing on his agenda until his own tournament , the @entity131 tournament at @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 , in the first week of december			0
' i 've got to be physically fit when i come back so i 'll be explosive again and stable , ' he said			0
' obviously this year was frustrating in that i did n't really feel that i gave myself much of a chance			0
' i first had that pain in my back and it would go away , and then it would come back , go away , come back , until eventually it never went away ... it got fixed , but i took that fall on no 2 at the ( @entity141 - @entity140 ) and i had n't done any agility training yet so my hip got misaligned and everything went into spasm again			0
' we got that all calmed down again but then i had to play			0
now i need to keep it calm , then strengthen it and then i 'll be back			0
that 's one of the reasons i 've shut it down			0
i 'll come back in december and be ready for next year			0
' @entity153 's surgery & @entity2 and @entity7 appear on @entity9			1
