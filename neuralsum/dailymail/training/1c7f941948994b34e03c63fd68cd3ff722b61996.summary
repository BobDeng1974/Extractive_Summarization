by @entity0 published : 16:39 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 16:39 est , 31 may 2013 @entity2 ’s refusal to block grotesque child abuse websites is matched by the refusal of ministers to intervene			1
but why is the government so strangely reluctant to tackle the internet search company ? @entity2 barely pays any tax and merrily snoops on @entity9 with its notorious @entity11 cars , so it is not as if ministers lack any provocation			1
close : there appears to be a number of links between internet giant @entity2 and the @entity19 government @entity2 has been allowed to carve itself a reputation as a big friendly giant of the corporate world , brimming with ethical compassion and coolness			1
gradually , the corporation ’s ruthless streak is being exposed , but actually confronting the internet mammoth seems to be the last thing on the minds of ministers			0
by stunning coincidence , the cosy links between @entity2 and the upper echelons of the @entity19 could scarcely be more entangled			2
on a beautiful summer ’s day at a society wedding in @entity37 last year , the nexus was all too clearly illustrated			0
@entity38 , accompanied by his wife @entity39 and their daughter @entity40 , was among the congregation clapping enthusiastically outside a pretty @entity44 church			2
working relationship : both prime minister @entity38 , left , and chancellor @entity46 , right , have held meetings with @entity2 executives the bride was @entity50 , 29 , a senior @entity2 executive with the brief of ‘ public policy ’			1
she was previously a political adviser to @entity54 when he was @entity55 in charge of internet regulation – so he was in attendance too , resplendent in his morning suit			0
the wedding guests quaffed champagne in the sunshine and congratulated proud father - of - the - bride @entity63 , 70 , who happens to be the president of mr @entity38 ’s local constituency association			1
he is also a pr adviser to the @entity19			0
but miss @entity50 is far from the most senior @entity2 executive to bask in the collective adulation of the @entity69			2
former employee : @entity71 , @entity2 's top global spinner , was a @entity72 aide and was director of communications for conservative leader @entity74			2
the pair are pictured together @entity71 , @entity2 ’s top global spinner , is a former no 10 aide and was @entity74 ’s director of communications when he was @entity77 leader			2
she is married to @entity78 , the t - shirt - wearing guru who is mr @entity38 ’s close friend and former director of strategy at @entity72			1
the power couple are regarded as key members of the @entity85 set of conservatives who propelled mr @entity38 to @entity88 , and at one stage @entity89 was known as their queen			1
meanwhile the prime minister is godfather to @entity89 ’s younger son , and mr @entity78 was godfather to @entity94 , the late eldest child of @entity38 and @entity39			1
the links do not end there , for @entity2 has been assiduous at forging close ties at every level of @entity69			2
it is not just a case of former government policy wonks exiting through @entity103 ’s ‘ revolving door ’ to @entity2 – it works the other way too			0
@entity105 was once @entity2 ’s pr chief for @entity107 affairs , but now she has bagged a job advising justice secretary @entity109			0
and nor is it just @entity19 politicians to whom @entity2 offers the bosom of friendship			0
@entity114 , the internet giant ’s head of public policy in the @entity9 , is a former media adviser to @entity117			0
and a lobbying veteran named @entity119 – a close friend of @entity120 and well - connected in @entity122 circles – has in recent years been @entity2 ’s @entity107 director of communications			0
@entity2 spends a fortune on political lobbying , and politicians from all parties lap up the @entity2 brand , delighted to be associated with its hip image			0
before becoming prime minister , mr @entity38 spoke to the annual @entity132 conference in 2006 and 2007			1
powerful : @entity2 boss @entity133 is a trusted member of @entity38 's council of business advisors since the 2010 election , mr @entity38 has met @entity2 executives three times , while chancellor @entity46 has held four meetings			1
culture minister @entity140 has met the firm ’s staff seven times , and universities minister @entity144 has held at least one meeting			0
the symbiotic relationship was on show again last year when the chancellor agreed to open @entity148 , a hi - tech centre in @entity150 for start - up technology firms			0
with @entity2 ’s chairman , @entity133 , a trusted member of mr @entity38 ’s council of business advisers , critics wonder if there is any chance the pm will take steps to rein in the internet giant .			1

both @entity38 and @entity46 have met with @entity2 executives
@entity2 boss @entity133 is a trusted business advisor to mr @entity38
