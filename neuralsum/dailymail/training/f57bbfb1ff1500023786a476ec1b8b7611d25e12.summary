by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity3 will leapfrog @entity4 to become @entity6 ’s largest economy by 2030 , economists predict			1
thanks to our decision not to join the euro , we will overtake @entity11 in less than five years to become the fifth - largest economy in the world			1
in a significant boost to @entity16 ’s austerity programme , the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) hailed the @entity3 as the second - best performing economy in the western world after the @entity20 – and said @entity11 was one of the worst			1
a vision of the future ? the predictions , right , could be good news for @entity16 if true			0
the @entity3 is set to beat @entity4 and @entity11 but lose out to @entity26 and @entity27 , remaining the sixth - largest world economy our strong currency , low taxes and the projected rise in our population – in contrast with some of our competitors – means our gdp will outstrip @entity11 by 2018 and @entity4 12 years later			1
but competition from emerging economies means @entity27 and @entity26 will overtake us by 2028 , pushing us to seventh in the world economic league table			1
by then , @entity11 will be only the 13th largest economy in the world – a humiliating blow to the proud nation and an indictment of current @entity48 president @entity47 ’s policies			1
unbeatable : we could not hope to rival @entity49 , partly because of its huge population the @entity17 said @entity3 has prospered outside the eurozone and will continue to do so , while our low taxes have promoted growth			1
by comparison , things are so bad in recession - hit @entity57 that this year the size of its economy has been exceeded by @entity61			0
@entity3 avoided a double - dip recession in the wake of the 2008 global economic crisis , and has now returned steadfastly to growth			0
the @entity3 ’s economy is set to grow by 1.4 per cent this year – well ahead of countries struggling under the yoke of the eurozone			0
last night a @entity71 spokesman said the study vindicates @entity16 ’s austerity programme			0
he said : ‘ @entity3 ’s hard work is paying off and the long - term economic plan is working			0
‘ the economy is growing , the deficit is falling and jobs are being created and while this report is encouraging , the job is not yet done			0
so the government will go on taking the difficult decisions needed to secure a responsible recovery for all			0
’ the study by the @entity17 looks at the 30 largest economies in the world and predicts how they will fare in the coming years			1
it finds that @entity49 will overtake the @entity20 as the world ’s largest economy in around 2028			0
the report outlines how the so - called @entity94 countries – @entity26 , @entity61 , @entity27 and @entity49 – will soon start to outstrip their @entity96 counterparts as their industrialisation takes hold			1
@entity27 is predicted to outstrip @entity101 ’s economy by 2028			1
despite this exceptional rise , @entity3 is still giving the country millions of pounds in aid			0
hailing the strength of @entity3 ’s recovery , the @entity17 said population growth would be a factor in our future success			1
@entity4 , on the other hand , is set to see its population plummet			2
booming : @entity49 is expected to beat the @entity20 to the top spot			0
pictured : workers at a clothing factory in @entity116 changes : @entity27 will surge ahead but still receives @entity3 aid , while @entity11 could have grim times ahead however , the @entity17 warned that @entity3 ’s prospects could be harmed if it fails to trade more with developing and growing countries such as @entity49			1
the economists hinted that leaving the @entity123 could also be bad for our prospects , and that if @entity126 leaves the union that would hit the size of our gdp			0
their report added : the factors driving the @entity3 ’s overtaking @entity4 are the assumption of a falling value for the @entity135 , @entity4 ’s falling population and the @entity3 ’s rising population			1
’ the @entity17 said that by 2028 , the @entity3 economy is forecast to be only 3 per cent smaller than the @entity4 economy , meaning it is likely to become the largest @entity142 economy by around 2030			1
if the euro breaks up , the outlook for @entity4 gdp would be much better and the outlook for the other @entity142 economies correspondingly worse			2
on the assumption that the euro holds , @entity4 drops from the fourth - largest economy in 2013 to the sixth largest in 2028 – after which it would drop below the @entity3			2
for @entity11 the drop is worse – from fifth in 2013 to 10th in 2023 and 13th in 2028			2
@entity17 ’s latest forecasts now show @entity49 overtaking the @entity20 in 2028 to become the world ’s largest economy			2
this is later than some analysts have suggested and reflects the continuing performance of the @entity20 as the @entity157 ’s strongest economy and the slowing down of the @entity49 economy			0
@entity27 is expected to overtake @entity101 in 2028 to become the world ’s third largest economy			2
@entity26 overtook the @entity3 in 2011 to briefly become the world ’s sixth largest economy			2
but it has since fallen back and is not expected to overtake again until 2023 .			0

we are seat to leapfrog @entity4 and @entity11 but lose to @entity27 and @entity26
@entity165 and our *refusal* to join @entity135 put us in good stead , study claims
