according to new research by @entity10 scientists prehistoric man had discovered that using a mixture of frayed and sharpened sticks to clean his teeth after a meal gave him healthy gnashers long after other animals had lost theirs to decay			1
it was the start of man 's ability to live longer than other members of the animal kingdom , giving him time in which he could learn and invent , thus laying the foundations for modern civilisation			2
by gum ! the primitive toothbrush was used to clean the teeth of food after meals , and also kept gums healthy be regular grooming the groundbreaking discovery was made by scientists at the @entity34 and @entity35 in collaboration with the @entity37 of @entity38 and the @entity39			2
they found that the primitive toothbrush was not only used to clean food from between teeth after meals but , in doing so , made for healthier gums and therefore a longer life			0
they worked out the regularity with which prehistoric man used the rudimentary toothbrush by tracing the marks made by the wood on the teeth of various jawbones from throughout the ages			2
for tooth ! the regular cleaning using sticks was demonstrated by the marks the wood made on the teeth meaning healthy teeth for longer , and that meant longer life , said researchers earliest evidence of the removal of food debris from between teeth was found by the team in ' homo habilis ' , who lived between 1.9 and 1.6 million year ago			1
the latest research made in fossil remains of @entity71 shows that sticks were also used to ' ease the pain ' caused by several oral diseases			1
the researchers published an article in the journal @entity78 , ' toothpicking and periodontal disease in a @entity71 specimen from @entity81 of @entity82 '			0
@entity84 man : the removal of food debris from between teeth was found by the team in ' @entity67 ' , who lived between 1.9 and 1.6 million year ago as well as @entity67 , the scientists studied fossil remains of a person who lived between 150,000 and 50,000 years ago and found that , despite heavy wear , he had no cavities			1
they believe he had used a stick several times a day to relieve the discomfort that an unknown periodontal disease caused him , resulting in two grooves on the contact between two teeth			0
use of sticks in ancient species is widely documented , but this is the first time it 's been shown to have been used for toothache and for dental hygiene .			0

@entity10 scientists say *cavemen* used frayed and sharpened sticks on teeth
it kept their teeth healthier *allowing* man to live longer than other animals
researchers say regular cleaning shown by marks the wood made on teeth
the practice first used by ' @entity67 ' between 1.9m and 1.6m years ago
they were also used to ' ease the pain ' caused by several oral diseases
