the phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by @entity42 and @entity43 , but they sell at much lower prices , ranging from about $ 95 to $ 280			0
in comparison , an @entity45 starts at $ 650 without subsidies for signing two - year contracts			1
@entity0 — pronounced schow - mee — has made a name in @entity2 by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices , using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low			1
some analysts have hailed the company as the @entity2 equivalent of @entity42 , in part because of its intensely loyal fans			0
there are some significant differences between the two companies ' approach , though			0
while @entity42 tends to keep its future product plans secret , @entity0 has invited customers to nosh on popcorn at company parties , chat on @entity0 's online forums and review or make suggestions for new features , which @entity0 frequently builds into its weekly software updates			2
' we do n't have customers or users			0
they prefer to be addressed ( as ) fans , ' said @entity24 , who defected from his job overseeing @entity27 's @entity82 products in 2013 to help plot @entity0 's expansion outside @entity2			2

while the @entity45 still dominates the smaller luxury segment of @entity2 's market , @entity0 's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders			1
@entity0 sold about 61 million phones last year , more than tripling its 2013 volume , @entity113 said			1
that established @entity0 as @entity2 's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out @entity43 at 14 percent , according to research firm @entity127			1

the @entity28 from @entity2 firm @entity0 has a 5.7 - inch display , is 6.95mm thick and weighs 161g			2
this makes it 0.2 - inches larger , 0.15mm thinner and 11 lighter than @entity42 's @entity45 ( comparison pictured ) but executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the @entity8 , where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices			1
that could make @entity0 's low - margin business model less effective here			2

' i do n't see it as flattery , ' he said , ' i actually see it as theft			0
' sir @entity165 said seeing knockoff designs made him think of the lengthy development cycle that went into producing the originals			0
in addition , @entity0 has been accused of copying — or at least closely imitating — some designs from @entity42 or other companies			2
at a @entity30 event thursday , executives stressed an array of software and features that @entity0 has developed to run on top of the @entity82 system that @entity27 makes available for other device makers			0
when asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter @entity0 from selling phones in the @entity8 , @entity113 said that 's not a major issue for his company			1
@entity0 raised $ 1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $ 45 billion			0
