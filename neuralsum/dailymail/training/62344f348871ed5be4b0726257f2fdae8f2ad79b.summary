it is a statement on the size of sir @entity3 ’s challenge that the @entity4 of @entity6 ’s husband is the great , great , great , great - grandson of the @entity8 who first watched @entity9 lose what became known as the @entity11			1
that was on the misty @entity13 in 1851 when @entity8 @entity14 asked who was in second place			2
‘ your majesty , there is no second , ’ she was told			2
the schooner @entity22 , which saluted the @entity8 by dipping its ensign three times , beat the @entity24 , winning a victory for the new world over the old and ending @entity9 ’s supremacy of the seas			1
will to win : sir @entity3 is desperate to win the @entity11 for @entity9 patriotic : @entity30 turned down more lucrative offers to lead a team representing @entity9 we have not won the @entity11 from that day to this			1
so on tuesday in @entity34 — in the appropriately august setting of the @entity36 in @entity34 , and accompanied by the @entity4 , herself a keen sailor — @entity30 launched his team for the 35th @entity11 by saying : ‘ we want to right a wrong and bring the @entity11 back to @entity41 waters for the first time			1
1851 the first edition of the @entity11 , making it the oldest international trophy in sport 0 no @entity41 team has won the @entity11 90 the typical number of staff on an @entity11 team 3 the qualifying rounds to determine which team faces @entity54 will take three years 62 the boat used in the final match will be a 62 foot catamaran , crewed by eight sailors ‘ as a country we have won the @entity64 in rugby and football , @entity59 , the @entity60 , but this is the last great historic prize never won by @entity9			1
’ @entity30 ’s desire to win the @entity11 for @entity9 caused him to turn down lucrative offers — potentially worth £ 2million — to compete as a hired hand for one of the other competitors , as he did when he helped @entity54 to their astonishing 9 - 8 victory from 8 - 1 down last year			1
‘ there were other teams on the markets and we did have a few discussions , ’ he said , ‘ but i wanted to do this as a @entity41 skipper , not for any other country			0
’ he also feels a deep personal motivation			0
he has been entranced by the @entity11 since , when aged 12 , he saw @entity88 83 , the yacht owned by @entity84 , ‘ i dreamed about doing this and read all the books about it , ’ he said			1
the prize itself , the 4ft tall silver @entity11 , which is known as the @entity11 and is kept in the @entity90 , was flown to @entity93 in its own first class seat			2
a guard even slept with it overnight			0
in the @entity34 sun , it was handled carefully by two men in white gloves and placed between @entity30 and the @entity4 for the photographers to capture			2
launch : @entity30 announced his intentions alongside the @entity4 in @entity34 missing piece : @entity30 claimed the @entity11 was the last historic prize never won by @entity105 to try to win it for @entity9 , @entity30 is pulling together an £ 80million bid drawn from private and commercial sources			1
part of that fortune is in place or underwritten ; the rest , he hopes , will follow			0
sir @entity113 , the @entity115 founder , and sir @entity116 , the entrepreneur who was instrumental in bringing the @entity117 to @entity93 , have contributed to the fund			2
both are avid sailors and were involved in the last — aborted — @entity41 bid in the guise of @entity122			0
@entity30 ’s cache as the most decorated @entity117 sailor in history , has helped him to poach some impressive crew members			1
they include the powerful @entity128 , who has won the @entity11 three times — the first man @entity30 phoned as he assembled his star cast			1
as well as another @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity41 sailors @entity133 and @entity135 , both of whom competed in the event last year , and @entity139 , the world match race champion , are in place			1
@entity133 was particularly pleased that the @entity142 complimented him on his thick - rim glasses			1
‘ she said it was a good look , ’ he reported afterwards			0
select band : @entity30 's team is made up of @entity128 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity135 and @entity139 the protocol , as the rules are known , stipulate that 25 per cent of the eight - man crew must be @entity41			1
that is at least an improvement on the last staging of the event , when there was no eligibility regulation at all			0
‘ i ’d like as many @entity41 guys involved as possible , ’ said @entity30 , though he is aware — as are @entity113 and @entity158 on the commercial side — that to succeed they must embrace the inter-national possibilities open to them			2
the design team is crucial for an @entity166 wingsail catamaran			0
@entity30 will draw heavily from @entity167 to get every aerodynamic advantage he can			1
these boats travel 10 miles in 25 minutes			0
in 1851 it took them 11hr 37m to circumnavigate the @entity173			0
what next ? the @entity41 bid is likely to be based in @entity175			0
their racing programme in the @entity178 in 2015 and 2016 will include about six events a year			0
there will then be a qualifying series in 2017 , from which a challenger will emerge to take on @entity54 in the @entity184 itself			0
and the name of the boat ? @entity30 said he will write @entity189 — the moniker he gives to all his crafts — in @entity192 somewhere unobtrusive for tradition ’s sake , but the official name is likely to be grander			2
location , location , location : the @entity200 in @entity175 are the proposed site for @entity202			0

sir @entity3 wants to add @entity11 to @entity9 's sporting haul
@entity30 turned down lucrative *financial* offers from elsewhere to compete
he has assembled an all - star crew including @entity133 and @entity135
@entity30 will draw heavily from @entity167 for aerodynamic advantage
