by @entity0 with his cute whiskers and glossy fur , he looks as gentle and benign as could be			2
when he ’s not indoors being petted by his owners , you ’d probably expect @entity5 the tom to be playing in the garden , perhaps chasing the occasional bird			1
but things are n’t quite so perfect in the @entity11 village of @entity12 , where he lives			1
mean face : shiny the four - year - old male cat who has terrorised the neighbourhood of @entity12 , @entity17 @entity18 say @entity19 is terrorising the area and have branded him ‘ devil cat ’			1
police have been called five times over his violent behaviour , which has left locals and their pets in need of medical treatment			1
they want the four - year - old cat to be put down			1
his owners , however , insist he is innocent and the injured must have done something to provoke him			1
police are powerless to act because laws designed to combat dangerous dogs do n’t apply to cats			2
@entity39 was taken to @entity40 in july after @entity19 ran into her home and sank his claws into her arms and legs			1
the 42 - year - old had bruising and cuts that required antibiotics			2
she said : ‘ he was hanging off my arm by his claws			2
he eventually let go and ran away but i had to go to hospital as my arm had become quite swollen			2
i love cats and i ’d never normally complain – but this animal is out of control			0
’ neighbour @entity56 said @entity5 clawed her 90 - year - old mother			0
she said : ‘ she had a large skin tear down the arm , which we had to dress every day for three weeks , and two big puncture wounds on the back of her leg			0
it is just four sets of claws and a set of teeth coming at you			0
’ another local said she used to use water to shoo @entity5 away but has also had to throw hot tea over him			0
vicious : the injuries sustained by @entity39 who was attacked by @entity5 ouch : the injuries sustained by @entity79 's cat ( left ) and those sustained by @entity82 's cat ( right ) @entity82 , 43 , said : ‘ it launched off the fence and attached itself to my arm			1
i had to throw hot tea over it			0
’ @entity19 has also laid into cats and dogs , costing owners vets ’ bills			1
@entity79 ’s elderly cat was attacked a couple of weeks ago by @entity5 and was left with gaping cuts			0
the 34 - year - old carer said : ‘ we ’re living in misery – he ’s like a devil cat			0
we ’ve had a fence and a gate put in our front garden to try and stop him coming in , but he persists			1
‘ the laws need to be changed so the same rules apply for cats as they do dogs			0
if a cat attacks a person , they should be put down			1
’ terrifying : @entity19 has been branded @entity110 's most ferocious feline after putting residents and pets in hospital watch out ! two - year - old @entity114 ( left ) with @entity5 , who has terrorised the neighbourhood of @entity12 , and ( right ) @entity5 , looking malevolent @entity5 ’s owners @entity116 and @entity118 , who live in the village with their three children , have had him since he was a kitten			1
they say they had @entity19 neutered after miss @entity39 was attacked			1
mrs @entity124 , 32 , a learning support student , said : ‘ i know people had problems with @entity5 before but since he ’s been neutered we ’ve seen no signs of violent behaviour			2
‘ he ’s an outdoor cat but will come inside and have his food around our two - year - old @entity114 – we ’ve never had any issues with our children			0
these people must have done something for him to act that way			0
he would n’t attack them out of the blue			0
‘ we ’ve had the police knocking on our door about five times , and have had the @entity143 here – it ’s getting ridiculous			0
the @entity143 found no problem with @entity5			0
’ her 34 - year - old husband , a dispatch supervisor , said : ‘ it ’s getting unfair on @entity5			0
if we genuinely thought this cat was attacking innocent people we would have him put down			2
’ trying to curb his behaviour : @entity118 , 34 , with his black tom cat shiny @entity114 with @entity5 , whose victims are so scared they retreat behind locked doors and arm themselves with hoses and mugs of hot tea whenever they see the bushy black cat prowling the streets			1

locals in @entity163 call him the ' @entity164 ' because of vicious *reputation*
his owners say they are trying to curb their pet 's behaviour
but @entity19 's victims want him put down after he terrorised their village
