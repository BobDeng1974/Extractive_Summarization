' dr @entity0 , right , the co-founder of @entity0 began in 1959 with just five pupils			1
now , on average , classes contain 40 to 50 students and teachers say lessons work well with that number ' it was only when me and my wife persuaded a woman to send the children from her extended family that it all started , and even then it was only five children			1
' we started from very humble beginnings and back then we only had a loan of 300 rupees ( £ 3 at current rates ) to fund our school			1
' but from word of mouth it slowly spread and children started coming			1
year after year the numbers swelled			0
' i never thought that one day we would have the world 's biggest school			1

' workforce : @entity12 employs an army of 3,800 staff , including teachers , support staff , cleaners , rickshaw drivers , and even electricians , carpenters and gardeners @entity12 's sheer size means it has never convened for an assembly - because there is no venue large enough to house them all			0
@entity116 , the current head teacher and daughter of founder dr. @entity41 , said : ' the whole of @entity33 would be jammed if we tried because one bus holds 50 children , so we 'd need 1,000 buses to bring them together			2

some of its past alumni have gone on to work for the @entity131 , studied at @entity132 and worked for @entity133 the school prides itself on its high values and ethics and teaches children how to be good citizens within the community ' but there are challenges too - standing out ahead of your peers is difficult			1
you have to work twice as hard to make sure you get noticed , otherwise you are just another student among thousands of others			0
' fellow pupil @entity159 , also 14 , added : ' it is definitely competitive , particularly to get into the school teams			2
' but if you make one then you can certainly feel proud of that because you are the creme of the crop			0
' he added : ' we are taught not only traditional subjects but good values			0
dr. @entity41 is an inspiration for us all to be good citizens			0
' class sizes range from 25 pupils all the way up to 50 in a single room			2
each pupil is also assigned a teacher who is responsible for his or her pastoral care , something staff believe means no one gets neglected or forgotten			0
the school receives no government funding ; children 's parents are charged a low fee for their children to attend getting into a school team is a challenge with so many pupils but also means that they strive harder to achieve , one student said			1
worship , right , is also an important part of daily school life miss @entity193 , who has taught @entity194 at @entity12 for the past six years , said : ' there is a good rapport between the students and the teachers			2
it is very easy to teach them and there are not many problems with them			0
