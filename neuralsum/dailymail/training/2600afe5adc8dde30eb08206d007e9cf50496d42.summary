since returning to his childhood home this month on vacation , president @entity0 has spent a good part of most days cloistered with three people whose company puts him at ease			1
they 're not his wife and daughters , who came with him , but a trio of pals whose friendship dates back to @entity0 's high school days in @entity15			1
the three men - @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 - are among the few people still in @entity0 's life who knew him long before he was famous			1
on this visit alone , @entity0 has spent more than 22 hours with the group on the lush golf courses that dot the island of @entity54			2
when it rained , @entity0 and his pals went bowling , instead			2
and on tuesday , in what 's become a yearly tradition , the men and their families gathered for a luau hosted by @entity18			1
with rain drizzling over @entity54 , @entity0 's motorcade whisked @entity0 across the island to @entity18 's beachside home in @entity67 , about an hour outside of @entity33 on the @entity68			1
increasingly , the reunions have become the focal point of @entity0 's family vacation in his second term as his teenage daughters spend less and less time at their father 's side			2
once content to join their parents for outings to the aquarium or to get shave ice , @entity77 and @entity78 are now more independent			0
since arriving more than a week ago , @entity0 has been out in public with one of his daughters only once , briefly , during a hike			0
what @entity0 and his companions talk about during their many hours alone is anyone 's guess			0
but the foursome rarely goes more than a few months without reconvening in one arrangement or another			0
harking back : the foursome gather often , whether in @entity95 or at other @entity97 retreats firm friends : @entity0 , shown above when he was a senator in 2008 , is seen walking away from a memorial ceremony for his mother alongside @entity18 , second from left , @entity19 right in august , @entity0 kicked off his 53rd birthday weekend golfing with the three friends in suburban @entity103 before heading to @entity104 , the presidential retreat in the @entity106			1
all four were classmates at @entity108 in @entity33 , which @entity0 has described as ' a prestigious prep school , an incubator for island elites			1
' in his memoir , ' @entity112 , ' @entity0 recalled a high school career that was , for the most part , ordinary â€” ' marginal report cards and calls to the principal 's office ; part - time jobs at the burger chain ; acne and driving tests and turbulent desire			0
' ' i 'd made my share of friends at school , gone on the occasional awkward date , ' @entity0 wrote on vacation : @entity0 is pictured above hiking with daughter @entity78 - but his children spend less and less time with him on vacation now ' and if i sometimes puzzled over the mysterious realignments of status that took place among my classmates , as some rose and others fell depending on the whims of their bodies or the make of their cars , i took comfort in the knowledge that my own position had steadily improved			1
' far less is known about @entity0 's buddies , of course , than about the president himself			0
all three live mostly private lives when they 're not being photographed with the commander in chief			0
@entity17 , who graduated from @entity108 in 1978 , bonded with @entity0 over their mutual affinity for jazz			1
he 's lived in @entity153 , but was listed as a @entity155 resident when in 2012 he attended a state dinner at the @entity157 that @entity0 held for @entity159 prime minister @entity158			0
@entity18 , who golfed another two days with @entity0 this month before the others got into town , was a year behind @entity0 at @entity108			1
@entity18 has worked as a commercial fisherman and an airline employee , according to the school 's alumni magazine			1
in 2011 , he pleaded no contest to soliciting a prostitute , but @entity0 has stayed fiercely loyal to his childhood friend			0
connection ? analysts have suggested that @entity0 's new life - full of security , demands and motorcades ( above ) - has led him to especially value to companionship of his old friends @entity0 played basketball at @entity108 with @entity19 , who the alumni magazine says is now a building contractor			1
aging photos show @entity0 and @entity19 decked out in 1970s fashion with their dates before attending a high school prom			2
among @entity186 presidents , @entity0 is not alone in carving out time regularly to reconnect with his roots			0
@entity188 made frequent trips back to @entity190 , @entity191 , throwing picnics or barbecues for former neighbors and friends , and @entity196 remained pals with men he served with in @entity199 in the second term , presidents have often sought refuge from the pressure by disappearing into nature to fish or hunt , said @entity205 , a presidential historian at @entity206			2
but such solitude has become less and less attainable for presidents in modern times			0
' many people call @entity0 aloof , and he has n't made a lot of friends in @entity95 , ' @entity205 said			0
' when you 're president , everybody wants something from you and only these types of friends are able to simply want your well - being			2
they have a different level of affection for you than friends you meet later in life			0

president has spent much of his @entity227 vacation with three men
played sport and *relaxed* with @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19
the pals , who all went to @entity108 in @entity15 , still meet often
@entity234 is known about the men - but all seem to have *humble* occupations
