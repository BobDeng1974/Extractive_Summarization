grizzly bears in @entity2 have begun to follow hunters , researchers believe			1
a government project fitted eight bears in the area with gps			2
it found that bears stalk @entity11 hunters to steal their prey , tracking them almost from the moment they leave their cars			2
hunting the hunters : the team found a bear fitted with @entity7 followed downwind of hunters as they went after an elk - possibly looking to steal it from them once it had been killed			1
in one encounter already tracked , as one group of hunters left a parking area at around 6 a.m. they turned on their gps			0
as they moved around a lake in search of elk a nearby gps - collared grizzly starts moving in the same direction behind and to the side of the hunters — probably downwind of them			1
at one point , the bear is within about 100 yards of the hunters who never knew it was there			1
after bedding down around noon , the bear picks up the hunters ' now - cold trail and follows them again , possibly hoping they would shoot an elk			1
already , data has shown at least one grizzly following oblivious elk hunters almost from the moment they left the parking lot , according to the @entity50			2
scientists believe the bear may have been following the humans in hopes of getting to a fallen elk before they did			2
in one encounter already tracked by the @entity2 team , as a group of hunters moved around a lake in search of elk a nearby gps - collared grizzly starts moving in the same direction behind and to the side of the hunters — probably downwind of them			1
at one point , the bear is within about 100 yards of the hunters , who never knew it was there			1
after bedding down around noon , the bear picks up the hunters ' now - cold trail and follows them again , possibly hoping they would shoot an elk			1
' @entity76 opportunistically scavenge carcasses throughout the active season and commonly usurp kills of other predators , such as cougars and , since their reintroduction in 1995 , gray wolves , ' the @entity72 , which carried out the study , said			0
' remains left by hunters also provide grizzly bears with meat , and bears are attracted to areas outside of national parks when these remains become available during the fall			0
' experts have previously said they believe bears stalk hunters from as close as the length of a football field in order to steal their prey			0
in one encounter already tracked by the @entity2 team , as a group of hunters moved around a lake in search of elk a nearby gps - collared grizzly starts moving in the same direction the @entity72 , part of the @entity107 , started the project over the summer , by tagging the grizzlies in the @entity110			1
the team also asked elk hunters to carry 100 gps units that track their routes			1
grizzlies have been known to steal the prey of hunters and fishermen alike			0
scientists believe they may even listen for the sound of gunshots , knowing that they signal a meal to be scavenged			0
the team track bears to follow their breeding and hunting habits			0
hunters and bears often collide in the fall because of a common interest in eating fresh , wild protein			0
fall hunting season brings a number of individuals into the woods hoping to move stealthy and sneak up on deer and elk			0
at the same time , the grizzlies are in ' hyperphagia ' , which is the stage before they enter hibernation			0
during this time , the grizzlies are consuming as many calories as possible to gain fat for their long slumber			0
gut piles and carcasses left by hunters provide an easy source of food			0
eight @entity2 grizzly bears have been outfitted with gps trackers in an ongoing study grizzly bears ' have a sense of smell seven times greater than that of a bloodhound , and 100 times that of a human by some estimates			1
grizzlies also possess a @entity162 's organ in the roof of their mouth that can detect heavier moisture - borne odors			0
animals such as elk may travel for miles after being wounded , leaving hunters the task of tracking them even as bears may be doing the same			2
so attuned to the movements of hunters are the bears that @entity160 are known scavengers , and officials noted there have been cases of the mighty bruins attacking hunters as they dressed elk in the field			2
@entity182 now requires successful bison hunters outside of @entity184 to move carcasses and gut piles 200 yards away from homes , roads and trails to lessen the chances of human - bear interactions , according to the @entity50 .			1

eight bears in @entity2 were fitted with trackers as part of *experiment*
team found bear followed downwind of hunters as they went after an elk
@entity76 came within 100 yards of the hunters - who never knew it was there
