by @entity1 reporter a incredibly well - preserved example of a fossilised marine creature is set to fetch £ 100,000 at auction			1
the 6ft long ichthyosaur was discovered by a fossil hunter at low tide after rough seas tore away a section of cliff			1
the unnamed fossil enthusiast worked tirelessly for three days to collect the 200 million - year - old remains before expected storms would have ultimately destroyed it			1
the 6ft long ichthyosaur ( pictured ) was uncovered in the late 1990s and is now up for auction			1
the beasts would have looked similar to dolphins but were reptilian he removed sections of rock from the cliffs known as @entity22 , near @entity23 , @entity24 , and took them to local preparator @entity25			1
mr @entity25 then spent hundreds of hours chipping away at the rock to expose the fossilised bones of the ichthyosaur			1
the result is one of the most impressive examples ever found , with the ichthyosaur in the same leaping position as when it died			1
remarkably , one of its paddles on its side is preserved in @entity38 protruding from its body at an angle of 45 degrees			1
@entity41 - literally meaning ' fish - lizards ' - were giant marine reptiles that resembled dolphins and thrived during much of the mesozoic era			1
these huge animals rapidly diversified from being lizards with fins to developing a much more streamlined , fish - like form built for speed			2
one species has been calculated to have a cruising speed of 22mph ( 36 km / h )			2
they first appeared approximately 245 million years ago and at least one species survived until about 90 million years ago			2
the reptiles were particularly abundant in the @entity56 , until they were replaced as the top aquatic predators by another reptilian order , the plesiosaurs , in the @entity60			2
the specimen , that was uncovered in the late 1990s , is now being offered for sale at @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65			2
it has a pre-sale estimate of 80,000 pounds but is likely to go for more			0
@entity68 , a natural history expert and curator for the auction , said : ' when you find fossils like this one them they are n’t in the state that you now see			0
' a lot of the bone is covered in rock , probably is three or four very solid lumps and the finder would have had to use a wheelbarrow or something to remove it			0
' it had been exposed on a ledge by rough tides and had the fossil hunter not found it itcould have been washed away and broken up very quickly			1
' the fossil was prepared by @entity25 at his workshop in @entity89			0
the rock had to be drilled away very carefully , it is a painstakingly slow process			0
' we are talking about a huge amount of work that has gone into preparing it			0
@entity41 ( @entity96 pictured ) were giant marine reptiles that resembled dolphins and thrived during much of the mesozoic era ' it is complete and in a beautiful state of preservation and has been very well prepared			0
” @entity41 swam in the sea at the same time dinosaurs roamed the land , which was around 220 to 65 million years ago			0
the beasts would have looked similar to dolphins but were reptilian			0
@entity108 , born in 1799 in @entity23 , helped extract a complete ichthyosaur when she was just 12 years old			0
the ichthyosaur is being sold on november 27 .			0

the 6ft long creature was exposed by rough seas at @entity22 in @entity24
remarkably , one of its paddles on its side is preserved in @entity38 protruding from its body at an angle of 45 degrees
