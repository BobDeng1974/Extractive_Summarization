by @entity0 published : 04:02 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 08:12 est , 18 june 2013 @entity5 groomed a girl at 12 and made her read him graphic passages from lovemaking manual the @entity9 in his @entity11 dressing room , one of his victims said today			1
the woman , now 39 , has tearfully told for the first time how the disgraced it 's a @entity16 presenter abused her and ' put his tongue in my mouth '			1
speaking about reading him excerpts from the book , called the ' gourmet guide to lovemaking ' , she said as an innocent 12 - year - old she began to blush and became very upset because it was so sexually graphic			2
shame : @entity5 , 83 , who was jailed for 15 months , asked a 12 - year - old victim to read him the @entity9 in his @entity11 dressing room , the woman involved said today it came as yesterday @entity5 , 83 , was told he would serve barely two weeks in prison for each of the young girls he sexually abused			1
the sentence prompted a wave of outrage and fury , with victims saying it made a mockery of their horrific ordeal and politicians and campaigners condemning it as ' incredibly lenient '			2
he was jailed for 15 months after admitting that he indecently assaulted 13 girls between 1967 and 1986			1
his youngest victim was nine			2
@entity5 targeted the new victim who spoke out today how she was invited to the @entity11 @entity49 studios with a friend after he approached them at a petrol station			1
at the time he presented @entity53 and told staff the girls were his ' nieces ' and he was giving them elocution lessons - a way he managed to target children and young girls over several decades			0
two years after he had forced her read him the graphic sex manual , @entity5 targeted her again on the set of @entity63 , when she was 14 , and began feeding her champagne			1
' then he kissed me on the lips and put his tongue in my mouth			1
i felt sick afterwards , ' she told @entity71 jailed : a court sketch showing @entity5 in the dock as he was sentenced to 15 months in prison driven away : @entity5 hid his face as he was taken from @entity76 in a prison van after sentencing @entity5 then turned up a again a year later when she finished her exams at school and gave her and friends a lift home , and then tried to encourage them to come home with him			1
' we were going to turn 16 and he kept telling us to come and see him when we did			0
looking back it was all part of the grooming process			2
' the @entity11 said yesterday it was ' appalled that some of @entity5 's crimes took place in connection with his work at the @entity11 and offers an unreserved apology to the people he abused '			1
under sentencing rules @entity5 will be released automatically after serving just half the term and the attorney general has already been forced to agree to review the sentence after being inundated with complaints			1
he was last night examining whether it was ' unduly lenient ' and should be referred back to the @entity104			2
guilty : the former it 's a knockout presenter initially denied the charges and told police his victims were lying before pleading guilty politicians and child protection charities were among those who condemned the former @entity11 presenter 's sentence , saying it sent the wrong message to victims of historic sex abuse following the @entity120 scandal			1
when @entity5 was first arrested last december , he told police his victims were all lying as part of a ' vendetta going on against people in the public eye '			2
but the publicity led to more women coming forward , and in april the married father of two finally admitted 14 counts of indecent assault			1
the pleas could only be revealed last month , after reporting restrictions were lifted			0
last night two of the women who helped bring the predator to justice led the condemnation of his sentence			0
the pair waived their legal right to anonymity in the @entity142 last month			0
@entity143 was 16 when @entity5 lured her to @entity11 premises on the false pretext of helping her record a song , before attacking her in his car			1
mrs @entity143 , now 61 , said : ' his victims deserved more			0
i hope that he has an uncomfortable time in prison and reflects on the gravity of what he did			0
' i feel that the sentence should have been higher especially taking into account the age of some of his victims			0
' the mother of one added : ' his lenient sentence will not act as deterrent to others who go on to sexually abuse youngsters			0
i am pretty shocked by it and feel that he has almost walked free and it has made a mockery of what the victims have been through			0
' this is after all his denials and calling us all liars and the claims spurious , callous and cruel â€“ he has never personally apologised for what he has done and he is not remorseful			0
' victim @entity143 from @entity174 , @entity175 , ( right ) and ( left ) wearing the pale blue suit she was wearing on the day that @entity5 indecently assaulted her @entity178 @entity177 aged 15 or 16 ( left ) when she was a pupil at @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181 , and ( right ) following @entity5 's guilty plea @entity183 was 17 when @entity5 fondled her breasts at a show in @entity186			1
now 55 , she told the @entity142 : ' when he made those comments outside court about our allegations being false i felt like i had been abused all over again			0
he does not appear to be remorseful at all			0
' another of @entity5 's victims , who was also 17 when he molested her , told @entity195 that ' justice has not been done '			1
the woman , identified only as @entity198 , added : ' it 's a mockery			0
it 's not helping any future cases at all			0
it 's not helping the victims			0
it 's just giving people like @entity5 a slap on the wrist			2
