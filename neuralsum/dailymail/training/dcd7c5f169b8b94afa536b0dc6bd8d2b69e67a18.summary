wheelchair - users mothers and fathers have complained that only one person is allowed to accompany them at paralympic venues disabled mother - of - two @entity21 said she felt ' non-human ' when she was told her family could not sit with her at the events which start on august 29			1
outraged by the poor provisions for disabled visitors she has launched a petition on @entity28 which has attracted more than 12,000 signatures			0
the wheelchair user of @entity32 , @entity30 said she had tried to book tickets for a cycling event at the @entity35 for her husband and carer , @entity38 , autistic four - year - old son @entity39 and her baby daughter			1
but she claims a @entity42 official told her because she was disabled only one accompanying adult could sit with her in the wheelchair area			1
the 32 - year - old said : ' they would n't even allow me to pay full adult price for the children to sit on my lap. they said my kids , would have to sit somewhere else - which of course they could absolutely not			1
it 's because i 'm in a wheel - chair			2
i can not believe that at this event , which could inspire a new generation of athletes , has a discriminatory ticket policy			0
' quite apart from these practical considerations i want to share this special occasion with my family			0
' however , she added : ' this is n't just about my family - it 's about making sure every family is able to enjoy the @entity3 together now and in the future			1
' mrs @entity68 says she is unable to attend any of the @entity3 events because of the seating plans and lack of consideration for families with a disabled parent or child			1
wheelchair - users @entity21 , who has a four - year - old autistic son and a 19 - month - old baby complained about the @entity3 ' ' discriminatory ticketing policy ' she said another adult would have to buy a ticket to accompany her children as it is essential her husband sits with her			1
she added : ' we like to do things together , despite me being in a wheelchair , and i ca n't believe that @entity42 have not made the provisions to cater for me and other families			0
' the self - styled ' mumpreneur ' who runs a craft box company @entity94 said : ' i do n't want special treatment - i just want to be treated the same as everyone else			0
' another disabled mother ; @entity99 , 43 , who bought six tickets eleven months ago for her eight - year - old twins , @entity102 and @entity103 , two wheelchair users and their carers , has labelled the seating rules a ' fiasco '			2
the actress from @entity109 , who specialises in professional voice - over work , said she contacted the tickets official after seeing the online petition			0
she said : ' when i spoke to the ticketing agent i was told i should n't have been sold the tickets as the children ca n't attend in without adult supervision			2
i was furious and shouted ' i am an adult ! ' ' she also told me that the computer system wo n't sell children 's tickets without an accompanying adult			2
' i am the twins ' sole carer , just like other single mums			0
it just so happens i 'm sitting on wheels			0
' she then backtracked and said she meant a non-disabled adult			0
' the mother from @entity109 added : ' the @entity131 planners have clearly made a terrible blunder and it is going to cause enormous pain and heartbreak for families planning to attend the @entity3			2
' the @entity137 ' organisers denied they had a policy that wheelchair users could only be accompanied by one other person when attending events			0
a @entity42 spokesman said : ' we designed our venues such that accessible seating will be located around the new venues at different price points so that wheelchair users can sit with their friends and families rather than in one single designated area , and we included a companion seat in the cost of a ticket for a wheelchair space			1
' with just a couple of weeks to go to the @entity137 , many sessions are now selling out and additional spaces are subject to the same availability as for non-wheelchair users			0
' the organisers for the @entity3 and the @entity137 have been under fire for poor organisation of tickets throughout both games			2
more than 2.2 million tickets have already been sold for the 12 - day @entity3 , and another 400,000 are due to go on sale in the coming days			1
but technical issues have prevented thousands from buying tickets online which has prompted a further wave of criticism on @entity171			0
@entity42 admitted the unexpected surge for tickets had caused initial problems but insisted these had now been resolved .			0
