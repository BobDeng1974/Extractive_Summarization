warning : @entity0 , head of the @entity3 , said today that customers ' can not be bothered ' to move banks because it is too difficult to work out if they will be better off millions of customers are paying £ 400 or more a year in unnecessary overdraft fees because @entity9 's biggest banks make it too hard to compare charges			1
@entity0 , head of the @entity3 ( @entity2 ) , said today that customers ' can not be bothered ' to move banks because it is too difficult to work out if they will be better off			1
it came as the @entity2 this morning launched a major investigation to challenge the stranglehold of @entity9 's big four banks on the finances of families and small businesses			1
the @entity2 is concerned that customers are being misled by the finance giants , which promote their services as ‘ free banking ’			1
@entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 are accused of controlling 77 per cent of the nation ’s 65million personal accounts but offering poor service and rip - off deals			1
the @entity33 says not enough customers are shifting to lenders with high levels of service , reducing choice in the market			1
there are also calls for a ' nuclear option ' , which would be to break the big four banks up to allow more competition			1
@entity0 told the @entity44 this morning that their complex overdraft charges have left some customers with fees of £ 400 a year because they ca n’t find better deals			1
‘ the market is not working well for public			0
many customers are dissatisfied by the banks and they find it difficult to compare the charges ' , he said			1
‘ the actual costs that people pay in overdraft charges can be quite considerable			1
there are 25million people with overdrafts and of those around two million a year are paying £ 400 a year or more in overdraft charge so that can be a considerable amount to pay			1
‘ it has got easier to switch accounts , within seven days , but that is just a three or four per cent a year			1
it must be that people find it difficult to compare and certainly if you want to compare what you would pay if you are overdrawn it is difficult to say			0
i think people are left scratching their heads and they think i can not work this out and i can not be bothered ’			1
the @entity2 's new investigation will look into why customers are reluctant to switch banks and the difficulties they have in comparing different accounts			1
@entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 have been accused of offering bad service and poor value deals to customers the @entity2 is also interested in why the market shares of the big four have not changed over time			1
mr @entity0 added : ' effective competition in retail banking is critically important for individual bank customers , small and medium - sized businesses , and the wider economy			1
' after carefully considering the consultation responses , most of which supported a market investigation , we remain of the view that there should be a full market investigation into the sector			1
' commenting the announcement , @entity100 , director general of the @entity101 said : ' this is undoubtedly the right decision as businesses want more competition and greater choice in the banking sector			1
' for many years @entity9 's dysfunctional banking sector has struggled to meet the needs of small to medium size enterprises ( @entity110 ) , impeding the growth prospects of some of our most promising young companies			1
' the independent @entity115 confirmed that a large number of firms across the country are unhappy with the level of service they receive from their bank			0
' this investigation represents a unique opportunity which must be seized , in order to deliver real change in the banking sector			1
' concerns have previously been raised that customers have been pressured by bank sales staff into taking accounts that carry a monthly fee of up to £ 20 in return for perks of little value ( file picture ) he added : ' we call on the government to commit to implementing the findings of the @entity2 's investigation to restore trust , transparency and relationships between lenders and businesses			1
' the probe will look at ways to make the banks spell out their charges in a simple format that would allow customers to make comparisons between them			1
another option likely to be considered is replacing ‘ free banking ’ with up - front monthly fees for accounts			1
this generates about £ 8billion in revenues from current account customers every year			1
in the past , bank bosses have said any attempt to disrupt their policies could lead to the blanket introduction of monthly fees on current accounts			2
many banks in the @entity169 , @entity170 , parts of @entity172 and @entity173 charge monthly fees for their services			2
banks in @entity176 charge a management fee of € 10 ( £ 7.80 ) for every three months – € 40 a year			2
on top of that , there is typically an annual fee of around € 40 for a debit card , or € 45 for a credit card that can be used overseas			0
@entity176 banks also charge € 1 a month for five text messages giving balance details			2
a bank might charge € 60 to allow a customer to have a long - term authorised overdraft , although the interest rates are capped at relatively low levels			0
in the @entity169 , the @entity192 has a standard fee of $ 12 ( £ 7.50 ) a month – $ 144 a year – for those who do not have a minimum balance of $ 1,500			0
there is also a fee of $ 2.50 for cash withdrawals from machines not owned by the bank			0
on top of that , overdraft charges can be extremely high , with a fee of up to $ 35 for every payment that is bounced			2
charges of £ 5 to £ 20 a month could be applied to accounts to cover a fixed number of cash withdrawals , cheques and bill payments through standing orders			1
anyone going beyond this would pay extra fees			0
the @entity215 received 319,505 complaints about current accounts in the first six months of this year , 11 per cent more than in the same period last year			2
investigators fear competition has diminished since the financial crash of 2007 - 8 because brands like the @entity222 have been swallowed up by @entity25 , while others have disappeared completely			1
efforts to encourage new small lenders to enter the market have had limited success , with only a few – including @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 – making any real impact			0
there is also damning evidence that the banks continue to fail small businesses by failing to offer loans			2
if you 're fed up with your bank there are plenty of reasons why now is a good time to switch to another provider			0

@entity280 offers a £ 125 gift card to new customers signing up to its @entity282			2
the bank account offers an automatic £ 500 overdraft with the first £ 100 interest - free			0
interest - paying current accounts @entity286 is tempting desperate savers with its @entity25 current account - offering up to 4 per cent for balances between £ 4,000 and £ 5,000			1
but you will have to pay in at least £ 1,500			0
tsb has also recently launched the interest - paying @entity291 , which pays 5 per cent on balances up to £ 2,000 and only requires a minimum monthly deposit of £ 500			2

spending on the account 's debit card also clocks up @entity317 points			0
it pays one @entity317 point for every £ 4 spent in @entity229 stores plus £ 8 you spend out of @entity229 , by @entity322 it was hoped that a system to help people switch bank within seven working days would boost competition , improve service and reduce fees			0
however , relatively few people have done so			0
the @entity2 said today that it is concerned about continuing barriers of entry and expansion in the sector , which limit the ability of smaller and newer providers to develop their businesses			0
the investigation will be conducted by a market reference group , drawn from the @entity2 's panel of independent members			0
the group will be appointed shortly and will publish a timetable for the investigation			0
investigations of this kind can take up to 18 months			0
@entity348 , founder of the @entity350 website , was among the consumer campaigners suggesting the inquiry could lead to the introduction of monthly fees			0
this would be more transparent , he said , but ‘ incredibly unpopular ’			0
@entity357 , of the campaign group which ? , said : ‘ it is now crunch time for the biggest banks that dominate a market blighted by a lack of trust and poor customer service			0
‘ we want the @entity2 to expose the cost to consumers of a lack of competition in the current account market and to pave the way for reform			0
’ mp @entity373 , chairman of the @entity374 , said consumers and small businesses had been getting a ‘ poor deal for decades because of a lack of effective competition and genuine choice in banking ’			1
