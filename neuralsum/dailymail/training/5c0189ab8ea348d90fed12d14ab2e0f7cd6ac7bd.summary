her 12 - year - old son , @entity34 , was also made to back up the story			0
although the killer has never been found , @entity7 ’s lawyer yesterday suggested that it was her estranged husband , @entity39 , to whom the victim was not related			2

he has since taken a ‘ very young ’ girl as his second wife and is ‘ enjoying life ’			0
@entity7 , who was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter and perverting the course of justice , sobbed as she was told she would serve at least three and a half years			2
