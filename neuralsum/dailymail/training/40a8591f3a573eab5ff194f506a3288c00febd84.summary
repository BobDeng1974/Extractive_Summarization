by @entity0 a mother used her teenage son ’s passport to fly from two @entity5 airports			1
@entity6 , 49 , was booked on a return @entity8 flight from @entity10 to @entity11			1
mrs @entity6 of @entity12 , @entity13 , was going through security when she realised she ’d picked up her 16 - year - old son @entity15 's passport by mistake			1
remarkably , she managed to board both her flights without any issue			2
@entity6 used her son @entity15 's passport as photo id to travel from @entity10 airport to @entity11 mrs @entity6 ' 16 - year - old son 's passport			1
the mother further managed to return to @entity10 from @entity11 using the same passport as photographic id a handful of airlines fly domestically , including @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 , who recently began a route between @entity36 and @entity11			1
many ask for photographic id at check - in gates for commercial reasons rather than security reasons			2
according to the @entity8 website , a passenger must show one of the following forms of @entity26 to fly domestically : all passengers on @entity8 international flights must be in possession of a valid passport and a valid visa if required			1
according to their website , @entity8 insist passengers must present one of several forms of identification to board an aircraft for domestic travel			1
a pension book is the only acceptable form of non-photographic @entity26 , it adds			2
speaking today , a spokesperson from @entity8 said the company require photo id for commercial reasons and not for security			2
they added there had not been a breach of security by letting mrs @entity69 on the flight			0
the mother said : ‘ i got to the airport early to meet up with the girls for a weekend away to @entity11 and it was only as we went through the security that i realised i had the wrong passport			1
‘ i was stood in the security queue when i just thought ‘ did i pick up the right passport ? ’ ‘ my face went white when i realised i only had @entity15 ’s passport and it went round the rest of the group like wildfire			1
‘ i rang my next door neighbours on each side and got one to scan over my passport as a text , but i realised he ’d have no time to get it to the airport before the flight			1
‘ i decided not to risk telling them about the mix up and there was lots of angst on my part			0
‘ but i could n’t believe it when they let me through - none of us thought for a minute that i would get through on a young boy ’s passport			2
the checks were clearly very poor			0
‘ once i got on the flight my neighbour passed my passport on to a teacher friend @entity108 , who was flying up later in the day			0
‘ i thought then that i would n’t have a problem getting back , but on the return the girls suggested i see if it could happen twice			0
' a few days later , mrs @entity6 attempted to return to @entity10 using her son 's passport			1
she said : ‘ amazingly on the sunday out of @entity11 exactly the same happened - nobody noticed that it was n’t my passport			1
‘ it was even more unbelievable that i could do the same thing on the way back			0
‘ in the light of what has happened to the @entity123 it is clear that security checks at airports have become much more lax and people making the checks must be much more careful for the sake of everyone ’s safety			0
mrs @entity6 with the passport			2
@entity8 insist on photographic id for domestic travel - with a pension book being the only acceptable form of non-photographic id @entity10 - where mrs @entity6 boarded her flight			1
a spokesman said today it is down to the airline to check passports ‘ @entity141 was an entirely innocent mistake with no bad intent at all , but we all know that there are people out there who want to bring terror to the skies above @entity5 , @entity150 and the @entity151 and they need to be caught before any more people die			0
’ a spokesman for @entity8 said : ' @entity8 can confirm that there is no requirement for passengers to be in possession of a passport or any other form of photographic @entity26 to fly domestically within the @entity5			1
' despite this however , @entity8 does have a policy to determine for its own purposes , a passenger ’s identity			0
' other methods can be , and are , used to satisfy this requirement and enable them to travel and we will be taking up the matter of @entity170 ’ travel with our airports and our third - party check - in agents			0
' a spokesman for @entity10 said : ‘ it is n’t airport staff who check passports			0
it is down to the airline and depends on @entity8 policy			0
‘ she was flying within the @entity5 , but people returning from overseas it is the @entity183 that checks passports			0
’ a spokesman from @entity11 said : ' there are no legal obligations for a passenger to carry their passport when flying within the @entity5			2
' when flying domestically , each airline specifies its own identification requirements			0
