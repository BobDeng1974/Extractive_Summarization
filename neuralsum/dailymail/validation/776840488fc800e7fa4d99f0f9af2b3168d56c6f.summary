@entity1 coach @entity0 flew out of @entity2 three weeks ago bemoaning boring @entity4 rugby			1
after saturday ’s spectacular conclusion to the 2015 @entity7 , you hope his television was n’t on the blink at his home in @entity11 and that he caught every single second of an engrossing 240 minutes spread across the three round five matches			0
the three teams who entered denouement day on six points apiece — @entity19 with a +37 points difference , @entity21 +33 and @entity22 +12 — all wound up on eight points each but with one crucial photo finish difference — @entity21 ’s calculus was revised upwards to +63 , six better than @entity19 ’s +57 and 10 clear of @entity22 ’ +53			1
@entity28 numbers , though , ca n’t properly tell the tale of this nerve - shredding afternoon where credit must go to @entity22 for transforming a slender 14 - 13 interval lead in @entity33 into the 61 - 20 thrashing and igniting the subsequent thirst for points at @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity39 ( left ) and @entity40 ( right ) arrive at @entity41 with the trophy fully in their grasp @entity21 's fans got a chance to touch the coveted @entity7 trophy outside @entity41 when it all ended , with @entity19 a metre short of the @entity51 line in forlorn search of the title - clinching converted try , @entity0 ’s eyes should have been watering with the wonder of it all			1
a whopping 27 tries — after just 36 in the four previous rounds ’ dozen games — in a 221 - point attacking rugby harvest			0
with eight - try @entity22 48 points clear of @entity65 , a margin that would have set @entity21 the target of a 28 - point win in @entity69 , a vital late twist had the air of 2007 revisited ( @entity65 scored a late try eight years ago to cut @entity21 ’s margin and @entity72 won the title by a points difference of +4 )			1
@entity65 winger @entity75 proved unstoppable from his 10 - metre line , touching down on 79:24 for the converted try that saw @entity21 ’s desired goal suddenly become a more manageable 21			2
@entity79 ( centre ) holds the @entity7 trophy in front of a mixture of youthful and experienced fans having scored just four tries in 320 minutes , they doubled that tally through @entity88 ’s fifth - minute opener and @entity90 ’s 25th and 72nd - minute brace either side of @entity93 ’s 50th - minute effort			2
then , @entity94 won a seemingly lost cause , marvellously knocking the ball from @entity97 as he went to ground for a consolation @entity100 try			0
it set @entity19 the chase of a 26 - point victory and they fell short , referee @entity104 penalising them on 80:12 at a ruck for sealing off			1
@entity21 were champions and it was just as well			0
if @entity19 had pounced for that deciding converted try , the finger of blame would have been pointed in @entity100 at both @entity39 and @entity110			0
with @entity21 20 points ahead and needing another score to jump ahead of @entity22 on the table , @entity39 inexplicably missed two penalty kicks in quick succession			1
@entity94 ( centre ) poses for a photograph with a young fan after returning to @entity21 the first effort , from in front of the posts close in , collided with an upright and the second , from the 10 - metre line , drifted wide to the right			2
he eventually recomposed himself , landing the pole - taking penalty on 62 minutes before signing off nine minutes later with cramp having energetically applied pressure to earn the lineout that was a foundation for the revitalised @entity90 ’ s second try			0
there was still time for another sloppy penalty miss , a nervous @entity110 pulling his close - in attempt to the left , but it would have been cruel had this hat - trick of missed penalties come back to haunt them a few hours later			0
unlike @entity22 , who needed a last - second penalty to secure a one - point @entity143 half - time lead , and unlike @entity19 , 15 - 10 in arrears until the 27th minute in @entity145 , @entity21 hit the front early and resolutely stayed there against the winless @entity147 , their only defensive aberration being @entity79 ’s error which left @entity150 defending a three - on - one overlap down the blindside of the ruck for @entity155 ’s converted try on the half hour			1
@entity21 were crowned @entity7 winners after a dramatic final day that saw them edge @entity19 and @entity22 other than this repeated weakness in shackling breakdown ball quickly shifted from right to left ( @entity72 and @entity22 scored against them in the same corner and @entity19 came within a whisker of doing the same ) , @entity21 fixed the issues that betrayed them in @entity22			1
they did n’t get stuck at the @entity37 ruck , did n’t start lethargically , didn ’ t trail by a dozen points 14 minutes in due to poor indiscipline , did n’t tactically kick inaccurately and did n’t blow up damagingly at the lineout due to talismanic @entity88 taking on the responsibility of calling a plethora of ball on himself			2
exuding pride in his team ’s resilience to overcome the disappointment of blowing their @entity181 chance , @entity175 hailed his skipper for grabbing the team by the scruff of the neck post – @entity22 and engineering the title - winning response			2
@entity21 powered to a 40 - 10 victory over @entity100 at @entity37 that won them the @entity7 title @entity19 beat @entity72 55 - 35 at @entity38 but it was n't enough to overhaul @entity21 ‘ you could see them starting to bounce back on thursday			1
i texted the players on tuesday and just said , “ training was n’t flash today but get a day ’s rest and let ’s start from scratch on thursday and really launch ourselves into this last challenge ” , ’ he said			0
that 24 - word missive had the desired effect			0
‘ you know when you ask something of them they are going to give it their very best shot			0
it ’s funny , we took a fair bit of confidence out of @entity213			0
‘ you give @entity22 a 12 - point head start , a @entity216 pack team , get to within four and really put pressure on them — that in its own way gave us a little bit of confidence even though we did n’t get the result			2
’ seven days later , that @entity181 - destroying outcome was forgotten			0
@entity21 were back - to - back champions for the first time in 66 years and their spontaneous celebrations , just like the calibre of their rugby , were anything but boring and anything but one dimensional .			1

@entity21 win @entity7 on points difference from @entity19 and @entity22
a 40 - 10 victory for @entity21 at @entity37 was enough to win the title
@entity1 coach @entity0 had called @entity4 rugby boring
@entity19 fell just short in their attempts to overhaul @entity21
