@entity0 is set to cash in on his notoriety as the killer of @entity3 by writing a book about the night he shot her and the sensational murder trial that followed , his manager has confirmed			1
news that the fallen @entity11 hero is planning his own memoir of the @entity14 tragedy will undoubtedly heap fresh anguish on the dead model 's already - tortured family			1
the book – which would almost certainly bring film offers in its wake – is thought to be the easiest way in which the @entity23 gold medalist can raise much - needed funds to settle his legal costs			1
he will be sentenced on october 13 with his sentencing hearing still a month away , @entity0 , 27 , is understood to have a shortfall in meeting bills submitted by his formidable legal team , even after liquidising his assets			1
and if the state go ahead with an appeal against conviction or sentence – which seems increasingly likely given the growing backlash since @entity0 was cleared of murder – he is under pressure to build ' a war chest ' to fund many more months or even years of legal battles			1
his manager and close confidant @entity46 told @entity47 that he and the track star had spent the months leading up to his murder trial fleshing out a book proposal			1
' he will write his own book , ' mr @entity46 confirmed			2
' we 've discussed it			0
we 've talked about ideas and concepts			0
' i will sit down with him once everything is done and decide what we are going to do			0
we have to wait until 13 october before we can think about anything			0
after that we will tell the world what we are going to do			2
' there has been a massive international reaction to @entity0 ' shock acquittal of the murder of his 29 - year - old girlfriend , who died when he fired four bullets at her through the locked door of a tiny lavatory cubicle			1
@entity72 , @entity0 ' manager , confirmed that they had sat down and discussed plans for the double - amputee to write a book about the night he shot and killed @entity3 judge @entity77 accepted @entity0 ' story that he fired repeatedly at the door , suspecting an intruder was behind it , and cleared him of murder judge @entity77 accepted @entity0 ' story that he fired repeatedly at the door , suspecting an intruder was behind it			1
he was cleared of murdering @entity85 but convicted of culpable homicide			1
he has been bailed until his sentencing , which was adjourned until october 13 , with many experts saying a jail sentence is unlikely			2
at the weekend , the sister of @entity91 - the wife of american football star @entity92 who was also dramatically cleared of her murder - drew her own painful parallels			1
@entity92 wrote the book if i did it after he was acquitted of the murders of @entity91 and @entity98 , who were killed in 1994			2
@entity99 wrote in @entity100 : ' the @entity0 case reminds me so much of what happened to @entity91			1
' we are seeing the same crimes , just different names , over and over again			0
' miss @entity3 's parents , june and @entity107 , were visibly emotional during the hearing on friday			2
june @entity3 condemned the handling of the trial , saying she did not believe @entity0 ' version of events following @entity0 ' sentence , @entity3 's mother , @entity113 , condemned the handling of the trial in an interview with @entity117			1
she said : ' i just do n't feel that this is the right sentence			0
they believe his story - and i do n't believe that story			0
' there were so many mistakes made			0
it did n't add up			0
' it was disbelief on our minds , it was disbelief on everyone in the world who has been following the case			0
' i really do n't what happens to @entity0			2
it 's not going to change anything because my daughter 's never coming back			0
' he 's still living and breathing			0
and she 's gone forever			0
