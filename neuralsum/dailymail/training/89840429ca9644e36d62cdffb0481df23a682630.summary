@entity1 privately urged @entity2 to back @entity5 ’s @entity4 takeover bid just weeks before the prime minister put him in charge of ruling on the issue , it emerged last night			2
in a bombshell email , the @entity9 lavished praise on the £ 8 billion bid			0
mr @entity1 said it would allow mr @entity5 ’s son @entity14 to create ‘ the world ’s first multi-platform media operator ’ and insisted that if it was blocked the ‘ media sector will suffer for years ’			1
controversial : @entity1 , left , was put in charge of dealing with @entity4 bid by @entity2 , right , after @entity20 lost the role the @entity22 will now face tough questions over why he gave mr @entity1 responsibility for the bid , despite knowing that he had been privately cheerleading for the @entity26			1
critics will also question the wisdom of mr @entity2 joining mr @entity5 and @entity30 chief executive @entity29 for a cosy @entity32 lunch just a month later where the bid was discussed			0
admission : @entity35 admitted his contacts with @entity37 were too close @entity38 led the charge against mr @entity1 today telling @entity40 the evidence of his wrongdoing was ' absolutely massive ' , arguing that instead of judging the @entity26 ’ bid , he was backing it			1
' there are two bits of evidence , actual straightforward evidence , that @entity1 was not impartial , he was meddling before he even took over the bid and was on the side of the @entity26 , ' she said			2
' the first was that he had to be warned off by the civil servants not to have any more meetings with @entity5 but he kept up the contact through his special adviser , and secondly he wrote a memo to the prime minister			0
' the @entity9 ’s message , revealed in evidence to the @entity61 inquiry into media standards yesterday , told mr @entity2 it would be ‘ totally wrong to cave in ’ to critics of the bid , including @entity40 director - general @entity64 , @entity65 and the @entity67 newspaper			1
mr @entity1 said @entity71 was ‘ pretty furious ’ that business secretary @entity20 had referred the bid to media regulator @entity73			1
he asked for a meeting with mr @entity2 , mr @entity20 and deputy prime minister @entity75 to discuss the handling of the deal			2
the disclosure appears directly to contradict mr @entity1 ’s insistence to mps last month that he had made ‘ absolutely no interventions seeking to influence a quasi-judicial decision that was at that time the responsibility of the secretary of state for business ’			1
it piles pressure on both mr @entity1 and mr @entity2 in the row over the government ’s handling of the @entity4 bid , which other media organisations argued would hand the @entity5 empire an unassailable dominance in @entity93			1
@entity94 admitted that the then cabinet secretary @entity95 was not made aware of the private message when he was asked to determine weeks later whether mr @entity1 could act as an impartial judge of the deal , given his previous statements of admiration for mr @entity5			1
mr @entity2 handed mr @entity1 responsibility for determining the bid after mr cable , who had previously been in charge of the issue , was caught on tape boasting that he had ‘ declared war ’ on @entity37			1
the @entity9 ’s representations had already been the subject of legal warnings from his own department , according to the counsel to the @entity61 inquiry , @entity114			0
revelations : mr @entity1 said @entity71 , left was ‘ pretty furious ’ that business secretary @entity20 , right , had referred the bid to media regulator @entity73 he said the @entity119 ’s legal director had advised that although it was not illegal for him to attempt to intervene , to do so would be ‘ unwise ’			1
a picture of the cosy relationship between the @entity5 empire and the department emerged at the inquiry yesterday , with evidence that @entity37 ’s chief lobbyist @entity127 exchanged more than 1,000 phone calls , emails and texts with the @entity9 ’s team during @entity37 ’s @entity4 takeover bid			0
most were to and from mr @entity1 ’s special adviser @entity35 , who has already had to quit , admitting his contacts with @entity37 went beyond what had been authorised by the @entity9			2
mr @entity127 and mr @entity1 became close after their wives both gave birth at @entity140 ’s @entity139 in may 2010			1
by october of that year , mr @entity127 was emailing mr @entity35 in connection with a @entity37 briefing memo for mr @entity1 on the @entity4 issues			1
mr @entity35 answered : ‘ @entity1 ’s response to this – “ persuasive ”			2
’ after @entity40 boss mr @entity64 used a speech to the @entity148 to raise concerns about @entity4 ’s dominance , mr @entity1 sent mr @entity127 a message saying : ‘ because he trains his guns on you , he failed to make his case to me			1
’ when he assumed responsibility for determining the bid in a ‘ quasi-judicial ’ fashion , mr @entity1 told mr @entity127 : ‘ all contact with me now needs to be through official channels until decision made			1
’ but the pair did exchange some text messages after this			0
after the @entity9 appeared in the @entity164 , and the @entity165 - born mr @entity127 texted to congratulate him , mr @entity1 replied : ‘ @entity166 ! large drink tonight			2
’ when the @entity37 lobbyist told mr @entity1 he had been ‘ very good ’ on @entity170 ’s @entity40 programme , to which he replied again : ‘ @entity166			1
’ in another text , the @entity9 said : ‘ @entity174 hopefully when consultation over we can have a coffee like the old days			0
’ in the key memo to the prime minister , dated november 19 , 2010 , mr @entity1 , who had spoken to @entity71 on the telephone a few days earlier , wrote : ‘ @entity71 is pretty furious at @entity20 ’s referral to @entity73			1
he does not think he will get a fair hearing from @entity73			0
’ he did add the caveat that it would be ‘ totally wrong ’ for the government to get involved in a competition issue , which should be decided at arms length			0
but he said : ‘ however , i do think you , i , @entity20 and the @entity186 should meet to discuss the policy issues that are thrown up as a result			0
’ government sources said the meeting never took place			0
mr @entity35 , giving evidence to the inquiry yesterday , was initially reluctant to concede that the @entity9 had backed the @entity5 bid from the outset			2
under lengthy questioning from mr @entity114 , he eventually admitted , however , that @entity1 ’s ‘ personal view ’ was in fact favourable			2
a @entity200 source said all the views expressed in the memo to mr @entity2 had already been put into the public domain by the @entity9 , including in newspaper interviews			0
@entity95 advised that what personal views he had previously expressed about the @entity26 , privately or publicly , was not the key point			0
it was about how he would conduct himself in the future , ’ the source said			0
a source close to mr @entity1 insisted he had not wanted to take on responsibility for the bid			1
‘ nobody did , ’ the source said			0
‘ you were either going to end up with every newspaper organisation in the land or the @entity5 empire hating you			0
‘ what @entity1 did at every stage was to bring in independent regulators to ensure this process was fair			0
he was well aware that his opinions on the bid would make people think that he was n’t handling it fairly			0
’ @entity38 , @entity227 ’s deputy leader said : ‘ it is clear that @entity1 was not the impartial arbiter he was required to be , and he should already have resigned			2

@entity38 says the evidence of @entity1 *'s* wrongdoing was ' absolutely massive '
' if we block it our media sector will suffer for years , ' mr @entity1 told him
the *document* also adds @entity71 was ' furious ' with @entity20 over his handling of the bid
a source close to mr @entity1 said the memo did not mean he could *n't* make an independent decision
