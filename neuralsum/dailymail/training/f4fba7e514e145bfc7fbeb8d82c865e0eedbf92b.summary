botched : @entity0 have criticsed the appointment of @entity2 as @entity5 's next @entity4 commissoner @entity7 ’s bid to secure a top job for @entity5 in the @entity9 was branded a ‘ shambles ’ last night after his controversial candidate was forced to sell his shares in a major lobbying company			1
@entity14 said @entity2 would sell what is thought to be a major shareholding in the lobbying giant @entity17 amid warnings in @entity19 that it would make his candidacy unacceptable			1
@entity0 said the move underlined the botched nature of lord @entity2 ’s appointment			1
shadow europe minister @entity25 said : ‘ @entity7 ’s approach to @entity27 goes from bad to worse			1
after his complete failure to stop @entity29 becoming @entity9 president this shambles will not help in rebuilding our influence to secure crucial reforms			0
’ he said @entity2 should now face confirmation hearings at @entity36 as well as in the @entity37			2
lord @entity2 , who was mr @entity7 ’s surprise choice to be @entity5 ’s next @entity4 commissioner , has spent his entire career in the revolving door between lobbying and politics			1
he and his @entity45 companies have spun for a string of foreign regimes , banks and big businesses , many of them with direct interests in @entity19			1
big name clients included the @entity54 , @entity55 and shamed welfare - to - work firm @entity56			0
@entity57 , the leader of the @entity58 of @entity59 , raised concerns about @entity2 ’s past as a lobbyist and his links to @entity17 , which is owned by mr @entity7 ’s @entity65 neighbour and constituency chairman @entity66			1
he said allowing lord @entity2 ’s appointment would be like ‘ letting the wolves into the sheep fold ’ – and suggested that the @entity37 could use its powers to block him			1
several senior @entity19 figures were also said to have raised concerns with @entity27 minister @entity74 in the 24 hours since lord @entity2 ’s nomination for the £ 210,000 - a - year job was announced			1
@entity14 insisted there was no conflict of interest , but said @entity2 wanted to make sure his confirmation hearings at the @entity37 were ‘ as smooth as possible ’ with ‘ no perceived conflict of interest ’			2
mr @entity57 said : ‘ there is no shame in having worked for the private sector			0
the question is conflicts of interest			0
if it comes to a hearing , someone with a past in lobbying can expect to be grilled with double the energy			0
we want to reduce the influence of lobbying and we do n’t want to let the wolves into the sheep fold			0
’ the president of the @entity37 warned that @entity2 could also be blocked because of his @entity102 views			2
in an extraordinary snub , @entity105 socialist @entity103 , who is a key ally of mr @entity29 , said he could not rule out @entity2 being rejected			2
‘ i ca n’t imagine that @entity2 , with his radical @entity108 views , which he is supposed to have , will get a majority in the @entity37 , ’ he said			0
while the parliament can not vote against individual commissioners it can reject their suitability as a whole , leading to nominees perceived as weak being rejected			0
shambles : shadow europe minister @entity25 ( left ) said @entity7 ’s approach to @entity27 has gone ' from bad to worse ' follwing his failure to stop @entity29 ( right ) becoming @entity9 president this morning mr @entity7 will hold his first face - to - face talks with mr @entity29 since his failed bid to stop the federalist former prime minister of @entity123 becoming president of the @entity9			1
the prime minister will seek a top economic job for @entity2 – either trade , competition or responsibility for the @entity4 ’s single market – despite the controversy surrounding his candidacy			2
but experts warned that his decision to send a low - profile candidate – partly because of a reluctance to spark a by - election – could count against @entity5 , when other countries are nominating much more senior ministers			0
@entity140 , director of the think tank @entity141 , described it as a gamble			0
lord @entity2 was backed by newly - appointed defence minister @entity144 , who said he was ‘ one of the most effective political operators we ’ve got ’			2
mr @entity144 acknowledged that the reshuffle had given the @entity148 a more @entity102 edge , but said this was in tune with public opinion .			0
