knowing he will be armed with a massive budget for team strengthening at the end of the season , the @entity13 manager attended @entity19 ’s @entity18 semi-final with @entity21 at the @entity22 , in an attempt to narrow down a long list of candidates to bolster his side in all areas			1
@entity29 understands the two players under closest review were highly - rated centre - back @entity32 and his @entity19 team - mate @entity34			2
in addition , @entity5 has also been alerted to the form of @entity21 ’s on - loan left - back @entity37 and was keen to see him in action			1

@entity5 has long been linked with @entity93 left - back @entity75 and is closing in on @entity82 ’s @entity81 , as revealed in @entity29			0
but as a contingency plan , he is keeping an eye on the form of @entity37 , who is on loan at @entity21 from @entity98 .			0
