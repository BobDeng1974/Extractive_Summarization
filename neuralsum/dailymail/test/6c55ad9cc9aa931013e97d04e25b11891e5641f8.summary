@entity0 was in confident mood after safely moving through to the second round of the @entity3 in @entity4			1
@entity0 led 7 - 2 overnight and many thought he would make light work of @entity7 but he was made to battle before eventually securing a 10 - 6 victory			1
the 25 - year - old closed with a century and will now face @entity10 in the next round			1
@entity0 beat @entity7 10 - 6 on thursday in the first round of the @entity3 ' i 'm just going to focus on my own game , ' he told @entity15			1
' if i play how i know i can , i 'll win it			0
' a re-rack was required in the 10th frame but that did not distract @entity7 who produced a break of 97 to reduce the gap to four			2
@entity0 took the next with a streak of 74 but a 74 of his own from @entity7 followed by a run of 70 in the next meant it was 8 - 5 at the interval			1
@entity7 got amongst the balls after the interval but was halted at 24 and @entity0 swept in with a 76 to move within one frame of victory			1
@entity30 potter @entity7 showed his mettle , though , with a 99 in the next before a closing 109 from @entity0 put an end to his campaign			1
and the 2011 finalist was quick to praise his opponent , who was making his @entity37 debut			0
@entity0 ( pictured ) led 7 - 2 from wednesday and got the job done despite a good display by @entity7 ' he played really well considering it 's his first time here , ' he said			1
' second session he hardly missed a ball			0
he probably wo n't take as much credit as he would if it was a top player making those breaks			0
' he played as good as anyone i 've seen first time here			0
' @entity0 is one of the crowd favourites wherever he plays and admits there is a weight of expectation on him this year			2
' there 's obviously a lot of anticipation this year , ' he added			2
' my results have shown that i 'm playing some good stuff , i felt like i played well over the past two days			0
' there 's obviously a few things i need to work on but other than that i feel very confident			2
' it was nice for @entity7 to play as he did , it just shows there is always stuff to work on and you wo n't get many sessions where someone plays that well			2
' after being five frames behind , @entity7 closed the gap to three before @entity0 earned the victory at the press conference following his win , @entity0 was asked about the footwear problems encountered by long - time rival @entity75 , whose 10 - 3 victory over @entity77 required a change of shoes			1
having started tuesday 's match in a new pair of shoes , @entity75 discarded them due to the acute discomfort they were causing him ; he briefly played in socks before accepting tournament director @entity87 's shoes which ' felt great ' to him			0
of the incident , @entity0 said : ' i did n't really see it but i heard about it			2
obviously , he likes attention			0
i do n't know if he 's done it on purpose or not , who knows ? ' as to the overall favourite for the @entity3 , @entity0 was quick to divert attention away from @entity75 , adding : ' in my eyes , i think @entity101 's ( @entity100 ) probably the underdog , @entity75 was forced into borrowing a pair of shoes from tournament director @entity87 ' i think @entity101 's favourite to win the tournament			1
@entity101 and @entity106 ( @entity107 ) are going to be the toughest two			0
@entity75 is obviously a good player but i 'm confident of beating anyone			0
' on the other table , defending champion @entity107 was locked in a tough battle with @entity111 in the opening second round match			2
@entity107 , who needed to scrap for a 10 - 9 win over @entity114 in the first round , got off to a slow start as he surrendered the first two frames			1
the first was a scrappy encounter but a break of 63 sealed the second for @entity111 before runs of 51 and 46 saw @entity107 on the board			0
the @entity125 cueman then levelled things up at the mid-session interval with a 65 and an 87 at the third time of asking saw him edge ahead			0
defending champion @entity107 closed the session at 4 - 4 with @entity111 in their second round match @entity111 was not daunted , though , and breaks of 74 and 73 in the next two saw him take a 4 - 3 lead before @entity107 drew level again to end the session at 4 - 4			2
@entity136 , the 2005 world champion and current @entity138 title holder , conceded just the one additional frame to his overnight lead of 7 - 2 as he wrapped up a 10 - 3 win over @entity142			1
@entity136 's first frame on thursday was a tight affair at 56 - 55 and he went on to win the next 64 - 33			0
@entity146 's @entity145 was able to pick up frame 12 but @entity136 's wrapped up the contest with a break of 111			0

@entity159 had picked up back - to - back frames at the start without much fuss , including 81 on the first , though @entity157 's class showed in a 135 break in the third			0
four - time @entity3 winner @entity159 then threatened to walk away with the match by winning three frames on the bounce , starting with 116 - 6 in the fourth and going on to lead 5 - 1			1
however , @entity157 fought back in the closing stages to narrow the deficit , though he did miss out on a second century break of the match after failing to pot the black , on what was to prove the last shot of the day .			0
