the captain of the cruise ship @entity2 which sank off the @entity4 island of @entity5 in 2012 killing 32 people has been sentenced to 16 years in jail for manslaughter			1
@entity9 , dubbed ' captain coward ' after he fled the ship before the 4,200 passengers were safely ashore , was handed the sentence this evening in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the 54 - year - old was given ten years for manslaughter , five for causing a shipwreck , one for abandoning ship , and a further month for giving false information to port authorities			1
his lawyers had launched a last - minute appeal yesterday attempting to blame the rest of the crew for the accident , but their attempts failed			2
but despite the guilty verdict today , @entity28 remains a free man and still has the right to two legal appeals which can take years to process , meaning he may never see the inside of a cell			1
he tried to argue he fell into a lifeboat by accident the verdict and sentencing brought an end to a trial that has been running since july 2013			1
@entity28 was commanding the vessel , a floating hotel as long as three football pitches , when it came too close to shore and hit rocks off the @entity15 holiday island of @entity62			1
he was charged with multiple manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship in one of the highest - profile shipping disasters in recent years			1
earlier the court had heard that @entity28 was a ' reckless idiot ' who had been showing off to a waiter on board the ship , and a friend on @entity62 , when he steered the ship close to the shore on the night of january 13			1
witnesses said @entity28 had escaped the stricken vessel before all passengers had left , and when the arrived shivering on shore , they saw him standing there ' without even getting his feet wet '			2
judges were also told that after the ship hit rocks , causing a tear in its hull which caused it to tip over on one side , the evacuation was delayed chaotic			1
some of the ship 's lifeboats were not deployed , while few instructions were given by the crew , judges heard			2
the former captain 's lawyers had argued that he delayed the evacuation because of the wind conditions , and did not use some of the lifeboats as they had not taken part in an inspection several months previous			2
@entity28 , pictured yesterday as the guilty verdict is read out , was not at his sentencing today			2
his lawyers claimed he was suffering from a fever , despite him making an impassioned plea earlier in the day passengers flee the @entity2 as the ship begins to list on the night of january 13 , 2012			1
@entity28 later admitted he was showing off when he sailed the vessel so close to rocks on @entity62 they also tried to argue that the captain had fallen into a lifeboat , rather than fleeing , but video from the vessel seemed to show him waiting calmly in line before climbing on board			1
a panel of three judges found @entity28 guilty of manslaughter and sentenced him to 16 years and one month in jail			1
after seven hours consideration judges emerged through red velvet curtains from backstage at the theatre @entity126			0
@entity28 was not in court for the verdict although earlier in the day he had made an impassioned appeal			2
his lawyers said he was at his apartment with a fever			2
he was also ordered to pay court costs and was banned from public office for life			0
he was banned for five years from being at the command of a ship			2
each of the 110 civil plaintiffs , crammed into a theatre where the trial is being held to accommodate them , will receive 30,000 euros ( £ 23,000 ) each , while 300,000 euros ( £ 230,000 ) will go to the island of @entity62 and the region of @entity15			0
@entity144 , a lawyer representing a @entity146 couple who survived and the estate of a @entity148 who died , said : ' something is missing in this trial of @entity28			1
it is incomplete because , in our view , other responsibilities , beyond his , emerged			0
' mr @entity144 said an emergency diesel generator did n't work , elevators did n't shut down for safety reasons during the disaster , and some crew did n't speak @entity4 - the ship 's working language - while others barely spoke @entity164			0
judges at the court in @entity14 read out @entity28 's sentence this evening			2
however it is far from certain he will see jail , as he is entitled to two legal appeals which could take years to process the @entity2 was travelling close to @entity40 when it hit rocks which ripped a whole in its side , causing the vessel to capsize and starting a panicked late - night evacuation the lawyer joined others in a network called ' justice for the @entity9 ' , insisting cruise line firm @entity181 's board of directors should have been held equally responsible			1
mr @entity144 added : ' we did n't have those people in the dock			0
people did n't die because the ship hit the rocks , they perished because they were n't helped in the emergency			1
' the company was fined 1 million euros in 2013 by a judge in @entity15			0
hours before the verdict @entity28 's lawyers made a last - ditch attempt to blame the disaster on his own crew - living up to his nickname of captain @entity199			1
lawyer @entity200 told the court in @entity14 that prosecutors had built their case ' around one person , not the facts ' , and mr @entity28 believed he was being made a scapegoat for wider failings			2
@entity28 's lawyers denied he acted like a ' reckless idiot ' when the @entity9 smashed into a reef when sailing too close to the @entity15 island of @entity62 on july 27 , 2014			1
investigators severely criticised his handling of the disaster , accusing him of bringing the 290 metre - long vessel too close to shore amid claims he was ' saluting ' those on the shore			0
@entity28 's lawyers had attempted a last - minute legal appeal , attempting to blame the rest of the crew for the accident , but it was unsuccessful the disaster triggered a chaotic night evacuation of more than 4,000 passengers and crew and left 32 people dead			1
survivors spoke of their shock of seeing the skipper standing on the shore after the disaster without even getting his feet wet			0
prosecutors had asked for a sentence of 26 years in prison for @entity28 , who admitted some responsibility as captain of the ship but denied blame for deaths that occurred during the evacuation			1
passenger @entity241 , 23 , a dancer from @entity243 , @entity244 , said he was ‘ happy ’ with the outcome			0
‘ when the ship started to sink , extreme panic set in and i thought i was going to die , ’ he added			0
‘ people started to jump into the water and i did the same and managed to get to the shore			0
‘ when i got home , i was very withdrawn , in shock and disbelief			0
’ another dancer @entity254 , 33 , from @entity255 , has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder			0
‘ it felt like a horrible nightmare , ’ she said			0
