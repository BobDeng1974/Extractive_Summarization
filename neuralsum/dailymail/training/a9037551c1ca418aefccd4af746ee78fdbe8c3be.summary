a nine - year - old boy with a brain tumour told there was ' no hope ' has defied expectations to beat cancer for the second time - just in time for @entity6			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , was first diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in february 2012 , when he was just six years old			1
after undergoing two major operations , radiotherapy and months of chemotherapy , scans showed he was cancer - free and his family believed he had beat the disease			1
but they were hit with another bombshell in july this year , when they were told his cancer had returned			1
doctors broke the heartbreaking news that there was ' no hope ' , but his family begged them to continue treatment			1
@entity26 : @entity7 ( front ) has been given the all - clear from cancer in time for @entity6 , much to the relief of his mother @entity31 , brother @entity33 ( left ) and and twin brother @entity32 due to mrs @entity35 ' insistence , @entity7 received treatment and was taking chemotherapy tablets at home			1
three months later , to their utter relief , a scan has revealed @entity7 has defied medics - as the tumour seems to have disappeared			1
he is now looking forward to spending @entity6 day with his twin brother @entity32 , his two older brothers , @entity44 , 11 , and @entity33 , 12 , and his parents @entity46 and @entity48			0
mrs @entity35 , 33 , said @entity7 has just finished his fourth round of chemotherapy and the family will spoil the youngster this @entity6 after such a traumatic year			1
' we were devastated when the doctors told us the cancer had come back , ' she said			2
' @entity7 had been clear for over two years and we could not believe it			2
it is such a relief to hear the tumour has gone once again			0
' we thought there would be a little bit of shrinkage following the chemotherapy , but we did n't expect the tumour to be totally gone			2
' now we can really celebrate @entity6 without the worry of thinking about it			0
all the boys are going to be extra spoilt this year			0
' @entity7 will still have to undergo two further courses of chemotherapy at @entity68 , which will finish in march , but doctors have dropped his regular scans from every three months to every six months			1
mrs @entity35 has also thanked a number of friends , family and well - wishers that helped raise money to pay for treatment , and for items on @entity7 's wish list , such as a petrol buggy			2
she and her husband were completely devastated when @entity7 was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2012			1
brotherly love : @entity7 ( left ) with his twin , @entity32			0
the youngster has just finished his fourth round of chemotherapy and the family are looking forward to celebrating this @entity6 after suffering intense headaches , and doctors ruling out various causes , he was eventually sent for a scan			2
his parents were devastated to be told he had a particularly fast - growing tumour called a grade 4 glioblastoma			0
according to @entity98 , only about 20 in 100 children ( 20 per cent ) diagnosed with glioblastoma will live for five years			0
a glioblastoma is an aggressive and fast - growing form of brain tumour			1
fast growing tumours are much more likely to come back after treatment than slow growing tumours			0
the outlook is not good for people with more aggressive grade 3 and 4 tumours			0
only about 20 in 100 children ( 20 per cent ) diagnosed with glioblastoma will live for five years			0
many adults live for less than a year			0
source : @entity98 despite the poor odds , @entity7 underwent two major operations as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
his parents were delighted to hear the treatment had kept the cancer at bay			2
months of regular scans came back clear , and they believed they could breathe a sigh of relief			0
however , another headache he suffered in july this year rang alarm bells , and further tests showed the tumour had returned			1
following the chemotherapy tablets and a recent scan , @entity7 's consultant in paediatric oncology , dr @entity132 , confirmed the tumour seemed to have disappeared , although he would have to continue his chemotherapy until the course is complete			1
dr @entity135 said : ' this is really great news for @entity7 and his family			0
' we 're really pleased that the tumour seems to have responded so well to the chemotherapy treatment , and while not out of the woods just yet , this response to chemotherapy is much better than i expected			2
' mrs @entity35 added : ' i could not thank the staff at @entity68 enough			0
they are all really good with @entity7			0
