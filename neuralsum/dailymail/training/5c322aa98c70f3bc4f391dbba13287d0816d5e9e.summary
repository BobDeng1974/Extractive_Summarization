by @entity0 @entity1 has urged @entity2 to ' throw caution to the wind ' in thursday night 's must - win @entity6 clash with @entity8 , but warned they must learn the defensive lessons from the loss to @entity11			1
the @entity13 and @entity2 legend says @entity14 was too attacking in saturday night 's opener in @entity16 and should have concentrated on a strong defensive performance to avoid defeat			1
but after @entity20 's second - half winner left @entity2 's hopes of reaching the last 16 in the balance , @entity14 has been left with little alternative but to go for it against the @entity24			1
must win : former @entity2 defender @entity1 says @entity14 's team must improve defensively if they are to stand a chance of beating @entity8 and stay in the @entity6 international duty : @entity1 playing for @entity2 against @entity28 in the @entity30 quarter - final			1
@entity1 won 66 caps for @entity2 , scoring five times former centre - half @entity1 , who won 66 caps for his country , told @entity36 : ' the one massive negative from the night was that we were too positive			1
' at times we did the @entity40 thing and went in with our hearts over our heads			0
we had a fixation with having a go and @entity14 had 65m @entity2 fans screaming for them to attack			2
' i thought we were a bit naive , trying to win the @entity6 in the first 20 minutes			0
i 'm all in favour of being positive and going forward but only if we have a solid defensive unit			0
' we should have worked more on the back four and @entity51 and @entity52 in front of them and prioritised trying to keep a clean sheet			0
' grounded : @entity55 is left slumped on the floor and @entity57 in the net as @entity20 scores @entity11 's winner against @entity2 in saturday 's @entity6 opener do or die : @entity14 knows @entity2 must do everything they can to win against @entity8 @entity8 are not the same proposition as @entity11 , as shown by their shock 3 - 1 defeat to @entity65 , but with @entity67 star @entity66 returning from injury , they have the ability to unlock @entity2 's defence			1
@entity1 said : ' there is extreme pressure on both @entity2 and @entity8 - this is a knockout tie			1
' @entity2 will want to go forward and impress but they need to keep a clean sheet			0
@entity74 and @entity75 need to stay back and stay focused otherwise @entity66 will expose them			0
' much of the discussion in the days in between the two fixtures has focused on @entity79 's place and position in the team but @entity1 says others can play the no 10 role			2
' if @entity79 plays , he should be in the no 10 role but there are lots of options			0
personally , i would have liked to have seen @entity89 up there having a go , ' @entity1 said			2
mixed bag : @entity79 helped set up @entity2 's goal , scored by @entity94 , but otherwise endured a frustrating evening out on the left wing against @entity11 impact : @entity1 would like to see @entity89 given an opportunity to impress against @entity8 coming for you : @entity66 is fit again and determined to knock @entity2 out of the @entity6 ' people are over the top with @entity79 - what 's wrong with taking him off after 60 minutes and letting someone else have a go ? ' i 'd also back @entity105 in that no 10 role			1
we do also have plenty of people to open up @entity8 with pace and quality - @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity94			2
' because of the result in the first game , we need to throw caution to the wind			0
all things considered , we should win			0
' teenage kicks : @entity113 was impressive against @entity11 and @entity2 will need another strong performance from the @entity67 tyro shining light : @entity123 celebrates his splendid solo goal against @entity125 in the @entity126 with the first round of group stage matches completed and all 32 teams observed , @entity1 is sticking with his pre-tournament prediction of an @entity132 win			1
@entity123 's side were n't at their best in the 2 - 1 win over @entity125 but with @entity136 and @entity137 to come , are well on their way to the last 16			1
' i tipped @entity132 before the @entity6 and i hope @entity123 can inspire them to win because he 's the best player i 've ever seen			2
' he can never be up there with the likes of @entity142 and @entity143 until he lifts the @entity6			0
' @entity1 was talking tactics at @entity145 and @entity147 shopping centres			0

@entity2 's defensive *weaknesses* were exposed in 2 - 1 defeat to @entity11 in @entity6 opener
must now beat @entity8 in @entity153 to remain in the tournament
@entity13 and @entity2 legend @entity1 says @entity2 must be more solid at the back
believes @entity89 can make an impact late on if @entity2 have n't scored
