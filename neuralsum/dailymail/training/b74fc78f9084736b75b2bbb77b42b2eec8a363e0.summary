by @entity1 reporter published : 01:58 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 03:35 est , 10 december 2013 narrowly beating a midnight deadline , @entity2 voted on monday to renew an expiring ban on plastic firearms that can evade airport detection machines			1
but @entity7 blocked an effort to toughen the restrictions - the latest defeat for gun - control forces in the year since the grade school massacre in @entity13 , @entity14			1
president @entity15 signed the law before midnight , using an auto pen as he traveled to @entity18 for ceremonies honoring the late @entity21 president @entity20			1
racing a midnight deadline , the @entity22 gave final congressional approval on monday evening to a 10 - year extension of the prohibition against guns that can slip past metal detectors and x-ray machines the device @entity15 used to sign the bill has been used for the signatures of traveling presidents since the administration of president @entity35			1
by voice vote , the @entity22 gave final congressional approval to a 10 - year extension of the prohibition against guns that can slip past metal detectors and x-ray machines			2
the @entity41 voted last week for an identical decade - long renewal of the ban			2
@entity7 senators rejected an effort by sen. @entity46 , @entity47 , to strengthen the ban by requiring that such weapons contain un-detachable metal parts			1
some plastic guns meet the letter of the current law with a metal piece that can be removed , making them a threat to be slipped past security screeners at schools , airports and elsewhere			1
undetectable : authorities are concerned that plastic @entity63 guns could be brought into places such as schools or government buildings where metal detectors would n't find them sen. @entity69 of @entity70 , top @entity7 on the @entity71 , said @entity2 should extend the ban for a decade and study @entity46 's more restrictive plan to make sure it does n't interfere with technologies used by legitimate gun manufacturers			1
he said the bill 's recent introduction suggests that ‘ the real objectives were things other than just getting an extension			0
’ at a news conference later , @entity46 said he had ‘ no ulterior motive ’ in proposing to strengthen the ban and said he hoped to find compromise with @entity69 in coming weeks			2
‘ the bottom line is technology advances and it does good things and it does bad things , ’ he said			0
underscoring the issue 's political sensitivity , both of monday 's votes were on unanimous consent requests			0
that meant any single senator could scuttle the proposals by objecting			0
it also meant the votes were by voice and that no individual senators ' votes were recorded			0
for a handful of @entity105 senators seeking re-election next year in @entity7 - leaning states , the day 's votes could have been difficult			1
president @entity15 signed the law before midnight , using an auto pen as he traveled to @entity18 for ceremonies honoring the late @entity21 president @entity20 the @entity111 , which has been instrumental in blocking gun restrictions , expressed no opposition to renewing the law			1
but the gun lobby said it would fight any expanded requirements , including @entity46 's , ‘ that would infringe on our second amendment rights ’ to bear arms			0
the rejection of stricter curbs highlighted the repeated setbacks for gun - control advocates in @entity2 since last dec. 14			0
on that day , a gunman fatally shot 20 first - graders and six staff members at @entity126 before killing himself			2
despite that - and other recent mass shootings , including at the @entity129 just blocks from the @entity131 - supporters of expanded gun control are nearing the end of a year in which they have been unable to push any new firearms restrictions through @entity2			2
‘ we 're several decades behind the @entity111 , ’ said sen. @entity137 , @entity138 ‘ this is a long game , and it 's going to take us some time to build up the resources necessary to compete			0
’ it is almost a year since a gunman fatally shot 20 first - graders and six staff members at @entity126 before killing himself congressional @entity7 have resisted tightening the restrictions against undetectable guns , but those lawmakers - as well as the @entity111 - have not opposed renewing the current prohibition			1
the @entity41 approved a 10 - year extension last week			2
plastic guns were in their infancy when president @entity152 and @entity2 first enacted the ban against undetectable firearms , and when it was renewed in 1998 and 2003			1
but such weapons have become a growing threat and can now be produced by 3 - d printers , which are becoming better and more affordable			1
supporters of tightening the rules say the 10 - year renewal helps the gun lobby because it reduces @entity105 ' ability to revisit the issue			0
the @entity126 killings prompted @entity15 and @entity105 to make gun control a top domestic priority this year - but to no avail in @entity2			1
their most stinging loss occurred in april , when the @entity22 turned aside an effort to expand federal background checks for would - be gun purchasers , an effort to prevent criminals and mentally ill people from getting weapons			2
sen. @entity46 , @entity47 , center , and sen. @entity179 , @entity180 , arrive to talk to reporters about their effort to renew the ban on plastic firearms that can evade airport detection machines , at the @entity131 in @entity185 on monday that measure would have required the checks for all sales at gun shows and online - expanding a system that is currently required only for sales through licensed firearms dealers			1
also defeated were proposed bans on assault weapons and large - capacity ammunition magazines.in a measure of @entity7 opposition and @entity111 clout , those proposals never even came to votes in the @entity7 - majority @entity41			1
but with saturday 's @entity13 anniversary approaching , rep. @entity201 , @entity202 , a psychologist , plans to announce legislation on thursday aimed at boosting federal mental health programs , including treatment , research and training for workers who respond to emergencies			0
the lack of movement in the @entity105 - led @entity22 has left gun - control groups divided about their 2014 goals			0
some are willing to set aside , for now , the push for expanded background checks and settle for more modest changes			0
by voice vote , the @entity22 gave final congressional approval to a 10 - year extension of the prohibition against guns that can slip past metal detectors and x-ray machines on monday night these could include strengthening mental health programs and having states provide more records to the federal background check system			2
backing this approach are some @entity13 families and the group @entity232 , formed by former rep. @entity233 , @entity234 , seriously wounded by a shooter , and her husband , former astronaut @entity236			0
others want to continue raising pressure on lawmakers to back strong background check requirements , and they oppose aiming for less			0
these groups include @entity242 , led by outgoing @entity244 mayor @entity243 , an organization that has been spending money against gun - rights congressional candidates and lawmakers			0
these groups are concerned that @entity7 would use votes for weaker efforts to cast themselves as having championed major steps against guns .			0
