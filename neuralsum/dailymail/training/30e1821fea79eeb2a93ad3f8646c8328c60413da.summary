the @entity0 is set to lose funding worth millions of pounds a year thanks to a republican snub by @entity5 ’s @entity4 government			2
in a move that threatens an explosive cross-border row , @entity7 ministers have signalled they will refuse to contribute to the costs of running the @entity11			1
a deal to hand new devolved powers to @entity7 after september ’s referendum on independence will effectively rob the @entity16 of more than £ 2 million in cash a year			1
with the first formal meeting between new first minister ms @entity5 and the @entity0 just three days away , the move threatens to provoke a major rift between the @entity33 and the @entity11			2
ms @entity5 ’s calculated snub will also strain the fraught relationship between the governments in @entity37 and @entity38			0
@entity39 said the first minister ’s refusal to pay @entity7 ’s share for the @entity11 showed the @entity4 ’s ‘ narrow ’ view of the world , while the @entity45 accused the nationalists of deliberately trying to ‘ undermine ’ @entity7 ’s strong links with the @entity29			1
ms @entity5 has a history as a strong @entity49 , having boycotted a visit by the @entity0 to the @entity51 in 2003 and also deliberately making her oath of allegiance in the @entity51 to the sovereignty of the people , not the @entity56 , when she was elected in 1999			0
after the @entity4 lost the referendum on independence in september , @entity57 asked @entity60 of @entity61 to draw up a list – with cross-party approval – of powers that should be devolved from @entity65 to the @entity51			1
the @entity33 will take control of the property and land in @entity7 , under new powers devolved to them under the @entity71 report , including sites such as @entity73 on the @entity74 ( pictured ) when the @entity71 ’s report was published last month , it transferred control to the @entity51 of all the @entity7 assets of the @entity78			1
this means the @entity33 will take control of the property and land in @entity7 previously owned on behalf of the @entity84 state , as well as control of @entity7 ’s coastline , including mineral and fishing rights and the revenue from offshore wind farms			0
however , the move also directly affects the queen ’s income , because the @entity78 plays a vital role in funding the @entity11			1
other assets belonging to the @entity78 transferred to the @entity51 , which were previously owned on behalf of the @entity84 state , include dowsing offshore wind farm in the @entity97 ( pictured ) the @entity78 , throughout the whole of the @entity84 , makes about £ 240 million profit every year			1
at the moment , these profits are handed to the @entity102			0
the @entity11 receives a ‘ sovereign grant ’ equivalent to 15 per cent of the profits			2
currently , this agreement means the @entity16 receive about £ 36 million a year			0
the @entity71 report said the ‘ management of the @entity78 ’s economic assets in @entity7 and the revenue generated by those assets ’ should be transferred to the control of the @entity51			1
@entity7 will also be given control of its coastline , including mineral and fishing rights , under new powers devolved to the @entity51			2
here an angler fishes for salmon at the @entity119 , @entity120 as a result , the profits of the residual @entity78 in @entity122 and @entity123 will shrink – as will the 15 per cent share given to the @entity0			2
when the profits from the @entity78 ’s assets in @entity7 are taken away , the residual @entity78 will lose £ 14 million a year – and the @entity0 will lose about £ 2.1 million annually			1
instead of going to the @entity102 , the cash from @entity7 will go straight into @entity33 coffers			0
crucially lord @entity60 ’s report made it clear that a new deal would have to be put in place to ensure the @entity0 ’s existing funding remained in place			0
he stated : ‘ responsibility for financing the sovereign grant will need to reflect this revised settlement for the @entity78			0
’ however , ms @entity5 has apparently decided that she will not be sending any @entity141 money south to make up the shortfall – and expects the @entity102 to pick up the tab from general taxation			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity33 said : ‘ the level of funding the @entity0 receives from the @entity102 under the sovereign grant is set by reference to 15 per cent of the @entity78 ’s profits and does not come from @entity78 profits themselves			0
' with 71 per cent of taxes paid in @entity7 continuing to be controlled by the @entity102 , @entity7 will continue to make the same contribution to the @entity29 through general taxes			1
’ publicly , @entity152 would only say yesterday that they expected the @entity78 in @entity7 to continue to play some part in funding the @entity11			1
a spokesman for the @entity155 said : ‘ officials from the @entity102 and @entity78 will work with the @entity157 to determine exactly how funding will work in the new @entity141			0
’ but privately , it is understood that senior ministers in @entity161 and the @entity102 are very unhappy with ms @entity5 ’s approach			0
they believe that ms @entity5 ’s dogmatic and unilateral approach has undermined much of the trust built up through the @entity71 process			0
a spokesman for the @entity39 said : ‘ the fact the @entity4 are saying they ’ll make no contribution from their future @entity78 income illustrates their narrow view of the world			1
‘ it should make for an interesting conversation when @entity5 has her first audience with the @entity0 next week			0
’ @entity7 conservative deputy leader @entity175 added : ‘ despite all their assurances about the future of the @entity29 in @entity7 , it seems @entity4 ministers intend to grab all the income from the @entity78 at the first opportunity			1
’ a spokesman for @entity157 said : ‘ implementation of the @entity71 ’s findings , including those related to @entity78 assets in @entity7 , are a matter for the two governments and parliaments			2

ministers signal they wo *n't* contribute to cost of running the @entity11
move comes as part of deal to hand over devolved powers to @entity7
@entity4 plans to reap cash benefits of deal – while refusing to fund monarchy
both @entity39 and the @entity45 round on @entity4 's ' narrow ' view of the world
@entity78 's profits will be down £ *14million* a year after ' assets grab '
@entity7 says ' we *'ll* fund monarchy to usual amount by general taxes '
