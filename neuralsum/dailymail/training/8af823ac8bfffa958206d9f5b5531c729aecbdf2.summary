retired @entity18 police officer @entity9 collected $ 470,395.20 over 26 years , the most money over the longest period of time accoring to prosecutors			1
assistant district attorney @entity22 said @entity9 was one of the worst abusers , posting videos of himself performing martial arts on @entity26 and traveling on at least 18 flights between 2006 and 2013 all while claiming he was too depressed to leave his house , travel or work			2
@entity9 was extradited from his home of @entity32 , @entity11 where he owns @entity33 and lives in an upscale gated neighborhood called ' @entity35 '			1
while the 16 other defendants were processed in groups of three and four and released without bail , @entity9 was singled out and had to post $ 20,000 to walk			1
a lead instructor at his martial arts school was shocked to hear of @entity9 's arrest , describing him as a ' very honest person '			1
having his cake and eating it too : @entity9 also brought a home $ 470,395 illegally from @entity46 payouts luxury : @entity9 was arrested at his home in an upscale gated @entity11 community last week ' it 's having an effect on me as his student , as a man , as a father , as a human being			1
it 's tremendously devastating at this moment , ' instructor @entity58 told @entity59			0
@entity9 , who is called ' @entity60 ' at the school ' , boasts on the website that he is a sixth degree black belt who has served as a body guard for ' numerous dignitaries and celebrities ' including @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			1
he says that his program has a positive influence on children and he takes pride in ' training and developing tomorrow 's leaders , on @entity79 at a time ! ' while claiming disability , @entity9 brazenly appeared in videos online performing martial arts			1
in one video , he fights off opponents with ' @entity86 ' blasting in the background			0
he also posted on his @entity88 about looking forward to his 115 precinct reunion , which is scheduled to take place on a cruise this may			0
following the charges , he may no longer be welcome to that reunion			0
well enough to fight : @entity9 ( in black ) brazenly performed in marital arts performances while claiming thousands of dollars in disability insurance devastating : @entity58 , a lead instructor at the martial arts facility owned by @entity9 , says he was shocked to hear of his boss 's arrest resume : on the karate school 's website , @entity9 boasts of serving as a body guard for celebrities like @entity68 and @entity71 more than 100 first responders who claimed to have psychiatric conditions and medical disorders because of their work at @entity107 were arrested last week for disability fraud			1
some of the retired police officers , firefighters and corrections officers stole money from the 9/11 disability fund , while others like @entity9 had been stealing money from the pension fund for more than two decades			1
the arrests come after the @entity119 's office spent more than two years investigating the claims made by some @entity122 officers and firemen who were part of the september 11 response and clean up efforts			1
the officers submitted forms saying that they had varying disorders like @entity130 , anxiety or depression - claims which were discovered to have falsified			2
@entity59 7 reports that many of the retired officers that had said that they were being treated for stress retained their gun licenses , which is not allowed if the holder has such a condition			2
another tip off was that in order to receive the benefits , the individuals had to be fully retired and while the majority of them had retired from the @entity148 police and fire departments , many had taken up a second job			0
investigators used photos on @entity88 as evidence that the men have taken up jobs ranging from martial arts instructors to helicopter pilots			0
some photos directly contradicted specific parts of the disorders that the responding officers claimed to have			1
tag team : @entity163 ( left ) , a @entity165 consultant , or @entity166 ( right ) , a retired member of the @entity122 , would refer the fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme law on their side : @entity174 , 83 , was one of those two lawyers who then helped process the legal papers which allowed the schemers to get on average between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000 per year - with a nice cut for each of the ringleaders responding to horror : more than a hundred first responders who helped at @entity107 following the 2001 terrorist attack are being arrested over disability fraud after making false claims of ptsd and depression sending a message : @entity188 is pictured on a jet ski , clearly not as incapacitated as he claimed to be in his benefit filing proud : @entity191 , 42 , now lives in @entity192 , @entity11 but was claiming disability insurance from the fund not so afraid of crowds now : @entity196 , who said his post- 9/11 fear of crowds kept him from working , collected $ 108,930 in payments and is seen here selling cannolis at the packed @entity202 festival the individuals ' claims - whether they be depression or assertions that they felt unable to spend time with family and friends in social settings - have not been revealed - but the @entity119 's office released a set of photos that depict some of the men in question having a great time on jet skis or marlin fishing as examples of their fraudulent claims			1
one instance came from an officer , whose name has not been released , that told authorities that his work after the september 11th attacks left him with a debilitating fear of crowds			0
on @entity88 , he was pictured selling canollis at the crowded @entity231 in @entity232			0
the suspicion is that there were a handful of ' crooked ' lawyers and doctors who worked with the responders in question and were fully aware of how to ' game the system '			0
the four alleged ' ringleaders ' were identified first , and it is clear that their positions within the @entity122 and background in legal work helped them evade capture for years			2
moving up north : unlike many of the fraudsters who retired to @entity11 , @entity248 moved to @entity252 , but that does n't put him out of the scope of the @entity119 active : @entity248 collected a total of $ 207639 since may 2008 participants would start out by contacting @entity258 , 61 , a @entity165 consultant , or @entity166 , 64 , a retired member of the @entity122			1
@entity163 or @entity260 would then refer the fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme - @entity264 , 89 , and former @entity266 agent @entity174 , 83			2
all four are charged with first and second degree grand larceny			0
the 9/11 disability claims are not the first that the four men have had a hand in , as @entity59 reports that they are believed to have been running disability scams since 1988			1
' my client 's involvement in this scheme was minimal at best ... he maintains his innocence , ' @entity163 's lawyer @entity274 told the @entity280			0
the lawyers put the schemers in touch with two different doctors - but not after some coaching			0
the district attorney laid out a series of different trigger phrases that would help justify an anxiety condition prescription			0
they range from ' i nap on and off during the day ' to ' my ( family member ) is always after me about my grooming '			0
not hurting too badly : @entity294 , 58 , lives in @entity295 , @entity148 and his alleged disabilities - which have not been specifically disclosed - should have prevented him from motorcycling but he proudly posted this to @entity88 throwback : @entity294 had no qualms about posting this old picture of him in uniform online , and he was far from the only ' boy in blue ' that was involved in the scheme other possible additions included the lamentation that they were ' healthy , active , productive ' people but no longer			2
' they 're liable to say ... spell the word " world , " so you go " @entity312 - @entity311 " then they 're gon na say " spell it backwards			0
" you think about it , and you ca n't spell it backwards , " ' court papers report that @entity260 said in a recording			0
all told , the fraudulent claims cost $ 24.5million in taxpayer - funded benefits			2
' for years , federal taxpayers have unwittingly financed the lifestyles of the defendants charged today , ' district attorney @entity320 said in a statement which listed all of the 106 accused			2
busted : @entity326 collected $ 232,443 from the fund but also broke the rules by working as a helicopter pilot - a job which would be extremely difficult should he actually have the condition he claimed to suffer from ' many participants cynically manufactured claims of mental illness as a result of september 11th , dishonoring the first responders who did serve their @entity337 at the expense of their own health and safety			1
this alleged scam further depleted the already limited resources available for battling the real and complex conditions of ptsd and depression			0
' the case is the biggest bust that was announced since the new mayor , @entity347 , and his team has been in office , making this the first time in his recent tenure that new police commissioner @entity351 has weighed in on the work of the @entity354 's office			0
' the retired members of the @entity122 indicted in this case have disgraced all first responders who perished during the search and rescue efforts on september 11 , 2001 , and those who subsequently died from 9/11 related illness , by exploiting their involvements that tragic day for personal gain , ' @entity351 said in the statement .			1

@entity9 , 60 , is one of dozens of retired @entity122 officers who claimed to have a debilitating disorder that stopped him from working
he was called ' one of the most flagrant ' scammers in the $ 400million pension - fraud scheme
some of the *102* scammers stole from the 9/11 disability fund , while others like @entity9 had been *pilfering* from the fund for more than two decades
according to prosecutors , @entity9 collected $ 470,395.20 over 26 years , the most money over the longest period of time
he was arraigned in court on monday and singled out among the other 16 defendants as the only person that needed to post $ 20,000 in bail
the whole scheme cost taxpayers $ *21.4million* dollars
