' his comment was followed by a large applause from the audience			0
@entity0 was heckled after claiming that like @entity8 , he , too , was an ' unrelenting libertarian ' all applause from the conservative audience stopped as @entity0 gave reasoning into why he considers himself a libertarian			1
' i am an unrelenting libertarian who 's also responsible for four decades of his life for another important part of [ the @entity39 ] , the part that says " provide for the common defense , " ' he said			1
the majority of the conservative audience members appeared to support @entity7 analyst @entity8 's viewpoints ( file photo ) @entity0 's comments came after @entity8 told the audience they should be ' outraged ' by @entity1 's surveillance programs , first revealed in 2012 by whistleblowers including @entity52			1
@entity8 warned the crowd that the government had the power to turn on people 's phones , read texts and listen to conversations			1
' we are in a twilight era where freedom is diminishing , ' the judge told the audience			2
@entity0 said in his followup : ' if @entity1 were even capable of doing what the judge has outlined for you we would n't have be having a debate here today			2
there would be nothing to argue about			0
' later into the debate , @entity8 asked the former @entity1 chief : ' does the head of @entity1 have the constitutional legal authority to move the line between privacy and surveillance ?

' the accusations fit on a bumper sticker but reality takes a little bit longer , ' @entity0 said , going on to say that while targeting foreigners , the @entity1 is required to withhold information collected about @entity89 citizens , according to the @entity90			0
' so in other words , foreign terrorist , " @entity91 " was talking to a known @entity89 person			0
we minimize the @entity89 identity to protect your privacy , unless of course , the identity of the @entity89 is absolutely essential to the intelligence value of the intercept in the first place , ' he said			0

@entity0 failed to respond to @entity8 's main argument , that seizing an @entity89 's property without probable cause violates the @entity39 's @entity28			1
the former @entity1 chief has said in the past that privacy is a line that people must ' continuously negotiate ' at one point , @entity0 said the debate was ' beginning to feel like an away game '			2
