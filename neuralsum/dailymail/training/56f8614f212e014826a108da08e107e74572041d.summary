by @entity0 published : 19:23 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 19:24 est , 19 april 2013 work that is physically demanding may boost your chances of suffering heart disease compared with desk jobs , claim researchers			1
doing a hard day 's work increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 20 per cent more than office workers , with the risk increasing with the amount of exertion involved			1
the surprising find by @entity17 researchers runs contrary to official guidelines in most western countries which recommend physical activity to stave off heart attacks			2
at risk : people who do physically demanding jobs such as bricklaying are more likely to have heart problems a second study from @entity28 and @entity29 showed that exercise in a gym improved the coronary health of office workers but had a detrimental effect on those who already carried out manual labour as part of their job			1
dr @entity40 , who led the @entity17 study , said people in physically demanding jobs could be under extra stress , were lower paid and might have less access to healthcare			1
he said it was unclear why hard work increased heart disease risk , when greater physical activity was normally linked to a lower risk			0
but the higher risk experienced by manual workers should make them targets for prevention by healthcare staff , he added			2
making things worse : people who have physically demanding jobs increase their chance of heart disease if they work out at the gym as well dr @entity62 , who led the @entity28 and @entity29 study , said ' the results of this study suggest that additional physical activity during leisure time in those who are already physically exhausted from their daily occupation does not induce a ' training ' effect but rather an overloading effect on the cardiovascular system			1
' the studies were presented yesterday at a meeting of the @entity78 in @entity79			0
in the @entity81 people are advised to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening , dancing or brisk walking , or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise including playing sport , running or aerobics every week			0
three out of four @entity81 fail to achieve this			0
the study by @entity90 , associate professor of biostatistics - epidemiology at @entity92 , @entity93 , looked at 250 patients who suffered a first stroke and 250 who had a first heart attack , and they were compared with a control group of 500 healthy people			0
stroke and heart patients were more likely to have a physically demanding jobs than those in the control group - with the more demanding jobs carrying the greatest risk , said the researchers			1
having a sedentary job led to a 20 per cent lower risk of a heart attack or stroke			0
in a second study investigators in @entity28 and @entity29 looked at more than 14,000 middle - aged men who did not have heart disease and followed them for three years on average			0
they found physically demanding work was a risk factor for developing coronary heart disease			2
they also found that men in physical jobs who also did moderate to high levels of exercise in their spare time had a fourfold higher risk of heart disease			0
dr @entity128 said ' from a public health perspective it is very important to know whether people with physically demanding jobs should be advised to engage in leisure time activity			1

people in physically demanding jobs more at risk than office workers
and exercise in the gym can make situation even worse
@entity17 research suggests more activity has ' overloading ' effect on body
