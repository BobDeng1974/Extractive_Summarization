swingers on the hunt for excitement are spreading sexually transmitted infections by taking part in drug - fuelled orgies , new research claims			1
a @entity8 study found almost half of older swingers admitted taking illegal substances to boost their prowess in the bedroom and keep multiple partners satisfied			1
as well as erectile dysfunction drugs such as @entity23 , they are also using cocaine , ecstasy ( @entity26 ) , @entity27 , laughing gas , cannabis , poppers , speed , lsd and lysergic acid to help them perform - at levels similar to gay men			1
the researchers , writing in the journal @entity45 , say swingers should be targeted with the same health advice as other at - risk groups			1
these people are known to engage in high risk sexual behaviour such as having multiple sexual partners , group sex , and unprotected sex , but there is little data on their use of drugs and what impact that has			2
over- 45s have previously been found to wrongly believe they had a low risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection ( @entity45 )			0
but there is little data on swingers who have recently been classified as an emerging high risk group for @entity70			0
the researchers therefore set out to assess the prevalence of drug use among swingers and its link with high - risk sexual behaviour and @entity70			1
in the first study of its kind , they studied 289 men and women with an average age 49			1
these people said they were swingers and had visited a @entity45 clinic from 2009 to 2012 in @entity85 , @entity8			1
for the study , they filled out a questionnaire on their sexual and drug use behaviour while swinging , over the preceding six months			0
the researchers then looked for a link between sexual behaviour , drug use and @entity45 diagnoses including chlamydia , gonorrhoea , syphilis , @entity42 and hepatitis @entity97 more than three quarters of swingers reported recreational drug use - including alcohol , @entity23 ( pictured ) and illegal drugs they found 13 per cent of patients - with an average age of 45 - had chlamydia or gonorrhoea - similar to the rates among gay men and young people			1
dr @entity111 , of @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity8 , said : ' high - risk sexual behaviours are common among swingers			1
' by definition , swingers are also involved in concurrent sex as they have overlapping partnerships over a fixed period of time			0
' more than three quarters of swingers reported recreational drug use - including alcohol and use of @entity23			0
drugs were also frequently used in combination - especially the combination of @entity27 and @entity26			0
in men , a combination of mdma and erectile dysfunction drugs was frequently seen in men			0
' since swingers are involved in lengthy sexual acts with multiple partners , male swingers use erectile dysfunction drugs to maintain while using other drugs , ' explained dr @entity111			0
she noted eight per cent of the women reported recreational use of @entity23 , for which the effects are unknown			0
the results also showed that a quarter of the male participants had been with male swing partners in the last six months			0
and more than half of those surveyed - both men and women - had group sex in the same period , with half of them not using condoms			2
@entity149 reported having six or more sex partners over the preceding six months - and had not used a condom during vaginal sex			2
there was no differences in sexually risky behaviour between men and women dr @entity111 added : ' swingers - at least those attending our clinic - are a generally older group			2
' the prevalence of drug use observed among swingers in this study is very high and comparable with what is observed in men who have sex with men			2
' half of swingers interviewed reported having six or more sexual partners over the preceding six months - and had not used a condom during sex			1

@entity8 study found half of older swingers admitted taking illegal substances
half had six or more partners in past six months but not used condoms
13 per cent of patients - with an average age of 45 - had chlamydia or gonorrhoea - similar to the rates among gay men and young people
swingers ' should be given same health advice as other at - risk groups '
