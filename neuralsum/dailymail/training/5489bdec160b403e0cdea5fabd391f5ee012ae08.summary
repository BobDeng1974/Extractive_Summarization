sometime late on saturday night , @entity0 will walk out into the great boxing amphitheatre that is the @entity2 in @entity3 for his hotly - anticipated rematch with @entity5			1
the fighter is perfectly familiar with these surroundings - his last nine contests have been in that famous ring - but he will still feel that frisson of excitement and adrenaline that comes with placing your unbeaten record and titles on the line			1
but @entity0 will face the blinding flashbulbs , riotous noise and his @entity23 opponent safe in the knowledge that , whatever fate awaits him over the 12 rounds , his financial position and " money " monicker are secure			2
the fighter , unbeaten in 46 contests , has estimated career earnings of £ 250m @entity0 ( left ) will take on @entity5 at the @entity2 in a rematch this weekend			1
in the original fight in may , @entity0 won a brutal contest on a split decision @entity5 ( right ) connects with @entity0 during the original contest back in may @entity0 greets pop star @entity38 at a @entity40 basketball match			1
their friendship emphasises the showbiz sparkle that @entity0 brings to all of his fights for the fight itself is simply the culmination of a thorough and well - practised 12 - week process put into action by his company @entity50 every time he fancies stepping in the ring			1
as explored recently by the @entity54 , they have a successful formula that is pretty much unique in boxing and sport , one that reduces the risk to @entity0 and his finances to the absolute minimum			0
little wonder , then , that " money " is the highest paid athlete in the world , according to @entity65 , and is currently half - way through a remarkable pay tv deal that will pocket him a jaw - dropping $ 250m ( £ 154m )			1
his career earnings are estimated at about £ 250m , with a further £ 30m to come by the end of the weekend			1
saturday 's bout with @entity5 , in which @entity0 will defend his @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity75 welterweight and his @entity73 @entity77 titles , could be one of his last			1
@entity0 is the main focus for the camera bulbs as he promoted his fight with @entity5 in @entity3 @entity0 is right on target with a punch against @entity84 in their september 2013 fight @entity0 shows off his physique at the weigh - in for his 2011 contest with @entity90 @entity0 trades punches with opponent @entity92 in their fight in @entity3 last year @entity0 poses with his @entity95 title belt after defeating @entity92 in 2013 the 37 - year - old hinted this week that he will hang up his gloves next year after a maximum of three more fights			1
@entity5 comes first , following by two more against ' exciting ' opponents			0
the split - decision victory over @entity5 back in may took his record to 46 - 0			1
if all goes to plan , he 'll retire on 49 - 0 and wo n't be short of a pension			1
his victories in the ring rely on brute strength but @entity0 has also shown brains in engineering a marketing strategy that ensures he controls every aspect of fight night			2
first , he decides on the opponent alongside his trusted advisers , @entity113 , the chief executive of @entity50 , and @entity115 , long - standing business associate of @entity0			2
the amount paid to the opponents depends but the general range is between $ 1.5m ( £ 900,000 ) and $ 4m ( £ 2.4m )			0
it appears a pittance compared to the vast sums @entity0 rakes in , but then he is the champ			0
the profile of the opponent dictates the number of pay - per - view ( ppv ) sales , which cost $ 65 ( $ 40 ) a time for standard definition and $ 75 ( £ 46 ) for high definition on the @entity131 network			1
a pair of cheques worth $ 72,276,000 ( £ 44.45m ) paid by @entity135 's @entity134 to @entity136 , as posted on @entity0 's @entity138 account @entity0 with his pair of @entity141 sports cars in an image posted on his @entity138 account @entity0 arrives at his @entity3 boxing club driving a @entity146 @entity145 @entity0 's white fleet of sports cars outside his boxing club in @entity3 the number of sales hovers between one million for a lesser fight and two million for blockbusters like this saturday 's			1
@entity0 was smart and realised the potential of @entity125 early on , leading to the $ 250m + tie - in with @entity131 to screen his final six fights			1
when in negotiations , @entity0 held all the aces - he was already a box office name and his only obligation to the network was to turn up for the fight			1
it falls to @entity131 to brand and market the fight in the most effective way			2
they shoulder the burden and the risk ; @entity0 's money is already in the bank			2
overseas ppv deals , such as the one with @entity171 in the @entity172 , coin in another $ 2m ( £ 1.2m ) , while news channels seeking highlights and sports networks wanting delayed coverage all pay a premium			0
it will cost @entity0 's company , in collaboration with @entity134 , started by @entity135 , up to $ 3m ( £ 1.8m ) to assemble an undercard , but that is paid for by selling sponsorship opportunities at ringside			2
@entity0 leaves his private jet in @entity187 - the boxer owns two jets , one for him and one for his team the boxer 's white @entity191 , branded with ' @entity194 ' logo on the windows @entity0 in one of his favourite poses - with a pile of dollar bundles @entity0 makes himself at home in the @entity201 of the 6 * @entity202 in @entity203 then comes arranging the venue			1
the @entity2 has its reputation as the world 's leading boxing venue to uphold - they love the prestige , glamour and the packed house			0
so much so that they buy up 3,500 of the best seats and give the revenue - about $ 3.5m ( £ 2.15m ) - to @entity0			2
after all , he could easily take his circus down the road			0
@entity0 's people then oversee the coast - to - coast publicity tours and press conferences , the ubiquitous promotion and marketing , and the popular @entity224 spin - off			0
he is also adept at harnessing the power of social media			0
@entity0 is an avid tweeter and posts regularly on @entity227			0
these platforms not only give fans a tantalising glimpse into his habits and training regime but also help to perpetuate the ' money ' legend , cementing his ' top - of - the - bill ' status			0
@entity0 is not shy in flaunting his vast wealth			0
one @entity227 video clip saw @entity239 and @entity240 , two members of ' @entity194 ' ( @entity194 ) , playing a game to see which could count out $ 100,000 the fastest while @entity0 time them with a luxury watch			0
a white @entity141 , worth £ 750,000 , is his latest favourite runaround and sits proudly on his driveway next to an identical model in red and blue			2
@entity0 dresses himself in a @entity251 towel in an @entity227 picture posted in june this year a solid gold @entity253 , specially commissioned and presented to @entity0 as a present @entity0 poses with two of the cars in his ' black ' fleet - a @entity258 ( left ) and @entity259 a glimpse inside @entity0 's @entity263 private jet - the boxer owns two planes one of @entity0 's many jewel - encrusted watches in a collection worth hundreds of millions of dollars @entity0 said the contents of this watch case totalled $ 6.4m ( £ 3.9m ) the fighter 's fleet of cars is colour - coded depending upon which city he happens to be in - white for @entity3 , black for @entity273			1
his collection of expensive timepieces is something akin to an obsession			0
@entity0 splashed out $ 1m on one cut from 60 carat @entity280 diamonds by @entity282 - based @entity281 for good measure , he patented the design to ensure he earns a tidy commission on any replicas			0
during a publicity tour last year , @entity0 flew around on his own private plane , a @entity289 , which costs about $ 10m ( £ 6.15m ) second hand , while his 20 - strong entourage travelled on another jet			2
when out of the ring , the vast majority of @entity0 's life is played out on a whim			0
he usually carries about £ 40,000 cash in his pocket , or troubles one of his assistants to lug around a sports bag containing as much as £ 750,000			0
his vast fortune means he can do whatever he wants , whenever he wants and , with another superfight on the agenda this week , he 's showing no signs of slowing down .			0
