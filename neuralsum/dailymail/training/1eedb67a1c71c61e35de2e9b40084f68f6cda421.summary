by @entity0 published : 13:27 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 14:44 est , 12 july 2013 scarred : a month after the attack , mr @entity2 's scar is healing and he is able to eat solid foods again a diver says he is lucky to be alive after being attacked by a six - foot conger eel 25 metres below the surface			1
@entity2 from @entity8 was attacked by the giant eel while diving off the coast of @entity11			1
the 48 - year old , who is the owner of the famous @entity13 in @entity8 , suffered a severe bite to the face when undertaking his first dive in two years last month			1
he had to undergo surgery for two and a half hours and is grateful to plastic surgeon @entity19 for helping him			1
a vastly experienced diver with over 200 dives completed in his 20 - year diving career , mr @entity2 was left stunned when he was blind - sided by the eel 25 metres below the surface			1
' i did n’t see it until it had attacked me			2
it was an awful shock and i had to wrestle it off my face , ' he said			1
“ it managed to knock my regulator out of my mouth during the attack , so the first think i had to do was get that back and keep it calm			2
thankfully i managed to keep myself under control			0
' first instincts when under attack at that depth must be to immediately return to the surface , but mr @entity2 was thankful that his vast training kicked in instead			1
' i knew i had to remain calm , that was the most important thing			0
i returned to the surface gradually to avoid the bends and i managed to get back into the boat			0
' i knew by a few of the people that were on the dive with me that it was a pretty bad bite			0
' to complicate things i had driven my young daughter and my @entity57 mother - in - law out to the beach for the day so i had to make plans to take care of them , but once i knew i was going to @entity8 hospital i knew things would be okay , ' he said			2
his wife @entity63 and his teenage son were holidaying in @entity57 but rushed home when the incident happened			0
the award - winning baker had to survive on baby food for several days because his mouth was so sore			2
' my mouth was torn apart inside and it has been extremely tight			2
it has been a slow recovery			0
unusual : the unprecedented attack is not in keeping with @entity75 eels ' behaviour			1
mr @entity2 has both internal and external stitches ( left ) on his cheek to tighten the skin around his mouth ' i have a huge amount of internal stitches as well as external stitches , ' he added			1
after being subject to such a strange occurrence , mr @entity2 began to look into the history of attacks by @entity75 eels and he says he is yet to find a precedence			1
' they are usually afraid of humans and shy away from life			1
they usually stay in their holes and come out during the night			0
we think this one must have been blind or something to attack me like that			2
' i ’ve had a good look online and i can not find any other incident of someone being attacked by a @entity75 eel			1
and the fact that it happened in open water means it really was a freak incident			0
' but it wo n’t put me off			0
i wo n’t hesitate in going diving again			0
it ’s funny , it was two years since my last dive and for that to happen is strange			0
but i ’ll give it a go again at some stage i ’m sure , ' he said .			0
