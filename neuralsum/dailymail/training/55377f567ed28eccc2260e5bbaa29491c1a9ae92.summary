@entity0 said support for flawed wind and solar power cost billions and made electricity and gas needlessly expensive the former environment secretary attacked a so - called ‘ green blob ’ at the heart of @entity15 yesterday – accusing @entity9 officials and ministers of raising energy prices for the poor			1
@entity0 said their support for flawed wind and solar power cost billions and made electricity and gas needlessly expensive			1
he said the ‘ green blob ’ included civil servants and quangos in thrall to the climate change and environmental lobby			2
he claimed it had blocked him from prioritising shale gas exploration as a more efficient way to secure energy for the future			2
mr @entity0 , who was removed as environment secretary in july , said the only way to ‘ keep the lights on ’ was to scrap the @entity34 , which requires the @entity35 to use more renewable energy and is backed by civil servants			1
he warned claims of impending environmental disaster were ‘ widely exaggerated ’ , and accused a series of energy secretaries – including the @entity42 incumbent @entity41 – of being ‘ sheriffs of @entity45 ’ by taking from the poor			1
he said : ‘ it amazes me that our last three energy secretaries , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity41 , have merrily presided over the single most regressive policy we have seen in this country since the sheriff of nottingham : the coerced increase of electricity bills for people on low incomes to pay huge subsidies to wealthy landowners and rich investors			2
’ the former minister also said he was disgusted by rich film stars who fly to @entity63 to preach against the burning of fossil fuels there			0
his reference to the ‘ green blob ’ follows former education secretary @entity70 ’s description of the teaching establishment as the ‘ blob ’			2
speaking to the @entity73 think tank , mr @entity0 claimed the effects of climate change had been ‘ consistently and widely exaggerated ’ , and policies to encourage onshore wind farms will cost £ 1.3trillion by 2050			1
he said wind turbines had ‘ devastated landscapes , blighted views , divided communities , killed eagles , carpeted the countryside and the very wilderness that the “ green blob ” claims to love with new access tracks cut deep into peat , boosted production of carbon - intensive cement , and driven up fuel poverty – while richly rewarding landowners ’			1
mr @entity0 claimed the effects of climate change had been ‘ consistently and widely exaggerated ’ , and policies to encourage onshore wind farms ( pictured ) will cost £ 1.3trillion by 2050 current energy policy , he said , was a ‘ slave to flawed climate action ’ , adding : ‘ it neither reduces emissions sufficiently nor provides the energy we need as a country			1
’ offshore wind farms were ‘ proving a failure ’ , hydro - electric power was ‘ maxed out ’ and solar power was an ‘ expensive red herring ’			1
he condemned solar farms as a ‘ futile eyesore , and a waste of land that could be used for other activities ’			2
he urged greater investment in shale gas – pointing out that 40 per cent of @entity35 ’s coal was from @entity113 and adding : ‘ it is better to burn @entity116 shale gas than @entity118 ’s coal			0
‘ we must be prepared to stand up to the bullies in the environmental movement and their subsidy - hungry allies			0
’ @entity124 was yesterday denounced as ‘ evil ’ by dr @entity125 , who helped to found it 40 years ago			0
the ecologist , 67 , accused it of risking lives by opposing the development of genetically - modified ‘ golden rice ’ with added vitamin a , which could save malnourished children			0
he told @entity134 ’s today programme : ‘ they lost concern for humans			0
they have turned into basically an evil organisation			0
’ but dr @entity140 , of @entity124 , said there were better alternatives to golden rice			0
the group was condemned this year when it emerged that one executive was flying several times a month from @entity145 to @entity146 .			0
