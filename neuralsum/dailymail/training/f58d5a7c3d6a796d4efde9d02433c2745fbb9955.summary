by @entity0 and mail online reporter the @entity4 state trooper who arrested @entity6 defensive lineman @entity5 at a traffic stop last june has been fired , state officials said friday			1
the @entity8 said in a news release that @entity11 @entity10 was terminated for violating agency policies including conduct unbecoming a state employee			1
@entity10 stopped @entity5 in june when the @entity16 defensive lineman was returning to his home in @entity18			1
but the trooper 's dashboard camera obtained soon after by @entity30 also captured the officer threatening to use a taser because the 6 - foot - 3 , 262 - pound lineman was struggling to understand his commands			2
' the next thing you 're going to get is the @entity23 , ' @entity10 was heard to say on the tape			2
' whoa , ' @entity5 responded , ' i 'm not trying to cause problems			0
' @entity5 said he was returning home to @entity18 when pulled over			2
he played football for @entity42 , then spent three seasons at @entity44 where he had 19 career sacks and helped the @entity46 to the 2011 national championship game won by @entity48			0
@entity5 was selected by @entity49 in the third round of the 2013 draft			0
however , he was inactive for the @entity49 ' first seven games and waived by the club last october			0
@entity54 signed him to the practice squad in december			0
@entity5 signed with @entity16 as a free agent in april			1
at the time of the incident , agency spokeswoman @entity57 said in a statement the department expects troopers treat the public with courtesy and respect			1
when @entity5 's arrest was brought to the agency 's attention , ' we began a review of the traffic stop and self - initiated an internal investigation , ' @entity57 says			2
@entity10 was suspended soon after the stop while the agency investigated			2
the department 's @entity75 found @entity10 's behavior was unprofessional and comments to @entity79 during the arrest were inappropriate , according to a release sent by agency communications director @entity57			1
@entity5 's ticket was dismissed by a judge in july when @entity10 did not show up for traffic court in @entity85			1
the agency said @entity10 's interactions with @entity5 were ' inconsistent with how he was trained to conduct a traffic stop			1
' its release said @entity10 's command , ' @entity6 , you are under arrest , ' to @entity5 could be seen as suggesting that he was being arrested because of his status as a pro football player			1
@entity10 also deviated from protocol when he immediately arrested @entity5 without telling him why he was stopped , the agency said			1
the agency said @entity10 's interactions with @entity5 were ' inconsistent with how he was trained to conduct a traffic stop ' the department 's statement said @entity10 's comments to @entity79 on the ride to the detention center were inappropriate at times , including when he said , ' we can pull that ( seat belt ) across you tight and lock it , and we make it a very uncomfortable ride to jail			1
' the department said that @entity10 's assertion to @entity79 that at 25 mph over the speed limit , ' you get arrested , ' was a misrepresentation of facts because its investigation showed @entity10 arrested some violators and not others in similar circumstances			1
the agency said @entity10 was disciplined previously for unprofessional conduct and making inappropriate comments			2
' these violations demonstrate behavior that is inconsistent ' with agency standards , the department said			0
the @entity30 attempted to reach @entity10 for comment			0
two phone numbers listed for him have been disconnected			0

' trying to get home			0
i 'll take the lick			0
' @entity5 was a standout defender at @entity42 and @entity44 before getting drafted by the @entity49 in the third round of the 2013 draft			0
