@entity1 officers flew spying missions over the @entity3 at the height of the @entity5 , it was revealed yesterday			0
after decades of secrecy , the @entity7 declassified documents that show @entity11 pilots were involved in the @entity13 flights in 1959 and 1960			1
they gathered vital intelligence which the head of the @entity18 agency said he regarded as worth ‘ a million dollars ’			2
classified : a u- 2 plane successor to those flown in the @entity5 until now the @entity21 has neither confirmed nor denied the participation of the @entity1 in the controversial missions , a position it will no longer be able to maintain			1
the first u- 2 flights over the @entity3 started in july 1956 , but despite the valuable information gathered , president @entity25 was concerned about the ramifications of such a flagrant breach of @entity32 air space if they were discovered			1
unfortunately for the @entity18 , even though the hi - tech u- 2s flew at more than 70,000ft , the @entity32 were able to track the planes			0
shot down : pilot @entity36 was captured in 1960 in the @entity3 the @entity3 sent a strongly - worded protest to @entity25 , who developed cold feet about the missions and suspended such flights in december 1956			1
however , the @entity7 was very keen for the spying missions to continue and looked for ways , in the words of the newly released document , ‘ to increase the possibility of plausible denial ’			1
the solution was to use @entity11 pilots for the sensitive missions			1
during the spring of 1957 , negotiations took place between the @entity7 and the chief of @entity53 , sir @entity52 , who saw the obvious intelligence benefits for @entity11			1
by the summer of 1958 , prime minister @entity55 had given his authorisation , and four @entity1 officers , squadron leader @entity60 and @entity62 @entity61 , @entity63 and @entity64 – all of whom were in their twenties and single – were sent to train in @entity67			0
but flying the @entity68 was not without risk , and on july 8 , 1958 , @entity60 was killed when his plane crashed			0
the cause was never definitively established , but it is thought the aircraft disintegrated at high altitude			0
he was immediately replaced by wing commander @entity75			0
by january 1959 all four men had finished their training and were sent to a secret air base in @entity79 , from where they would launch their flights over the @entity3 and the @entity82			2
in order to emphasise @entity18 denials of the operation , the @entity13 planes were formally transferred on paper to the @entity11 government			2
@entity25 wrote a top - secret letter to @entity90 stating : ‘ @entity11 missions are carried out on your authority and are your responsibility			1
’ and the flights remained a secret in @entity11 , too			2
the pilots were no longer paid by the @entity1 , but by @entity53 , and the public was told the men were engaging in ‘ high - altitude weather - sampling missions ’			1
the first mission was flown by @entity102 on december 6 , 1959 , over the @entity104 missile test range and a squadron of long - range bombers in the @entity107			0
sensitive missions : until now the @entity21 has neither confirmed nor denied the participation of the @entity1 it was a huge success and proved the @entity3 did not have as many bombers as they claimed – a vital piece of intelligence at the height of the @entity5			1
the head of the @entity7 called @entity75 ’s bomber picture ‘ a million - dollar photo ’			2
the second @entity119 2 mission over the @entity3 was flown by @entity63 the following month			0
although his brief was to look for missile sites around the @entity122 , he ended up uncovering a new type of @entity3 bomber called the @entity125 at @entity126			0
the @entity18 later resumed their involvement in the @entity13 missions , but this came to an abrupt end in the wake of the @entity3 shooting down and imprisoning @entity18 pilot @entity36 in may 1960			0
the @entity11 ordered the @entity1 officers to leave @entity79 immediately			0
the following year , all four @entity11 pilots received the @entity135 , although their citations in the @entity137 did not mention exactly why			1
only now , after more than 50 years , has the truth been revealed .			0

@entity11 pilots were involved in the u- 2 flights in 1959 and 1960
they were used in sensitive missions after an agreement between the @entity7 and the head of @entity53 , who saw intelligence benefits for @entity11
