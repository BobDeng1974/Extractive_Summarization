by @entity0 for @entity1 a gold - rush has hit a seaside town - after a @entity5 artist buried £ 10,000 worth of bullion as part of an arts festival			1
hundreds of amateur treasure hunters flocked to a beach at @entity11 , @entity12 earlier today in a bid to get their hands on a share of the solid gold deliberately buried in the sand			1
excited children with their parents , hobby archeologists and competitive teens packed the beach at low tide to try and find the hidden bullion			2
the search started at 4pm on thursday with 150 people arriving to begin digging			2
but by friday lunchtime there were around 250 hunters armed with buckets , spades and even metal detectors			1
more are expected over the weekend			0
friends @entity55 , 25 , and @entity56 , 26 , travelled from @entity57 in @entity58 to try and get their hands on some buried treasure			2
some of the treasure hunters came armed with metal detectors with reports that the local @entity64 had even sold out of the high - tech devices they stood in one of the deepest holes on the beach as the dug down looking for the precious metal			1
but as the tide closed in they said they have had no luck yet			0
@entity55 said : ' yesterday we did n't dig , we just stood up the top and watched - getting tactics to see where other people have and have n't dug			1
' it 's strange because although there 's quite a few people down here , everyone 's doing it randomly			0
there 's no sense of unity at the moment			0
' @entity56 - standing in his boxers as parts of the two - foot trench begin to close in around him - said : ' i quite like the them and us attitude going on at the moment			0
' but some people have other ideas and have joined up with neighbouring diggers to form a united front			0
@entity11 mum @entity101 , 42 , and her son @entity102 have teamed up with the @entity104 ' family and promised to share the wealth			0
dressed in a camouflage jacket , with an army hat and a patch on his eye , @entity102 , six , said : ' i 've made friends with these boys and now we 're all like pirates			0
so we help each other			0
' the beach , which becomes partly covered at high tide , is open to the public , leaving a free - for - all approach to the adventure			1
university student @entity120 , 21 , and his nephews , @entity122 and @entity123 , said they were finding the experience a lot of fun			1
@entity123 , five , said : ' we have n't found anything yet but we hope we will			1
if i do find gold i am going to buy one million thousand ice creams			0
' but @entity122 , three , said : ' if i found treasure i 'd hide it from @entity123			1
' one child thought he hit the jackpot when he uncovered this gold - coloured bar - unfortunately it 's fake others seem to believe that digging in the sand was its own reward and gold bars would be a bonus despite rumours of the event being a hoax , today no one doubted that thousands of pounds of gold lay hidden beneath their feet			1
father - of - two @entity148 , from @entity150 , said : ' i 've watched people keep themselves to themselves , taking the whole thing very professionally , and then disappear in the middle of their dig. ' people are obviously finding them - rumour has it maybe three or four - and are just quietly wandering home with a smile on their face			2
' the stunt is part of the @entity165 sculptor 's piece for this year 's @entity166 - an art festival which starts tomorrow			0
defying convention , this gentleman has decided to deploy his walking stick to probe the sand the bars of gold weigh 10 grams and 20 grams and are worth £ 250 and £ 500 each			1
it is believed one bar was found on thursday evening but the unknown treasure hunter has kept their find close to their chest			2
the gold fever meant that a branch of @entity64 in @entity11 completely ran out of metal detectors as savvy hunters used technology in a bid to find the loot			1
but it is understood metal washers have also been buried in the sand to make it harder for metal detectors to get an accurate reading - to give people with just spades a better chance of success			1
some of the treasure hunters have returned to the beach for the second time today to hunt for gold the piece , called @entity200 , has been commissioned by the @entity202 - based arts producers situations , an organisation that say they are trying to change the perception of what public art can be			1
director , @entity207 , said : ' i am so pleased with how well this has gone			0
' it has been the biggest secret to keep as we 've been working on it for a year			0
' in fact , when we were hiding the gold at four in the morning a dog walker came up to us and said ' what 're you up to then ? digging for treasure ? '			2
' i looked at her for a moment and then she laughed and said ' no , really , what are you doing ? ' we had to make up a story that we were testing the sand			0
' so often public art funding is spent on a sculpture or a bauble on a roundabout and part of what we do is to say , actually sometimes a temporary project can have as much impact in the collective memory as something that has been there a long time			0
' @entity237 helps you explore places and i think what the artist wanted was exactly what you see here today - people away from their @entity245 and computer screens , alive with imagination and excitement			2
' festival director @entity207 said she is very pleased with the success of the event so far event staff have been working on the gold plan for more than a year and managed to keep the treasure secret			2

treasure hunters *frantically* dug up the sand in the hunt for £ 10,000 of gold
the 30 gold bars weighing 10 - *20g* are worth between £ 250 and £ 500 each
*prospectors* only have a few hours a day to dig while the tide is out
some people have deployed metal detectors in a bid to speed up the hunt
others are *wearing* just the pants and using *plastic* shovels
@entity122 , 3 , said if he found the treasure , he 'd hide it from *brother* @entity123 , 5
