the life sentence handed down to the schoolboy who murdered a teacher was today condemned as too harsh by youth justice campaigners			2
@entity4 , 16 , will serve at least 20 years for killing @entity5 , 61 , who was stabbed seven times from behind as she taught a @entity8 class at @entity9 in @entity10 in april			1
mr @entity11 warned @entity4 , who was 15 at the time , that he might never be released from prison - and her widower , @entity14 , described the killing as a ‘ monumental act of cowardice and evil ’			1
she told the @entity34 4 today programme : ‘ we are out of line with the whole of western @entity38			0
‘ there are no other countries within @entity38 which give children - and this boy is seen as a child under the @entity44 and is in the youth justice system - who would give children a life sentence			1
’ her comments were criticised as ‘ stupid ’ on @entity50 today			1
mrs @entity21 accepted that the sentence had to serve as a punishment , but said there was ‘ no evidence ’ for the 20 - year minimum tariff			1
‘ punishment is also incredibly important , particularly for the victims and families , but the fact is , how many years do we need for punishment ? we have given him a sentence which is more than his own lifetime , ’ she said			1
‘ he was 15 when he did this crime and we would say that you do n't need that long to punish			2

murder case : @entity4 ( right , in court ) will serve at least 20 years for killing @entity5 ( left ) who was stabbed seven times from behind as she taught a @entity8 class at @entity9 in @entity10 in april ‘ what is crucial is that when he is released he is assessed as no longer being of danger to himself and others and thus we would all be safer			1
' but there is no evidence that that takes 20 years and we 've looked and we think that this is the longest sentence given to a child in at least 10 years			1
‘ i 'm not going to tell you exactly what the right sentence would have been , but 20 years and a life sentence is too long			1
’ she continued : ‘ there are very good prisons , there is a prison called @entity91 [ in @entity92 ] which is a therapeutic community , and prisoners go there for a few years and it has great results			0
‘ the question is - safer society , yes ; punishment , yes - but does it need to be more than his lifetime ? ’ @entity104 , chief executive of @entity106 - based charity support after @entity107 , said that members of her organisation would ‘ not be impressed ' with mrs @entity21 's comments			1
she told @entity111 : ‘ people need to be aware that for many families the trauma of being bereaved in this horrific and traumatic way will never leave them and their lives can never be the same again			0
victim 's family : ( from left ) mrs @entity5 's daughters @entity120 and @entity122 and widower @entity123 at @entity124 following the sentencing of 16 - year - old @entity4 for the teacher 's murder ‘ with specialist support they can rebuild a life - but not the life they had before the brutal killing of their loved one			1
‘ every birthday , anniversary and @entity138 for the rest of their lives their loved one will be missed and the pain goes on for many , many years			0
‘ according to reports i believe this young man has said he “ could n't give a s * * * ” about the impact on her family			0
please will organisations or people who want to comment on cases like this think of the bereaved family involved			0
’ mrs @entity104 added that if and when @entity4 is released , he will probably have to be given a new identity - something which currently costs ‘ in the region of £ 250,000 per person ’			2
and @entity160 , assistant chief executive of the charity @entity161 said : ‘ sentencing is a matter for the court judge who has heard all the facts of the case , and is carried out in accordance with @entity170 guidelines			0
‘ we believe it is essential when passing sentence that judges and magistrates also consider the impact on the victim or the victim ’s family , not just the nature of the offence			0
‘ victims , the bereaved and the public need to understand the reasons why a particular sentence has been handed down , and therefore good communication is key			0
‘ to maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system it is vital that offenders are appropriately punished , that serious and violent crimes are dealt with robustly and that offenders are properly rehabilitated so they do n’t go on to commit more crime			0
’ @entity195 , editor of the @entity196 , said on @entity50 : ' someone bleating on @entity197 that @entity5 's killer 20 year “ minimum ” sentence too long			1
how about having someone say it 's too short ? ' author @entity202 added : ' who was that woman making stupid , stupid comments about 20 - year sentence being too long for school room killer ? tell her about psychopaths			1
' and company director @entity209 said : ' i 'm sure she would be saying the sentence was too long if it was her mother that had been murdered			2
' but @entity216 academic @entity215 told mrs @entity21 on @entity50 : ' good to hear you make those important points about capacity for change on @entity197 today this morning			1
' @entity221 - educated mrs @entity21 , 50 , who lives in a £ 1.7million four - bedroom semi-detached house in @entity223 , north - west @entity224 , has been working in prison and justice reform since 2007			2
prior to her work for the likes of the @entity229 , @entity29 and another charity called @entity231 , mrs @entity21 , who is married to @entity233 , 51 , was an account manager for a marketing firm and a radio producer			2
part of @entity4 's rehabilitation could see him return to a classroom during his sentence			1
@entity241 , chair of the @entity242 : @entity244 prison branch , said @entity4 could be taught in a class of around eight people with a focus on basic literacy and numeracy skills and vocational training to ensure prisoners are employable on their release			2
crime scene : @entity4 killed mrs @entity5 in this classroom at @entity9 in @entity10 in april @entity4 , who took and passed five gcses a year early , would be unlikely to be able to study for higher level qualifications			1
mr @entity241 , who teaches in prisons , said : ‘ i believe this young man is quite intelligent			0
he would probably be above the level they are trying to take them to in that establishment			0
’ he added : ‘ it used to be that there was funding for them to do higher level courses but because of the cuts it 's more difficult for people of a higher ability to continue their education			0
’ mr @entity241 said @entity4 would be treated the same as any other offender			2
he said : ‘ they will do a risk assessment on anybody but , unless they 're an immediate risk and deemed too dangerous to be in the class , he would be treated in exactly the same way as everybody else			0
’ @entity4 attacked mrs @entity5 after boasting to friends that he was going to kill her			1
he also said he was going to murder other teachers , including a pregnant woman ‘ so as to kill her unborn child ’			0
the court heard that he later told doctors : ‘ i said i was going to do other stuff but i never got the chance , other murders			0
it was a triple homicide			0
’ after the murder the teenager told psychiatrists that he ‘ could n't give a s * * * ’ and added : ‘ everything i 've done is fine and dandy			2
