a mother has defended her choice to undergo a controversial fertility treatment that helped her get pregnant with her now - teenage daughter			1
@entity4 became pregnant via a process called cytoplasmic transfer , which involves injected a donor egg into the mother 's egg to boost the egg 's health			1
however , the treatment has now been banned in the @entity13 and is currently under investigation for possible health risks to the child			1
' i think it was the only thing that helped me			0
if there were risks , it did n't matter			0
i wanted a child too much at that point , mrs @entity4 told @entity24			2
' it was definitely the right thing to do			0
' mrs @entity4 's daughter @entity26 is now a healthy teenager who is doing well in high school			1
' the right thing to do ' : @entity29 ( right ) was conceived through a controversial technique called cytoplasmic transfer			1
she sits at home with her mother @entity33 , who says she does not regret the decision but there are concerns that the treatment compromises the health of the child , many of which inherit @entity42 from three parents			1
@entity44 at @entity44 in @entity45 is now investigating what - if any - are the ill effects of the now - halted fertility technique before it was banned , the technique helped up to 30 women conceive , about 17 of which came from @entity44			1
why now ? around 17 babies were conceived at the @entity44 at @entity44 using cytoplasmic transfer , a now banned technique			1
now , well over a decade later , the clinic is reportedly looking into long - term effects on the children for the very first time only two of those children , both now in their teens , have been named			1
one of them @entity26 and the other is @entity63 , a @entity64 girl who became the first ever child born after being conceived by the 3 - parent technique when she arrived happy and healthy in 1997			1
today , @entity63 is a healthy teenage girl in high school			0
according to the @entity24 , neither has been checked for long - term health issues that could be related to the technique			2
hopeful : the new techniques help women with faulty mitochondria , the energy source in a cell , from passing on to their babies defects that can result in such diseases as muscular dystrophy , epilepsy , heart problems and mental retardation			2
about one in 200 children is born every year in @entity86 with a mitochondrial disorder			2
at the time @entity26 and @entity63 were conceived , scientists were using cytoplasmic transfer in the hopes it would increase the chances of successful conception in patients for whom traditional @entity94 had been unsuccessful			1
what it also did was transfer the donor 's mitochondrial dna -- which is passed along only by mothers -- into the fertilized egg			0
that left the egg carrying the dna of three parents : donor , recipient and father			0
in @entity63 , researchers said there was no lasting trace of the donor 's mitochondrial dna			0
according to the @entity24 , @entity26 has not been tested			2
however , some of the some 30 three - parent babies conceived worldwide did retain a third dna			2
before the technique could become more widespread , the @entity13 halted the use of the largely untested technique			1
a call made to the @entity44 by @entity117 was not immediately returned			0
reports of their investigation into children like @entity63 and @entity26 come just as @entity86 is considering legalizing more advanced and refined three - parent conception techniques			1
but instead of boosting fertility , scientists in @entity86 as well as the @entity13 now want to transfer mitochondrial dna as a means of preventing mitochondrial diseases from being passed on from mother to child			2
the new techniques help women with faulty mitochondria , the energy source in a cell , from passing on to their babies defects that can result in such diseases as muscular dystrophy , epilepsy , heart problems and mental retardation			0
about one in 200 children is born every year in @entity86 with a mitochondrial disorder			0
ill effects ? babies born with the help of a @entity45 fertility clinic using a technique that put the genes of three parents into an egg are now teenagers for a woman with faulty mitochondria , scientists take only the healthy genetic material from her egg or embryo			1
they then transfer that into a donor egg or embryo that still has its healthy mitochondria but has had the rest of its key dna removed			0
the fertilized embryo is then transferred into the womb of the mother			0
some groups oppose artificial reproduction techniques and believe the destruction of eggs or embryos to be immoral			0
@entity86 tabloids jumped on the procedure when it was first announced in 2008 and labeled it the creation of a three - parent baby — the mother , the donor and the father — a charge scientists claim is inaccurate because the amount of dna from the donor egg is insignificant .			0

@entity4 conceived her daughter @entity26 using a controversial @entity94 treatment called cytoplasmic transfer
seventeen babies were born using this treatment starting *15* years *ago*
the clinic at @entity44 is reportedly investigating the health of those children for the first time
the process was developed to encourage better fertility in @entity94 patients by splicing the eggs of two women
children born through this *method* may inherit @entity42 from three parents
the @entity13 *government* halted the technique in 2001 and only now is the health of the conceived babies - now teens - being followed up on by the @entity94 clinic
