it is too early to talk of dressing room mutiny but @entity4 coach @entity3 takes his team into wednesday night 's @entity7 group game against @entity8 with the murmurs of discontent gradually getting louder after two straight defeats			1
there is a strong suggestion that some players felt they were ill - prepared for the recent @entity15 , as evidenced by @entity19 defender @entity18 's post-match comments that he was surprised to find himself playing at left back when he had played all previous matches at centre back			0
critics have been scratching their heads at what appears to be a breakdown in communication – surely the players would having gone over and over their defensive positions in the week leading up to the game ? was @entity18 not training in that position in the last few sessions before the match ? @entity3 looks frustrated during @entity4 's most recent defeat against @entity34 in @entity35 on saturday @entity36 is n't happy about @entity4 's latest mishap as @entity3 looks to be losing the dressing room @entity4 's players look frustrated as they fell to a 1 - 0 loss in @entity35 after an unimpressive few results @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 pose in @entity48 's @entity47 photo as they landed in @entity49 @entity7 : @entity8 vs @entity4 @entity35 : @entity50 vs @entity4 @entity35 : @entity4 vs @entity51 @entity7 : @entity52 vs @entity4 @entity35 : @entity53 vs @entity4 @entity3 was asked about @entity18 's comments and he snapped : ' if a player who played regularly as a left back when he was at @entity53 is surprised at playing there , then we might as well all pack up and go home			1
' the @entity19 is not the only one that @entity3 's abrasive style may have rubbed up the wrong way			1
@entity62 was left in the stands for the team 's last match against @entity34 after television images showed him using his telephone on the bench in the second half of the @entity71 final			1
ever since the start of the season @entity62 has been left in little doubt that his place in the first team is anything but assured with @entity78 and @entity18 preferred by @entity3			1
and the @entity80 - winning defender is not the only one out of favour			0
@entity4 defender @entity62 was left in the stands for the team 's last match against @entity34 @entity4 train as @entity3 ( right ) looks on ahead of visiting @entity8 to play in the @entity7 a repeat of what happened in the @entity88 capital last year will turn @entity4 's season into full - blown crisis click here for more from @entity93 's @entity92 @entity94 was dropped for the @entity96 game , as was @entity97 , despite being one of the outstanding performers in the first few weeks of the season			1
@entity97 was replaced by @entity101 in the @entity15 – a player who the @entity4 coach had largely ignored before the fixture			1
players understand that no - one 's place is secured but such unpredictable swings from favouring one to to another creates a sense of instability			0
@entity3 was emotion - driven as a player , some @entity4 watchers are beginning to wonder if those characteristics need to be tamed now that he is in charge of such a big club			1
not everyone is exposed to the whims of the coach			0
@entity36 was consulted about whether he felt he should be taken off in a match against @entity120 earlier in the season and appeared to tell the bench that he wanted to stay on			0
when @entity3 was criticized after the game for giving in to his talisman he made a point of taking @entity36 off at the end of the next match			1
but it seems the @entity130 is the one man who does know where he stands with the @entity4 coach			2
unfortunately for @entity3 the areas of the team where he has been quick to drop important players is precisely the area where he now needs those players to play every week			2
@entity18 is ruled out for the next three matches with a calf injury and that leaves @entity3 with just @entity78 , @entity142 and @entity62 as his central defensive options			2
the @entity144 is increasingly being touted as an option for a midfield that is currently shorn of the injured @entity148 's talents			0
@entity4 have allowed @entity149 to go out on loan and sold @entity151 and @entity152 in the last two years while only bringing in @entity153			2
and sporting director @entity154 has also failed to remedy a squad imbalance in the centre of defence			0
@entity3 saw @entity36 , @entity48 and @entity158 fail to muster a goal against @entity34 at the weekend @entity4 legend @entity160 has attacked the current regime running the club after the @entity164 giants slipped off the top of @entity35			1
click here for the full story @entity168 has not played for four months after breaking down at the @entity80 and is not likely to feature any time soon and the decision to make him the key central defensive reinforcement looks increasingly flawed			0
the club is currently in the process of appealing @entity174 's decision to ban them from signing players for two transfer windows			0
the court of arbitration in sport will tell them in december if the sanctions will end after the next window or if the ban continues into next summer			0
whatever the result the immediate consequences of not being about to bring in reinforcements at the turn of the year remain very much in place			0
@entity4 have not been fourth in the table at this stage of the season since the 2003 - 04 season			1
@entity3 helps @entity48 up during the @entity35 loss ahead of their @entity7 clash with @entity8 it is true that they have only conceded four goals all season and they possess the world 's most feared front three			1
but @entity158 , @entity36 and @entity48 failed to muster a goal at the weekend against @entity34 and there is a flat and forlorn feel to the side at the moment that only midfield spark and defensive security will help shift			2
on tuesday they travelled to @entity49 knowing that a repeat of what happened in the @entity88 capital last year will only add to the sense of ensuing crisis			0
@entity3 's team have been set three stern tests so far this campaign and failed them all			2
@entity219 beat them in @entity19 earlier in their @entity7 campaign , @entity96 turned them over in the @entity15 , and @entity34 brought their unbeaten away record to the @entity222 and maintained it with a 1 - 0 win			1
last season @entity4 suffered their first defeat of the season at the @entity226 after 20 games without a loss			2
the 2 - 1 set - back cast doubts over then coach @entity231			0
the dark clouds of uncertainty are already rolling over @entity3 's head			0
@entity4 failed stern tests against @entity219 , @entity96 and @entity34 - and @entity3 is losing the dressing room			1

@entity4 lost 1 - 0 at the @entity222 against @entity34 on saturday night
@entity3 is losing the faith of the dressing room of the @entity242 giants
@entity4 travel to face @entity8 on wednesday night in @entity7
