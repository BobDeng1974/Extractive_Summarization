by @entity0 almost 20 years after being diagnosed with @entity1 's , @entity2 has defied all odds and stumped medical professionals by defying the disease and living a normal successful life			1
after being diagnosed with early onset dementia at the age of 46 in 1995 , the mother - of - three was devastated by her terminal prognosis			1
she was told she would need full - time care within five years and would be dead before she turned 60			1
and yet two decades later , ms @entity2 has reshaped medical thinking about the disease , writing two books , completing a post-graduate diploma and even entering into a new relationship with her partner - all while her brain continues to deteriorate			1
@entity2 was diagnosed with @entity1 's at only 46 years of age			1
she has since then astounded medical professionals and beat all the predictions regarding her health in 1995 , she visited a doctor for brain scans after experiencing a great deal of stress and extreme migraines			2
the then @entity30 government scientist was told by two separate doctors to leave her career behind as her scans showed that damage to her brain was well underway and would continue at a creeping rate , as is common with dementia			1
source : @entity1 's @entity30 they gave her the bleak diagnosis that she would be completely incapacitated and be required to move into a nursing home within five years - and then die three years later			1
' it was mind blogging			0
i was totally horrified , i could n't believe it could happen to anybody so young , ' ms @entity2 told the @entity46			1
' and then i just felt total horror as to what would face my girls and me in the future - my youngest was only nine and still in primary school			0
' what was terrifying was the way i would ; die without knowing anything - and that 's a really terrible fear to have			2
' somehow its difficult to be brave when you face losing the ability to be brave			0
but slowly im trying to adapt and its hard work trying to keep going , keep talking and keep thinking			0
' despite her emotional turmoil , ms @entity2 refused to simply let the disease take over her mind			1
she released a book , ' @entity66 ' , which explores the isolation and the feeling of identity loss experienced by dementia sufferers			2
three years after her diagnosis , she even fell in love and married @entity73 , who continues to support and encourage her to this day			2
it was on their first date that ms @entity2 said she told @entity73 of her diagnosis , but since then ' he has n't looked back , so we 're on this journey together , ' she said			1
' i call him my enabler , he enables me to keep functioning , rather than a carer which implies doing things for me			0
' three years after her diagnosis , she fell in love and married @entity73 ( right ) , who continues to support and encourage her to this day she has also released two books , including @entity66 , which explores the isolation and the feeling of identity loss experienced by dementia sufferers ms @entity2 has astonished medical professionals across the world , defying even the most positive odds , and has become an active advocate for people suffering from dementia by speaking about her personal experience within the wider social issue			1
' there was no support back then			2
when i rang up association they asked me " who are you looking after ? " and when i said it was me they said " we do n't have support for you , only for the carer " , ' ms @entity2 said			1
' i had a nine - year - old girl - how do you explain what you have and what 's going to happen ? ' she went to show and tell the next day and said " my mum has a hole in her head " because that 's what it looks like in the brain scan			2
' all of that has changed now ! i was so upset and passionate to change [ the lack of support ] at the time			0
' despite noting that positive changes since her own diagnosis , ms @entity2 believes there is still more to be done in order to help dementia sufferers lead a normal life in society			1
' i 'm really passionate about trying to make it better for other people being diagnosed today , ' she said			2
' i want people to feel brave and i want society to accept us as disabled people amongst us who deserve dignity and respect , not to be shunned and laughed at			0
' there are so many jokes out there about old timers disease and " i 'm losing my marbles "			0
people do n't realise that it 's like saying " i 've got a touch of cancer today "			2
it 's a terminal illness that people joke about			2
' ms @entity2 has become an active advocate for people suffering from dementia across the world by speaking about her personal experience with the wider social issue @entity2 was appointed @entity157 ambassador by @entity158 ( left )			1
she was also the first person with dementia to address the international conference of @entity1 's @entity161 the dementia advocate attributes survival to the immense support she receives from her family , as well as her consistent effort to stimulate her brain and use it in new ways			1
however , despite ms @entity2 's remarkable journey , the effects of the disease continue to creep in and make their impact			1
' i have no idea why i 've lasted this long except that i 've been trying very hard			0
but it does n't matter how hard some people try , it might not necessarily help them because their brain is disappearing too fast			0
' my brain is disappearing slowly and therefore giving me a chance to keep going			0
' as my brains disappears - and it 's definitely disappearing , bit and bits disappear everyday - i have to use different parts and i have to keep trying			0
i 'm rewiring my brain all the time			0
' i was functioning at high level to begin with – i am a very determined individual and i do get very exhausted			0
it would be very easy to just have a quieter life , but i think by putting all this effort in , it 's been worth it			0
not everyone is as lucky			0
' famous in @entity194 : ms @entity2 's second book , dancing with dementia , was written in response to requests for updates on her life and was commissioned by a @entity194 publisher she has done many interviews and documentarys in the last 20 years , and has given talks all over the world including in @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 ms @entity2 wants to continue inspiring hope within people who are suffering because of the disease , whether patient or carer			1

there is still much to be learned about the disease which presents itself in a range of symptoms that affect a person 's thinking , behaviour and the ability to perform everyday tasks			0
' i just want people to have hope for a future living a new life with dementia – and not to give up and fall into despair , ' she said			0
