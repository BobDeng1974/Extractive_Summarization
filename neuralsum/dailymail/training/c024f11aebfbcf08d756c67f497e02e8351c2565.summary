by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity1 an investigation has been launched amid fears nearly 160 cases of @entity7 poisoning across the @entity8 could be linked			1
@entity9 ( @entity10 ) said it was looking into a national outbreak of @entity12 after cases were reported in @entity14 , @entity15 , the @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
the cases occurred in ' isolated clusters ' over several months but officials now say they could be potentially linked			1
@entity9 has launched an investigation into a national salmonella outbreak after 156 cases were reported across @entity14 , the @entity16 , @entity15 , @entity18 and @entity17 ( file picture ) genetic tests suggest that the cause of illness in the 156 people could have come from a single source , @entity10 said			1
investigators are working alongside the @entity32 to look into the cause of the outbreak - which may have also affected people in @entity36 and @entity37			0
dr @entity38 , a consultant epidemiologist leading the @entity10 investigation , said : ' we are working with our colleagues across @entity10 , at the @entity32 , in local authorities and with other public health organisations in @entity44 to investigate the cause of this outbreak			0
' we are making good progress and hope to have more conclusive evidence shortly			0
' we will continue to monitor the situation and if there is any further public health action necessary then we will ensure that this takes place			0
' across @entity9 experts are examining 55 cases in @entity14 , 32 of which have been connected with an oriental restaurant , and 33 cases in @entity17 and @entity18 , 31 of which have been linked to one oriental takeaway			1
symptoms of @entity7 ( above ) include vomiting , diarrhea , fever , headaches , nausea and stomach cramps @entity10 are also looking at 43 cases in the @entity16 , 34 of which were connected with the @entity69 outbreak			1
anyone can get salmonella , but young children , the elderly and people whose immune systems are not working properly have a greater risk of becoming severely ill. symptoms include watery diarrhoea , stomach cramps and sometimes vomiting and fever			1
these symptoms usually last for four to seven days and clear up without treatment , but if you become seriously ill you may need to be treated for dehydration ( fluid loss ) caused by the illness			2
transmission occurs by eating contaminated food , mainly of animal origin , or by faecal contamination from an infected person or animal			0
the @entity93 , which runs the @entity95 hospital , confirmed the outbreak in june and said four members of staff and 19 patients had tested positive for the common strain of salmonella			2
all were suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting â€“ which are typical symptoms of the bug			2
@entity10 also said officials were looking at 25 cases of reported salmonella poisoning in @entity15			1
@entity12 is a strain of bacteria that causes gastrointestinal illness and is often linked to poultry or eggs			2
professor @entity113 , head of biological and biomedical science at @entity115 , said : ' if the cases are related , the next important stage will be identifying common risk factors which are associated with the infected individuals			0
' this might be consumption of a contaminated food or ingredient or even a common exposure at an event or activity			0
' compiling food and exposure histories of cases occurring over several months can be complex and time - consuming , depending on the quality of the information available , and it may be some time before we know the true extent of the outbreak and the causative link , if any			0

@entity9 said reported 156 reported cases in @entity8 may be linked
cases confirmed in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18
salmonella symptoms include vomiting , diarrhea , fever and stomach cramps
