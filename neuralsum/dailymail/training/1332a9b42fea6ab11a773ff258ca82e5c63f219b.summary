the story of the greatest escape of @entity2 has been told for the first time			0
the audacious breakout saw dozens of @entity6 prisoners of war scale the wire at a camp deep in @entity10 using four huge ladders they had made and disguised as bookshelves			1
during the breakout 32 prisoners got out and legendary pilot @entity16 , who was a prisoner in @entity9 near @entity17 , described it as the most daring escape of the war			1
one of the ladders laying across the fences the day after the escape on august 31 1942 , photographed by @entity25 camp guards it was overshadowed by the famous tunnel @entity27 which was immortalised in a @entity30 film starring @entity31 and @entity32			1
but a new book describes the incredible breakout two years earlier and pays tribute to the unsung heroes behind it			0
they were led by @entity39 , a charismatic 37 - year - old from @entity40 , @entity41 , who was one of the most determined escape artists in captivity			2
after repeated failures with tunnels - which camp guards kept finding - he decided to go over the wire			2
he initially planned to get 250 men out but in the end had to settle on 40			0
a young @entity52 lieutenant , @entity51 , 23 , then came up with the idea of making the folding ladders to scale the twin 12 - foot high perimeter fences , which stood six feet apart			2
@entity56 launched @entity57 , so - called because it was an international effort involving men from all over the @entity60 , which took five months to plan			1
the 2nd @entity61 ( pictured ) in september 1939 - @entity39 is third from the right on the front row the ladders were made of two 11ft long sections , each with seven rungs which would open and form a right - angled bridge up and across the fence			1
the wood was plundered from a hut the vengeful camp guards had wrecked after finding yet another attempted escape tunnel			1
the first ladder was made in the camp 's music room where the prisoners had relatively free rein and the sawing and hammering could be hidden by the sounds of instruments			2
the two sections were stood against the wall and disguised as new shelving units and filled with sheet music and other literature			0
they even fooled the despised camp 's chief security officer , @entity89 , who inspected them and praised them for being well made			0
in the meantime the prisoners had discovered how to short the perimeter floodlights thanks to an electrical fault deliberately left by forced labourers who built the camp			2
@entity99 's hand - drawn map of the section of camp where the plan unfolded - it shows the planned routes of the four escape teams as the ladders were built , a forging department dubbed ' @entity106 ' produced the documents the escapees would need			1
they were led by @entity113 flt lt @entity112 ' @entity111 , an ace forger who was the basis for @entity117 's character in @entity119 film			0
@entity111 took part in the real @entity27 from @entity121 in 1944 and was among the 50 executed in cold blood on @entity124 's orders			2
@entity125 for the escape was set for 9.30pm on august 30 1942 and 40 @entity6 prisoners gathered in two huts near the perimeter			1
each man carried 12lbs of food to last him between 18 - 21 days , plus washing kit , tinned cigarettes , basic medical kit , spare socks and underwear			2
maps were made on very fine tissue paper and compasses were smuggled into the camp in @entity142 parcels by @entity143 , the specialist ' escape ' arm of military intelligence in @entity148			0
the lights were knocked out and a short distance away two homemade grappling hooks left hidden by the wire were pulled by unseen hands to distract the nearest sentry , who was standing 50 yards away			0
two white painted ladders had been left leaning against the fence , adding to the bluff and a stream of fake orders were shouted in the air by two @entity25 - speaking @entity163 officers			1
another view of the ladders left behind by the prisoners and photographed by @entity25 camp authorities the day after the escape at the same time , in the music room other prisoners were gleefully playing instruments as loudly as possible to add to the general confusion			1
the diversions worked perfectly as the four 10 - man teams darted from the huts carrying their ladders ‘ like firemen ’ , and hit the fence			1
four men quickly erected the ladders and locked the ' bridge ' section in place and the teams poured over the wire			1
unluckily , ladder number four collapsed after just two men had managed to climb over , but the other three ladders worked like clockwork and in just 40 seconds a total of 32 men were free			1
belatedly , the guards realised what was happening and began shooting into the dark with their rifles and machine guns			0
incredibly , just one @entity6 prisoner was hit by the hail of bullets , when one ricocheted into his heel - but it failed to stop him			1
six of the escapees were quickly recaptured , but by dawn 26 pows were free			1
back in the camp , in cheeky reference to the @entity209 ' narrow escape from @entity210 a year earlier , a sign had appeared against the ladders : ' another @entity163 evacuation			0
' @entity51 's identity card from @entity215 , where he was sent following the @entity216 and @entity217 of the 26 escapees remaining , just three successfully had a ' home run ' and got back to @entity163 via @entity220			2
they were later awarded the @entity222 and have all since died			0
author @entity223 , a military historian , said : ' the escape itself was one of the first mass escapes and the to my mind the most daring of the war			2
' what struck me was the nature of it - the sheer audacity of it			0
' this was slightly suicidal - the idea of charging the wire and running into the night - and rather unique			0
' if the distractions had n't been so successful it would have ended in disaster and a great many of the prisoners would have been shot			0
as it was , 32 made it over the wire			0
' he added : ' this kind of escape could really only be done once			0
' later in the war the @entity25 were more inclined to shoot those who were recaptured , as they did with the @entity249			1
' ' @entity250 , @entity251 of @entity2 's @entity252 ' , by @entity223 is published by @entity253 .			0

daring escape code named @entity256 took five months to plan and allowed 32 @entity6 prisoners escape
prisoners built four huge ladders they disguised as bookshelves under the nose of @entity10 prison guards
the wood was plundered from a hut the @entity25 had broken after discovering yet another @entity6 escape tunnel
prisoners set up a *series* of distractions and four 10 - man teams ran from the huts carrying ladders and hit the fence
six escapees were quickly recaptured but by dawn 26 pows were free - although only three managed to get home
despite being overshadowed by the @entity27 , @entity256 has been described as the most daring escape of the war
