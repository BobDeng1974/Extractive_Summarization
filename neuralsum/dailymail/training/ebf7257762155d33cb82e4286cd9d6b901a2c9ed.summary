by @entity0 an ancestor of the elephant once believed to have disappeared from @entity3 before humans ever arrived there roamed the continent longer than previously thought – and was hunted by early man			0
archaeologists have discovered artifacts of the prehistoric @entity11 culture mingled with the bones of two gomphotheres – an ancient ancestor of the elephant – at an archaeological site in northwestern @entity17			1
the discovery suggests that the @entity11 – the earliest widespread group of hunter - gatherers to inhabit @entity3 – likely hunted and ate gomphotheres			1

gomphotheres were smaller than mammoths – about the same size as modern elephants			1
they once were widespread in @entity3 , but until now they seemed to have disappeared from the continent 's fossil record long before humans arrived in @entity3 , which happened some 13,000 to 13,500 years ago , during the @entity43			0
however , the bones that @entity45 and his colleagues uncovered date back 13,400 years , making them the last known gomphotheres in @entity3			2
beginning about 5 million years ago , they were gradually replaced by modern elephants the members of the @entity11 culture were already well - known as hunters of the gomphotheres ' cousins , mammoths and mastodons			1
although humans were known to have hunted gomphotheres in @entity60 and @entity61 , this is the first time a human - gomphothere connection has been made in @entity3 , says archaeologist @entity45 of the @entity63 , who co-authored a new paper on the findings , published this week in @entity66			0
' this is the first archaeological gomphothere found in @entity3 , and it 's the only one known , ' said @entity45 , a professor of anthropology and geology at the @entity63			0
@entity45 and colleagues from the @entity72 and @entity17 began excavating the skeletal remains of two juvenile gomphotheres in 2007 after ranchers alerted them that the bones had been found in northwestern @entity77 , @entity17			1
they admit they did n't know at first what kind of animal they were dealing with			0
' at first , just based on the size of the bone , we thought maybe it was a bison , because the extinct bison were a little bigger than our modern bison , ' @entity45 said			2
then , in 2008 , they discovered a jawbone with teeth , buried upside down in the dirt			0
' we finally found the mandible , and that 's what told the tale , ' @entity45 said			0
gomphotheres were smaller than mammoths – about the same size as modern elephants			1

although very difficult to shape into a tool , quartz was used by @entity11 tool makers at several sites			2

however , the bones that @entity45 and his colleagues uncovered date back 13,400 years , making them the last known gomphotheres in @entity3			2
the gomphothere remains were n't all @entity45 and his colleagues unearthed at the site , which they dubbed @entity104 – @entity120 for @entity121 – because of its remote location			0
as their excavation of the bones progressed , they also uncovered numerous @entity11 artifacts , including signature @entity11 projectile points , or spear tips , as well as cutting tools and flint flakes from stone tool - making			1
the @entity11 culture is so named for its distinctive stone tools , first discovered by archaeologists near @entity11 , @entity17 , in the 1930s			1
radiocarbon dating , done at the @entity63 , puts the @entity104 site at about 13,400 years old , making it one of the two oldest known @entity11 sites in @entity3 ; the other is the @entity142 site in north @entity143			2
the position and proximity of @entity11 weapon fragments relative to the gomphothere bones at the site suggest that humans did in fact kill the two animals there			1

of the seven @entity11 points found at the site , four were in place among the bones , including one with bone and teeth fragments above and below			1
the other three points had clearly eroded away from the bone bed and were found scattered nearby			0
' this is the first @entity172 , it 's the first archaeological gomphothere found in @entity3 , it 's the first evidence that people were hunting gomphotheres in @entity3 , and it adds another item to the @entity11 menu , ' @entity45 said .			1

gomphotheres were about the same size as modern elephants
