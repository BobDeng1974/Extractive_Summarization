the skylon air breathing rocket that could power a plane anywhere in the world in four hours and get to space in 15 minutes has moved a step closer to blasting off as a major project review said it was possible to operate the plane			1
a feasibility study carried out earlier this year as part of the @entity9 's ' @entity11 ' requirements for lowering the cost of @entity14 launch services by 2014 by using a radical new type of engine , have backed the plans - paving the way for it to blast off in 2019			1
the engine is called @entity20 , which stands for @entity21 , and was built by @entity23 firm @entity22			1
systems reusable design has the potential to undercut any other launch system currently in operation			0
once operational , @entity30 could be operated independently of subsidies			1
@entity47 could launch payloads of upto 15 tonnes into low earth orbit			0
also offer opportunities for spacecraft return , in - orbit servicing and human passengers			0
the € 1m @entity9 - ­ funded study identified proved that all current mission requirements for launches can be met			1
it also said vehicles operated from @entity14 's launch site in @entity34 , together with a reusable upper stage , can meet all @entity14 's launch operator requirements			0
reaction engines claims @entity20 can be used to help accelerate existing aircraft up to five times the speed of sound and plans to use the technology on a unique 3,500mph ' spaceplane ' called @entity30			1
now , it is believed the firm is putting the finishing touches to the plan to launch the aircraft - possibly in 2019			2
it has been earmarked as a ' high priority ' technology project by the @entity23 government following the favourable technical reports from @entity9 's propulsion experts			1
' for example , an aircraft carrying 300 passengers could go from @entity14 to @entity79 in about four hours , ' said @entity80 , chief engineer , in a video			2
the aircraft will be able to fly @entity82 5 - five times the speed of sound - because of the engine , named @entity20 , according to @entity80			1
modern - day traditional aviation engines have to carry tanks of liquid oxygen when travelling at more than 1,900mph because they ca n't ' breathe ' oxygen			2
@entity91 helps an engine to burn the fuel needed to power its propulsion			2
@entity96 's @entity20 design uses a system of pipes , filled with helium			1
the air passes through these pipes and the helium helps remove any heat and the oxygen is carried to the engine			2
once in space , the engine is capable of switching into rocket mode			1
this means the craft can travel in orbit for around 36 hours and used to launch satellites , for example			2
last year the @entity114 has announced plans to provide £ 60 million for a revolutionary new rocket enginecapable of taking people to @entity119 's stratosphere in just 15 minutes			1
@entity120 , minister for universities and science , said the investment in @entity20 would provide support at a ' crucial stage ' to allow a full - scale prototype to be built			1
' we 're investing £ 60 million in this and we expect them to go out and find private support as well , ' @entity120 told @entity131			0
the @entity132 , a passenger plane using the an aircraft carrying 300 passengers could go from @entity14 to @entity79 in about four hours the @entity137 vehicle , which is designed to be propelled by the @entity139 engine , has exceptional range ( ca			1
20,000 km both subsonic and supersonic ) and is therefore able to service a large number of routes whilst simultaneously avoiding supersonic overflight of populated areas and the related sonic booms that can be heard on the ground			0
its good subsonic performance enables it to service conventional subsonic overland routes			0
' but we 're backing this because it 's technology that has been tested in the lab , it 's been assessed by outside experts as right in principle			2
' now it needs to be built on a full - scale prototype before it can get commercial			0
' we think it 's right to support it through that crucial stage			0
a passenger version , called the @entity132 , is also unver development			1

@entity80 , founder of @entity22 , told @entity202 : ' @entity203 are stuck in a rut			0
the weight problem means it costs a great deal of money to launch even the smallest satellite			0
' the basic problem is that when you suck air into an engine at high speed it instantly heats up to @entity214 - which is unmanageably hot			1
' the challenge was to cool it back down to @entity217 in just a hundredth of a second - the time it takes to pass through the engine			1
' @entity80 continued : ' [ @entity20 ] would allow us to launch satellites far more cheaply , to build space stations or to create orbiting solar arrays that would beam power to earth			1
we could even construct spaceships for missions to other planets			0
' skylon is likely to be viewed a competitor to sir @entity233 's @entity232 business , in which people can experience six minutes of weightlessness during a sub-orbital spaceflights			0
sir @entity233 and his @entity232 company offer trips into space , that include six minutes of weightlessness , for around £ 121,000			1
@entity30 is expected to offer similar flights for cheaper , but has not announced any prices			1
figures from the company believe the skylon space place could cut the cost of space launches by around 95 per cent			1
the @entity20 engine has taken part in 100 successful test runs and its design was recently validated by the @entity9 to validate the design			1

the @entity20 rocket engine was created by @entity23 firm reaction engines
it can be fitted to planes and travel up to five times the speed of sound
the company wants to use the technology on a ' spaceplane ' called @entity30
passenger version called @entity132 could hold 300 passenger for *ultrafast* travel
tests *suggest* it could cut the cost of space launches by 95 *%*
@entity9 study has back the rocket plans to blast off as soon as 2020
