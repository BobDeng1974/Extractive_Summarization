by @entity0 published : 07:13 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 22 march 2013 a @entity2 artist has made an unsettling exhibition of ' matchstick men ' which show blackened out human faces atop huge matches			1
@entity8 had been experimenting with leftover art materials in his studio when he began his matchstick project with molds of @entity14 faces and bamboo			1
as the site - specific installation , entitled @entity17 , @entity8 used thick pieces of lumber to make the sculptures look more like real matchsticks			1
@entity2 artist @entity8 created the matchstick men installation by experimenting with leftover materials the @entity17 were created using the moulds of human faces on top of sturdy pieces of lumber to create the effect of oversized matches the installation includes a variety of bent , warped , and burnt pieces with haunting human faces , as well as oversized matchboxes			1
the installation is not a travelling exhibition and @entity8 has created numerous exhibitions in different places			1
the @entity40 will be on display at @entity42 in @entity43 as part of the show burnout which runs until april 20 @entity47 coffin : the artist insists that his @entity49 exhibition is not intended to reflect a view of @entity14 and says it is open to interpretation the installation is not a travelling exhibition and @entity8 says he will make more matchstick men while he is still able to create fresh collections he said he will continue to make new @entity58 installations as long as he is able to come up with fresh ideas for how to present them			1
@entity8 , who has lived in @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , leaves creative interpretation of the @entity67 exhibition up to the viewer			2
the 52 - year - old artist said : ' the installation can appear like a battlefield or just like some playground where someone played around with matches and dropped them			2
all the heads i 've used so far are from @entity14 people			0
' this sometimes leads to the assumption that this is a criticism of the @entity14 government			0
one can read it that way , but i think this metaphor could be used for any western system as well			0
' the matchboxes could be simply seen as formal elements within the installation , as coffins , or simply as matchboxes			2
i actually like to keep it open since i do n't like art that leaves no space for one 's own imagination			0
' the @entity40 will be on display at @entity42 in @entity43 as part of the show ' @entity99 ' which runs until april 20			0
some of the @entity40 are discarded over the floor , while others appear tucked away in an oversized matchbox			0
