they said : ' a man contacted police on 16 october to report an incident which allegedly took place in 1981			1
this report is being considered			2
' the allegation comes after a study showed a rise in reports of sexual offences ; which was put partly down to greater numbers coming forward to report historical sexual offences to the police following the @entity46 inquiry			0
the @entity47 said : ‘ there is evidence to suggest that these increases are partly a result of the @entity53 investigation , initiated in october 2012 and connected to the @entity55 inquiry			0
a study showed a rise in reports of historical sexual offences to the police following the @entity46 inquiry ‘ whilst some of these increases will be a direct consequence of the crimes reported as part of @entity53 there is also evidence to suggest that there has been a wider “ @entity68 effect ” , whereby there is increased willingness on the part of the victims to come forward and report historical sexual offences that are not directly connected to @entity73			0
‘ additionally the publicity surrounding @entity53 may have encouraged more victims to come forward and report more recent abuse cases			0
