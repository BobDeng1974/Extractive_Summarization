more than a quarter of people in @entity1 have never heard of out - of - hours services and have no idea how to see a gp on evenings or weekends millions still have no idea how to see a gp when they fall ill at evenings and weekends , mps warn today			1
more than a quarter have never heard of out - of - hours services – a decade after they came in – and the system remains patchy and confusing			1
in some areas , four in ten who did manage to find a doctor said the experience was poor or dreadful			1
mps on the @entity18 say the system is too complicated , highly variable and means many patients wrongly end up in @entity20			2
@entity21 have been able to opt out of providing care at evenings and weekends since 2004 under a @entity24 - negotiated deal that also saw their average salaries exceed £ 100,000			1
in most areas , the work is subcontracted to private firms which employ local doctors , or locums , from elsewhere in @entity32 or abroad			2
the firms include @entity34 and @entity35 , which have been accused of running care on the cheap and employing a single gp or nurse to cover of hundreds of thousands of patients			2
the @entity17 ’ report cites figures showing that 26 per cent of patients have not heard of @entity4 out - of - hours services – rising to 43 per cent of those aged 18 to 24			1
@entity46 bosses had hoped to make it easier with the launch of the 111 helpline , which is meant to offer advice round - the - clock			2
yet 18 months on , a third of patients do not know it exists or do not understand what it is for			0
mps also warn that the standards of out - of - hours care vary unacceptably across the country			1
the worst is @entity59 , @entity60 , where 41 per cent of patients who used services rated them as ‘ poor ’ or ‘ very poor ’			1
the report also draws attention to the fact that some @entity21 are handing out contracts to out - of - hours firms they own shares in			1
@entity24 mp @entity70 , who chairs the committee , said : ‘ people turn to out - of - hours gp services when they are worried about their own health or that of family or friends , and want urgent advice or treatment			1
however , the urgent and emergency care system is complex and people struggle to know which is the right service to use			1
‘ too many people are unaware of the different urgent care options and of how to contact them			2
as a result of the confusion , too many go to @entity20 when they do not need to			0
’ four in ten people who did manage to find a doctor described the experience as poor or dreadful ( file picture ) @entity92 , chief executive of the @entity93 , said : ‘ we are worried about patients being seen by @entity21 who know nothing about them and appear to have little interest in finding out what is wrong with them			1
it is probably unrealistic to expect a return to the days when family doctors carried out their own night and weekend calls , but at the very least @entity32 should be able to demonstrate that patients are receiving safe and effective care			0
’ dr @entity105 , chairman of the @entity107 ’s @entity106 said : ‘ many gps are working hard to deliver out of hours to patients but they are being undermined by an increasingly chaotic and underfunded system			2
‘ with patient demand continuing to rise , especially from an ageing population , this situation is only likely to deteriorate			0
’ @entity115 @entity114 ( pictured ) said the @entity46 must be given an extra £ 1.5billion next year the @entity46 must be given an extra £ 1.5billion next year with a further £ 1billion a year thereafter , a health minister says			0
liberal democrat @entity114 said this had to be a ‘ high priority ’ and delaying the issue would only betray patients			0
the government will unveil its @entity46 spending plans in the @entity123 on december 3			0
only last month , @entity46 bosses said they needed at least an extra £ 8billion by 2020 to meet the demands of the ageing population			0
mr @entity114 said : ‘ too often politicians take the easy way out and delay big spending decisions in the hope they become someone else ’s problem			0
doing that would betray patients			0
' the @entity46 needs significantly more money to help trusts adapt to the changing needs of our population and it ca n’t afford to wait			0
‘ that ’s why securing extra money for the @entity46 must be a priority for the whole government			0
' a significant amount of that needs to go on improving mental health services , especially for children and young people			1
