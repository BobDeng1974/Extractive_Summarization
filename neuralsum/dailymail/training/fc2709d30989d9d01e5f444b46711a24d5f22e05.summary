@entity1 is facing a rise in hospital - acquired infections because its cash - strapped health service can not afford basic supplies such as gloves , gowns and alcohol wipes ( picture posed by model ) with fewer doctors and nurses to look after more patients , and hospitals running low on cash for supplies , risks are being taken even with basic hygiene , said @entity38 , director of the @entity39 ( @entity39 )			1
' i have seen places ... where the financial situation did not allow even for basic requirements like gloves , gowns and alcohol wipes , ' mr @entity38 said after a two - day trip to @entity47 , where he visited hospitals and other healthcare facilities			2
' we already knew @entity1 is in a very bad situation regarding antibiotic resistant infections , and after visiting hospitals there i ’m now really convinced we have reached one minute to midnight in this battle , ' he said			2
mr @entity38 said the situation means patients with highly - infectious diseases like tuberculosis ( @entity59 ) may not get the treatment they need , raising the risk that dangerous drug - resistant forms will tighten their grip on @entity10			2

@entity1 could soon face even more problems with its health care system if it runs out of money to buy drugs			1
another health official who asked to remain anonymous said a senior @entity47 hospital worker had told him there was no budget left for supplies at that hospital , so all its drug purchases were on credit			2
@entity106 , the @entity107 ’s chief scientist and representative to the @entity109 , told @entity110 he too was worried about the rate of hospital - acquired infections in @entity1			1
