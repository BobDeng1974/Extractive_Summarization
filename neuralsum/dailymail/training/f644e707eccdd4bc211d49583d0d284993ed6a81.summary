@entity0 once again stole the show by scoring four goals - including a perfect hat - trick - as @entity4 continued their strong start under new manager @entity7 by sweeping aside @entity8 in @entity9			1
just three days after @entity4 saw off @entity13 in the @entity14 , @entity0 , the country 's 22 - year - old captain and talisman , was unstoppable after opening the scoring in the first half			2
@entity8 started brightly , and despite resting their most established stars such as @entity69 and @entity70 , the @entity8 caused @entity4 some troubles in the first half			1
but @entity0 was a constant threat , ably assisted by @entity26 , who looked to have gained confidence from his two goals against @entity13 in @entity76 , and was far more involved in the build - up play than in the @entity78			0
and it was from one such moment of combination that @entity4 went ahead after 18 minutes			2
the @entity82 forward almost got on the scoresheet early on , bending a beautiful free kick over the wall only to see it hit the crossbar @entity87 defender @entity52 was one of just three @entity89 starters in a slightly weakened eleven , to play their club football in @entity91 @entity94 full - back @entity92 challenges @entity52 as @entity8 made a decent start to the first half before being blown away by @entity0 even before that the @entity82 striker had shown that he was always the most dangerous player on the pitch , striking the angle of post and bar with a beautiful free kick			1
@entity8 continued to make their opponents work , @entity60 proving a handful up front and @entity55 providing energy from midfield , but they rarely forced @entity40 in the @entity4 goal to make a save , as @entity7 's side began to take control in @entity9			2
and in the second half it was the @entity0 show , the 22 - year - old sliding home from a brilliant @entity29 pass , tucking home a rebound after the @entity30 midfielder had seen a shot saved , and then rising highest at the back post to score a fourth			1
@entity8 had no answer to his magnificence , neither preventing the supply of ball , or , as a more experienced and perhaps more cynical side might have done , stopping him with fouls before he got into full flight			0
instead they stood off the @entity82 star , and he needed no second invitation			0
with the likes of @entity48 , @entity47 and @entity29 , and later @entity133 and @entity134 , feeding his runs , @entity0 could even have had more			0
with the score at 2 - 0 he was played through on the left side , but missed the target after cutting cleverly back inside			0
it mattered little though , as the chances kept coming for @entity4 's favourite son , who now has 40 goals in just 58 games for his @entity144 dropped deep and threaded a delightful ball through the @entity8 defence , and @entity0 , quicker and stronger than his marker , collected it , before rounding keeper @entity19 and slotting home			1
@entity0 's first goal came after some slick interplay			0
@entity0 's movement and more on out brilliant @entity154 @entity7 ( right ) is enjoying a good start to his second spell in charge of @entity4 , but did n't seem overjoyed after @entity0 's first goal the @entity158 celebrate going in front in the 18th minute , and the @entity161 semi-finalists looked comfortable from that point on the @entity82 forward runs away to celebrate after effectively ending the match as a contest with his second goal in @entity9 it was a magnificent display from a player on top of his game as @entity8 failed to cope with @entity0 's direct running and clinical finishing @entity0 celebrates after bagging his hat - trick goal after @entity19 had parried @entity29 's shot from the edge of the penalty box @entity8 had no answer to @entity0 's movement , skill and finishing , as he scored a perfect hat - trick in his one - man demolition job @entity133 , who hit the bar in the build - up to @entity0 's third goal , congratulates his skipper after @entity0 wrapped up the scoring with his fourth @entity186 - midable @entity0 continues @entity4 run a young supporter shows his love for @entity8 , and in particular @entity190 star @entity69 , who was kept on the bench in the first half the majority of the fans in the @entity195 in @entity9 were backing @entity8 , but many seemed excited to see @entity4 in the flesh			1

@entity0 puts @entity4 ahead in @entity9 after 18 minutes
