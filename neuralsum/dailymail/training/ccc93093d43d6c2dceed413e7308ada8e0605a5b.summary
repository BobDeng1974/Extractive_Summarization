his withering criticism came after the @entity16 ’s second - in - command warned that the @entity17 would struggle to respond to future emergencies if operations against colonel @entity20 dragged on beyond the summer			0
air chief marshal sir @entity21 said fighting simultaneous conflicts in @entity23 and the @entity24 was placing ‘ huge ’ demands on airmen and aircraft			1
morale in the @entity16 was ‘ fragile ’ and ‘ fighting spirit ’ was threatened by being overworked and the impact of the @entity31 ’s unpopular defence cuts , he added			1
air chief marshal @entity21 ’s assessment - contained in a leaked briefing paper to mps - was the second time in a month a senior officer has cast serious doubt on the government ’s defence strategy			1
admiral sir @entity41 , the head of the @entity42 , claimed last week that @entity44 ’s security would be at risk if the @entity8 conflict lasted more than six months			2
he said ministers faced having to make ‘ challenging decisions ’ - including the possibility of withdrawing ships currently patrolling home waters			2
mr @entity3 ’s woes deepened last night when general sir @entity53 , the head of the @entity54 , appeared to question @entity56 ’s timeline for withdrawing @entity44 troops from @entity23			2
the chief of the general staff told a @entity60 2 documentary to be broadcast tonight wed that ‘ we shall find out nearer the time ’ if the 2014 deadline was implemented			1

’ rebel fighters fire a grad rocket at the front line west of @entity78 yesterday			0
it is unlikely that air chief marshal @entity21 will face the same reprimand sir @entity81 on - going : rebel fighters fire a grad rocket at the front line west of @entity78 , @entity8			1
the @entity16 chief 's comments add to growing concerns about the length of the @entity8 operation map detailing control of major towns and events in @entity8 the @entity94 insisted that @entity96 general sir @entity95 and @entity97 - hauled into @entity98 last week for a dressing down - were ‘ absolutely clear that we are able to keep up this mission for as long as is necessary ’			1
he said : ‘ i ’m absolutely confident that we can keep this pressure up			0
we can maintain this mission for as long as necessary			0
@entity103 is on our side			0
’ mr @entity3 said that airmen ’s morale and enthusiasm appeared ‘ extremely high ’ when he had spoken to them			2
but air chief marshal @entity21 warned mps that morale was ‘ fragile ’ and that many areas of the @entity16 were are ‘ running hot ’			1

air chief marshal sir @entity21 , right , described morale as ' fragile ' he added : ‘ morale remains fragile			1
although fighting spirit remains positive , this assessment will be challenged by individual harmony targets as @entity134 endures [ after september ]			2
‘ there is decreasing satisfaction with the remunerative offer , and allowances cut and the pay freeze continues to bite			2
’ the @entity16 will be cut by 5,000 troops over the next three years , reducing its strength to 32,000 personnel			0
the cuts made by the government - another 12,000 @entity54 and @entity42 personnel will be axed alongside warships , aircraft and tanks - had led to dire warnings of the consequences for @entity44 ’s safety			0
critics believe mr @entity3 should reopen the @entity153 in light of its growing irrelevance in light of ‘ @entity159 ’ uprisings			1
wing commander @entity160 , director of the @entity161 , said : ‘ they are rightly saying to @entity3 , “ yes , oh leader , we will do what you want but we ca n’t do it for long because you have hobbled our services			0
‘ we simply can not fight war after war after war because there is a bill to be paid in terms of resources and rest and recuperation of our troops			0
