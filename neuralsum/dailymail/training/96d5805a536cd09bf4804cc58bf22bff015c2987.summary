there is no link between mobile phones and any health problems , a decade - long report has concluded			1
the study also found no evidence that exposure to base station emissions during pregnancy increases the risk of childhood leukaemia			1
the @entity13 and @entity14 programme was the @entity16 ’s largest research programme to look at the possible health risks associated with mobile phone technology			1
there is no link between mobile phone use and cancer , new research suggests professor @entity24 , chairman of @entity25 , said : ‘ when the @entity25 programme was first set up , there were many scientific uncertainties about possible health risks from mobile phones and related technology			2
‘ this independent programme is now complete , and despite exhaustive research , we have found no evidence of risks to health from the radio waves produced by mobile phones or their base stations			1
‘ thanks to the research conducted within the programme , we can now be much more confident about the safety of modern telecommunications systems			2
’ the £ 13.6 million , 11 year programme has been jointly funded by the @entity16 government and the telecommunications industry			1
its findings support 2012 research which showed mobile and @entity54 technology does n't cause cancer and causes no damage to health			2
there is also no link between exposure to power lines during pregnancy and childhood leukaemia after assessing health hazards from low - level electromagnetic fields generated by radio transmitters , researchers at the @entity65 found there is no scientific evidence that exposure poses a health risk			1
these electromagnetic fields are found around mobile phones , wireless phones and networks , mobile phone base stations , broadcasting transmitters and other communications equipment			0
the latest research also supports a 2011 study from @entity81 which found that living close to a mobile phone mast does not increase a child 's chance of developing a brain tumour or a tumour of the central nervous system			0
in 2011 the @entity88 suggested that people try to text rather than making phone calls to reduce their chance of developing a brain tumour from phone use study author professor @entity94 of @entity81 , said : ' people are worried that living near a mobile phone mast might affect their children 's health			0
' we looked at this question with respect to risk of cancers in young children			0
' we found no pattern to suggest that the children of mums living near a base station during pregnancy had a greater risk of developing cancer than those who lived elsewhere			1
' research released just last week also revealed that children who live near overhead power lines do not have an increased risk of leukaemia			2
the @entity118 researchers studied 16,500 children with the cancer in the @entity16 and found living near power lines did not increase risk of the disease			1
despite all of this evidence , some people may remain unconvinced			0
in 2011 the @entity88 warned mobile phone users to limit their use of the devices as they could cause cancer			0
the @entity88 suggested people use hands - free kits and that they text people instead of calling them to reduce their exposure to the phone			0
the comments were made after earlier research which suggested that just half an hour 's mobile phone use a day could increase the risk of a brain tumour by 40 per cent .			0

there is ' no evidence ' to suggest that exposure to base station emissions during pregnancy increases the risk of childhood leukaemia
there is also no evidence that shows they cause any other health problems
