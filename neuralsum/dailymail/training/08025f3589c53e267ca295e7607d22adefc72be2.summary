by @entity0 judge @entity1 said the man 's smoking habit was another example of him being unable to give up ' habit - forming behaviour ' , including smoking cannabis and excessive drinking a man was stopped from adopting his three - year - old grandson after a family court judge said he was concerned about his smoking habit			1
judge @entity1 said several areas of concern had been raised about the man ’s suitability for adopting , including drug use spanning three decades and smoking			0
the judge said the grandfather 's smoking was ' significant ' in the context of ' his ability to give up habit - forming behaviour '			1
this included a 30 - year cannabis habit and worries over excessive drinking - as well as being unable to quit smoking , even with professional help			1
there were also concerns raised over domestic violence and problems with anxiety and depression			0
judge @entity37 , who said no - one in the case could be identified , concluded that the little boy should be placed for adoption			1
in a written ruling , released after the family court hearing in @entity43 , @entity37 said @entity44 had asked him to make an order allowing the young boy to be placed for adoption			0
the council , which was named in the ruling , had responsibility for the child			0
but the case had come about after the boy ’s 17 - year - old mother , who was 14 when she gave birth , opposed the council ’s application			2
she suggested that her father and her father ’s partner should care for the young boy , if she were not allowed			0
but judge @entity37 said an assessment of the grandfather ’s suitability had raised a ' number of areas of concern '			2
this included a history of domestic violence , worries about excessive drinking , problems with anxiety and depression , drug abuse and smoking , the ruling said			1
the grandfather had told the court how he had been a smoker for several years and had used cannabis regularly for about 30 years			0
he said he had not used cannabis since late 2013 - when he had ' decided ' to give up his habit			0
but the judge said it was significant that the man had been unable to quit smoking - despite seeking help from a gp			1
judge @entity37 said : ' ( @entity90 ) has been a smoker for several years			2
@entity44 , whose headquarters are pictured , had responsibility for the young boy and asked the judge to make an order so the child could be placed for adoption ' whilst smoking is not necessarily a contra - indicator to ( his ) suitability as a long - term carer for ( his grandson ) , it is significant in the context of his ability to give up habit - forming behaviour even with professional support			1
' he added : ' ( his ) inability to give up his long - term smoking habit even with professional support casts some doubt on the reliability of his assertion that in december 2013 he gave up a 30 - year cannabis dependency by sheer force of will - power without any professional support			1
' judge @entity37 said social workers had flagged concerns about the mother ’s ' drug abuse ' and lifestyle			2
he said the evidence raised ' very real doubts ' about the capacity of the mother or the grandfather and his partner to care for the little boy			0
he added : ' i have come to the conclusion that in this case the evidence points very clearly to placement for adoption			0

smoking showed man 's inability to stop ' habit - forming behaviour ' , judge said
other ' habits ' included excessive drinking and a 30 - year cannabis use
judge @entity37 said he also *failed* to quit smoking even with professional help
man and grandson , who is now placed for adoption , can not be named
