by @entity0 published : 06:46 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 03:36 est , 17 may 2013 tweet : mrs @entity2 , the speaker 's wife , has always denied that her @entity1 was defamatory a tweet sent by @entity2 pointed the ‘ finger of blame ’ at a @entity10 peer , suggesting he was a sex offender , the @entity4 heard yesterday			1
the speaker ’s wife arrived at court in a revealing flowery dress and bright red shoes to hear lawyers argue over her message and whether it was defamatory			0
a @entity20 investigation aired on november 2 last year accused a politician of allegedly abusing boys at a @entity24 care home – but did not give a name			0
two days later , the speaker ’s wife tweeted : ‘ why is @entity30 trending ? * innocent face * ’ , in an apparent reference to a rumour he was the man involved			1
the former @entity10 treasurer denied all the allegations and the alleged victim later retracted his account of life at @entity37 care home in the 70s and 80s			0
@entity30 threatened legal proceedings against those who he claimed had defamed him			0
he has already received six - figure payouts from the @entity43 and @entity44			0
@entity2 would not comment on the case , but denies libel and claims her tweet did not defame the peer as it was posed as an innocent question			1
leading libel judge @entity50 presided over the argument about the ‘ natural and ordinary meaning ’ and ‘ innuendo ’ of the tweet			2
sir @entity55 , representing @entity30 , said : ‘ the tweet , by itself , suggests that “ @entity30 ” has done something wrong			2
the inclusion of the words “ innocent face ” was giving a nudge and a wink to readers			1
’ he added : ‘ what was the tweet about , if it was not pointing the finger of blame at @entity30 ? ’ @entity68 , for @entity69 , said it was ‘ an entirely neutral statement ’ and not ‘ objectionable ’			2
she was in the @entity4 today as a judge decides on the meaning of her allegedly libellous tweet about the furore			2
sir @entity55 said it would be difficult to think of a more serious meaning than the one advanced by @entity30 , who was not in court			2
he told mr @entity50 that his case was founded on the circumstances in which mrs @entity2 decided to tweet the peer 's name - the media frenzy over a story that spread ' like wildfire '			1
it was also necessary to consider the words themselves , in isolation			0
' the tweet , by itself , suggests that " @entity30 " has done something wrong			2
drawing attention to someone and then adding the expression " innocent face " hints at wrongdoing and negates any suggestion that the tweet was a neutral query to which the defendant was looking for an answer			1
' the inclusion of the words " innocent face " was giving a nudge and a wink to readers			1
' he said a user of @entity1 was not someone who ignored what was happening in the world - he or she , far from being a hermit or shut off from the media , was inquisitive and it literate			0
' in short , there was a prominent and salacious story in the media , and what was missing was the name of the abuser at its centre			0
' sir @entity55 said that , against the backdrop of almost saturation news coverage , mrs @entity2 tweeted @entity30 's name - a man who fitted the description of the unnamed person at the centre of the controversy			1
the addition of ' innocent face ' underpinned the connection of him to wrongdoing and the hypothetical reasonable reader would have put two and two together and understood the connection to the abuse allegations , he added			1
' put another way , what was the tweet about , if it was not pointing the finger of blame at @entity30 ? ' dispute : mrs @entity2 has always denied that her tweet about @entity30 was defamatory interpretation : the tweet at the centre of the @entity4 libel battle mrs @entity2 's counsel , @entity68 , has told the judge that she promptly tweeted her apologies , provided letters apologising for the distress caused and making clear that the underlying allegations were untrue , and made an offer to settle the case which had not been withdrawn			1
he said that the tweet posed a question and contained an implied statement of fact that @entity30 was trending , but this was entirely neutral and no more objectionable than the statement to precisely the same effect on the @entity1 homepage			1
the words and punctuation of ' innocent face ' were merely an indication that the question should be read with a deadpan emphasis or tone , comparable with stage directions such as sotto voce or a notation on a musical score			1
dispute : @entity30 is suing mrs @entity2 for defamation in the @entity4 over the tweet which he says wrongly implicated him in child abuse			1
she denies this @entity30 's distress at the tweet was entirely comprehensible on a human level , he added			1
mrs @entity2 drew attention to the fact that he was trending but if readers of the @entity1 were prompted by the question she posed to find tweets which defamed the peer , that was not a matter which should lead to damages against her			1
it was not accepted that the background events to the claim were notorious general knowledge			0
@entity30 's career , distinguished as it was , ended 20 years ago and the @entity20 broadcast , while of real interest to some , did not attract a particularly large audience			2
the evidence of publicity given to the allegations fell far short of proving that on the day of the tweet - november 4 2012 - the fact of the @entity20 allegations , let alone the description of the individual concerned , was general knowledge			0
the extent and nature of the coverage changed markedly the day after the tweet following an interview with the prime minister on @entity44 and then again after the retraction of the original allegation by @entity20 's source			0
' whereas later coverage might fairly be described as " blanket " and such as to make the events " notorious " or general knowledge , this was not so at the time of the tweet			0
' he said that , even if the tweet was to be taken as referring to some form of controversy surrounding @entity30 , it was a form of reportage , making no attempt to take a side in that controversy , but merely noting that it existed			0
the hearing is only concerned with the actual meaning of the words complained of - both a natural and ordinary meaning and an innuendo meaning			0
if the judge rules in @entity30 's favour , there will be a hearing at a later date on the appropriate level of damages unless the two sides agree a settlement			2
the judge reserved his decision to a later unspecified date			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
