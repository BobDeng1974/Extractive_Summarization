after @entity1 broke her back in a horrific fall at home , she was warned she might never walk again			1
a vertebra in the 26 - year - old ’s spine cracked and burst open tearing ligaments and tendons which could have left her paralysed			1
doctors feared the worst , describing the break as ‘ toe curling ’ , but remarkably , ms @entity1 has been left with no lasting injuries			1
@entity1 , 26 , tripped and fell down a flight of stairs while trying to get to the bathroom in the night she said : ‘ i ca n’t believe how lucky i am			1
when i first went to @entity17 they thought i ’d just banged myself up a bit , but as soon as my scans came back all hell broke loose			2
‘ everyone presumed the worst and they told me that in a worst case scenario , i could be paralysed			2
i was terrified - i thought i ’d never walk again			2
‘ they did some tests and luckily i had some feeling in my lower legs so it was a good sign , but i never thought i ’d have recovered so quickly			0
‘ a doctor who saw me had been treating someone who ’d had the same type of fall as me - but he ’d been referred to another hospital because he ’s never going to walk again			1
ms @entity1 , from @entity33 , had to undergo a seven hour operation in which a cage was built around her spine to stabilise the fragile break of her t - 12 vertebra			1
she also had a bone graft taken from her pelvis			0
she was initially told that it would take up to six months for her to recover but she amazed doctors by walking again within ten days			1
she told @entity43 , her local newspaper in @entity44 : ‘ my surgeon told me i was a hair ’s breadth away from being paralysed – the break was crazy			2
in the fall ms @entity1 shattered a vertebra in her lower back and doctors said she was a ' hair 's breadth ' from being paralysed ‘ he said it made his toes curl and he did n’t know how on earth i was walking			1
‘ the t - 12 vertebra is where you do all your bending and moving for things like putting your shoes on			1
the way i ’d fallen it had basically burst and all the ligaments around it had been damaged			1
’ ms @entity1 , who works in finance , suffered the injury falling down the steep stairs in her home during the night			1
she said : ‘ i woke up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet but i did n’t turn on the light			2
following her operation , ms @entity1 was initially told it would take six months for her to recover ‘ i missed my footing on the way to the bathroom and the next thing i knew i was in a pile at the bottom of the stairs			1
‘ i did n’t really know what had happened but i could feel a searing pain right in the middle of my back			2
‘ thanks to the adrenaline i was able to crawl over to my sofa where i rang @entity88			0
i explained what had happened and they told me to call an ambulance immediately			0
‘ on the way to the hospital there were 101 things going through my mind			2
’ at @entity98 , medics initially planned to send her home with painkillers , but a last minute x-ray revealed the true extent of her injuries			1
‘ i was in a bed behind a curtain waiting to go home when the doctor came in and told me he ’d got some bad news - i ’d fractured my spine			0
‘ i started to panic and went to get up but i was told that i needed to find a comfortable position and stay there			0
‘ it was important that i did n’t move at all because the break was so unstable it was very scary			0
’ after ms @entity1 ’s diagnosis an initial assessment by surgeons suggested that she may recover , but her future was still uncertain			1
‘ they gave me three options , ’ she said			0
‘ i was told that i could do nothing , have a full body brace , or have surgery			0
i knew surgery was the best option so i was transferred to @entity125			0
‘ the journey there was agony , but the worst part was that my operation was n’t for three days , and for that whole time i had to lie flat barely moving a muscle and in incredible pain			1
i just felt so helpless			0
’ she underwent a seven - hour operation to stabilise her spine and was walking again ten days later luckily ms @entity1 ’s seven - hour operation was a success			1
‘ i woke up and straight away i knew things were better			0
i was still in pain , but i knew the pain was as a result of the surgery , not the fall			0
‘ then the day after the operation the physio came to try and get me on my feet			0
ms @entity1 's surgeon said she was lucky not to have damaged her spinal cord ‘ it was excruciating - it felt like every bone in my body was popping out - but i was determined to do it			1
‘ i had the surgery on a wednesday , by the saturday i was walking around and four days later i ’d been discharged			1
‘ i do n’t think anyone could quite believe it , ’ she said			0
she added : ‘ when i look back at what happened now , it was all a bit of a whirlwind			0
‘ i knew that no one else was going to get me walking again apart from me , so i just had to do it			0
ms @entity1 ’s surgeon at @entity125 in @entity162 , mr @entity163 , said : ‘ @entity1 had an extremely unstable injury to her back following an accident			1
‘ luckily , there was no injury to her spinal cord so we could stabilise her spine effectively			2
‘ i am very pleased with the outcome			0
‘ @entity1 was very brave and positive throughout , and all credit goes to her			2
’ ms @entity1 explained to @entity43 that she can now look after herself again and that her recovery is thanks to the surgery that mr @entity163 carried out			2
she said : ‘ he held my life in his hands and he saved it			0
i will always have a lasting memory and two scars to remind me , but i have my life and my legs			0
