@entity7 and @entity8 , who claim to be distantly related to the last @entity10 king , have spent years researching the mystery of his fate after his death			0

pictured is the scene depicted on the @entity25 tapestry they say there are four surviving , intact @entity30 stone coffins which have not even been seen since the 19th century in a vault under the church			1
the pair are now calling on the vicar to open the vault and say they also expect to find the bones of his partner @entity18 and his two brothers			0
mr @entity7 , a retired police detective , said : ' @entity2 , his long - term wife and lover @entity18 and his two brothers , @entity45 and @entity46 , all , in fact , lie in a long forgotten vault at @entity48			1
' there are four surviving , intact @entity30 stone coffins which have not even been seen since the 19th century			1
' it is our firm belief that , once an archaeological investigation is undertaken , at the very least , we will find @entity2 's wife , @entity18 , who was venerated as a medieval saint , and very probably also @entity2 and his two brothers			1
' the amateur historians believe @entity2 was buried at @entity59 ( pictured )			1
' it is our firm belief that , once an archaeological investigation is undertaken , at the very least , we will find @entity2 's wife , @entity18 , ' they said @entity7 and @entity8 , who claim to be distantly related to the last @entity10 king , have spent years researching the mystery of his fate after his death			1
pictured is a drawing by @entity68 depicting the coronation of @entity2 excavators will carry out a scan of the grounds of @entity73 in @entity74 ( pictured ) where the majority of researchers believe @entity2 is buried shot through the eye by an arrow , he died at the hands of four @entity30 knights brutally dismembering his body - or so almost 950 years of history dictates			1
but archaeologists are now claiming @entity2 may have survived the @entity5 , and lived out his years before quietly dying of old age			2
the alternative version of events , put forward in a 12th century document housed in the @entity88 , discounts the @entity30 ' portrayal of his death in the @entity90			2
the artwork , long considered an accurate depiction of the @entity93 , shows @entity2 clutching at an arrow in his eye as four @entity30 knights hack at his body			1
but now a team of historians , who discovered the remains of @entity99 in a municipal car park in @entity101 in 2012 , are eager to dispel the long - accepted story			0
@entity103 and @entity104 , whose efforts were applauded around the world for the discovery , will carry out an underground scan of @entity110 at @entity73 in @entity74 , the supposed site of @entity2 's tomb , to look for his remains			2
the cousins are convinced @entity2 's body was carried to @entity16 , in @entity17 , by his grieving lover @entity18 and buried at @entity19 @entity2 ( pictured ) was born in the early 1020s , the son of @entity118 , @entity119 born : c.1020 parents : @entity121 , @entity119 , and @entity122 of @entity123 relation to @entity125 : husband of the 30th great - grandmother @entity128 : @entity129 ascended to the throne : january 5 , 1066 crowned : january 6 , 1066 at @entity131 , aged c.43 married : ( 1 ) @entity133 ( @entity135 - neck ) , daughter of @entity137 ( 2 ) @entity139 widow of @entity141 ap @entity132 children : 1 or 2 sons and a number of illegitimate children died : october 14 , 1066 at @entity146 , @entity147 , of wounds following the @entity5 reigned for : 9 months , and 8 days but the vicar of the church the @entity151 said he is ' unconvinced ' by their claims and has refused permission for an archaeological investigation			1
@entity156 said : ' i am unconvinced by mr @entity7 's claims and do not judge that it would be appropriate to devote the time and energy needed to seek permission from the diocese and then execute an investigation of this speculation , given the many demands of contemporary ministry , schools work , pastoral care , worship and mission here , to which priority must be given			2
' local historian @entity173 said : ' this really is of such historical importance that no objection whatsoever should be raised against a full archaeological survey of the vault and its four coffins , and that their contents be examined by medical experts			2
' @entity16 could well find itself the centre of world attention if the remains of @entity2 , his brothers and mistress are found beneath @entity48 's			0
' stranger things have happened - who would ever have believed that another past king of @entity191 , @entity99 , would be found beneath a car park in @entity101 ? ' the reasoning behind mr @entity7 and mr @entity8 's claims remains unclear , and @entity195 is yet to get a response the cousins			0
a spokesman for the @entity199 said : ' we are aware of the @entity202 's views about mr @entity7 's request which quite correctly gives priority to the interests of a busy community of worshipping @entity207 , serving @entity208 and the people of @entity16			0
' these views would be taken into account and given due weight if there were any case lodged in the @entity215 , which at present there is not			0
' the case would be considered like any case asking for an investigation of the buried remains of any person , loved by their family in life and reverentially buried at death			0
' were a case to be brought , it would be in all likelihood considered by the diocesan chancellor , a judge			0
