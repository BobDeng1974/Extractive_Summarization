on wednesday he appeared to lay that burden at @entity2 ' feet			2
' the last five years have been defined by significant strides and by lasting reforms even in the face , even in the face of unprecedented , unwarranted , ugly and divisive adversity , ' @entity1 said			2
' if you do n’t believe that , you look at the way – forget about me , forget about me – you look at the way the attorney general of the @entity25 was treated yesterday by a @entity59 committee			1

' what attorney general has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment ? what president has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment ?

@entity12 ( r ) has made his career about addressing racism -- often aided by substantial payments from companies his organization targets -- providing @entity1 with a perfect forum to complain that the @entity2 targeted him because he 's black lashing out : when @entity97 @entity164 rep. @entity164 brought up @entity61 ' criminal contempt citation against @entity166 , the attorney general snapped , ' you do n't want to go there , buddy !

@entity1 was expected in some corners to cancel his speech following revelations earlier in the week that @entity12 , now an @entity188 host , became a mob informant in the 1980s following a police sting operation in which he was caught trying to buy large amounts of illegal drugs from an undercover officer .			2

house speaker @entity0 insisted that attacks on attorney general @entity1 have nothing to do with the color of his skin
one *congressman* said tuesday that @entity1 belonged ' in jail ' instead of answering questions , since he had been held in @entity203
@entity1 carped wednesday night to a civil rights group that no other attorney general – or president – has had to face that level of disrespect
@entity0 's office *proudly* distributed the speaker 's speech , but left off his declaration that ' there is no issue of race here '
