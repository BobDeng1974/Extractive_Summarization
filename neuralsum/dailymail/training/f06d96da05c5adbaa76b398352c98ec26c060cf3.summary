by @entity1 reporter published : 02:37 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 02:39 est , 6 november 2012 the clothes may make the man , but what about the man behind the clothes ? @entity7 , the @entity9 , @entity10 - based tailor to the rich and famous , has been altering suits for decades , and has a host of celebrity clients from the music , sports and political arenas			1
but life has not always been easy for mr @entity7 , who had his world turned upside down when he was sent to the @entity20 prison camp by the @entity21 during the @entity22 in 1943			1
mr @entity7 , 84 , told the @entity38 : ' i did n’t know how to wash shirts - we had a maid			1
and i ripped his collar … first , he whipped me , then he gave me the shirt			0
' honing his sewing skills and fixing the attire to fit him properly , mr @entity7 used the shirt as a status symbol , wearing it in place of his prison garb			2
he had been moved to the @entity52 camp before he was freed by allied forces			0
when freed , he was alongside another young prisoner , writer @entity55 winner @entity54			0
master of the trade : the first shirt mr @entity7 ever touched with a needle and thread belonged to an @entity35 guard who had given it to him to wash mr @entity7 was 19 years old when he arrived in the @entity64 in 1947			1
today , he is showing few signs that he is ready to retire			0
the @entity38 reported that suits at @entity7 ’s @entity9 headquarters cost anywhere from $ 1,800 to $ 2,700			2
in the past , mr @entity7 ’s prowess as a tailor has been sought out by some of @entity64 ’s biggest names , including @entity73 and @entity74			1
but perhaps no name is bigger than the president of the @entity64			2
wall of fame : on the wall in mr @entity7 's office are photos and letter signed by @entity73 and @entity83 , among others high - priced : suits at @entity7 's @entity9 headquarters cost anywhere from $ 1,800 to $ 2,700 as a young tailor in the 50s , his bosses gave him the privilege to measure @entity92 , the same man who shook his hand as a general outside the liberated @entity52 camp years earlier			1
@entity92 may have been mr @entity7 ’s first president , but he would n’t be the last , as @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity83 also bought suits from him , according to the @entity99			2
he had an appointment with president @entity101 at the @entity102 on september 11 , 2001 - a meeting that had to be rescheduled after the terror attacks			0
right at home : mr @entity7 is pictured in his @entity9 , @entity10 , headquarters president @entity107 is likely among mr @entity7 ’s clientele as well , but the humble tailor will not say so , citing a personal policy not to speak about a client unless that client has first spoken of him			0
other clients include other key political figures as gen @entity115 , @entity117 @entity116 and @entity10 mayor @entity118			0

@entity7 , 84 , was *imprisoned* at *infamous* @entity122 camp in 1943
later made his way to the @entity64 , where he built his clothing *empire* that boasts many celebrity clients and presidents
