the @entity0 in @entity1 is lagging behind @entity2 on almost every measure , according to a shocking new report			1
the first comparative study between the two healthcare regimes reveals that patients in @entity1 are waiting far longer for vital tests and life - saving treatment than those in @entity2 , where the @entity0 is run by the @entity12 government			1
they are also likely to have to wait longer for an ambulance in an emergency and will be seen more slowly if they need to attend @entity16			1
astonishingly , the target for treating cancer cases referred by @entity19 in @entity1 has not been met since the middle of 2008			2
the study , produced by the respected @entity22 , is a devastating blow to @entity25 ’s claim that only @entity0 can be trusted to run the @entity0			2
the report is a devastating blow to @entity25 , pictured left , who claimed that only @entity0 can be trusted to run the @entity0			0
@entity29 , leader of the @entity30 , pictured right , said the report ' confirmed our worst fears ' it confirms the findings of a @entity37 investigation last year which sparked clashes in the @entity39 between @entity40 and mr @entity25			0
yet last night , @entity0 was still rejecting criticism of its handling of the @entity43 , saying it was ‘ misleading ’ for the @entity44 to make comparisons between the health services in @entity2 and @entity1			1
the report found that ambulance response times to life - threatening emergencies in @entity1 have worsened , despite a fall in the number of calls			1
and the number of patients waiting more than the four - hour target time for @entity16 treatment is double that in @entity2			1
the stark gap in performance between the @entity0 in @entity2 and @entity1 is likely to be a key election issue			1
@entity29 , leader of the @entity30 , said the report ‘ confirms our worst fears and lays bare the devastating consequences of @entity0 cuts to the @entity43 ’			0
he added : ‘ despite the best efforts of dedicated staff , @entity43 performance is significantly poorer than in @entity2 , where the health budget has been protected in recent years			2
‘ on almost every measure @entity30 patients receive an inferior service when compared to patients across the border , and having run the @entity43 since 1999 , @entity0 must take full responsibility for their appalling management of the health service			0
‘ @entity25 seeks to portray himself as the saviour of the @entity0 in @entity2			2
but in truth , the @entity30 experience of a @entity0 - run health service has shown that they simply can not be trusted anywhere near it			0
’ health campaigner @entity83 , of the @entity84 , described the report ’s findings as ‘ depressing , but not at all surprising ’			0
patients in @entity1 are likely to have to wait longer for an ambulance in an emergency and will be seen more slowly if they need to attend @entity16 ( file [ picture ) mr @entity83 , whose mother died following ‘ unacceptable treatment ’ at the @entity94 in @entity95 in 2012 , said @entity1 was becoming a ‘ second - class nation ’ in terms of healthcare			1
‘ the @entity99 is in abject denial about the scale of the crisis in the @entity0 in @entity1 , ’ he added			2
the @entity44 report raises real concerns about the level of service offered to patients in @entity1			2
@entity2 and @entity1 have different hospital waiting list targets , but the report notes that ‘ referral to treatment waiting times in @entity1 are typically longer than in @entity2 ’			1
in august , a third of patients receiving hospital treatment in @entity1 had waited more than 18 weeks , compared with just 6 per cent in @entity2			1
last year just 60 per cent of @entity116 999 calls received a response within eight minutes – below the 65 per cent target			0
in @entity2 , the figure was 74.8 per cent			2
the @entity0 - run government in @entity121 repeatedly dismissed the @entity37 ’s exposé of serious problems in the @entity43 as ‘ political smears ’			0
we began our campaign in october : october 20 , 2014 : the @entity37 published the first of a series of articles about the problems in the @entity43			0
the @entity99 claimed the allegations were ‘ spurious ’ and rejected calls – made by the @entity133 and politicians from across the spectrum – for an independent inquiry			0
welsh first minister @entity137 admitted he had not read the @entity37 ’s reports before dismissing our investigation out of hand and suggesting the issues raised had ‘ been dealt with already ’			0
he added : ‘ to suggest that the @entity0 in @entity1 is somehow in every way in a more difficult state than in @entity2 is quite simply wrong			1
’ the @entity99 released a 2,447 - word statement claiming there were ten inaccuracies in our coverage , but the @entity37 replied with a point - by - point refutation , quoting official statistics and statements			0
october 21 : after the @entity37 published its second round of stories , mr @entity137 told the @entity155 that ‘ the vast majority of people get the best care most of the time ’ in the @entity43			0
he accused the @entity37 and the @entity160 of turning @entity1 ’s health service into a ‘ political football ’			0
october 22 : the @entity37 published further articles exposing the scandal of @entity43 patients having to wait so long for operations that some were dying before they could be treated			0
the @entity99 issued another lengthy statement , this time 1,006 words long , which accused us of ‘ quoting selectively ’ from reports			0
october 24 : the @entity37 focused on how @entity30 cancer patients were being denied life - saving but expensive new treatments that are made available to sufferers in @entity2 through the government ’s @entity175			1
the @entity99 rejected calls for it to introduce a similar fund , quoting claims that the @entity0 in @entity2 was funding medication that had ‘ no impact on survival ’ and may not improve quality of life			2
the report also highlights funding cuts that belie mr @entity25 ’s claims that @entity0 will always support the @entity0			0
while health spending in @entity2 has been protected from cuts since the election , funding in @entity1 has fallen in real terms			1
spending on health in @entity1 fell from £ 6.3billion at the time of the election to £ 6billion in 2012/3 in real terms			0
a spokesman for the @entity99 said it was ‘ misleading ’ to make comparisons between the @entity0 in @entity2 and @entity1			1
he said : ‘ the report refers to a range of @entity0 performance data comparing @entity2 and @entity1 , even though numerous authoritative independent sources caution against such comparisons because of the differences in the way @entity0 performance is measured in @entity2 and in @entity1			1
the @entity99 dealt extensively with the misrepresentation of the @entity43 in the @entity37 recently			0
’ cancer treatment goals not met since mid- 2008 targets for treating cancer patients referred by their gps have not been met in @entity1 for more than six years , according to the report			1
the @entity43 says 95 per cent of patients diagnosed with cancer by their gp should start ‘ definitive treatment ’ within 62 days , but the @entity44 study says that ‘ was last met in mid- 2008 ’			2
last september , just 85 per cent of patients started the so - called ‘ urgent route ’ to treatment on time			2
ironically , those bypassing the ‘ urgent route ’ and going straight to hospital were likely to be treated far more quickly			0
the ‘ non-urgent route ’ target of treating 98 per cent of patients within 31 days is being met			0
the @entity43 says 95 per cent of patients diagnosed with cancer by their gp should start ‘ definitive treatment ’ within 62 days , but the @entity44 study says that ‘ was last met in mid- 2008 ’ ( file picture ) today ’s report also highlights other areas where patients in @entity1 wait much longer than those in @entity2 on average			1
in october , 93 per cent of patients waiting for hospital treatment in @entity2 had been on the waiting list for fewer than 18 weeks , compared with 72 per cent in @entity1			1
of those treated in august , 94 per cent in @entity2 had waited fewer than 18 weeks , compared with 66 per cent in @entity1			2
for ct scans , 100 per cent of patients in @entity2 are tested within six weeks , compared to just 82 per cent tested within eight weeks in @entity1			1
for non-obstetric ultrasound tests , 99 per cent of patients in @entity2 are tested within six weeks , compared with 70 per cent tested within eight weeks in @entity1			1
on @entity16 services , @entity2 and @entity1 have the same target that 95 per cent of patients should have to wait less than four hours			1
in 2013/14 , 13 per cent of patients attending @entity16 in @entity1 waited more than four hours – double the level in @entity2			1
in @entity244 and @entity245 , almost a fifth of patients waited more than four hours .			0
