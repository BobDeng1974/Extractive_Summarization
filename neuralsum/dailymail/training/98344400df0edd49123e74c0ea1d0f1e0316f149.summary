by @entity0 do you know a health hero ? the @entity7 , in partnership with @entity4 and @entity6 ’s @entity5 , is asking you to nominate special people in the health care sector who have made a real difference to your life or a loved one ’s			2
to nominate your health hero , click here			2
here , @entity15 tells one nominee ’s story			2
with her newborn son snuffling safely and healthily in her arms , @entity18 wept tears of joy and relief			1
reaching for her phone , there was one person she needed to call : the dear friend who had been by her side throughout the pregnancy			1
never mind that the next morning was @entity29 , she knew her delighted friend would drop everything to race to the hospital to see the new arrival			2
as predicted , she swept in , threw her arms around her friend , and wept unashamedly with the new family			2
the friend was @entity37 — who was @entity18 ’s obstetrician at @entity38 , @entity39			1
miss @entity37 knew more than anyone what this baby meant to @entity18 and her husband @entity44 , a lecturer at @entity45			1
dr @entity37 ( right ) has been nominated by @entity18 ( left ) after dr @entity46 helped her with her pregnancy and went the extra mile to support her ten months earlier , they had lost their daughter , @entity51 , after @entity18 miscarried at 23 weeks			1
a year before that , the couple ’s son , @entity52 , was stillborn at full term at another @entity39 hospital after @entity18 ’s placenta detached and starved her unborn child of oxygen			1
‘ the shock of losing @entity52 was like a physical blow , ’ says @entity18 quietly			1
‘ i hit such a low , and after @entity51 , the grief threatened to swallow me up again			2
losing her was so awful i could n’t even face telling my parents what had happened , because i felt so sorry for them			2
’ as @entity18 struggled to come to terms with the ‘ indescribable ’ pain of @entity51 ’s death , she discovered she was pregnant again			1
the news could n’t have come at a more distressing time , for two days later she had to return to @entity38 where @entity51 had been born to hear the results of the post-mortem on her daughter			2
‘ i tried to force myself to stay positive , but i was full of such emptiness and fear i could hardly dare imagine that this pregnancy would work			1
’ ‘ she handed me her mobile phone number and told me to ring her , day or night , promising , “ i ’m here for you every step of the way ”			1
’ @entity18 when she first met @entity81 , @entity18 , 36 , who lives in @entity82 , and runs a woman ’s mentoring network , was overwrought with a mixture grief and hormones			1
‘ but this lovely doctor was so comforting , calm and determined that i instantly felt more at ease			2
i had seen many different doctors before , but i never felt that anyone personally cared about me and my babies			2
at best , they had been kind but remote			2
‘ @entity81 had been asked to go through the results of the post-mortem with me			2
she was so kind and caring that i blurted out : “ i ’m pregnant again and i am hoping i will be looked after by you ”			2
i had this sudden , spontaneous feeling that she was the right doctor to help me become a mother			0
‘ she handed me her mobile phone number and told me to ring her , day or night , promising , “ i ’m here for you every step of the way ”			1
’ the post-mortem showed no reason for @entity18 ’s early labour , which only increased her anxiety			1
‘ but she said she would do her very best to make sure this pregnancy progressed well , and promised she would monitor me personally throughout			1
she was good to her word			0
any time i felt a twinge — often in the evenings , when she was at home — i would text or ring			0
without fail , she would ring straight back or text			0
‘ i contacted her countless times , and would always apologise for being silly			0
she would say : “ there ’s no such thing as a silly question			0
” ’ @entity18 says : ‘ it gave me confidence			1
by the last two months of pregnancy , i had a scan every two weeks to ensure the baby was growing as normal			1
a couple of times , the scans did n’t show the baby clearly enough , so @entity81 would stop what she was doing and scan me herself			0
‘ nothing was ever too much trouble			0
i had the feeling it was as important to her as it was to me that this baby would make it			0
’ the birth of a child is a moment mothers treasure for ever ( posed by models ) miss @entity37 arranged for @entity18 to have a temporary stitch placed in the cervix to prevent premature labour — this carries a small risk of miscarriage , which was clearly worrying for @entity18 and @entity44			1
‘ but miss @entity37 dealt with my endless questions and worries with a wonderful calmness			1
’ and it worked : baby @entity149 was delivered at 37 weeks on christmas eve 2007			1
‘ when he was born , there was silence and i froze , ’ recalls @entity18			1
‘ i thought “ oh no , not again ”			0
but then he gasped and cried and i just burst into tears			0
feeling him squirming and moving in my arms is a moment i will treasure forever			0
‘ i always dreamed of hearing a little voice call me “ @entity158 ” , and thanks to this wonderful doctor , that dream has come true			2
’ @entity162 ‘ i texted miss @entity37 , because i wanted her to know he was here and he was safe			1
she came in on her holiday just to see us			0
she hugged me and @entity44 and wept when she saw @entity149			1
’ but it ’s not just @entity81 ’s care and kindness that makes her so special , says another mother @entity170 , it ’s her willingness to go the extra mile for her patients and their babies			0
@entity170 , 36 , from @entity175 , in @entity39 was referred to @entity81 after she and her husband @entity176 , a window cleaner , spent five years trying to conceive			0
as she explains : ‘ i ’d spent eight months on hormone treatment being monitored by nurses who would n’t even look me in the face			0
‘ when i met @entity81 , i just burst into tears			0
she just looked at me and said , “ from this moment on , you are dealing with me personally			0
you will have a baby as soon as possible			0
” she gave me her mobile number , and she always answered any query — happily calling me back at weekends			0
‘ she tested my hormone and blood levels personally and frequently , and this extra attention to even the slightest change in my levels paid off			0
nine months later , i became pregnant with twins			0
’ medical workers like @entity81 help deliver hundred of new babies every day ( picture posed by models ) @entity170 had undergone @entity200 ( intrauterine insemination ) where the sperm is placed directly into the uterus during ovulation — and the timing is crucial			2
‘ when i went into labour in may 2011 , miss @entity37 came to see me at 8.30 in the morning , ’ says @entity170			1
‘ she returned at 8pm that evening , and i asked : “ when do you finish work ? ”			0
she ’d finished nearly four hours earlier , but said , “ i ’ve worked hard for these babies and i ’m going to deliver them myself — i ca n’t miss this			0
” ’ nearly two hours after that she delivered twins @entity213 and @entity214			0
‘ her total dedication goes far beyond anything i ’ve ever seen before with any other doctor , ’ says @entity170			0
for @entity18 and @entity44 , there ’s no doubt that @entity81 was key to them finally becoming a family			1
@entity149 is now six and @entity18 went on to have another little boy , @entity222 , now three			1
‘ we were so desperate to become parents , and meeting @entity81 was like having a friend who shared the same dream for us			0
’ @entity222 was born on march 31 , 2011 — ‘ and although @entity81 was working miles away at another hospital that day , she came back to see him the next day , ’ says @entity18			1
‘ i said : “ it ’s thanks to you i have these two boys			0
” ’ miss @entity37 sends me texts at @entity29 and on my birthday			1
when it was her birthday , i took the boys into the hospital to see her , and she cried with joy			0
‘ i always dreamed of hearing a little voice call me “ @entity158 ” , and thanks to this wonderful doctor , that dream has come true			2
’ for @entity18 and @entity170 , miss @entity37 is a more than worthy nominee for the @entity248 awards			1
but like so many of our nominees , miss @entity37 is modest about her efforts			1
asked about going to see @entity18 after @entity149 ’s birth , she says : ‘ i had looked after this wonderful lady all through her journey to becoming a mother , so how could i fail to turn up to share her happiness ? ‘ i had dreamed of the day she would hold her baby in her arms , and it did n’t matter that it was @entity29			1
i wanted to be there to hug @entity18 and @entity44 and to see that happiness in their eyes			1
‘ it is far more than a job to me — it is a passion			0
you are starting a new chapter of life with amazing women , and many of them you will never forget			0
‘ it ’s not about being a good doctor — it ’s about being a good person			0
