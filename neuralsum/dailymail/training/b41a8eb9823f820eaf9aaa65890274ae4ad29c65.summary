by @entity0 published : 00:57 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 09:06 est , 27 september 2013 a council has proposed a tough new housing scheme that will prioritise workers , former servicemen and charity volunteers over those who do n't make a contribution to society			1
under the controversial scheme set to be introduced by @entity10 on @entity11 , prospective tenants who work more than 12 hours a week will move to the top of the pile for social housing			1
@entity17 parents ' applications will also be fast - tracked as they too are seen as having made a contribution to the community			1
@entity21 chairman @entity20 , who runs @entity22 , said : ' it is important that we look after those who look after us			0
if someone puts themselves on the front line for their community then we ought to help them when they need our support			2
' prospective tenants in @entity10 who work more than 12 hours a week will move to the top of the pile for social housing under the scheme the council would ditch its three housing bands with five – urgent , high - need with community contribution , high - need , low - need with community contribution and low - need			1
the scheme is a response to overwhelming demand			1
around 6,500 people are seeking 19,000 council houses in @entity10 - on - @entity47 but just 1,600 are typically reallocated every year , reports the @entity48			1
councillor @entity49 , ­ cabinet member for housing , said : ' we are keen to ensure that those families who are working or volunteering get a chance to rent low - cost accommodation close to their work			2
' these are n’t just our views but reflect the views of the local ­ community and the plans have been drawn up by our tenants themselves			0
' help for heroes : military personnel will also get priority treatment under the plans the news comes as it emerged that the long - term unemployed are to be told they must do an unpaid full - time job or be stripped of their benefits			2
a dramatic extension of the conditions attached to unemployment handouts will be unveiled at the @entity76 next week , according to well - placed sources			0
ministers are convinced a new @entity86 - style ‘ work for the dole ’ scheme will help to reduce @entity80 ’s vast benefits bill and curb the something - for - nothing culture			0
it is expected that claimants who go through the government ’s main back - to - work scheme , the @entity91 , but fail to find a job , will be required to take part in unpaid community activities or work experience			0
those who refuse to do so face losing their welfare payments			0
work and pensions secretary @entity97 told the @entity98 : ‘ it ’s not acceptable for people to expect to live a life on benefits if they ’re able to work			0
