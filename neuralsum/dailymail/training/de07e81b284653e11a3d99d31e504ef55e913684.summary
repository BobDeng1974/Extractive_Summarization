' the contents belong initially to the original owner of the container , and then to the official receiver of wrecks , so anyone taking anything that washes ashore , even one packet of cigarettes , is effectively committing theft and will be prosecuted			1
' so the message to anyone intending to go down there looking for free fags is do n't bother			0
' warning : police have told potential looters to stay away hands off : police reminded locals that the cargo belongs to the shipping company first , and second to the official receive of wrecks the 1998 - built ship was reportedly heading from @entity75 to @entity76 when the containers toppled into the sea after it was caught in a fierce storm on february 14			1
the containers tipped out of the ship , which was pitching at 40 degrees in the storm , and spilled out into the sea - the biggest loss of cargo ever for the company			1

elsewhere in the county a large fossil was among debris washed up as a result of the recent storms			1
the football - sized fossil was discovered among items washed up on @entity107 near @entity108 , @entity109			0

it comes after a stash of unexploded bombs has been revealed along the @entity120 and in parts of @entity129			1
the storms that have ravaged and reshaped parts of the @entity133 coastline have led to the discovery of wartime shells long - buried on beaches			0
remnants : ammunition has been unearthed by the terrible weather that battered @entity141 's coasts there are also fears that flooding along the @entity143 will erode riverbanks , leading to the discovery of bombs dropped on the area by the @entity148 during the @entity149			1
police say that high tides and huge waves have either exposed devices or brought them closer to the surface			2
further storms and flooding are expected as a new front moves in from the @entity158			0

meanwhile a mortar was discovered on a beach at @entity215 , @entity216			0
