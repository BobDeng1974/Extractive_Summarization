by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 have announced that @entity3 is now their head coach on a permanent basis after almost two months in temporary charge			1
the 35 - year - old former @entity2 player and assistant coach became caretaker boss following the departure of @entity11 @entity10 on july 3 and has now signed a three - year contract			1
@entity2 won just two of their six matches under the temporary guidance of @entity16 but that included the scalp of leaders @entity20 and in their last match they held reigning champions @entity22 to a draw to keep alive their @entity25 play - off hopes			1
done deal : @entity2 have announced that @entity3 is now their head coach on a permanent basis @entity2 chief executive @entity29 said : ' it 's always been the plan to bring somebody through the ranks to one day take over as head coach and @entity3 has started very well in the role			1
' he is somebody who understands the club and the squad of players he will be working with , but more importantly he is a young @entity40 coach who is ready for this position and responsibility			0
' he 's learnt his trade and he 's very well respected within the game			0
the board had no hesitation in backing him with a three - year deal and i 'm sure the fans will now join us in giving him their full support for the rest of this season and beyond			1
' @entity3 , who is nine months older than the youngest @entity25 coach , @entity56 's @entity55 , joined @entity2 's backroom staff in 2008 after retiring as a player , working as assistant to both @entity10 and his predecessor @entity60			1
' i 'm absolutely delighted , ' @entity3 said			2
' it 's a dream come true for me and i 'm going to do my utmost to get this side back to where it belongs			0
' it 's a great honour and privilege to be the head coach of @entity2 and i want to put on record my thanks to the directors who have been fantastic with me over the past six weeks			2
' it 's been a testing period with some ups and downs but i 've really enjoyed the opportunity			0
i 've not been afraid to make the big decisions , i 've been honest with the players and they 've been honest with me in return , so hopefully that will continue			0
' the squad is coming together for next season - we 've signed some exciting outside backs and we 've hopefully got some more signings to be announced - but we 're still very much focused on our goals this year			1
' there 's six points up for grabs and we 've got to make sure we finish the season strongly and as high up that ladder as we possibly can			2
' moving forwards , i think we 're better than just fighting for that eighth spot			0
we 've struggled consistency wise this season and that 's something that as coaches and players we have to address			0
' @entity16 's first match in his confirmed role will be friday 's derby against @entity100 , one of his former clubs , at the @entity104 .			0
