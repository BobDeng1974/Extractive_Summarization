by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:24 am on 28th september 2011 @entity4 presenters @entity2 and @entity5 have driven into trouble yet again - this time for parking in disabled bays during filming of the hit show			1
in a feature on sunday night 's episode , the pair tried out electric cars by driving them to @entity16 , @entity17 , where they pulled into a car park to discuss the merits of the motors			1
but rather than parking in normal parking bays , they parked in spaces reserved for disabled people - causing a storm of protest from disabled motoring groups who said it was ' typical ' of @entity2			1
scandal : @entity4 presenters @entity2 and @entity5 have driven into trouble yet again for parking in disabled bays during filming of the hit show to add fuel to the fire , just after the slot about electric cars , @entity35 met a team of disabled soldiers who had been severely injured in @entity43			1
the soldiers - some who had lost three limbs - were shown laughing and joking with @entity35 as they took part in a cross-country racing in 4x4 cars as they prepare for the grueling @entity48			1
during the slot about electric cars , @entity2 - driving a £ 31,000 @entity50 - and @entity5 may - driving a £ 33,000 @entity51 - discussed the merits of non-petrol cars , asking ' should you buy an electric car ? ' after parking up in the disabled bays the pair laughed and joked about the costs of the cars and the electric motors - which are capable of a top speed of up to 90mph			1
typical : rather than parking in normal parking bays , @entity2 and @entity5 parked in spaces reserved for disabled people , sparking outrage among disability groups they also joked about the luggage space and how electric cars had to be fitted with special windscreen wipers which make barely any noise			1
but it was as they stepped out of their cars - with @entity2 and may even standing on top of a disabled road marking - that shocked viewers realised they had parked in disabled bays			1
is it ok for @entity4 stars to park in a disabled bay ' for a laugh ' ? @entity84 , of @entity85 , said he was sure that @entity2 ' would n't have cared ' about parking up in a disabled bay			2
he said : ' i 'm sure the last thing on @entity2 's mind was that he was parked in a disabled bay			2
' the abuse of non-disabled people parking in disabled bays is rife , and with people like @entity2 and @entity5 doing this other motorists will just think they can just park wherever they like			2
' people who are patently not disabled , like @entity2 and may , obviously did n't have a passing care that a disabled person might have needed those spaces			2
naughty : @entity4 's @entity2 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) are in trouble for parking in a disabled parking bay for a segment of the show ' i 'm sure @entity2 especially would not feel contrite about parking in a disabled bay - it shows a lack of feeling and care and a total lack of compassion			2
' @entity114 , of the @entity115 , said it was ' extremely frustrating ' watching non-disabled people park in disabled parking bays			2
he said : ' it 's an immense problem and is an extremely frustrating issue which is not helped by the likes of @entity2 and @entity5			2
' and viewer @entity122 , 32 , added : ' i was disgusted to see them parking up in a disabled bays			2
the pair of them were even standing about on the disability road markings and they did n't even notice it			2
' for them to be so casual about it is disgusting and they should be hauled over the coals - along with the entire production team - for doing something which in the end , will encourage viewers to think there is nothing wrong with parking in disabled bays			0
' the @entity142 has leapt to the defence of its popular presenters			0
controversial : it is just eight months since the team sparked a diplomatic incident by poking fun at @entity149 a spokesman said the show 's team did not ' condone parking in disabled bays ' and admitted it had cordoned off spaces reserved for disabled motorists , after striking an agreement with the owner of the land , for the segment			0
@entity161 is the executive producer of @entity4 said : ' firstly , we did have permission from the owner of the premises to park in the disabled bays , which gave us a quiet spot to film in , and there were three other disabled bays available which remained empty throughout			0
secondly , for those who are cross with us , please direct your anger towards myself and the production team , rather than at @entity2 and @entity5			0
@entity2 hit out at electric cars during the programme saying they " are not the future			1
" his comments have riled electric car maker @entity180 which has invested heavily in the electric motors and plans to create 800 jobs by building its @entity50 car in @entity184			1
@entity2 made the comments on sunday 's episode of @entity4 where he road tested the £ 31,000 @entity50 - and was filmed being pushed around in the car that had a flat battery			0
push ! @entity5 pushes @entity2 in the @entity50 after it runs out of power producers then showed him stranded in @entity192 where he spent the next few hours brass - rubbing whilst he waited for the battery to re-charge			0
however , @entity180 claims that viewers were not told that the battery had been more than half empty at the start of the trip - and only had enough power to go 35 miles			1
information from a @entity180 monitoring device which was in the @entity50 showed that when @entity2 set off on his 60 mile trip to @entity16 in @entity17 the battery was only 40 per cent charged			1
the firm says the car was delivered to @entity4 with a full battery and enough power to drive 100 miles			0
it said the device also showed that @entity2 did not switch on the ' eco-mode ' in the car which would have makes the car go further by slowing acceleration			0
@entity180 's executive vice president @entity214 told @entity215 the programme was " misleading			1
" the @entity142 said it " absolutely refuted " it had misled viewers over the charge and range			0
@entity4 says electric cars , like the @entity221 drove , are still too expensive and the charging infrastructure is still poor @entity4 executive producer @entity161 said : ' we never at any point in the film said that were testing the range claims of the vehicles , nor did we say that the vehicles would n't achieve their claimed range			1
' we also never said at any time that we were hoping to get to our destination on one charge			0
' we never said what the length of the journey was , where we had started from , or how long we had been driving for at the start of the film , so again , no inference about the range can be gleaned from our film			0
' mr @entity161 said the consumer points from the programme were clear , that electric cars are still very expensive , re-charging infrastructure is patchy , the range varies enormously			1
he said the @entity50 was " a very good car per se " but said the battery , in @entity4 's view " remains the achilles heel of the whole package			0
" a @entity180 spokesman said : ' the @entity50 battery pack is designed to last the lifetime of the car			1
if used in normal conditions , it is not expected that owners will ever have to replace the battery pack			0
' some degradation of the battery over time and use is normal , but the battery pack has been designed so that it offers a respectable range even after this degradation has taken place			0
' both presenters expressed deep concern to the film crew and i about using the disabled bays prior to filming , because of the disrespectful impression it would convey			0
they only capitulated when we assured them the parking had been approved by the owner , and that the disabled bay markings would not appear on television			0
this was our fault , not theirs , and we unreservedly apologise to all the viewers we have upset as a consequence			1
' the furore comes eight months after the pair , alongside @entity35 , were slammed for poking fun at @entity149			0
@entity35 said @entity149 cars reflected national characteristics , saying they were ‘ just going to be lazy , feckless , flatulent ’			1
@entity5 described @entity149 food as ‘ like sick with cheese on it ’ , while @entity2 predicted they would not get any complaints about the show because ‘ at the @entity149 embassy , the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this ( snores ) ’ .			0

they have also upset @entity180 saying electric cars like theirs " are not the future "
