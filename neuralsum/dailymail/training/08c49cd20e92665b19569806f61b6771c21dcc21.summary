by @entity0 a staggering 58 languages are spoken by children at just one junior school in a small @entity5 town			1
some 471 pupils aged from 3 - 11 speak almost five dozen different languages at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
an astonishing cocktail of 130 languages are spoken at schools in largely - rural @entity10 , a freedom of information request shows			1
@entity8 headteacher @entity15 said there was a ' misconception ' the children had no knowledge of @entity5 and lots of time and money spent on them @entity15 , headteacher of @entity8 , said : ' one of the challenges is the misconception that these children have no @entity5 and there is a great deal of time and money spent on these families and that simply is n’t the case			2
' the most common minority languages spoken at the mixed school are @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , with each representing between 3 - 4 per cent of the total			1
mr @entity15 defiantly insisted that students whose native tongue was not @entity5 are often not far behind their classmates			1
' our @entity5 - speaking children come with very poor communication skills anyway , when they first come in , ' he argued			2
' at that point at reception age , whether they have got @entity5 as an additional language or as a first language , the language development is a priority , the process is the same , and language acquisition is about the same rate			0
' however mr @entity15 did admit that it was not always easy communicating with immigrant parents			0
' there are parents we would need to write but we ca n’t because they do n’t have literacy skills , ' he said			0
languages spoken at @entity8 in @entity10 includes @entity36 and @entity34 he also denied that non-english speaking pupils diverted attention from @entity5 kids			1
' we track the progress of all of the children to make sure the resources are targeted at children who are n’t progressing at the right rate			0
' children who arrive without a good grasp of @entity5 do not sit in regular @entity5 classes but receive up to eight weeks of intensive instruction in ‘ @entity5 as an @entity74 ’ from a qualified teacher			0
for other classes youngsters are taught the vocabulary that they will need the week before it comes up in lessons			0
@entity81 also employs teachers who speak a range of languages , including @entity35 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			2
mr @entity15 said immigrant families are ' generally aspirational , they want their children to do well '			0
@entity90 , secretary of the @entity91 in @entity10 , admitted teachers often had ' difficulty ' communicating with pupils who did n’t speak @entity5			1
mr @entity90 said : ' in my own school we had some @entity35 children come and we had someone who came in as an interpreter for a while			2
' he also said pupils who did n’t speak @entity5 could receive too much attention from teachers			0
' that ’s always going to be a potential danger but teachers are going to make sure they devote attention to all the pupils , ' said mr @entity90			0
' but say you have got 30 pupils and 10 do n’t speak @entity5 obviously you are going to spend a disproportionate amount of time on those children because it takes longer to explain things to them			0
' @entity90 , secretary of the @entity91 in @entity10 , admitted teachers had difficulty communicating with some pupils and said a disproportionate amount of time could be spent helping them a @entity122 spokesman said : ' if children have been educated in another education system with different curriculum content , it will obviously take a bit of time to learn the new language and have the same level of subject knowledge for some curriculum areas as their @entity5 - speaking peers			1
' he added : ' a challenge for schools is often that of communicating with parents if the parents ’ @entity5 is limited			2
' altogether 6,325 pupils out of a total of 97,000 do not have @entity5 as a first language throughout @entity10			1
some 2,965 of those are in @entity9 , the most diverse borough in the @entity144 county			0
the figures show that lower year groups have higher numbers of pupils for whom @entity5 is not a first language			0
in year 1 there are 679 pupils who speak @entity5 as an additional language in @entity10 , that ’s compared to just five in @entity153			2
@entity154 , @entity155 , and @entity156 - a @entity158 tongue - are among kids ’ mother languages at primary and secondary schools across the county , while the most common languages other than @entity5 are @entity35 , @entity34 and @entity36			1
