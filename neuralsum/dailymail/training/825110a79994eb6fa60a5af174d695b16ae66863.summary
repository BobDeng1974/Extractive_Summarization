a mother - of - six has defended her decision to share her bed with her two children every night – and even claims it saved her marriage			1
@entity6 , 43 , from @entity7 , sleeps with her six - year - old and two - year - old daughters while her husband @entity9 is banished to the spare room			1
appearing on @entity12 ’s @entity11 , @entity6 revealed she ‘ cherishes ’ waking up with @entity13 , the youngest , and @entity14 – calling it a ‘ beautiful moment ’			1
our children are the most important things at this moment			0
‘ now , it 's the right thing for our family			0
' @entity6 also revealed she snuggles up with all of her children at bedtime , including @entity36 , 14 , honey , 12 , @entity38 , 11 , and @entity24 , nine , before the eldest go to their own rooms			1
discussing her reasoning for sharing her bed with her two youngest children , @entity6 , who runs @entity43 and is director of @entity45 , said : ' it started because i was made redundant and i was setting up a new business			1
' i already had four kids who were in their own beds and , with a baby , i needed to be able to sleep through the night so that i could attend breakfast networking meetings so i needed to have my sleep			1
@entity6 said sleeping in separate rooms made her marriage to @entity9 stronger @entity6 , pictured right with @entity57 , centre , and @entity14 , left , says it 's lovely waking up with her children ' just because i breastfed the baby , it was easier to have her in bed next to me , in between me and my husband @entity9			1
‘ and then the next one came along and rather than getting up in the night to tend to her , it was much easier to have her in the bed			2
’ @entity6 explained that when she welcomed her new baby , her five - year - old daughter , @entity14 , did n't want to get out of the bed			1
' i thought : " why should she ? "			0
’ explaining how her husband @entity9 felt about the situation , @entity6 said : ' if i do n't get my sleep , i 'm not the easiest person to live with			1
‘ it actually kept our marriage together , he went off to the spare room and we both got our sleep			2
' @entity6 added : ' it 's lovely waking up with your children and feeling them in the night and cuddling up to them			1
@entity19 questions how @entity6 will ever get her children into their own rooms if they 're constantly in a bed with her and tells her to teach them independence by giving them their own space on this morning ' my kids are extremely independent			1
they have boundaries but i am creating a nice safe and secure environment for them			0
' @entity6 ’s comments come after this morning research revealed 70 per cent of mothers have allowed their youngsters to sleep next to them			1
and a third admits they regularly let their child snooze alongside them and will continue to let them do so until they are well over the age of six			0
mother - of - one @entity19 also appeared on the show			1
however , she said she completely disagreed with @entity6 ’s views			2
‘ it 's a beautiful moment that does n't last forever so i think it 's nice to cherish that time			0
’ she continued : ‘ it 's only in the last 150 years that parents have put their children into their own rooms			0
‘ historically it 's very normal for parents to sleep with their children , and in other parts of the world it 's normal			2
mother - of - two @entity6 believes sharing her bed with her two children ( @entity14 , left , six , and @entity13 , two , right ) is so important she 's even forced her husband to sleep in the spare room she said : ' i have one child and initially i had her in the bed with me for a few weeks but we put her into the cot and it 's important that children develop routine and if you have them in the bed with you for a long period of time , they think that 's normal			1
' they flourish on boundaries , it 's very important with relationships with your children and your partner that you set those boundaries			0
' why ca n't then come in for a cuddle and then go in their own bed ? co-sleeping is n't appropriate			2
’ she added : ‘ we will see more and more families divorcing because mothers are choosing their children over their relationship			2
' @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 at @entity151 ( www.tinies.com ) said : ' we all know the risk of co sleeping , the risk of smothering etc. but what about the long term effect on your child ? how they miss out on independence , and be taught their coping mechanisms			0
' the benefits i do believe initially are fabulous , for breast feeding and bonding with your baby			0
and although it is not recommended i do feel at the age of a few weeks they should definitely be put in a moses basket / cot			0
this encourages independence for the baby and teaches them to self sooth and that it is ok to be put down and sleep without being so close to a parent			2
' another benefit is to be able to sleep with limited interruptions			0
i 'm also a great believer that the behaviour patterns you install from a very early age with your baby will help them grow and develop into independent and less anxious individuals that will have the coping mechanisms to embrace life and all its challenges with strength and gusto			0
all because they have been taught to be strong , trust their ability and be as independent as they can with their thinking			0
