bosses have offered workers personal guards to take them to their cars and tram stops but overall crime and violent crime at @entity27 are both lower than surrounding @entity28 in @entity30 's @entity29 , @entity19 figures show			1

it ’s definitely safer than @entity91			1

joke : @entity38 , centre , with her gold medal following at the @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity107 , but a @entity11 presenter suggested she should n't have left it in her car in @entity5 @entity113 presenter @entity112 blasted the @entity11 ’s move last year , describing @entity5 as ‘ a small suburb with a @entity116 and a canal with ducks on it ’ and said that he would resign if the motoring programme was moved north			1

’ explaining her comments on thursday a spokesman for @entity172 said : ' during a light - hearted moment at the end of the interview with @entity38 , an off - the - cuff remark was made			0
no offence was intended and we ’re sorry if anyone was upset			0

corporation chiefs have offered personal security guards to escort men and women to their cars and tram stops from the studios			1
and an extraordinary email intended to reassure staff about on - site security will serve only to increase fears , with a @entity11 executive admitting she has been looking at site security ‘ following a couple of incidents ’			1
