@entity20 claims the new rules would be used to target ruthless tax dodgers			1
plans to give the taxman the power to raid individuals ' bank accounts without their permission are potentially illegal according to experts			2
the ' unprecedented access ' - revealed in the @entity11 statement - could result in money being taken from innocent families , mps have been warned but @entity35 , head of the tax faculty at the @entity37 , told @entity34 it is ‘ a fundamental tenet of our @entity41 law and our democratic society ’ that money ‘ can not be grabbed from somebody ’s account without a judge agreeing to the move ’			1
he said the change , which could come into force in just 12 months ’ time , would be ‘ unprecedented in the @entity51 ’			2
he added : ‘ at the end of the day , we ca n’t have @entity20 as judge and jury on this			2
’ mr @entity35 said the tax authority had a long track record of making mistakes and harassing innocent taxpayers – and that it could end up targeting the wrong people			2
in his written evidence to mps , mr @entity35 said the current proposal is ‘ of considerable concern to many taxpayers and accountants ’			0
‘ these powers are extremely worrying and excessive , ’ he added			0
@entity68 , tax policy director at the @entity70 , said he feared vulnerable people could be wrongly charged			2
he told @entity34 : ‘ the concern that we certainly have is that however many safeguards there are on the ability to simply take money from somebody ’s bank account , it does rely on the authority having worked out how much money should correctly be taken from it in the first place			0
‘ it may mean over a period of time particularly more vulnerable people – people who are not wealthy , high earners – may become subject to this			0
’ the experts ’ comments have added to a growing chorus of concern over the controversial move			0
@entity51 is being robbed of around £ 35billion a year by cheats who fail to pay their taxes and others who find ways of avoiding them , according to @entity20			1
the powers were outlined as part of measures to clamp down on tax avoidance and would allow @entity20 ( pictured ) to seize unlimited amounts of money directly from the bank accounts of anyone they believes owes more than £ 1,000 in tax under the proposals , which will be subject to a consultation , @entity20 will be able to take all the money that a person owes in tax out of their bank account , subject to two key rules			1
it can not take the full amount unless the person would have at least £ 5,000 left across all bank accounts after the tax debt has been paid and the money can only be taken if @entity20 has contacted the person at least three times about the unpaid tax bill			1
@entity20 estimates around 17,000 people a year will be hit by the new rules and each of them will typically owe around £ 5,800			1
but @entity131 mp , who chairs the @entity132 , has previously said members of the committee were ‘ concerned ’ about the move			0
@entity136 mp @entity136 , who sits on the committee , has said : ‘ the victims will be people with just enough money to go after but not enough to hire lawyers to fend it off			0
’ he said any such ‘ advance of powers by the state ’ should be ‘ resisted unless they can justify it ’			0
mr @entity68 has previously said : ‘ there are lots of very unsophisticated people out there with more than £ 5,000 in a bank account			0
we are truly worried about the vulnerable			0
’ mr @entity35 said the new law could trigger ‘ perverse effects ’ , such as people keeping their money in cash , rather than in a bank account , so @entity20 can not get its hands on the money			2
in the @entity11 documents , the @entity161 insists @entity20 ’s new debt collection powers ‘ bring the @entity51 in line with many other tax authorities which already have the power to recover debts directly from an individual ’s account , such as @entity169 and @entity170 ’			1
an @entity20 spokesman said : ‘ most people pay their taxes on time , but a minority do not , and some refuse to engage with us at all			2
‘ it is wrong that this should hand an advantage to those who simply dodge their obligations and is unfair on the vast majority who pay their taxes in full and on time			0
‘ we will shortly be consulting on a new measure with appropriate safeguards to help level the playing field , and tackle those who have the means to pay but are choosing not to			0
‘ this will only affect a tiny number of debtors			0
’ overall , @entity20 estimates around half of the people who it will be targeting have more than £ 20,000 in their bank accounts , but are still refusing to pay their tax bill .			1
