analysis of more than 1.5million books has revealed the use of the word ‘ get ’ has gone up while ‘ give ’ has fallen out of favour			1
modern books also favour feelings over religion and choice over obedience			2
analysis of more than 1.5million books has revealed the use of the word ¿ get ¿ has gone up while ¿ give ¿ has gone down the changes , revealed in a study of @entity20 and @entity21 books published between 1800 and 2000 , including popular and academic works			1
the @entity24 researchers say the changes in the printed work reflect the change in values that comes with urbanisation , with caring , sharing rural communities being increasingly replaced by materialistic , go - getting town and city - dwellers			1
psychologist @entity33 used a computer programme provided by @entity35 to assess the frequency key words appeared in almost 1.2million @entity21 books			1
key words included ‘ obliged ’ , picked because of the importance of duty in small family - orientated communities , and ‘ choose ’ , a word which denotes the freedom of choice important to modern generations			0
the use of ‘ obliged ’ fell at least six-fold over the 200 year studied , while ‘ choose ’ became increasingly common			0
by the 1930s , authors spoke more of choice than they did of obligation			0
frequency of use of the words ‘ act ’ and ‘ feel ’ was also compared			0
other recent research found that modern - day @entity20 novels lack emotion by the 1970s , books spoke more of feelings than of actions			1
the analysis , published in the journal @entity62 also showed a move from giving to getting			2
use of the word ‘ get ’ quadrupled from 1800 to 2000 , reflecting , it is though a move towards a more materialistic society			1
however , there was a blip in its rise between 1940 and 1960			0
researchers say this could be a reflection of a greater community spirit during the @entity75 and the civil rights movement			2
the study also revealed the words ‘ obedience ’ , ‘ authority ’ , ‘ belong ’ and ‘ pray ’ to be in decline			0
the task was repeated using an online library of 350,000 @entity20 books which produced similar results			1
professor @entity86 said : ‘ these replications indicate that the underlying concepts , not just word frequencies , have been changing in historical importance over time			0
‘ developing countries have become wealthier , more urbanised , more technologically advanced and more highly educated			0
‘ but the process also applies to countries such as the @entity21 and @entity20			1
‘ the trend is particularly noticeable if one views the situation over a timescale of centuries , as in the present study			0
’ other recent research found that modern - day @entity20 novels lack emotion – perhaps because we have started to feel it is a weakness to show our feelings .			2
