the exodus of @entity2 and @entity3 players will accelerate this week with more than 30 expected to depart @entity5 clubs for major international tournaments			1
the @entity7 in @entity8 begins on january 9 and the @entity9 starts in @entity10 eight days later , with both competitions providing a route to the @entity13 in @entity14 in the summer of 2017			1
@entity15 are still involved in negotiations about precisely when @entity17 must be released			1
@entity17 will be a huge miss for @entity15 when he is released for international duty next month @entity20 forward @entity21 ( circled ) was lucky to stay on the pitch after elbowing @entity23 @entity24 claimed on sunday that it was yet to be decided if the midfielder could play against @entity27 in the @entity28 on sunday			1
most @entity2 players are expected to leave before the weekend but clubs will be busily involved in similar talks			1
@entity20 would have liked to keep @entity21 , @entity32 and @entity33 until after the tricky @entity28 third - round tie at @entity35 , for whom @entity36 would prefer to have wide midfielders @entity39 and @entity40 available			1
it was among the reasons why the two @entity43 teams agreed to play on saturday when 16 top - flight clubs moved their third - round ties to offer players more recovery time after the fixtures on thursday			1
@entity35 ’s flexibility was limited by the fact @entity51 rugby team are at home to @entity53 on sunday and police would not agree to both games on the same day			2
the question of @entity21 ’s availability will become irrelevant as he faces a violent conduct charge for throwing an elbow at @entity23 which is likely to result in a ban			1
@entity62 will be missing top scorer @entity63 throughout january due to the @entity9 as well as his brother @entity17 , @entity64 is also set to represent @entity65 at the @entity9 all clubs are subject to @entity68 ’s 14 - day rule but some nations can be more accommodating than others with their big - name stars			1
there is no longer much bleating by club managers about losing players to a tournament which is clearly fixed in the international calendar , although the @entity9 has been moved from @entity78 , who pulled out after this year ’s ebola crisis			1
@entity62 will be among those who feel the pinch			2
@entity83 will lose top scorer @entity63 and midfielder @entity84 after the game at home to @entity87 on thursday			2
they will not be available for the @entity28 tie at @entity90 next tuesday , but @entity83 has been boosted by @entity92 ’s decision to omit @entity93 from the squad			2
@entity62 ’s @entity95 has retired from international football so is not in the provisional @entity98 squad named by manager @entity99			0
@entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 are also in international retirement			0
@entity104 - in action for @entity106 against @entity35 on @entity107 - will join up with the @entity109 squad @entity110 put in a sterling performance for @entity112 as they secured a hard - earned point at @entity115 palace winger @entity116 wo n't be joining up with the @entity118 squad until his wife has given birth @entity121 ( @entity122 ) , @entity123 ( @entity124 ) and @entity125 ( @entity126 ) are also not involved because their countries did not qualify			1
@entity130 ’s @entity129 has been ruled out by a knee injury			0
@entity106 , who play at @entity133 in the @entity28 on monday , will release @entity104 after facing @entity134 on @entity135 and @entity136 , who play @entity138 on saturday , will release @entity139 after their game against @entity115 on thursday			0
@entity141 will also be available for @entity142 against @entity115 before he joins the @entity144 squad in @entity8 for the @entity7			1
@entity146 ’s @entity145 is also in the @entity144 squad			0
@entity8 refused @entity112 ’s request to keep captain @entity110 until after their @entity149 game on @entity135			2
‘ they ’re not necessarily pleased but they accept it , ’ said @entity110			2
at least @entity112 wo n’t lose winger @entity116 - who has said he wo n’t join up with @entity118 until after his wife has given birth			0
