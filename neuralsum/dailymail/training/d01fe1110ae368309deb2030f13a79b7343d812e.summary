the family of a mother - of - two who died from skin cancer have spoken of their anger that the disease was n't spotted by doctors earlier			1
@entity7 , 33 , had gone to her doctors a year before she was diagnosed with malignant melanoma about a mole above her eyebrow			1
but miss @entity7 was reassured that the mole ' looked fine ' and advised to return if it bled or became itchy			1
she went away and it was only when the mole was spotted by another gp she went to see about a stye on her eye that she was sent for tests			2
@entity7 ( pictured with her twin sons , @entity21 and @entity22 ) died of skin cancer at the age of 33 , less than a year after finding a suspicious mole on her face doctors removed the mole and she was expected to make a full recovery - but tests then revealed she was ravaged with cancer which had spread to several of her major organs			1
she passed away on october 28 in a hospice and her funeral was held today			0
friends said miss @entity7 was a ' very regular ' sunbed user who topped up her tan as often as she could , sometimes a few times a week			1
after having the mole removed , miss @entity7 , an online retailer , assumed she was on the road to recovery			1
but a few weeks later she began to feel ill - and tests revealed the cancer had spread to organs such as her lungs and liver			2
her father , @entity47 , 62 , and mother , @entity49 , 58 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , now want to warn others of the risk they believe is posed by the sunbeds their daughter regularly used			0
mr @entity56 said : ‘ experts at @entity59 ’s @entity58 have told us they think sunbed use was the prime reason for @entity7 ’s death			1
' @entity65 use has robbed us of our stunning only daughter			0
she hardly ever went abroad			0
' if this story just saves one life , then it ’s worth it and @entity7 will not have died in vain			1
' ms @entity7 was initially expected to make a full recovery after having surgery to remove the mole on her face			1
however , the cancer spread to her jaw and major organs ms @entity7 's parents , @entity47 and @entity49 , believe their daughter developed the cancer as a result of her sunbed use - they are now encouraging other people not to use sunbeds ‘ she was such a lovely person , so loving - especially to her twin sons @entity21 and @entity22 , aged eight - and she had so many friends			1
she was so well known all over this region			0
’ her mother added : ‘ the two boys were her life			0
even though she was so desperately ill at the end , nothing would stop her attending their birthday party on october 20 , just eight days before she died			0
’ she added : ‘ @entity97 is irreplaceable and , though our hearts are broken , we are so very proud of her and the way in which she lived her life			0
’ research has shown that people who have ever used a sunbed are 20 per cent more likely to develop melanoma later in life , compared to people who had never used one			2
and those who started using sunbeds before the age of 35 were 87 per cent more likely to develop melanoma compared to people who have never used a sunbed			2
cases of malignant melanoma - the deadliest skin cancer - have doubled in the last decade , according to figures from @entity118			1
mr @entity56 said : ' if this story just saves one life , then it 's worth it and @entity7 will not have died in vain			2
' ms @entity7 ( pictured as a child ) was a keen horse rider who won many awards as a child and teenager around 13,000 @entity128 are diagnosed with the illness each year and it causes 2,800 deaths			1
miss @entity7 's parents said that doctors in the @entity134 have just announced a wonder drug combination which means 50 per cent of advanced skin cancer sufferers can now be saved , but it came too late for their daughter			1
this involves using a drug called @entity140 and another called @entity141 , which fight and suppress the cancer simultaneously , in a revolutionary new way			0
mr @entity56 said : ‘ just a month before she died , @entity7 wept as she watched a @entity145 report which stated this was now a fact			1
‘ i had also searched the internet for the very latest news on treatment			0
but the lifeline came just too late for her as she was n’t able to benefit from the new drug combination			0
' if this story saves just one life , then it 's worth it and @entity7 will not ahve died in vain			2
' @entity65 use robbed us of our stunning only daughter			0
' she hardly ever went abroad			0
however , the couple want people in their area to know that lives could now be saved as the ground - breaking treatment is being trialled at five @entity128 hospitals			0
