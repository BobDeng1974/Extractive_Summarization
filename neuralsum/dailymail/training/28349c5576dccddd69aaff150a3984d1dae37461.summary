former @entity18 striker @entity0 has dismissed claims he killed a friend in a black magic ritual @entity8 and @entity12 were last seen heading towards the ocean together on a jet ski and were presumed drowned			1
but allegations in the media began to suggest the disappearance was suspicious			1
rumours circulated that @entity0 had either murdered @entity8 or had him kidnapped - and even suggested he sacrificed him spiritually to enhance his own career			1
no bodies were recovered and rumours continued this month when @entity0 's brother and fellow @entity1 footballer , @entity32 , was alleged to have been part of a gang which attacked a journalist who had asked the player about the rumours			1

in a statement , his lawyer @entity50 read : ' in our painful silence , we have been totally dismayed by the fact that the platform was provided for the peddling of these wild and ludicrous allegations and rumours against us			1
' those to whom the platform was provided offered no evidence whatsoever to back their statements			0
and indeed , the allegation of spiritual sacrifice can by no stretch of the imagination be propped up			2
' the startling development has been the outbursts of persons who should know better			2
' indeed , one such person has gone has far as to claim that he knows where @entity8 is being kept and that @entity0 also knows where @entity8 is being kept			1
he also made the unfortunate statement that we have bribed @entity8 's family to keep silent over the matter			2
@entity8 's father has publicly denied this			2
this is no way to treat grieving families and friends			0
' the speculation prompted the former @entity3 striker to hold a press conference @entity0 joined @entity45 side @entity43 from @entity18 in 2011 and is paid more than £ 6million a season he went on to say : ' admittedly , the net effect of the peddling of these wild allegations and rumours is that the word on the street is that we had a hand in the disappearance of @entity8 and @entity12			1
' this is how a person 's reputation gets ruined and this is how disaffection gets sowed in the minds of persons against the person who is being attacked so unfairly			0
' perhaps we should have come out earlier			0
but i have already explained why we could not			0
' now , we take the opportunity and state without the slightest doubt in our minds that we are not blamable for the disappearance of @entity8 and @entity12			1
' we had no hand in that occurrence			0
we have no moral or legal culpability whatsoever			0
' we do not know @entity12 that well			2

we have no ill will against her			0
' we know @entity8 all too well			2
we loved him as one of our own			0
