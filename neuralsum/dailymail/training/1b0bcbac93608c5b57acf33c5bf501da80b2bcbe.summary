i hope @entity2 enjoys his time in @entity4 , he ’s the best player @entity5 has had for many years , and the most misunderstood footballer this country has ever produced			1
we should be proud of this guy , but instead too many judge him on peripheral nonsense rather than his talent and success			2
judge him on his football , not his marriage , a training - ground prank gone wrong , or a broken promise at @entity18			1
let ’s start with the story that turned @entity18 fans , and many others , against him : @entity2 swerving his car when he found out he was being offered £ 55k a week			1
if you took a dislike to him because of this , turn the situation on yourself			2
happy man : @entity2 takes a selfie with the @entity31 shirt after being presented to the media @entity4 job : @entity2 has landed in @entity34 ahead of his move to serie a side @entity31 new start : the former @entity5 defender was a free agent after leaving @entity39 imagine you ’re earning £ 25k a year			1
all your colleagues doing the same job are on at least three times more , some picking up quadruple your wage			2
you ’re on such a relatively low wage because this is your first job			0
you ask for an increase , you ’re told you ’ll get a rise of £ 10k a year			0
you do n’t settle for that			0
so you ask for more , to bring you closer , but still behind , some of your colleagues			0
you ’re promised the new salary you ask for - £ 60k a year			0
you accept , despite colleagues saying you ’re worth far more , and despite other companies offering more			0
but when the offer is put on paper , it ’s actually £ 55k a year			0
how would you feel ? replace the word ‘ year ’ with ‘ week ’ and you have @entity2 ’s reasons for being angry with @entity18			1
breaking through : @entity2 made his @entity18 debut in the late 1990s and played more than 150 times for the club dream come true : @entity2 was pictured with the @entity66 trophy as a youngster and then played for @entity18 part of the team : @entity2 played alongside the likes of @entity71 and @entity72 it was n’t the amount of money that made him nearly crash his car , it was what he perceived as a broken promise from employers he trusted			1
you would all feel annoyed if your employer broke a promise to you , so it ’s hypocritical to judge @entity2 on this			1
he ’s been judged on the break - up of his marriage to @entity87			0
maybe he did wrong , and it would n’t surprise me if he had regrets but in the heat of a relationship , who knows what is said and done behind closed doors ? do you have all the details of their break - up ? do you know the whole truth ? in the middle of a failing relationship people can say and do some awful things that they quickly regret			0
you ’re very lucky if you ’ve not been in that place			0
in the public eye : @entity2 's marriage to @entity107 singer @entity87 was popular with newspapers failed romance : @entity2 and @entity87 started dating in 2004 and were married in 2006 but divorced in 2010 @entity2 shot a work experience kid at the training - ground			1
who can defend that ? he was an idiot			0
but he is n’t a gangster			0
people over-reacted to a bit of stupidity			0
here ’s what @entity2 should be judged on : he has won literally everything in the game at a club level			1
he was an @entity5 international at 21 , and won more than 100 caps			1
he was brilliant for his country , one of the very few of his generation who can hold his head up high and say he was excellent at international level			2
starting out : @entity2 made his @entity5 debut back in 2001 , against @entity131 in a @entity133 qualifier class apart : @entity2 is the best player @entity5 have produced since @entity134 landmark : @entity2 made it to 100 caps , captained the team and eventually ended his career on 107 and who was n’t impressed with @entity2 when after captaining @entity5 last summer , he described it as a ‘ dream come true			1
’ he went on to say : ‘ i ’ve lived a little boy ’s dream today			0
’ that ’s the kind of commitment and emotion i want to see from players			2
@entity2 ’s got the quality and ability to back it up			1
unfortunately too many fans preferred to overlook the footballing talents of @entity2 , instead they chose to misinterpret and blow out of proportion stories away from the pitch			2
lesser characters would have been ruined by such criticism			0
@entity2 continued to be brilliant			2
strength of character , passion for playing , quality and consistency are all his hallmarks			0
blue day : @entity164 signed @entity2 for @entity39 in 2006 the trophy years : @entity2 won nine trophies in his time at @entity39 , including the @entity168 time to say goodbye : @entity2 applauds the @entity39 fans after his final game away at @entity172 but he also had the ability to compete with and be better than the very best the world could throw at him – look at the battles he won against @entity176			1
how many @entity5 players in the past can genuinely make that boast ? he may not be a goalscorer or a fantasy - player , he may not be in an eye - catching , headline - making position on the field , but for consistency , quality , and being as good for his country as he was for his club , @entity2 is the best @entity5 have produced since @entity134			1
do you remember him having a bad game for his country ? me neither			2
@entity18 can feel proud they produced him , @entity39 can feel proud they continued that development and success , and @entity195 football should be proud of @entity2 .			1

@entity18 broke promises over new deal for @entity2 in 2006
@entity2 has represented @entity5 107 times and never let his country down
@entity2 should be remembered as one of the best @entity5 players since @entity134
