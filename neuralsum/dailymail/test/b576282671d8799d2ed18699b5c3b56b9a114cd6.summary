@entity0 their mother by refusing to fund a life - saving drug a terminally - ill cancer sufferer has accused the @entity2 of denying her two daughters their mother by refusing to fund a potentially life - extending drug			1
@entity0 , 31 , suffers from a rare form of stomach cancer and is currently taking three drugs to try to prolong her life			1
the third and most effective drug - regorafenib - costs the @entity2 around £ 1,000 a week to provide and has been removed from the health service 's approved list of treatments			1
mrs @entity0 , who lives with her husband @entity18 and daughters @entity20 , six , and @entity21 , four , in @entity22 , @entity23 , has wild - type gastrointestinal cancer , which causes tumours to grow in the stomach and intestines			1
the mother - of - two , who is yet to tell her young children about her condition , says she can not afford to buy regorafenib privately and has called on @entity31 to reverse their decision			1
she said : ' the final drug is the most effective and it is heart breaking they have removed it from the treatment list			2
' the cancer that i have is extremely rare and the research into it is limited so it angers me that they are removing a drug that has been proven to work			2
' i am lucky that i have managed to spend 14 months on the first drug , @entity45 , in the series but i know that it will soon have no effect on my body			0
' the second drug , @entity51 , is not very effective and i know that when i have to be put on it i will have minimal time left			0
' you can buy regorafenib privately but that costs £ 3,700 a month and i do n't have that kind of money			2
' family members have offered to sell their houses and belongings to pay for my treatment but i ca n't accept that			0
' i can not ask my family to put their lives on hold when i might only get another year of life			0
' mrs @entity0 ( pictured with daughters @entity20 , left , and @entity21 , right ) , who has a rare form of stomach cancer , has been refused a drug which could help her battle the disease the mother - of - two , who set up a 100,000 - strong petition for the drug regorafenib to be funded , has not told her daughters that she has cancer mrs @entity77 , who lives in @entity22 , @entity23 , with her daughters and husband @entity18 , has wild - type gastrointestinal cancer , which causes tumours to grow in the stomach and intestines after @entity31 removed the drug from their list of treatments in january this year , mrs @entity0 launched a petition calling on the @entity2 to reinstate it			1
more than 100,000 people have signed it , meaning @entity89 will have to discuss the issue in @entity91 when they return to the @entity92 after the election - but by then mrs @entity0 's cancer may have progressed			1
despite thousands joining her cause , mrs @entity0 is yet to tell her daughters that she has cancer			1
' i do not want to scare them with what i am going through , ' she said			0
' we had to watch my dad die of lung cancer just 18 months ago and the girls found that really tough as they were very close to him			0
' if i told them i had cancer it would scare them and no parent wants to scare their child			0
i do spoil them more then what other parents would but who can blame me			0
' i want them to have as many happy memories with us as a family as possible before i get too ill and i can no longer enjoy the time i have			0
' i think about the conversation i will have to have with them in the future and it heart wrenching that i will have to tell my daughters i will soon not be here anymore			0
' but i know that i have to push that conversation to the back of mind and enjoy the time i have left with my family			0
' the @entity2 currently spends in the region of £ 1.3billion on cancer drugs a year , and receives a further £ 200million annual boost from the @entity132 - which helps to fund treatments for rare forms of the disease			1
@entity31 then decides what drugs this money goes towards , with a ruling in january removing regorafenib from the fund 's list because the treatment 's effectiveness did not represent ' sufficient value for retention '			2
the report found that , on average , it cost £ 4,493 to provide a four - week cycle of regorafenib to a patient , with the average recipient needing the drug for 23 weeks			1
@entity31 declined to comment .			2
