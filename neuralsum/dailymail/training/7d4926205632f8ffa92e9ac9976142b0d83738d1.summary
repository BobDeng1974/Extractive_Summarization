by @entity0 published : 15:42 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 15:46 est , 12 february 2013 time waster : @entity2 leaving @entity3 after pleaded guilty to jumping a red light a barrister has been ordered to pay £ 5,000 in legal costs for ' wasting time ' after he refused to pay a £ 60 fine for jumping a red light			1
@entity2 was caught racing through a central @entity11 junction at 65mph in his 3.2litre c - class @entity12 a full 1.4 seconds after the light had turned red in november 2011			1
but instead of owning up and paying the fine he tried to have the charge thrown out and fought a year - long battle in the courts which cost a total of £ 4,769			1
within 14 months the case was listed seven times and there were four court hearings			0
the 58 - year - old claimed he was never given the option of paying an on - the - spot fine and that his speed should not have been taken into consideration when prosecuting him			1
at one stage he even claimed the device used to catch him was not @entity29 approved and complained he did not have the right to a fair trial citing @entity32 6 of the @entity33			0
but today he finally pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to comply with a traffic signal after a judge ruled there was no abuse of process by the prosecution and ‘ a fair trial could undoubtedly take place			1
’ district judge @entity43 told @entity44 that a ' substantial amount ' of court time and resources had been wasted			0
five files of documents were handed over as part of @entity53 's defence in what should have been a ‘ seemingly straightforward prosecution , ' the court heard			0
judge @entity43 said : ' for reasons i well understand , but i fear mr @entity53 does not , the lengthy and extensive paperwork overwhelmed the @entity11 traffic prosecution team and indeed the @entity60 , which is simply under - resourced to deal with such paperwork			2
' prosecutor @entity62 said he had added up the cost of proceedings which came to £ 4,769			2
he added : ' mr @entity53 has wasted the court ’s time from the moment this case started			0
' guilty : @entity2 spent a year fighting the case against paying the £ 60 fine for jumping a red light @entity53 was told if he pleaded guilty today he would be sentenced only on the issue of crossing the red light			1
the judge sentenced him to three points on his licence , a £ 60 fine plus a £ 15 victim surcharge			2
he added : ' i am also ordering you to pay the full costs of the proceedings as this prosecution has been a fallacy from the start and the cost to the public purse should be reimbursed			0
' @entity53 , who qualified as a barrister in 1975 and was appointed @entity88 in 1993 , asked for seven days to pay it			0
the @entity88 , whose address was given in court as his chambers , @entity93 , at @entity94 , @entity95 , north @entity11 , declined to comment as he left court .			2
