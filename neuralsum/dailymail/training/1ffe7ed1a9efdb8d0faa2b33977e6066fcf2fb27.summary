when @entity2 the cat was brought into the @entity3 last week he became the fattest cat to have waddled through their doors for decades			1
' he is the biggest cat i 've ever seen and i 've been a vet for 45 years , ' said @entity8 , @entity3 veterinarian who works at the @entity3 in @entity9 where @entity2 was brought in			1
tipping the scales at 14.3kg , the nine - year - old ordinary domestic short hair weighs almost three times what he should			1
the nine - year - old cat is being cared for by @entity16 and her daughter @entity17 ( pictured ) for a month			2
@entity16 is a vet nurse form the @entity3 and has put him on a special diet @entity2 , held here by @entity16 , is at risk of diabetes , as well as heart , liver and kidney disease and arthritis to tell if your cat has packed on a few too many pounds , @entity8 says you should feel the skin over their ribs			1
' if it 's difficult to feel their ribs , that usually means the cat is overweight , ' she said			0
owners should also weigh their cats - either at the vets or by holding their cats and subtracting their own weight from the total - to see if weight loss is working			2
to make sure you 're not overfeeding your cat , check the back of the pet food packet and compare the recommended serve with how much your cat eats			0
' if you 're feeding it too much , you should feed it what the packet says			0
if that does n't work , you should decrease the amount the cat 's being fed by 25 percent , ' recommends ms @entity8			0
if owners do n't see a change after a month , ms @entity8 recommends taking the cat to the vet , where the vet can check for hormonal problems or recommend a special diet			1
' for a cat like him , 5 to 6 kg would probably be a reasonable weight , ' said ms @entity8			1
@entity2 came to the @entity3 because his owners were moving house and could not take him with them			2
when he was brought to the @entity3 centre staff decided to name him and settled , for obvious reasons , on @entity2			1
as with humans , ms @entity8 said , pets get overweight from a combination of overfeeding and lack of exercise			0
' @entity74 can be very persistent , there are cats that will follow you to the fridge and more or less demand food			0
there are owners who have trouble saying no , i guess it 's like parents saying no to the kids , ' said ms @entity8			0
' overweight cats are pretty much subject to the same problems we have when we 're overweight , ' said ms @entity8			0
some of the dangers to @entity2 's health posed by his size include heart and kidney disease , diabetes , muscle atrophy , and arthritis			0
sumo is currently being fostered by one of the vet nurses at the @entity3 , @entity16			1
she has put @entity2 on a strict diet , he is now fed less than two cups of low - calorie dry cat food per day			1
on his new diet , @entity2 should lose about 250g per week , which would put him on track to be a much healthier animal			2
though his weight loss will present an interesting challenge to the @entity3 vets			2
' i 'm not sure what we 're going to do with all his skin when he 's done , he might need a nip and a tuck , ' said ms @entity8			0
' i 'm sure we can find a vet who can deal with it			0
' the cat weighs 14.3kg , almost three times its ideal weight of five to six kg			1

sumo has *astonished* @entity3 staff and is the biggest cat they 've ever seen
he weighs 14.3kg , almost three times his ideal weight of five to six kg
staff at the @entity3 in @entity9 have put him on a special low - calorie diet
