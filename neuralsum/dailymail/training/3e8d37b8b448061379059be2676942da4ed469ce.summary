@entity1 ’s @entity0 remains in @entity3 ’s thoughts @entity4 has challenged @entity5 to sort out his attitude as @entity3 ’s new - look side continue their search for a front - line spinner			1
with @entity12 no longer on the scene and with @entity5 out of favour , @entity11 ’s team had to settle for 16 wicketless overs of part - time off - spin from @entity17 and @entity18 on monday as they narrowly failed to dismiss @entity19 on the final day of the first @entity20 at @entity21			1
‘ we are going to have to identify our next spinner , there ’s no doubt about that , ’ said @entity3 coach @entity22			1
‘ especially when we go away , otherwise it is going to be a weakness in our ranks that people will try to exploit			0
bad attitude ? @entity5 has been challenged to become @entity3 's front line spinner by @entity4 rotation policy : @entity17 ( @entity35 ) and @entity18 led @entity3 's spinners in the narrow defeat to @entity19 ‘ @entity5 is the most experienced test bowler out there , but through other issues he has made it difficult to look at him at the moment			1
the key for @entity5 is to bowl well and get his things right , and then put himself up for selection like anyone else			0
‘ there are two things : people have to be in the right place to play from an attitudinal point of view , but also they have to be playing well enough			0
’ @entity1 ’s slow left - armer @entity0 remains in @entity3 ’s thoughts , and there are high hopes for @entity57 ’s 22 - year - old off - spinner @entity56			1
@entity5 , though , remains the classiest option			2
his 50 tests have brought him 167 wickets and , at 32 , he ought to be in his prime			0
his form with @entity63 is not an immediate concern : he has 22 championship wickets this summer at 29 apiece			0
but he was dropped for the @entity67 game against @entity68 at the start of the month after forgetting to turn up for a team meeting			0
class act : @entity5 has brought down 167 wickets in 50 tests during his @entity3 career that followed a warning from @entity63 about his body language earlier in the season , and a row with @entity81 ’s @entity80			1
last summer , @entity5 was given a wide berth by @entity3 after urinating on nightclub bouncers in @entity84			2
meanwhile , @entity11 has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee after @entity3 were deemed to have fallen one over short of the required rate for the @entity88			0
talking strategy : @entity3 captain @entity11 speaks with coach @entity4 during a nets session at @entity21			2

@entity5 has been challenged to change his attitude by @entity4
@entity3 are in search of a front line spinner in their new - look side
@entity5 has been playing for @entity63 but doubts remain over his attitude
@entity1 ’s @entity0 remains in @entity3 ’s thoughts
