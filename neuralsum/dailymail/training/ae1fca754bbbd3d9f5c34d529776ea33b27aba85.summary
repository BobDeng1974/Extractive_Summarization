@entity0 was quick to praise the fighting spirit of his @entity3 team after @entity4 has scraped a late - and barely deserved - draw at @entity6 on sunday			1
' ( @entity3 ) showed a lot of resilience in the second - half ... i must say what spirit from my team , â€™ enthused the @entity11			2
but the reality is that @entity3 have shown precious little ' spirit ' or ' resilience ' this season - with the notable exception of goalkeeper @entity18 , who has bailed them out of trouble on many an occasion			2
despite @entity25 's praise , under his leadership @entity3 have not won a single game in the @entity27 after conceding the first goal of a match			1
@entity4 ( left ) rescued a point for @entity0 's @entity3 with a last - minute strike at @entity6 @entity0 's first league game in charge at @entity3 was a defeat by @entity35 after conceding first @entity36 have not fought back to win at any point this season , including during this defeat by @entity40 this season @entity3 have let slip the first goal of the game on eight occasions			1
the best results @entity25 's men have salvaged from these fixtures were draws against @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity6			1
the other three games ended in defeats by @entity35 , @entity53 and @entity40			0
it is all a stark contrast from the halcyon days under sir @entity56 's management , when @entity3 were famed for their fighting spirit , often scoring decisive goals in the dying moments after the referee 's watch had ticked beyond 90 minutes			1
' @entity62 ' has gone down in legend			0
the most memorable of all @entity3 's last - gasp goals are arguably @entity66 's two headers against @entity67 in 1993			2
the late double averted a defeat during a crucial stage of the title race and kept @entity3 on course for their first league crown in 26 years			2
@entity56 and his assistant @entity73 danced on the @entity75 turf in delight			0
and while they were not @entity27 strikes , @entity79 and @entity81 's injury - time goals against @entity82 in the 1999 @entity84 final may never be beaten for jaw - dropping drama or sheer bloody - mindedness			0
@entity66 celebrates his dramatic winning goal against @entity88 wednesday in 1993 but even after @entity56 's retirement , under the much - maligned @entity90 the @entity89 managed to fight back and win from a losing position on four occasions			2
and the @entity94 did not even complete a full season in charge at @entity75			0
@entity3 's reputation as comeback kings reached its zenith during @entity56 's final season at the helm			1
in 2012 - 13 they fought back to win from a losing position on nine occasions , the highest number during any of the @entity94 's 26 years in charge			0
@entity106 celebrates one of his two goals in the comeback victory at @entity110 in december 2013 @entity111 ( left ) strikes as his hat - trick secured a win from behind at @entity40 in september 2012 the previous best seasons for @entity3 fightbacks were in 1999 - 2000 and 2002 - 03 , when six matches were won from behind			0
@entity56 's @entity3 did , however , fail to win a single match when conceding the first goal during two full terms			1
that said , during one of those seasons @entity3 managed arguably their greatest fightback of all - but not in a single match			0
trailing by 12 points at one stage in 1995 - 96 , @entity3 reeled in league leaders @entity127 and left @entity128 ranting how he would ' love it ' if he were to beat @entity62 to the title			0
he did n't and nothing better summed up the mental fortitude of the @entity56 era			0
by comparison , a late draw at @entity6 renders @entity25 's claims to ' resiliance ' somewhat feeble			1
@entity128 during his infamous ' i would love it if we beat them ... love it ' rant at sir @entity56 on tv			1

@entity4 rescued a draw for @entity3 at @entity6
@entity0 praised his team 's ' spirit ' and ' resiliance '
but @entity25 's side has not won one match after conceding first this term
it is a far *cry* from @entity3 's glory years under sir @entity56
