to many , the name @entity1 is synonymous with code - breaking glory by the @entity3 during @entity4			1
after all , it was there that @entity8 @entity7 and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the @entity13 ' enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years			2
but now , the @entity17 government has launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the enigma code			1
in 1932 , a group of cryptologists from the @entity25 - @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity22 - discovered three ways of deciphering @entity30 readings			1
although the @entity21 ( deciphering machine , left ) was cracked by @entity8 @entity7 ( right ) and his team at @entity1 during @entity4 , the @entity17 feels their crucial contribution has been overlooked seven years later , just before war broke out , the @entity17 handed over their knowledge of the @entity21 codes , as well as @entity17 - built replicas of the machines , to @entity3 and @entity40 intelligence officers near @entity41			1
the rest is history - but not the complete history , as far as senator @entity45 is concerned			0
' we have a duty to remind people just what the @entity17 cryptologists did , ' he told the @entity52			2
the government official said that in recognition of the trio 's efforts , the upper house of @entity17 's parliament has passed a resolution in their honour to ' restore justice '			1
@entity17 's parliament has launched a campaign so @entity17 cryptographers are credited for helping to crack the @entity13 ' enigma code			2
above , @entity1 , @entity66 , where the breakthrough is said to have shortened the war by two years the resolution reads : ' in both popular literature and official information , the public was told that the breaking of the @entity21 codes was due to the work of the @entity3 intelligence services to the complete omission of the work of @entity17 scientists			1
' the @entity81 , who had been using the technology since the late 1920s , believed the codes were impossible to crack			0
using a complicated system of rotors , the machine would encode messages before sending them via @entity88 to another machine			0
if the receiving machine had been programmed with the same settings - one of 158 million million million combinations - the message would be deciphered			0
however the team of cryptologists , linguists , scientists and data analysts at @entity99 , in @entity66 , led by @entity100 , were able to break it			0
overlooked : @entity102 starred in the 2001 @entity3 - produced film , @entity30 , which makes little mention of the @entity17 ' contribution at its peak , the team was cracking 6,000 encrypted @entity81 @entity30 messages every day - building on the principles set out by @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity22			1
@entity110 , a senator from the governing @entity112 party , said : ' this resolution restores justice			0
not only did the @entity115 marginalise the achievements of @entity17 cryptographers but the @entity118 did the same			2
' they were silent about the @entity17 contribution to saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of troops fighting on all fronts			0
' the film @entity30 ( made in 2001 ) , starring @entity102 and set at @entity99 , has also upset the @entity17 - it not only downplays their contribution but also , the only @entity125 in the film is a traitor			1
the resentment adds to the wider feeling in the country that their contribution to the @entity134 â€™ victory has been under - appreciated			0
@entity17 troops fought in @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 , and took part in the @entity140			0
in the @entity142 , @entity17 pilots had the highest kill rates			0
yet @entity17 troops - still under the command of @entity17 's independent government in exile - were forbidden from taking part in official @entity150 celebrations due to @entity3 's wish to appease @entity152			1
working away : wrens at @entity1 used principles developed by the @entity17 to continue to decipher the @entity30			2

in 1932 , a group of cryptologists from the @entity25 found three ways to decipher @entity30
@entity17 handed their findings to @entity3 and @entity40 intelligence in 1939
@entity17 government passes resolution in honour of their three code - cracking mathematicians
