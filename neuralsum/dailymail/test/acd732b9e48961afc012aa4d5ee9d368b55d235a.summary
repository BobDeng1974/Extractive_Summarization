he 's all three emergency services rolled into one			1
@entity2 has become the first person to be trained and equipped as a so - called first responder to all types of 999 call			1
mr @entity2 , 28 , will be working with one pc and two @entity8 in @entity9 in @entity10 where the emergency services have been brought together under one roof			1
@entity13 : @entity2 is trained to respond to crimes , fires and medical emergencies new role : father - of - two mr @entity2 has taken up his unique role in @entity9 in @entity20 as ' @entity21 ' , he does not have the power to make arrests and will mostly be patrolling his beat and spreading safety messages while on hand to respond to most 999 calls			1
@entity29 and @entity20 assistant chief constable @entity28 said there were plans to introduce the post to other areas			1
he said : ' the tri-service officer is a ground - breaking idea			0
it brings together the skills and training of the three emergency services into one individual			2
' father of two mr @entity2 said : ' i want to become a familiar face in the community , someone the public are happy to see and who can respond to any incident or enquiry			2
' he applied for the role after eight years as a fireman , training as an emergency first responder , and completing a @entity8 course			2
badge of honour : he is called a ' tri-service safety officer ' however , @entity29 and @entity58 chairman @entity57 said the new role would never be the same as having a fully - trained policeman , paramedic and fireman on call			1
he dismissed the new job as a ' publicity stunt ' designed to reassure the public rather than provide any effective policing			2
he said : ' i do n't see what there is to gain from it apart from some sort of public reassurance			0
maybe the money should be better spent on full warranted police officers			0
' he also said he could not see it catching on , adding : ' to do all three would be impossible and you would n't be able to obtain your professional competencies			0
' ready to go : mr @entity2 will mostly be patrolling his beat and spreading safety messages in his new role former @entity86 officer @entity85 said the job was unlikely to be represent the future of the emergency services as it would only really suit small , quiet , and rural beats			1
he said : ' if someone is able to accumulate all those numerous skills in becoming a jack or master of all trades that is fine			0
' but realistically people join the police to be policemen , the fire service to be firefighters , and the ambulance service to be paramedics			0
' finding a good number of people that are able to qualify in all three is asking an awful lot			0
' it is a great idea in a rural community but a bit of a non-starter in bigger towns and cities			0
