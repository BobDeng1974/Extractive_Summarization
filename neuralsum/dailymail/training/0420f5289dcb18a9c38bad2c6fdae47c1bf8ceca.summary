almost the entire population of @entity13 , including 400 women and children , was gunned down or burned alive in a single day by @entity17 troops on june 10 , 1944			1
more than 68 years later , a @entity19 prosecutor and senior police officers have visited the abandoned village in central @entity6 , which @entity22 troops burned to the ground before they fled			1
@entity19 authorities believe there may still be six men still at large , all now in their late 80s , who were members of @entity29 that committed the atrocity			1
an investigation for crimes of war is led by @entity19 and @entity6 authorities 68 years after the 1944 massacre other investigations into the massacre have been started over the past 60 years , but all earlier probes were abandoned due to lack of evidence the team of investigators from @entity45 ( pictured ) want to speak to the only two living survivors of the bloodbath , carried out in revenge for the capture of a @entity19 officer by @entity6 resistance fighters in a nearby village the village has been left untouched since the massacre to serve both as a shrine to those who died and as a constant reminder of the unremitting evil of the @entity59			1
the team of investigators from @entity45 want to speak to the only two living survivors of the bloodbath , carried out in revenge for the capture of a @entity19 officer by @entity6 resistance fighters in a nearby village			1
although several probes have previously been opened into the massacre , they had to be shut down due to a lack of evidence			0
but when a historian in 2010 discovered documents implicating all six suspects , still alive and now aged between 85 and 86 , the case had enough evidence to be re-opened			1
the documents were found in files kept by the @entity77 , former @entity2 's feared and hated secret police			2
the @entity19 authorities are under constant pressure from @entity82 and human rights pressure groups to round up @entity8 war criminals before they die			1
the latest probe into the @entity13 massacre comes after detectives from @entity45 re-opened an investigation three years ago into another mass murder of 124 people in the @entity6 village of @entity91 in august 1944 , but no culprits have yet been brought to justice			1
the women and children were herded into the village church where @entity17 troopers had soaked the church pews with petrol and barred all exits			2
fire grenades were tossed among the villagers and those that survived were later burned alive as a reprisal for attacks on @entity19 soldiers occupying @entity6 by members of the @entity108			1
more than 200 men were herded into a barn where machine gunners opened fire , shooting at their legs so they could not move then dousing them with petrol and setting them alight			2
the village has purposely been left untouched since the massacre , to serve both as a shrine to those who died and as a constant reminder of the unremitting evil of the @entity59 @entity124 prosecutor @entity123 told @entity6 reporters in @entity13 : ' we hope the survivors may be able to help us identify any culprits who are still alive ' remains of a burnt out vehicle			1
a new village of @entity13 was built nearby which is now home to more than 2,000 people , while the abandoned village is popular with tourists curious about the war rows of burnt out cars reveal the extent to which the @entity59 obliterated the town in 1944 the remains of the church in which 247 women and 205 children were trapped and killed by the @entity59			1
the middle window behind the altar is the one through which the only survivor @entity148 escaped @entity17 lieutenant @entity150 was the only man to serve time for the massacre a new village of @entity13 was built nearby which is now home to more than 2,000 people			1
@entity154 , 87 - was one of only six villagers who escaped the carnage - said : ' it is a very strange moment to see @entity19 officials here 68 years later			1

' @entity124 prosecutor @entity123 told @entity6 reporters in @entity13 : ' we hope the survivors may be able to help us identify any culprits who are still alive			1
' three trials of 30 former @entity17 officers have taken place since 1953 , but only one man , @entity17 - @entity176 @entity150 , was ever convicted			2
in 1953 a @entity6 military tribunal sentenced 21 @entity8 soldiers to death for the atrocities they committed			1
they were never executed and their sentences commuted in the name of ‘ national reconciliation ’ between @entity6 and @entity2			2
the only man convicted was @entity176 @entity150 , who gave the order to shoot 20 male victims			1
@entity150 was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1983 and released in 1997			2
he died ten years later in august 2007			0

i had escaped from the killing and was without injury so i made use of a smoke cloud to slip behind the altar			0
in this part of the church there are three windows			0
i made for the widest one in the middle and with the help of a stool used to light the candles , i tried to reach it			0
