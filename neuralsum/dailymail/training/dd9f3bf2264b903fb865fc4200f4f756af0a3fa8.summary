@entity0 may be one of the cheapest places to go skiing , and ahead of the half - term holidays it may just be the best			1
heavy snowfall around the @entity6 has left skiing conditions in the @entity9 country being described as ' amazing , ' and the forecast does n't look likely to change over the next few days			1
in - resort costs have dropped as much as 23 per cent on last year in @entity0 , with @entity12 providing the cheapest option for a ski trip , according to the latest stats from @entity16			2
heavy snowfall across the @entity6 will be music to the ears of those planning a ski trip to the region with much of @entity9 under a deluge of snow , this opens up some tricky decisions as to which ski resort will offer the best overall deal it may be good news for skiers , but heavy snow on the @entity6 has not being met with similar enthusiasm by townsfolk the @entity0 ski resort of @entity12 has seen the biggest slide with a 23 per cent price reduction at resort this takes into account costs such as equipment , six - day passes , lessons and food and drink			1
around six - and - a - half feet of snow was reported to have fallen in @entity0 last week , with ski resorts expecting the conditions to attract a raft of tourists over the holidays			1
once the falling snow ceases , visibility will improve which mean @entity0 could be the place to go this ski season			2
@entity56 , from the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) told @entity58 : ' when looking at the cost of a ski pass to compare relative costs in popular ski destinations across @entity9 , those travelling to @entity0 will be paying around 45 euros for an adult compared to 49 euros in @entity65 in @entity66 or 50 euros in @entity67			1
' eating out is n't too expensive - in @entity0 a meal for two in a mid-range restaurant can be had for around 35 euros , whereas it 's a little cheaper in @entity67 d'sere and @entity65 at around 30 euros * *			2
' so while ski pass costs are slightly cheaper and meals slightly more expensive than neighbouring ski destinations in @entity66 , the real cost benefit of going to @entity0 right now is that skiers can capitalise on the weakness of the @entity75 , which is accepted widely in the country			1
' last february , £ 1 bought 1.17 euros , this year it 's around 1.30 offering a saving of around £ 4 on a ski pass			0
' and @entity66 , while generally being at the other end of the cost scale to @entity0 , is also likely to be a popular destination , with five feet of snow falling in @entity84 and @entity85			1
@entity67 has been the big winner in @entity66 , with the @entity88 ski resort recording a depth of 5ft 7ins of snow on the upper pistes			2
upper pistes in @entity93 in the @entity66 @entity94 have over 5ft of snow			0
after they scrapped the @entity75 cap on the @entity98 , a rise against the @entity75 has even led to many cancelling prospective ski trips to @entity100 due to fears of escalating prices			0
but @entity103 offers high thrills to the skier , with the highest pistes holding a 190cm - deep snow base			0
with pistes rising to 3,100m under the @entity110 , @entity108 is also a popular destination			0
and with the heavy snowfall comes the evident cold snap , temperatures around @entity9 have fallen well below zero , so the advice to skiers would be to wrap up at all times			2
while heavy snowfall in the @entity6 is good for skiers , getting out there may prove problematic depending on how you travel @entity122 has also been hit byheavy snowfall , with the small towns of @entity125 and @entity126 , in the @entity6 , buried a woman walks along the road on a winter 's day in the small town of @entity131 , in the @entity6 mountains in northern @entity122 @entity85 is also benefitting from heavy snowfall , with over 5ft reported in the last few days meaning joy for those on the slopes a traffic signal is covered by the snow in the @entity6 small town of @entity126 , northern @entity122 , with temperatures well below freezing prices have plunged downhill at ski resorts , offering @entity145 winter sports enthusiasts good value for money this year			1
total costs were at their lowest in @entity149 in @entity150 ( £ 261 ) , while other good - value resorts were @entity152 in @entity153 ( £ 300 ) , @entity154 in @entity155 ( £ 311 ) and @entity156 in @entity157 ( £ 322 )			0
priciest of the @entity9 resorts surveyed was @entity108 in @entity100 ( £ 687 )			0
for the best family deals , @entity149 ( £ 848 ) remains the cheapest skiing for a family of four			0
however , @entity152 ( £ 1,110 ) has lost its runner up position because of a significant 18 per cent price fall in both @entity12 ( £ 982 ) and @entity154 ( £ 985 ) .			0
