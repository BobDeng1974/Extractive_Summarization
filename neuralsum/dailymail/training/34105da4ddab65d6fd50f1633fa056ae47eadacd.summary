@entity1 resistance forces have this morning symbolically raised their flag over the @entity4 hillside where the @entity6 's black jihadist banner was destroyed in a devastating @entity8 airstrike only hours before			1
in a series of dramatic images , @entity10 militants were seen standing by the flag on @entity14 near the @entity16 border yesterday afternoon - after the terrorist group seized control of the strategically important hilltop , which lies two and a half miles to the west of the town			1
just moments later the hillside erupted into flames with one militant running for his life and another fighter appearing to stand his ground before being engulfed by an enormous cloud of smoke and dust caused by the ferocious power of the weapon			0
this morning the massive airstrike was revealed to be as strategically important as it was symbolic , with members of the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) seen raising their own yellow banner over @entity41 - suggesting the crucial hillside is once again in the hands of resistance fighters			1
the crucial hillside is once again free of @entity10 militants not aware : @entity10 ' black jihadist flag was obliterated in a devastating @entity8 airstrike on the @entity4 hillside yesterday afternoon			1
the area had been under the control of @entity10 for the past few weeks , with militants pictured walking on the hill only seconds before the blast blast : just moments after the above photograph was taken , the hillside erupted into flames			2
one militant standing on the hill appears to be calmy watching the blast , despite it occuring only feet away and causing a massive cloud of dust to roll towards him explosion : the @entity6 militant can be seen seemingly standing his ground as clouds of dust roll down the hillside			0
the pictures were taken using a long lens camera from across the border in @entity16 's @entity80 village , in @entity82 province devastating : the hillside was completely obliterated in the attack - said to be launched by @entity8 forces			0
the images emerged as @entity8 and @entity88 jets launched fresh attacks on @entity10 positions in the north of @entity4 smoke : @entity16 , which has riled @entity1 leaders and frustrated @entity94 by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into @entity4 , said this week it would help @entity98 @entity1 fighters cross into @entity99 to help their brethren against the militants yesterday 's massive airstrike came after the terrorist group made a renewed assault on @entity4 after being pushed out of the centre of the besieged @entity99 city by hundreds of brave @entity1 resistance fighters the @entity39 forces are believed to have made their massive advances by coordinating fierce street battles with the @entity8 and @entity88 bombing raids - forcing the well - equipped jihadis to retreat into the outskirts of @entity4			1
one key location the jihadists managed to retain , however , was the strategically important @entity41 hill in the @entity4 suburbs - where the chilling site of their black flag has been flying for the past three weeks			1
all that changed yesterday evening , when @entity8 warplanes carried out the massive airstrike that destroyed the @entity10 flag and allowed the brave @entity1 troops to symbolically raise their own banner over @entity41			2
although the bulk of @entity10 have now been pushed outside @entity4 , small cells are still thought to operating inside the city			0
yesterday the group 's flag could clearly still be seen inside city , raised over a multi-storey building just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow , triangular flag of the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) was seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex			2
the chilling image of the @entity10 flag still flying in @entity4 emerged as lawmakers in @entity98 's largely autonomous @entity1 region authorized peshmerga forces to cross into neighboring @entity99 to help fellow @entity1 combat @entity6 militants in the city , providing much - needed boots on the ground			2
the unprecedented deployment will almost certainly depend on the support of @entity16 , whose president criticized a @entity8 airdrop of arms to @entity1 fighters after some of the weapons wound up in the hands of the extremists			0
chilling : @entity10 ' black jihadist flag ( background ) was still visible in @entity4 this morning - despite @entity1 territorial gains and weeks of sustained airstrikes by @entity8 and @entity88 warplanes smoke rises over @entity4 this morning following an @entity8 airstrike on an @entity10 - held building in the besieged @entity99 city @entity8 airstrikes on buildings held by the @entity6 inside @entity4 cause large clouds of smoke to rise over the city the fallout from a separate explosion after an airstrike seen from the @entity16 side of the border , near @entity175 district , @entity176 , @entity16 clouds : smoke and dust rise over @entity99 town of @entity4 after another airstrike , as seen from the @entity182 crossing on the @entity16 - @entity99 border in the southeastern town of @entity175 in @entity82 province yesterday @entity4 has seen intensive fighting over the past few weeks , and @entity1 forces appear to be turning the tide against @entity10 chilling : @entity10 ' black jihadist flag ( background ) was still visible in @entity4 yesterday - despite @entity1 territorial gains and weeks of sustained airstrikes by @entity8 and @entity88 warplanes			1
the flag is just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow , triangular flag of the @entity38 can be seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex ( foreground ) a shepherd tends his flock in the outskirts of the @entity99 town of @entity4 yesterday as fighting between @entity10 and @entity1 continues smoke and dust is seen rising over the @entity99 town of @entity4 after @entity8 warplanes carry out a bombing raid on @entity6 targets @entity16 , which has riled @entity1 leaders and frustrated @entity94 by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into @entity4 , said this week it would help @entity98 @entity1 fighters cross into @entity99 to help their brethren against the militants , who also are being attacked by a @entity8 - led campaign of airstrikes			1
but it is not clear how many fighters will be allowed in or whether they will be allowed to carry enough weapons to make an impact			0
the @entity1 of @entity99 and @entity98 have become a major focal point in the war against the @entity6 group , with @entity1 populations in both countries coming under significant threat by the militants ' lightning advance			0
lt. gen. @entity229 , the outgoing commander of @entity231 's @entity230 in @entity232 , @entity16 , said the @entity16 have agreed to open up ' a land bridge of sorts ' so that the peshmerga can get into @entity4 to help with the fighting there			0
' it seems to me that between the @entity8 , @entity16 and other countries , they are figuring out what is permissible to make sure that @entity10 is not successful and that it is something that @entity16 can live with , ' he added , using an acronym for the group .			0

resistance fighters this morning raised their yellow flag over @entity41 hill , which @entity10 had held for several weeks
symbolic gesture came just hours after @entity8 warplanes obliterated terror group 's black banner on the hill
@entity10 militants were yesterday seen standing with black jihadist flag on @entity41 , which is two miles west of @entity4
just moments later the strategically important hillside burst into flames after being struck by @entity8 missiles
