resplendent in a chic burgundy coat and a killer spiky necklace , @entity2 of the @entity3 was on top fashionable form as she stepped out in the @entity5 today			2
but for once , she had competition , which arrived in the form of the ever - fashionable @entity8 of @entity9 , who with her husband @entity10 , landed in the @entity3 capital @entity12 this morning to begin a tour of the @entity3			1
@entity8 and @entity2 did n't have it all their own way , however , and were run close in the style stakes by their dapper husbands , with @entity10 cutting a particularly dashing figure in his pinstriped suit			2
@entity8 , 42 , and @entity2 , 43 , who spent much of the @entity34 meeting seated together , also appeared delighted to be together again , exchanging warm kisses and smiles as they met on the steps of the @entity42			1
the two couples , who were joined for a meeting by @entity3 prime minister , @entity45 , are among the youngest - and newest - monarchs in @entity47 , with @entity28 taking the @entity3 throne last year and @entity10 ascending to the @entity9 in june			1
his father , 76 - year - old @entity49 , said at the time that the decision was made because ' i do n't want my son to grow old waiting like @entity54 '			0
he formally abdicated on the 18th june , making him the fourth @entity47 monarch to do so in less than a year - pope @entity56 , queen @entity57 and @entity58 having all stepped down in 2013			0
close : the couples were last seen together during a visit to @entity35 where both kings addressed the @entity34 lovely to see you again : @entity28 also had a kiss and some welcoming words for @entity8 looking good : @entity8 kept it simple in a plain red dress while @entity2 chose a more elaborate burgundy look ready for their guests : the @entity3 couple had waited on the steps of the @entity42 for their guests first thing 's first : before being ushered inside , @entity10 spent some time waving at assembled well - wishers despite the abdications of @entity57 and @entity49 , the @entity57 has stated that she has no plans to abdicate , with @entity77 sources confirming that she will never relinquish the @entity80 throne			1
one monarch who may yet do so is @entity83 's @entity82 , 74 , who has been on the @entity83 throne for 42 years and has an heir , @entity85 , of the same age as @entity10			0
however , despite claims in an @entity91 magazine that an announcement is imminent , sources close to the @entity83 queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as ' all lies '			0
for their part , @entity8 and @entity10 have enjoyed a busy three months since ascending to the @entity9 throne on the 19th june , with several international tours already under their belt			1
and they 're off : @entity28 then led the way as the couple made their way into the @entity42 together again : after greeting the @entity9 royals , their @entity3 counterparts swiftly ushered them inside reunited : the two queens were last seen together during a visit to the @entity34 in @entity35 last month more recently , the pair have attended events all over @entity9 , including a trip to the @entity112 in @entity113 last week , and have spearheaded major national events such as @entity9 national day on sunday			2
but while @entity8 and @entity10 's reign has so far gone smoothly , @entity2 and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks in part to the @entity122 tragedy , which left the @entity3 reeling			2
since the crash , the popularity of the @entity125 - born @entity3 queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the @entity122 families			0
she has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside prime minister @entity45 as the first flight arrived back on @entity3 soil			0
more recently , the @entity3 royals have found themselves cheered to the rafters during public appearances , most notably when they appeared on the balcony of the @entity42 in the @entity5 on @entity140 [ @entity140 ] , along with the former @entity57 , 76 @entity2 has also become a familiar sight at charity events around the @entity3 , with her most recent outing being at a symposium organised by women 's rights activists in @entity12 , which celebrated the 40th birthday of a @entity3 law banning domestic violence			0
on their way : the couples were still chatting as they made their way into the @entity42 in the @entity5 photo op : as they made their way through the courtyard , the two couples stopped for a quick photo joining in : @entity3 prime minister @entity45 was also on hand to welcome @entity8 and @entity10 to the @entity5 talks : along with @entity28 , mr @entity45 met @entity10 and @entity8 who represent the @entity9 government beginning : the @entity9 royal couple are now at the start of a brief tour of the @entity3			1

@entity8 , 42 , was welcomed to the @entity42 by @entity2 , 43
the @entity9 royal couple arrived in the @entity5 this morning for a tour
@entity28 , 47 , exchanged hugs with @entity10 , 46 , as he greeted him
the two couples are among the youngest - and newest - *rulers* in @entity47
