a report by the @entity1 reveals policemen in @entity3 are arresting young women in order to rape them			1
@entity1 ceo @entity6 , pictured , called the findings ' disturbing ' a shocking report has revealed how large numbers of policemen in @entity3 are ' regularly ' arresting young women in order to rape them			2
the ' @entity11 ' conducted by the @entity13 - based @entity12 , investigated the extent in which police officers in the country plan and execute serious and violent crimes such as murder , rape , and armed robbery			1
and it drew a disturbing conclusion : that police involvement in serious and violent crimes , including rape and murder , were a ' pattern of behaviour ' and not isolated incidents			1
the report , funded by @entity31 , analysed 100 randomly chosen media reports from april 2011 to january 2015 on alleged police involvement in serious crimes			1
of those , 32 were murders and attempted murders , 22 were armed robberies , and 26 were rapes , as well as other serious offences			1
the results were compared against two sources of information on disciplinary action against police officers implicated in crimes			2
the project has been undertaken by the @entity1 since 2011 to track police involvement in criminality			2
in 2015 , it found that officers exploit their official status and equipment to perpetrate crimes and rely on that status to escape arrest and prosecution			0
significant numbers of officers , despite being convicted of serious crimes , remain employed with the police the most worrying aspect was that ' it is often with good reason that the public fear the police , especially with regard to sexual violence and rape perpetrated by officers against vulnerable women			1
' in a number of incidents , the police officer used his authority to force the victims to submit to his demands			0
in one incident , a woman was raped several times while in custody and in another , a woman was raped in court			0
nine out of the 26 listed rape cases occurred in either police station cells or official police vehicles			0
the report says in a typical case , a police officer would stop a young woman in a public place , before taking her away to be raped in the back of a police vehicle and then setting her free			1
it found a ' significant evidence of a trend ' where police officers detain women in order to rape them			1
a 2011 version of the report had similar results , including a serious problem with sexual violence by police officers in a country which has one of the highest recorded rates of rape in the world			2
and while @entity115 management is attempting to deal with the problem , it is with limited success			0
it warned that ' violent crime levels in @entity3 wo n’t turn around while the " wolf guards the sheep "			1
' the report said a typical case involved an officer stopping a young woman in a public place , before taking her away to be raped in the back of a police vehicle			1
file photo @entity129 reported in july 2013 , that almost 1 500 serving police officers had criminal records as shown on the table below – this is more than one in every 100 sworn officers a report in @entity129 in july 2013 said that almost 1,500 serving police officers had criminal records - which is more than one in every 100 officers in the country			2
a two - year audit into the police service revealed there were even @entity115 members behind bars who were paid monthly salaries			0
the newspaper reported that the shadow minister of police , @entity149 of the @entity151 , had said that the police were , in effect , admitting that their service was ' populated with murderers , rapists , fraudsters and other offenders '			0
@entity1 ceo @entity6 said that the project is one of the most disturbing ever undertaken by his organisation			0
he said : ' you would expect the police to safeguard society by infiltrating criminal elements			0
' in our country there is much evidence that criminal elements have infiltrated the police			0
' the number of complaints made to the @entity174 by the category of complaint and the number the @entity174 says have been successfully handled by some form of disciplinary action			0
