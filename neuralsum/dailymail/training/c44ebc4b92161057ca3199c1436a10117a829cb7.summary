a couple got a shock when they noticed their unborn baby ’s ultrasound scan looked like the evil galactic overlord from the @entity8 movies , @entity9			2
@entity10 , 39 , was having her 20 - week scan with husband @entity12 , 33 , in @entity13 , @entity14 , when they caught sight of the shadowy dark lord apparently lurking inside her womb			1
they immediately recognised the image as that of @entity23 's power - hungry nemesis , dark side devotee and mentor to @entity26 , known in later episodes as @entity9			1
but fortunately , four months later when the baby , real name @entity31 , emerged from the shadows of @entity10 's uterus , the couple were relieved to find he looked nothing like the malevolent tyrant , played in the films by @entity38 actor @entity37			1
evil surprise : mother @entity40 , 39 , immediately spotted the seemingly cloaked figure during the ultrasound during the 20th week of her pregnancy and pointed out it looked just like @entity9 , right			1
@entity12 said : ' during the ultrasound , @entity10 noticed that one of the images appeared to look like @entity9 from @entity8			0
' at this point , everyone in the room had a laugh , including our eight - year - old daughter @entity52 and the ultrasound technician			0
' at the end of the ultrasound , the tech asked us if we would like to include that image on our take - home cd , since we were so amused			0
' evil baby : @entity12 only realised the scan of his son @entity31 , who is now eight months old , would cause a fuss among @entity8 fans when he uploaded it to his webpage last week @entity12 only realised the scan of his son @entity31 , who is now eight months old , would cause a fuss among @entity8 fans when he uploaded it to his webpage last week			2
