relief around the @entity1 quickly gave way to realisation that @entity4 have fallen seven points behind @entity6			1
the @entity8 champions narrowly avoided a third straight home defeat , but this will go down as a serious stumble in the title race			1
@entity14 ’s side have now failed to win in their last five games here , including those setbacks in the league and cup to @entity19 and @entity20			2
it could have been worse had @entity22 not curled a magnificent 25 - yard freekick around @entity25 ’s defensive wall deep into injury - time to deny the relegation strugglers their first away win over @entity4 in 85 years			1
@entity22 ( right ) proved @entity4 's hero by scoring an injury time equaliser as @entity4 drew 1 - 1 at home with @entity25 @entity22 ( centre ) curled home an unstoppable free - kick from close range that broke @entity25 hearts and salvaged a point for @entity4 @entity25 goalkeeper @entity37 is sprawled on the floor dejected after being beaten so late on by @entity22 's set - piece the @entity40 international ( left ) celebrates his strike with team - mate @entity43 as @entity4 rescue a point @entity4 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity45 5 ; @entity43 5.5 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 5 , @entity48 6 ; @entity49 6.5 , @entity50 4.5 ( @entity51 46 , 6 ) , @entity52 5.5 , @entity53 6 ( @entity54 74 , 6 ) ; @entity55 6.5 , @entity56 5 ( @entity22 66 , 7 )			1

‘ @entity6 have a big lead now , ’ he admitted			1
‘ it was n’t good enough			0
we knew it would be tough against a spirited side but we ’ve slipped up at home again			0
‘ over 90 minutes we did n’t do what we should have done , and we need to re-group and come back again			2
‘ you look at our success in recent seasons and it was built on solid home form			0
it shows we now need to make up the ground away from home			0
’ despite @entity4 ’s wealth of options – their bench alone cost £ 130million compared to the £ 21.5m it took to build @entity25 ’s entire starting line - up – they once again struggled to unlock a team who defended stubbornly			1
@entity113 recalled @entity49 and @entity56 but to little effect			0
they clearly miss @entity116 whose absence at the @entity118 has coincided with the recent slump			0
@entity25 boss @entity120 ( left ) and his @entity122 counterpart @entity113 share pre-game pleasantries before their @entity8 match @entity125 ( right ) was in the @entity25 dugout for the first time since becoming @entity64 's assistant manager @entity25 midfielder @entity70 attempts to skip past the challenge of @entity43 during the opening stages of saturday 's match the visitors nearly took the lead when defender @entity67 's ( centre ) header deflected off @entity48 ( right ) and onto the post city fans make a protest at the ground as they appeal for the introduction of safestanding to @entity143 football it needed @entity22 , a 66th - minute replacement for @entity56 , to break @entity25 ’s resistance after @entity66 had fouled @entity55			1
the @entity40 midfielder will be out of contract in the summer and there is no guarantee that he will sign a new one			0
on the evidence of his strike , @entity4 should step up their efforts as soon as possible			1
@entity113 said : ‘ in 24 games , @entity22 has started 20 of them			2
i needed to make changes because in the last two games we did n’t score one goal here against @entity19 or @entity20			2
‘ he scored a beautiful goal from a freekick			2
but it ’s not about @entity22 or @entity116 , we must be a creative team again			2
once again we could n’t create space against a team with 10 players behind the ball			0
‘ before the game if you ’d said we were going to draw against @entity25 i would n’t have liked it			1
but the way we did it was not so bad with a goal in the last minute			0
’ @entity25 had lost 10 of their last 14 league games but it was clear from the start that @entity120 ’s side were not going to lie down , and they should have gone ahead in the 16th minute when @entity67 headed against the underside of the bar from @entity70 ’s cross			1
@entity25 y midfielder @entity69 scored the opening goal of the game as they took an unlikely 1 - 0 lead at @entity4 @entity69 ( left ) found himself in the @entity4 penalty area before lashing home a left - footed shot past goalkeeper @entity45 ( centre right ) @entity69 ( left ) starts to wheel away in celebration as his first half strike beats @entity45 ( right ) at his near post @entity69 ( centre ) is mobbed by his @entity25 team - mates after putting them ahead on 35 minutes at the home of the @entity8 champions @entity25 's new £ 3million signing @entity197 ( left ) came on as a second half substitute to make his debut for the club @entity45 and @entity47 had already got themselves into a muddle , taking it in in turns to hack the ball to safety with very little success , when another breakdown in communication proved even more costly in the 35th minute			1
@entity45 was on his way out of goal when @entity47 stepped in and played a poor clearance straight to @entity212			0
the @entity25 midfielder ’s shot was saved by @entity45 and ran loose to @entity215			2
@entity43 put in a challenge on @entity215 but the ball ricocheted off the @entity25 player against the post , and rolled to @entity69 to tuck home			1
it was a dog ’s dinner of a goal and one that summed up @entity4 ’s lamentable performance in the first half			1
amazingly , it was also the 10th time in 24 league games this season that they have gone behind			0
they stepped up a gear after half - time and @entity56 forced @entity37 into a rare save when he met @entity43 ’s cross with a first - time shot			0
@entity4 thought they should have had a penalty moments later , and with some justification when @entity64 barrelled into the back of @entity53 , but referee @entity240 waved away their appeals			1
@entity25 players look crestfallen at the full - time whistle after conceding a late goal against @entity4 it looked as though even a point would be beyond them when @entity55 controlled @entity49 ’s cross to the back post in the 90th minute and hammered a shot against the underside of the bar			1
@entity113 knows he has work to do – and fast – to stop @entity6 disappearing into the distance			2
‘ you are not seeing a team with doubt , ’ said the @entity4 boss			2
‘ the team is running , the team has spirit , the team has possession of the ball			0
‘ i would be more angry or disappointed if we did n’t run or we seemed like a tired team or do n’t have ideas			0
i do n’t think it ’s that			0
‘ it ’s more important to work with them than be angry because creative players like @entity49 , @entity53 , @entity55 , @entity56 or @entity273 will return to their normal performance			0

@entity69 scored the opening goal of the game on 35 minutes with a left - footed strike for @entity25
@entity22 scored a free - kick in the dying moments to equalise for the @entity8 champions
the visitors nearly took the lead on 15 minutes when @entity67 's header deflected off onto the post
result sees @entity25 move up to 17th in the table , while @entity4 now trail seven points behind league leaders @entity6
