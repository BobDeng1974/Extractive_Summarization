it is a common problem , someone delivering a package realises the recipient is n't home and is forced to take alternative action			0
but @entity7 footage outside one home in @entity9 appears to show this delivery man taking a somewhat unorthodox approach to the situation			1
after knocking on the door to no avail , he signs for the package himself , before leaving it hidden in the customer 's garage			1
breaking the rules : a delivery man is spotted on cctv camera signing for a package on behalf of a family when they are away the date stamp on the video shows the delivery taking place on december 4 last year			1
despite leaving the package behind , the courier , working for @entity30 , failed to inform the homeowner @entity31 , 49 , where his parcel was			1
consequently , @entity31 says he ' spent days chasing the delivery ' with the delivery company , part of the @entity37 , because he had no clue it was waiting for him at home all along			2
' when we called , we were told it has been delivered and we signed for it , making out we were trying to pull a fast one			0
is that his signature move ? after forging their name , he opens up their garage and drops off the parcel however , once the company got back to him confirming the date and time of the drop off , @entity31 was able to check their cctv and discover just what had happened to his order - which contained a control desk for a lighting company			1
' you ca n't just go into somebody 's property , ' @entity31 adds , ' it 's illegal as is forging someone 's signature			0
' the garage doors were locked but he somehow managed to wiggle it open which has highlighted a weakness that i have since tended to			0
' after complaining to customer service about the delivery man 's actions , he was reassured that the action was a ' serious issue ' and soon learned that the courier was sacked			1
@entity30 has told @entity74 : ' we always seek to provide the highest levels of service for our customers and are disappointed that our employee did not follow the correct procedures on this occasion			2
' we fully investigated the matter and took appropriate disciplinary action			0
we are sorry for any inconvenience caused to the customer			0
' a good deed ? whether he thought he was being helpful by dropping off the parcel or merely was being too lazy to take it back to his van , the courier did not get a good response from the residents ' we spent days chasing the delivery ! ' since he left no note , the family were unaware that their parcel had arrived			2

@entity30 delivery man can be seen waiting for door to be answered
