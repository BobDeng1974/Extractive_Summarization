two - time @entity1 champion @entity0 believes the controversy surrounding @entity4 chief executive @entity3 is symptomatic of a ' ridiculous ' wider marginalisation of women in sport			1
cyclist @entity0 , who retired after winning gold at the @entity9 , believes @entity3 should have been fired for his part in emails which made derogatory comments about women			1
@entity14 remains in his position after issuing an apology and the @entity4 has declared the matter closed			1
let off : @entity3 escaped the axe for his sexist emails speaking out : two - time @entity1 champion @entity0 says @entity3 should have been sacked the emails contained sexual innuendoes , and made jokes about ' female irrationality '			1
' it 's as disappointing as it is to be racist , ' @entity0 , speaking at @entity25 launch in @entity27 , told @entity30			1
' i think if you make comments you should be fired or worse			1
' someone of his position and reputation , if he has those thoughts they should only stay way , way , way within his own head			2
' for him to express that in an email , he basically just stuck his foot right in , like a stupid fool			1
he lost a lot of credibility			2
unfortunately i also understand that within sport it 's male dominated			2
' that 's a sorry state of affairs			2
it seems archaic that in this day and age women 's sport can be seen as something to fill in the gaps between the men 's sport			2
' asked how to resolve such an issue , @entity0 said : ' you fire them and you never , ever again re-employ them in a role of that stature , nature or importance			1
' it has been suggested that women should be pro-actively promoted to senior positions to rectify the gender imbalance			2
blast : @entity0 has branded @entity3 a ' stupid fool ' for his comments @entity0 added : ' it 's a hard thing to do because those men are never going to employ women to replace them			1
' it would be a step in the right direction , to create a more even sex workforce			0
' it 's been proven that diverse management groups are the most creative and successful			0
' you ca n't have diversity if you only have men			0
women bring a different aspect , a different angle to many scenarios and problem solving			0
' i think it would be short - sighted and almost regress if you did n't have women involved			1
' more jobs for women			0
do i have to say that ? more votes for women , that 's what it feels like			0
' it feels stupid in this day and age			1
' support : @entity0 believes women need to get behind other women women can make the difference themselves , according to @entity0			1
she said : ' people ask me what will it take to change people 's perception of women 's road racing , or women 's cycling or women 's sport in general - and it would be women supporting women			1
' if women became avid supporters of women 's sport , across the board in any scenario , i think that would make a really big difference			0
' and for women to have more managerial roles in running , organising and delivering sport , then that 's when you 'll suddenly start to get a bit of balance			0
it 's a very long - term goal			2
' @entity0 has been a trailblazer for women 's sport and in cycling , with the likes of @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and others benefiting from her profile			1
new era : @entity151 has taken on the mantle in women 's cycling the @entity160 proved there is an appetite for women 's sport in the @entity164 , who is undertaking her personal training qualifications next week , added : ' it 's really nice to see there 's an opportunity for women to have a career in cycling , in the @entity173 anyway			2
' there were steps made in the right direction with the women 's tour			0
it did get a bit of noise behind it			0
i 'm hoping it 's a positive experience			0
' i heard the crowds were good and people were very surprised			0
that 's a great thing			0
they got the support here in the @entity173			0
it 's a starting point to build on			0
