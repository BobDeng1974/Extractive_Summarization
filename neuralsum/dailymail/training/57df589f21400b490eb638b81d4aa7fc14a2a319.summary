a new ball , 40 - over ball and 80 - over ball will be used			2
' to make sure from @entity4 's perspective that everything shapes up well ... to see how the ball comes up for a tv viewer , ' @entity23 chief executive @entity45 told @entity50			1
' they 're the sort of things that indicate we 're well advanced with our thinking			0
' the ball has been the biggest stumbling block for the concept , which @entity45 hopes will ' help support and sustain the existence of @entity2 '			0
initial feedback was poor , but this season 's @entity29 trial was considered more successful			1
@entity23 is continuing to work with manufacturer @entity63 and @entity45 is confident the change in colour wo n't affect the contest			2

' outside the colour , there 's no difference to how the ball wears , the hardness and all of that			2
' anyone that is claiming anything different there , they 're certainly not looking at the balls for like - for - like comparisons			0

the experimental nature of the contest will attract a lot of interest , but the standard of cricket should help too			0
the @entity10 have been rising up the @entity141 's rankings recently , with their most recent test series loss coming in 2013			0
