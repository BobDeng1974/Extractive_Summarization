by @entity0 published : 05:39 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 07:25 est , 22 october 2013 with his bulging muscles , determined stare and orange hue , this squirrel looks like he could give any mr @entity8 competitor a run for his money			1
but the little creature has n't been hitting the weights and protein shakes and his tan definitely has n't come from a bottle			0
this cute photograph was taken by amateur photographer @entity18 , 54 , while on a visit to the @entity20 in @entity21			1
he explained that , rather than trying to strike a pose , the animal was battling against the autumnal weather and trying to stay atop his perch in a bid to get fed. strike a pose : one of the @entity20 's red squirrels , left , looks like he is set to give eight times mr @entity31 champion bodybuilder @entity30 , right , a run for his money in the bulging biceps stakes mr @entity18 said : ' he was struggling to sit on his perch , as it was such a windy day , and it was in danger of being blown forwards , so this is why its muscles are so pronounced			1
' i try to see the characters in each animal i photograph , and capture the expressions on their faces and really try to anthropomorphize them			0
' squirrels are good for this , because they have very expressive faces and movement			0
' after waiting only a matter of seconds for its food , the little red super squirrel quickly ran off in search of another person - or potential food source			1
@entity18 explains : ' the squirrels at the @entity20 are really quite tame and it and others will regularly jump on your shoulders and climb all over you			1
under threat : red squirrels , like the one pictured , could be wiped out in @entity66 in the next decade ' the wind was coming from behind it , so its ear tufts were being blown flat			1
' this is what first attracted me to take the image			0
' the red squirrel could be wiped out in @entity66 within the next decade , with fewer than 140,000 left			2
the decline of the red squirrel is due to its interaction with grey squirrels			2
the grey squirrel carries a virus , known as squirrelpox			2
but while the grey species is immune , the virus often proves deadly when passed on to reds			0
in addition , grey squirrels eat around seven times more than their red cousins and can be quite aggressive when looking for food , forcing reds out of the equation .			0
