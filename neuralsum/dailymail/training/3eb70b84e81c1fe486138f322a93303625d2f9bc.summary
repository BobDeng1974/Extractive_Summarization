by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:59 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 19:56 est , 18 june 2013 after suffering several soggy summers , it is not the news we were hoping for			2
@entity7 experts who got together to discuss recent unusual weather patterns predicted yesterday that @entity9 faces a decade of wet summers			1
they blame natural warming in the @entity12 for pushing a current of fast - flowing air in the upper atmosphere , known as the jet stream , further south			1

@entity9 could be subjected to wet summers for at least another decade , weather experts have today warned spectators make their way through the mud as they arrive for the @entity9 @entity26 at @entity27 , last july			1
six out of the last seven @entity9 summers have seen above average rainfall six out of the last seven @entity9 summers have seen above average rainfall - with just 2010 the exception			1
it is thought that long - term @entity12 currents could be playing an important role			1
weather and climate experts from across the @entity9 , who met at the @entity7 ’s hq in @entity40 today to discuss the recent run of unusual seasons in @entity43 , warned that as these operate on cycles of a decade or more , we could experience sodden summers for ' years to come '			1
however , all is not lost as while these influence the odds of wet summers , it does n’t rule out the possibility of bouts of sunshine and fine weather over the next few years - starting with tomorrow , when @entity9 is expected to bask in its hottest day of the year			1
temperatures will reach a high of @entity57 ( 78f ) today before possibly hitting @entity58 ( 86f ) tomorrow			2
but high humidity means many areas could see rain and thunderstorms tomorrow morning and evening and sunshine struggling to break through the cloud			1

professor @entity95 , head of the @entity96 and chair of the meeting , said : ' ultimately what we ’ve seen in each of these seasons is shifts in the position of the jet stream which impact our weather in certain ways at different times of year			2
' the key question is what is causing the jet stream to shift in this way ? there is some research to say some parts of the natural system load the dice to influence certain states of the jet stream , but this loading may be further amplified by climate change			0
' @entity121 , senior forecaster at @entity122 , the weather division of the @entity123 , said tomorrow 's warm weather was being carried by warm air coming up from the @entity126 , with @entity127 , @entity128 and the @entity129 seeing temperatures soar past @entity131 ( @entity132 ) in the past few days			1
' it does look as if today and tomorrow are going to be very warm , ' he said			2
' i think today will be the hottest day of the year and tomorrow will break that again			1
' temperatures should be high across @entity138 and @entity139 , with the @entity140 seeing the highest temperatures , he said			2

further north , temperatures will remain lower , and they will fall back to the low @entity177 from thursday , mr @entity121 said			2
the welcome warm blast follows what the @entity7 said was the coldest spring since 1962 , with a mean temperature across march , april and may of @entity181 ( 43f ) , 1.7c below the long - term average			1

workshops of this kind are held on a regular basis on a great deal of issues across weather and climate science			0
today ’s included sessions which looked at the strange weather patterns and their potential causes in three recent seasons – the cold winter of 2010/11 , the wet summer of 2012 , and this year ’s cold spring			2
professor @entity95 , head of the @entity96 and chair of the meeting , said : ' ultimately what we ’ve seen in each of these seasons is shifts in the position of the jet stream which impact our weather in certain ways at different times of year			0
' the key question is what is causing the jet stream to shift in this way ? ' there is some research to say some parts of the natural system load the dice to influence certain the jet stream , but this loading may be further amplified by climate change			0
' there are a number of possible factors which could be ‘ loading the dice ’ , including declining @entity249 sea ice , solar variability and long - term ocean cycles			1
the workshop focused on the latest research looking at how these drivers can influence weather patterns and discussed future research can be targeted to push forward understanding in this area			0
there are a wide range of factors that could be causing the cold winters such as changes in the @entity249 climate			0
dr @entity263 , from the @entity264 , said : ' there has been a lot of talk about declining @entity249 sea ice playing a role in our weather patterns , but really that ’s just one aspect of changes in the @entity249 climate – which has seen rapid warming compared to other parts of the world			0
' those changes mean there is less of a difference in temperature between the @entity249 and tropics , which could impact the position of the jet stream			0
' another driver of colder winter weather has already been identified and is known as @entity284 ( @entity285 )			0
recent research in this area has meant the @entity7 was able to give good advice up to a month ahead on cold spells in recent seasons when they have been driven by this phenomenon			0
professor @entity95 said : ' this workshop has looked at some really cutting edge research and helped us identify key areas for future work to improve our understanding of potential drivers of some of the unusual seasons we have seen			0
' this work will help us continue our work to push forward understanding in this area so we can give better forecasts and advice on longer timescales in the future			0
