a 38 stone man who was too obese to work has lost more than half of his body weight after taking up @entity4			1
@entity5 , 56 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , vowed to shed the pounds alongside his wife @entity8 , also 56 , after he hit 38 stone and she tipped the scales at 18 stone			1
at size @entity12 , @entity5 had to buy his clothes from specialist retailers online and was scared to sit on normal chairs			1
@entity5 , who ditched his favourite @entity30 takeaways in the evening , began struggling with his weight at a young age after his mother 's job had a calorific perk			1
he said : ' i was the fat kid at school , i was always chubby			0
i 've got a sweet tooth and my mum worked at a biscuit factory , so she was always bringing packets home			0
i spent all my pocket money on pick and mix. ' @entity5 says that it was his full - time job in the bank that saw his weight creep up as working all hours left him little time for cooking			1
@entity5 struggled with his weight since childhood when his mother would bring back treats from the biscuit factory where she worked and he would spend his pocket money on pick and mix at his largest @entity26 would avoid sitting in certain chairs in fear of breaking them or being unable to get back up ' we did n't have time to go shopping , so @entity30 and @entity65 takeaway menus were always on the kitchen table			1
' i 'd order an onion bhaji to start , tikka masala and a rice to myself , a large naan and poppadoms and polish the lot off			0
' in may 1997 @entity5 was made redundant from his full - time job as a bank manager and but his old habits continued and by 2003 , his size made it too difficult to work			1
in 2006 for their 25th wedding anniversary , the couple had booked a celebratory holiday to @entity81			2
but they were unable to travel because of his size			0
both @entity5 and his wife @entity8 piled on the pounds after their jobs kept them too busy to cook so they would order @entity65 or @entity30 takeaways most nights of the week the pair decided to make a change after staying with @entity5 's sister @entity91 who was having success with @entity19 world and have lost a combined weight of 29st since 2012 @entity8 said : ' we were looking forward to spending a week in the sun and i 'd bought new holiday outfits			1
i was ticking the days off , could n't wait to spend some quality time together			0
' but a month before , @entity5 was struck down with cellulitis and leg ulcers , so painful he was hospitalised and we had to cancel the holiday			1
' @entity5 was so apologetic , i know he felt guilty , but i did n't care			1
i just wanted him to get better			0
we ended up celebrating with a big party instead			0
' @entity8 admits that even when they did manage to go on holiday @entity5 's weight proved to be a huge problem			1
as he gained more weight @entity5 developed health complications including type - two diabetes ' even when we did fly over the years , @entity5 would n't get out of his seat , ' she admitted			1
' he was so scared he might not fit back in			0
he could n't go to the toilet , because the loo cubicle is so small on a plane			0
' the pair did occasionally attempt to shed a few pounds but it never worked out			2
' we 'd lose a few pounds then treat ourselves with chocolate , ' @entity8 said			2
' sometimes we 'd go shopping together and i 'd have to drop him at the front of the supermarket then go and park			0
otherwise he could n't walk all that way			0
' @entity8 says that eventually @entity5 's weight prevented him from enjoying social situations			1
' it got to a point where @entity26 hated going out , the staring really upset him			0
' i would confront strangers about it , asking if they thought they knew us or if they had a problem			0
' no - one ever said anything rude but i know it really got @entity5 down			1
' @entity8 successfully lost 8st but says she could n't keep up with @entity5 's phenomenal efforts as well as affecting his appearance @entity5 's weight became more and more of a danger to his health			1
@entity8 continued : ' getting so big meant he developed type - two diabetes and he was taking a cocktail of 15 different tablets and an injection for it every day			1
' i was concerned but i just had to be supportive for him , i could n't control what he was eating			0
' @entity5 became more aware of his size and it got to the point where he would deliberately avoid certain situations			2
@entity8 said : ' he would n't sit on our friend 's garden furniture in case he broke it			2
he was petrified of breaking other people 's property			0
he 's so tall as well			0
' it was like a giant trying to sit down			0
' we could n't go into coffee shops because he could n't fit into the chairs with arms			0
' we would n't go to the cinema in case the chairs were n't wide enough			0
@entity5 was so scared he might get stuck			2
aged 45 , @entity5 reached his heaviest weighing 38st and @entity8 became increasingly concerned for her husband			1
' he was so depressed and withdrawn , we did talk about his weight but we never spoke about how serious it was			0
' i knew @entity5 could die if we did n't do something but that part was unspoken between the two of us			2
' but @entity5 was n't the only one who struggled with his weight			1
@entity8 had also piled on the pounds after she left her high - energy job as a chef			1
she said : ' i 'd always been running around in a boiling kitchen and it was hard work			0
i ate healthily then , tucking into proper meals on my lunch and at the end of the day			0
' but once i started an office job sat at my desk all day , and eating cakes people brought in , my clothes were getting tighter			0
' the turning point came for the pair after staying with @entity5 's sister @entity91 who was having success with the @entity19 diet , they both decided to sign up in april 2012			1
as well as changing his diet @entity5 took up @entity4 too which he grew to love			1
three years on and @entity5 has lost 21st and @entity8 says he is a changed man inside and out			1
' i 've got the man i married back , he 's so confident			0
he 's a completely different person than i 've known over the last ten years			0
' and he loves being around the ladies at @entity4 , he 's a bit of a charmer			2
it does n't phase him being the only bloke there			0
' the pair booked a trip to @entity81 for their 25th wedding anniversary but had to cancel because of @entity5 's size after seeing @entity5 's success @entity8 decided to take up @entity4 too but says she was no match for her light - footed husband			1
' by january 2013 , i could n't keep up with him			0
@entity5 had lost eight stone so we both joined @entity4 classes but i have two left feet			1
i was stumbling everywhere but @entity5 had a whale of a time			2
' @entity5 has continued his @entity4 classes to insure he does n't slip back into his old ways			1
he said : ' once a week i go off with other women , but @entity8 does n't mind			2
doing @entity4 helps to keep the weight off and i ca n't believe how light on my feet i am now			1
' @entity8 has also had success with @entity19			2
by june 2013 , she had reached her target weight of 10st			2
