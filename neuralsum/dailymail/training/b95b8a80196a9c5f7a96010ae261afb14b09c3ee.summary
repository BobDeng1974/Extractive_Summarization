by @entity0 wild bison became extinct across the forests and plains of @entity4 100 years ago			1
but now seven bison raised in captivity in @entity7 are about to run free in a forest in @entity9 in a coordinated reintroduction project for the species			1
the animals arrived at @entity13 in @entity9 four days ago and will spend the next few weeks in a large enclosure to get used to their surroundings before making their bid for freedom			1
the herd are pictured in their new home the @entity4 bison , eurasian beaver and white - tailed eagle are among the animals that have made a remarkable comeback in @entity4 over the past 50 years , zoologists said			1
a total of 27 mammal and bird species recovered over the past 50 years thanks to legislative measures and conservation efforts , according to a report released in september 2013			0
scientists from the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , @entity44 and the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) worked with experts from across @entity4 to gather relevant data about the distribution and abundance of selected species			0
the @entity4 bison , which is the largest herbivore in @entity4 , became extinct in the early 20th century due to severe hunting pressure and habitat loss			2
however , a large - scale breeding and reintroduction programme based on individuals remaining in captivity has led to wild populations being re-established in areas of central and eastern @entity4			2
one of the creatures set to wander the forest is a female @entity4 bison born and raised at @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 , according to the @entity65 ( @entity65 )			1
she is called @entity67 and is named after the picturesque @entity62 glen on the @entity69			2
she joins six other female bison from three other @entity7 and @entity72 herds at the @entity74 's @entity73 in @entity75			0
‘ @entity67 and the other bison will join an already established herd in @entity13 , @entity9 , to help augment both numbers and genetic diversity within the group , ' said @entity81 , head of living collections for @entity62			1
‘ as the breeding programme coordinator for @entity4 bison , my main tasks are to ensure that the captive programme remains robust and that animals are made available for projects like this and as such i worked with the @entity74 to select animals from breeders of @entity4 bison within the @entity7 and @entity72 to support this reintroduction project			1
’ saved from extinction : in 1927 the @entity4 bison ( pictured ) became extinct in the wild but a number were kept in zoos			2
a coordinated approach to their management was started in 1932 , with the first captive - bred bison reintroduced back into the wild in 1952 @entity67 was born at the park on 21 july 2012 to a male called @entity106 and a female named @entity108			1
she , along with the other females born between 2010 and 2012 were selected to be part of this reintroduction due to their genetic background and to increase the number of females within @entity13			2
@entity116 of @entity117 which led the translocation of the bison , said : ' many people forget that extinction of species is not simply a problem in @entity124 and @entity125			0
it is happening here on our doorsteps in @entity4 too			0
' that ’s why @entity74 was delighted to be able to asked to use our expertise in relocating animals to lead the translocation of these bison to @entity9			0
' @entity134 underwent a series of medical checks earlier in the year to ensure she was healthy before being sent to her new home			0

reintroductions continue and in 2012 , the total wild population had risen to over 3,000			0
the @entity62 is currently home to 17 @entity4 bison , including 15 females and two males and all of the creatures that have been born on site are named after @entity64 glens .			1

a @entity4 bison named @entity67 is set to wander the forest and was born and raised at @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64
she and the others will join an established herd to boost numbers and the genetic diversity of the group
