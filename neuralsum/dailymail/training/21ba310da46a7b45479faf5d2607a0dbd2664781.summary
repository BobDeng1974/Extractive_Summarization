by @entity0 gorillas use their smell as a form of communication to other gorillas , researchers have found			0

gorillas at @entity18 : researchers say the animals use the unusual form of communication in thick @entity11 forests , where other methods are tough			1
researchers spent 12 months following a wild male silverback gorilla in the @entity11 rainforest as the ape tended to his harem and fended off competitors			2
the gorilla , whom they named @entity31 , was a dominant male whose babies had a high survival rate scientists analyzed odor strength in relation to arousal levels in the silverback			1
scientists determined the factors that predicted extreme levels of odor emission from the silverback			0
according to the results , the male silverback may use odor as a modifiable form of social communication , where context - specific chemical - signals may moderate the social behaviors of other gorillas			1

researchers spent 12 months following a wild male silverback gorilla in the @entity11 rainforest as the ape tended to his harem and fended off competitors			2
the gorilla , whom they named @entity31 , was a dominant male whose babies had a high survival rate @entity31 broadcasted his scent when he encountered other gorillas , as if to say , ' i am strong , powerful and here , protecting my females and babies , ' researchers @entity67 told @entity76 times , when strange and potentially threatening silverbacks were near , @entity31 abruptly shut off his scent			1
" we think he was then trying not to tell the other male where and who he was , " @entity67 said			0
mammals communicate socially through visual , auditory , and chemical signals			2
the chemical sense is in fact the oldest sense , shared by all organisms including bacteria , and mounting evidence suggests that humans also participate in social chemical signaling			0
' our results suggest that silverback odor strength can be ‘ turned up ’ or ‘ turned down ’ as well as ‘ turned on ’ or ‘ turned off ’ as a function of the context and relationship between the emitter and perceiver , and that varying odor intensities may communicate different context specific types of information , the researchers wrote			2
however , not much is known about this type of signaling in closely related hominoids , like wild apes			0
to better understand chemical - communication in apes , scientists in this study analyzed odor strength in relation to arousal levels in a wild group of western lowland gorillas in the @entity11 , specifically focusing on the male silverback , or the mature leader of the group			1
scientists determined the factors that predicted extreme levels of odor emission from the silverback			0
they hypothesized that if gorilla scent were being used as a social signal , instead of only a sign of arousal or stress , odor emission would depend on social context and would vary depending on the gorilla 's relationship to other gorillas			0
according to the results , the male silverback may use odor as a modifiable form of social communication , where context - specific chemical - signals may moderate the social behaviors of other gorillas			1

researchers believe that the silverback , the dominant male of the group , is particularly adept at using smells to communicate			1
the authors predicted extreme silverback odor , where the odor was the only element that could be smelled in the surrounding air , by the presence and intensity of interactions between different gorilla groups such as silverback anger , distress and long - calling auditory rates , and the absence of close proximity between the silverback and the mother of the youngest infant			0
the authors suggest that odor communication between apes may be especially useful in @entity11 forests , where limited visibility may necessitate increased reliance on other @entity173 added , ' no study has yet investigated the presence and extent to which chemo – communication may moderate behaviour in non-human great apes			1
' we provide crucial ancestral links to human chemo - signaling , bridge the gap between @entity185 monkey and human chemo - communication , and offer compelling evidence that olfactory communication in hominoids is much more important than traditionally thought			0

odor communication useful in @entity11 forests with limited visibility
@entity141 , the dominant male of the group , is particularly adept at using smells to communicate with others
