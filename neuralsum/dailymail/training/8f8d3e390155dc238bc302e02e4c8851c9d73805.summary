' @entity1 is a master of mind games , and the one thing he likes to have within his group is a siege mentality			1
he has always been like that and gets his group of players behind him , and makes sure they are all pushing in the right direction , ' said @entity8			2
' when he has a press conference , he protects his players and that shows he is 100 per cent behind them and wants the players to be the same with him			0

@entity1 was also unhappy with referee @entity62 after side 's @entity18 clash against @entity19 @entity1 watches on as @entity21 stands on @entity24 early in the first half at @entity20 while @entity8 , 43 , believes the @entity9 have what it takes to see off a @entity58 side beaten at home by @entity70 in their last league match , he warned against any complacency over what the run - in could yet bring			1
' it will be a tough game , but on the back of a great win in midweek , i would fancy @entity2 to get the result against @entity58 , ' said @entity8 , who played more than 160 games for @entity2 between 1990 and 1998			1
' as for the title , @entity58 have already pegged back a nine - point lead earlier in the season , so all it takes is for @entity2 to have another blip and all of a sudden @entity58 are back in the ball game			2
' however , if @entity2 do win on saturday , then you would not bet against them going on to win the championship with that advantage			2
' @entity2 will face @entity91 in the @entity18 final at @entity93 on march 1			0

' the priority will , of course , be to win the @entity120 and go as far as possible in the @entity121 , but for the likes of people like @entity21 , who have come to the @entity120 for the first time to play in such a big game at @entity93 will stay with him for the rest of his life			0
' @entity8 played more than 160 games for @entity2 between 1990 and 1998 one of the latest initiatives from @entity28 @entity27 will see the @entity131 pub , on @entity99 's @entity132 , be temporarily known as ' @entity133 ' from where activities will be run to help celebrate and inspire male friendships			2

you live the life of keeping fit naturally , training and playing , you kind of take it for granted , but at the same time you ca n't be aware of something that is not visible , so it is important to get the check - ups , especially if there is a history in the family			0
