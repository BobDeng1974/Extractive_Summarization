@entity0 exhibited courage beyond the call of duty in @entity3			1
the hard man from @entity5 withstood a witching hour of agony to make history against the mightiest pound - for - pound boxer in the world			2
that almost suicidal refusal to sink into purgatory was not enough for @entity0 to finally win his world middleweight championship at his third time of trying			2
that persistence under crucifying fire – a mentality beyond the comprehension of most who never venture onto that roped scaffold – could not quite carry him to the honour of going the 12 - round distance			0
the bloodied face of @entity0 contorts as @entity24 connects with another barrage of brutal punches to rock the @entity27 the relentless @entity24 did not give @entity0 a moment 's respite and was forever on the front foot , landing blow after savage blow @entity24 knocked @entity0 down to the canvas several times in the fight , but the @entity5 man showed tremendous bravery to keep going the baby - faced fighter from @entity40 made it 32 wins from 32 fights with another dazzling display to showcase his incredible talents @entity0 is forced back on to the ropes as @entity24 unleashes another savage right - hander to rock the @entity5 fighter back on his heels @entity0 cowers in the corner as @entity24 unleashes an unstoppable barrage of punches in the 11th to put @entity0 on the back foot referee @entity55 darts between the two fighters to put a merciful end to @entity0 's bravery with @entity24 keeping his 100 per cent record @entity55 puts his arm around @entity0 as the bloodied @entity27 reflects on a brave performance in the @entity62 but it did give our reformed ex-prisoner the distinction of taking @entity24 the furthest he has ever been in his 32 fights of terrifying destructive power , to the agony of the 11th			1
the @entity40 wrecking ball had not been past eight rounds in 18 fights in the past six years and only once as far as the tenth in this entire career which now contains 29 knock - outs , the highest stoppage percentage in the annals of the classic middleweight division			2
for that mr @entity0 was applauded from the ring within an opulent ballroom in this @entity81 for grown ups – and deserves a hero ’s welcome when he arrives home in @entity86			2
it is not always about winning			0
@entity0 , having turned his life around , found even more dignity , admiration and , most importantly of all , self respect by his valour			2
i could give him no better than a share of one round			0
he was battered to the canvas for the first time in his career			0
the last time , from a right hand blow like a bazooka , sank him into a tortured crouch and enabled referee @entity103 to enact a merciful , rightful stoppage			0
@entity0 had not just come to survive			2
he fought back whenever he could , often enough for @entity24 has a chin which would probably withstand even his own murderous punchee			2
but every time he did hit out he was brutally punished for his temerity by not only the power but also the ring mastery of one of probably the next greatest pound - for - pound boxer on the planet			0
the nervous wait for @entity0 finally ended as he entered this bizarre venue at three minutes to midnight			2
@entity24 made his ring walk precisely at the witching hour			2
they like a late night in @entity119			0
it was well into sunday by the time the national anthems , the formalities and announcer @entity124 ’s call to @entity125 gave way to the first bell			0
once the opening bell rang @entity24 went to work with his left jab but @entity0 was unabashed and landed a couple of rangy right counters			1
a combination from @entity0 stung the @entity40 into action and the first volley of his power punches sent the @entity135 on to the retreat			0
@entity24 connects with a brutal right jab as @entity0 feels the force of the unbeaten @entity40 fighter in @entity3 @entity0 was sent to the canvas three times by a rampant @entity24 but showed guts galore to take the fight into the 11th round @entity24 grins after another victory for the enormously impressive 32 - year - old , who successfully defended his middleweight title once more @entity24 is embraced in the ring after another dominant display from arguably the best pound - for - pound fighter on the planet @entity24 is hoisted aloft by a member of his team after demonstrating exactly why he is one of the most feared fighters on the planet in round two , the brave @entity27 had the advantages of height , weight and reach but @entity24 ’s speed was the problem and referee @entity55 warned @entity0 for holding			1
@entity0 had come to fight but was rocked by a right left combination but kept doing enough in adversity to steal a share of the round			1
@entity24 showed all of his power in the third , after @entity0 ’s one - twos were again in evidence at the start of the round			1
but he was rocked by lefts and rights to the head and body and did well to stave off being knocked down for the first time in his 31 fight career when @entity24 opened up in the final minute			1
with the heat well and truly on , not for the first time @entity0 was warned for hitting low in desperation , that first visit to the canvas was not long delayed			1
a wicked , trademark body shot sat him down			0
no sooner did he rise than @entity185 unleashed a vicious combination which dropped him again			0
it was an act of courage for @entity0 to make it to the bell			0
@entity24 took a comparative breather in the fifth , and @entity0 was able to throw some punches of his own but the @entity86 complexion was reddening badly			1
@entity0 's only hope appeared to be that the champion would punch himself out			1
@entity0 ’s courage was remarkable as the fight headed into the sixth , but he was taking a beating now			1
three uppercuts in succession left him spitting blood and he sank painfully onto his stool in the corner at the end of the round			1
@entity208 claps as @entity24 clutches his middleweight belts after a convincing display to stop @entity0 in the 11th the @entity3 crowd were treated to a fight of blood and guts from @entity0 and unstoppable power and precision from @entity24 a show of defiance from @entity0 gave him the satisfaction of landing a couple of combinations in the seventh , but he was being stalked and after more heavy blows from @entity24 had to cling to the @entity40 's waist to stay upright under heavy fire in the closing seconds			1
@entity0 ’s resolve was heroic			0
many a good man would have had enough by the end of the fourth but here he was still trying to fire back four rounds later			1
at times only his strength kept him up and when he did sink to his knees the referee gave him the benefit of a slip			0
there was more hell to come and it looked as if only the bell prevented mr @entity103 from calling a halt to proceedings			0
under the open scoring system the announcer revealed that @entity24 was holding a huge lead at the start of the ninth			0
just as predictably the hole for @entity0 deepened but he kept taking the punishment and swinging in hope			0
somehow @entity0 had become the second man to take @entity24 to the tenth in his career			1
again he called on his phenomenal reserves of strength come out fighting			0
@entity258 punished his affrontery with an assault verging on slaughter and a massive right dropped @entity0 for the third time			1
again the bell came to the rescue			0
@entity0 came back out to make his little piece of 11th round history – but there was to be no survival to the final bell			1
another near - decapitating right sank him to a seated position on the ropes and more blows rained mr @entity55 – mercifully and rightly – hurried to call the stoppage .			1

@entity0 and @entity24 shared two even opening rounds in @entity3
@entity24 connected with a powerful *straight* right jab at the end of the third to leave @entity0 shaken
a further barrage in the fourth left the brave @entity27 rocked and on the canvas twice
with @entity0 's face bloodied , the @entity5 fighter showed guts to take the fight to the 11th round
but another brutal assault from @entity24 saw referee @entity55 call the fight off
@entity24 maintains his 100 per cent record , winning all of his 32 fights
