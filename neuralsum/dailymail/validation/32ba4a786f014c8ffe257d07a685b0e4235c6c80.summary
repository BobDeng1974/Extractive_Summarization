an obese mother starved to death after being left unable to keep food down by gastric weight - loss surgery			1
@entity4 from @entity5 underwent a gastric bypass in 2010 at @entity7 after ballooning to 26 stone			1
the mother of two had been suffering arthritis and struggled to exercise for much of her life			2
but within days of the operation the 42 - year - old showed signs of complications , struggling to keep food down despite being given anti-nausea pills			1
over the following years she was rushed in and out of hospital , with doctors forced to insert feeding tubes to keep her alive			1
@entity4 died after undergoing gastric bypass surgery			1
the 42 - year - old dropped from 24 stone ( left ) to just four in as many @entity24 died in march 2014 a few months after being photographed ( right ) in march 2014 , weighing 20 stone less than when she underwent the surgery , the mother of two died			1
her daughter @entity28 has since told of how she wished her mother had never had the operation at all			1
' i ’ll never be able to forget the horror of how mum died			2
she thought the gastric bypass would be the start of a new life when she ’d finally have the slim figure she always dreamed of , ' she said			1
' yet by the end she was so thin , just a living skeleton confined to a wheelchair			0
' she just faded away in front of my eyes			0
i wo n’t ever get over it			0
' ' i speak on behalf of the whole family when i say people often mistakenly think these operations are the answer to being obese			2
' but the truth is we believe my mum would still be alive if she had n’t had this done			0
' mrs @entity4 , a former carer , struggled with her weight after being unable to exercise for much of her life , her daughter added			1
the mother of two with daughters @entity60 ( left ) and @entity61 ( right )			2
the women begged their mother not to undergo the surgery but had their fears dismissed when she believed doctors ' advice , they said mrs @entity4 struggled with her weight for most of her life after being born with hip problems which made it difficult for her to exercise ' @entity72 had always been overweight			1
she was born with a hip problems and developed arthritis that made exercise difficult			0
' despite ' adoring ' @entity76 takeaways the mother of two made several attempts to lose weight			1
' she tried every diet going but she just simply could n't maintain her weight loss and whenever she lost a stone she ‘ d put it all back on again and more			1
aged 37 , her weight peaked at 26 stone			1
at just 4ft 9in , this gave mrs @entity4 a @entity88 of 79 , 49 points above the official classification for someone who is obese			1
the 42 - year - old was in and out of hospital for three after having the operation			1
above , she is at a healthy weight despite complications after having treatment for a range of weight - related problems , doctors urged the woman to consider more drastic action			1
' the doctors were blunt			2
in hindsight they frightened her into wanting the surgery , ' said @entity28 , 19			2
' they said she would die without an operation			0
at the same time ( my sister ) @entity60 and i were growing up and she longed to be slim and buy normal clothes			0
' she was fed up of ordering outsize stuff and dreamed of accompanying us on clothes shopping trips			0
' @entity28 and her sister begged their mother to avoid the surgery but say they were dismissed because she trusted doctors advice			1
after dropping two stone naturally , mrs @entity4 underwent the procedure in hospital in 2010			1
despite being unable to keep food down afterwards , doctors insisted she would recover , and sent her home			1
yet despite being prescribed anti nausea drugs , the sickness continued			0
' all her food had to be liquidised because she could n't swallow any lumps at all			0
it was heartbreaking to see her having to drink her meals			0
even then , often she still could n’t keep anything down			0
' within three months her weight had dropped to 18 stone			1
' @entity72 was delighted about the weight loss but doctors were worried she was losing too much weight too fast			1
' over the next six months mrs @entity4 became gradually thinner , encountering a range of ailments including pancreatitis along the way			2
in march 2011 , a year after the operation , she was rushed to hospital weighing just four stone - an astonishing 20 stone less than the previous year			1
there a feeding tube was directly inserted through her side into her stomach while doctors urgently tried to reverse some of the gastric bypass to allow @entity4 to eat more			1
' she was in hospital for two months and when she came home it was terrible as not only could she still only eat liquidised food , she had to go through the indignity of being fed via a tube into her stomach every day , ' said @entity28			0
' being fed through her stomach took ten hours of being hooked up to a machine – it was no life at all			0
' the stress of her health problems put pressure on her marriage to @entity28 's father , @entity165 , and he later left the family home			0
' i would sit there begging mum to eat			0
in desperation i ’d even try spoon - feeding her like a baby			0
' but by now because every time she ate , she ’d be sick , she ’d developed a fear of food			0
she ’d cry and in tears say she just could n’t manage it			0
the 42 - year - old became too frail to eat her own food and eventually contracted pneumonia			1
she is pictured at her daughter 's wedding ( top left ) and in her home ( right ) in some of the last photographs taken of her ' it broke our hearts			0
' in november that year , after being rushed to hospital having collapsed , mrs @entity4 was told her organs were shutting down			1
she returned home two weeks later but was in and out of hospital over the next two years			0
in march 2014 @entity61 woke up to find her mother had passed out on the sofa			2
she was rushed to hospital where doctors managed to revive her			0
over 6,500 weight loss procedures are currently performed in the @entity197 every year with gastric bypass one of the most common operations			1
this number is set to increase with the @entity201 and care excellent ( @entity202 ) recommending the @entity203 should offer even more weight loss surgery to thousands more people to tackle the growing obesity epidemic			2
it works by inserting a small pouch at the top of the stomach			0
this is then connected to a section of the small intestine , bypassing the rest of the stomach and bowel			0
this means that it will take less food to make you feel full			0
gastric bypass surgery is often favoured over gastric band surgery by doctors			1
this is because unlike a band – which temporarily makes the stomach smaller and can be removed - it is permanent			0
the patient and gives better weight loss results for the very obese			0
but devastatingly , three days later she died			2
a post mortem found @entity4 ’s problems began when she had the bypass			1
' a lack of food led to her losing too much weight and her body not being fed vital nutrients , ' said @entity28			2
' she was so frail she could n't fight off any infection and finally died from pneumonia she 'd picked up during a hospital stay			2
' the gastric bypass starved her to death			1
she was skin and bone when she went			0
' the young mother , who welcomed baby @entity246 seven months ago , said doctors did not properly warn her mother of the risks involved			2
' doctors presented this operation to mum as the answer to all her problems			2
if mum had been told all of the risks she never would have agreed to go ahead			0
' we do n’t feel the risk of severe side effects , which can be fatal , were ever properly explained to mum			0
' we bitterly regret my mum ever allowed doctors to persuade her having weight loss surgery was the answer to her obesity problem			1
' ' i only hope telling mum ’s tragic story makes anyone else think twice before having gastric surgery			2
' if it stops just one person going through the same nightmare , it will be worth it			0
