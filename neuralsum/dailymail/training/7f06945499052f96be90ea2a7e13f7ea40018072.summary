@entity0 has taken to @entity1 to prove that he is on the road to recovery as the @entity5 striker trains in @entity6 in a bid to recover from a thigh injury			1
the 25 - year - old has been sent to the @entity10 to continue his rehabilitation from the injury which has sidelined him for most of the season			2
@entity0 posted a picture of himself while travelling along with lyrics from @entity17 singer @entity15 '			2
@entity0 took to @entity1 to tell fans he will be back ' stronger and better than ever ' the @entity5 striker posted pictures of himself in the gym going through various drills including kettle bell lifts ( right ) and balancing on a vibrating @entity24 the @entity25 forward tests his balance and strenghtens his leg muscles using a vibrating @entity24 @entity0 is joined by a personal trainer as the former @entity30 man goes through a stretching exercise @entity0 also spent time strengthening his legs using kettle bells while in the @entity6 gym ankle ligaments - @entity37 v @entity36 may 2013 , returned for pre-season			1

he wrote : ' do n't worry bout me			0
. people do n't count me out cause i got people counting on me			0
' working hard every day to get back fit ... jus know ...			0
i 'll be back stronger and better than ever ! ! ' @entity0 also showed off his work in the gym , posting three different images which shows the striker balancing on a vibrating @entity24 and lifting kettle bells			1
the @entity37 forward has not played for the club since august 31 after he initially strained a thigh on international duty			1
on the eve of his comeback he pulled a calf muscle in his first full training session back with the first team and just when he appeared to have got over that he sustained another , different , thigh injury which has ruled him out until the new year			1
@entity5 manager @entity65 said last month that the club may have to look even deeper into the root of @entity0 's problems - this is the ninth separate but similar injury has had in his career , with the player suggesting the issue may be hereditary as his father , a trainee at @entity75 , and two uncles @entity77 and @entity78 - both professional footballers - also suffered the same problems			1
it is understood the striker has travelled to @entity10 to undergo warm - weather training and rehabilitation to help with his recovery for a fortnight			1
he has not gone to the @entity10 to have any medical treatment or procedure			0
25 - year - old @entity0 has not played for @entity5 since august and will be out until next year the striker first injured his thigh while on international duty with @entity37 earlier this season @entity0 scores for @entity5 during their 2 - 1 victory over @entity93 on the first day of the season ' he has gone away to get some specific work in with some of our staff and he is coming along well , ' said @entity65			1
@entity0 's absence has been compounded by the failure of £ 16million summer signing @entity100 to pick up the slack having yet to score a @entity104 goal			2
he too came back injured from the last international break and has not been available since because of a groin problem , forcing @entity65 to pick @entity107 who has responded with two goals in his first two matches leading the line and has put in good performances in the two games since then			2
with @entity100 facing a possible @entity114 charge for posting an apparently anti-semetic and racist graphic on social media - for which he has until 6pm on friday to give his explanation to the @entity114 - the spotlight has only intensified on the troubled @entity120 international			2
@entity65 insists , however , that until the 24 - year - old is available to play he can not waste much time thinking about him			0
@entity100 has struggled to make an impact since his £ 16million move from @entity126 ' he is a very much a @entity5 player but he is injured at the moment and there is not much more to add from me , ' he said			1
' he is not fit to play , my concentration at this moment is on players who are fit and available to play and that is my only thinking at the moment			0
' he is working with the medical team on a daily basis and i trust the team of people here to look after injuries			0
' at this moment in time the team is doing well and whenever he is back fit then we will see where he is at			0
' hopefully he will be available sooner rather than later			0
' @entity100 , laughing in the stands , has struggled to fill the void left by @entity0 's injury @entity145 celebrates scoring against @entity146 during @entity5 's 2 - 1 win on tuesday while the debate continues over @entity145 's future in light of the club 's contract offer , which he has not yet accepted , @entity65 has to concern himself with the more immediate issue associated with the midfielder			1
having previously admitted the 34 - year - old can not play three matches in a week , effectively the @entity158 boss has to decide whether to retain his captain in the starting line - up to face @entity161 on saturday or hold him back for tuesday 's must - win @entity163 tie at home to @entity166 , which is followed by a trip to @entity168 the following sunday			0
' the only focus is our next game but of course you are having to plan forward and look at one or two teams down the line , ' said @entity65 , who this week had to quash reports there had been a disagreement between him and @entity145			0
' if you rest someone they are rotated , if they are rotated they are dropped , if he is dropped he is left out so you ca n't win as a manager			0
' i 'll always pick a team which i think can win the game			0
