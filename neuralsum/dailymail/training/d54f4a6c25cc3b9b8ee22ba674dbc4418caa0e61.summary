as the 100,000th car rolled past his tollbooth this week , @entity0 probably allowed himself a moment of quiet satisfaction			2
it meant that a rather audacious gamble – using his life savings to set up a private road – was well on its way to paying off			0
mr @entity0 built the 400 - yard track through a field in order to spare drivers months of misery while a council repairs a busy commuter route			1
his toll road cost £ 150,000 to build , with running costs of £ 150,000 , so he is now two - thirds of the way to breaking even			1
it was built without planning permission , but a retrospective application , which cost £ 25,000 in surveyors ’ fees and ecological reports , is due to be assessed soon			0
it has so captured the public imagination that it has become something of a tourist attraction			0
but its main success has been helping drivers as the @entity20 between @entity51 and @entity52 is fixed after a landslip in february			1
@entity55 council aims to reopen the road by @entity57 , and recently spent £ 660,000 to fast - track the repairs – taking the cost to £ 2.66million			1
mr @entity0 , 62 , believes they could be complete by mid-november			2
as part of the planing application , his road must then be dismantled			0
the businessman was initially concerned he would be left out of pocket if he did not make £ 300,000 by the end of the year the father - of - four , who came up with the idea while in his local pub , sought to recoup the £ 300,000 cost of building and upkeeping the road by charging £ 2 per car and £ 3 per caravan and trailer but he is feeling fairly confident of recouping his money			1
‘ it is very much a race against time , ’ he said			0
‘ but we estimate this could be achieved by the beginning of november			0
‘ i ’m absolutely delighted and overwhelmed by the support			0
i want to thank each and every person who has used the toll road			2
‘ it really does do what it says on the can – saves people stress , time and driving on the diversion			0
’ father - of - four mr @entity0 and his wife @entity92 , 52 , who run party shops in @entity51 , faced having to sell their cottage if the toll road flopped			1
the hilly field is usually home to herds of cows , flocks of sheep or crops but is now occupied by the temporary road - which mr @entity0 says has attracted motorists from all over the world mr @entity0 says he has already raised two thirds of the amount required and believes he will be able to cover all his costs by early november @entity110 closed : the suggested route after the closure of the @entity20 was the @entity113 , which took in a 14 - mile detour the father - of - four came up with the idea after a section of the @entity110 near @entity51 was closed following a landslide , sparking a 14 - mile detour ( pictured ) this aerial view showing the @entity121 road on the left and the main road on the right			1
the toll road is the first privately owned to open for more than 100 years			2

@entity0 , 62 , opened a 400 - yard toll road in @entity24 , @entity19 in *august*
he had faced a 14 - mile detour after the closure of a busy commuter route
@entity133 between @entity51 and @entity52 had been shut in february due to landslip
mr @entity0 spent £ 150,000 building road and another £ 150,000 on its upkeep
he was concerned he would be left out of pocket if he did *n't* make £ 300,000
but he has already raised two - thirds of the money , by charging £ 2 per car
