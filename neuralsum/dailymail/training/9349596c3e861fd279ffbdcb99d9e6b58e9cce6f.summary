according to the book , as reported by @entity34 , president @entity1 called @entity5 three times during one day to speak about his latest offer for the deal			1
but the @entity5 did not return the phone call for most of the day - described in the book by @entity12 as a ' monumental communications lapse ' between the two men			1
when the call was finally returned from @entity5 , he called off the entire deal after the @entity5 felt he could not come to an agreement with the president			2
this created a furious reaction from the normally relaxed @entity1			2
one member of staff in the room at the time said @entity1 gripped the phone so tight he thought it would break			1
speaking to @entity12 , @entity5 said : ' he was spewing coals			2
he was n't going to get a damn dime more out of me			1

the pair held the meetings at the @entity6 in the hope of creating a ' big deal '			0
however , as the book revealed , the deal between the two men broke down and their relationship soured			0

@entity1 's battle with @entity67 over fiscal policy dominated the agenda in the @entity6 for much of 2011 and is still unresolved			1

president @entity1 and his staff believe @entity5 pulled back from the agreement because of political pressure from the @entity67 , saying he took the president 's proposal as an excuse to pull out of the talks			1

it started with a golf summit and continued with detailed conversations on the @entity141 balcony and patio outside the @entity143			0
@entity144 reports that @entity5 would drink red wine and smoke cigarettes while the president drank iced tea and - having quite smoking - chewed on @entity149			2
