by @entity0 published : 18:30 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 18:53 est , 30 april 2012 the prime minister ’s anti-poverty tsar has accused @entity3 of wasting the first half of his term in government by ignoring a study into how to smash the cycle of deprivation			1
@entity10 said mr @entity3 had squandered two years by failing to implement any of his suggestions			1
the former welfare minister said the prime minister ‘ has yet to show he has even read ’ the study he commissioned into bridging the class divide for youngsters			1
pleading poverty : former welfare minister @entity10 ( left ) said @entity3 ( right ) had ' missed an opportunity ' the maverick @entity20 mp called for a dedicated cabinet minister to take charge of all policy for the under - fives , saying so far the coalition had failed			1
the government ’s dithering had led to a ‘ lost opportunity ’ to ensure that children from low income families did not go on to fail at school			2
mr @entity10 ’s ground - breaking study , commissioned by mr @entity3 , warned that children ’s life chances were almost entirely determined before they even got to school			1
his report called for health visitors to measure children ’s behaviour and communication skills from the age of two to catch youngsters who were falling behind in their development			2
the mp for @entity45 also called for parenting classes to be offered in @entity47 far , however , his suggestions had only been taken seriously by a few keen civil servants , he said			1
mr @entity10 told the @entity50 : ‘ this is a missed opportunity			2
i am puzzled as to why the prime minister would be so anxious for me to do all this work when he has yet to show that he has read it			1
living on the breadline : the government 's dithering had led to a ' lost opportunity ' to ensure that children from low income families did not go on to fail at school ‘ @entity60 is running out , we are coming up to halfway in this parliament			2
‘ if the prime minister had hit the ground running from day one two years ago , they [ the coalition ] could have said , ‘ we may have made a mess of things in these other areas but at least we are trying really hard on this ’			1
‘ he added : ‘ this report was about giving the prime minister a flagship policy which would have taken politics into a new era			1
he needs to get on with it			0
‘ it would have raised voters ’ morale , so they could have felt that despite all this mess , we know they are sorting out life chances and they are on the right track			0
@entity85 dismissed the criticism , saying the prime minister took tackling poverty very seriously			1
a source close to mr @entity3 said : ‘ of course the prime minister is committed to trying to reduce poverty			1
@entity91 was about taking many of the poorest people out of tax altogether			0
a lot of the @entity96 will also be focused on the family			0
’ ' @entity60 is running out , we are coming up to halfway in this parliament ' mr @entity10 ’s paper ‘ @entity105 : preventing poor children becoming poor adults ’ revealed that many children begin school without knowing their first name because their parents barely speak to them			0
one of his most damning findings was that youngsters who were behind when they started school never caught up to their peers			0
he blamed the situation on the low aspirations of parents trapped in poverty where no one in the family has worked for generations			0
these parents do not bother to play with , talk to or read to their children			0
education experts also blamed the arrival of the internet which they say has contributed to a fall in verbal communication in many households			0
the government is expected to miss its target , of ensuring that no more than 1.7 million children live in poverty			0
this is despite successive governments spending £ 150 billion on tackling poverty since 1997			0
child poverty is also measured against median earnings and the recession should have made the problem easier to mask , mr @entity10 said			0
the former minister argued for poverty to be measured against other indicators such as parenting and the quality of childcare rather than just income			2
he said that the @entity20 policy of ‘ income transfers on a massive scale did not work ’			1
when his report was published in december 2010 , it was welcomed by the prime minister and deputy prime minister @entity151 as a ‘ hugely valuable contribution ’ to the coalition government ’s drive to end child poverty by 2020 .			2
