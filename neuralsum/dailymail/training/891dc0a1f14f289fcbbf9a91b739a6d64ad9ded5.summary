by @entity1 reporter as @entity2 leaves his ' bridge-gate ' troubles behind and flies to @entity4 to campaign for a fellow @entity5 , a @entity7 mayor has made more damning accusations against the governor			0
@entity11 mayor @entity10 has claimed @entity13 relief aid was withheld from her city in an attempt to push through a redevelopment backed by the @entity7 governor			1
ms @entity10 alleged that two of @entity2 's aides - lieutenant governor @entity19 and community affairs commissioner @entity18 - leaned on her to gain support for a lucrative deal			1
cut off : @entity11 mayor @entity10 claims @entity13 relief money was withheld to try to force her to approve a lucrative redevelopment deal tough week : governor @entity2 gives the state address on january 14 , as his administration is hit by accusations over ' bridge-gate ' ' the bottom line is , it ’s not fair for the governor to hold @entity13 funds hostage for the @entity33 of @entity11 because he wants me to give back to one private developer , ' she told @entity36			1
@entity13 devastated nearly 80 per cent of the @entity11 community in 2012 , and @entity2 had immediately promised its residents that he would ' be here to help '			2
but when ms @entity10 requested $ 127 million in relief aid , she was given just $ 142,000 to cover the cost of a back up generator , and $ 200,000 in recovery grants from a $ 1.8 million fund , @entity36 reported			1
in a letter written to @entity2 about the low funds , ms @entity10 wrote : ' please governor , we need your help			2
i have tried to assure @entity11 residents that we would be treated fairly			0
' no response has been received from the letter , which was dated may 8 , 2013 - the same day the city 's planning board rejected a redevelopment recommendation for @entity59			0
according to emails , public records and her diary entries , ms @entity10 claims @entity2 's aides were willing to cut off constituents and use public funds to finance a study for the governor - backed plans			1
the project , a mass redevelopment proposed by the @entity72 , was already in the pipeline when ms @entity10 was elected as mayor			2
wrecked : huge parts of @entity11 were flooded when @entity13 hit in october 2012 aid : a @entity11 shop tries to run without any power after the storm in 2012 the lucrative deal in a popular commuter area would have given the developers a free rein to build what they wanted while applying for millions of dollars in subsidies			2
ms @entity10 told @entity36 she was n't against the plan , but she did want an independent study on the projected deal to take place			1
but when the study and @entity11 board rejected the need for redevelopment , much - needed @entity13 relief money was cut off , ms @entity10 claims			1
according to a diary entry from the mayor , lieutenant governor @entity19 pulled her aside during an event in @entity11 on may 13 , last year			2
the diary entry read : ' she pulls me aside with no one else around and says that i need to move forward with the @entity59 project			0
it is very important to the governor			0
' " the word is that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you			0
i know it ’s not right – these things should not be connected – but they are " , she says , and " if you tell anyone , i will deny it "			0
' then , in a diary entry for may 17 , ms @entity10 claimed as she was preparing to appear on a televised panel about the @entity13 recovery , commissioner @entity18 leaned in and told her ' everyone in the @entity120 believes you are against [ the @entity59 project ]			1
' ms @entity10 denied she was against it , but commissioner @entity18 then allegedly told her : ' if you move that forward , the money would start flowing to you			1
' claims : @entity2 with @entity126 commissioner @entity18 , who allegedly leaned on @entity10 to support a project in return for more @entity13 aid ' pressure ' : lieutenant governor @entity19 allegedly told mayor @entity10 if she did n't move forward with the project , the administration would not be able to help her spokesmen for governor @entity2 and community affairs commissioner constable have denied the allegations			1
a spokeswoman for the commissioner said : ' mayor @entity10 ’s allegation that on may 16 , 2013 , commissioner @entity18 conditioned @entity11 ’s receipt of @entity13 aid on her moving forward with a development project is categorically false			1
' the governor 's spokesman , @entity144 , released a statement that read : ' mayor @entity10 has been effusive in her public praise of the @entity148 and the assistance we ’ve provided in terms of economic development and @entity13 aid			2
' ' what or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone ’s guess			0
' a spokesman for the @entity159 said : ' we have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation			0
if it turns out to be true it would be deplorable			0
' despite the ' bridge-gate ' scandal , many @entity5 have come to governor @entity2 's defense and praised him for taking action			0
others have said the future of the man who had been tipped to be a presidential contender rests on whether his account of when he learned of the bridge scandal is found to be accurate .			0

@entity11 mayor awarded only $ *320,000* of the $ 127m she requested in *hurricane* relief funds
@entity10 claims she was told more money would come if she backed lucrative @entity59 plan
