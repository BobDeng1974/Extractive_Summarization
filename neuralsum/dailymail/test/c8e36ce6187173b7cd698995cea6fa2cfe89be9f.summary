an experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of @entity5 's , experts have revealed			1
the drug was developed by the @entity8 pharmaceutical giant @entity7 with the original aim of treating certain types of tumour , but was shelved after it proved ineffective			2
scientists at @entity14 in @entity15 in the @entity16 have revealed how the treatment , called @entity18 , restored memory in mice given alzheimer 's disease			1
an experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of @entity5 's , experts have revealed ( file picture ) the drug worked by blocking a process that breaks nerve connections in the brain used to store memory			1
researchers say the study has led to the launch of human trials to test the efficacy of the drug in @entity5 's patients			1
@entity36 , the author of the report , published in @entity38 , said : ' with this treatment , cells under bombardment by beta amyloid plaques show restored synaptic connections and reduced inflammation , and the animal ’s memory , which was lost during the course of the disease , comes back			2
the study was funded by the @entity50 which launched a programme to test failed drugs on different diseases			2
mr @entity36 and his co-author @entity55 have already started a ' multi-site clinical trial ' to determine whether the drug can also benefit @entity5 's patients			1
according to the @entity59 , there are 850,000 people with dementia in @entity8 - a figure that includes 40,000 younger people			0
the charity estimates that 60,000 deaths are attributable to dementia every year and that there will be one million people with the disease in the @entity8 by 2025			0
it reports that the financial cost of dementia to the @entity8 is £ 26billion a year			0
the @entity71 reports the charity 's head of research dr @entity74 as giving the latest treatment a cautious welcome			0
he said : ' drug development can take decades , so repurposing pre-existing drugs for dementia is a promising avenue to find new treatments as they have been shown to be safe to use in people and can lead to clinical trials sooner			0
' as we learn more about the causes of dementia , there is hope that treatments we routinely use for other diseases may also work for people with dementia			0

drug called @entity18 originally *designed* to treat certain types of tumour
