by @entity0 published : 14:00 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 05:49 est , 16 january 2014 prince @entity3 ’s daughter has had an operation to correct a severe squint			1
since she was born , lady @entity6 has suffered from esotropia - a condition which means both eyes do not look in the same direction			1
if left untreated it can cause serious vision problems			1
successful : lady @entity6 's transformation was first evident when the @entity13 and @entity14 , attended a racing event at @entity16 in december but the queen ’s ten - year - old grand - daughter is understood to have had corrective surgery on the advice of doctors – and her transformation during a recent visit to @entity16 suggested it had been a success			1
it could also be seen as she accompanied her parents , @entity3 and his wife , @entity14 , to church at @entity28 on christmas day			0
although @entity30 has declined to comment on her health , it is understood @entity6 , who in 2011 was a bridesmaid for the @entity33 and @entity34 , was first operated on when she was just a toddler			0
condition : @entity6 has suffered from esotropia since birth - a condition which turns one eye outwards as is often the case , however , it soon became clear that she would require further treatment when older			1
details of the surgery or whether it was carried out on the @entity45 or privately , have not been released			0
but in most cases a paediatric ophthalmologist would carefully move the position of the muscles on the eye in order to make it easier to control			2
@entity6 , who is tenth in line to the throne , was a much longed - for child for @entity3 and @entity14 , who suffered the heartbreak of an ectopic pregnancy two years before she was conceived			2
she was born four weeks prematurely in an emergency caesarean operation during which @entity14 's life was in peril			1
she lost nine pints of blood through internal bleeding and was said to be just minutes from death			0
condition : the @entity18 's youngest granddaughter , pictured at the the royal wedding between the @entity33 and @entity34 , is believed to have been first operated on when she was just a toddler to @entity14 's distress her daughter who weighed just 4lb 9oz , had to be transferred almost immediately for specialist care at @entity70 , in @entity71 , @entity72 , while she had to remain 35 miles away in @entity73 , @entity74 , for another 16 days			1
however she has since grown up to be a happy , healthy child who attends a local day school and bears an uncanny resemblance to her grandmother , the @entity18 , at the same age			1
the two enjoy a particularly close relationship and often go riding together along the with @entity83 ’s son , @entity82 , @entity82 , who is six			2
royal family : @entity6 , who is tenth in line to the throne , was a much longed - for child for @entity3 and @entity14 the monarch is also frequent visitor to the family home , @entity89 , which is a short drive from @entity91			0
although she has pointedly refused to talk about her daughter ’s vision problems in public , it is believed that they inspired the @entity14 to become patron of the charity @entity98 and @entity99 of @entity100 ( @entity101 )			1
last year the @entity14 undertook a visit to @entity103 to publicise their work , visiting the @entity106 , where she witnessed patients undergoing sight - saving surgery			0
lady @entity6 attending a @entity109 at @entity110 , @entity28 there are six muscles that control eye movement , four that move the eye up and down and two that move it from side to side			2
all these muscles must be working in coordination in order for the brain to see a single image			0
when one or more of these muscles do not operate properly , the eyes may not be aligned , causing the condition			2
@entity127 is mostly seen in children , who develop the condition from a young age , but can also be affect adults			2
squinting or frequent rubbing of the eyes is a common side - effect			0
as the disorder progresses , the eyes will start to turn out when looking at close objects as well as those in the distance			0
if left untreated , the eye may turn out continually , having a significant impact on vision			1
around 35 % of sufferers require at least one surgery to have the condition sucessfully treated , so many people try vision therapy first			1
the surgical procedure to correction extropia is usually performed under general anesthesia and involves making a small incision in the tissue covering the eye in order to reach the muscles			0
the muscles are then repositioned in order to allow the eye to move properly			0
following surgery , glasses may be needed and , in many cases , further surgery is required later to keep the eyes straight .			0

@entity18 ’s youngest granddaughter has had operation to correct squint
since birth , she has suffered from condition which turns one eye outwards
she could have had serious vision problems in later life if left untreated
