two of @entity2 ’s most distinguished actors are set to star in a £ 6million film ‘ co-written ’ by a leading figure of the @entity6 apologist campaign group , @entity5			1
sir @entity7 and @entity8 will be working alongside an award - winning team in ‘ @entity11 ’			1
@entity13 - winning producer @entity12 is said to already be on board , and the film has commitments from @entity8 , sir @entity7 and @entity18			1
the film , which is supported by civil rights group @entity31 , is thought to have been co-written by former terror suspect and @entity5 spokesman @entity33			1
he spent two years under a control order before eventually being exonerated , and the film is believed to be loosely based on his own experiences			0
but mr @entity33 ’s involvement became an embarrassment for the movie after the unmasking of @entity42 as @entity6			1
last month @entity5 sparked outrage by defending the @entity45 - raised fanatic unmasked as the @entity47 butcher			2
the group described @entity42 as a ‘ beautiful and gentle ’ man who was driven to radicalisation by @entity51			1
promotion : the leaflet for the film showing @entity55 , @entity56 and sir @entity7 and mr @entity33 railed for eight minutes about the treatment he had received at the hands of the security services ‘ in very similar circumstances ’ to those of @entity61 , suggesting it was the @entity51 ’s actions which had led to the brutal killer ’s radicalisation			1
the former mental health nurse also claimed @entity2 security forces harassed @entity42 to the point where he had ‘ no options and position within @entity2 society anymore ’ in an official video for @entity5			1
he even went as far as suggesting an alleged assault on @entity61 by the police in 2010 could be directly linked to the beheadings			0
speaking to the @entity78 earlier this month , the 32 - year - old said : ‘ he was looking to get married , get a good job and settle down			0
‘ if that had happened , if our security forces had not had stopped him , would he be cutting off heads now ? ’ he added : ‘ we have a two year picture of a man constantly … trying to move his life forward and we see a pattern of security services stopping that			0
‘ we even see a pattern of the police pinning him up against the wall and strangling him			0
this is a chilling simile when you look at what he ended up doing to other people			0
’ @entity97 is a former terror suspect and spokesman for the group @entity5 @entity33 was in the spotlight again earlier this month when he stormed off in the middle of a live @entity103 news interview claiming a question on about his feelings on the beheadings was racist			1
now the filmmakers behind ‘ @entity11 ’ appear to be trying to distance themselves from @entity33 – perhaps fearing that the link with him could damage their chances of securing the £ 1million still required to begin production this year			2
the @entity25 has seen a document , which was presented to potential investors as recently as last summer , clearly stating that the film was ‘ co-written by @entity97 ’			2
and an invitation to a high - profile event due to be held at the @entity118 restaurant in @entity45 tonight to attract potential investors – which was sent out earlier this month – said : ‘ it was co-written by @entity33 , who was wrongly sent to @entity120 at 23			1
’ however , the next day the same invitation was sent out again – but with the line mentioning @entity97 deleted			0
the film ’s award - winning director @entity123 admitted that the invite to tonight ’s event was edited			0
he said : ‘ @entity33 generously said there was no reason for him to be mentioned			2
it was an association that was n’t helpful to the movie			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity131 ’s involvement was some five years ago where he was involved as a co-writer			0
this was before his involvement with @entity5 and the movie is not based on his life			2
‘ he has contributed to the script , absolutely , and he will still be paid for that if the film is made but it wo n’t be a significant amount of money			0
’ and @entity31 director @entity142 , who is helping to host the film ’s fundraising event tonight , admitted @entity33 had ‘ some involvement ’ in the film			1
she explained : ‘ my understanding is that @entity97 is one of a number of stories that inspired this film			0
’ however she went on to say : ‘ whatever you may think of @entity33 , he did suffer a miscarriage of justice many years ago , and there will continue to be many more miscarriages of justice if we continue down this path			2
‘ @entity160 is more powerful than anything and i really hope this is a great inspiring film exposing secret courts and secret justice			0
’ @entity33 described @entity164 executioner @entity42 as a ' beautiful man ' after his identity was revealed			1

sir @entity7 and @entity8 among stars due to work on the film
it has reportedly been co-written by @entity5 spokesman @entity33
the former terror suspect described @entity42 as ' beautiful '
actors are understood to have signed up to film before the controversy
