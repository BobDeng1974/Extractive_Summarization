published : 17:19 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 17:20 est , 13 may 2013 @entity0 may be one of the richest @entity1 , but after a string of recent real estate investment losses she might consider keeping her billions in the media business			1
the lady billionaire ’s most recent hit came as her company sold retail space that once contained her @entity9 at a loss of more than $ 1 million			1
the sale comes after the company ’s closing of the store itself , which was shuttered just after @entity0 signed off the daytime airwaves for good in 2011			0
fizzle : @entity0 knows how to make money in media , but the billionaire has taken more than one fat loss in the real estate game the space , which sat just across from the talk queen ’s @entity23 in @entity25 , cost the company $ 1.98 million , but it ultimately sold for only $ 875,000 , according to the @entity27			1
the @entity28 sold @entity0 logo - emblazoned designer wear from ‘ @entity30 ’ and gave proceeds to charity			2
the law firm that orchestrated the sale said the space is set to become a meditation center			0
this is not the first time an @entity0 - backed real estate investment brought a big loss			2
last summer , ms. @entity0 sold an eight - bedroom co-op unit in @entity25 ’s @entity43 neighbourhood for $ 2.75 million , a unit for which she paid a whopping $ 5.6 million in 2006			1
loss : around $ 3 million			1
ouch : the @entity28 in @entity25 closed after @entity0 's talk show ended in 2011			2
the space was recently sold at a $ 1 million loss to her company @entity49 : the store sat just across from @entity0 's @entity23 in @entity25			1
it will now become a meditation center @entity0 , by the way , never even moved into the place			2
these are two sharp blows to the media savvy businesswoman , ones that followed the mightiest of blows : when her much anticipated @entity61 hit airwaves to disappointing numbers			1
but since the network ’s dark first days , things have begun to look up and @entity0 may yet redeem her juggernaut status among tv types			0
repeat : the @entity9 , pictured , was just one of her real estate flops			0
she sold a @entity25 condo in july at a $ 3 million loss the @entity71 — its full name — has been gaining steam since landing an exclusive first interview with shamed cyclist @entity75			1
and @entity76 reports that @entity77 , which partnered with @entity0 on the own venture , has confidently reported that the cable network could be in the black by the end of 2013			0
@entity0 is currently the only @entity82 billionaire , with a reported worth of $ 2.8 billion			0
hope : things may be on the up for @entity0 , though			0
the own network , which tanked initially , is showing marked improvement and her partners at @entity77 say it could be in the black by the end of 2013			0

@entity90 took an even bigger loss last summer when she sold a @entity25 co-op she never even moved into for $ *3m* less than she paid in 2006
her billions also took a hit after her @entity61 *debuted* with *meager* ratings , but things look like they may be looking up for the media maven
