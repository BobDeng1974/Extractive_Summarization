@entity0 has been accused of turning a blind eye to child sex predators after it refused to sign up to an alert system that could stop paedophiles viewing vile images online			1
search engine @entity6 , which is owned by @entity8 , announced on saturday that it would automatically flash up warning messages on the screens of users who type in terms that could lead them to child abuse sites			1
the warnings , which experts say would deter half of paedophiles by reminding them that their criminal activity can be tracked , will also be used by @entity19			2
@entity0 has refused to sign up to an alert system that could stop paedophiles viewing vile images online ( file picture ) but @entity0 has infuriated child safety campaigners and experts by refusing to take part , because it believes its own methods in tackling the problem are more effective			1
earlier this year it emerged that @entity27 , who abducted and killed five - year - old @entity27 in @entity29 , collected a ‘ library ’ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on @entity0 and @entity6			1
@entity33 , who killed 12 - year - old @entity33 from @entity35 , also progressed from online child porn to murder			0
@entity8 ’s warning system on @entity6 would be activated automatically when users type in terms that could lead them to child porn			1
typing in the terms , chosen in consultation with the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) , will cause a notice to appear on screen , stating : ‘ warning ! child abuse material is illegal			0
’ it will also include a link to advice on how to seek counselling			0
experts said the warnings , known as splash pages , would deter a huge number of offenders			1
@entity56 , a leading government adviser on online child safety , said : ‘ the splash pages will not stop determined paedophiles but while they are very dangerous , they are a small number			0
@entity27 ( left ) , who abducted and killed five - year - old @entity27 in @entity29 , collected a ' library ' of sickening images by searching for simple terms on @entity0 and @entity6			1
@entity33 ( right ) , who killed 12 - year - old @entity33 from @entity35 , also progressed from online child porn to murder ‘ these messages will warn off a larger number of men who are interested in these pages and stop them in their tracks			2
‘ at the beginning an interest in these images starts off as a mild curiosity but they get drawn in and in some cases it can lead to rape and abuse			0
‘ these messages show them they are not anonymous			0
@entity83 would be put off by this			0
’ mr @entity56 said stopping these men at an early stage would also allow police to focus on more extreme offenders			0
‘ what @entity6 and @entity19 are doing is brilliant			2
if they show it can be done effectively , it will be very difficult for @entity0 to continue to refuse as well , ’ he added			2
a spokesman for the @entity92 , which works with child sex abuse victims and offenders , also said the warnings would deter many paedophiles			2
a @entity0 spokesman said it was working with experts on ways to deter offenders			1
‘ we use purpose - built technology and work with child safety organisations to find , remove and report child abuse imagery , because we never want this material to appear in our search results , ’ he added .			0

@entity6 has announced it would automatically flash up warning messages
@entity0 has refused to take part as it says is own methods are better
