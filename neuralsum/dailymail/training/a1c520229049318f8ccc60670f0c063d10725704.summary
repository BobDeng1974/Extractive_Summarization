by @entity1 reporter published : 13:46 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 02:43 est , 11 november 2013 the women at the center of a lawsuit claiming their rights to dignity and privacy were violated by a @entity9 police department have spoken of their ordeal			1
twelve victims claim they were filmed by security cameras as they stripped and , in some cases , used the toilet a at @entity16 police station after being arrested for @entity17			1
a @entity19 defense attorney , who highlighted their plight , has likened the filming of the young women to ' a peep show '			0
leading the case : @entity19 attorney @entity25 first filed a lawsuit on behalf of 11 women and one man in august			0
he has since been contacted by more than two dozen other people with similar stories @entity25 , who is representing the 12 victims in a lawsuit against the police , told @entity34 show 20/20 : ' i 've represented 1,000 people in @entity37 , and i 've never seen this			1
' after discovering that officers had been recording videos of mostly young women as they changed in police cells he contacted 11 women and a man who were alleged victims in the case in may			1
he said : ' this practice appears to be a peep show , ' and added that his clients feared the footage could go viral on the internet because the footage is a public record			1
his clients are now suing city of @entity54 , police chief @entity55 and lieutenant @entity56 for allegedly violating their fundamental rights to bodily privacy and dignity and engaging in unlawful searches and seizures of the inmates			1
some of the women at the center the case , who asked to remain anonymous , have spoken of their distress at the recordings			0
' the fear , the embarrassment , the anger of knowing that somebody has these videos ... and it 's happening to all these other women , ' @entity68 told 20/20			0
' i felt like a doll they were just dressing up and dressing down ... and i did n't have the fight in me to stand up for myself			0
' indecent : some of the videos , which were obtained by public record requests , show the women undressing ' sick ' : more than three dozen people being held in @entity54 city jail in @entity86 on @entity17 charges have complained about their treatment at the facility after discovering intimate moments , such as going to the bathroom , were being recorded by @entity93 cameras scene : the jail at the center of the action is inside this @entity98 in @entity86 although the jail has a curtained off area for inmates to change , the women were ordered to strip in holding cell that has an overhead camera above			1
after changing into jail clothes the women were returned to the cell and forced to strip again so they could put on their own clothes before being released			1
at the time , they believed the procedure of stripping in front of a camera was part of police protocol			1
since the original case was filed in august nearly 40 other women have come forward with similar stories			0
' they 're there to serve and protect and protect us , and they completely took advantage of each and every one of us , ' @entity68 said			0
@entity121 added : ' i do n't even think i really thought that that was something that was probably an ongoing recording , and , again , you 're just - you know , kind of assume that that 's just what is normal			1
' another of the alleged victims said the cell was so cold she had to ask for a blanket , at which point an officer claimed he would be watching her			1
' [ the officer ] told me ... if i do jumping jacks he 'll be watching : " do n't do jumping jacks naked ' cause i 'll be watching "			0
vulnerable : one woman claims that , after changing into a jail uniform , she was ordered back into her cell and told to take off her underwear , which was being filmed on camera iframe code : captain @entity148 has defended the jail however , saying that the video monitoring is legal and appropriate			1
' when you step foot into a correctional institution , your expectation of privacy is greatly diminished , ' said , adding that officers were not watching the activity on the camera			1
' all of these cases , there are no officers viewing the video or the monitor at any time through any of these allegations , ' he said			0
the captain added that an internal investigation had found no evidence of wrongdoing			2
almost all complainants were being held on suspected dui offenses , for which they are typically released in a matter of hours			1
earlier this year one female complainant said that , after changing into a jail uniform , a jailer asked her to go back into her cell and remove her underwear			2
' what possible security reason could they have ... she 's going to hand herself with her panties ? ' said @entity19 attorney @entity25 , whose law firm is handling the case			0
' she 's about to be released and out the door			2
' mr @entity25 has obtained several surveillance tapes from @entity187 jail through public record requests , which were released to @entity189			1
he said the women were unaware their actions were being recorded on a monitor that was watched by mostly male jailers			0
attorneys acting on behalf of @entity54 city jail say the camera operations inside the facility are standard practive one woman from @entity200 , who chose not to be identified , was arrested for suspected drunk driving in april and said she refused to change her clothes until a female officer was present because she was comfortable with the four male guards nearby			2
' basically i was harassed for not doing it and put back in the holding cell and made to stay there for about 12 hours , ' the woman said			2
another woman said there was no reason for her to strip naked			2
' i thought maybe it was for seeing if we have contraband of something , but we are already patted down , ' she said			2
' so then why would there be a camera still ? ' ' i just did n't feel comfortable with the situation so i was n't going to do it ' : this woman , who asked not to be identified , refused to undress on camera after being arrested on suspected drunk driving jail experts say such levels surveillance were extremely unusual			2
@entity227 , an architect who has designed 40 jails , said he was ' stunned ' by the recently released videos			0
' we do have lots of cameras but ( usually ) you can not watch anywhere where someone is using the shower , toilet facilities or a changing area , ' @entity227 told @entity189			0
however @entity241 attorney @entity240 , speaking on behalf of the jail , said placing cameras in common areas and cells was standard practice and that there are no plans to change such methods			0
' the jail videos we 've watched so far do n't show any inappropriate activity , ' mr @entity240 said			0
@entity252 attorney @entity240 maintained jail officers had acted ' very professionally '			0

victims say they thought police were following protocol when they were ordered to strip in cell with camera
@entity93 obtained by public record requests released as evidence
all complainants were being held on *misdemeanor* charges , mostly @entity17 offenses , and claim they should not have been treated ' like *animals* '
