@entity1 's favelas are a notorious part of the city ’s history , a vibrant but often troubled part of modern @entity6			1
i was guided around one last week and even though this particular favela , @entity10 , is known as a place where the people ’s worst troubles are behind them , it was a humbling and shocking experience			1
at the heart of it there is a football pitch for kids , fenced like a cage , where young people can play in safety			1
but you can see bullet holes in the walls of the adjoining shanty homes			0
doing it by the book : @entity28 with a weighty tome ( left ) and talks to children in the favela ( right ) humbling and shocking experience : @entity28 visited the @entity10 favela in @entity1 my guide , a local guy named @entity36 , said that at the depths of the drug feuds that infested this community , rival gangs would decapitate each other and kick the severed heads around			1
one bloke who follows me on social media joked that i ’d be fine in a favela because i grew up in @entity48			0
i pointed out as nicely as possible that we have it cushy in @entity51			0
the grinding poverty and social extremes in @entity1 ’s poorest districts is something else			2
around 1.4 million people live in about 750 favelas in @entity1 alone			2
with drugs and the attendant gun culture , murder is commonplace			0
@entity10 was one of the earliest cases of a favela being ‘ pacified ’ , with a concerted effort by the authorities and local community to tackle gang culture			1
doing what he does best : @entity28 coaches children in the favela and ( right ) poses with one young lad the police and community work in harmony			1
you can play football in the alleys , and i did have a kickabout while there			0
i met extraordinary people , including a guy who cleans the streets for a living and begs in his ‘ spare ’ time to raise money that he donates to a local scheme that provides football facilities for kids			2
people like that are the glue that binds communities together .			0
