by @entity0 and @entity1 meteorologists are predicting that the weather will go wild later this year			0
the cause is @entity5 , a warming of sea - surface temperatures in the @entity8 , which can trigger both floods and drought in different parts of the world			1
but while scientists are anticipating a stronger - than - usual @entity5 , many are warning that the planet is ill prepared to deal with the consequences			1
a spike in @entity8 sea temperatures and the rapid movement of warm water eastwards have increased fears this year 's @entity5 could be one of the strongest yet			1
@entity5 , pictured left , is a warming of sea temperatures that can trigger floods and droughts			1
@entity27 , pictured right , is when sea temperatures drop @entity5 refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the @entity34 in the central and eastern @entity8 becomes hotter than usual			1
the average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and @entity38 ( approximately 2 and 5 ° f ) warmer than normal during this event			0
this has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere , ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the @entity8 and globally			1
strong @entity5 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			1
at the opposite end of the scale , @entity27 is the climatological counterpart to @entity5			2
@entity27 refers to periods when sea - surface temperatures around the @entity34 are cooler than normal			1
this has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere			0
the more heat in the @entity8 , the large the @entity5 and right now a ball of warm water is crossing the ocean 490ft ( 150 metres ) below the surface			1
a majority of weather forecasting models indicate that the phenomenon may develop around the middle of the year , but it was too early to assess its likely strength , the @entity71 @entity70 said on 15 april			0
meteorologists claim the prospect of an @entity5 will likely be firmed up ' in the next month or two ' , although forecasting its strength will be hard to do			2
the chance of it developing in 2014 exceeded 70 per cent according to @entity84 's @entity83			2
but according to a report in @entity87 , some @entity5 researchers say forecasters are being too conservative			2
‘ one thing i hear over and over again is ' we do not want to create a panic ' , @entity89 of the @entity90 in @entity91 told the magazine			0
one reason is that forecasting a big @entity5 would increase food prices			0
‘ but it may be better to have this reaction at an early stage , when farmers can still adapt , rather than later , ’ he said			0
the worst @entity5 on record in 1997 to 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along @entity107 's @entity106 , pictured , that killed over 1,500 people			0
@entity84 climate experts claim the recent rises in sea temperature are above those seen in previous @entity5 years and suggest this year 's events will be ' significant ' researchers claim that @entity115 , which faces floods , is well prepared for emergencies			1
@entity118 is thought to have invested in water storage in event of a drought			0
scientists ' main concern is @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity84			1
the worst @entity5 on record in 1997 and 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along @entity107 's @entity106 , responsible for killing more than 1,500 people			0
a strong @entity5 also increases fears that production of many key agricultural commodities in @entity125 and @entity84 will suffer			1
strong @entity5 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			1
here , the village of @entity137 , @entity138 , is seen flooded in january 2003 as a result of @entity5 rains , which drove 16,000 people from their homes the impact of this year 's @entity5 events is expected to be felt by every continent			0
during the 1997 to 1998 events , damages were said to have been in the region of between $ 35billion to $ 45billion			0
beachfront homes in @entity150 , @entity115 , pictured , collapsed after two weeks of high surf under @entity5 weather conditions extreme @entity5 events develop differently from standard @entity154 , which first appear in the @entity8			1
the extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28 ° c develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial @entity8			1
this different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns			0
the new patterns result in flash floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others			0
extreme @entity5 events are expected to double in frequency over the next 100 years			2
the impact of extreme @entity5 events is felt by every continent			0
in january , a team of international scientists said extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong @entity154 are expected to double over the next century			0
climate scientists warned countries could be struck by devastating droughts , wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years			0
the team , made up of experts from the @entity181 ( @entity182 ) , the @entity183 @entity184 and @entity185 , also spotted a link between global warming and extreme @entity5 events			2
‘ we currently experience an unusually strong @entity5 event every 20 years			2
our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years , ’ said @entity188 of @entity182 , who co-authored the study			0
‘ @entity5 events are a multi-dimensional problem and only now are we starting to understand better how they respond to global warming , ’ he added			2
extreme @entity5 events develop differently from standard @entity154 , which first appear in the @entity8			1
the extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28 ° c develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial @entity8			1
scientists in @entity200 recently said they can forecast disruptive @entity5 events a year in advance			2
they hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires , pictured in the @entity208			0
meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 @entity5 will be firmed up ' in the next month or two ' this different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns , which result in floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others			1
the impacts of extreme @entity5 events that extended to every continent across the globe in 1997 , for example , killed around 23,000 people			0
dr @entity227 continued : ‘ during an extreme @entity5 event countries in the @entity8 , such as @entity84 and @entity229 , experienced devastating droughts and wild fires , while catastrophic floods occurred in the eastern equatorial region of @entity232 and northern @entity138			1
’ in @entity84 , the drought and dry conditions caused by the 1982 and 1983 extreme @entity5 led to the @entity235 in southeast @entity84 , which resulted in 75 deaths			1
the scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme @entity5 events			2
this satellite image shows the @entity5 weather phenomena in 1997 , represented by the the white area at the equator , which shows how the warm waters stretch from @entity138 to @entity245			0

@entity5 is a warming of sea - surface temperatures in the @entity8
it affects wind patterns and can trigger both severe floods and drought
researchers said rises in temperature are above those seen in recent years
this suggests the 2014 @entity5 could be one of the strongest for decades
some scientists claim areas such as @entity264 , @entity125 and @entity84 will *struggle* to cope , as predictions on its *severity* are not accurate
