by @entity0 a person who has undergone a sex change is fighting a legal battle for the right to have her previous identity as a man officially ' forgotten '			2
the case of @entity8 , who can not be identified for legal reasons , is being seen as a landmark case concerning the rights of transgender persons across the @entity13			1
the 44 - year - old , from the @entity16 area , is challenging the legality of the government ’s retention and use of personal information which reveals she was once male			1
her case centres on the data held on her by the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) as a long - term unemployed person in receipt of jobseeker ’s allowance			1
controversial : a 44 - year - old transgender person is fighting for the right to have their previous gender forgotten in landmark case at @entity16 's @entity36 she says , because details of her transgender status have become known to @entity27 personnel , she has experienced ' intrusive and humiliating interactions ' on visits to her local @entity42 on a fortnightly basis			1
@entity44 , representing @entity45 , told a judge at @entity16 ’s @entity36 : ' she says her previous gender identity as male should be forgotten , except where it is strictly necessary			1
' the right to be treated as a woman and not as transgender is important and deserving respect			0
' ms @entity44 referred to a ruling won by a @entity57 man in the @entity58 against @entity59 that he had a ' right to be forgotten ' and ' irrelevant ' and outdated data about him held by the search engine should be erased at his request			0
ms @entity44 said of @entity45 ’s case : ' this case far more acutely concerns the right to be forgotten			0
' @entity45 considered her gender reassignment ' an intensely private matter ' and ' wholly irrelevant ' to her attempts to find work			0
' c ' says she has experienced ' intrusive and humiliating interactions ' on visits to her local @entity42 and wants her male history deleted			1
file picture ms @entity44 said @entity45 had obtained a full gender recognition certificate ( @entity78 ) under the 2004 @entity79 after many years of struggle involving ' numerous procedures and at great physical and emotional cost '			0
now that transgender persons , in the @entity13 at least , had full recognition in law it was ' fundamental that this recognition should be fully realised , practically and effectively '			1
but the @entity27 was retaining her gender change data on its @entity88 ( @entity89 ) and @entity91 ’ @entity90 , including her previous male name			1
the @entity27 automatically processed the records of transgender customers as ' special customer records ' and applied a ' sensitive account ' marker to keep details confidential , but this failed to give sufficient protection , argued ms @entity44			2
@entity45 ’s details had become known to @entity27 staff who lived within her locality			0
at the same time the extra layers of security were leading to her receiving a poor service , including late payments of benefits			0
ms @entity44 argued the intrusive , unnecessary and indefinite retention of @entity45 ’s details by the @entity27 was in breach of her human rights , as well as data protection and anti-discrimination legislation			2
lawyers for the @entity27 argue its policies are not discriminatory or intrusive but carefully balance the need to give effect to @entity45 ’s legal rights while the department carries out its functions			2
they also argue @entity121 expressly contemplated the data would be held by social security and pension systems , and there was no requirement to ' rewrite history ' and delete information that recorded a person ’s previously held gender .			0

the 44 - year - old @entity132 says previous gender should be wiped records
claims she had ' intrusive and humiliating interactions ' with @entity42 staff
the case could have huge implications for the rights of transgender persons
