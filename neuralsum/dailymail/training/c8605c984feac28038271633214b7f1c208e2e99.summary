@entity1 gov. @entity0 is strongly hinting at a @entity3 run			2
the union - busting @entity5 governor , known nationally for his triumph in a 2012 recall election , is making the rounds in early primary states and on tuesday evening launched a political committee			1
' i do n’t think it ’s ever been good to bet against me , ' @entity0 said last night of a possible presidential campaign while on @entity16 's @entity15			1
' i would n’t be betting against me in a race like this , either			0
@entity0 had a breakthrough moment at the forum for conservatives in the early presidential primary state and on tuesday took a step toward a presidential run recently inaugurated to a second term , @entity0 overcame the odds in november and won his third statewide election since 2010			1
less than one year into his first term @entity0 was confronted with a recall election by critics of a bill he helped push through the @entity1 legislature that sharply cut back on collective bargaining rights for unionized workers and increased the amount of money that state and local government employees were expected to contribute to their pensions			1
after a court battle that landed the law in @entity1 's highest court , republicans in the state emerged victorious			0
the kerfuffle sparked backlash against @entity0 and in november of 2011 his opponents began the effort to get him removed from office along with his lt. gov. @entity56			2
the duo made history on june 5 , 2012 , when they won the challenge with a larger share of the vote than they did in their initial election			0
@entity0 is the first and only governor to have survived a recall in @entity68 history			1
the 47 - year - old @entity5 politician was born in @entity70 , @entity71 , to a baptist minister and a bookkeeper			0
his family relocated to @entity1 when he was 10			0
@entity0 attended @entity75 but left before he obtained a degree and joined the staff of the @entity78			2
he began his career in @entity1 politics in 1990 with a campaign for the state assembly			0
he lost that race but won a special election in another district three years later			0
that same year he married his wife , @entity86			0
the couple has two sons together , @entity89 and @entity90			0
the teenagers take classes at @entity75 and @entity93 , respectively			0
the elder @entity0 served in the @entity94 nearly a decade before running for and winning a seat on @entity97 's executive committee , a role he stayed in until being promoted to governor			1
@entity0 's first attempt at the governor 's mansion ended with him dropping out of the race early because he was unable to raise enough money to support the bid			1
four years later , in 2010 , he and @entity56 were elected to the state 's top two posts - positions they have held ever since			0
long considered a dark horse candidate for president , @entity0 's stock went up in november after he cemented his reelection in @entity1			1
while he has not specifically stated his intentions to compete for the keys to 1600 @entity115 he 's made at least one high - profile political hire in the last few weeks that would otherwise seem odd given that he 's only just begun his second term as governor			1
nothing in @entity1 law would prevent @entity0 from seeking an unlimited amount of terms , however , should he show interest in staying on in 2019			2
@entity0 recently brought on former @entity126 political director @entity125 to run his newly founded @entity128 political committee , which is legally considered a 527			1
the tax - exempt group can raise unlimited amounts of money for @entity0 's national travel as long as he 's not officially a candidate any office			1
it can not share its money with candidates or candidates ' political action committees , though			0
meaning , if @entity0 were to run for president , the money in that fund could not be transferred to his campaign - or anyone else 's campaign , for that matter			1
the organization can advocate on behalf of the policies that @entity0 has spent his career defending , though , one of the governor 's aides told the @entity152 , and that 's the role it will take on if @entity0 enters the 2016 competition			1
' @entity128 encompasses the shared values that make our country great : limiting the powers of the federal government to those defined in the @entity161 while creating a leaner , more efficient , more effective and more accountable government to the @entity68 people , ' @entity0 said in a statement announcing the political group			1
in his saturday speech at the @entity22 , @entity0 promised @entity24 voters that he would return to the state ' many more times in the future			2
' last night he said on @entity16 that he planned to visit @entity24 and two other important primary states - @entity172 and @entity173 - in the coming weeks if the purpose of the group was n't clear already - to serve as a launching pad for @entity0 's national aspirations - a video released by @entity128 on tuesday night with its website launch answered that very question			1
' @entity68 stands on the brink , ' a male narrator with a quintessential campaign ad voice states			1
' at a time and place in our history where failed leaders preside over a nation adrift , with family incomes in steady decline , dreams stifled , and a foreign policy that apologize for @entity68 , an dprojects weakness abroad , @entity68 ca n't stop this by looking to the past , or for answers in @entity198 ' throughout his speech , pictures of @entity200 and and presumed @entity203 presidential candidate @entity202 flash on the screen			1
the first shows @entity200 talking to current secretary of state @entity206 and national security advisor @entity207			2
another depicts @entity200 bowing to @entity210 emperor akihito			2
shifting to photos of @entity0 , the narrator says , ' to reclaim our destiny , we must turn to bold , fresh and new ideas from those incubators of reform - the states			2
' ' those groups in @entity198 , they tend to measure success by how many people are dependent on the government , ' @entity0 can be heard saying in a speech to roars from the crowd as a photo of @entity200 and former secretary of state @entity228 standing side by side at an event appears			2
' we measure success by how many people are no longer dependent on the government , ' he concludes			0
the not - so - subtle implication is evident : @entity228 would continue the foreign policies of her predecessor , @entity200			2

pictured behind the governor are his son @entity90 and wife , @entity86			0
not seen is his son @entity89 a video for @entity0 's new political committee , @entity128 , uses this photo of president @entity200 bowing to @entity210 emperor @entity251 in 2009 to bash @entity200 's leadership on foreign policy issues not previously considered they type of fiery speaker that riles up conservatives , @entity0 has made significant strides in that direction throughout the past year			1
a speech he gave over the weekend at @entity24 congressman @entity262 's first - ever @entity22 had attendees leaving with a new perspective on his probable presidential campaign			1
@entity0 was widely panned by media attendees as the breakout speaker of the event			0
the event 's host , the uber conservative rep. @entity262 , agreed			0
basically , the press reports i read were mostly accurate in their analysis , ' @entity262 told @entity274			0
' probably the person who helped himself the most would be @entity0 , ' @entity262 said			0
' the bar was n't as high , and he gave a good speech			0
he connected with the audience in a good , constructive way			0
' @entity0 repeated some of his favorite lines to the audience , several of which were also featured in his @entity128 video , including the claim about government dependency , and promised @entity24 voters that he would return to the state ' many more times in the future			0
' last night on @entity16 's program he confirmed that he 'd be back in early primary state @entity24 soon , as well as first in the nation state @entity172 and @entity173 , another state with a race - making - or breaking - primary			1
' my budget [ will ] come out next tuesday — for the fifth and sixth year in a row i ’ll lower property taxes , ' @entity0 said on @entity16 , according to the @entity299			1
' i want a few months to get that job done , ' he said , ' but i ’m going to be in @entity172 , in @entity173 and back in @entity24 and we ’re going to be talking about these issues for the next several months , [ because ] we ’re excited about where we can take this country			0
