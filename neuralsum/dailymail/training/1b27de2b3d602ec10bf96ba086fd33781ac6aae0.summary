@entity0 has issued an apology after realizing that a man that they interviewed about his actions on the night of the attack in @entity7 was lying on air			1
@entity9 previously worked as a security contractor hired by the @entity11 and he told 60 minutes that he was not on the ground of the @entity13 when the attack began on the night of september 11 , 2012 , but he rushed over as soon as he heard			1
after his interview with reporter @entity16 aired on the show last sunday , his account began being questioned publicly and though the initially stood by him - believing his claims that he was the subject of a slander attack by the @entity11 - they issued a public apology for their mistake on friday			1
that 's very disappointing for any journalist , that 's very disappointing for me , ’ @entity28 said when she gave an on - air mea culpa during @entity44			0
‘ nobody likes to admit that they made a mistake , but if you do , you have to stand up and take responsibility and you have to say that you were wrong and in this case we were wrong			0
’ during the original interview , @entity9 - who went by the pseudonym that he used while writing a book about his version of events , @entity61 - said that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived at the consulate on the evening of the attack			1
he also said that he later saw the body of ambassador @entity72 when he went to a local hospital that evening			0
now it has been revealed that in reports he made both to his company , @entity78 , and the @entity79 , he said that he never made it to the compound on the night of the attack			1
he said in those reports that he never made it to the @entity85 compound until the next morning on september 12			0
@entity28 said that they were aware of the discrepancy between the version of events that he was telling @entity0 and the @entity78 report , saying that before they aired the piece he told them that he lied in the company ’s report to go along with his boss ’ story which said that @entity9 tried going to the mission but there were roadblocks and he could n’t make it			1
lies : @entity9 told 60 minutes that he scaled a 12 - foot wall to get into the compound and then fought a terrorist to the ground once he got inside			1
he also said he saw the dead body of the @entity36 ambassador ‘ his boss is someone he cared about enormously			2
he cared about his @entity36 counterparts in the mission that night , and when his boss told him not to go , he could n't stay back			1
so that was always part of the record for us , ’ @entity28 said			0
she made it clear that what they did not know was that @entity9 had given that account to the @entity79 in their incident report			1
his involvement with the @entity79 report came via the @entity124 after the 60 minutes piece aired , and @entity28 said that when they confronted him over the claims , he denied it			2
@entity28 said that they have since tried contacting @entity9 about the situation and they have not been able to get in touch with him			2
‘ we were misled and we were wrong and that 's the important thing and that 's what we have to say here : we have to set the record straight and take responsibility , ’ she said			0
placing the blame : while she repeatedly said @entity39 was taking responsibility , she said that they were ' misled ' by @entity9 who did not tell them that he gave a different version of events to the @entity79 @entity9 motivation to lie presumably has something to do with the fact that he is coming out with a book about alleged warnings that he gave the @entity36 government about security flaws before the attack			1
the publisher of the book , @entity157 , has now said that they have retracted the book			0
pulled : the publisher announced on friday that it will stop selling @entity162 ' book it had already been on sale online and an unknown number of people had already bought the book			0
@entity168 announced friday afternoon that ' in light of information that has been brought to our attention ' they will no longer be selling the book			0
anyone who purchased the book in the past week since it went on the market can now return it to the publisher , @entity174 reports			0
the book itself was another problem for 60 minutes because while they did disclose that @entity9 had a book that was being published , they failed to mention that @entity185 is an imprint of @entity168 which is owned by @entity0			1
@entity187 said that they got a statement from @entity9 who said that his book is ' consistent ' with what he told @entity36 authorities and the @entity79 , but their own reporter said that there were discrepancies between his book and official reports			1
when asked about what steps they took to vet that @entity9 was telling the truth before they put him on air , @entity28 said that they did independent research and also used material that he provided			2
' we verified that he was who he said he was , that he was working for the @entity11 at the time , that he was in @entity7 at the @entity85 compound the night of the attack , ' she said on @entity0 ' morning news show			2
' he gave us access to communications that he had with government officials			0
we used @entity36 government reports and congressional testimony to verify many of the details of his story and everything checked out			2
he also showed us photographs that he had taken at the @entity85 compound the following morning			0
' watch the video here			0
