' there was a delayed start to the second event of the day due to a technical issue related to the judges ' electronic scoring systems			1
it meant the divers could not follow their progress on the scoreboard			0
like fish to water : @entity3 and @entity1 were brilliant off the 10m platform at the @entity14 disappointment : it must have been hard to take the silver after losing out on top spot after four dives loyal supporter : @entity72 was in @entity15 cheering on the two @entity2 girls with a flag @entity1 and @entity3 brushed aside the delay , but felt their final dive , a back two - and - a - half somersault with one - and - a - half twists , was scored low at 69.12 by the judges as the @entity23 pair took gold			1
' we had an inkling that we were leading , ' @entity1 said			2
' normally we do our last dive pretty well , so a little bit disappointed with that			0

we 're pretty happy with silver			2

perfection : the @entity2 pair plunge towards the pool from the high board @entity120 saved his best dive till last to total 365.45 in fourth place , while @entity123 , who is representing @entity125 but was born in @entity126 , scored 333.10 to progress in eighth			1

close but no cigar : the @entity23 duo of @entity22 and @entity137 came out on top in the end			1

10 - metre platform pair were leading for four of five dives
only @entity17 were missing from the field that entered the @entity47
@entity23 ended up coming out on top , less than four points ahead
they thought they would finish fifth so were happy with second spot
the @entity2 duo cooled off in the showers while *waiting* for their points after the electronic scoring system broke down
