introducing @entity0 , the anonymous @entity1 writer who , after moving to @entity2 , decided to set up her own dating blog chronicling her dating escapades in the @entity5			1
little did she know however that her blog – which she started to keep her friends at home in @entity9 updated with her love life – would become an internet hit with women emailing her nonstop for dating advice			1
‘ when i moved to @entity2 , my @entity9 friends were a bit panicky that there would be no dating disasters to point and laugh at on a regular basis , ’ she said , ' so i set up the blog			1
' @entity0 is looking for the one in the @entity5 , she says that she hopes to find her @entity22 on the dating app. tinder users ( left ) can swipe left for those they do n't fancy and right for those they do ‘ @entity28 was never part of the plan , i ’d actually never heard of it until my second night in @entity2			1
i decided to download it and became completely hooked			0
now @entity0 has become much bigger than it was ever intended to be ! ’ but teh 20something she says that even though her close friends and family know about it , she plans to remain anonymous , ‘ to avoid potential murder from some of the more unhinged dates that i have written about … @entity0 continued , ‘ one of my dates – who i named worst person on @entity28 - turned out to be a jui - jitsuer and i now carry a small amount of fear wherever i go that he might be around the corner with a karate chop for my head			1
’ @entity28 is a dating app that first became popular in 2013			2
the app allows you to scroll through a large number of profiles swiping right for people you like the look of and left for those you do n’t			0
@entity0 blogs about her dating experiences			1
she uses a rating system and describes her dates clothing , however , she does not use their real names instead giving them code @entity28 names luckily for @entity0 she says that so far only one match has worked out who she is ( and he probably should n’t have been messaging her in the first place )			1
‘ i received a text from a man i call @entity28 [ because he ’s married ] saying , ‘ you wrote about me ’ , which was a little terrifying			0
i ’d rather hoped we might never speak again			0
‘ apparently someone that he matched with on @entity28 sent him the link to the blog asking if it was him			2
luckily , since he was married and lying about it , i figured i still maintained the moral high - ground … ’ @entity0 says some dates are worse that others			2
she 's even met a married man on the app who discovered her true identity ( posed by models ) @entity0 explains that when she first downloaded @entity28 the excitement and novelty of it led her to go on three or four dates a week			2
but now she ’s chooses a little more carefully , ‘ i ’ve accepted that my soulmate probably is n’t in a strip bar , or in @entity93 , so i ’m a lot more picky with who i date			0
and she ’s still hopeful that she will meet ‘ the one ’ on the dating app. she said , ‘ it would be lovely to tell my grandchildren that my husband and i met on the moorlands when he rescued me on horseback from a vicious storm , but as i do n’t frequent moorlands i ’m grateful for @entity28			0
‘ i hear of @entity28 romances and engagements all the time , so i ’m very hopeful that my 6 ’ 2 ” , gorgeous , kind , witty writer is going to appear on @entity28 any day now			0
but for now she says that writing about bad dates makes up for having to go on them , ‘ the worst date i ever had was with worst person on @entity28 and i wrote about it immediately			0
‘ writing about a bad date is fun , and is the only retribution for having been present at said bad date			0
‘ it ’s a lot harder to write about heartbreak … i do n’t want the blog to turn into a mopey pity party , so i needed a little distance before i was able to write about @entity122			0
and as for @entity0 ’s future plans she revealed , ‘ i ’d love to turn the blog into a fictional book one day			1
' right now i am currently working on a feminist ’s guide to online dating which has been borne out of the many emails that i receive from readers asking for dating advice , and the hours i put in with friends to help them with their tinder profiles			1
' she added , ' i seem to be pretty good at helping others with their dating lives … now i just need to find someone who will fix mine ! the thought of telling my perfect match about the blog though fills me with absolute dread			2
