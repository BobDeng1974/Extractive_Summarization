by @entity0 published : 05:35 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 05:35 est , 11 december 2012 police could soon be armed with handcuffs that deliver an electric shock to arrested people who refuse to go quietly			2
a @entity6 firm has applied for a patent for a new kind of restraint that can literally shock detainees into submission if they refuse to cooperate			2
the design is not limited to handcuffs , but also could be applied equally to ankle cuffs , straight jackets , restraining belts , neck collars and even facial restraints			2
' the augmented detainee restraint ' : police could soon be armed with handcuffs that are able to administer electric shocks to prisoners			1
an image from the patent filing is pictured above and the company behind it envision not only delivering electric shocks , but also provide for systems that could administer sedative drugs to those held captive			1
the idea is likely to shock civil liberties groups and could spark a new debate regarding how far force can be legitimately used to keep detainees quiet			0
@entity37 , which first broke the story , commented : ' whether you 're in law enforcement or in an activist group , it 's an interesting read that will keep your interest			0
' yes , the cuffs are designed to restrain " the bad guys , " but it sure looks as though there 's potential here for abuse in the form of mild torture			0
' this kind of invention will have to be carefully monitored and legislated to exacting standards so that the " good guys " walk the line on this one			0
' schematic : the cuffs could be controlled internally using various sensors that detect when the person locked in them starts to misbehave , or they could be externally activated by a guard @entity6 patent application 20120298119 describes a ' system for restraining detainees through devices attached to the detainees and configured to administer electrical shocks when certain predetermined conditions occur			1
' the cuffs , developed by @entity75 - based firm @entity74 , could be controlled internally using various sensors that indicate when the person locked in them starts to misbehave			1
alternatively , whoever is guarding the captive could choose when to administer electric shocks , or a signal could be sent automatically when , for example , the detainee moves beyond a certain range			1
according to the patent application , safety mechanisms could be included in the control mechanism of the cuffs to stop the detainee from receiving too much current too quickly			0
in one embodiment , it could be equipped with sensors to determine just how much electrical current a detainee can take , so that they are not inadvertently killed by the device			0
for example , if the sensors determine that the captive has a health issue like a weak heart , a warning could be issued to the person or system controlling the device			0
boundary control : the device could also be linked to a sensor that can automatically deliver an electric shock to its wearer when they move inside or outside a predetermined perimeter a further feature of the device envisioned by @entity115 inventions is a drug delivery system that , according to the patent filing , could administer ' an irritant , a medication , a sedative , a transdermal medication or transdermal enhancers such as dimethyl sulfoxide , a chemical restraint , a paralytic , a medication prescribed to the detainee , and combinations thereof '			1
this could word either by means of a moveable needle or gas injection system , the patent says , and could be in addition or in place of electric shocks			1
the patent includes a number of schematic - type drawings of the planned device			2
however it also includes one image that stood out as appearing like a photograph of an actual prototype , suggesting that electric handcuffs could be available to a police force near you soon .			0

@entity75 - based company has applied to patent the *technology*
it could also be used to administer drugs as well as electric shocks
device can be activated automatically or controlled by another *human*
