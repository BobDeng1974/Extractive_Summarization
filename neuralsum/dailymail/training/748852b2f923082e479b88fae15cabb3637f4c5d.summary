' @entity49 ’s really found the perfect @entity50 , but as we all know he ’s a little bit grubby			2
eating bacon with his hands , from a pasta bowl , why is there jam on the remote control ? ! ' and after he ’s been to the loo , it wo n't be smelling of flowers			0
its actually probably best not go in there , for the next 24 hours ' and if that was n't enough you ’ve got to put up us too , too late @entity49 , you ’ve already said “ i do ! "			0
' the happy couple held their wedding reception at @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , and were visibly shocked when freelance computer programmer @entity11 popped on a tracksuit top and baseball cap and started to rap			1
' @entity18 has been my best friend since we were about four years old , ' @entity11 said ' we 've been great mates for all these years			1
' he asked me to be his best man in december			2
i had an inkling he was going to because we all made agreements many years ago down the pub that we 'd all be each other 's best men			0
' so when the time came i thought " okay , he 's quite a character so there 's a lot of material " , but the trouble was it was all very disparate chunks			2
' it was little funny things that he had done but nothing that you could stretch out to a full anecdotal speech			2
' response : @entity11 's rap sparked a standing ovation at the @entity72 wedding breakfast @entity11 , from @entity99 , said he was finding it more and more difficult to concoct something when inspiration struck			1
close : @entity11 with groom @entity18 on his wedding day , where his friend gave a memorable and now celebrated rap speech ' i had snippets of things that i started making rhyming couplets with			1
then i thought " hang on a minute - i could do something with this ' and started piecing it together into a rap			1
i 'm a big fan of @entity14 and i thought i could do a rap in a similar style			1
i put the track together using @entity23 samples which fitted perfectly			0
' my girlfriend pushed me into doing it and said ' you need to do this '			0
it got to the point where i was running out of time because i 'd put so much effort into it and i was past the point of no return			0
it was do or die , ' he added			0
' i have been dj - ing since 1999 and i dabble with music production , which , of course , helped me put the track together			0

' only my girlfriend knew what i was going to do , ' he said			0
' i managed to keep it a massive secret			0
' it 's clearly evident in the video that nobody had an idea because you look at the bride as i 'm starting the rap and she looks terrified			1

' it went in a blur but i was very focused on getting it right			0
i did n't drink throughout the day because i could n't miss a single line or word as it would n't work			0
luckily i managed to get it right			0
' securing a standing ovation from the stunned audience , he said the best part was relaxing after his big moment			1
' everyone was coming up to me and saying ' i tell you what - that 's the best best man 's speech i 've ever seen '			1
