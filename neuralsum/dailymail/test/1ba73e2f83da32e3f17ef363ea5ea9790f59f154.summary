@entity0 took a bullet in the forearm during the deadliest mass shooting on a @entity5 military base , and returned to @entity6 five years later with other survivors on friday to receive @entity9 medals			1
some smiled over an honor they felt was overdue , but also clenched their teeth over needs in their scarred and injured lives they say the @entity15 has denied			1
' i try not to be bitter			1
but it 's kind of hard not to be bitter , ' said @entity0 , a former staff sergeant			1
following years of tension , the @entity15 gave the @entity51 to survivors and relatives of the dead in a somber ceremony on the @entity57 military post , just two miles from where @entity33 had opened fire in a room of unarmed soldiers			1
top military commanders recalled tables that became makeshift stretchers to transport the wounded and dying			1
ten of the survivors remain on active duty			0
' it is our sincere hope that in some small way this will help heal the wounds you have suffered , ' @entity15 lt. gen. @entity66 said			1
but words of gratitude from military leaders and elected officials , including @entity80 @entity57 senators @entity78 and @entity81 , gave way to medal recipients pressing and chastising the @entity84 over combat benefits			2
the @entity9 , given to military personnel wounded in battle , offers increased retirement pay			2
@entity78 said he expects @entity6 victims to finally get approved for entitlements within weeks , noting that he spoke to army secretary @entity91 before the ceremony			2
terrorist : @entity33 ( pictured ) was convicted by a military judge in 2013 in the killings , and he recommended the death penalty he snapped : army psychiatrist @entity33 opened fire on november 5 , 2009 , killing 13 men and women at the military post in @entity101 , @entity57 , injuring 30 others before he was shot himself @entity103 : @entity104 , foreground , wife of @entity106 who was killed during the attack by @entity33 , carries her husband 's @entity108 back to her chair many survivors are also seeking separate financial damages in a lawsuit , claiming the @entity5 government should have known of @entity33 's extremist views			1
during his 2013 trial , @entity33 told jurors he had ' switched sides ' in what he called @entity5 's war with @entity121			2
he admitted beginning the rampage by pulling out a pistol and shouting ' @entity124 ' ( @entity125 is great ) and said he wanted to stop @entity5 soldiers from being deployed to kill fellow @entity127			0
@entity128 , a @entity6 police officer at the time , helped end the attack in a gunfight with @entity33			2
she was awarded the @entity108 medal but after the ceremony expressed frustration over uncertainty about the level of benefits @entity6 victims would receive			0
' these soldiers are going to get what they rightfully deserve , ' @entity140 said			0
the award : dozens of @entity51 and two @entity145 were awarded at @entity6 , @entity57 to victims and family of the 2009 terrorist attack military officials had long denied the @entity9 awards because they called the attack an act of workplace violence , not terrorism			1
@entity78 and others have long condemned that classification , but he said changing the distinction could have jeopardized the case against @entity33 , who was not charged with terrorism			0
last year , @entity160 approved new eligibility requirements for @entity51 that forced the @entity84 to reconsider			0
the daughter of @entity106 , a physician 's assistant who was the only civilian killed in the attack , accepted the @entity108 medal for her father and used the occasion to draw attention to veteran suicides			1
@entity106 was shot while as he rushed toward @entity33 with a chair lifted over his head			0
' the first month after dad died , everyone asked us , " what can i do ? " and it was great , ' @entity176 said			0
' nobody asks me that any more			0
