by @entity0 published : 12:31 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 12:31 est , 10 january 2013 the husband of the @entity3 principal who was killed in the shooting has retired from his job at the local middle school as he braces for life without his wife			1
@entity9 met his wife @entity10 when they both worked at @entity12 - she as the assistant principal and he as the seventh grade math teacher - before she left to head up the elementary school			1
though he is 70 - years - old , and well over the state ’s average retirement age of 59 , his move was unexpected but not surprising given the shooting			1
‘ @entity9 was that type of educator			1
’ he did not release a public statement after he decided to leave his job , but he did speak out immediately after the december 14 shooting and he was understandably emotional			2
' @entity10 and i built this beautiful house in the @entity38 , our dream , ' mr @entity9 told @entity41			1
' and the dream was a chronological dream it was going to be @entity10 's house : i was going to die because i 'm much older than @entity10 , it was going to be @entity10 's house			2
happy : @entity9 said he and wife @entity10 planned to spend years together at a house they had built ' @entity10 's grandchildren and all these children could use the house on the lake and it would be wonderful			1
’ the @entity9 family is made up of @entity9 's three daughters from his first marriage , @entity10 's two daughters from her first marriage , and their collective 11 grandchildren			1
' we built rooms downstairs for kids and it was going to be @entity10 's house ultimately , with all the children			2
and now it 's me - i do n't think i can do that , ' he said last month			2
one thing the family has to look forward to , however , is mrs @entity75 's daughter @entity74 's wedding this summer			0
she and her fiance appeared in several television interviews in the wake of the shooting , talking about the life @entity10 lived			0
' i had a really hard time not being mad about it but that 's who she was , ' @entity74 said of the way that @entity10 tried to stop the shooter			1
support : @entity74 , who weds this summer , appeared on the show with her fiance , @entity88 where they met : @entity9 was teaching middle school math when he met @entity10 ( right ) who was an assistant principal at the middle school at the time , before she left to work at @entity3 ' she faced every single problem that she ever had in her life head on			1
' my cousin referred to her as a ' bull ' yesterday			0
there 's no stopping @entity10 when she has a mission			0
she gets it done and she gives it everything she has			0
' as @entity74 struggled to control her tears , her fiance stood beside her			0
' for some reason @entity10 loved me and it 's my job now to be there for her daughter , ' @entity88 said			0
' i accept that job with open arms and i 'll be there for her in any way possible			0
' tales of her heroism are helping mrs @entity75 's relatives process their grief , but only slightly			0
' @entity10 put herself in jeopardy and i have been angry about that - angry - until just now , today , when i met the two women who she told to go under shelter while she confronted the gunman and she could have avoided that , but she did n't and i knew she would n't , ' mr @entity9 said			1
' i 'm not angry anymore , i 'm just very sad			0
' proud moment : @entity126 holds @entity128 's granddaughter as he visits @entity3 on sunday devastated : her daughter tweeted the picture and expressed her grief at losing her mother during the shooting , @entity10 ' ran out , and actually tried to subdue the killer			1
i do n't know where that comes from , @entity10 was five - foot - two			2
' since the @entity140 officially accepted mr @entity9 ’s resignation on wednesday night , it is now teachers who are upset over the departure of an accomplished colleague			2
‘ he was one of the most creative people you ever were to meet			0
he knows his content , but connects with kids , ’ mr @entity25 said of mr @entity9 , who taught for 40 years and four months			1
‘ you just ca n’t replace him , ’ he said to @entity150			0

@entity3 died when she tried to stop the shooter at @entity3
her husband @entity9 , 70 , taught math at the local middle school
@entity9 retired after 40 - year teaching *career* as he grieves
