@entity0 straight wins for @entity1 and 17 league goals for @entity3 – the numbers are frightening and even more so when put alongside those of @entity6 who have only scored 13 league goals as a team so far this season			1
@entity1 ran out 4 - 0 winners over @entity11 and even by recent standards this was spectacular stuff with @entity3 scoring the first goal after just 99 seconds			1
the goal owed much to the tenacity of full - back @entity18 and the precision of the pass from @entity22 , but also to @entity3 ’s own ruthless efficiency			1
the shot was practically @entity3 ’s first touch			2
@entity50 ’s first touch was to pick the ball out of his own net			0
@entity3 almost paid @entity18 back for his part in the goal with a back - heeled assist from the same byline from where the defender had played his part in the opening goal but @entity18 ’s shot went high over @entity50 ’s bar			1
@entity1 were again playing with their midfield quartet of pass - masters @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity26 and @entity68 and again they had rivals @entity11 dizzy as they dominated possession			1
it is little wonder that some @entity1 fans are wondering just who drops out when @entity75 returns			0
the @entity76 was left out of the squad but could be fit for tuesday as @entity6 bring their dismal recent record to the @entity79			0
one player who is unlikely to be left out is @entity26 who scored the second goal on the half hour with a wonder volley from just inside the area			1
@entity18 took a throw - in that @entity22 flicked up to the 23 - year - old			2
the @entity44 striker expected the @entity38 midfielder to play the ball back to him but instead @entity1 ’s £ 60 million summer signing just lashed it first time into @entity50 ’s top corner			1
it summed up @entity1 ’s current sky - high confidence and the whole @entity1 bench were on their feet to applaud the flash of brilliance			2
@entity3 ( centre ) was a constant menace to the @entity11 defence as his sensational season continues @entity103 ( left ) came on before half - time due to an injury to first - choice right back @entity18 @entity22 ( right ) made it 3 - 0 to @entity1 shortly after half - time with a neatly - taken finish @entity22 ( centre ) is congratulated by @entity103 ( left ) and @entity68 as they cruise to an easy victory the only threat to @entity1 was coming from themselves with @entity113 and @entity114 flying studs - first into each other as they tried to block a rare @entity11 attack			1
@entity18 then pulled up with an ankle problem and had to be replaced by @entity103 before the break			0
the change did little to affect the game but will be one fewer problem for @entity6 if he is out on tuesday			0
@entity103 does not carry quite the same threat going forward			0
@entity1 made it three on 54 minutes and there was more @entity3 brilliance although for once in the assist and not the finish – his back - heeled pass into space played @entity22 through perfectly and he dispatched with ease past @entity50			1
@entity11 came into the game more in the second half and @entity113 had to block a @entity135 shot			1
the ball came out to the same player but he fired over			0
@entity138 was busier too and got down well to block a shot from @entity140 as @entity11 looked for a consolation goal			2
@entity26 ( front ) made it 4 - 0 late on , tapping home from close range as @entity1 celebrated an 11th straight win the 23 - year - old ( left ) is all smiles with @entity113 as the @entity150 outfit move top of @entity27 @entity3 ( centre ) was hugged by a young fan as he left the pitch at full - time following @entity1 's emphatic triumph but there were also chances at the other end with @entity159 hitting the bar and @entity22 missing from close range and when the next goal did come it was @entity1 ’s			1
@entity22 played @entity103 down the right and his cross was turned goalwards by @entity3			1
the ball may have trickled in anyway but @entity26 made sure sliding it over the line for his second goal of the game			2
@entity11 coach @entity171 had been furious before the game because he felt he had been misquoted saying ‘ all i ask is that they do n’t walk all over us ’			0
he tore the offending @entity176 front page up in his pre-match press conference			0
if it had been designed to inspire his players it failed			0
@entity1 had walked all over @entity11 and torn them to pieces			2
@entity6 face a team in terrifying form			0
@entity11 boss @entity171 ( left ) looks on helplessly as his side ca n't contain the threat of @entity24 's formidable team			0

@entity3 put @entity1 ahead after two minutes against @entity11 with a low right - footed strike
@entity26 doubled the **visitors** advantage in the first half with a left - footed shot into the top right - hand corner
@entity22 added a third for @entity1 on 54 minutes at the @entity194
@entity26 completed the *scoreline* in the final few minutes of the match as **visitors** record 11th straight win
result moves @entity1 to top of @entity27 on 24 points after 10 games but having played a game more than their title rivals
