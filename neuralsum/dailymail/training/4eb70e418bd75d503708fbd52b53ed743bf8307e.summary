town halls may be forced to switch off street lights unless they get more money to pay for the care of the elderly in their own homes , council leaders have warned the letter to @entity29 , from the @entity31 - dominated @entity30 , which represents 370 councils , comes as he finalises the next round of cuts in the spending review			1
the @entity30 argues that the amount of money spent on social care has already been slashed by a fifth in less than three years - and they warn that they are preparing to reduce budgets further			0
the town hall leaders say that , while they have been able to save most of that money by squeezing the amount they pay to care homes and other contractors , they are running out of ways to cut costs			0
the @entity30 ’s letter calls for fundamental change in the way money is allocated and an end to the special protections that the health service budget enjoys			0
council leaders have written to chancellor @entity29 to plead for more @entity10 funding to be diverted into their coffers to help meet the spiralling costs of care for pensioners and the disabled ‘ social care is one of the things that you lie awake at night worrying about , ’ said sir @entity62 , the @entity31 leader of @entity64 and @entity64 council in @entity65 , who is chairman of the @entity30			1
