by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 10:24 est , 2 september 2013 a determined @entity2 survivor , who made the brave decision to have her left foot amputated , has taken the first tentative steps in her beloved high heels with a new prosthetic leg			1
@entity8 , 39 , decided to have her foot amputated after two surgeries and advice from doctors that keeping it may lead to a life blighted by chronic pain			1
ms @entity8 walked in a pair of four - inch nude stilettos last week , five months on from the devastating attack on april 15			1
' she joked that she might need to leave the town where she lives because there are so many cobbled streets which are typically difficult to negotiate in towering heels			0
the bombing survivor currently has a prosthetic leg which she says is a little on the bulky side			0
she has also used a waterproof prosthetic to allow her to do one of her favorite activities of paddle - boarding			0
however thanks to @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , ms @entity8 is being fitted for a new limb with a silicon cover which will look much more like her other leg			1
the artificial limb costs in the region of $ 20,000 and will take around a month to complete			0
in one of many harrowing decisions made in the wake of the attack , ms @entity8 made the choice to have her foot amputated			1
she said that her doctor ' gave me the rundown , as did several other doctors , on the choice i had , and basically it was whether to keep my leg , the rest , my foot actually is where the injury occurred , or to amputate sort of below the knee '			2
she added : ' and it certainly was a difficult decision , but when i weighed the pros and cons , i think this was the best option for me			0
first steps : ms @entity8 is having a new silicon - covered prosthetic leg created by @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 well - heeled : the 39 - year - old 's plaster - covered artificial limb			1
she says once it is finished , she hopes it will help her get back to ' wearing things she used to wear ' @entity76 strong : @entity8 is one of several victims who has bravely spoken out following the bombing			2
she was given the honor of throwing the first pitch at @entity81 ( right ) ' it would likely be shorter , one of my legs would likely be shorter than the other , and i would n't be able to live the lifestyle that i did prior to the injury			0
' on the day of the bombings , ms @entity8 and half a dozen friends took in the traditional @entity92 game at @entity81			1
they left early and headed to @entity94 , a bar close to the blast site			0
ms @entity8 was at the back of the long line , waiting as bouncers checked @entity100 , when the first blast went off			1
unlike many , she knew exactly what it was			0
' i felt like i was watching the footage on 9/11 , ' said @entity106 , who works in human resources for @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity22			2
