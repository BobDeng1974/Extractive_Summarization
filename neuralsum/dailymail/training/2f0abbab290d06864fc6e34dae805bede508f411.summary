by @entity0 published : 17:26 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 17:27 est , 9 january 2014 researchers have found that fast food may be less unhealthy than a bottomless pasta bowl			1
@entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 ’s boast a significant amount of meals that have more calories , saturated fat and sodium than is recommended and even more than a @entity14 's value meal , according to the @entity15 - @entity17 study			1
the team studied more than 2,600 menu items across the three chains in an effort to help diners better understand what they are eating , @entity18 reported			0
the healthier choice ? : surprisingly , the answer is yes in many cases more than half of the items served at the seemingly healthier options than the @entity32 were labelled ‘ healthy , ’ but there was no uniform standard for making that determination , the study showed			1
@entity37 found that meals consisting of a shared appetizer , adult entrée and side dish averaged 1,495 calories and contained 28 grams of saturated fat and 3,312 milligrams of sodium , @entity36 noted			2
federal guidelines suggest adults eat about 2,000 calories per day , children roughly 1,400			0
those suggestions were easily surpassed when including drinks , the study said			0
‘ consumers tend to view full - service restaurants as superior in quality and healthfulness compared with quick service restaurants , ’ the team wrote			1
‘ however , a few studies contrasted nutritional values by restaurant types and found much higher calories and nutrients at full - service restaurants			1
’ less healthy : @entity5 was one of a handful of full - service restaurants found to be less healthy than @entity14 's when it comes to many menu items surprisingly unhealthy : @entity6 , like sister chain @entity5 , often had more calories per meal than are recommended on a daily basis also unhealthy : @entity7 friday 's was also found to be surprisingly unhealthy compared to @entity14 's the study also found few ‘ healthy choice ’ menu options at any of the chain restaurants			1
by comparison , a regular sized @entity77 value meal at @entity78 comes in at 920 calories , 12 grams of saturated fat and 1,130 milligrams of sodium , according the burger chain ’s website			0
researchers concluded that tighter portion controls contributed to less calories and sodium at fast food restaurants			2
there has not yet been conclusive research to show that people consistently alter their eating habits based on knowledge of how unhealthy food may or may not be			2
the conclusions should also be taken with a grain of salt			0
fast food is n’t necessarily healthier , it ’s just less unhealthy .			0

*multiple* full service restaurants were found to *possibly* be more unhealthy than @entity14 's
the finding showed calorie counts exceeding recommended daily totals in many instances
