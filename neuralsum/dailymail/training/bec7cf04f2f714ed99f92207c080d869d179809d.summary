@entity0 are a team who struggle for goals but do n’t concede any either - or so we were told			1
both of those statistics vanished at the @entity6 , the latter of which largely thanks to the mistakes of their captain , @entity10			0
it was his error that gifted @entity12 a place in the @entity14 at @entity15 in may , and the central defender suffered at @entity17 , his mishaps offering the hosts three points on a plate			1
@entity10 - at the bedrock of a back four to have kept three consecutive clean sheets before this - was caught a yard off @entity26 for the first goal and brought down the same man for the second during a game which raised questions over @entity0 ’s promotion credentials			1
off the mark : @entity26 ( left ) celebrates his first goal for @entity17 with skipper @entity34 the @entity35 were the pre-season smart money after the play - off final defeat but they have now endured an indifferent start , even with four points on the board			1
@entity42 had chosen to lament the fact his main men have been unable to find the net so far this season			0
their league tally stood at one - @entity50 ’s late winner against @entity51 on the opening day			2
a striking statistic , given this is the same side to have scored more than anyone else last season , even eventual champions @entity57			0
the problem at @entity17 was the disarray in which his back four was thrown with such ease			1
@entity10 and @entity63 looked uncomfortable for large parts			0
@entity17 : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 ( @entity71 89 ) , @entity34 , @entity72 , @entity73 ( @entity74 65 ) , @entity75 , @entity76 ( @entity77 45 ) subs not used : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 scorers : @entity26 11 , @entity72 ( pen 45 ) , @entity75 78 @entity0 : @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity10 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity50 ( best 77 ) , @entity90 , @entity91 ( @entity92 45 ) , @entity93 ( @entity94 69 ) , @entity95 subs not used : @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 scorer : @entity89 31 , 85 ref : @entity102 att : 15,317 ‘ you ca n’t win a game if you concede three goals like we did , ’ @entity42 said			1
‘ we reached such high levels last season that you expect to get back into the groove			2
’ it was n’t ideal , therefore , that they came up against a rejuvenated and revamped @entity17 here			2
for all the good groundwork laid by @entity115 - sacked in march - this the @entity116 are now a side insistent on playing a certain way under @entity119			1
they play with width and want to entertain			0
‘ this is the best i ’ve seen us play , ’ the manager said			0
‘ @entity0 did n’t have an answer			2
we were passing the ball very well			0
’ it helps having someone of @entity129 ’s quality operating as a heartbeat			0
a roaming wide midfielder capable of going short and long when need - be , the @entity132 cut is teeth at @entity136 and @entity137 as a teenager			0
it was he , now 23 and formerly of @entity140 , who sprayed a clever ball wide to @entity73 for the opening goal			0
@entity73 set about attacking @entity144 before crossing to @entity26 , who easily escaped @entity10 , span and smashed beyond @entity85			2
great effort : @entity89 ( being lifted up ) is over the moon with his spectacular equaliser , but @entity0 went onto lose @entity129 had already gone close earlier , but @entity0 found themselves level			1
@entity95 stung the palms of @entity65 , @entity50 kept the attack alive on the byline before laying back - via a super @entity90 step - over - to @entity89 , whose arrowed effort into the top corner was breathtakingly unstoppable			1
@entity90 went close as well as @entity156 but full league debutant @entity65 thwarted the pair			0
a head of steam was on its way , but they could n’t compensate for another uncharacteristic @entity10 gaffe , as he hauled @entity26 down in the box for @entity72 to convert a second seconds prior to the break			1
substitute @entity77 , who replaced the injured @entity26 , went close from @entity34 ’s clever cutback			0
that mattered little , though , with the points seemingly wrapped up 12 minutes from time			1
as @entity42 threw on targetman @entity168 , the impressive @entity75 was left all alone in the six - yard box to calmly nod into an empty net from @entity172 ’s centre			1
battle stations : @entity34 takes on @entity0 midfielder @entity50 @entity0 were offered a late lifeline they scarcely deserved after a dreadful @entity177 mistake - the goalkeeper allowing a tame @entity89 drive through his legs - but failed to capitalise on the obvious nerves swelling the ground			1
@entity119 , who refused to criticise his young no 2 , was buoyant - not quite as much as after the stoppage - time winner against @entity184 at the weekend - and already has this club , dormant only a matter of months ago , dreaming of a season much more profitable than the last			2
among the relegation favourites at the start of the month , @entity17 remain unbeaten			0
‘ never trust the bookies , ’ @entity119 smiled .			0

@entity26 gave @entity17 the lead with his first goal for the club
@entity89 got off the mark for the season to haul @entity0 level
@entity72 stepped up to give the @entity116 the lead again from the *penalty* spot
fellow @entity202 @entity75 made it 3 - 1 with 12 minutes remaining
@entity89 pulls one back late on but hosts hold on for the points
it *'s* the first goals play - off finalists @entity0 have conceded this season
@entity17 up to fourth in the championship
