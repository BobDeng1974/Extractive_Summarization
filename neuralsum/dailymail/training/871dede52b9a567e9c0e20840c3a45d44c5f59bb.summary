time to stop the moaning , louis @entity2 has spent the holidays moaning about the fixture list but i do n’t understand why he ’s so upset			1
when he came to the @entity6 he knew exactly what he was letting himself in for			2
festive football is one of the best things about our league			2
to arrive here and start complaining makes it look like he has n’t done his homework			2
@entity16 ran 7.4 miles against @entity17 , compared to 7.1 miles against @entity18 and @entity19 @entity20 manager @entity2 has seen his side draw their last three away games @entity20 's players look dejected as they fall behind to an early goal at @entity17 when he first made the comments after the @entity19 game , i thought @entity28 was joking			2
it was the first time in 85 games that @entity20 had named an unchanged line - up			1
he has rotated his squad more than anybody this season and then he starts kicking up a fuss about tiredness ? do me a favour			2
there are plenty of managers who would love to have the kind of options @entity28 has in his squad			2
he gets paid vast sums to figure out how to deal with situations like this			2
it ’s odd behaviour but it relays to the players and gives them a ready - made excuse not to perform			1
luckily for @entity28 , he still has some very willing runners in his team			2
four @entity20 players have played every minute since @entity56			2
but , as our table shows , rather than getting increasingly tired , they actually covered more miles on thursday than in any of their other games			2
more brilliance from @entity63 i 'm not going to lie			1
i was n’t happy seeing @entity63 score a late equaliser at @entity66			1
but i had a funny feeling he would do just that			2
@entity70 scored an absolute screamer , as our graphic shows , but @entity63 delivered yet again			1
@entity63 scores a stoppage time equaliser for @entity75 at @entity66 how @entity70 gave @entity66 the lead with his wonder strike in the first half he is one of the most - coveted centre forwards in football right now and with good reason			1
he is one of the best i ’ve seen at holding up the ball , he links so well and he has ice in his veins			0
he could play and prosper in any team			0
spurs hit @entity87 for a famous five on thursday we had the result of the season at @entity91			1
who saw @entity93 getting hammered 5 - 3 by @entity19 ? not me			1
it was their best performance for years to beat a team of @entity93 ’s quality , and scoring five goals , too			0
only one other team in history has put five past a @entity103 side — @entity104 when they beat @entity105 5 - 0 in 2010			1
make no mistake , this was a massive result			0
@entity108 scored twice as @entity19 hit @entity93 for five it was only the second time in @entity103 's managerial career one of his sides conceded five goals @entity93 have won nine out of nine at home but dropped 14 points on the road			1
it ’s a game that has blown the title race wide open and now you have to put @entity19 down as genuine top four contenders			1
@entity108 was unplayable and he terrorised a top defence			0
his work - rate inspires his team - mates and he is the difference for @entity19			1
for @entity125 , it ’s a great confidence boost			0
he looks like he could be the right man for the job and @entity19 fans will be looking forward to seeing what he can achieve with the right investment			0
for @entity87 , it ’s a huge blow			0
this was a shock and their away form is a real problem			0
@entity136 has a @entity137 what a miserable festive period it has been for @entity139			0
they have not lost four straight games since 2005 and have slipped down the table			0
@entity139 have lost their last four games and are slipping down the table @entity136 has seen @entity139 go through a miserable run over the festive period @entity136 is a good manager and i admire his attacking style			0
it ’s easy for people to say that makes them vulnerable but i did n’t hear any complaints about it last season			0
it ’s easy to blame systems but it ’s been a tough season and they look like they lack confidence			0
maybe it ’s time for the club to help @entity136 freshen up his squad			1
foxes are festive winners thursday felt like a big day at the bottom of the @entity6			0
@entity165 and @entity166 both came from behind to earn a draw and that late equaliser was a kick in the teeth for @entity66			0
it ’s still early days in the relegation fight and it ’s all still so tight - just six points separate the bottom seven sides			1
@entity165 came from behind to earn a draw at @entity176 @entity177 celebrates as @entity166 came from behind three times to earn a point at @entity18 but survival is is all about confidence			0
@entity166 have fought so hard and got good results and @entity183 stopped the rot			0
but with a win at @entity183 and rescuing a draw at @entity187 , @entity165 have been one of the biggest winners at the bottom this @entity137			0
could @entity191 be the difference ? @entity194 's incredible season goes on			1
another game , another goal			0
it ’s becoming a familiar story for @entity199			0
nobody saw the move coming , and people are keen to criticise @entity93 for letting him go			0
but , in fairness , you ca n’t say the decision has weakened their team			0
where it is starting to hurt them is in the table			0
@entity194 celebrates his second half winner against @entity213 thursday ’s winner was the latest in a long line of key goals for @entity199 , and the tables below show how important he has become			1
if you take away @entity191 ’s goals , @entity199 would be seven points off the pace			0
with them , they are dead level and bang in the title race			1
2 - @entity165 should be proud of their comeback at @entity187			1
only twice before in the @entity6 have @entity176 surrendered a two - goal lead at @entity187 to draw			1
it happened twice in september 2002 — first in a 2 - 2 draw with @entity18 and then a 2 - 2 draw with @entity229 a week later			1
strangely , their last result before those games was a 2 - 2 draw away at @entity233			1
3 - given his goal - scoring record , it may come as some surprise that this is the first time @entity239 has scored in three consecutive @entity6 games			1
53 - he might not be a creative playmaker , but @entity243 now has 53 assists in the @entity6 , the same number as @entity246			1
33 - let 's hope the @entity6 has started 2015 as it means to go on			1
there were 33 goals scored on thursday , the most on @entity250 in the @entity6 and the most since 34 went in on january 1 , 1987			0
77 - @entity252 ’s red card completed a miserable afternoon for @entity139			1
they now have 77 @entity6 reds — more than any other team			0
653 - after seven goals in his first nine @entity6 games this season , @entity256 finally ended a goal - drought of 653 minutes against @entity261			1
his last was against @entity263 in october			0
11 - @entity264 have scored just 11 goals so far this season			2
only two sides in @entity6 history have scored fewer goals after 20 games — @entity199 and @entity271 both scored 10 in 1995 - 96 and 2007 - 08 respectively .			2

@entity63 showed why he is one of the most - coveted strikers around
@entity103 was hit for five for only the second time in his career
@entity194 proves he could be the difference in the title race
