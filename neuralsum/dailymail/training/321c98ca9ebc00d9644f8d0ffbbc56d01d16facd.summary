the retired judge leading an inquiry into historic sex abuse said she will not quit yesterday , after her brother was linked to an establishment ‘ cover - up ’ of the paedophile ring she will be investigating			1
@entity7 faced demands for her resignation less than 24 hours after she was appointed to lead the government ’s probe into abuse by politicians and other powerful figures			1
mps and legal experts said it was inappropriate for her to keep the post given that her late brother , sir @entity19 , was attorney general under @entity20 when many of the abuse claims were first made			1
actor @entity36 , sir @entity19 ’s son , defended his aunt yesterday			1
he said she ‘ had no political ties to my father and knew nothing about what was going on in the @entity42 at that time ’ , adding : ‘ she has every right to lead the inquiry			2
’ but @entity47 mp @entity46 , who exposed @entity49 ’s abuse and led calls for a full inquiry into the alleged official cover - up of child abuse , said : ‘ it ’s astonishing the government did n’t realise they were appointing the sister of someone who had tried to deter the prosecution of a significant paedophile			1
it ’s far too @entity61 – and the government need to think again			0
’ further doubt was cast on @entity7 ’s suitability last night when it emerged she had made significant errors in an inquiry into a @entity68 paedophile scandal three years ago			1
eight months after her report was published , the peer had to issue a six - page addendum in which she apologised for ‘ inaccuracies ’ that arose from her failure to corroborate information provided by senior @entity68 figures			2
mps and legal experts said it was inappropriate for her to keep the post given that her late brother , sir @entity19 , was attorney general under @entity20 when many of the abuse claims were first made mr @entity46 said the mistakes ‘ raise more concerns ’ about her ability to lead an inquiry into failures by @entity87 , @entity32 , the @entity88 , @entity68 and other public bodies to protect children from abuse			1
@entity93 , a lawyer who has represented many victims of child abuse , added : ‘ the concern is that she is just too close to the @entity61 and in particular , [ there is ] concern over her connection to sir @entity19			1
’ however , @entity7 – who also headed the @entity102 inquiry into false accusations of child abuse – said yesterday : ‘ if people think i am not suitable then that ’s up to them			1
’ @entity32 sources insisted the allegations relating to sir @entity19 had been considered before her appointment was announced			1
a @entity110 spokesman said : ‘ she commands the very highest respect for her professional expertise and integrity			2
’ @entity47 mp @entity46 , who exposed @entity49 's abuse and led calls for a full inquiry into the alleged official cover - up of child abuse , said : ' it 's astonishing the @entity55 did n't realise they were appointing the sister of someone who had tried to deter the prosecution of a significant paedophile ' last week the @entity123 reported the story of sir @entity125 , the deputy under - secretary of state at the @entity126 , who was also believed to be a senior officer in @entity34			1
in 1978 , @entity125 – a subscriber to the notorious @entity128 – was caught sending and receiving obscene literature through the post after a package was found on a @entity133 bus			0
he was named in a report submitted by the @entity135 to the @entity136 – but never prosecuted			0
mr @entity28 used parliamentary privilege to name @entity125 and asked sir @entity19 if he would prosecute him			1
in a written answer , sir @entity19 replied that he agreed with the @entity136 that there was no need to do so			1
mr @entity28 called his decision the ‘ cover - up of the century ’			1
n @entity143 yesterday backed the @entity145 ’s demand for new laws to make it an offence not to report child abuse in a children ’s home , hospital or boarding school			2
the charity ’s proposed rules would , however , be limited to so - called closed institutions , where children stay overnight			2
a whistleblower has accused the @entity159 of giving tens of thousands of pounds of public money directly to the @entity128			0
former civil servant @entity161 said the payments were made to the group at the request of the @entity135 ’s @entity165			0
his comments cast doubts on the credibility of an internal @entity159 inquiry this week that found it did not give any grants directly to @entity128 , which wanted to decriminalise sex between children and adults			0
former civil servant @entity161 has accused the @entity159 of giving tens of thousands of pounds of public money directly to the @entity128 the report found that while two groups linked to @entity128 received almost £ 500,000 from the @entity159 , the paedophile group itself did not get any cash			0
but mr @entity161 believes paperwork that could prove grants were paid straight to @entity128 may be among 114 files relating to child sex abuse lost by the @entity159			0
breaking 35 years of silence , he said he had raised concerns with @entity186 , his boss at the @entity187 at the @entity159 , when asked to renew a grant in 1979 for @entity128 , thought to have been worth around £ 30,000			0
he told @entity189 he went to mr @entity186 and said : ‘ look , @entity186 , what the hell are we doing funding an organisation like @entity128 ? ’ he added : ‘ i had young children and @entity128 were openly campaigning for the reduction of the age of consent to four			2
‘ secondly , it seemed crazy that we should be funding an organisation that was advocating a lessening of the constraints around child abuse when one of our constituent organisations was the @entity205 , which was spending a lot of money to prevent child abuse			2
‘ i remember having a frank exchange with him about this and his arguments [ for continuing payments ] were , one , it was recognised as a legitimate if not necessarily appropriate campaigning organisation			0
secondly , i have a very clear recollection that he told me it was being funded at the request of @entity165			0
’ he said mr @entity186 ordered the grant to be paid			0
but the fact that it was a renewal suggests money had also been paid by the @entity47 government of @entity223 , which left office in 1979			0
it is not known why @entity165 would request the payment , although suspicions have been raised that undercover officers were trying to infiltrate the group to find prominent members who could be blackmailed .			0
