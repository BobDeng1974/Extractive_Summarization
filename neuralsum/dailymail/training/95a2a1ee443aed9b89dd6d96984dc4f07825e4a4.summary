the wheelchair , similar to the one above , was instead taken by his wife to bail after she forked out $ 700 for another flight ' the airline ’s response was no , that even without the battery – which had originally been used as the reason the chair could not travel on the airline – it would not be allowed in the cargo hold , ' he told @entity53			1
mr @entity4 also said the size of the chair was not an issue as it could be folded down to a size that was ' not much bigger than a suitcase '			0
furthermore , when asked if he could use one of the airline 's airport wheelchairs to transport him to his @entity7 hotel , he was also told ' no '			0
