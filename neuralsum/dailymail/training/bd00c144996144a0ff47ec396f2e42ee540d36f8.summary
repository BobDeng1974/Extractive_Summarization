for @entity4 is believed to be launching an @entity5 next month , and now fansite @entity6 claims to have photographed the eight - inch evolution of the @entity5			2
@entity4 is notoriously secretive on the run - up to new launches , but leaks from within the industry , including from suppliers and partners , have all but confirmed the device is on its way this @entity16			2
almost ready for prime time ? @entity18 revealed these images of the alleged eight - inch @entity5 , due to launch on october 17 the @entity20 is believed to sport an eight - inch screen , making it a shrunken version of the @entity5 's ten - inches			1
this will allow a higher degree of portability over previous models , and also give @entity4 the ammunition to compete with @entity29 , which recently brought out a seven - inch range of @entity32 tablets			1
@entity18 also reports this is a 3g - capable model , meaning you can use data on the go			0
while @entity41 was famously against smaller @entity42 , the success of the @entity32 and @entity39 's ' fire ' of budget tablets appears to have convinced @entity4 there is a market for the slim - line device			1
rumours from @entity4 suppliers suggest the innards of the @entity49 will be equivalent to an ipad 2 , which analysts suggest will be more than enough to power the shrunken device			0
the third @entity5 had a specification increase but also increased slightly in weight due to the demands of the high - definition @entity56			0

' i donâ € ™ t think @entity4 would want reviews of both a new @entity67 and new - size @entity5 appearing at the same time , ' said @entity78 's @entity77			0
' why share the spotlight ? why have another @entity4 product battling with the @entity67 for the top spots in news coverage ? ' the more i think about it , the less sense it makes for the @entity67 to even share the stage at the announcement with any other product			0
' the @entity67 is too big , too cool and garners too much attention - and it 's in @entity4 's interest to keep that attention undiluted			0
