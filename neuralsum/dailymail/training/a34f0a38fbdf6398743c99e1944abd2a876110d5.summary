by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 15:17 est , 8 december 2012 @entity2 children in the township of @entity4 , in south - eastern @entity5 , pictured despite being shunned as disruptive outsiders across huge swathes of the continent gypsies have @entity11 roots stretching more than a millennium ago , research has found			1
the @entity2 , @entity11 's largest minority group with approximately 11 million people , speak a mosaic of languages and practice different religions and lifestyle - but all share a common if complex past			1
genetic scientists have now found they began their migration into @entity11 1,500 years ago , much earlier than previously thought , from a single population in northern @entity24			1
despite their beginnings the size of the @entity2 population now rivals that of several countries , including @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32			1
they first arrived through the @entity34 and began dispersing outwards from there 900 years ago , the team found			0
they first arrived in the @entity37 in 1513 , the team believe			0
professor @entity38 , of the @entity39 at @entity40 in @entity41 , said : ' we were interested in exploring the population history of @entity44 because they constitute an important fraction of the @entity11 population , but their marginalised situation in many countries also seems to have affected their visibility in scientific studies			1
' the graph shows the @entity2 population throughout @entity11			1
the blue numbers indicate when the communities are thought to have settled in the country the @entity44 people lack written historical records on their origins and dispersal so the team gathered genome - wide data from 13 romani groups collected across @entity11 to confirm an @entity24 origin for @entity44 , consistent with earlier linguistic studies			1
@entity67 @entity69 's series followed those marrying @entity2 - style in @entity71 had audiences of 7 million , and spawned spinoffs including @entity75 's gypsy girls which was criticised by the stars for making them look ' tarty and stupid '			2
snatch @entity79 's 2000 blockbuster set in @entity81 's east end starred @entity82 as @entity85 gypsy @entity83 , a bare - knuckle boxing champion who dupes the gangsters who find his camp deserted when they go to avenge him			0
and the violins stopped playing the 1988 film follows a small group of gypsies escaping the @entity93 's during @entity94 the group , including south from @entity96 through @entity97 and @entity98			2
the study in journal @entity100 offers the first genome - wide perspective on @entity2 origins and demographic history			0
the authors claim that their findings could have implications for various disciplines including human evolution and health sciences			2
' from a genome - wide perspective , @entity44 people share a common and unique history that consists of two elements - the roots in northwestern @entity24 and the admixture with @entity118 @entity11 accumulating with different magnitudes during the out - of - @entity24 migration across @entity11 , ' co-author professor @entity121 from @entity122 in the @entity123 said			1
' our study clearly illustrates that understanding the @entity2 's genetic legacy is necessary to complete the genetic characterisation of @entity11 as a whole , with implications for various fields , from human evolution to the health sciences			1
' in the @entity37 gypsies were originally thought to have come from @entity133 and early @entity11 references describe wandering , nomadic communities who were known for their music and skill with horses			2
the earliest references to gypsies come from @entity41 in the 15th century			0
they are traditionally thought of as nomadic groups and have suffered centuries of discrimination , including extermination by some 20th - century fascist regimes including @entity148 and @entity149			0
campaign groups the @entity151 in @entity98 say that the persecution and discrimination is still rife against the group which are now found to have settled in the sixth century			0
@entity155 , chairman of the board of the @entity151 , said : ' i think @entity2 has been discriminated against in @entity11 almost since their arrival and they continue to suffer discrimination and structural poverty throughout @entity11 today			1
' the vast majority of them are now settled			0
there are of course a great number of migrants but it is a different phenomenon , these are people seeking better lives because of discrimination , they 're looking for jobs , looking for places to put their children through school			0
@entity173 with her groom @entity174 and bridesmaids , pictured , featured in @entity69 series @entity67 when they wed the in small @entity85 town of @entity179 - the spiritual home of @entity85 travellers ' i think regardless of how long they have been in @entity11 the problems of discrimination and poverty should be addressed			2
' in some countries @entity2 will compromise 25 per cent of the work force in the near future so for a whole number of reasons - economic , moral , and for legal obligations to human rights - the discrimination should be addressed			0
' despite their longstanding roots the communities are still segregated and subjected to ' hate speech ' even by public figures , mr @entity155 said			0
the communities have recently been targeted both in @entity199 , during @entity201 's presidency , and @entity202 , under @entity203 , and suffered from forced evictions			0
but despite their persecution gypsys ' have had a major influence on @entity11 culture including influencing @entity210 dancing			1
mr @entity155 said : ' we see their influence on many forms of culture			2

romani population rivals that of several countries including @entity30
the community has had an influence on @entity11 culture
they are still ' discriminated ' against across @entity11
