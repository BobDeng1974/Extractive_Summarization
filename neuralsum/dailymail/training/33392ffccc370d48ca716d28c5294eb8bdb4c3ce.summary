by @entity0 published : 10:32 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 10:23 est , 29 june 2012 a female reporter covering a murder trial was ordered out of court after turning up in gold sequinned ' disco pants '			0
@entity6 's ejection from @entity8 @entity7 in @entity9 sparked an online debate over the rights and wrongs of wearing the trousers in court			1
some posters claimed telling her to leave court was sexist considering there is no formal dress code and jeans are allowed			1
eye - catching : @entity6 ( above left ) was asked to leave @entity8 @entity7 in @entity9 for wearing ' tight ' and ' bedazzled ' gold trousers ( right ) a registrar at @entity24 approached @entity25 , 25 , who works for @entity26 , while she was sitting in an area reserved for media and asked her to leave before the hearing broke for lunch			1
afterwards , miss @entity6 , who describes herself on her @entity33 page as ' winner , @entity34 , 25 years running ' , took to the site to defend the trousers , saying : ' i 'm sitting under a table ! no one even sees my legs ! ' when quizzed as to whether they were actually pants , she said they were , ' just tight and stretchy and bedazzled '			1
bemused : @entity6 ( pictured ) was ordered out of court for her trousers , but said she could not see what the fuss was all about she added : ' i do n't know why people are acting like they 've never seen sequinned pants before			1
' according to a faq section of the @entity9 's @entity52 website , there is ' no strict dress code bur smart casual dress is preferred '			1
the advice , provided for people doing jury service , adds : ' you will be sitting down for a long time , so wear clothes you feel comfortable in			0
' among people who backed the court ejection , @entity60 said on @entity63 : ' it 's a murder trial in the @entity7 , not fashion week			2
' a high standard of dress is expected - even from journos			2
' another person remarked : ' at the very least she should have been arrested for a crime against fashion			0
' a poster using the name @entity73 said : ' if the younger generation ca n't see what â€™s wrong with wearing disco pants to the @entity7 or a ski jacket to parliament then i honestly fear for this country and its future			0
' ejected : a registrar at @entity24 ( pictured ) told @entity6 to leave a murder trial due to her attire however , @entity86 felt miss @entity6 had been dealt a harsh hand			1
' well , in my view there should be a ( reasonably high ) standard of dress required			0
' but if a man is allowed in jeans , then she should be allowed in those			2
' a person going under the name @entity97 said the decision was ' quite clearly sexist '			0
they added : ' surely the test should be whether the young lady was competent at her job and exhibited proper , correct and polite behaviour towards others			0
' @entity9 broadcaster @entity106 also backed miss @entity6			2
she said : ' i got kicked out of court and an official warning when i wore a white sundress and got caught in the rain			0

@entity6 was asked to leave even though there is no formal dress code and jeans are allowed
