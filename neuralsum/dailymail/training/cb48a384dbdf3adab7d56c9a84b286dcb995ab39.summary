by political reporter last updated at 3:09 pm on 6th february 2012 @entity2 @entity1 last night urged @entity3 to seize back from @entity4 up to 130 powers over crime and policing			0
in a show of strength , more than 100 conservative mps have written to the prime minister urging him to return control over a range of contentious crime measures to @entity15			0

pressure : @entity3 , left , was urged to give more control back to @entity15 by @entity1 including cabinet minister @entity24 , right the letter , signed by former cabinet ministers @entity24 and @entity27 and the current chairman of the party ’s powerful @entity29 , @entity28 , warns that @entity31 has just two years to ‘ opt out ’ of the measures before they become irreversible			1
powers at stake include the @entity36 , which has seen more than 200 @entity31 nationals handed over to prosecutors in other @entity40 states			1
use of the power has brought accusations of false arrest , alarmed civil liberties groups and led to warnings that it is a major step towards establishing a single @entity19 prosecutor			2
@entity1 are also demanding action to remove the @entity31 from a requirement that police share dna and fingerprint data with other @entity19 police forces – another measure that has alarmed civil liberties campaigners			1

the pragmatic thing would be to opt out of the lot			0
we can always opt in at a later date because it is the right thing to do for @entity31			0
’ mr @entity57 added : ‘ the last thing the @entity31 needs is the @entity101 in @entity86 doing for @entity31 crime and policing what the @entity104 court has done for human rights			0
’ ¿ we do not want to see @entity31 police forces subjected to mandatory demands by @entity19 police under the @entity75 , says the letter to the prime minister			1
