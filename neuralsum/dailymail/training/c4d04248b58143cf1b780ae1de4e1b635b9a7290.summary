by @entity0 , deputy political editor published : 05:27 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 20:08 est , 28 march 2013 @entity1 is to move to @entity2 to act as a ' parliamentary greybeard ' for the pm @entity5 moved to build bridges with his backbenchers yesterday by appointing a right - winger to be his eyes and ears in @entity11			1
energy minister @entity1 – who has battled with the @entity12 over windfarms – become a cabinet office minister			1
as mr @entity5 ’s senior parliamentary adviser , mr @entity1 , a flamboyant and popular right - wing veteran , will channel concerns from mps to the prime minister			1
it is a role last carried out by @entity20 when the @entity21 were in opposition			1
mr @entity1 ’s surprise appointment follows mutterings about a potential @entity26 leadership challenge and complaints from ministers about an increasingly rebellious parliamentary party			1
his energy responsibilities will pass to business minister @entity31 , one of the @entity21 ’ toughest ministers			1
the move comes on the day the @entity35 magazine reported that cabinet ministers believe 25 mps have written to @entity38 , chairman of the @entity39 demanding a leadership election			2
the rebels would need 46 to prompt a vote			0
mr @entity38 refused to comment on the claims			0
mr @entity1 ’s appointment is an admission that mr @entity5 and his circle of aides have failed to engage productively with a growing section of his party			2
mr @entity1 proved a controversial energy minister , when he ruled out any more onshore wind farms , declaring ' enough is enough ' the move is seen as a pre-emptive measure by mr @entity5 ahead of difficult local elections in may , where the @entity21 are expected to lose hundreds of council seats to labour and the @entity58 @entity57			1
allies of backbencher @entity60 have been openly advancing his leadership prospects and home secretary @entity62 is also putting a campaign together in private			0
both say they would not challenge mr @entity5 , but his aides admit they need to raise their game			0
the prime minister took to @entity69 to say he was ' delighted ' by the shake up to his team business minister @entity31 adds energy to his responsibilities , as @entity5 moves to strengthen his team 's links with the @entity26 backbenches @entity1 @entity1 could not be more different to the privileged elite who are said to dominate the upper echelons of the @entity26 party			1
@entity81 , union member , antiques collector , jam maker : he is one of a handful of working class , grammar school - educated conservative ministers in the government			1
he has strong views on almost everything , from gay marriage and most famously wind farms to the right way to decorate a @entity95 cake			0
( i just think real icing is very important			0
) the son of a power station worker , he grew up on a council estate in south east @entity101 and is ' very proud ' of his working class roots			1
in @entity103 he lists his interests as : ' the arts ( particularly @entity107 painting , poetry and prose ) , good food and wine , many sports ( including darts and boxing ) , gardening , making jam , antiques , architecture , aesthetics			0
' a former county councillor in @entity121 , he was elected as mp for @entity123 and the @entity124 in @entity125 in 1997			0
within two years @entity126 appointed him as vice-chairman of the @entity26 party , responsible for campaigning before becoming shadow schools minister in 2000 and served on the opposition frontbench for @entity131 , for whom he was once a speech writer , @entity132 and later @entity5			1
however , he was also an outspoken critic of mr @entity5 's style in the early days of the leadership			0
in 2006 he dismissed plans for an a-list of high - flying @entity26 candidates ' a bizarre theory of people who spend too much time with the pseuds and posers of @entity101 's chi - chi set and not enough time in normal @entity58 '			2
he is chairman of the @entity144 of traditional conservatives , whose motto is ' faith , flag and family '			0
his rise through the political ranks passed almost unnoticed until last year he declared war on wind farms , and gained a reputation for speaking for many @entity26 backbenchers who felt @entity156 was not listening to their concerns			1
‘ do we want to strengthen our relations with the parliamentary party ? of course we do , ’ said a @entity156 source			1
‘ @entity1 ’s going to be a massive asset			2
’ mr @entity1 is a founder member of the @entity144 of socially conservative @entity21 and will be expected to calm anger on that wing of the party about mr @entity5 ’s support for gay marriage			1
whether he can also get @entity168 and @entity169 demanding tax cuts back on board remains to be seen			0
one minister who is close to mr @entity5 said of mr @entity1 : ‘ we ’ve needed someone like that for a long time			1
@entity1 reaches parts of the party that others do not reach			2
it shows the pm is aware that he needs to do more to keep @entity181 in the loop			0
’ mr @entity1 becomes a minister of state without portfolio in the @entity184 and has been appointed to the @entity185			1
but some @entity181 said it will take more than his appointment to repair relations with the party			0
the @entity21 would be neck and neck with @entity193 if @entity194 replaced mr @entity5 as leader , a poll revealed			2
the @entity197 survey put @entity193 ’s lead at six points , on 37 per cent to the @entity21 ’ 31			2
but when voters are asked how they would vote if the mayor of @entity101 was @entity26 leader , the parties are tied on 37 per cent			1
crucially , a @entity194 leadership would lure a third of @entity206 voters to the @entity21			2
business minister @entity31 adds energy to his brief @entity31 has been brought in to give the @entity209 a ‘ business mindset ’ and calm tensions about wind farms and rising fuel bills			1
anti-turbine campaigners will be cheered by his remarks yesterday that he would concentrate on nuclear power , oil , gas , and offshore wind			0
but he failed to mention the controversial topic of onshore windfarms			0
party sources understand he is ‘ very aware ’ of concerns about the impact of turbines on the landscape			0
they say that , while he will back the growth of green industries , he will take a ‘ very robust ’ approach to attempts to overburden other sectors of the economy with environmental taxes and rules			0
mr @entity31 , a rising star of the conservative party , is renowned for driving projects through			2
his brief is to help the @entity238 attract the £ 110billion of private sector investment it desperately needs for new energy generation , particularly in nuclear power stations			0
fears are growing that failure to do so could see further increases in electricity bills and even blackouts			0
there are tensions between his new boss , @entity12 energy secretary @entity250 , who wants to build up the renewable energy sector , and the @entity252 which says this would burden other sectors with green taxes and regulations			0
mr @entity31 has been urged to stand up to @entity12 and @entity258 ministers who want to increase the target for the amount of energy which must come from ‘ green ’ sources – currently 15 per cent by 2020			2
mr @entity31 will retain his role as a business minister .			1

@entity26 will move from energy to new role as senior advisor to *no.* 10
business minister @entity31 adds energy to his brief
move is designed to *rebuild* relations between @entity156 and disaffected backbenchers
@entity1 has warned the @entity21 must win back working class voters
