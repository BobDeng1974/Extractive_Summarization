while waxing and grooming of pubic hair has long been de rigueur , the increasing popularity of labioplasty and other cosmetic procedures for women 's private parts suggests that the appearance of the nether regions is becoming something of an obsession for appearance - concious women			2
however the latest product to hit the market aimed at the transformation of ' greying ' feminine areas may be a step too far for some			0
my new @entity19 is a cosmetic genital dye that claims to be able to restore women 's labia to a ' youthful pink '			1
my new @entity19 is a temporary genital dye designed to correct ' greying ' and restore a ' youthful pink ' to a woman 's nether regions available to buy on @entity33 for £ 23 ( $ 36.95 ) , my new @entity19 comes in four shades , ' @entity31 ' , ' @entity30 ' , ' @entity29 ' and ' @entity32 ' all packaged in a @entity36 - style tin			1
the dye is temporary and is applied with an applicator to the area where it takes effect immediately			1
while one may question where the idea for such a product came from , the website states that the ' patent pending formula ' was designed by a certified @entity47 after she discovered her own genital colour loss			2
while looking online for a solution the website says she discovered ' thousands of other women ' asking the same questions regarding their colour loss			0
after much research she could unearth no solution and , after a discussion with her gynecologist , she decided to create her own			0
' now there 's a solution ! ' the website crows , as if it were they had found the answer to some question we 'd all been asking			0
each so - called @entity66 includes 20 disposable applicators , a mixing dish , the labia colourant and an instructional guide			0
the four shades of dye mean you can pick the level and intensity of change - ranging from @entity30 at the lighter end to @entity32 at the darkest			1
three of the four shades are currently out of stock on the website , with only ' @entity31 ' still available each @entity66 includes 20 disposable applicators , mixing dish , the labia colorant dye of your choice and an instructional guide the darkest shade is described as for the ' woman who wants to be daring ' to give a ' bold burgundy pink colour '			1
' perfect for everyone , and your own base colour will determine the depth of this shade			0
tonight it 's show time ! ! ' the website states			0
however for those less willing to make a statement with their lady - parts there is @entity30 ' for beginners '			2
many of the top rated customer comments are decidedly tongue - in - cheek @entity30 is described as perfect for those ' who want to make a slight , fresh colour change in their appearance or those who are very fair skinned ' while @entity29 prompts a more exciting description			1
the website says : ' think of that favourite lipstick you wear for those dressy black tie affairs and think " @entity29 "			2
this shade blends with a woman 's own skin tones to bring out that " sexy hot pink , i am fired up , look "			0
go dancing this weekend and remember to bring " @entity29 " along ! ' but those who have discovered the product for sale on @entity33 have had mixed reactions , with most of the top rated customer reviews taking a slightly tongue - in - cheek attitude to the existence of @entity130			1
despite the understandable cynicism surround the necessity of labia dye , nearly all the shades of the dye have sold out , with only two pots of ' @entity31 ' remaining in stock .			1
