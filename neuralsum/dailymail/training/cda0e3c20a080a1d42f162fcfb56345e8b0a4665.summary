an inquest heard today that a pathologist ’s post mortem results came back negative but that the most likely cause of the youngster ’s death was an electrical conduction problem of the heart			1
the hearing was told how @entity2 ’s mother @entity22 had returned from work to their home in @entity26 , @entity27 , around 4pm after being unable to contact her daughter			1
her fears were allayed when she found her younger daughter @entity30 there who told her mum that @entity2 was in the shower and that she had left a note			1

after calling for help her neighbour , retired teacher @entity44 , came to her aid and began cpr until the ambulance crew arrived			0
@entity2 was taken to @entity49 , where she was pronounced dead less than 90 minutes after she was found in the bath			2
the most likely cause of death according to pathologist dr @entity52 was sudden cardiac death , possibly caused by an electrical conduction problem of the heart			1
