dramatic pictures taken by a passenger show the casing ripped back to reveal the inner workings of one of the engines of the @entity16			2

the crew were able to land safely , and the aircraft is currently being examined by technicians			0
it is not clear what caused the casing , which is part of the engine cowling , to burst open , but aircraft experts said it is possible to continue to fly without it			2
a @entity5 spokesman said the crew had been following standard procedure when they made the decision to return after noticing the vibrations			0
' these fellows did the right thing by immediately landing even though they knew there was no major danger , ' @entity54 , chief executive of @entity55 , told @entity60			2
