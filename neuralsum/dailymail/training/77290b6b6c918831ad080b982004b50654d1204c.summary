@entity0 , pictured , claimed that he was gay moments before he due to be deported to @entity2 a violent father - of - two escaped deportation moments before being put on a plane to @entity2 – by suddenly declaring he was homosexual			1
@entity0 , 55 , was ordered to be sent back to his @entity2 homeland after building up a long criminal record including thefts , drug possession , and assaults			2
yet at the last moment , while he was in handcuffs in a van at @entity13 , he announced that he was gay and claimed he could not be sent to @entity2 because he could face discrimination there			1
this claim halted his deportation in its tracks			0
and even though a hearing subsequently ruled it would have been lawful to send him home , as home secretary @entity20 wished , he has now won the right to remain			1
two immigration judges have ruled that his human right to a family life is more important than the government ’s wish to protect the public from him			0
conservative mp @entity28 said : ‘ this case perfectly shows how the law is an ass			0
we must be a complete laughing stock			0
’ asked about claims that he was not really gay , @entity0 told @entity34 : ‘ i had a right			2
’ mrs may spent thousands of pounds of public money to remove @entity0 from @entity38			2
@entity0 , of @entity39 , @entity40 , was 13 when he came to @entity38			1
he has 18 convictions for theft , three for possession of drugs , and four for assault			2
in 1993 he was jailed for seven years for robbery , and ten years ago he received a 12 - month sentence for theft and threatening behaviour			2
then , in 2009 , after he was jailed for a street attack , the @entity50 ordered that he should be sent to @entity2			0
@entity0 immediately began using human rights laws – and his right to a family life – to contest the deportation , but all his appeals failed			1
in march 2011 , mrs may signed his deportation order			1
it was shortly afterwards , as he was on his way to the plane , that he made his gay claim			0
police immediately turned round and returned to a police station			1
a series of further hearings followed , and judges have now ruled he is free to remain			0
there has been growing concern about the way criminals and failed asylum seekers defeat deportation orders by using the clause of the @entity75 guaranteeing a right to a family life			0
claims that the deportee will face discrimination or violence in their homeland are also often accepted by courts , despite scepticism by others			0
home secretary @entity20 , pictured , signed @entity0 's deportation order in march 2011			1

@entity0 has 18 convictions and was told he must return to @entity2
@entity0 , who arrived in @entity38 aged 13 used human rights laws to remain
home secretary @entity20 signed a deportation order in march 2011
@entity0 , *56* , told police he was gay as he was *approaching* @entity13 *airport*
the father - of - two was returned to a police station for a further hearing
now the thug , who served seven years for robbery in 1993 , is free to remain
