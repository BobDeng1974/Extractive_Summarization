@entity1 manager @entity0 has not spoken to @entity3 boss @entity2 about the fitness of striker @entity5 ahead of his squad announcement for the matches against @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity1 play @entity8 in a @entity11 qualifier on november 15 before facing @entity9 in a friendly match three days later			1
@entity13 forward @entity5 , who has been sidelined since early september with a thigh injury suffered on @entity1 duty and a calf problem before his club comeback , has travelled to @entity19 with @entity3 for their @entity21 clash with @entity22			1
@entity3 ace @entity5 has been out of action since picking up a thigh injury @entity0 plans to hold talks with @entity2 over the possibility of calling up @entity5 the 25 - year - old is not expected to play and @entity1 boss @entity0 revealed he still has to check with @entity2 about the striker 's fitness before including him in the squad			1
when asked if he had spoken to @entity2 , @entity0 told @entity31 : ' no not at the moment but i have it in mind to do so of course			2
' i was waiting to see what the situation would be with him ( @entity5 )			2
it 's very good news to hear that he 's travelled but of course before i select him again i would check with the player and the club that we were doing the right thing			0
' while @entity5 's fitness still has a question mark over it , @entity45 welcomed back fellow @entity1 star @entity49 after a long - term injury			1
the @entity1 boss could also call up @entity45 winger @entity49 following his return from injury @entity49 missed the @entity54 after being ruled out for nine months with a knee injury @entity49 missed out on the @entity54 in @entity56 after suffering a cruciate knee injury in january but came off the bench to play a cameo role in the @entity61 ' 3 - 0 win over @entity62 at the weekend			1
@entity0 was playing his cards close to his chest ahead of the squad announcement , but admitted that any @entity67 player who is fit could come into the reckoning			2
' all players who are @entity67 and who have any ability are in my thoughts , ' @entity0 said			0
' it 's very rare that there would be an @entity67 player who 's got any ability and is available to play for @entity1 and has n't retired are in our thoughts			0
' @entity80 [ @entity81 ] has never been a problem in that regard and neither have the other managers for that matter			0
' i 've been very fortunate in that normally when players are fit and able to come with the national team , the managers are very good at allowing them or accepting that they are going to come without any complaint			0
' it 's nice of course when a manager like @entity80 goes out and has a player that 's been out for a long , long time and says that if we want to select him we can			0

@entity0 is *contemplating* whether to call up @entity5
@entity5 has been *struggling* with fitness since picking up a thigh injury on *international* duty
