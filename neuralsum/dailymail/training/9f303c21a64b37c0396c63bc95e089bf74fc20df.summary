the spectacular @entity3 lasted around two hours and @entity7 described the colourful display as ' unreal ' the software engineer 's fascinating photos show the green , purple and orange glows reflecting off the surface of the glacial lake the glow from the @entity50 lava field eruption was located about 50 miles from the @entity19 glacial lake in south - east @entity2 ' i just felt at one with nature and completely forgot everything else			1
every time i see them i 'm wondering what the people in the old days felt when they did n't know what these lights are			0

the @entity17 lava field eruption began last summer and is the largest to occur in @entity2 since the @entity70 eruption from 1783 - 1784 @entity7 bought a professional dslr camera and lens to get the most out of his photos of the @entity3 over @entity2 he said : ' most of the time you can not see the purple colour with your naked eye			1
but when they are really strong you can see the purple , pink and red colours with your eyes			0
' but then they are too bright to take good pictures because the foreground objects gets too dark - depending whether it is full moon or not			2
' it all depends very much on the strength of the sun activity			0
currently the sun activity is on a maximum and will decrease over the next few years			0
' i hope that one day i earn enough money just with my photography to be able to travel around the world and capture all the beauties of our wonderful planet			0
