when tubs the @entity1 refused to take milk or formula from a bottle , it seemed the puppy was unlikely to survive			1
the animal was the runt of a litter left as orphans when their mother died , and taken in by a @entity13 woman			1
but when he was just an hour from death , the woman saved the puppy 's life â€“ by breastfeeding it herself			2
feeding time : a @entity13 woman saved the life of @entity2 the @entity1 after he refused to take milk or formula from a bottle - by breastfeeding the puppy herself			1
above , @entity2 latches on to the breast of the woman ' you could call it a maternal instinct ' : the woman - who wishes to remain unnamed - said the animal had been the smallest of the litter of mixed - breed labradors that she had fostered following the death of their mother ' he was n't moving and i just did it			1
i did n't know what else to do			0
i was desperate and i just could n't bear sitting there watching him die , ' the mother - of - one told @entity47			0
' i guess you could call it , in a sense , like a maternal instinct			0
' the unnamed woman - who has a 15 - month - old child - said the puppy had been the smallest of the litter of mixed - breed labradors that she had fostered following the death of their mother			1
she confessed she had felt ' weird ' about breastfeeding the animal - but that the notion had just ' clicked ' in her head			0
warning : veterinarian @entity63 has warned of the risks posed by breastfeeding animals like puppies ' i thought " just put him on you and pray to @entity71 that he 'll take something and not die " , ' said the woman , who later posted a photo of herself breastfeeding the puppy on @entity76			1
and her actions appear to have saved the puppy 's life - with the animal now weaned off breast milk and taking formula			2
it is also no longer the runt of the litter , and has even grown larger than some of its siblings - earning it the nickname ' @entity2 '			2
' i 've seen the results			0
that dog is alive because i took the initiative , ' she said			2
however , veterinarian @entity63 has warned of the risks posed by breastfeeding puppies - in particular , the danger of zoonotic diseases ( conditions transferred between animals and humans )			1
' there are things that can be passed from puppies to babies , ' she said			0
' in an emergency situation , i do n't think it 's a big deal , but for them to grow appropriately , i think it would be important for them to get on a canine formula			0
' she added that human breast milk is not the most nutritional food for puppies - potentially damaging their growth and general health .			0
