great white sharks are one of the few species known to regularly poke their heads above the surface to survey the scene			1
and this huge female is no exception as she rises from the ocean just yards from a cage full of stunned divers			1
the image was captured by @entity13 photographer @entity12 , 40 , during a cage diving trip in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the great white shark investigates a cage filled with a potential human banquet feast the shark breached the surface several times as it ' sniffed the air ' in a bid to discover its next dinner he said : ' some were five metres long and a five metre great white shark is usually a very fat creature			1
' they appeared to be bigger than the small boat we were in			0
some would breach and stare right into our faces as they came up			0
' when these really big sharks turned up , the smaller ones would vanish			0
one shark in particular was very crafty			2
she drifted past the boat several times before swimming away from us			2
' it was if she made a show of letting us know she was going			2
then , within seconds of us losing sight of her moving away from the boat , she would suddenly burst out of the water right next to us from a completely different direction			0
' the stunning photographs were taken by @entity12 in @entity15 , @entity16 great white sharks , which often hunt seals , are known to poke their heads above the surface to spot prey			1
another theory is that they are smelling for whale carcasses above the water , as scent travels faster through air than through water			0
and in order to attract them to the boats , the tours will chum the sea by dropping mixtures of blood and rotten fish into the water			0
@entity12 , who took the photographs , said he once witnessed a great white shark get its teeth stuck in the bars of a diving cage , although he said he is unaware of sharks eating any tourists using similar protection but despite their huge size and power , cage diving with great whites is considered a safe activity			1
mr @entity12 , who hails from @entity85 but now lives in @entity16 , added : ' there have been no incidences of sharks eating tourists who go on a shark cage dives , although i did once witness a shark get its teeth stuck on the cage			1
' its thrashing nearly pulled the cage away from the boat			0
i was inside at the time and had a very good view of what it must feel like to be a seal in its last moments of life			0
' researchers use dead fish , known as chump , left , and a board shaped like a giant fish , right to attract sharks a pair of sharks circle the research boat off the coast of @entity16			2

mr @entity12 said when the shark jumped ' it stared us straight in the eye '
