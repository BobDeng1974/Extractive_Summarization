a teenager caught with a car boot of 20 cannabis joints should not be banned from becoming a teacher or a nurse , @entity0 suggested today			1
the @entity7 leader was challenged over his call for drug users not to be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances			1
he said it was ‘ ridiculous ’ that young people ’s future careers could be ‘ blighted ’ by nothing more than a ‘ teenage indiscretion ’			1
@entity0 was grilled about how many cannabis joints a teenager could be caught with without getting a criminal record the @entity7 manifesto will commit the party to ending imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use and ensure that those arrested with small amounts of illicit substances do not get a criminal record			1
but during his weekly radio phone - in , mr @entity0 was grilled about how many cannabis joints a teenager could be caught with without getting a criminal record			1
@entity36 host @entity35 said : ‘ i ’m an 18 - year - old student , i get stopped by police , i have 20 joints in the boot of my car			2
i subsequently want to become a teacher			2
can i become a teacher ? ’ mr @entity0 insisted that as the law stands that person would not be able to become a teacher			1
but he said the law needed to be changed : ‘ i think it ’s completely wrong if some teenager , 17 or 18 year old , dabbles in … i do n’t know whether it ’s 20 [ joints ] or one			2
‘ do i think their chances of working as a nurse , as a teacher , or a lawyer or a taxi driver should be blighted forever , of course i do n’t			2
‘ if you are a teenager , one in five youngster use drugs , a third of adults have used drugs at some point in their life in this country			1
‘ what you are saying to me is someone who as a 17 or 18 -- year - old and has smoked some hassish , and they are caught doing that , you ’re saying they should never ever … work as a nurse , as a teacher			2
’ @entity7 leader @entity7 shared a platform with @entity77 boss sir @entity76 to argue said drug users should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances yesterday 's announcement follows a controversial ‘ research ’ project ordered by @entity84 ministers , which used taxpayers ’ money to study drugs policy around the world			1
@entity90 and @entity91 jetted off to examine how other countries tackle drugs			1
they travelled to ten countries , including the @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , at a cost of almost £ 40,000			2
the @entity7 seized on parts of the report suggesting decriminalisation in countries like @entity97 cut the health damage caused by drugs			1
but critics said they ignored evidence that the number of children using drugs had risen			1
pressed again on the scenario of 20 joints , mr @entity0 hit back : ‘ if he has got 20 joints is he allowed to be a teacher			1
‘ your fixation is whether it was 20			2
my fixation is whether do i think they should be ruled out forever to work as a teacher			2
‘ i think it ’s ridiculous that we turn what might be a teenage indiscretion into a lifelong ban from public service in our schools and hospitals			2
‘ i think that is one of the many , many features of our approach to the so - called war on drugs which is irrational , and counter-productive			1
’ mr @entity0 yesterday shared a platform with @entity77 boss sir @entity76 who claimed that smoking powerful cannabis does not cause ‘ any harm ’			1
the @entity77 tycoon shared a platform with the @entity7 leader to promote the party ’s pledge			0
he said : ‘ of people taking hash [ cannabis ] , something like 99 per cent do not have a problem ... take people taking skunk			0
‘ it ’s slightly worse than alcohol			0
but there are a lot of people doing it for recreational purposes and they enjoy doing it and it ’s not doing them any harm			0
’ however , he today sought to clarify his remarks , insisting he was talking about ' hash ' and not ' skunk '			0
sir @entity76 said in a blog : ' what i did say was that many people take hash for recreational purposes and enjoy it without doing themselves any harm			0
' the same way that drinking alcohol , if you do it in moderation , is not going to do people any harm			0
' a study last month by @entity177 found that 24 per cent of new cases of psychosis are linked to the use of skunk			0
the report concluded that smoking skunk trebles the risk of someone having a psychotic episode			0
last night , mr @entity0 also insisted that the so - called ‘ war on drugs ’ was ‘ not working ’ , although he was later forced to concede that official figures show drug use has been falling in @entity189 for years			1
the home secretary @entity192 has blocked any softening of the drugs laws			1
the @entity7 want to take drug policy away from the @entity84 and place it in the @entity196 a poll of 100 charities by the @entity199 last night found that 69 per cent of charities in the field would be concerned if the government decriminalised cannabis			0
more than half ( 56 per cent ) said cannabis use would increase if its use was decriminalised			0
@entity206 , chief executive of charity @entity207 , which works with disadvantaged young - people , said : ‘ we are scared by the idea of liberalising cannabis laws			0
we work tirelessly to get the most disadvantaged and disengaged young people back into learning and to hold down jobs			0
if they are taking cannabis it makes it almost impossible to succeed – sapping their motivation and effectively tying our hands in the support we can give			0
‘ cannabis is ruining the life opportunities of those we work with , so the idea that society would be better off if this stuff was decriminalised is crazy			0
making it more easily available and more culturally acceptable will mean that more of our young people would take it			0
the result will be that more of our young people would fail to make the most of their potential			0

@entity0 said users should not be given criminal records for possession
he said decriminalisation would apply to ' harder ' drugs such as heroin
