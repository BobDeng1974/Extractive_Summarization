@entity0 has had his ' fare ' share of criticism in the past and it appears the @entity6 midfielder was in an unforgiving mood after enjoying a night out with his girlfriend @entity9			1
the couple shied away from the cameras after being spotted getting into a taxi after leaving the plush @entity13 in @entity14 on thursday			2
the childhood sweethearts , who have two children together , were believed to have left the popular footballers ' hotspot at around 11pm and looked less than impressed about being photographed after their evening out			0
@entity0 and girlfriend @entity9 enjoyed a night out at @entity14 's @entity21 on thursday night the couple did n't take too kindly to being photographed as they shied away from the camera and the early night was probably attributed to @entity0 's determination to return to the @entity6 starting line - up following a hamstring injury			1
the 29 - year - old has n't featured in the @entity29 for the @entity30 since tearing his hamstring in their @entity32 1 - 1 draw at @entity34			1
@entity0 has since made one substitute appearance for @entity37 's side , in their 3 - 0 @entity39 fourth round replay win at home to @entity41 on february 3 , but started for the @entity42 in their 2 - 1 win against @entity44 on monday night			1
prior to his injury , the @entity46 international was in impressive form for @entity6 - having made 13 appearances this campaign by the turn of the year			1
and @entity0 is keen to continue to improve under @entity52 - who has deployed the midfielder in an unfamiliar left wing - back role with relative success			2
@entity0 has started a @entity29 game for @entity6 since their 1 - 1 draw at @entity34 @entity0 ( right ) tore his hamstring during the @entity32 trip to the @entity59 @entity0 ( second right ) started @entity62 's 2 - 1 win at home to @entity44 on monday night the 29 - year - old midfielder says he is enjoying life under boss @entity37 at @entity66 this term ' i like the variation actually			1
i think there a lot of players who just like to stick to one position , but for me i do n't mind as long as i 'm in the team , ' said @entity0 , who made his 100th @entity76 appearance in last week 's win over @entity78 , in an exclusive interview with the club 's official match programme @entity80 earlier this week			2
' i 'm pleased with how the season has gone personally			0
of course you always have that thing in your head that makes you want to do better			0
' i 'm my own worst critic â€“ i want to play my best and i always try to do my best			0
even when i 've played well there is usually something that i think back to that i did n't do right			0
' i think this season has so far gone as well as it could have gone for me , bar the injuries			0
i 'm happy about that and hopefully we can continue with good results as a team			0
