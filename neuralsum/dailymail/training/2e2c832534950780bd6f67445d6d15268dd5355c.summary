by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 believes star player @entity4 should follow the example of @entity7 team - mate @entity6 in hardly missing a match for his country			1
the @entity11 - winning winger withdrew from the squad to face @entity13 in a friendly on wednesday with a leg muscle injury			2
it is not the first time the 24 - year - old has pulled out and former @entity3 manager @entity19 on sunday warned @entity2 having @entity4 available for friendlies will become more difficult			1
chilling : @entity7 and @entity3 star @entity4 tweeted this picture with the message : ' @entity23 ! just got to the hotel , thanks for the great welcome at the airport ! ' hard work : the @entity3 players train for their game with @entity13 at @entity31 on sunday meanwhile ... @entity4 is in @entity23 on a promotional tour for @entity34 fans but @entity2 is confident he is not experiencing a repeat of what happened to a number of his predecessors in relation to @entity41			1
' a lot was said about @entity41 when he missed a lot of friendlies for us but i do n't necessarily think that was his fault as there was a lot of pressure from @entity53 for him not to come and play , ' the @entity3 boss told @entity1			2
' he was the new @entity55 , a wonderkid , a sensation , and @entity53 wanted to look after him			0
' i think now the game has moved on a bit			0
@entity4 is one of the best players in the world and he is up there with @entity6 , playing in the same team			1
' look how many caps @entity6 has got for @entity64 - over 100 - he never misses			1
if it is good enough for @entity6 it is good enough for anyone			1
' to be fair in my time ' @entity68 ' has come even when he has been injured because he wants to be around the team and supporting the team			0
' we have never had an issue with him because he has already played friendlies for us , he has missed one or two but he has also played one or two			2
' @entity3 star : @entity4 should n't be missing many games for @entity3 , according to boss @entity2 follow his lead : @entity6 has over 100 caps for @entity64 , and barely misses a match @entity2 admits there is a balancing act to be done with @entity4 , who has won 47 caps , as what he does not want to do is alienate @entity7 in the longer - term by over-working one of their prized assets			1
' there are a lot of games for top - level players who are playing league , cup , @entity11 and international games , ' he added			2
' now and again they do need the rest but it is more the mental than the physical			0
' i hope it does n't come to the stage where we do n't get @entity4 for any friendlies			1
' it is not something i have envisaged really			0
i hope he is the same in the future as he has been in the past			0
' when he comes with us generally in friendlies he may play 45 minutes to an hour but we are mindful of sending him back in good condition - like all our players			0
' if you take advantage and send players back who ca n't play at the weekend the next time you go calling their managers are like ' well , you ca n't play them '			0
' i 've been there myself			0
we have a duty of care			0
' rare appearance : @entity4 trains with team - mates ahead of a @entity126 qualifier last year no 1 : @entity6 lead @entity64 to the @entity127 with a superb performance against @entity129 in the play - off @entity2 stressed he was not just singling out @entity4 as he expected all his players to be available for every game where possible but such is the @entity7 player 's profile the focus inevitably falls on him			1
' the gauntlet is thrown down to our lads to say " who is going to be the one to top 100 caps ? " , ' he added			1
' if you look at the @entity143 and @entity144 and even @entity146 - @entity145 , @entity147 , @entity148 are up there - with 100 - plus caps			1
' you do that by putting yourself up for all the games , not just the nice juicy ones worth three points			2
best of friend : the duo have built up a fine relationship at @entity7 this season watching eye : @entity2 is preparing for a tricky friendly against @entity13 on wednesday ' if you represent your country you represent your country and it is a huge honour to do that			1
' @entity64 have been playing tournament football and we want to do that but to play tournament football you sacrifice your summer and it is a small sacrifice			2
' you can have as many holidays when you retire as you like but your best days are your playing days , playing for your country is the best experience in my opinion			0
' @entity173 midfielder @entity172 will captain the side for the first time against @entity13 .			0

@entity2 tries not to *criticise* @entity4 in *interview*
but says he has missed ' one or two games ' , which @entity6 never does ...
@entity7 *colleague* has over 100 caps for @entity64
