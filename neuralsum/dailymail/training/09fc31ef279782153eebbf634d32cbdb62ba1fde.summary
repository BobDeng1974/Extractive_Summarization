@entity0 is making a wristband that detects cancer cells , and using human skin to do it			1
scientists in the life sciences division of @entity7 laboratories are working on a proactive , preventative approach to one of the world 's deadliest diseases , according to @entity12			1
the wristband would work in tandem with a pill that would send nanoparticles through the body to latch on to markers of different conditions and diseases including cancer , @entity22 , head of @entity23 , told the @entity24			2
' we have ( the nanoparticles ) circulate around your whole body looking for those cells and we collect them using a magnet and basically ask them what they saw , ' @entity22 said			0
the system relies on light emitted from the cells as a result of the nanoparticles , so scientists must understand how light passes through skin , according to the @entity12			1
so @entity0 started making skin			2
to assist with their research , the scientists have made molds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors			1
light : @entity22 , head of @entity23 ( here ) , explained the nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up , allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body while using skin in the research , scientists have to account for people of different ethnicity , resulting in different skin pigmentation , and thickness of skin , the @entity68 reports			1
as the wearable is still in the early stages of development , @entity7 is working to determine what defines a ' healthy ' person			0
they are monitoring 175 healthy volunteers to frequently collect physiological information			0
wristband / pill : the wristband would work in tandem with a pill that would send nanoparticles through the body to latch on to markers of cancer cells differences : while using skin in the research , scientists have to account for people of different ethnicity , resulting in different skin pigmentation , and thickness of skin @entity22 admitted that people may find it ' weird ' having particles constantly tracking the cells in their body			1
' it â€™s way weirder to have cancer cells floating through your body that are constantly trying to kill you , ' @entity22 continued			2
@entity22 told the @entity24 that the @entity7 team is trying to change medicine from being episodic and reactive to being proactive and preventive			0
' we 're making good progress but the journey is long and hard , he said			0
' so i think we will get there and i hope it 's years , not decades			0

scientists in the life sciences division of @entity7 laboratories are using human skin in their research to develop a wristband to detect cancer cells
the wristband would work in tandem with a pill that would cause *unhealthy* cells to light up
to understand how light passes through skin , @entity0 has made molds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors
