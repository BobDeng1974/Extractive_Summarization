@entity0 was shot dead by two gunmen and not just ' lone wolf ' @entity3 , a witness stood just metres away from the presidential candidate in a @entity6 hotel has claimed			1
@entity7 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , is convinced @entity3 - sentenced to life imprisonment after the killing - was the not the only man firing shots that fateful 1968 day			1
she told @entity14 : ' what has to come out is that there was another shooter to my right			0
the truth has got to be told			0
no more cover - ups			2
the former television actress , who was working as a volunteer fundraiser for @entity0 's campaign at the time , also said some of the ' 12 to 14 ' shots came from a different location to where the convicted murderer was standing			1
but the ' official reporting ' of the incident has left her frustrated after it was changed by the @entity31 , she claimed , to say that she only heard eight shots			1
she added : ' for me it 's hopeful and sad that it 's only coming out now instead of before - but at least now instead of never			2
' i never said eight shots			2
i never , never said it			0
there were more than eight shots			2
there were at least 12 , maybe 14			1
and i know there were because i heard the rhythm in my head			2
' when they say only eight shots , the anger within me is so great that i practically - i get very emotional because it is so untrue			1
tragic : @entity0 's casket arrives at @entity58 , @entity59 , for his funeral she said she ran out of the pantry , where the shooting took place , yelling : ' they 've killed him ! they 've killed him ! oh , my @entity67 , he 's dead ! they 've killed him !			1
' ' now , the reason i said , ' they ' is because i knew there was more than one shooter involved			0
although it was 44 years ago , i will swear that this is exactly what happened			0
convicted : @entity3 is trying to appeal his sentence ' i remember it like it was almost yesterday , because you do n't forget something like that when it totally changes your life forever			1
' it took a great toll on me			0
for a while , even the backfiring of a car would send me into tears			0
' @entity3 , now 68 , is currently serving a life sentence at @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92			2
he was the only person arrested , tried and convicted for the murder , and never contested the case , during his 1969 trial , that he was the only gunman			2
initially handed the death sentence , it was reduced to a life sentence in 1972			0
but he is now trying to engineer his release on the grounds that he was not the only gunman and that it was not him that killed @entity0			1
he is now awaiting a @entity105 @entity104 ruling which could see him released , re-tried or granted a hearing			0
the hearing would take place on the production of new evidence - including @entity7 ' eyewitness account			1
his lawyer @entity112 called the alleged @entity31 alteration of her story ' deplorable ' and ' criminal ' and said it ' mirrors the experience of other witnesses '			1
other witnesses have also mentioned hearing more than eight shots , but these have only been detailed in @entity123 summaries and not @entity31 reports			1
these included @entity125 , who thought she heard 10 shots , and @entity127 who said there was ' two quick shots , followed by a slight pause , and then another 10 to 12 additional shots '			1
brotherly love : the @entity0 siblings @entity134 ( left ) , @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity136 ( right ) a recently uncovered tape recording at the @entity29 's pantry by freelance journalist @entity139 also suggests there were 13 shots on june 5			1
analysis has revealed five of the shots could have been fired from another direction to where @entity3 's weapon was positioned			1
@entity0 's autopsy report also revealed his body and clothing were struck from behind , at right rear , by four bullets fired at upward angles and at point - blank range			1
but witnesses said @entity3 fired somewhat downward , almost horizontally , from several feet in front			1
@entity7 , whose witness account is now being reviewed by the federal judge , first met @entity0 two - and - a - half years before his death at @entity161 studios in @entity162 , @entity92			1
in the make - up room being prepared for her role in @entity165 , she said she was ' starstruck ' when he entered			0
he was there to pre-record an interview			0
dynasty : @entity136 ( centre ) poses with brothers @entity105 attorney general @entity0 ( left ) and president @entity134 at the @entity171 in @entity172 in 1962 she said : ' i saw @entity0 and everything else disappeared from view			2
there was an aura about him that was very captivating			0
he kind of pulled you in			0
' his eyes were very deep set and they were very blue			0
and when you looked at him , you got very drawn in to him			0
' she said it was at that point she decided to help @entity0 , who was then a senator for @entity59 , should he ever decide to run for the top job of president			2
@entity0 , the most seriously wounded of the six people shot , was gunned down just moments after claiming victory in @entity92 's @entity194 primary election			2
he died the next day , while the other victims survived			0
although @entity3 's lawyers are calling for his release , @entity7 , who was never called to testify at the trial , said he should remain in prison			1
she said : ' to me , he was absolutely there			0
i do n't feel he should be exonerated			0
there definitely was another shooter			0
the constant cover - ups , the constant lies - this has got to stop			0

@entity3 was not only gunman , claims eyewitness @entity7 - @entity7
' heard 12 to 14 shots , more than the eight he could have fired from his gun '
@entity31 altered her account , and never called her to testify during trial
