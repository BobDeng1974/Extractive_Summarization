a climbing system inspired by geckos has turned spiderman fiction into fact by making it possible for a human to scale vertical glass			0
during tests , an 11 - stone ( 70kg ) volunteer crawled up a 12ft ( 3.6 metre ) pane using just sticky attachments on his hands and feet			1
the demonstration was reminiscent of the way @entity13 scales skyscrapers in the @entity16 comics and films , as well as the way @entity19 clings to the @entity20 in @entity21 during @entity22 : @entity23			0
during tests , an 11 - stone ( 70kg ) volunteer crawled up a 12ft ( 3.6 metre ) pane using just sticky attachments on his hands and feet ( pictured ) but , unlike the sucker - gloves employed by mr @entity19 , or the science fiction of @entity16 comic books , the latest gecko devices are real and technologically sophisticated			1
they employ the same natural molecular forces that allow gecko lizards to scurry around on ceilings			2
geckos climb on a wide variety of surfaces , including smooth surfaces such as glass			0
they have adhesive pressures of 15 to 30 pounds ( 6.8kg to 13.6kg ) per square inch for each limb , meaning a gecko can hang its entire body by one toe			0
a gecko 's toe consists of a microscopic hierarchical structure of stalk - like setae - 100 microns in length , 2 microns in radius			1
from individual setae , a bundle of hundreds of terminal tips called spatulae - approximately 200 nanometers in diameter at their widest - branch out and contact the climbing surface			0
these hairs create an electrostatic force known as @entity67			2
it causes neighbouring molecules to be attracted to each other			2
although very weak , the effect is multiplied by thousands of tiny hairs that cover a gecko 's toes , allowing them to stick firmly to surfaces			1

adopting the same principle , scientists created tiny tiles called ' microwedges ' to generate @entity67 forces and produce a dry adhesive even more efficient than the gecko 's			1
during the experiment , the volunteer testing these microwedge attachments simply peeled them on and off the glass			0

these hairs create an electrostatic force called @entity67 that causes molecules to be attracted to each other the @entity132 team led by dr @entity133 , from @entity134 , wrote in the @entity135 : ' using this system , a human of mass 70 kilograms ( 11 stone ) successfully ascended a 3.6 - metre ( 11 ft ) vertical glass wall with 140 square centimetres of gecko - inspired dry adhesives in each hand			1
' we tested hundreds of individual steps on glass with the 70kg ( 11 stone ) climber and 140 square centimetres of adhesive without failure			1
' the synthetic adhesion system creates a nearly uniform load distribution across the whole adhesive area , improving upon the adhesive - bearing structures of a gecko 's toe and enabling a human to climb vertical glass using an area of adhesive no larger than the area of a human hand			1
' adopting the same principle , scientists created tiny tiles called ' microwedges ' to generate @entity67 forces and produce a dry adhesive even more efficient than the gecko 's			1
during the experiment , the volunteer testing these microwedge attachments simply peeled them on and off the glass ( design graphic pictured ) the demonstration was reminiscent of the way @entity13 scales skyscrapers in the @entity16 comics and films , ( illustrated left ) as well as the way @entity19 clings to the @entity20 in @entity21 during @entity22 : @entity23 ( pictured right ) the research was conducted in collaboration with the @entity132 @entity181 ( @entity181 ) , whose ' @entity183 ' programme is investigating biologically - inspired climbing aids for soldiers			2
one application of the technology might be to help astronauts get around in weightless conditions , the authors suggest			0
' recent work has shown that microwedges function in the environment of outer space , so it would be of interest to test this adhesion system in such an environment , ' they concluded .			0

@entity67 forces cause molecules to be attracted to each other
although weak , the effect is multiplied by hairs that cover a gecko 's toes
this *increases* the strength of the forces and allows them to stick to glass
scientists created ' microwedges ' tiles to generate @entity67 forces
these microwedges were *fitted* to the hands and feet of a researcher
the 11 - stone ( 70kg ) volunteer then climbed a 12ft ( 3.6 metre ) pane of glass
