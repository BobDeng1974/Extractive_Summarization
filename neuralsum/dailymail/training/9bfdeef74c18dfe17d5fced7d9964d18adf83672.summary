by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 after a solitary year at @entity3 ended with just eight appearances , it 's safe to say that not many fans would have been expecting @entity6 to star at a @entity7			1
but eight years after his fateful season on @entity11 , the @entity9 - born defender could be tasked with stopping his former team - mates with in @entity13			0
@entity14 take on @entity15 in their first group game in @entity17 , and will be wary of the presence of @entity19 and the guile of @entity21			0
but what about another man included in the 30 - man provisional squad , @entity6 ? surprise : @entity6 was included in @entity15 's 30 - man provisional @entity7 squad eight years ago : and @entity6 was signing on the dotted line at @entity3 , as a 20 - year - old hopeful aged just 20 , @entity6 made the brave decision to join @entity3 in a Â£ 2million move from hometown club @entity32			1
labelled as one for the future after starring in the @entity37 alongside @entity38 and @entity39 , the @entity34 signed a four - year contract			0
' @entity6 is very tough and he 's exactly the sort of player we need who will suit the @entity46 , ' @entity41 said back in the summer of 2006			2
' if you 're talking about @entity3 , he 's more like ' @entity48 ' ( @entity49 ) than @entity50			0
' unfortunately for @entity6 , he struggled to settle in @entity14 and played just three times in the @entity46 , though he did manage to score in a @entity53 game			0
a return to @entity55 followed with domestic giants @entity56 benefitting from some solid displays , but it was @entity6 's next move that has seen him thrust back into the @entity61 spotlight			2
@entity62 snapped up the 6 ' 3 " defender , and he flourished working in a back three			0
up and coming : @entity6 was in the same @entity55 youth side as @entity38 at the 2005 under 20 @entity7 ready for @entity14 : @entity6 poses with manager @entity41 and @entity66 upon signing on @entity11 rare high moment : @entity6 celebrates his solitary goal for @entity3 against @entity68 in the @entity53 due to his @entity70 ancesstors in @entity71 , @entity6 was deemed eligible for the national side - but only made his debut in march this year			1
despite the 28 - year - old 's international inexperience , @entity74 had seen enough to warrant @entity6 with a spot in his @entity7 squad , and an opportunity to help the four - time champions conquer once again			1
can he stop @entity81 , @entity82 ? will he make it ? @entity6 is hoping to make the 23 - man final squad so he can take on @entity14 in @entity17			1

@entity6 played just eight times for @entity3 in a season
played with @entity38 at @entity55 youth level , but eligible for @entity15
selected in @entity15 's 30 - man squad for the @entity7 this summer
