@entity0 has taken the unusual step of naming his @entity3 side to face @entity4 over 24 hours before the match kicks off , with three reserve forwards included in the starting @entity7 @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 have been tasked with leading the line for @entity0 's side , despite the fact that first place in the group is still up for grabs			1
the @entity17 have already ensured qualification to the knockout stages , but can still take top spot in @entity21 if they beat @entity4 and @entity22 lose to @entity23			0
@entity0 made the bold move of naming his xi the day before the game , despite it giving the opposition more time to analyse his players			0
the @entity3 squad to face @entity4 in @entity42 also features a return to action for @entity45 , who has been out injured since september 13th			1
@entity3 's team to face @entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity47 ; @entity45 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ; @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ; @entity10 , @entity54 , @entity9			1
subs : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62			0
@entity57 , who has made one fleeting @entity64 appearance , has been named on the bench both @entity33 ( left ) and @entity35 ( right ) have been left out of the squad to face @entity4 @entity3 guaranteed their place in the round of 16 with a win against group leaders @entity22 last time out			1
they will finish second in @entity21 unless they beat @entity4 and @entity22 lose to @entity23 ( or , more unlikely , the @entity72 side draw â€” and @entity3 win by seven )			0
with @entity75 next in the @entity64 , the @entity74 's return has added importance as he prepares to face his former club for the first time			0
@entity0 's bench , which he also named during monday 's press conference , features a number of youth players who are yet to make a first - team appearance			2
@entity57 , @entity58 , @entity84 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity59 all have a chance to feature on tuesday night , in a game that could yet prove decisive in @entity3 's season			2
@entity45 has not played for @entity3 since coming off against @entity88 in september @entity34 has not travelled to @entity42 and will be rested until @entity3 's game against @entity75 @entity58 ( right ) has made one sub cup appearance for @entity3 , but never in the league or @entity92			2
