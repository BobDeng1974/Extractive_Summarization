' @entity0 , pictured in action against @entity36 last season , was born in @entity13 and moved away aged seven umenyiora at @entity6 this summer during an @entity5 media day umenyiora winning the @entity20 with the @entity21 in @entity39 , @entity40 in february 2008 the @entity1 will be making their first trip to @entity13 for an @entity5 contest as they take on the @entity9 in the first ever lunchtime kick - off at @entity6			1
having been part of the first game at @entity6 seven years ago , @entity0 has witnessed the growth of @entity19 in @entity13 since the @entity5 began and thinks the league are well on their way to giving @entity8 a team of their own			1
' there are six teams coming over this year , ' he said			0
' next year there might be eight teams and the year after that 12 and then maybe they will think about a team here full time			0
' they 're doing the right thing			0
it 's a business and they have to expand and there 's no better place to do it than here where there is a fan base			2
' but @entity0 thinks the @entity19 will have to find a solution to the logistical difficulties that moving a team to @entity8 would create			1
he said : ' logistics here would be the hardest thing because , as far as having a fan base goes , they 'll have that here			2
' @entity73 is right next to the @entity17 and they have an @entity76 basketball team in @entity77			0
the @entity78 sometimes play there as well so it is easier travel wise			0
' the players will adjust to it			0
if i was getting paid , there 's not much i would n't do			0
they have a fan base here to support a team and the players who come here will get on with it			2
' what the @entity19 will have to do is have players that are from the @entity94			0
the people from @entity17 that live here would support the game first , but as soon as the people from @entity13 understand the game i think they will have a true feeling for it			2
' the @entity1 travel to @entity13 on the back of a fourth straight defeat having lost 29 - 7 in @entity106 the @entity1 landed at @entity107 on monday morning and will practice at @entity110 's @entity109 base this week ahead of their game against the @entity9 on sunday			1
with the game kicking off at 1.30pm @entity94 time , fans back in @entity113 will be watching the game at breakfast time			0
but @entity0 is confident the early start will not be an issue either for the players or followers back home			1
' they love football over there and they 'll wake up at 4am to watch football if they have to so i do n't think it will be a factor , ' he said			0
' i do n't know how it 's going to play out but we 're going to be here for a whole week before the game so we will have a chance to adjust and maybe practice early in the morning or do something that will acclimate us			0
