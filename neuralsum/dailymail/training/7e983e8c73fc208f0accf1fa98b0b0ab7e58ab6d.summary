but despite consulting advocacy groups , many spoke out against @entity1 's reinstatement - the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) issuing a statement yesterday to @entity11 saying it the network is just greedy to capitalize off the hit show			1
' @entity1 should look @entity47 and gay people in the eyes and hear about the hurtful impact of praising @entity51 laws and comparing gay people to terrorists			2
if dialogue with @entity1 is not part of next steps then @entity54 has chosen profits over @entity47 and gay people – especially its employees and viewers , ' the said			2
the fourth season is set to premiere this january , and was largely completed before @entity1 made the statements , meaning he did n't miss a single episode of filming during the ban			1

conservative supporters include @entity76 , who wrote in a @entity78 post : ' free speech is an endangered species			0
those intolerants ’ hatin ’ and taking on the @entity2 patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us			2
' @entity3 initially took action after @entity1 's comments caused uproar , saying his views were ' disappointing ' and that @entity3 has always been ' strong supporters and champions of the lgbt community			1
' now , the network says the family has made it clear that they are sorry if they caused any offense with the patriarch 's remarks			2
' while @entity1 ’s comments made in the interview reflect his personal views based on his own beliefs , and his own personal journey , he and his family have publicly stated they regret the “ coarse language ” he used and the mis - interpretation of his core beliefs based only on the article			1
he also made it clear he would “ never incite or encourage hate			0
” we at @entity110 expressed our disappointment with his statements in the article , and reiterate that they are not views we hold , ' reads the statement			0
reinstated : @entity1 wo n't miss a day of filming after his brief hiatus was reversed by @entity3 the homophobic comments from the born - again @entity119 included such insights as , ' ' it seems like , to me , a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man ’s anus			1
' that ’s just me			0
i ’m just thinking : there ’s more there ! she ’s got more to offer			0
i mean , come on , dudes ! you know what i ’m saying ? but hey , sin : it ’s not logical , my man			0
it ’s just not logical			0
' he also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists , saying , ' we never , ever judge someone on who ’s going to heaven , hell			0
that ’s the @entity145 ’s job			0
we just love ' em , give ' em the good news about @entity147 - whether they ’re homosexuals , drunks , terrorists			0
we let @entity151 sort ' em out later , you see what i ’m saying ? ' @entity42 hit back soon after the interview was released online , calling him a ‘ stain ’ on the network @entity3 which airs the show			1
@entity42 spokesperson @entity161 told @entity162 news : ' @entity1 and his family claim to be @entity119 , but @entity1 's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true @entity119 believe			1
' he clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of @entity172 - and @entity173 - who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples			0
disgusted : reverent @entity178 said @entity1 's comments make him worse than the bus driver who infamously sent @entity181 to the back of the bus ' @entity1 's decision to push vile and extreme stereotypes is a stain on @entity3 and his sponsors who now need to reexamine their ties to someone with such public disdain for @entity193 people and families			1
' in addition to his anti-gay rhetoric , the duck hunter also made dubious remarks regarding @entity199 before the @entity200			0

i 'm with the blacks , because we 're white trash			0
we 're going across the field , ' said @entity1			2

' for many , including reverend @entity178 , who compared @entity1 to the driver who sent @entity181 to the back of the bus the attempts at damage control by a $ @entity233 were insufficient			2
' these statements uttered by @entity1 are more offensive than the bus driver in @entity236 , @entity237 , more than 59 years ago , ’ @entity178 said in a statement obtained by @entity239			2
‘ at least the bus driver , who ordered @entity181 to surrender her seat to a white person , was following state law			0
' @entity1 ’s statements were uttered freely and openly without cover of the law , within a context of what he seemed to believe was “ white privilege			2
