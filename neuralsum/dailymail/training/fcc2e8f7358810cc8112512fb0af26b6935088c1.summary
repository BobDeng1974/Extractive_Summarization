a controversial scene on sunday night in which a housemaid was subjected to a brutal assault by a valet sparked nearly 100 complaints from disgusted viewers			1
domestic violence campaigners said the show ’s creator @entity17 had depicted rape in an obscene and irresponsible manner			1
any victims of a real - life sexual assault who happened to be watching could have been traumatised , they said			1
even the @entity2 , the owner of @entity24 where @entity4 is filmed , joined the criticism , saying she preferred ‘ to look at nice things on a sunday night ’			0
a message before the episode – the third in the current series – warned it contained ‘ violent scenes that some viewers may find upsetting ’			1
but many of 8.8million viewers who watched were unprepared for what followed			0
@entity35 from the charity @entity36 said @entity9 should have made it clear the episode contained sexual violence so rape victims could switch off			1
she said : ‘ they had a warning about violence before the programme but it was n’t an explicit warning about sexual violence			1
' the scene was clearly an implied rape , and that can trigger terrible memories in rape survivors			2
content like that can be very traumatic			0
’ author and anti-rape campaigner @entity56 claimed the show ’s author @entity17 had added the attack simply to enliven a ‘ dull ’ storyline			2
‘ you ca n’t just insert a scene like this into a cosy drama			2
you have to treat rape sensitively , rather than use it as a plot device , ’ she said			0
the @entity68 's later edition yesterday : @entity4 fans said they had been left disgusted by the violent rape scene ‘ instead of focusing on the impact of the violence on mrs @entity75 , it repeated basic rape myths , such as the idea rapists are always creepy guys			1
in fact , they are normal people and are often related to the victim			0
‘ if you are going to portray rape on tv , you have to do it responsibly			0
it was gratuitous , obscene and irresponsible			2
it made me want to switch off			0
’ in the controversial scene , which @entity4 ’s makers insisted yesterday had been ‘ acted and directed with great sensitivity ’ , servant @entity75 , played by @entity88 , was beaten and raped			1
the horrific assault took place downstairs as opera singer dame @entity94 – played by soprano @entity95 – entertained @entity4 ’s aristocratic residents upstairs			1
@entity97 , a house guest ’s valet , played by former @entity101 actor @entity100 , pushed the maid – who is married to @entity104 ’s valet – against the wall and attempted to kiss her			1
when his advances were spurned , he flew into a rage and raped her			2
@entity108 : @entity75 played by @entity88 is raped by mr @entity97 , played by newcomer @entity100 in shock : the @entity111 audience was warned about the violent scenes ahead of the show , but @entity4 fans have complained they were still not prepared for what happened distressing : viewers have criticised the rape scene in episode three of @entity4 although the episode was shown after the 9pm watershed , many viewers felt the scene was inappropriate for a family drama			1
@entity124 tweeted that she felt ‘ sick ’ , adding : ‘ rape & violence against women are not entertainment tactics			2
’ @entity129 added : ‘ i am v uncomfortable with plot turn by @entity131 – rape as entertainment			0
’ another said : ‘ i realise that @entity4 is essentially just a big soap opera , but i absolutely hate when rape is used as a plot device			0
’ offensive : many watching said that the decision to feature violence against women as a key plotline was ' morally reprehensible ' complaint : one viewer said they were so shocked by the scene that they planned to make an official complaint to the broadcast regulator @entity149 @entity2 said her research had uncovered no incidents of sexual abuse among the domestic staff			1
‘ i did n’t watch [ sunday ’s episode ] but i gather it was less pleasant , ’ she said			2
‘ i imagine that @entity17 [ @entity17 ] is exploring with different storylines and darker themes			0
‘ he will also have watched the reaction to see where he will take the stories in the future , i ’d imagine			0
’ @entity149 said it had received 30 complaints yesterday and was assessing whether to hold a full investigation			0
