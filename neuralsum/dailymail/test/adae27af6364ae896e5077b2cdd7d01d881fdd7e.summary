it is an astronomical nightmare - if an asteroid were spotted headed towards @entity4 , what could humanity do about it ? the @entity7 's latest mission hopes to find out if crashing into it will help			1
experts hope the impact will be large enough to alter its orbit			0
the mission will take place in two parts , and this month marked the start of preliminary design work on @entity7 's @entity29 , or @entity30			1
intended to demonstrate technologies for future deep - space missions , @entity30 will also be the @entity7 's very first investigation of planetary defence techniques			1
launched in october 2020 , @entity30 will travel to a binary asteroid system – the paired @entity37 asteroids , which will come a comparatively close 11 million km to @entity4 in 2022			1
the 800 m - diameter main body is orbited by a 170 m moon , informally called ' @entity40 '			0
this smaller body is @entity30 's focus : the spacecraft will perform high - resolution visual , thermal and radar mapping of the moon to build detailed maps of its surface and interior structure			1
@entity30 will also put down a lander – @entity7 's first touchdown on a small body since @entity54 's @entity53 landed on a comet last november			1
two or more cubesats will also be dispatched from the mothership to gather other scientific data in the vicinity of the moon			0
@entity30 's findings will be returned by high - capacity laser link to @entity7 's @entity63 on @entity64 in the @entity65			1
' @entity30 should gather a rich scientific bounty – gaining valuable insights into the formation of our @entity69 – but these activities will also set the stage for a historic event to come ,			0
a similar collision was achieved back in 2005 , when @entity10 's @entity76 shot a copper impactor into asteroid @entity78			1
but the @entity80 is several tens of times smaller than @entity78 , so much greater precision will be required to strike it – and the possibility of altering its orbit should be correspondingly higher			0
the @entity87 moon is nearly three times larger than the body thought to have caused the 1908 tunguska impact in @entity91 , the largest impact in recorded history			2
an equivalent asteroid striking @entity4 would be well into the ' city - killer ' class , leaving a crater of at least 2.5 km across and causing serious regional and climate damage			2
the 2013 @entity99 airburst , whose shockwave struck six cities across @entity103 , is thought to have been caused by an asteroid just 20 m in diameter			2
@entity30 is also @entity107 's contribution to the larger @entity109 mission : @entity109			2
in late 2022 , the @entity10 - led part of @entity109 will arrive : the @entity112 , or @entity113 , probe will approach the binary system – then crash straight into the asteroid moon at about 6 km / s. ' @entity30 will be watching closely as @entity113 hits @entity116 , ' explains @entity117 , managing the mission for @entity7			1
' in the aftermath , it will perform detailed before - and - after comparisons on the structure of the body itself , as well as its orbit , to characterise @entity113 's kinetic impact and its consequences			0
the target for the international @entity109 mission , of which @entity7 's @entity29 ( @entity30 ) is a part			2
in 2020 @entity30 will head to the paired @entity37 asteroids , which will come a comparatively close 11 million km to @entity4 in 2022 launched in october 2020 , @entity30 will travel to a binary asteroid system – the paired @entity37 asteroids , which will come a comparatively close 11 million km to @entity4 in 2022			1
the 800 m - diameter main body is orbited by a 170 m moon , informally called ' @entity40 '			0
' the results will allow laboratory impact models to be calibrated on a large - scale basis , to fully understand how an asteroid would react to this kind of energy			0
' this will shed light on the role the ejecta plume will play – a fundamental part in the energy transfer and under scientific debate for over two decades			0
' in addition , @entity113 's shifting of @entity116 's orbit will mark the first time humanity has altered the dynamics of the @entity69 in a measurable way			0
' it will also give us a baseline for planning any future planetary defence strategies			0
' we will gain insight into the kind of force needed to shift the orbit of any incoming asteroid , and better understand how the technique could be applied if a real threat were to occur			0
' @entity30 and @entity109 will be discussed at this month 's @entity163 , hosted at @entity7 's @entity4 observation centre in @entity165 , @entity166 , which will be devoted to assessing the risk of impacts from asteroid and comets and envisaging possible responses			1
this year 's event features a simulated asteroid threat exercise , to which representatives of global space agencies and disaster response organisations will coordinate their reactions			2

@entity7 craft will launch in october 2020 to a binary asteroid system
paired @entity87 asteroids , will come a comparatively close *11m* km
will take high resolution pictures of surface and *analyse* it
craft will watch as @entity10 sends a probe crashing into the asteroid 's surface
