she said : ' it does n’t add up and it just seems a bit silly			0
i would not enter miss @entity26 because i do n’t live there			2
' how can she go to miss @entity28 when she ’s got a miss @entity4 title but is from @entity10 ? ' the locals know the contestants and they ’re going to be like " hold on , who is she ? has she done anything for our community ? " ' but miss @entity1 today defended herself saying there was not a beauty pageant in her home county of @entity10 , as it is technically an historic county and is now mostly part of @entity41 with sections in @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
she said : ' at the time , i was n’t aware that anybody had a problem with me being from another county			0
' everyone at the event in @entity4 was really welcoming and made me feel very comfortable - especially when i was crowned the winner			2
' there was no beauty pageant contest in @entity10 and because @entity4 is nearby and i have friends living there , i decided to enter			1
under competition rules anyone from within 50 miles of the @entity4 border can compete			1
miss @entity11 ( left ) , named ' @entity59 ' is calling for the rule to be scrapped and the tiara to be taken away from @entity14 ' it ’s a shame that someone has reacted this way , but it ’s not going to stop me , it ’s all for @entity28			1
' i do n’t see what the problem is , it is quicker for me to get to @entity68 than some of the other girls driving from parts of @entity4			2
' i ’m not sure the reaction is down to jealously but i can see where they are coming from			0
' miss @entity11 is from @entity74 , near @entity75 , which is almost exactly the same distance from @entity68 as @entity9 , home to @entity14			1
@entity78 , from @entity68 , who organises the beauty pageant each year , defended the decision to award @entity81 the @entity14 @entity4 title			2
the 43 - year - old said : ' i have only had one complaint about @entity81 winning this year ’s beauty pageant			0
' none of the other girls have taken an exception to the geography of where @entity81 lives , apart from @entity11			0
' but what else was @entity81 supposed to do ? not enter at all ? it is not her fault her home county was not hosting a @entity14 @entity28 heat			0
miss @entity1 has defended the win , saying there was no @entity10 competition , so she joined one nearby ' if she did n’t apply for miss @entity4 she would have been denied the opportunity to chase her dream - which would n’t have been fair			1

' miss @entity4 is a stepping stone for talented young women to use to pursue their dream of winning miss @entity28 and potentially @entity123			1
' @entity81 lives in @entity9 , it would take her less time to get to @entity68 , where the final was held , than people who live in parts of the county			2

' @entity81 will now take part in the @entity28 competition in @entity135 , @entity136 , in june .			0
