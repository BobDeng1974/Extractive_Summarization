@entity0 believes @entity2 's busy schedule should exclude him from @entity3 under 21 duty , but suggested @entity5 could do with the game time			1
the former @entity8 manager highlighted that , despite still being eligible , @entity2 's participation in the @entity10 , @entity11 and senior national side meant he was unlikely to benefit from playing for the @entity13			1
' whilst as a coach you always want the best possible players available , sometimes i do n't think it is the right or appropriate challenge for the individual player , ' the @entity15 boss said			2
@entity2 has become a regular with both @entity3 and @entity24 , for whom he also plays in @entity26 @entity5 is in the @entity3 under 21 squad , though , as he bids to regain his form and fitness ' @entity2 is one who i do n't say is finished at this level but , clearly , having played in the @entity31 , he 's now made himself pretty much a first - choice for the senior team			1
' what would we get back in terms of his feelings and his mood ? he is a great professional , i have to say , so i am sure he would react to it in the right way because he did when he came back with us last year			0
' but are you going to get exactly the same performance ? he has got @entity3 seniors , he has got @entity24 with the league , he has got @entity24 with the @entity11			1
' on the list of priorities , the 21s would n't necessarily be so high			0
for the group , you think you 're bringing back the best players but it would n't necessarily guarantee you get a better performance whereas the boys with us this week , for them this is everything			0
@entity0 said he wants the best players for his under 21 side but has to consider all factors @entity58 said he did not doubt @entity2 's attitude but felt it would not benefit him to join the @entity15 ' so we win both ways , really			1
we give @entity2 the experience of continuing with the seniors and we also get the experience for the group that remains with us			2
' while @entity2 was included in the senior squad for the @entity71 qualifiers against @entity72 and @entity73 , defenders @entity67 and @entity5 dropped into the @entity15			1
the former was bumped back up after an injury to @entity76 , although @entity78 left - back @entity5 remains with the @entity15			1
it was not a decision @entity0 took lightly but , like @entity2 , believes the decision is for the betterment of the individual and country			1
' @entity85 did really well last month , so would @entity5 start for the seniors this time around ? what 's the best experience for him ? ' he said			1
@entity89 is a strong advocate of the international under 21 level of football , and explained that to @entity5 @entity67 was initially in the under 21 squad , but was promoted after the injury to @entity76 ' i think certainly from his club perspective playing two matches would be good because he has not had a lot of football			1
' i know @entity89 was very positive to him about it			0
also , having been manager of a national team and spoken so much about the importance of the @entity15 in preparation for the @entity103 last summer , i did n't think we were going to have an issue from the club			2
' @entity0 admitted that he had considered whether @entity5 's meteoric rise would affect his motivation , but has faith the former @entity111 man is in the right frame of mind			2
he said : ' you 're thinking , " where 's the player with it , " because his world has changed a lot since we had him last november			0
' he has played as many matches this campaign as our other left - backs , but his world has changed considerably			0
@entity0 said @entity124 had spoken to @entity5 about playing for the @entity15 21 side @entity126 was @entity0 's predecessor as under 21 manager , but was sacked last summer ' but he has been brilliant			1
@entity124 spoke to him , which i think was important , i then spoke to him before we met up and a really good chat since we got here			0
' he is looking forward to the game			0
yes , he played at the @entity31 , he has played friendlies for the seniors , but he has only got three caps for us			0
' so although he is making brilliant progress in his career , he is not the finished article so experiences like this can only help him			0
' having won their @entity143 qualifying group at a canter , the unbeaten @entity13 now face a two - legged clash with @entity146 as they look to progress to next summer 's finals in the @entity148			1
they prepare for that tournament in the shadow of a miserable performance at last years 's edition in @entity153 , where the @entity15 returned home embarrassed after losing all three games			2
it led to manager @entity126 losing his job , with the former under 21s boss this week saying successor @entity0 should get the pick of the talent to avoid similar failure this time around			2
