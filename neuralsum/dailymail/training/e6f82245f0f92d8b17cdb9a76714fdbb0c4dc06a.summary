one of its rare side effects is a continued painful erection , which occurs in one out of every 10,000 to 20,000 users			1
priapism usually affects men but in rare cases , can affect women too			0
the condition is where a penis or clitoris becomes engorged with blood , causing a painful , long - lasting erection			1
it is caused by a blockage of the blood vessels that empty the penis			0
also , a number of medications can sometimes disrupt the normal workings of the nerves that help trigger an erection by widening the arteries in the penis			2
the nerves essentially ‘ forget ’ to narrow the arteries after the feelings of sexual arousal have passed , leading to priapism			0
those that have been linked to priapism include anti-depressants , erectile dysfunction medication and some recreational drugs			0

@entity103 , the medical name for a continued erection , is known to cause fibrosis			2
this is when hard , fibrous tissue forms in the penis - in a process similar to scarring			2
scar tissue forms on the lining of the erectile tissue , where blood is held in the penis when a man has an erection			2
the area becomes hard and the scar tissue prevents normal stretching , affecting the size and shape of the erect penis			0
if the muscle and the arteries of the penis become hardened with fibrous tissue , it can lead to erectile dysfunction			0
