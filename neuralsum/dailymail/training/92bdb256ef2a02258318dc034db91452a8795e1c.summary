scientists investigating the brain of one of the world 's most famous autistic people have found several features that can explain her unique talents			1
@entity8 , professor of animal sciences at @entity10 , is what is known as a ' savant ' - someone who shows some of the social deficits of autism yet also has some exceptional abilities			1
a tireless campaigner for autism research and awareness she is known for her exceptional non-verbal intelligence , spatial reasoning , sharp visual acuity and an uncanny gift for spelling and reading			1
@entity26 : professor @entity8 , left			1
unlike controls ( top right ) , professor @entity8 has lateral ventricles ( bottom right ) that are significantly larger on the left side of her brain than on the right the subject of an award - winning eponymous - titled biographical film starring @entity40 , professor @entity8 was also in 2010 listed in the time 100 list of the 100 most influential people in the world in the ' heroes ' category			1
in a bid to understand her cognitive gifts , and the accompanying weaknesses , a group of neuroscientists gave the professor a series of psychological tests and scanned her brain using several imaging processes			2
@entity56 , a graduate student at the @entity57 who presented the work at the @entity60 's annual meeting , explained their aims to the @entity62			2
' we asked how might brain structure and function be related to both outstanding ability and outstanding disability — the autism — within the same brain , ' he said			0
the professor received exceptionally high scores on several psychological assessments , including tests of reading , spelling and spatial reasoning			0
she achieved a phenomenal perfect score on @entity80 's @entity79 test , which assesses non-verbal reasoning			1
her weakest skill was found to be verbal working memory			0
scans showed professor @entity8 's brain is significantly larger than that of three matched neurotypical control subjects - something seen in some children with autism but which scientists do not yet understand			1
her lateral ventricles - chambers which hold cerebrospinal fluid - are different in size , with the left much much larger than the right , a finding mr @entity56 described as ' quite striking '			0
on both sides , the professor possesses unusually large amygdala , sectors of the brain which are part of the limbic system and have been shown to perform a primary role in the processing of memory and emotional reactions			0
the researchers also traced white - matter connections in professor @entity8 's brain using diffusion tensor imaging , finding what they dubbed ' enhanced ' connections in the left precuneus , a region involved with episodic memory , visuospatial processing , reflections upon self , and aspects of consciousness			1
autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with , and relates to , other people			2
it also affects how they make sense of the world around them			0
it is a spectrum condition , which means that , while all people with autism share certain difficulties , their condition will affect them in different ways			2
some people with autism are able to live relatively independent lives but others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need a lifetime of specialist support			2
people with autism may also experience over- or under - sensitivity to sounds , touch , tastes , smells , light or colours			1
asperger syndrome is a form of autism			0
people with asperger syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence			0
they have fewer problems with speech but may still have difficulties with understanding and processing language			0
( source : @entity163 ) they found she also has enhanced white matter in the left inferior fronto - occipital fasciculus			0
this region connects the frontal and occipital lobes , which might explain the professor 's keen visual acuity , the researchers said			2
in keeping with the double - edged nature of professor @entity8 's condition , she also has some weak connections , which the researchers said were defined in part by decreased integrity of brain - tissue fibres			1
one weak area was her left inferior frontal gyrus , which includes the famous @entity186 's area , which has functions linked to speech production and impairment of which can leave brain injury sufferers mute			2
professor @entity8 's right fusiform gyrus - a brain region involved in facial and body recognition - also had compromised connections			1
the findings agreed with the professor 's own personal assessments of her abilities			1
she has previously written how words are , for her , only understood when translated into pictures and described how she finds socialising ' boring '			0
she has noted in her autobiographical works that autism affects every aspect of her life			0
she has to wear comfortable clothes to counteract her sensory integration dysfunction and has structured her lifestyle to avoid sensory overload .			0
