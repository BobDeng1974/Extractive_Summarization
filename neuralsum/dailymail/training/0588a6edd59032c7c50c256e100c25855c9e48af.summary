@entity2 's tax system is a ‘ complicated ’ mess which successive governments have made even worse , the @entity0 said last night			1
@entity5 , director of the economic forecaster , launched a withering attack on a tax system which he said is riddled by complexity and shows ‘ few signs of a wider coherent strategy			1
’ he criticised council tax for becoming ‘ increasingly absurd ’ , claimed stamp duty was ‘ a strong contender for the @entity2 ’s worst - designed tax ’ and condemned the increase in the number of higher rate taxpayers to around five million people			1
the number of higher rate taxpayers and those paying tax at 45 per cent has soared from 3.3million when the coalition government came to power to an expected 5.3million next april , while rules on the chocolate eyes of gingerbread men remain complex every government is guilty of tweaking , tinkering and tearing up tax rules , which are then overhauled by their successors			0
what is left is a complex web of rules , and hundreds of bizarre unintended consequences			0
they include : mr @entity5 also ridiculed ministers for boasting about helping ‘ hard - working families ’ by increasing the tax - free personal allowance - but failing to change @entity36			1
in a speech in @entity39 last night at an event organised by the @entity41 he said @entity2 ’s tax system is far more complex than it needs to be			1
he cited the example of @entity45 being charged at 20 per cent on gingerbread men decorated with chocolate - but not charged if only two bits of chocolate are used for the gingerbread man ’s eyes			2
mr @entity5 said stamp duty is ‘ one of the worst designed and most damaging of all taxes ’ , and is one which ‘ helps to gum up the entire property market			1
’ he said the tax , paid by the majority of homebuyers when purchasing a property , will be worth around £ 15billion a year by 2018			0
that compares to just £ 800million in 1997			0
it used to be charged at one per cent on homes sold for more than £ 60,000 , but is now charged at five different thresholds of up to seven per cent on homes bought for more than £ 2million			0
the @entity0 singled out the absurdity of the threshold system , which means a £ 1 increase in the sale price of a property can increase the tax bill by £ 40,000			0
mr @entity5 added : ‘ the case for maintaining stamp duty is very weak indeed			1
’ moving on to council tax he said it is ‘ patently inequitable ’ because the tax is based on the valuation of people ’s homes which was done in april 1991			1
mr @entity5 warned : ‘ it seems more than likely that we will enter the 2020s and beyond with our main property tax ... based on property values from the latter part of the last century			1
’ the @entity0 director accused politicians of being too scared of revaluating people ’s homes because ‘ the political cost of creating losers is judged too great			1
’ the number of higher rate taxpayers and those paying tax at 45 per cent has soared from 3.3million when the coalition government came to power to an expected 5.3million next april			0
that ’s because the starting salary at which higher rate tax is paid has fallen from £ 43,875 to £ 41,865 today and only £ 42,285 next april			0
mr @entity5 said this ‘ reflected a deliberate policy choice by a government aiming to keep down the ( huge ) cost of raising the personal allowance			2
’ mr @entity5 also ridiculed ministers for boasting about helping ' hard - working families ' by increasing the tax - free personal allowance - but failing to change @entity36 and he said the increase in the number of higher rate taxpayers represents a ‘ fundamental change to our tax system ’ , but one which has ‘ never been announced or properly debated			1
meanwhile an increase in the amount you can earn before paying tax has seen more people paying national insurance when they are not paying income tax			0
since 2010 the personal allowance has increased from £ 6,475 a year to £ 10,000 a year but the starting point at which @entity36 is charged has barely changed			0
mr @entity5 said : ‘ it is hard to think of a rationale , and none has been offered			2
’ more than one million low - paid workers are now paying @entity36 , but not income tax , he said			2
@entity5 , director of the economic forecaster , launched a withering attack on a tax system which he said is riddled by complexity and shows ' few signs of a wider coherent strategy ' he said it is now ‘ a commonplace accepted by virtually all tax experts outside of @entity136 and @entity137 that @entity36 is no more than an additional tax on earnings ’ , adding : ‘ they are a tax			1
’ mr @entity5 said : ‘ the pious statements of politicians that they are raising the personal allowance in order to help ‘ hard - working families ’ look less credible in the face of the clear fact that raising the @entity36 primary threshold would be more effective in doing so			1
’ meanwhile , he also singled out the failure of the government to apply annual inflation - linked increases to some key tax changes , such as the scrapping of child benefit			2
since january 2013 , no family is allowed to receive child benefit if one or both parents earn more than £ 60,000			0
they start to lose child benefit once one of their salary ’s goes over £ 50,000			0
equally , the tax - free personal allowance begins to be withdrawn once a person ’s salary hits £ 100,000			2
he said : ‘ chancellors looking to fill their coffers as a result of fiscal drag will no doubt enjoy the effects of the lack of indexation of these new thresholds , but this looks like a move away from rational design			0
’ mr @entity5 also said the married couples ’ tax allowance has been poorly designed because it creates such a ‘ cliff edge ’ - that is , the problem of becoming a higher rate taxpayer			1
a couple will lose the benefit , worth around £ 210 a year off their tax bill , if one of them becomes a higher rate taxpayer			0
for example , a £ 1 pay rise could result in an additional £ 210 tax bill			0
last night , @entity194 , tax policy director of the @entity41 , said it is ‘ very important that the @entity2 has a coherent and workable tax system ’ , but warned : ‘ much work remains to be done			1
’ he said politicians have ‘ a duty to respond ’ to mr @entity5 ’s criticisms , even though they are a ‘ often driven by short - term pressures ’			1
a @entity137 spokesman said : ‘ as part of our long - term economic plan , we have steadily cut income tax so that hard - working families have more financial security for the future			2
‘ our tax reforms have made the @entity2 one of the most competitive countries in the world , attracting investment , jobs and business			2
‘ we have changed the approach to tax policy making so that it is more predictable , stable and simple			0

@entity5 said it shows ‘ few signs of a wider coherent strategy ’
director of the economic said council tax is ‘ increasingly absurd ’
he said stamp duty was ‘ strong contender for @entity2 ’s worst - designed tax ’
