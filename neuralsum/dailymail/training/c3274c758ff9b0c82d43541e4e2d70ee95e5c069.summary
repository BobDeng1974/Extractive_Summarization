by @entity0 @entity1 pulled no punches last night as he admitted his sloppy @entity3 only had themselves to blame for this dispiriting home defeat			1
just seven days after rolling over the @entity9 here in a dramatic penalty shoot - out , the @entity8 side ’s @entity6 hopes was shattered by their @entity13 visitors in a disappointingly one - sided encounter			1
the @entity16 winners now need a glory night of similar proportions to that victory over @entity20 if they are to turn the tables in the return leg			1
class above : @entity24 converts after @entity25 spilled his first effort to grab his second goal @entity28 : @entity25 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity1 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 ( @entity34 29 ) , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 76 ) , @entity39			1

subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64			2
booked : @entity49 , @entity56			2
goals : @entity24 34 , 64			1
att : 7,001 skipper @entity30 gave them an outside chance courtesy of his injury - time strike , but @entity24 was the two - goal hero for @entity46			1
his 34 - minute opener was stunning but his second just after the hour mark was a gift after @entity32 was punished for a wayward back pass			2
a less - than - impressed @entity1 insisted the tie was n’t over but said : ‘ we ’ve got to do a lot better to give ourselves a chance			2
‘ we ca n’t play for 15 minutes at the start of the second half and five to 10 minutes at the end and expect to beat teams who are technically very good			2
‘ we played into their hands because we did n’t perform in the first half			2
that was the most disappointing thing			2
‘ i ca n’t really blame @entity32 because he attempts to play a pass at their second goal and it goes in a different direction			0
‘ we just gave away too much possession in bad areas and the decision making was poor			0
i was n’t happy at half time because we did n’t even compete			0
that ’s not like us			0
we did n’t win second balls and it was all too easy for them			0
‘ we were better at the start of the second half and @entity29 has a great chance to make it 1 - 1			0
then straight after that they get their second goal			0
’ @entity1 insisted @entity3 must show their real qualities next week to avoid spinning out of @entity104			1
‘ we ’ve still got a chance the tie is alive but we ’ve got to play better			0
we ’re not often out - worked our out - competed but that ’s what happened and with the quality they have , they hurt us			0
the real @entity28 have to turn up in the return leg			1
’ without striker @entity113 , sidelined with a thigh injury , @entity3 struggled from the offset and , in truth , the damage could have been a lot worse had slick @entity46 taken all of their chances			1
it was hoped the return of @entity1 to the dug - out following the death of his mother would inspire the hosts			0
but the visitors began more brightly and @entity3 had keeper @entity125 to thank for keeping them at bay			0
with 12 minutes gone , skipper @entity52 ’s pass released @entity24 , and his driven shot was well saved by @entity25 at his near post			1
from the corner , @entity24 rose tallest to meet @entity56 ’s dead - ball but his header was by tipped over this time			1
top dog : @entity24 celebrates scoring his second goal which should see his side through midway through the first - half , playmaker @entity56 went on another driving run which ended in his ambitious effort from 25 yards taking a deflection and going behind			1
saints suffered an unexpected blow when @entity33 limped off to be replaced by substitute @entity34			0
things went from bad to worse when @entity46 went ahead in some style just after half an hour			0
@entity56 , who had been orchestrating play since kick - off , slid a perfect pass through to @entity24			1
he galloped free of a static @entity3 defence , before rifling an unstoppable left - foot finish from inside the penalty area beyond the reach of @entity152			0
it was no more than @entity46 deserved for their enterprising efforts throughout the first - half			0
saints surely could n’t be so poor after the break and , within minutes of the restart , they forced the visiting keeper into a save			0
@entity36 latched on to @entity161 ’s through ball , only to see his effort held comfortably by @entity47			0
consolation : @entity30 is congratulated on his stoppage time goal which gave the @entity3 hope that gave the largely subdued home crowd a much - needed lift and their favourites ought to have equalised in 56 minutes			1
full - back @entity173 sent over a tempting cross deep into the @entity13 penalty area which was met by the on - rushing @entity29			1
he failed to hold his nerve , however , and headed wide from 10 yards			0
saints ’ brief resurgence came to an abrupt end in 63 minutes when @entity46 went two in front			0
@entity32 ’s attempted pass - back was woefully short and @entity24 seized upon a golden opportunity , rounding @entity25 to roll the ball home			1
soon after , @entity46 threatened to pile more misery on @entity1 ’s men when @entity56 set up @entity53 , but he fired wide with just @entity25 to beat			0
the @entity8 side refused to give up and @entity30 ’s fine finish low into the corner from @entity36 ’s cross gives them some hope			1
@entity46 boss @entity195 felt his players more than deserved their victory but refused to accept his team were home and dry ‘ we scored two goals on the night and i believe there was a third goal just hanging there , ’ he said			1
‘ but @entity28 are a very good team and they will fight to the last minute so the tie is not over			1
’ hard to take : the @entity3 will have to raise themselves again to have any chance in the second leg			2

@entity28 continued their dreadful recent home form
chances of @entity213 qualification now look bleak after home defeat
@entity8 side have been good on @entity104 travels which will give them hope
@entity13 striker @entity24 made the difference for his side with two goals
@entity30 scored to give @entity28 some hope for second leg
