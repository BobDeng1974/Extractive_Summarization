perhaps people are so blinded by their irritation with his garish lifestyle outside the ring that they can not see his genius when he knuckles down in sport ’s hardest work - place			1
so eager are so many of the public – and some of the pundits – to see him lose that they can not bear to watch how brilliantly he wins			0
which , by the way , he has now done in all 47 of his professional fist - fights			1
@entity0 ( @entity14 ) is the centre of attention after his victory over @entity18 @entity0 reacts to @entity18 's bite on saturday night and ( right ) goads the dazed @entity20 there is something ludicrous about a grown man who is so obsessed with earning hundreds of millions dollars that he nicknames himself money disposing of so much of that hard - earned cash on over-priced bling			1
but that should not affect judgement of his phenomenal boxing talent			0
by no means everyone at the @entity34 ringside on saturday night gave @entity0 credit for the brilliant way he snuffed out the wild , raging , often illegal and , yes , outrageously biting assault on his record and his world titles by @entity18			2
it was a masterful performance of bewildering elusive movement – which defied his 37 years – and explosive power , which frequently left his younger challenger not only pawing at thin air but gasping for the breath to survive			0
lots of money but no fun , complained some , presumably choosing to ignore how the humorous way he personally redirected the befuddled and frustrated @entity18 when he kept wandering towards the wrong corner at the end of the round			0
@entity0 expresses indifference to such lack of admiration but there can be little doubt that it irks a man who is so preoccupied by his legacy that his cap bears the log @entity14 … the @entity63			2
yet he continues to prevaricate about meeting the one opponent he needs to defeat if he is even to be considered as great as the two @entity65 – @entity66 and @entity67			0
@entity68 was the other name on everyone ’s lips as future opponents for @entity0 were discussed			1
it has been for years now and unless they trade blows before one of them retires the public will be entitled to feel deprived			0
even so @entity0 , having said initially ‘ let ’s make it happen , ’ immediately back - tracked into his tired and inappropriate demand that the @entity68 ’s promoter @entity82 would have to be excluded from the $ 300million event			1
@entity0 must fight @entity68 ( left , with next opponent @entity84 ) to secure his legacy that has given rise to optimism that our own @entity89 will finally get his chance , next year , to prove that his speed can wreak the downfall of @entity0 , who he assesses as ‘ looking older and slower			1
’ that expectation is fuelled further by mr @entity96 , grand master that he is , pondering a different end game			1
having declared his intention to retire after two fights next year , he has shifted the ring posts again by hinting that he may not box again until september 2015			2
the excuse is that his body may need a year to fully recover from his physical effort against @entity18 but the intention could well be to extend his career into 2016			2
by then the @entity110 and casino , the home for his mega-fights , will have constructed a new , state - of - the art indoor stadium significantly large than the 16,000 - plus capacity @entity115 they use at the moment			0
@entity89 ( left ) may get another chance to fight @entity0 , whom he watched vs @entity18 with @entity119 @entity0 volunteered to take part in the ground - breaking for that project on the eve of his first fight with @entity18 this may			1
so who better to inaugurate that glittering venue ? what more glitzy way for @entity0 to climax his career ? and who else to invite to participate in that spectacle other than @entity68 , in the fight which would define them both			1
the man they love to hate appears to be planning to give everyone what they want			0
boxing says a prayer for @entity139 @entity140 boxer @entity139 is reported to be in ‘ critical ’ condition following a brain operation after he was knocked out in his home town on friday night			0
the 29 - year - old welterweight ’s plight comes as a grim reminder of the risks which all fighters take , be it on a @entity0 mega-millions production in @entity34 or for a modest purse in a local hall			2
across that entire spectrum , the boxing fraternity will be praying for one of their number in distress .			0

@entity0 has won all his 47 professional fights
the @entity162 man irritates pundits and fans with lifestyle outside the ring
@entity0 has to fight @entity68 to be considered the best
@entity0 may extend his career to 2016 and bow out vs @entity68
@entity89 could also get a chance to *dethrone* mr @entity96
