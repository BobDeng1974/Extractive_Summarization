by @entity0 published : 03:50 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 03:50 est , 28 november 2012 we 're becoming a nation of sluggards walking 80 fewer miles a year than just a decade ago , experts have revealed			1
the lack of exercise is leaving @entity7 at risk of dying early from chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer			0
today the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) has published new guidance to try and tackle this ' silent epidemic			0
' gridlock : cars are choking up our towns as more people than even drive even for short trips the controversial advice includes urging town halls to ' restrain ' car use with restrictions and higher fees , thus forcing people to walk			1
however , a professor of exercise at @entity28 said action did need to be taken as being inactive was the fourth leading cause of premature deaths around the world , and the problem was getting worse			0
' in the past decade we have lost about 80 miles per person per year in terms of walking for transport , ' she told the @entity37			2
in the late 1990s we each walked around 250 miles , however by 2008 that had dropped to 170miles			1
at the same time the number of journeys we went by foot rather than by car plunged from 44 per cent in 1975 to 22 per cent today			0
strategic and scientific adviser to the @entity45 dr @entity44 , said new guidance was thus essential to try and reverse the trend			0
he said : ' only a minority of people in @entity50 get enough physical activity to improve their health			1
' this creates a huge and often invisible burden of illness and reduced quality of life , but most people seem unaware of that burden			2
' across the population , lack of physical activity causes roughly the same level of ill health that smoking does			1
on the hoof : walking to the shops can save or parking costs and is better for your health , say experts ' we all face barriers in changing our lifestyles and many of us feel we do n't have the time or the inclination to add regular physical activity into our lives - it can be very difficult to break old habits and change behaviour			1
' but walking and cycling to work , to school , to the shops or elsewhere can make a huge difference			0
' this guidance aims to help people in local authorities , public health professionals , schools , workplaces , the @entity94 and many others to make the changes that are needed to support this safe , healthy and mostly enjoyable physical activity			1
' other suggestions to encourage activity include creating special signs showing distances and walking times			1
however , some of the guidelines such as raising parking charges have met with strong opposition			2
chief executive of the @entity109 's @entity108 said the ' meddling health bureaucrats ' were out of touch with struggling families			2
he said : ' things are tough enough for taxpayers already without meddling health bureaucrats trying to make parking more expensive			2
' for more people using the car is a necessity , not a luxury			0
' parking charges damage the high street , place an unnecessary burden on struggling businesses and make life harder for households just trying to make ends meet			0
' @entity12 's boneheaded attempts to interfere demonstrates how out of touch they are with the pressures faced by hard - pressed families			0
