since the @entity1 unleashed the first nuclear bombs on @entity3 and @entity4 back in 1945 there have been a staggering 2056 nuclear tests recorded worldwide			1
it took almost a year until the next substantial tests took place but by the mid- 50s and 60s , nuclear experiments were being recorded across the globe on almost a monthly basis			1
to demonstrate the scale and development of this technology , @entity13 artist @entity12 has plotted all these explosions that took place from 1945 up to 1998 in a time - lapse video map			1
as the map begins , it zooms into the @entity1 and a small flashing blue dot is shown on the screen just days before another			2
these signify the dropping of the @entity28 atomic bomb dropped on @entity3 on 6 august 1945 and the @entity30 bomb on @entity4 just three days later			0
as more tests are carried out , the map zooms out to show the whole globe			2
every time a country has detonated a nuclear weapon in the past 50 years , a flashing dot appears in above it on the map			2
the @entity39 was set up midway through the @entity40 and began work on developing the @entity1 ' nuclear technology			0
in may 1945 @entity43 signed a surrender agreement with the @entity45 to signal the end of the war in @entity48 , however , the war in the @entity50 carried on and the @entity45 were contemplating invading @entity13			1
they asked @entity13 to surrender but the @entity13 government ignored the @entity53 on july 26 , 1945			1
by august 1945 , the @entity39 had developed and tested atomic bombs at its @entity56 base and on 6 august , a @entity58 atomic bomb , left , was dropped on @entity3 on august 6 , 1945 , followed by a @entity30 bomb , right , on @entity4 three days later			1
the blasts are said to have killed a total of 245,000 deaths by november 1945 and the effects from radiation are still reported to this day			0
on 15 august , @entity13 surrendered and signed the @entity65 on september 2 , officially ending @entity40 a tally of total bombs dropped is shown in the bottom right - hand corner of the video , as well as a tally that shows how many bombs each individual country has used during that time			1
flashes increase further during the early 1960s and by 1998 , the @entity1 tested 1032 while the @entity74 had 45 among others			0
@entity12 started the project in 2003 and told @entity77 he created it with the goal of showing ' the fear and folly of nuclear weapons			1
' he was born in 1959 and studied in @entity83 at the department of @entity85			0
he then got a job as a curator at the @entity89 museum in @entity90 , @entity13			0
because the map runs up to 1998 , it does n't include the tests reported by @entity94 in october 2006 , may 2009 , and february this year			2
every time a country has detonated a nuclear weapon in the past 50 years , a flashing dot appears			0
a tally of total bombs dropped is shown in the bottom right - hand corner of the video , pictured , along with a tally that shows how many bombs each individual country has used			0

the map has been created by @entity13 artist @entity12
it begins with the @entity111 **'s** ' @entity110 ' test in 1945 in @entity56
the video ends with @entity115 **'s** nuclear tests that took place in may 1998
