by @entity0 its 970 acres offer you breathtaking island views , unspoilt sandy beaches and the chance to watch otters , golden eagles and red deer			1
if you fancy the self - sufficient lifestyle , @entity9 off the north - west coast of @entity11 also boasts an endless supply of lobster , scallops and grouse			1
the private island has just gone on sale for £ 500,000 – less than you ’d pay for a family home with a tiny patch of garden in @entity22 and many parts of the @entity24			1
the island of @entity9 : it has been uninhabited since the @entity27 famous visitor : hercules with owner @entity30 before you decide to leave the chaos , expense and pollution of city life behind , however , a word of caution : although it looks idyllic in this picture , @entity11 ’s north - west coast is the windiest part of @entity41 , and it suffers more than its fair share of rain – up to 250 days a year			1
@entity9 ( pronounced ‘ wee - a ’ ) used to be home to a crofting family with ten children , but has been uninhabited since the @entity27			1
half a mile south - east of @entity49 , it has to be accessed by private boat from nearby @entity51			2
the island is currently owned by @entity53 , a mother of five from @entity54 , who bought it for about £ 20,000 in 1980 after she and her late husband , @entity57 , spotted a small advert in a newspaper			2
she said : ‘ it just seemed such an opportunity to have our own island			2
it was a bit of a romantic whim			0
’ as far as she can recall , they did not even visit the island before buying it			0
the hideout used by @entity70 following the @entity71 in 1745 was put up for sale earlier this month the 970 - acre island also has sporting rights , and in recent years the land has been used for woodcock and duck shooting			1
there is also red deer stalking and fishing mrs @entity53 , 57 , compared owning the island to having ‘ your own wildlife reserve ’ , adding that deer often swim over from nearby islands			0
@entity9 , which has views to neighbouring @entity88 , has two claims to fame			1
the fugitive @entity70 is said to have hidden in a cave there for a few days after the disastrous @entity71 in 1746			1
the cave , known as prince @entity94 , is on the east side of the island , which is mostly covered in heather with a number of small freshwater lochs			0
more recently , the island was briefly home to @entity102 , the tame grizzly bear which ran away while being filmed for a tv advertisement for @entity106 tissues			2
in august 1980 @entity102 , who was an impressive 8ft 4in , escaped while swimming , triggering a three - week hunt which became a worldwide media sensation			0
the island has been uninhabited for over a century , although the current owners - the @entity53 family from @entity115 , who bought it in 2003 - used it for holidays and summer camping @entity70 eventually sought shelter in this cave on @entity9 , now known as ' prince @entity121 ' , while his followers kept watch for the @entity41 navy the prince eventually obtained passage to @entity126 and escaped , pledging to his remaining followers that he would return with an army after a long and fruitless search , the first clue was found on @entity9 when his collar and his pawprints were spotted there			1
he was eventually rescued on @entity134 and reunited with owner @entity30			0
yesterday @entity135 , an associate at @entity136 , the estate agency selling the island , said it has already attracted one viewer keen to return for a second look			0
but there are some significant hurdles for anybody keen to get away from it all and live the ‘ @entity146 ’ dream			0
there is no house on the island , except the ruins of an old stone cottage , although it does have planning permission to be turned into a small three - bedroom home			1
the planning rules dictate that it can be used only as a holiday home , although it is not clear who will enforce this rule if the new owner decides to move permanently to the island			1
it currently has neither running water nor electricity , although mr @entity135 said both problems could be fixed by a wind turbine , solar panels or a generator , and water pipes from the fresh water lochs			0
he said : ‘ you could live on the island very happily and be self - sufficient			0
’ it is likely to have its own salmon and sea trout fishing rights , although these are currently being negotiated			0
for her part , mrs @entity53 admits that she and her children rarely visit the island , which is why she has decided to put it on the market , although she feels in two minds about the decision			2
‘ i do n’t really mind if it does not sell , ’ she said .			0

@entity9 , off the coast of @entity88 , has been put up for sale for £ 500,000
