@entity0 started only sixth after his error in yesterday 's qualifying session - inexplicably aborting his final run believing he could n't improve on his time - but he had already gained two places on the opening lap before the race was suspended for an hour following a huge crash involving @entity59			1
@entity59 was taken to the on - track medical centre after he lost control of his @entity62 on the exit of @entity64			1
the @entity65 ran off the circuit but as he attempted to re-join the track on the @entity68 he caught a bump sending his @entity62 sideways and into the barrier			0
@entity59 then slid helplessly across the track with the @entity22 of @entity72 , in his 200th grand prix start , crashing into the side of his @entity62 despite the @entity76 's last - gasp efforts to avoid him			2

the @entity195 did n't pit until six laps later , but he suffered a problem with his rear - left tyre and was stationary for 1.4seconds more than his team - mate			0
it appeared to have blown @entity0 's chances of tasting victory in front of his home crowd for the first time in six years			1

' @entity247 , who started in 16th , was the man on the move in the early phase of the race launching an audacious pass on the @entity180 of @entity41 before making a move on @entity109 and then @entity253 's @entity151			0
that left the @entity62 man in 5th after just 16 laps , but his progress was thwarted after he was handed a five - second stop - and - go penalty for being out of position at the start			0
he was then involved in a brilliant battle with @entity150 for fifth with the pair both prepared to push the boundaries to gain the upper hand			0
@entity150 ultimately prevailed following a sumptuous pass on @entity247 at @entity266 in the closing stages to finish fifth			0
