it seems a roaring fire was n't the only thing keeping @entity3 and @entity4 warm through cold winter nights			0
from northwest @entity8 , from 1500 to 1300 @entity9 , to the @entity11 island of @entity12 as late as the first century @entity13 , @entity7 people were drinking an alcoholic ‘ grog ’			1
pictured here is an ancient @entity33 drinking - set , comprised of a bucket a ladle , and several drinking cups			0
they were uncovered under the floor of a settlement at @entity40 in @entity11 honey bog cranberry @entity43 bog myrtle @entity45 @entity46 @entity48 tree resin wheat grapes @entity51 rye by analysing chemicals found in ancient jars , scientists revealed that the drink was a hybrid of local ingredients			1
these included honey , bog cranberry , lingonberry , bog myrtle , yarrow , juniper , birch tree resin , and cereals including wheat , grapes barley and rye			1
the research proves the existence of an early , widespread , and long - lived @entity7 grog tradition - one with distinctive flavours and probable medicinal purposes			1
it also provides the first chemically proven evidence of importing grapes from southern or central @entity78 as early as 1100 @entity9 , demonstrating both the social and cultural prestige attached to wine			1
samples of the drink were found buried in tombs alongside warriors and priestesses			1
pictured here is a uoung woman , believed to be a priestess , buried in an oak trunk coffin under a mound at @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity8 with dr @entity97 's help , @entity95 - based @entity94 recreated the @entity7 grog in october 2013 , using wheat , berries , honey and herbs			1
according to dr @entity97 , the grog tastes sour , like a @entity105 lambic			2
there are also other options available to those who want a taste of @entity110			0
the @entity11 brewery @entity112 , for instance , created different version of grog called @entity115			0
‘ about the closest thing to the grog today is produced on the island of @entity12 in the @entity119 , ’ dr @entity97 noted			0
‘ you can taste @entity121 in farmhouses			0
it ’s made from barley , honey , juniper , and other herbs like those in the ancient version			1
' ‘ far from being the barbarians so vividly described by ancient @entity29 and @entity33 , the early @entity4 , northern inhabitants of so - called @entity133 , emerge with this new evidence as a people with an innovative flair for using available natural products ’ , said dr @entity97 , lead author of the paper			1
‘ they were not averse to adopting the accoutrements of southern or central @entity78 , drinking their preferred beverages out of imported and often ostentatiously grand vessels , # he added			0
‘ they were also not averse to importing and drinking the southern beverage of preference , grape wine , though sometimes mixed with local ingredients			1
” to reach their conclusions the researchers , based at the @entity148 , obtained ancient residue samples from four sites in a 150 - mile radius of southern @entity11 and encompassing @entity8			0
the oldest , dated 1500 – 1300 @entity9 , was from @entity153 in northwestern @entity8 , where a warrior prince had been buried in an oak coffin with a massively hafted bronze sword , battle - axe , and pottery jar whose interior was covered with a dark residue that was sampled			0
a second @entity8 sample , dated to a later phase of the @entity163 from about 1100 – 500 @entity9 , came from a pit hoard at @entity165 , southwest of @entity166			0
a brownish residue filling a perforation of a bronze strainer , the earliest strainer yet recovered in the region , was sampled			0

the bucket was part of a standard , imported @entity33 wine - set , and the woman held the strainer - cup in her right hand			2
a reddish - brown residue filling the holes and interior of a strainer - cup , again part of imported @entity33 wine - set , provided the fourth sample			2
dating to the first century @entity13 , the strainer - cup was excavated from a hoard , which also included a large gold torque or neck ring and a pair of bronze bells , at @entity40 on the @entity11 island of @entity12 in the @entity119			0
according to dr @entity97 , the importation of southern wine grew rapidly in the @entity3 and @entity209 , and eventually eclipsed the grog tradition - but never completely			2
many of the ingredients in @entity7 grog went on to be consumed in birch beer and as the principal bittering agents of medieval beers , before hops gained popularity			1
to reach their conclusions the researchers obtained ancient residue samples from four sites in a 150 - mile radius of southern @entity11 and encompassing @entity8			0
pictured here is a map of southern @entity7 , showing archaeological sites investigated ‘ about the closest thing to the grog today is produced on the island of @entity12 in the @entity119 , ’ dr @entity97 noted			1
‘ you can taste @entity121 in farmhouses			0
it ’s made from barley , honey , juniper , and other herbs like those in the ancient version			1
’ with dr @entity97 's help , @entity95 - based @entity94 recreated the @entity7 grog in october 2013 , using wheat , berries , honey and herbs			1
' the base of @entity244 is a toasty red winter wheat , and the bog - grown berries deliver a pungent tartness , ' according to the website			2
' while a handful of hops is used , the earthy , bitter counterpunch to the sweet honey and birch syrup comes from the herbs			2

@entity7 grog *predates* @entity256 and was found buried in tombs of warriors
other grog ingredients included honey , lingonberry , juniper and cereals
there was also evidence of grape wine imported from @entity29 and @entity30
@entity94 in @entity95 has recreated the drink using wheat , berries , honey and herbs
