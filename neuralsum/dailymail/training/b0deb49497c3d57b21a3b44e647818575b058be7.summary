scientists have carried out a post-mortem examination on a dead star that exploded in a nearby dwarf galaxy in an effort to better understand supernovas			1
they believe they have spotted a pulsar wind nebula appearing from the ashes of the dead stars , and also claim to have solved a mystery surrounding the unusual shape of its remains			1
the supernova , known as @entity15 , was first seen by observers in the southern hemisphere in 1987 at the edge of the @entity19 , 168,000 light - years from @entity20			1
pictured is an outline of the and inner debris of the supernova 's remains , as seen with the @entity32 ( green / blue contours ) , on top of @entity36 observations of the remnant at 345 @entity38 ( red / orange ) more than 25 years after spotting the explosion , an @entity41 - led team has used radio telescopes in @entity41 and @entity44 to see inside the remains of a supernova			1
by combining observations from the two telescopes we 've been able to distinguish radiation being emitted by the supernova 's expanding shock wave , ' said lead researcher dr @entity53 from the @entity54			2
' this is important because it means we 're able to separate out the different types of emission we 're seeing and look for signs of a new object which may have formed when the star 's core collapsed			1
' it 's like doing a forensic investigation into the death of a star			2
' the observations with the @entity70 and @entity71 radio telescopes revealed signs of something never seen before , located at the centre of the dead star			0
' it could be a pulsar wind nebula , driven by the spinning neutron star , or pulsar , which astronomers have been searching for since 1987 , ' said dr @entity53			1
' it 's amazing that only now , with large telescopes like @entity71 and the upgraded @entity70 , we can peek through the bulk of debris ejected when the star exploded and see what 's hiding underneath			2
' more research published recently also attempts to shine a light on another long - standing mystery surrounding the supernova remnant			1
since 1992 the radio emission from one side of the remnant has appeared ' brighter ' than the other			0
in an effort to solve this puzzle , dr @entity97 , another researcher from @entity54 , has developed a detailed 3d simulation of the expanding supernova shockwave			0
a mosaic of images showing the latest observations of supernova remnant @entity15			1
the map on the bottom right of the mosaic is obtained by combining five images			0
this is used to investigate whether there is a pulsar wind nebula inside the remnant pictured are images showing different views of the supernova remnant			1

the middle panel shows @entity117 as seen by the @entity70 while the right image is a visualisation of the remnant showing the location of a pulsar a supernova sends titanic shock waves rumbling through interstellar space			2
it leaves behind an ultra-dense neutron star in its wake , which spews out a blizzard of high - energy particles			1
@entity15 was a supernova in the outskirts of the @entity135 in the @entity19 , a nearby dwarf galaxy			1
it occurred approximately 51.4 kiloparsecs from @entity20 , or around 168,000 light - years - close enough that it was visible to the naked eye			0
the light from the supernova reached @entity20 on february 23 , 1987 , with its brightness peaking in may of that year			2
in the two and a half decades since then the remnant of supernova @entity143 has continued to be a focus for researchers the world over , providing a wealth of information about one of the universe â€™s most extreme events			2
' by introducing asymmetry into the explosion and adjusting the gas properties of the surrounding environment , we were able to reproduce a number of observed features from the real supernova such as the persistent one - sidedness in the radio images ' , dr @entity97 said			0
the time - evolving model shows that the eastern side of the expanding shock front expands more quickly than the other side , and generates more radio emission than its weaker counterpart			0
this effect becomes even more apparent as the shock collides into the equatorial ring , as observed in @entity32 images of the supernova			0
' our simulation predicts that over time the faster shock will move beyond the ring first			0
when this happens , the lop - sidedness of radio asymmetry is expected to be reduced and may even swap sides , ' dr @entity97 said			0
' the fact that the model matches the observations so well means that we now have a good handle on the physics of the expanding remnant			0
' we are beginning to understand the composition of the environment surrounding the supernova - which is a big piece of the puzzle solved in terms of how the remnant of @entity15 formed			1
' @entity15 was a supernova in the outskirts of the @entity135 in the @entity19 , a nearby dwarf galaxy			2

supernova , known as @entity15 , was first seen by astronomers in 1987
scientists believe they have found a new object *emerging* from its ashes
they say it could be a pulsar wind nebula , driven by the neutron star
researchers also claim to have solved a mystery surrounding the *unexpected* shape of the star 's remains
