i want to see great jobs in these industries here in @entity4			0
' that is why we have sought and received robust assurances from @entity8 were a deal to go ahead			0

' that is exactly what i will do			0
i will not make the mistakes of some previous governments			0
' outright hostility , abject surrender - that 's what you have seen in the past			0

he said ministers should have ‘ reserve powers ’ to protect @entity4 companies when crucial interests are at stake			0
‘ foreign takeovers can often be hugely helpful and i have no doctrinal preoccupations - i 've done enough takeovers of small businesses myself to know how valuable they can be , ’ @entity178 told the @entity134			1
‘ but the important point is that every other advanced economy has mechanisms of some sort on a failsafe basis to scrutinise foreign takeovers and we 're the only country that does n't			0
; i think that is a mistake and i think there are so many issues about the science base , about supply chains , about employment prospects that ought to be explored			0
‘ i do n't see any way in which this can be adequately done unless the government has reserve powers			0
‘ it 's a question of where their headquarters are , where the decisions are taken , who determines what research is done and where , how much government money goes into supporting the science base within a co-operative arrangement , where the supply chains are going to be and what the motive is			0
