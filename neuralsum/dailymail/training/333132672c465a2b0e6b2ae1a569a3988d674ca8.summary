@entity0 has admitted to winding up his mate @entity1 as his wife @entity3 takes part in @entity5			1
the former @entity7 striker saw his wife , @entity9 , crowned @entity5 champion last year but had to endure false rumours that she had developed feelings for her dance partner @entity14			2
indeed , the popular @entity16 series has a reputation for being a curse on relationships and that fact has n't escaped @entity21 striker @entity0			1
however , despite teasing his pal , the footballer has also spoken out to praise @entity3 's performances on the show			2
' i 've been watching the show and @entity3 's doing really well , ' he added			2
' i have n't had a chance to watch it with @entity9 yet because i 'm always at football			0
' it 's good , but there 's obviously something missing this year ! @entity0 was plagued by false cheating rumours when his wife @entity42 was on the show last year , however the couple are still together @entity3 and her professional dance partner @entity46 are favourites to win the series this year so far , unlike so many celebrity couples before them , @entity3 and @entity1 have not yet fallen victim to any claims that she has developed feelings for her dance partner @entity46			1
however , the fact that he ’s engaged to fellow @entity5 dancer @entity56 , who is partnered with @entity57 , no doubt helps on that front			0
but @entity3 has also spoken out about the dreaded @entity5 curse to insist that her husband does n't have anything to fear when it comes to her loyalty			0
' we have male dancers with @entity69 , so he knows it ’s just dancing , ' she explained			0
' @entity1 has nothing to worry about			0
' @entity42 was crowned the @entity5 champion last year after surviving the @entity5 curse , perhaps @entity9 and @entity0 have a few tips they could share with @entity1 and @entity3 on how to make it through @entity1 and @entity3 have n't yet had any false accusations thrown their way			1
