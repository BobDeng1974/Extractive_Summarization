by @entity0 published : 19:25 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 08:21 est , 4 november 2013 red lips , professionally tousled locks , a sparkly dress ... when it comes to the red carpet , @entity4 certainly knows all the ingredients to looking like a star			1
but when @entity4 went shopping in @entity9 recently she looked more like , well , one of us			2
dressed casually in tight black leggings , black and white @entity14 trainers and an oversized patchwork cape , the 25 - year - old was barely recognisable as she browsed furniture shops at the @entity17			1
rushed off her feet : @entity4 with her baby son @entity19 on a recent shopping trip to the @entity17 her hair was piled on her head in a messy top knot , with loose strands blowing in the wind			1
she did n’t appear to be wearing any make - up and her only item of jewellery was a thin gold chain that she wears around her neck			0
in her arms she clutched her one - year - old son , @entity19 , whose face was covered by a hooded sweater			1
and she stared at the ground as she tried to go unnoticed			0
the @entity36 singer was looking at furniture at the upmarket @entity17 , where the @entity39 has also been known to shop , houses showrooms for some of the leading interiors brands			0
hold me close : @entity4 held baby @entity19 close as she leaves the shopping area located in @entity17 , it is round the corner from the @entity47 , where @entity4 can often be found lunching with her partner @entity48			1
on tuesday , however , it was just her and @entity19			2
a @entity17 employee said : ‘ i barely recognised her to begin with , we get so many celebrities come through here and they all dress down and look really normal so they do n’t get bothered			0
' she came in looking for furniture and went into a couple of different showrooms but she did n’t stay long , i do n’t think she bought anything			0
' new mum style : @entity4 dispenses with the glamour as she enjoys spending time with her son , and right , seen all glammed up to pick up her @entity62 for @entity64 award for @entity65 earlier this year @entity4 has remained incredibly private and secretive about her son - who she has affectionately dubbed ‘ little peanut ’			1
in january this year rumours the singer had named her child @entity19 were triggered when the singer spotted wearing the name on a gold necklace			2
a spokesperson for the star was unavailable for comment and has still been unable to confirm the name .			0
