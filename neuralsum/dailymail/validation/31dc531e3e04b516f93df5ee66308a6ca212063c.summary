@entity1 assistant coach @entity0 has called on the @entity3 organisers to adopt a @entity5 - style format of synchronised kick - off times on the final day of competition			1
under current broadcasting agreements , the last round of fixtures is staggered throughout the day in a bid to maximise television audiences ; with @entity1 facing @entity13 in tomorrow 's early tie			1
with the three - way race likely to be decided by points difference , the approach gives fellow challengers @entity19 and @entity20 – who are up second and third – a clearer indication of their required score - line and , according to @entity0 , lessens the entertainment value			1
@entity1 assistant coach @entity0 ( left ) wants the final round of @entity3 games to be sychronised ' i do really enjoy the last day of the @entity5 , where everyone listens to their radios to hear the scores , ' said @entity0			1
' the drama of that situation is unique and it would be unique in rugby - probably that should be the case in the @entity3			1
' ultimately , in terms of all of us kicking off at the same time , there would be some drama in the game ; knowing what changes need to be made and the message we need to get onto the pitch			2
going up first , it 's important we win the game			2
@entity19 and @entity20 will have the opportunity after our game to know what they have to do , which is always a good thing			0
' wales need a landslide victory to overturn the points advantage of their two title rivals			0
they must capitalise on every attacking opportunity and , following an injury to @entity60 , the chances of a significant winning margin have been given a major boost			1
@entity62 revealed on wednesday that the @entity64 skipper had just a ' 30 - 40 per cent ' chance of being fit for the tie at the @entity67 , where it was yesterday confirmed that he will play no part because of soft tissue damage to his foot			2
@entity0 thinks his side 's opening 15 minutes against @entity19 was their best display since 2008 the much less experienced @entity75 has replaced the @entity76 8			2
he will line up against @entity77 but - despite being connected to @entity79 superstar @entity78 – the @entity80 does not share @entity0 's view about following football 's lead with fixture scheduling			1
' i 've not spoken to @entity78 , ' said @entity77			0
' i 'm not related to him ; our girlfriends are sisters but that 's about it			2
i watch the last couple of games in the football when it gets exciting			0
i would rather have it this way round , but with us playing last			2
it 's not the case this time , but it 's exciting for the players who play the first game , because they can watch the other games and wait in anticipation			1
' @entity78 often sends messages of support for the @entity107 rugby team through @entity108 , while @entity77 's nearest and dearest will also be keeping a close eye on how results unfold			0
if @entity1 go on to win the championship , it will be the first time they have claimed the title outside of @entity115 since 1971 , when @entity116 scored the winning points in a 9 - 5 victory over @entity119 at the @entity120			1
but @entity122 's side are building momentum and , if results over the last two years are any indication , they will be confident of ending the 34 - year wait in the @entity64 capital			1
@entity13 will be without they skipper and talisman @entity60 for the clash against @entity1 in @entity131 wales are slow starters in tournament rugby but , in 2013 and 2014 , they won their final - round tests against @entity20 and @entity136 by 27 and 48 points			1
the famous victory over @entity20 clinched the title for @entity1 , but @entity0 believes winning this year 's championship would be an even sweeter feeling than two years ago			1
' it would beat that year , ' said @entity0			0
' losing to @entity20 at home was hugely disappointing and i think @entity145 hit the nail on the head			0
to beat @entity19 third in the world was fantastic and the defence in the second half was huge			0
the first 15 minutes before @entity152 [ @entity153 ] got injured was best start we have made since 2008			0
' with the race in for the title being so tight , @entity122 has played down the psychological @entity159 significance of finishing on top			0
performances since the opening round defeat by @entity20 have given the @entity163 a settled idea of his squad but , following the long - term injury to @entity153 , the selection saga surrounding @entity168 looks set to rumble on			1
@entity168 has re-iterated that he will not come out of retirement despite @entity153 's recent injury the front - row - who announced his international retirement in january - has been touted as a replacement for @entity153 , but hit back on thursday at claims that he needs to reverse his decision to be re-considered for selection			2
' the one thing i will say is the decision was n't premature , ' @entity168 told @entity181			0
' i had a knock back in the summer , then the autumn , and again in the @entity3 - so it was n't premature			1
hopefully @entity152 will be fit because he 's a great player			0
at the moment the door is pretty shut			0
i 've shut it but i guess it 's up to others to open it			0

the @entity3 has come down to a three - horse race on *saturday*
the last round of fixtures is staggered throughout the day
in the @entity5 , however , all final day matches start at the same time
@entity60 is out of @entity13 's starting line - up for the clash with @entity1
