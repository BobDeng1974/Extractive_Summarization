by @entity0 @entity1 of @entity2 better watch out , there 's a new royal poised to steal her style crown			0
she may have only come to our attention a few short weeks ago , but princess @entity8 has already carved out a name for herself as a royal style icon , showcasing some serious fashion credentials on every single one of her royal engagements			2
the 41 - year - old mother - of - two 's wardrobe of tailored sheath dresses , sky - scraping court shoes and eye - catching jewels is much more daring than the play - it - safe style of the former @entity22			0
her choice of outfit at today 's inauguration of the exhibition ' @entity27 ' ( the last voyage of the @entity29 ) at the @entity30 in @entity31 was case in point			1
@entity34 : princess @entity8 jazzed up her conservative outfit with some snakeskin as she and prince @entity37 visited the @entity38 this afternoon the glamorous former newsreader may have worn a conservative suit but she still showcased her style credentials with a hint of snakeskin			1
the princess showed her wild side with a snakeskin blouse and matching clutch , which she wore under a cream suit and with beige heels			1
she and husband @entity37 were attending @entity49 and @entity51 's jointly organised exhibition			2
style credentials : @entity53 's @entity8 greets visitors during the inauguration of the exhibition ' @entity27 ' ( the last voyage of the @entity29 ) at the @entity30 taking it all in : the fashionable @entity8 strolled around the exhibition , which tells the story of the sinking of the frigate called @entity29 in 1804 animal behaviour : the glamorous former newsreader may have been donning a conservative suit but she still showcased her style credentials with a hint of snakeskin the exhibition tells the story of the sinking of the frigate ( or warship ) called ‘ @entity29 ’ in 1804 , and the tortuous return to @entity53 of its treasure and cargo after a long legal battle			1
the exhibition aims to underline the importance of safeguarding @entity53 's underwater heritage and will explain the historical context and the circumstances of the sinking of the @entity83 ship in 1804			2
since marrying @entity37 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , in 2004 , princess @entity8 wardrobe has undergone a remarkable transformation			1
the @entity53 queen - in - waiting also shares another trait with the @entity94 's future queen : a penchant for homegrown labels and the high street			0
in @entity8 's case , that means slim - fitting sheath dresses picked up in @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 - many of which she wears time and time again			2
watch out , @entity22 ! princess @entity8 may be 41 , but her youthful style gives @entity22 a run for her money youthful glow : the princess has perfectly coiffed hair with soft highlights and shows off a radiant glow despite a hectic schedule royal duties : the exhibition that the couple attended aims to underline the importance of safeguarding @entity53 's underwater heritage and will explain the historical context and the circumstances of the sinking of the @entity83 ship in 1804 that , however , does n't mean she wo n't splash out on a more expensive frock should one catch her eye			1
her favourite piece is reportedly a black guipure lace dress by local designer , @entity129 , which she wore on a state visit to @entity133 in 2012 , again for her 40th birthday party and again in march this year			0
another favourite is a softly fitted yellow and royal purple print dress by @entity138 which made its first appearance in summer 2012 before being dusted off the following year and spruced up with a black blazer			0
off duty , the princess ' style becomes markedly more relaxed , with cropped trousers , billowing shirts and even the odd pair of jeans making up the bulk of her wardrobe			0
but as her occasional foray back into grey @entity138 tailored trousers reveals , some style habits die hard - @entity154 - to - be or not .			0
