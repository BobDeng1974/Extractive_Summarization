mouse lemur mothers - to - be trick multiple males into thinking they are the father of their young , to stop their babies being killed off promiscuous mothers - to - be encourage ‘ sperm wars ’ by tricking multiple partners into thinking they are the father of their young , to stop infants being killed off , scientists claim			1
it is already known that that infanticide by male mammals - from mice to gorillas - is common in species where the females live in social groups dominated by one or a few powerful males			1
but now experts have uncovered the clever strategy used by females of certain species , such as the mouse lemur , to protect their offspring - and over time , their plan leads to infanticide dying out			1
@entity28 researchers compared detailed field observations for 260 mammalian species			1
they explained that when a rival male takes over groups of animals , they will kill infants to make sure they can produce their own offspring			0
to guard against this risk , females mate with as many males as possible in a short amount of time to confuse the paternity of their infants			0
the strategy means that any murderous male risks killing off his own offspring			0
dr @entity47 , from the university ’s department of zoology , explained : ' the finding that females can actually , by mating with multiple males , stop them from killing her offspring , had not been proved before			2
' it had been shown in individual species but it was n’t clear that it was in response to infanticide			0
’ in species such as the mouse lemur , males must concentrate on producing larger quantities of sperm to ensure they can reproduce with lots of females			1
this causes the testis of male mouse lemurs to swell up to 10 times larger than normal in breeding season			1
female bonobo monkeys can mate with every male in the troop of between 10 and 12 to protect their offspring ( stock image )			0
male bonobos have testes that are roughly 15 per cent larger than chimpanzees , who are very closely related and do commit infanticide ‘ in species in which infanticide occurs , testes size increases over generations , suggesting that females are more and more promiscuous to confuse paternity , ’ dr @entity47 explained			1
‘ once sperm competition has become so intense that no male can be certain of his own paternity , infanticide disappears , since males face the risk of killing their own offspring and might not get the benefit of siring the next offspring			2
’ ‘ female mouse lemurs only get sexually receptive on a single night during the whole year			1
‘ on that night she gets chased by all the males who are around , meaning six at a time can pile up trying to mate with her			0
‘ several of them will actually mate with the female and the successful one will be the one who actually gives her the most sperm			0
dr @entity47 explained : ‘ in species in which infanticide occurs , testis size increases over generations , suggesting that females are more and more promiscuous to confuse paternity			2
‘ once sperm competition has become so intense that no male can be certain of his own paternity , infanticide disappears - since males face the risk of killing their own offspring , and might not get the benefit of siring the next offspring			2
’ closely related species that differ in infanticide and testes size include chimpanzees , where the males commit infanticide , versus bonobos , where males have not been observed to kill offspring			2
bonobos have testes that are roughly 15 per cent larger than those of chimpanzees			0
similarly , male @entity132 voles do not commit infanticide and have 50 per cent larger testes compared to infanticidal males of close relatives the @entity138 meadow voles , dr @entity47 added .			0

@entity28 researchers have identified a strategy used by females from certain species to *prevent* infanticide
female creatures such as mouse lemurs mate with multiple partners
they do this to trick males into thinking they *'re* the father of their offspring
males want to carry on their genes in a group so they do *n't* kill the babies
infanticide is common in groups where a few males live with many females
males have to create more sperm to *fertilise* multiple partners and over generations , their sex *organs* become larger
