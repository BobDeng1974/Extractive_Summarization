@entity21 : inflation has risen after the @entity21 re-started its programme of quantitative easing as the government uses september ’s inflation rate to determine the annual increase to benefits and pensions introduced the following april , this paves the way for huge hikes worth almost £ 3.4billion			1

however , the prime minister ’s official spokesman yesterday said that @entity40 - though the september inflation figure and april increase were ‘ usually ’ linked , the ‘ actual decision ’ will not be made until november or december – fuelling fears that ministers are looking for a get - out clause			2
one possibility is that the state pension will be increased in line with expectations , but benefits will not			1
welcome relief : the state pension will rise by £ 8.49 a week for couples @entity51 0.1 % average earnings up 1.8 % @entity53 5.2 % @entity54 5.6 % household expenses up 8.6 % restaurant and hotel bills up 4.7 % clothing prices up 4.4 % communication costs up 0.9 % unemployment rate 8.1 % but @entity62 sources have cast doubt on the likelihood of this scenario , as it would hit the most vulnerable , such as the disabled			1
one insider insisted it could not happen , adding : ‘ there would be uproar			0
’ @entity71 , general secretary of the @entity72 , said the possibility of scrapping an april rise was ‘ very alarming ’			2
the cost of the increase would be an unwelcome burden to a government already battling to control its chaotic accounts inherited from @entity80			1
the respected @entity82 think - tank put the bill for an across - the - board 5.2 per cent rise at around £ 3.4billion , according to account - ants @entity86			1
a @entity88 spokesman said : ‘ the government reconfirmed its policy to change the index used to increase many benefits from @entity54 to @entity53 in the @entity93 in march , and the forecasts for the public finances are based on this assumption			1
energy companies are the new banks			0
they are the objects of enormous public mistrust for very simple reasons			0
household bills are soaring at a time when family incomes are under unprecedented pressure , and despite their protests , the @entity106 energy firms appear to be making fat profits out of it			0
even relatively well - off people are reeling at the size of their bills , and shivering in a thick sweater rather than risk turning up the heating a notch , says @entity116 read more here ‘ benefit rates for april in cash terms are set in the @entity121 , due to be published in december			2
this is exactly the same legislative process as has been followed in previous years			0
’ the @entity122 had published a grim set of figures , with the retail price index hitting 5.6 per cent , its highest level since 1991			1
@entity54 tends to be higher than @entity53 , because it includes mortgage interest payments and council tax – variables not included by @entity53			1
the statistics show that the cost of living is rising faster in @entity132 than in any other country in the @entity134 , excluding @entity135			0
and in a further blow , a former member of the @entity21 ’s interest rate - setting committee , @entity139 , said inflation is likely to rise even higher as the effects of energy price rises filter through the economy			1
the @entity122 already blames power giants ’ double - digit hikes for the considerable increase in inflation			2
it said nearly 70 per cent of last month ’s increase in @entity53 was due to their increases , which have raised the average family ’s annual dual fuel bill to a record high of £ 1,345			0

state workers earning more than £ 21,000 are currently under a pay - freeze			2
