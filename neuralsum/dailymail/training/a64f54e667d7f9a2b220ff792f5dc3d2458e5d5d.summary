by @entity0 @entity1 has said he has unanswered questions about @entity4 's behavior after the murder of her roommate @entity6 in 2007			1
in an interview that aired on @entity9 television , @entity1 said that @entity10 left his house the morning before @entity13 's body was found and when she returned hours later , she seemed ' very agitated '			1
she said her front door had been broken into and that she had found spots of blood in the bathroom			0
' certainly i asked her questions , ' @entity1 said in the interview , which aired in part on the today show on monday			2
' why did you take a shower ? why did she spent so much time there ? ' the interviewer asked what answers he had to these questions			2
@entity44 legal analyst @entity43 said @entity1 seemed to be distancing himself from @entity10 - his girlfriend of just a week at the time of the murder - with these latest comments			1
' he 's saying that there 's some evidence that may apply to her that does n't apply to him , ' she said			0
@entity1 and @entity10 were originally sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison , respectively , for the murder of @entity13 in @entity54 and served four years before being released in 2011			1
upon her release , @entity10 went back to her home in @entity57 , @entity58 and when the case went into retrial last year , she refused to return to @entity9			1
fight : @entity4 posted this image - saying ' we are innocent ' - to @entity63 earlier this month speaking out : in interviews since she was reconvicted in january , @entity10 said she will not return to @entity9 on january 30 , an @entity9 appeals court reconvicted the pair of murdering former roommate @entity13 - a ruling the pair are again appealing			1
' i am frightened and saddened by this unjust verdict , ' @entity10 wrote after the ruling			0
' having been found innocent before , i expected better from the @entity9 justice system			2
' @entity1 did appear in court for the appeal and , after they were reconvicted , he was found in a hotel near the @entity9 border before having his passport revoked			2
earlier this month , @entity10 denied claims that her ex-boyfriend was trying to distance himself from her			2
the day after the murder : both @entity10 's defense team and the attorneys for @entity1 argued that they were in his apartment on the night of @entity6 's murder writing on her blog , she said : ' it has been claimed that , in this most recent round of closing arguments and in interviews since the latest guilty verdict , @entity1 and his defense attorneys have finally betrayed their resentment and started to put distance between him and me legally and personally			1
victim : @entity6 was found killed in the apartment she shared with @entity10 in 2007 ' this is not the case			1
actually , attorney @entity104 ’s closing arguments and @entity1 ’s latest statements pinpoint and attack a fundamental weakness in the prosecution ’s case against both @entity1 and me that has been ignored for far too long : @entity1 is not a slave			0
' she added : ' @entity1 has plenty of reason for resentment , but not against me			0
the only reason he has been dragged into this is because he happens to be my alibi			0
' she said @entity1 had recently e-mailed her backing up her stance			0
she said he told her : ' i do n’t want to be punished for , nor have to continue to justify , those things that regard you and not me			0
' obviously the evidence demonstrates both of our innocence , but it seems that for the judges and the people this objectivity is of no importance			0
' of his role in the case , she said : ' he is collateral damage in the unreasonable , irresponsible and unrelenting scapegoating of the prosecution ’s grotesque caricature that is " @entity4 "			0
' @entity10 's blog post came as she released a grim portrait of herself on her @entity143 feed that shows her holding up a sign declaring her innocence in @entity9			1
the 26 - year - old is shown in a black - and - white photo , holding a piece of paper with the words ' @entity150 ' which translates to ' we are innocent '			1
