by @entity0 last updated at 4:16 pm on 17th october 2011 cleaning up : gels first appeared in @entity3 bathrooms in the @entity4			1
today some 200million bottles are sold in @entity3 every year whoever invented shower gel must lie awake at night — no doubt in a gold - plated , four - poster bed — chuckling at the audacity of it all			1
here is a product that is expensive , packed full of man - made chemicals , difficult to use and wasteful			0
and yet , thanks to the persuasive power of marketing , bottles of it sit proudly in almost every bathroom in the land			0
once , we cleaned ourselves with bars of long - lasting soap that cost the equivalent of a few pence a week			0
today , more than eight out of ten people wash themselves with gels costing up to £ 4 a bottle			1
not that shower gel manufacturers admit they are involved in the business of washing , of course			1
instead , they sell their wares as revitalising foams , honey shower milks and rebalancing body experiences			0
@entity41 ’s @entity40 is , it claims , designed to help you wake up in the morning			0
@entity44 ’s @entity43 is supposed to send you to sleep			0
you will struggle to find a shower gel that admits what it is really intended for : as a way of removing dirt , sweat and grease			1
long gone are the days of explicit adverts for @entity54 — the soap that said ‘ no to @entity56 ’			0
but if @entity3 has gone crazy for shower gel , with an estimated 200 million bottles sold in the @entity3 each year , there are signs of rebellion			1
former @entity63 mp , television presenter and newspaper columnist @entity65 recently went on the offensive			0
in a passionate attack against pointless toiletries , he highlighted the design flaws of shower gels			1
gels have come a long way since @entity73 , the makers of @entity41 for a long time regarded as the traditional hard soap for middle - class families he pointed out that most of the bottles do n’t stand upright on curved soap dishes , or they leak when hanging from their plastic hooks			1
they are difficult to open , easy to spill and hard to apply ( how do you use shower gel to wash your feet ? ) and most of the gel squirted into the user ’s hands slides to the floor to be washed down the drain			1
@entity65 — who stopped using shampoo years ago and who claims his hair has never been cleaner — estimates that millions of gallons of gel are washed away unused every year			1
despite these flaws , @entity3 ’s love affair with shower gel is going strong			1
@entity101 , at last count , had 94 brands on sale , each with its own name , ingredients and unique smell			1
most sane people would struggle to come up with 94 different conventional fragrances for toiletries			1
but the clever people at @entity112 and @entity73 have got round that by persuading consumers that what they really want to smell like is food : thus we can wash ourselves with chocolate and @entity119 shower gel , @entity121 shower creme , or @entity123 shower scrubs			1
evidently , gels have come a long way since @entity73 , the makers of @entity41 — for a long time regarded as the traditional hard soap for middle - class families — introduced its first ‘ @entity130 ’ in 1978			1
former @entity63 mp @entity65 recently highlighted the design flaws of shower gels gels were , in part , a response to a change in bathroom habits that saw showers growing in popularity as our lives became busier and we all became more aware of the need to use water sparingly			1
but the rise of shower gels ca n’t be explained simply by the move from the twice - weekly bath to the daily shower			1
after all , showers had already become a staple of homes by the @entity4 , and for at least a decade after that , most people were happy with soap — or occasionally the more exotic ‘ soap on a rope ’			2
the secret of their success lies in the fact that while they are cheap to manufacture , they are easy to brand as a luxury			0
by selling them as modern , convenient and indulgent , cosmetic companies cleaned up			0
while the secret of soap - making goes back to at least the @entity170 in 2800 @entity171 , when animal fat was mixed with the ashes of wood fires and melted , the first liquid soap — the forerunner of today ’s shower gels — was patented in 1865			2
modern gels are more complicated to make			2
but their basic ingredient , a detergent that sticks to grease and water , is similar to the detergent in hard soap bars			0
in order to remain thick , perfumed and coloured , a typical shower gel must contain around 20 chemicals , some man - made , others derived from plants			2
it will have a couple of plant - based detergents , an array of perfumes , salt to thicken it , glycerine — a clear , sticky liquid used in cough mixtures and icing on cakes — to make the gel silky , film - forming agents , lactic acid ( found in sour milk to counteract the alkali and make it @entity204 - neutral ) , preservatives , agents that reduce static in human hair and natural plant extracts			2
most of these plant extracts have very little practical purpose and are just for marketing purposes so that the gels can have fancy names			2
and marketing is what it is all about			0
from the earliest days of industrially produced soap , manufacturers realised that to sell more soap , they needed to persuade @entity3 to become more ‘ hygienic ’ : the more people washed , the bigger the profits			2
so it should n’t come as a surprise that some of the earliest and most successful advertising campaigns were for soaps			0
costly : today , more than eight out of ten people wash themselves with gels costing up to £ 4 a bottle the @entity232 company @entity231 created @entity54 in 1895 and sold it as an antiseptic soap			1
the company also invented the term bo for body odour			0
@entity235 devised a sophisticated transparent soap and launched the yearly search for @entity235			0
yet no marketing campaign for soap was enough to fend off the advance of shower gels			2
those who prefer gels say they are happy to put up with the extra expense for the sake of convenience : unlike soap , they do n’t leave scum or mess around the shower , and small amounts go a long way			2
but for many , they are a victory of marketing over common sense			0
one of the @entity3 ’s top marketing gurus , who has worked with many gel manufacturers , said : ‘ most of the differences between brands are trivial in terms of what they do functionally — removing dirt and grease			1
‘ but the real difference — and this is the genius of marketing — is how those small differences , like the fragrance and the associations that come with that fragrance , can be used to create something more than the product			0
‘ that value to the brand is real			0
if a product has associations of being refreshing in the morning or relaxing in the evening , it can be a genuine bonus for the consumer ; it might help people feel relaxed or refreshed			2
‘ some of that association is intrinsic in the ingredients of gel , but much of it is created through advertising			1
’ so are we being taken for a ride by the marketing types ? the answer is probably yes			0
but then , how many of us would really want to go back to using half a bar of soap in the shower when we could be reaching for a bottle of that oh - so fragrant @entity295 @entity40 ?			0
