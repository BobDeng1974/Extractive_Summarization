with 100 billion neurons and 37 trillion cells , the human body is simply too complex to be artificially designed by modern computers			2
but in the quest to create artificial life , what if we started a lot smaller ? that ’s what team of scientists has done , creating a replica of the simplest form of life we know			1
the worm @entity16 has just 300 neurons and around 1,000 cells - and now a robot has been created that mimics the actions of this simple organism			1
their project is recreating the neurons and cells in @entity16 , the simplest organism we know of			1
by making a digital worm the team hope to create artificial life			1
they have implanted the digital ' mind ' of the worm into a @entity37 machine ( shown ) the @entity24 project , a global effort including researchers from the @entity41 and @entity42 , is attempting to create the world ’s first digital animal			1
earlier this year they ran a successful @entity47 campaign to fund the creation of a worm you can download onto your computer			2
the @entity16 nematode is only around 0.04 inches ( 1mm ) in length , is transparent and feeds on bacteria , such as @entity56			2
it moves around in water at a rate of about 0.04 inches ( 1mm ) per second			0
despite being composed of just 1,000 cells , the creature exhibits relatively advanced behaviour such as finding a mate and avoiding predators			0
the worm has been the focus of huge amounts of research and was the first multi-celled organism to have its entire genome mapped			2
and they have also created a robot that mimics the actions of a real - life worm			2
@entity16 is one of the simplest forms of life we know , thanks to its limited neurons and cells , and thus researchers have been able to accurately map its body			1
the worm , though simple , contains 80 per cent of the same genes as humans and can be studied as a more basic version of complex life			2
with a brain , stomach and bodily functions , the worm has provided scientists with a way to study life on a much smaller and more manageable scale			0
in this latest project the researchers mapped the entire physiology of a @entity16 organism			1
they then recreated the worm ’s brain , cells and more in digital form , complete with neurons ‘ firing ’ to make decisions			1
earlier this year the @entity24 project ran a successful digital campaign to fund their digital worm ( shown )			1
next year people will be able to buy and download their own worm for use on computers			1
the artificial creature accurately recreates the cells and neurons in a real @entity16 worm in a recent comment on futrology site @entity119 , @entity121 and @entity123 chief @entity122 warned of the dangers of artificial intelligence			1
in his comment he feared that the risk of ‘ something seriously dangerous happening ’ could be in as few as five years			0
although he does n’t go into detail , he alludes to ‘ digital superintelligences ’ and internet bots as being among the potential problems facing humanity			0
in the comment he says the pace of progress in @entity138 is ‘ incredibly fast ’			0
he continued : ‘ i am not alone in thinking we should be worried			0
‘ the leading @entity138 companies have taken great steps to ensure safety			0
‘ they recognise the danger , but believe that they can shape and control the digital superintelligences and prevent bad ones from escaping into the internet			0
that remains to be seen … ’ the ultimate goal of the project is to give people access to their own digital worm called @entity154 to study on their computers through the @entity24 project			1
following the successful @entity47 campaign , this should be available next year			0
but they have also inserted the artificial brain of the worm into a @entity37 machine , specifically a @entity165 robot			1
by recreating the 302 neurons and 959 cells of this tiny nematode worm , the robot can then be left to ‘ mimic ’ the actions of a real - life worm			1
this means it moves around , runs into obstacles like walls and also turns			0
the robot is very basic for now , and does not possess the ability to perform more complex functions such as eating			0
it ’s an important step , though , to creating artificial life that can think for itself			1
while this worm is a very basic form of life , it may be a precursor to making much more complex animals			2
this will be a huge undertaking , though - even a mouse has 22 million neurons in its brain			0
‘ the mere act of trying to put a working model together causes us to realise what we know and what we do n't know , ’ @entity190 , a roboticist and neuroscientist at @entity192 in @entity193 , told @entity194			0
the caenorhabditis elegans nematode ( scanning electron microscope image shown ) is only around 0.04 inches ( 1mm ) in length , is transparent and feeds on bacteria , such as @entity56			0
the worm has been the focus of huge amounts of research and was the first multi-celled organism to have its entire genome mapped creating an aritifical brain ( stock image left ) is viewed as being the first step to creating artificial intelligence			2
some experts even believe that the key to one day inhabiting far away planets is to get rid of the body altogether , such as how cartoon villain @entity218 ( right ) , from @entity219 , did			0

the @entity24 global project is making a ' digital ' worm
their project is recreating the neurons and cells in @entity16
it is the simplest organism we know of but has *similarities* to humans
by making a digital worm the team hope to create artificial life
they have implanted the digital ' mind ' of the worm into a @entity37 machine
in a video it acts and behaves just like the worm would in the real world
next year the team will allow people to download their own digital worm
