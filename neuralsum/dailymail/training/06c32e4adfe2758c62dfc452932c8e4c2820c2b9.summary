by @entity0 last updated at 5:34 pm on 8th november 2011 a surgeon who uses laser surgery to boost women 's sex lives faces being struck off for damaging five patients			1
professor @entity6 - who has pioneered the use of lasers for cosmetic genital surgery - is due to appear before the @entity10 next week			1
the 68 - year - old who claims he has helped hundreds of women patients over the last three years , has been suspended for 18 months while his case was investigated			1
some women resort to vagina rejuvenation after childbirth because loosening of the vaginal canal can affect how much they enjoy sex ( posed ) he practised at several major private hospitals in @entity23 and two years ago hit the headlines with an injection designed to enlarge the g spot			1
the jab is said to increase the number of orgasms experienced by a woman by making it easier for their partners to hit the target			2
but professor @entity6 's main work was in the controversial area of ' vaginal rejuvenation ' using a laser treatment developed in the @entity40			1
his operations cost as much as Â£ 6,000			2
some doctors believe that such surgery should be banned			2
many of @entity6 's patients were women who wanted their sex lives restored following difficult childbirth while others were concerned about the external appearance of their genitals			1
professor @entity6 claims that he has been suspended on the basis of one complaint from a patient who had undergone cosmetic surgery on her labia			1
he said : ' she was n't happy with the aesthetic result of the operation			0
this type of surgery is very personal and i always offer further surgery without charge if the end result was n't quite what was wanted			0
' but the @entity10 's case is that he harmed a number of patients and also worked without medical insurance			1
professor @entity6 's case will come before the @entity10 on 14th november he is charged with not obtaining consent for labial surgery from one patient , not telling her about risks and complications and leaving her scarred			1
he is alleged to have operated ' inappropriately ' on another lady and with a third failed to manage post surgery complications			0
another patient suffered a punctured uterus and fifth was left in pain after ' inappropriate ' surgery			0
professor @entity6 - a gynaecologist and obstetrician - runs the @entity86 @entity85 from rooms in @entity23 's @entity88			1
the vagina can often loosen after childbirth which can decrease enjoyment of sex			0
the cosmetic procedure involves using a laser to tighten the muscles in the vaginal canal			0
it is a non-invasive procedure that takes one to two hours			0
it is said to cause less scarring than a scalpel and cautery machine as it can both cut and seal blood vessels			0
recovery time is eight weeks on average but women can return to work after a week			0
it is performed in a number of clinics in the @entity40 , but professor @entity6 was the only one to offer it in the @entity86			1
his website states : ' the majority of operations performed at the @entity86 @entity85 are on women post childbirth suffering from vaginal prolapse resulting in urinary stress incontinence			0
' procedures are available to rejuvenate the structures of the vagina to their pre-pregnancy state and for women with no children , aesthetic solutions are available through cosmetic procedures			0
' professor @entity6 said : ' i was shocked that the @entity10 decided to suspend me			1
they have presented no serious evidence that i am a risk to patients			2
' the expert witness who they used to criticise my surgery is n't even qualified in laser surgery so ca n't judge my results			0
' he claimed : ' i have lots of satisfied women patients since i started using a laser for this type of surgery			2
i have carried out more than 250 operations using the laser and there have been no complaints			0
' quite a lot of patients have surgery because childbirth has affected their sex lives or even caused medical problems like urinary incontinence			1
' i have had lots of compliments from patients who have said my surgery has transformed their lives			2
' i have practised in this country for 40 years and have never had any complaints by patients to the @entity10			1
' a leading private dentist - who had ' vaginal rejuvenation ' carried out by @entity6 claimed the surgeon had done a ' fantastic job ' for her and been ' very caring and attentive '			1
she said : ' i have birth to four strapping kids and as a result things below got out of shape			0
' it affected my sex life and gave me urinary incontinence			0
professor @entity6 used his laser technique and he transformed my life			1
i ca n't speak to highly of him			0
' i was so happy with the result that i would speak to other women who were considering the surgery			0
i was shocked to hear that professor @entity6 had been suspended and i 've written to the @entity10 supporting him			1
' one of his anaesthetists from the world - famous @entity177 wrote a testimonial to the @entity10 describing @entity6 's work surgical work as " painstaking " and " caring " and that he was particularly concerned about the safe use of the laser			1
despite practising in @entity88 and at some of @entity23 's top private hospitals , three time married professor @entity6 , lives alone in a modest two up two down terraced house in @entity187 , @entity23 and drives a 20 year - old @entity188			1
he claimed : ' i do n't make a lot of money by the time i 've paid for the operating theatre and an anaesthetist			0
i also ' redo ' some operations if patients are n't totally happy			2
' i 'm not in private practice to make a fortune			1
i take lot of time with my patients			2
this is intimate surgery and give patients a lot of my time to make sure they are happy			2
' and i generally do n't charge for this			0
i want patients to be happy with surgery and i wo n't charge if they think the final result is not quite right			2
' just days before his suspension in march last year he was giving a lecture on laser surgery at the @entity213			0
@entity214 - born @entity6 - who gained his medical degree in @entity216 - trained up to consultant level in the @entity218 before going into private practice in the 1980s			1
at one stage he ran a fertility clinic in @entity222 , @entity223 which went bust			0
a leading consultant gynaecologist who specialises in the same sort of surgery , but without laser , said : ' this is a difficult area of surgery , particularly when you operate on external genitalia			2
the end result is very personal			0
' professor @entity6 has an additional problem because he is the only surgeon in this country using the laser for this type of work			1

@entity10 's case is that professor @entity6 harmed a number of patients and worked without medical insurance
professor @entity6 is from @entity214 , gained his medical degree in @entity216 , trained up to consultant level in the @entity218 then went into private practice
