dr @entity7 gave the kiss of life to the jaguar cub , christened @entity11 , after it was found not to be breathing following a rare caesarean at a vet clinic in @entity14 , @entity15			1

he said : ‘ the experience of seeing an animal start living and breathing after our help is really amazing			0
’ the operation involved a team of 12 vets , nurses and assistants , and began well when they successfully deliverered a young male			0
however , it was soon found not to be breathing and they began to perform cpr to kickstart its tiny heart			0
they then began using a pump to force air into its lungs and when that failed dr @entity7 incredibly began mouth to mouth resuscitation			2
when little @entity11 failed to start breathing following the surgery , one veterinarian resorted to giving mouth - to - mouth to bring him back to life heroes : a vet , believed to be @entity7 , poses with the cub 's mother @entity16 before the caesarean the battle begins : @entity11 , pictured shortly after being removed from his mother 's womb , was stillborn and the team struggled to get him to start breathing after a frantic eight minutes the team were relieved to find a heartbeat			1
they then made sure to dry the cub , who has since been named @entity11 , and keep it warm as it recovered from the traumatic birth			2
mr @entity28 said : ‘ @entity11 could have died in eight minutes if it was not for the efforts of the team			2
‘ i do not have words to explain the emotion			0
i 'm really happy with my team 's work and we got a great reward			0
‘ many of the workers are mothers themselves and they have a special sensibility to newborns			0
’ following surgery , @entity16 has now been returned to a local zoo where she lives with her mate , tango			0
@entity11 is being hand - raised at another , smaller zoo as he can not be returned to his potentially dangerous mother			1
