a mysterious case of nine experienced skiers who died in bizarre circumstances on an expedition into @entity4 may have been solved by an @entity6 researcher			2
@entity7 , a film - maker and author , spent four years investigating the so - called @entity9 , and has now claimed that he has discovered a ' scientific ' explanation for the baffling case			1
the skiers , who were all students , were led into the wilderness of the @entity15 mountains by 23 - year - old @entity9			0
rescuers sent out into the -24 - degree weather to track the party down at first found only a collapsed tent , still filled with all the clothing and survival gear needed to make the rest of the journey			2
but the empty tent baffled investigators , as it still contained items of clothing and pairs of shoes - implying that some of the students had ventured out into the wilderness barefoot and without coats			2
even when later searches uncovered the frozen bodies of all nine victims , no convincing explanation could be found for why the experienced hikers - who would have been well - versed in winter survival techniques - had come to such a tragic end			2
search parties found one group of bodies lying in the snow on flat land near a river , a mile from the tent , next to the remains of a long burnt - out fire			1
around 350 yards away lay the corpse of @entity64 , the engineering student from @entity65 who had put the expedition together and was its leader			0
his name would later be given to the area where the tragedy took place , as well as the incident itself			0
nearby , a search dog sniffed out the remains of @entity21 , 22 , under four inches of snow , and then that of @entity79			0
the bodies were in a line 200 yards apart , as if they had been trying to crawl behind each other back up to the shelter of the tent , but never made it			0
eerie : the tent as the rescuers found it on february 26 , 1959 , which had been cut open from inside another two months went by before the rest of the group were found , under 15ft of snow in a den they had desperately hollowed out for themselves before succumbing to the cold			1
some of this group had broken bones and terrible internal injuries but , strangely , no external wounds , not even scratches on the skin			0
post-mortem examinations of all nine bodies threw their own anomalies , as some bodies were fully clothed , others almost naked			0
@entity108 , belonging to @entity109 was missing her tongue and eyes			0
an investigation by a @entity114 government inspector was also fruitless , and was quietly dropped after concluding nobody was to blame			1
@entity116 , the inspector , concluded only that all nine deaths had been caused by what he described as ‘ an unknown elemental force which they were unable to overcome ’			0
striking camp : the skiers setting up camp on february 2 , 1959 in a photo taken from a roll of film found by investigators experienced skiers : @entity9 , centre , hugging @entity130 as he prepares to leave the group due to illness , which saved his life as he left the expedition before the deaths but in a recent interview with @entity138 , mr @entity7 hinted at his conclusion , saying : ' the conclusion that i have come up with could only have happened with the help of modern science and the help of the @entity145			1
' @entity146 , who interviewed mr @entity7 , also wrote that his theory : ' involves a particular type of repetitive wind event ( one that could be produced by the topography of @entity151 ) , which in turn might have triggered panic - inducing infrasound			1
' mr @entity7 has stayed tight - lipped about the specifics , but said the original investigator : ' could n’t explain what happened because he lacked the science and technology to do so			1
' the ' infrasound ' theory to which the interviewer refers is a bizarre - but apparently plausible - explanation which argues that sound waves too low to hear could have subtly affected the minds of the skiers , panicking them and causing them to rush recklessly out into the snow , where the cold killed them			2
these waves of infrasound , it seems , could have been produced by high winds resonating thanks to the shape of the mountains			0
studied have suggested that infrasound - soundwaves too low for humans to hear - can nonetheless produce feelings of unease , awe or even terror which can not be explained any other way			1
it is unclear how far this explanation matches mr @entity7 's - but supporters of the theory claim it can account for the bizarre situation in which the bodies were found .			1

@entity7 said discovered the secret in an interview about his new book
a probe by the @entity114 government at the time was *inconclusive* , and other researchers have been baffled by the *famous* case for decades
bodies of the experienced explorers were found under the snow
some had been *unclothed* , while their tent was left *immaculate* except for signs of it having been cut open from the inside
interview hints that mr @entity7 's theory may be to do with ' infrasound ' - *extremely* low - pitched noise which studies claim causes irrational terror
