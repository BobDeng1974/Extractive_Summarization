one member of the public dies at the hands of the police in @entity5 every day , the @entity0 can reveal			2
since the start of the year , officers from the island ’s notoriously corrupt force have killed someone every 24 hours			1
the shocking figure comes after a local newspaper last weekend alleged there are ‘ police death squads ’ operating in the country			1
similar accusations have been around since the 1980s			0
@entity17 has called for an urgent inquiry into the fresh claims , which have been denied by senior officers			1
starling figures have revealed @entity5 police forces have killed one person a day since the start of 2014			1
police patrol the streets of @entity27 in 2010 after two officers were killed a former @entity30 murder squad chief is already conducting an independent investigation into dozens of fatal police shootings in @entity5 – more than half of which are said to be suspicious			1
ex detective chief superintendent @entity35 moved there six months ago , shortly after retiring from the @entity37			1
he describes the number of police killings on the island as ‘ just incredible ’			1
in response to claims of death squads in the @entity44 he told the @entity0 there was a widespread belief that the police were killing people because they knew they would n’t get them into court			1
‘ there is a widespread belief that the police are killing people who ca n’t otherwise get to the courts. , ' he said			2
' the courts have huge backlogs			0
trials are years and years behind			0
some cases are dismissed by the courts , because the police evidence is simply not up to scratch			0
' it is difficult finding people who are brave enough to sit on juries			0
generally speaking , the police say they ‘ all the people we shoot are criminals , they have guns , we have an encounter with them and they are killed ’ , ’ said mr @entity35			1
‘ but the obsessive deadly force does not match up with the witness testimony in many of the cases			1
’ ‘ a long - term culture has developed ( in the police ) that these judicial killings will cleanse the ranks of criminals			1
it is a completely unacceptable and inappropriate approach to take			0
’ armed police enter @entity82 in may 2010			0
this year 's figures reveal a rise in the number of people killed by officers since last year mr @entity35 described a ' long - term culture ' in which police officers are accused of killing criminals who ca n't get to court			1
above , officers in @entity27 tote guns while patrolling streets and stopping citizens mr @entity35 pointed out the differences between the island 's police force and that of @entity98 where the shooting of @entity100 by metropolitan police sparked riots and an inquest and he points out that the police ’s method is not working as the murder rate on the @entity108 island is as high as ever			1
mr @entity35 , who led a series of high - profile @entity37 investigations including those into the murder of @entity114 presenter @entity113 and the ‘ spy in the bag ’ death of @entity118 agent @entity117 , added : ‘ around 1,100 people were murdered in @entity5 ( population 3million ) last year			1
‘ i can put that into context by saying that across the whole of @entity98 ( population around 8 - 9million ) , there were 100 murders in the year before i left			0
’ at the current rate , the number of people killed by police on the @entity108 island this year could surpass the 258 of 2013			1
that figure – which included 40 people in october alone – represented a sharp rise on deaths in the previous two years			0
in 2012 , 219 people were killed by police while the corresponding figure for 2011 was 210			2
mr @entity35 , 56 , knows he and his team of 37 investigators at @entity5 ’s @entity142 – a watchdog set up in 2010 – are facing an enormous challenge as they bid to bring down the number of people killed by police			1
@entity35 ( left ) said he was not concerned for his safety but for that of his investigators within @entity150			2
his team are pictured in @entity152 , @entity27 after two men were killed by police after 40 people were killed in october last year , mr @entity156 s watchdog held a press conference to express concerns about the wave of shootings , which only merited three paragraphs in a leading local newspaper since he arrived on the island , six police officers have been charged with murder and he is aware that in a country where a contract killing can cost as little as £ 12 , his job is not without its risks			1
he said : ‘ i am not worried about my own safety			0
i am more concerned about my investigators			0
’ last year all but 13 of the 258 people killed by the police were shot			2
the majority of those who died could be described as criminals , with some record or other , said mr @entity35			2
he said the people killed by police ‘ are generally unemployed , criminals , individuals convicted or acquitted at court			2
they are not middle - class @entity5			0
‘ individuals who give evidence against corrupt officers have also been killed , as have completely innocent people gunned down by mistake			0
’ mr @entity35 described the stark contrast between policing in @entity98 and the @entity108 island			1
former detective superintendent @entity35 described the situation as ' just incredible ' he said : ‘ i was watching the aftermath of the @entity100 inquest in @entity98 on tv			1
i thought it was quite interesting how people reacted to one single shooting by the police , which admittedly caused a riot , but which inquest jurors decided was a lawful killing			0
' i saw how the commissioner of the @entity37 went on tv and there was a lot of media interest in the case			0
‘ i almost wrote to sir @entity210 , because the @entity212 case had all the hallmarks of an accountable shooting – an audit trail , video recording , statements and evidence of police planning and it all came before an inquest to be explained and in that case justified			0
‘ over here , in the first 13 days of january , we had 13 people shot dead by the police			0
‘ but very little , if anything is said			0
there is no police response , there is no coroner ’s inquest			0
the level of response , or lack of it , is simply alarming			0
‘ @entity150 was established by the government here to redress the @entity5 police investigating themselves and to try to bring down – through training and education and examination of police practices – the level of shootings			0
’ after 40 people were killed in october last year , mr @entity35 ’s watchdog held a press conference to express concerns about the wave of shootings			2
it merited only three paragraphs in a leading local newspaper – a sign , perhaps , of how even the media in @entity5 are not shocked by the frequency of police killings			1
at a public meeting in november , he spoke of his frustration that three years after his watchdog was set up , many in the police still oppose the crackdown on shootings			2
‘ in the @entity265 and elsewhere , an independent body is just that , it sets out to investigate on behalf of the public matters of death , brutality , all sorts of things and does n't allow the police service to interfere with the laws which have been settled , ’ he added .			2
