by @entity0 abandoned by her owners at just two months old and born with two paralysed front legs , @entity1 had a tough start to life life			1
the @entity7 and @entity8 cross was moments from death after being discovered by an animal control officer who scheduled for her to be euthanised after no owners came forward			1
however , at the last minute she was saved by a home 4 ever rescue center , in @entity15 , @entity16 , and staff nursed her back to health and even raised money to buy her a sparkly pink wheelchair			1
@entity30 said : ' i am so proud and happy to see @entity1 being mobile			2
without the cart , she hops like a bunny and that consumes a lot of energy for her , so the wheels mean we can go on longer walks			0
' @entity1 can do everything that a normal dog can , except to climb up and down the stairs or jump on something high			2
' she is able to live a happy life with us and is quite active , despite her disability			0
' vets have no idea what caused @entity1 's disability , though it is believed she was born with the condition , which may have led to her being abandoned			1
staff at the centre nursed @entity1 back to health and bought a pink sparkly wheelchair to help her get around seven months after being found @entity1 was adopted by @entity30 and now enjoys going for long walks within a few months of arriving at a home 4 ever , @entity1 got her new wheels but did n't feel comfortable with them at first and would only use them if a treat was dangled in front of her			1
@entity30 said : ' we have later learned that it was due to the cart not fitting properly			0
' after adjusting the wheel cart , she adapted to it very quickly and we all enjoy taking long walks , which was not possible before			0
' after the readjustments to her cart @entity1 and @entity30 get to meet new furry friends , although some of them are wary of her ' different ' appearance			2
' the cart has even helped boost her confidence when meeting new dogs , ' said @entity30			0
' having said that each dog reacts differently to @entity1 - some just accept her and greet her like any other dog			2
without her wheelchair , @entity1 hops on her hind legs in order to get around which uses up a lot of energy meaning she can not walk far			1
but with her new wheels she can take leisurely walks along with other dogs @entity30 says @entity1 was reluctant to use her cart at first because it did n't fit properly , but after having it readjusted she quickly go used to it and now takes to it with ease ' some are frightened by her wheels and run away and a few bark every time she makes any movement			1
' but @entity1 does n't really seem to mind how dogs react to her and she wheels along in her own happy little world			1
' it 's not just canine chums who notice @entity1 when she 's strutting her stuff out and about @entity30 said : ' @entity1 does get quite a bit of attention from people , and she loves it			0
' i am often asked about her and if they can photograph her during our walks			0
@entity30 says that while most dogs do n't seem to mind @entity1 's wheels , some are frightened and run away ' it 's great when people take an interest in @entity1 because that allows us to raise positive awareness for the special needs			1
' it saddens me when people see @entity1 and tell us how sad it is that she has to live with a disability			0
' by sharing @entity1 's story , we hope to show people that disabled dogs are not as fragile as people may think they are			0
' they are highly adaptable , can live happy lives , and most importantly , love you unconditionally			0
