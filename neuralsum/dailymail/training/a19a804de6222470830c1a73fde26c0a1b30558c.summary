' i ’m here with @entity16 , our escape route has been cut off , ' @entity11 , the leader of the group , tells supervisors over the radio			1
' we are preparing a deployment site and we are burned out around ourselves in the brush and i ’ll give you a call when we are under the she - the shelters			0
' it was the group 's last transmission			2
experts say that at that time the fire had entirely surrounded the 19 firefighters and that they likely knew they were going to die			1
the footage comes from a helmet cam of a firefighter who was far removed from the hotshots - but the microphone pics up the radio traffic of the group 's final moments			1
all 19 of the hotshots - firefighters from the @entity58 , @entity5 , @entity59 , were killed after the inferno overtook them as they huddled in their fire shelters			1
the tragedy made it the deadliest fire in more than two decades and the most firefighters to die fighting a wildfire since 1933			2
@entity67 , a retired @entity68 deputy chief , told the @entity69 - which first published the video , that the hotshots realized that they were all going to die			2
one one member of the @entity34 survived , a firefighter who was stationed as lookout on a nearby ridge ' the sobriety of the last transmission is quite telling , ' he said			1
they knew that this was the end			0
they had to get in their shelters - that was the last gasp			0
' before the last transmission , @entity11 - the hotshots leader - spent two minutes pleading with dispatchers to send water tankers to douse the flames in the area			1
' breaking in on @entity5 16 , @entity34 , we are in front of the flaming front , ' he transmits			1
' @entity95 to ground 16 , @entity96 , @entity97 , how do you read ? ' @entity11 asks three times for planes and helicopters to attack the fire that was surrounding them			2
the air - to - ground controller responsible for dispatching the air support does n't realize the urgency of the hotshots ' situation for at least two minutes			1
' okay , i was copying a little bit of that , uh conversation uh , on air to ground			0
we ’re - we ’ll do the best we can , ' the dispatcher says			0
' we got the type 1 helicopters ordered back in			0
uh , we ’ll see what we can do			0
