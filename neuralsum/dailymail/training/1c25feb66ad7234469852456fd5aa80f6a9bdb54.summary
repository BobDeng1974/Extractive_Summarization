@entity0 was under increased pressure last night to explain why it broadcast a quiz featuring obscene jokes about the @entity4 just minutes after the 9pm watershed			1
the @entity6 told yesterday how viewers were outraged by the antics of drunken comedians on the @entity10 of 2012 , presented by controversial comic @entity11 on sunday			1
tv watchdog @entity12 has already received complaints about the pre-recorded show and the countless vile sexual jokes told by stand - up star @entity16 and actor @entity17			1
featured guests included @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity11 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity28 anger : comedian @entity16 and actor @entity17 were behind many of the offensive remarks on @entity0 's @entity10 of the year 2012 they included puerile remarks about the @entity4 and the @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			1
lord @entity37 , the chairman of @entity0 , last night refused to comment on the broadcast			1
@entity40 's most successful comedian , @entity39 , has stuck the knife into @entity0 , as they face huge criticism over their @entity10 of 2012			1
speaking before the show was broadcast , @entity39 , 70 , accused modern ' gurning ' comics of killing stand - up because ' @entity0 - type ' comedians prefer to grab tv chat show spots instead of working on new material			1
@entity39 , who was voted most influential stand - up ever in a poll last year , fumed : ' when i see all these @entity55 guys who all hang out together at the @entity56 and all that , i 'm really glad i 'm not one of them			1
' they call jokes " gags "			2
i do n't talk like that			0
' i do n't want to be like them , @entity0 - type comedy people			1
' they have this drive and i 'm glad i do n't have it			0
' like , you must be seen at @entity69 until you 're 99			0
' look at him , is n't he great ! ' no , he 's not great			0
' i listen to them on the radio at the @entity73 , but i would n't darken its door			0
' i think stand - up comedy is in danger			1
' stand - ups spend their time gurning on panel shows in the hope of one day being given a chat show			1
' after the @entity6 attempted to speak to him at his home and over the telephone a member of the @entity0 press office told us he would not be commenting and asked us to stop contacting him			1
@entity88 , the chief executive of @entity0 , was also unable to comment because he was on holiday in @entity90 , we were told			1
now @entity91 mp @entity37 , a member of the @entity92 , is demanding to know why the quiz was broadcast as early as 9pm			1
he said : ‘ i actually watched some of the broadcast because we are staying with family for the holidays and i found it quite distasteful			1
' i walked into the other room			0
sadly this sort of gauche , vulgar “ anything goes humour ” that appeals to the lowest common denominator in society is becoming more common			0
‘ i just wonder , given everything that has been going on in the media over the last six months , what has happened to editorial judgment and reason			0
‘ it was base , unfunny comedy and in some ways i thought its greater crime really was that it just was n’t funny			0
‘ in my role on the committee i will be writing to @entity0 and asking for its editorial explanation for broadcasting such unpleasant output so soon after the watershed			1
’ former @entity121 and @entity122 , 34 , and @entity123 - educated @entity16 , 24 , were seen to get drunk on red wine during the quiz which was shown between 9pm and 10.30pm			2
their infantile behaviour was egged on by @entity27 , 52 , who left the @entity128 after making an abusive phone call to actor @entity130 during a radio show			0
@entity0 has been accused of failing to learn the lessons from the @entity134 scandal which was also pre-recorded and cleared before broadcast on the @entity136 radio show			1
criticism : mp @entity37 , member of the @entity139 , said he watched part of the programme and found it ' distasteful ' last night the @entity0 quiz , which attracted an audience of 2.5million , was coming under increased criticism from viewers via the internet and social networking sites such as @entity149			1
@entity150 wrote : ‘ no lessons learned from the @entity153 event which was on the same gutteral level ... ‘ these idiot men are so grossly arrogant , have no sense of respect for others , let alone the people whom they have so sickeningly vilified			0
’ @entity160 wrote : ‘ i usually like that quiz but this year we turned over because i was sickened by them being so rude about the @entity4 and the really bad language			0
’ halfway through the broadcast @entity17 could be seen pulling a bottle of red wine from under his desk and pouring himself and @entity16 a drink while eating pizza			2
@entity11 later joked that the pair had drunk a bottle of wine each			0
after making a disgusting joke about @entity36 , @entity17 appears to realise he has gone too far saying : ‘ this is where i do myself in and forget we ’re recording this and it ’s going to be broadcast on tv			2
‘ i just think we are having a great time eating pizza			0
’ @entity183 tweeted : ‘ @entity23 , basically a reminder of what a sorry state @entity40 has become , and what a disgraceful year 2012 has been			2
' targets : the comics made crude jokes about gold medal sprinter @entity35 , left , and singer @entity36 , right bad taste : comedian @entity16 made rude comments targeted at the @entity4 , left , and the recent illness of her husband @entity33 , right one comedian who wo n't join in with the pack of ' competitive ' comedians vying to deliver the best line is @entity199			2
the impressionist slammed the @entity128 panelist show @entity201 , which satirises news and current affairs , for being ' highly competitive and quite aggressive '			0
mr @entity199 , who has starred in the award - winning @entity206 sketch show , appeared as a panelist on the programme for two series following its 2005 launch			2
he compared some comedians , who regularly deliver controversial remarks , to ' prize fighters ' , the @entity212 reported			2
the comedian refused to participate in the show , hosted by @entity218 , and said that he had learned other comedians found the atmosphere too abrasive			2
in 2009 @entity221 joined the chorus of discontent about the show , saying she left because of a lack of female panelists and the hostile nature of the show			0
she said at the time that she and other male comedians found that they had to ' bite someone 's foot off before they let us say something ' on the show			0
