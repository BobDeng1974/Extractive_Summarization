by @entity0 published : 11:42 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 11:42 est , 5 june 2013 @entity2 scientists claim to have found a crystal clear lake that has been untouched by climate change for over 7,500 years			1
‘ it 's like @entity10 's bathtub , ’ dr @entity5 said about the area named @entity7			2
’ the lake , which is one of the largest on @entity15 off the south @entity17 coast , is so pure that you can see to 10 metres below the surface to its bottom			1
@entity7 , which is one of the largest on @entity15 off the south @entity17 coast , is so pure that you can see to 10 metres below the surface to its bottom			1
scientists say it has been untouched by climate change for over 7,500 years researchers studied the lake 's water discharge , water quality and comparisons of historical photos over the past 117 years , as well as fossil pollen and algae to better understand its history			1
the discovery was made as researchers were studying former lakes in the same area that have dried up over the past 40 years			0
' we did n't realise just how unique and unusual this lake is until we started looking at a wide range of environmental markers , ' said @entity5			0
' we know that there have been variations in climate in the region including @entity15 over recent decades , but during that time the depth , shoreline and water chemistry of @entity7 has displayed little variation			1
' we also know that the region experienced a significant shift towards a drier climate around 4,000 years ago			0
again , @entity7 has demonstrated little variation over this period			2
this is in stark contrast to other changes in the region due to shifts in climate			0
@entity7 is in @entity15 , 18 miles off the coast of @entity61			1
its lakes are classed as one of the world 's most ecologically important wetlands according to @entity5 , @entity7 has remained unchanged because its waters drain into a nearby swamp and are replaced by an aquifer			1
‘ it appears that @entity7 has been an important climate " refuge " for the freshwater biota of the region , and is in the same condition now as it was 7500 years ago			1
' with appropriate management , the lake could continue relatively unchanged for hundreds , possibly thousands of years to come , ’ added @entity5			0
project leader dr @entity76 , said the results of this research could affect decision making about utilising the freshwater aquifer of @entity15 as a source of fresh water for the mainland			1
the results have been published online in the journal @entity86			0
@entity15 lies 18 miles off the coast of @entity61 - and its lakes are classed as one of the world ’s most ecologically important wetlands			2
as well as @entity7 , the waterways include @entity92 , the @entity93 , @entity94 and some small lagoons			2
the @entity97 name for @entity7 is ' @entity98 ' , which means ' silent pool '			0
a haven for wildlife , the area attracts forest birds , goannas ( a type of monitor lizard ) and other reptiles			0
@entity7 is also home to soft - spined sunfish			0
the lake is not accessible by car , and the nearest car park is 1.5 miles away .			0

@entity7 is in @entity15 off the south @entity17 coast
@entity7 is more than 10 meters deep and so pure you can see the bottom
the depth , shoreline and water chemistry of the crystal clear @entity7 have remained *constant* for over 7,500 years
