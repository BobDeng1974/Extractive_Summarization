by @entity0 for the @entity1 updated : 02:20 est , 29 july 2011 the guest list of old boys who gathered earlier this month for the bicentenary of the @entity6 read like a @entity7 of some of the most illustrious and wealthy members of @entity11 society			1
mingling in a marquee on the lawn known as @entity15 , they shared anecdotes about their membership of the school 's most prestigious club , known as ' pop ' , a self - electing group of the most popular and sporty sixth - formers			1
@entity23 , mayor of @entity24 , was there , along with @entity25 and @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , racehorse trainer @entity29 and sir @entity30 - great - grandson of the prime minister whose name he bears			2
then : @entity33 ( left ) was more popular and sporty than the @entity31 ( right ) now : sibling rivalry pushed @entity35 to become prime minister so , too , was @entity37 , older brother of our current prime minister - whose absence from this select group was the cause of much amusement among those present			1
for it was not that @entity35 was unavailable that night			0
he was n't even eligible			0
while his older brother had been a member of @entity46 at school , @entity35 never made the grade			1
which is why , at the end of a £ 250 - a - head dinner , @entity23 joked that those who were n't elected to @entity46 were sometimes so damaged by their feelings of rejection they acquired a burning ambition to become prime minister to make up for the humiliation			2
it was a gentle quip , but one which might well have hit a raw nerve with the pm had he heard it			0
in an interview this week , he opened up about the sibling rivalry which dogged his childhood , describing @entity33 , at 47 three years his senior , as a ' huge success ' on the sports field and ' almost always lead actor ' in school plays			1
his comments came in the latest issue of the @entity76 magazine , which the prime minister guest edited			0
he spoke about his childhood for one of the magazine 's columns : ' letter to my younger self			2
' ' i lived in the shadow of my older brother , ' mr @entity33 admitted			1
' he was three years older , went to the same school and was a huge success			1
it was great to have that kind of role model and i was incredibly proud of him , but like many younger brothers you find yourself always a few steps behind			0
' so who is the brother who once cast such a shadow on the pm ? he is @entity33 , a man who , as one of @entity11 's top barristers , has worked on some of the most high - profile legal cases of recent years			1
he successfully fought the extradition of @entity105 , defended @entity27 and @entity106 in their perjury trials , and recently defended @entity110 cricketer @entity109 against allegations of match - fixing			2
@entity23 : the mayor joked that @entity33 was spurred on to become @entity31 after being rejected from the popular group said to earn more than £ 1 million a year , @entity33 was just 39 when he took silk as a @entity116 and is described by law guide @entity118 @entity11 as a ' phenomenon ' with ' enthralling advocacy skills ' and a ' delightful bedside manner '			1
married to fellow barrister @entity122 , cousin of chef @entity123 , he has two children , @entity125 , 19 , and 17 - year - old old @entity126			2
@entity33 is clearly as driven towards success as his brother			1
the family resemblance is also unmistakable , although @entity33 is silver - haired and a little fuller - figured			1
their competitive streak stems back to their childhood in a former rectory near @entity136 , @entity137			0
@entity33 is the eldest of the four children born to wealthy stockbroker @entity139 and his wife , @entity141			1
a daughter , @entity142 , followed			0
@entity35 was the third - born , his sister @entity143 is the youngest			0
@entity35 followed his brother to @entity145 pre-preparatory school near @entity136			0
his biographers , @entity147 and @entity148 , in @entity33 , @entity149 , say it was during these years that the seeds of sibling rivalry were sown over fiercely competitive games of tennis and cricket			1
for the latter sport they organised annual matches between teams captained by each of the brothers			0
in 1974 , aged seven , @entity35 was sent to board at @entity162 prep school near @entity163 in @entity137 , a feeder school for @entity6 , following in the footsteps of his older , often more successful , brother			1
a few months later , both brothers appeared in a school production of @entity168 watched by , among other parents , the @entity170 and prince @entity171 , who were there to see 11 - year - old @entity173 performing as @entity174			0
@entity33 , one of @entity173 's closest friends at school and already marked out for his fine acting and public speaking skills , had the coveted role of @entity180			1
@entity35 , was given a smaller part , listed in the programme as ' @entity183 '			0
high - powered : the brothers at their day jobs both brothers played for the school 's cricket @entity189 , although contemporary accounts recall it was @entity33 who shone as a sportsman			1
but it was at @entity6 , where @entity35 arrived in 1979 , that he really felt the burden of a successful and talented older brother			1
a contemporary says : ' @entity33 was always the one mothers would want their daughters to marry			1
he was effortlessly charming and debonaire - very much the natural head boy type			0
' if you 'd had to vote then for which of the two brothers you thought might become prime minister , it would have been @entity33 every time			1
' not least because @entity33 was also an instant academic success , while @entity35 , a late developer , traipsed behind somewhat			1
however it was @entity33 junior 's failure to get into pop that must have really hurt			1
those chosen are entitled to wear a special uniform : a black tail coat with braid piping , spongebag trousers in a houndstooth check , a starched wing collar with a white bow tie and a waistcoat made from any fabric they desired			0
according to @entity222 , who was the year below @entity33 and two years above @entity35 at the £ 30,000 - a - year school : ' not getting into pop was one hell of a big deal			1
it would have been a complete slap in the face for @entity35 and probably goes in part to explain his ambitions as a politician			0
' @entity222 , author of the spoof novel @entity35 's @entity234 , points out that the high - octane atmosphere at @entity6 would have placed the brothers in direct competition			1
' even without an older brother who is doing well , it would have been highly competitive , ' says @entity222			1
' the school was full of alpha males			0
@entity35 and @entity33 were in the same house			2
and younger brothers are always left in the shadow of older brothers			2
@entity35 may well have left school feeling he had an awful lot still to prove			0
' school days : it was at @entity6 that @entity250 really felt the pressure of having a successful older brother immediately after school , @entity33 followed in @entity33 's footsteps again , heading to @entity255 for three months to work for the @entity257 shipping agency			1
by now , @entity33 was studying law at @entity259			2
and here , at last , @entity35 got one up on him - winning a place at @entity261 to read politics , philosophy and economics			0
thanks , in part , to their late father 's work ethic and high standards , both were determined to succeed in their chosen fields			2
as @entity35 told the @entity76 : ' if i could give my younger self some advice , i 'd say : " do n't worry about it			0
your life is not pre-determined			0
you 'll find your own feet in your own way			0
" it was not until i left school that i felt i was breaking out of my brother 's shadow			1
' as @entity35 found his feet on his long climb up the political ladder , @entity33 moved into his childhood family home with his wife and children , while @entity139 and @entity290 moved into a smaller , adjacent house			2
@entity139 once said that his sons had ' completely separate roles '			0
certainly , sibling rivalry , or ' younger brother syndrome ' as @entity35 once put it , has never got in the way of family loyalties			0
the brothers have always been close			0
@entity33 encouraged @entity35 to enter the conservative leadership race , apparently saying : ' you 've got to go for it			2
' yet even when it came to reaching the peaks of their professions , @entity33 got there first			2
just weeks before @entity35 became prime minister , @entity33 was voted head of his chambers at three @entity311			2
' a man for the big occasion , ' is how his peers describe him			0
' hardworking and very solid in his approach ' ; ' universally loved '			0
characteristics that would have made him a fine prime minister , if he had chosen politics instead of the law			0
perhaps @entity35 should count himself lucky that so far @entity33 has confined his political interests to a more modest stage : he is chairman of his parish council			2
burning issues of late have included whether to replace towels with hand - dryers in the village pavilion and whether a bus stop would be an unsightly addition to the parish			0
with the weight of the nation 's woes upon him in his great office of @entity334 , @entity35 may no longer feel overshadowed by his big brother - but what 's the betting there are n't days when he still envies him ?			1
