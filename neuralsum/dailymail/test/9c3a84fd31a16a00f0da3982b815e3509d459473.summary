until a few days ago , the closest @entity0 could come to playing @entity1 was on a simulator at @entity3 , where he also gained his first experience of @entity6 before last month 's @entity7			1
and considering the 27 - year - old @entity8 finished joint 12th following a closing round of 68 on the @entity11 , perhaps it is not too fanciful to suggest @entity0 could become the first @entity12 debutant to slip on the green jacket since @entity14 in 1979			1
' i 've always said if you 're not going to go to an event and be fully prepared to try to win , there is no point going , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity0 is aiming to become the first debutant to win the masters since @entity14 in 1979 @entity0 insists he is preparing to emerge victorious in the first major of 2015 @entity14 won on his @entity1 debut in 1979 and @entity0 is looking to emulate his achievements ' you do n't pitch up to try to finish 15th , 30th or just try to make the cut ; you try to go and win regardless of the field or whatever			1
if you ca n't do that i do n't know what your own long - term goal is			0
i have my own idea of where i want to be and it 's not finishing mid-pack			0
' a certain @entity32 might have something to say about such lofty ambitions next week , but @entity0 is very well aware of what the world number one is capable of from their amateur days			1
the pair met in the first round of the @entity40 in 2007 and it was @entity0 who was five up after six holes before eventually sealing victory on the 17th			2
later that year they were on the same team in the @entity48 as @entity49 and @entity50 lost out at @entity51 to an @entity53 team featuring @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			0
' that was a long time ago now , both of our games have changed since then so hopefully we can be on the same team in @entity63 and i can beat him a few more times , ' @entity0 added			1
' i think i was the last person to beat him as an amateur before he turned pro. he 's a very difficult person to beat right now on a golf course			0
it 's pretty phenomenal golf he 's playing			0
' if you finish one place in front of @entity32 in most events you 're going to do all right			0
he 's going to be the man to beat around @entity1			0
if he does n't win it this year i 'm sure it 's only a matter of time before he does			2
' @entity0 swapped the simulator for the real thing before heading to @entity81 to play in the @entity82 and was understandably excited by the prospect			2
' gym time before typing magnolia lane into the sat nav ! ! ! boom ! ! ' was one post on @entity87 , followed afterwards by : ' well that first experience at @entity1 can only be described as awesome ! ! ' the two - time @entity90 winner added : ' the first one is always special			1
i remember the first @entity82 that i played and there is a different feel about majors			0
i think the @entity12 is going to feel more different still			2
' obviously the @entity82 is close to your heart as your home major but the masters always has that air of being just a little bit special			0
i 'm going to try and treat it as a normal week in terms of i 'm going there to try and compete with all the guys i have played against for the last six years , try not to make it too much of an ordeal but at the same time appreciate what you 've achieved to get there and actually enjoy it			1
' to that end @entity0 and his friends and family will be renting two houses in @entity1 for the week , while his wife @entity115 will be carrying his bag in the traditional par - three contest on wednesday			1
' my wife was born on the sunday that @entity119 won ( in 1988 ) so that could be an omen , ' @entity0 joked			0
before the fun of the par - three contest @entity0 will look to pick the brains of the likes of stablemate @entity126 in practice , the former world number one having finished in the top 10 in each of the last three years and second in 2010			1
@entity0 ( left ) would postpone @entity32 's career grand slam hopes if he produced a surprise win @entity0 is renting two houses in @entity1 with his wife and family for the week in @entity1 but he will also take plenty of confidence from his victory in the @entity138 in @entity139 last december , when he finished with rounds of 65 and 66 to overturn a five - shot deficit to another former world number one in @entity142			1
' the win there is more for your own inward confidence that regardless of where you are , you can draw on experiences where you were really under pressure and had to hit a certain golf shot and that week i stood up and did it almost every time , ' said @entity0 , who remains top of the race to @entity155 ahead of @entity32			1
' i played fantastic , especially on sunday			0
we played very aggressive like we did all week , did n't change the game plan and kept smashing it with driver off the tee to get shorter irons in and that made it difficult when we got in front for people to catch us			0

27 - year - old @entity0 will make his debut at @entity12 next week
@entity0 insists he is not competing to make up the numbers
@entity0 is a two - time winner on the @entity90
