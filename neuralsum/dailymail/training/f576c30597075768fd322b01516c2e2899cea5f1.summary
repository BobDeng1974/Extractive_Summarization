@entity10 , 66 , hopes to expand the @entity12 club in @entity13 , where @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 have showcased their polo talents			1
but the plans submitted by mr @entity10 - who played alongside @entity20 when they were in the @entity1 - has been met with almost 100 objections from local residents			1
the 66 - year - old former drummer wants to expand the @entity12 polo club in @entity13 ( pictured ) prince @entity14 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) pictured during the @entity27 polo day at @entity28 in 2003 @entity10 ( pictured top right ) with the @entity1 - @entity20 is seated in the middle and to his left , @entity32 the application includes plans for 14 new homes , a five star hotel and luxury spa attached to the club house they are concerned about the strain the extra traffic will have on the area and the impact it will have on the environment			1
mr @entity10 , who first made his name as a member of the @entity47 , hopes to construct the @entity49 's first all - weather polo and equestrian estate with stables for 78 horses			1
he also hopes to build 14 new homes for ' equestrian enthusiasts ' and a five - star 74 - bedroom hotel and luxury spa attached to the existing clubhouse			1
the former drummer and father - of - six has said the application will boost the local economy , provide it with an estimated 639 jobs and improve the facilities in the local area			1
equestrian bodies — including the @entity66 , the @entity67 , the @entity68 and the @entity69 — have welcomed the new development			0
mr @entity10 said : ' it 's great to receive such strong support from the polo and equestrian communities , who have recognised the exciting opportunity that the expanded facilities at @entity12 can provide to the @entity49			1
' we have also been overwhelmed by the support shown by the community in @entity81 , having received over 100 letters of support			2
' i want to save the future of @entity12 and protect the open , green space			2
' we want to make sure we keep polo and equestrian activity at @entity12 and create something that respects @entity81 as a rural , village environment whilst bringing something special to the area			1
' the planning application is intended to provide a facility that preserves the site as a rural equestrian venue and create something local people can be proud of			1
' @entity10 , who is a keen polo player , pictured riding prince @entity14 in aid of @entity99 in 2002 @entity10 ( pictured third right ) with fellow members of @entity102 in @entity103 in 1988 - he will reunite with the band on june 14 at the @entity106 benefit concert held at his polo club however the application has received almost 100 objections from the local community			1
campaign group @entity111 particularly oppose to the proposed 14 new homes describing it as the ' tip of the iceberg '			2
there are also fears it would lead to the area being swamped with development , of the threat it will pose to the environment and the extra traffic it will create			0
@entity124 say a polo tournament earlier this year attracted more than 1,600 cars , leading to huge jams and nearly 300 cars were abandoned due to heavy rain			0
@entity130 , who opposes the plans , said : ' it is disingenuous to suggest that this polo club can suddenly turn into a national centre of excellence with only a small handful of wealthy players wanting to live on site			1
' on the application @entity140 , from @entity81 , wrote : ' i feel it would put an excessive strain on the village and also hurt the beautiful surroundings we currently enjoy			0
' another , @entity146 wrote : ' the application is just a smoke - screen for a massive housing development			0
the land is clay and not suitable for polo ponies and is underwater for most of the winter			0
' but former resident @entity155 , who used the polo club as a wedding venue for her daughter , said : ' having seen their ideas for the site , and knowing that something has to change , this seems to be a wonderful opportunity for the local community			1
' it would be a great enhancement to the area to have a good hotel , spa and restaurant , which could bring more jobs and opportunity to the local population			0
' @entity174 and @entity10 have lived in the area for a good number of years			0
surely it is always favourable to have someone who has clearly enjoyed living in the @entity81 area to apply and get the planning they require			0
' on his @entity183 page , @entity10 outlines the reasons to support the expansion of his polo club prince @entity16 and prince @entity14 at @entity12 - the application has been supported by equestrian bodies the club is currently licensed for 10 major events a year , each with a maximum attendance of 5,000 people			1
mr @entity10 has told @entity194 the fourteen country houses will be ' discreetly integrated ' into mature woodland and built around a grazing area			0
a transport assessment submitted as part of the planning application estimates only one extra car a minute would travel through @entity81 village at peak times and horsebox traffic would be directed away from the village			0
mr @entity10 created a private polo field on the land after moving to @entity81 in the late 1980s			2
he quickly turned it into a proper club , hosting star - studded international matches , charity events and concerts			2
he said he and his wife , former model @entity214 , are proud to have a 20 - year record of commitment to @entity12 and to be part of the @entity81 community			2
he said : ' we want to create something that puts @entity194 even more firmly on the map			0
our aim is to get leading equestrians living on the site , people living on @entity12 who have an inherent interest in making sure that its current use is maintained for the long term			0
' the plans , submitted to the waverley borough council , have so far received 90 objections and 117 supporters			2
