it was a moment that shocked audiences across the globe - during the @entity4 images showed @entity6 striker @entity5 appearing to bite @entity8 defender @entity7 during a match between the two nations			1
and using new @entity13 15 game some fans have humorously recreated the infamous moment			2
in pictures posted to @entity17 fans have claimed the game is ‘ so realistic ’ for letting them relive the moment that saw the @entity21 striker banned from football for four months			2
@entity5 was infamously banned for four months during the @entity4 for seeming to bite @entity8 defender @entity7 , and fans have taken to @entity17 mocking the striker with images from the game ‘ @entity13 15 is so realistic ’ @ djruch10 writes beneath an image that sees @entity5 sinking his teeth into a player			1
‘ was playing the @entity36 earlier got to say its pretty damn realistic , ’ @ @entity37 said under a similar image			0
of course , the ability to bite plays is not actually a feature of the new game			0
rather , the gamers have used the game ’s replay mode to spot some odd player collision moments in the game			0
the glitches seem to show @entity5 ’s mouth sinking into players , and it does n’t help his case that in some his eyes are closed and teeth bared in an apparent biting action			0
despite being labelled ' so realistic ' the ability to bite other players it not really a new feature , but rather just a result of gamers positioning players in the game to make it look like another biting incident @entity5 signed for @entity21 from @entity66 after the @entity4 despite the incident			1
however he is still yet to make his debut as he continues to serve his ban for biting @entity7			0
and that is replicated in @entity13 15 , as fans picking up the game will be unable to use @entity5 in the game ’s career mode for the entirety of his ban			1
however playing one of the game 's other modes that has full squads available without suspensions - such as an exhibition one - on - one against another gamer - allows the hilarious images to be taken			1

@entity5 was infamously banned for four months during the @entity4 for seeming to bite @entity8 defender @entity7
fans have taken to @entity17 mocking the striker with images from the game
it is not really a new feature though , but rather just a result of gamers positioning players in the game to make it look like another biting incident
in the game 's career mode @entity5 is serving his real - life ban until *october*
however playing one of the game 's other modes that has full squads available without suspensions allows the images to be taken
