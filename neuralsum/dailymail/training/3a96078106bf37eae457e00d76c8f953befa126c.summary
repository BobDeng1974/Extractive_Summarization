@entity60 , prosecuting , told the court the footage captured over a five - day period showed mrs @entity14 was subjected to an array of ' utterly undignified ' treatment			1
mrs @entity14 had lived at the home for six years and mrs @entity54 had given up her job to help the care home staff look after her			0
tormented : the dementia sufferer closes her eyes in pain as she is pulled up by one of the carers from a chair @entity33 , right , and @entity34 , left , are captured drag - lifting @entity14 across her bedroom floor			1

mrs @entity14 often cried and asked her daughter not to go			2
to allay their suspicions mr @entity78 set up the spy camera in his mother - in - law 's bedroom and the damning footage showed : both @entity37 and @entity34 dragging mrs @entity14 from a chair to her bed , with the pensioner ' shrieking ' as they did it ; mrs @entity14 being called a ' horrible old lady ' , a ' silly old t * * * ' and a ' nasty old cow ' by @entity37 ; the same carer striking mrs @entity14 on the hand and shaking her before telling her to ' p * * * off '			1
mr @entity60 said the footage showed both carers manhandling mrs @entity14 ' in a totally unauthorised manner ' , using a banned method of lifting			0
a training instructor was shown the video and what she saw left her ' completely shocked ' and ' physically upset '			0
' in her opinion this was the worst case of ill treatment and neglect and abuse of trust that she has ever seen in her years in this profession , ' he added			1
mr @entity60 told the court mrs @entity14 's daughter ' is sickened and horrified by the treatment administered to her mother ' , adding : ' she ca n't stop thinking about it , she often bursts into tears			1

they have been placed on the @entity134 , stopping them from working with vulnerable adults again			0
@entity137 , for @entity37 , said his client ' recognises that her behaviour was disgraceful '			0
@entity140 , for @entity34 , said she also regretted her actions			2
judge @entity43 told them : ' this lady does n't seem to have caused you any problems at all , which makes this treatment seem somewhat gratuitous			2
you 've known perfectly well that what you were doing was simply wrong			0
' vulnerable : @entity14 ( pictured ) was subjected to neglect and ill - treatment at the hands of her carers captured : @entity37 stands over @entity14 menacingly as she looks in distress in her bedroom in the care home helpless : @entity33 can be seen administering drugs and slapping the back of the hand of @entity14 and calling her a silly old t * * * and telling her to p * * * off @entity40 residential home in @entity41 , where the catalogue of abuse took place daughter @entity54 and her husband @entity79 are pictured leaving court after the verdict			1
mrs @entity54 installed the camera to capture the abuse after she thought something was wrong after the case @entity78 said : ' it is difficult to describe the effect this abuse has had on @entity175			2
' this will never leave our memories			2
moreover , we feel as though we have let @entity175 down			0
' she said the decision to install a camera was a ' last resort ' and followed ' various incidents over a period of months that could not be explained ' by care home staff			0
mrs @entity54 added : ' no one knows how long this abuse and neglect had been going on for			0
we hope that other families can learn from @entity175 's ordeal and be aware of certain signs			0

please listen to them and act			0
