by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 31 may 2013 botanists are hailing as a success a project to save the loneliest plant in @entity5 from dying out after they mated it with a partner from 175 miles away			1
a rare single female wild asparagus plant was found leading a solitary existence on the @entity9 in @entity10 in 1997			1
the endangered wild asparagus is one of the few plants in the @entity5 that have separate sexes and require a male and female to cross-pollinate with each other to reproduce			1
future 's bright : @entity18 with a female wild asparagus which has now successfully mated after being discovered clinging to the windswept @entity10 coast in 2006 experts found a male variety in @entity23 which they carefully moved to @entity10 and then rubbed its pollen on the female 's stigmas			1
her fertilised flowers then grew , producing bright red berries which each contained six seeds			0
these were then recovered , sewn in pots and grown in greenhouses			0
after two years , some 60 plants were deemed to be strong enough to plant out in the wild where they have spent the last five years			2
in safe hands : botanists managed to mate this female wild asparagus , which reached the ripe old age of 70 before it was spotted clinging to the windswept @entity10 coast , with an equally lonely male found in @entity23 out of the original 60 plants , 51 are still thriving today and are now on the verge of flowering for the first time , meaning they can reproduce and sustain themselves			1
@entity49 : the painstaking project to save the loneliest plant in @entity5 from dying out was hailed a success after botanists mated it with a partner from 175 miles away wild asparagus is found in only 28 sites in the @entity5 and its habitat is being steadily reduced , which is why scientists have made the effort to help them			1
the plant is different from garden asparagus that is popular to eat because it grows flat along the ground and its smaller spears have a bitter taste			2
the 60 plants were planted in two groups of 30 ; one at @entity67 at the eastern end of @entity69 alongside the lone female and the other near to @entity72			2
@entity73 , an ecological surveyor at the @entity74 , said : ' we brought up a @entity77 boy to have a bit of fun with our @entity10 girl in 2006 and since then it has been a waiting game			2
' because their natural habitat is in an exposed , hostile environment like sea cliffs it has taken the seedlings a bit longer to grow and start to flower			0
' when they were last looked at 21 out of 30 were still there on the @entity72 site and they were very healthy			0
' we are optimistic that we will begin to see some flowering now			0
' to stand any chance of long term survival , a wild asparagus colony needs to contain plants of both sexes			0
' any colony reduced to a single plant is ultimately doomed to extinction			2
' we still do n't yet know which sex the new plants are and wo n't be able to tell until they flower			0
the males have a different size and shape of flower			0
' but we are confident of a mix of male and female plants and then nature will take it course and the population will be self - sustaining			1
' success : a fresh young wild asparagus found thriving near the lonely female plant on @entity72 , @entity10 , discovered in 1997 - thanks to the perseverance of botanists ' pollination programme as well as conserving a rare and endangered plant that is @entity122 , it is hoped the genes from the wild asparagus could be introduced to the garden variety to make them more draught tolerant			1
other colonies of wild asparagus in @entity5 exist in coastal areas of @entity130 and @entity23			1
they appear to benefit from the north @entity133 drift , the sea current that keeps the south west relatively warm			0
the wild asparagus breeding project has been coordinated by various bodies including the @entity18 , @entity138 .			0

solitary female *specimen* was discovered clinging to wind - lashed coastal cliff
experts hand pollinate rare solitary female plant from @entity10 with male found in @entity23
painstaking fertilisation *secures* futures of one of @entity5 's rares plant
