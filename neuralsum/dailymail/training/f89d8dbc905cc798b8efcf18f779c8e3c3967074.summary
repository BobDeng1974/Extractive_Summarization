by @entity0 published : 13:48 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 13:36 est , 5 november 2012 as @entity1 : @entity4 's release draws ever closer , @entity2 caught up with the game 's star , @entity5 - the long - standing voice of @entity8			1
is it the darkest hitman game yet ? @entity5 : ' you know what , i think they ’re all pretty dark			1
i have n’t seen the whole game , but yes , it ’s fair to say that the darkness of it , the element of suspense , fear , death and destruction is the worst ... or the best			1
' legend : agent 47 is one of the most recognisable characters in video games how has the character evolved since you have played him ? @entity5 : ' i think the history and the back story of his creation has been developed more and i think it has also evolved			1
' i do n’t even know to what extent the creators had worked it through from start to end or whether they ’d gone from one game to the next , but i definitely think this game has a much more personal human element to it			2
' i thought @entity44 really was pushing it with advancing that human element with his relationship with @entity48 , however this one takes it to the next level			1
' do you feel like @entity8 has any weaknesses and are these explored in @entity4 ? @entity5 : ' weaknesses , well maybe killing people ! you know , i do n’t know			1
' i ’d say his only weakness may be that he might sometimes get a bit curious as to how he goes about killing someone or where that level could lead him to			2
' but then a weakness in this game might be his evolving relationship with one of the characters			1
' looks that kill : absolution is the most graphically accomplished hitman yet agent 47 has a dry sense of humour			2
are there any elements of the character that are similar to you ? @entity5 : ' yeah , a lot , actually			0
i kill people for a living , i have to admit it ( @entity83 )			0
' no , the dry sense of humour right from the get go was there and sometimes i was allowed to put in a bit more , in terms of delivering a line with a bit more irony than originally intended			0
' sometimes it was done as an alternative			0
i would say , " listen , can i just give him a little bit more of an edge ? i think there ’s a little twinkle in his eye when he does this line "			0
' i think his dark sense of humour has actually evolved , too			0
' lastly , what is your favourite hitman game ? @entity5 : ' @entity110 , @entity111 – i love that			0
' follow @entity0 on @entity113 : @ @entity114 and on @entity115 : @entity116 .			0

actor says @entity4 is ' darkest one yet '
