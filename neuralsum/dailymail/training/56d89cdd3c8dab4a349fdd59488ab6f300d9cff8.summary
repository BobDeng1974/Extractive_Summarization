a dozen years after 3 - year - old @entity3 's death , her alleged killer has still not been brought to justice			1
the toddler died on october 15 , 2002 , just one day after being admitted to the hospital for vomiting and seizures			1
doctors reported her symptoms to the police , saying they were consistent water intoxication , and the finger of blame fell on babysitter @entity15 , now 45			1
twelve years later , @entity15 has still not been brought to trial and remains free on bond thanks to several delays in her case			1
too young : twelve years after the death of 3 - year - old @entity3 , her accused killer still has not been tried in court this has left @entity26 's mother @entity25 unable to heal from the incredibly traumatic experience of losing a child			2
' there is no justice			0
it 's been 12 years that i 've lived in frustration , ' @entity25 told the @entity34			0
in 2002 , @entity25 was a single mother renting a room in @entity15 's @entity36 , @entity37 home			1
when @entity15 offered to take care of little @entity3 while her mother worked clearing tables at a @entity42 restaurant , @entity25 accepted			2
killer ? babysitter @entity15 , now 45 ( pictured ) , is suspected of forcing @entity3 to drink nearly a gallon of water in just a four hour period after @entity3 's untimely death , the medical examiner ruled it a homicide , saying the girl had been forced to ingest nearly a gallon of water in the four hours before she was hospitalized			1
that caused her sodium levels to drop and her brain to swell , sending her into shock and shutting down her vital organs			0
during those four hours , @entity3 was in the care of @entity15 , though she says the little girl ingested the water herself , while taking a bath			2
because forced water intoxication is such an uncommon accusation , it took five months to bring up charges against @entity15 and she was eventually arrested in april 2003			1
she spent one month in jail before being freed on bond			0
then , from 2004 to 2007 the case was again delayed after @entity15 was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial in january 2010 the case hit another road bump when her defense attorney dropped out			2
however , defense attorney @entity73 , to this day believes in her former client 's innocence			0
' @entity15 is innocent , no doubt about that , ' @entity76 said			2
' she is completely innocent , she is a good woman â€¦ she ca n't hurt a fly			0
' due to a change in @entity37 law , @entity15 is now facing much less prison time if convicted			1
initially she was charged with first - degree murder , with aggravated child abuse as the underlying cause , which carries a maximum of life in prison sentence			1
but those charges have now been downgraded to aggravated manslaughter due to a tweak in the law which requires a pattern of abuse to prove aggravated child abuse			0
now she faces only a maximum of 30 years in prison			1
however , it appears the trial may soon take place since march 1 marks the cut - off date for any remaining depositions , expert testimony or evidence in the case			0
and that 's good news for @entity25 , who can finally see justice in the case of her daughter , who would be 15 today had she survived			0
' there is no way to describe this loss because there is nothing in the world that is more horrid than for a mother to lose a child , ' @entity25 says			0
now 43 , @entity25 has since married and is mother to her 11 - year - old twins and a 20 - year - old stepdaughter .			0
