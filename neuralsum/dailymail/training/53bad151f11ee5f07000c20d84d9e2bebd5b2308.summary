by @entity0 published : 20:54 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 20:54 est , 22 june 2012 that coffee you 're drinking while gazing at your @entity3 ? it cost more than all the electricity needed to run those games , emails , videos and news stories for a year			1
the annual cost to charge an @entity3 is just $ 1.36 , according to the @entity11 , a non-profit research and development group funded by electric utilities			1
by comparison , a 60 - watt compact fluorescent bulb costs $ 1.61 , a desktop pc adds up to $ 28.21 and a refrigerator runs you $ 65.72			1
power play : it takes only $ 1.36 of electricity to charge an @entity3 for a year , much less than other electronics the group , known as @entity11 , studied the power consumption of @entity24 's @entity3 to determine the effect that the newly - popular devices might have on the nation 's electricity use			1
the answer : not much			0
if the number of @entity3 triples from the current 67 million , they would need the electricity from one small power plant operating at full strength			2
but if people are using @entity3 instead of televisions to play video games , or ditching their desktop computers for @entity3 , the shift to tablets could mean lower overall power consumption			2
a desktop computer uses 20 times more power than an @entity3			0
@entity44 , the @entity11 researcher who conducted the @entity3 test , said the group is now studying usage to understand whether the explosion of tablets is adding to power consumption , or reducing it			1
heavy use : the cost would be slightly more for those who play video games on the @entity3 and use it incessantly residential power demand is on track to fall for the third straight year , according to the government			1
a weak economy is keeping people in smaller houses and shacked up with others			0
at the same time , efficiency programs are pushing more efficient light bulbs , air conditioners and other devices into homes			0
refrigerators use a quarter of the power they used a generation ago , according to @entity11			0
for the @entity3 test , @entity44 measured the amount of power used to charge up an @entity3 with a drained battery			2
he assumed that users would charge up every other day			0
over a year , the latest version of the @entity3 consumed 11.86 kilowatt - hours of electricity			2
( @entity81 versions consume somewhat less power			0
) the juice would cost $ 1.36 at the @entity85 average residential price of 11.49 cents per kilowatt - hour			1
but there 's an even cheaper way to go than the @entity3			0
@entity11 calculated the cost of power needed to fuel an @entity90 for year : just 38 cents .			1

@entity11 calculated the annual cost to charge @entity3 is $ 1.36
average cost of running refrigerator for year is $ 65.72
