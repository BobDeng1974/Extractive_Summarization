victims of @entity1 are threatening to sue the @entity2 for covering up his decades of sickening sexual abuse			1
as mps and child abuse charities call for a full inquiry into @entity1 ’s paedophile activities over more than 40 years , six victims said that they would issue writs for damages if it could be shown the @entity2 had known about @entity1 ’s abuse but failed to try to stop him			1
former children ’s minister @entity14 called for @entity1 to be posthumously stripped of his knighthood following devastating revelations about his depravity in a book by @entity20 mp @entity19 , being serialised by the @entity21			2
further explosive revelations from the book in today ’s @entity21 include : lawyers for @entity1 ’s victims are looking to pursue @entity35 as well as the @entity2			1
fiend : @entity1 's crimes were covered up by his high - ranking friends portrait of a child abuser : like his friend @entity41 , @entity1 used his charitable works as a cover for his fiendish activities			1
biographer @entity19 believes that the @entity45 is still in denial about the monster who was in their midst @entity50 , a solicitor at @entity51 representing six men who claim they were molested by the mp as boys , is investigating how much senior liberals knew			0
he said : ‘ we are examining who knew what about the mp , and that includes the @entity2 and @entity35 , and we are actively considering all possibilities in relation to those potential defendants			2
’ mr @entity19 , who interviewed many of @entity1 ’s victims for his book , said it was ‘ only right and proper ’ that they should seek compensation from ‘ those who neglected to listen to them ’			1
the @entity20 mp added : ‘ i think consideration should be given to some sort of inquiry in terms of what @entity1 was up to			2
there is still a lot of denial around – not least in the @entity45			0
‘ witnesses could be called to bring evidence , while others could face questions in terms of what they knew and what action they did – or did not – take about this prolific abuser			0
’ @entity14 , a @entity86 former children ’s minister , called for a wide - ranging inquiry into historic child abuse , looking at @entity1 ’s activities alongside those of @entity41 and paedophiles in the @entity92 , children ’s homes , churches and schools			1
@entity14 , mp ( left ) , a former children 's minister wants to see a wide - ranging investigation into the activities of @entity1 , similar to that carried out on his friend and fellow paedophile @entity41 ( right ) he said the @entity2 seemed to have ‘ turned a blind eye ’ to the allegations , and called for @entity1 to be stripped of his knighthood			1
‘ very clearly this chap did some nasty things and we need to get to the bottom of how exactly this went on and how it was that the @entity113 made him a knight			0
at present it is not possible to strip public figures of an honour after death because they cease to hold the gong when they die			0
the @entity2 need to put their hand up and say what happened then , ’ he said			0
@entity1 was knighted on the recommendation of former @entity2 leader @entity126 in 1998 , when rumours about the @entity20 politician 's sexual activities were already rife in @entity130			1
party allies : @entity1 was recommended for a knighthood by @entity126 , former @entity45 leader @entity126 became @entity2 leader in 1976 after @entity135 was forced to resign after he was accused of conspiracy to murder his former gay lover			1
@entity126 , at 38 , was one of the youngest party leaders in @entity140 political history and in march 1977 he formed the @entity142 pact to keep @entity145 's minority @entity20 administration in power			2
@entity147 , the @entity148 mp for @entity149 , added : ‘ a public inquiry would get to the truth			0
it ’s transparency and the truth which conquers all			0
‘ i ’m not convinced that organisations that have allowed this to happen on their watch have changed			0
’ man of the people ... if only the people knew : sir @entity1 was a popular figure nationally , one of the most recognisable political figures in @entity140 in the 1970s , often appearing on light entertainment shows like @entity164 and @entity165 discussing his friend @entity166 @entity167 , a whistleblower who exposed abuse by @entity1 and others at @entity171 residential school in @entity20 , said the local council had also carried out a massive cover - up			1
they failed to take action and instead hid the evidence in a safe at the council , ’ he said			0
@entity179 , the chief executive of the @entity180 in @entity181 , said there needed to be a wide - ranging @entity183 looking into cover - ups of historic child abuse			0
he said : ‘ there absolutely should be an inquiry [ into @entity1 ’s abuse ]			1
the reason i do n’t think there will be one is because there are too many others who have been involved with the outrages and are still alive and kicking , and would not want to be associated			0
’ @entity2 front bench : @entity1 ( right ) shares a joke with @entity45 leader @entity135			1
@entity135 was forced to resign as leader in 1976 after he was charged with conspiracy to murder his former gay lover			0
he was acquitted on june 22 , 1979 @entity201 , the @entity202 ’s director of national services , added : ‘ no matter what the situation , any complaints about child abuse should be investigated and people in positions of power should not be immune from this			2
’ one of @entity1 ’s victims called for the @entity2 to carry out a full inquiry			1
@entity214 , 65 , said : ‘ @entity215 needs to tackle this because a failure to act 40 years ago led to the abuse of dozens and dozens of boys by one of their leading mps			0
’ a @entity2 - @entity2 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ @entity1 ’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined			1
‘ his actions were not known to or condoned by anyone in the @entity45 or the @entity2			2
it would be inappropriate to comment further on any potential legal action			0
’ and @entity235 , the @entity2 mp for @entity236 , told the @entity237 : ‘ i am as shocked as the next person by these revelations			2
i can confirm that they were not widely known until recently			0
’ but there is growing evidence that senior figures in the party did hear rumours about the crimes			0
as far back as april 1979 , a press officer working for then @entity2 leader @entity126 , now @entity126 of @entity248 , gave a statement about @entity1 ’s alleged abuse to a local newspaper , the @entity252			1
after learning that the title intended to print details of a police investigation into complaints against @entity1 , @entity126 ’s spokesman said at the time : ‘ it ’s not a very friendly gesture , publishing that			1
all he seems to have done is spanked a few bare bottoms			0
’ one former @entity235 mp , @entity235 , who was in @entity263 from 1983 to 1987 , has said that ‘ whispers ’ that @entity1 ‘ liked boys ’ did the rounds of @entity130 over the ensuing years			2
@entity148 mp @entity147 ( left with wife @entity267 ) is calling for a public enquiry into @entity1 ; former @entity235 mp @entity235 ( right ) says that whispers that @entity1 liked little boys did the rounds at @entity130 for years @entity126 , who put @entity1 forward for his knighthood , has yet to comment on the @entity21 ’s recent revelations and it remains unclear what steps he took to confirm that the obese politician was telling the truth			2
@entity280 officers would watch as @entity1 cruised known pick - up spots looking for young rent boys during @entity45 conferences in @entity284 , it was claimed yesterday			1
police were also allegedly aware that he secretly took vulnerable schoolboys on holiday with him and his mother to @entity289 in @entity290 so he could abuse them			0
sir @entity1 ’s family said yesterday that they were ‘ saddened and concerned ’ by the claims about him			1
in a statement to the @entity297 , @entity1 ’s 82 - year - old brother @entity294 and other relatives said they were upset that the allegations were being made when he is no longer alive to defend himself			1
