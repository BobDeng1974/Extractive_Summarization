by @entity0 published : 06:30 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 04:01 est , 23 november 2012 pay deal : @entity2 left the @entity3 with £ 670,000 soon after she lost out on the director general 's job to @entity6 losing a well - paid job at the @entity3 is like ‘ winning the lottery ’ because of the huge pay - off that inevitably follows , mps said yesterday			1
they accused the corporation of ‘ hosing down ’ departing executives with licence payers ’ money as details of the extraordinary exit packages for former top executive @entity2 and director general @entity6 were made public			1
they were left ‘ incredulous ’ when learning that former chief operating officer miss @entity2 left with a £ 670,000 pay - off – more than twice her £ 330,000 salary – even though she had wanted to quit			1
senior labour mp @entity21 suggested that the entire leaving package in september was essentially manufactured to ‘ compensate ’ miss @entity2 after losing out to mr @entity6 in the race for the director generalship			1
miss @entity21 , chairman of the influential @entity26 , said : ‘ she did n’t get the top job and she wanted to leave , so someone created a redundancy where there was n’t one			0
' a lot of people do n’t get the jobs they want to			0
’ in addition , mr @entity6 ’s lavish deal – which approaches £ 500,000 and was agreed ‘ for the good of the licence - fee payer ’ – has brought to £ 4million the sums paid out to ten departing @entity3 executives in the past two years			1
@entity42 mp @entity41 said : ‘ it does look as though losing a job at the @entity3 is the same as winning the lottery			0
’ the row took the gloss off the unveiling of @entity51 boss @entity50 as the corporation ’s new director general yesterday			1
demands : @entity6 gave the @entity3 a list of demands worth at least £ 500,000 if they wanted him to quit , mps were told @entity59 's take on today 's events some observers even wondered whether the timing of the announcement about @entity50 was an attempt to divert attention from the embarrassing commons scenes			1
mr @entity6 quit earlier this month after only 54 days in charge			2
but on top of his well - publicised £ 450,000 pay - off – double that to which he was entitled – his lavish exit package included another £ 45,000 for bills for lawyers and communications advisers			1
the deal included up to £ 10,000 for the legal advice to help him secure his pay - off			0
he also received a year ’s @entity79 private medical cover , legal expenses of up to £ 25,000 to help him give evidence to two inquiries into the @entity84 affair , and £ 10,000 for public relations assistance to cope with the ‘ considerable amount of door - stepping ’ from reporters			0
yesterday @entity3 trustee @entity89 was repeatedly criticised when he appeared in front of the @entity26			1
one mp said the @entity93 saga revealed the @entity3 ’s ‘ complete lack of understanding ’ for the ‘ punter ’ who pays for the licence fee			2
mr @entity89 expressed his own ‘ irritation and aggravation ’ at the terms of the pay - out , admitting that members of the public would regard the amount as ‘ in the stratosphere ’			0
anger : @entity3 trustee @entity89 ( left ) said he was irritated by @entity93 's demands but it was the right decision while select committee chairwoman @entity21 ( right ) said it showed how far the @entity3 is out of touch but he revealed that mr @entity6 had made it clear through his lawyers that the £ 450,000 deal for his resignation was the ‘ only thing that was on the table ’			1
mr @entity89 said that had the director general been fired it would have been likely to cost the corporation a further £ 80,000 if it had gone to an employment tribunal			1
one year 's salary - £ 450,000 @entity79 policy - £ 1,200 per year legal fees for setting up deal - up to £ 10,000 legal fees for 2 @entity130 inquiries - £ 25,000 ' communications budget ' - £ 10,000 pension pot - £ 883,000 or £ 40,000 per year the pay - off , along with the details of miss @entity2 ’s exit deal , left mps on the committee angry			1
miss @entity2 , who left after 37 years , is understood to have received a year ’s pay for being made redundant and a further year ’s pay for payment of her notice period			0
@entity26 chairman @entity142 suggested the redundancy had been a ‘ device to pay off her disappointment ’			0
she added : ‘ she did n’t get the job and then she goes			0
' she might be really , really fed up and felt she did not want to work for the organisation any more ... you ca n’t then give them £ 670,000 of licence fee payers ’ money			0
’ her colleague on the committee , @entity42 mp @entity153 , said : ‘ you do n’t hose them down with money as compensation			0
that is what this looks like			0
’ announcement : @entity6 with @entity167 chairman @entity166 , as he announces his resignation - 15 minutes after the @entity167 agreed the deal @entity2 was the @entity3 ’s top woman executive and favourite to be the first female director general but was pipped by rival @entity6			1
she earned £ 330,000 as chief operating officer but left in september after her post was axed			1
on top of her £ 670,000 pay - off she left with a £ 1.71million pension pot. the 58 - year - old first joined the @entity3 after starting as a trainee journalist in 1975			2
since the @entity3 began publishing the expenses of its top executives , her taxi claims received attention with her regular use of cabs costing thousands of pounds of licence fee money each year			0
ms @entity2 is married to the former @entity187 advisor @entity186 – her second husband – and has one son of mr @entity6 ’s deal , miss @entity21 said : ‘ we express incredulity			0
it demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of how this is viewed in the public domain , given that it is licence fee - payers ’ money			0
that is the real shocker about this			0
‘ he took a public job , he was hugely well remunerated , he failed in 54 days , he gets incredibly rewarded for failure ... there is no understanding of what the ordinary punter turning on the telly feels about it			0
’ there were gasps from committee members when it emerged that 574 @entity3 bosses received private healthcare as part of their deals , worth in the region of £ 2million in total			1
miss @entity21 later told @entity220 ’s @entity221 she was concerned by a series of severance packages for top @entity3 managers , including deputy director general @entity225 , who received almost £ 1million , and former marketing director @entity226 , who got nearly £ 400,000			1
she said : ‘ this is taxpayers ’ money			0
you really have to think very , very carefully when you are spending that money that it is in the public interest			0
’ mr @entity89 offered a faint hope that some of mr @entity6 ’s pay - out could be recouped , depending what came out of the inquiry into the decision to drop the original @entity130 inquiry into @entity84 last year			2
the @entity3 is being urged to allow spending watchdog the @entity239 to look at the terms of mr @entity6 ’s departure , but the corporation is resisting the move			2
in the last two years alone , leaving @entity3 executives have taken more than £ 8.5m of license - fee payer money in payouts and pensions a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ between august 2009 and august 2012 the @entity3 has reduced its senior management numbers by 29 per cent and its senior management pay bill by 30 per cent			1
‘ part of this restructuring requires us to pay redundancy packages for senior management who in some cases have worked at the @entity3 for many years			2
' in all cases by closing the posts the redundancy payments will have paid for themselves in under two years			0
