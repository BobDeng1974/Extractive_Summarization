@entity1 head coach @entity0 will not panic if there are no major additions to his squad during the january transfer window			1
the @entity6 arrived at @entity7 in the summer following a successful stint as @entity10 boss - with six new players also joining @entity1 as @entity0 , as well as chairman @entity12 and technical director @entity13 , acquired the talent they felt could help them return to the @entity15			1
after a shaky start to the campaign , @entity0 now has his side playing some good football and , with a @entity20 semi-final against @entity22 and a @entity24 tie against @entity25 on the horizon , @entity1 sit just four points outside the @entity28 's top four			2
@entity0 says he is happy with his squad , after @entity1 have shown improvement in recent weeks @entity31 international @entity30 will link up with the squad in the new year after a deal was originally struck with his current club @entity34 in august			1
but the 21 - year - old is likely to be one for the future and , although @entity0 has been linked with a string of central defenders , he insists he would be happy if he is left with his current crop come february 1			2
@entity31 defender @entity30 , 21 , will join up with @entity1 in january , after agreeing a deal in august ' we have a lot of chats and have i told him all my thoughts , ' @entity0 said of transfer window discussions with @entity12			1
' we have common sense , when the window opens in january we will start to decide but so far we are very happy with our squad			0
' i am happy , it 's not about if you sign or not			0
i 'm happy here and i 'm happy with our squad			0
i never put pressure ( on the chairman )			0
@entity0 brought in six signings over the summer , including @entity56 and @entity57 ' we need to understand in football , when you are a head coach you need to try to explain to the chairman , sporting director , my thoughts and advice and then decide the best for the team			2
' @entity0 's squad will certainly come under scrutiny in the days leading up to the opening of the transfer window with home games against @entity72 and @entity73 following a boxing day trip to bottom side @entity75			1
but , with the potential of a fully - fit squad , it will be a good chance for the coach to show what strength he already has at his disposal - or indeed show the weaknesses that need improving with a dip into the transfer market			0
@entity88 's excellent strike against @entity89 has put @entity1 within touching distance of the top four			0

@entity1 brought in six signings , and a new manager , last summer
@entity30 will join in january from @entity34
but @entity0 says he does not need any more new players
