support : prince @entity1 is patron of the wildlife charity @entity2 prince @entity1 was last night urged to cancel his visit to a wildlife park in @entity6 where elephants are forced to dance , play football and perform degrading circus tricks for crowds of tourists			1
the prince , a keen conservationist , is due to round off a solo trip to @entity14 and @entity6 next month with a visit to @entity16 in @entity17			1
the popular tourist attraction set in a nature reserve is home to some of @entity6 ’s last remaining wild elephants			1
@entity1 , who is patron of the @entity2 wildlife charity , will also see the reserve ’s @entity25 , which has been credited with helping to double the wild elephant population in @entity6 ’s @entity28 in the past two decades			1
what the @entity12 may not realise , however , is that just 400 yards away , captive elephants are forced to perform to thousands of visitors a day in a shoddy arena that draws crowds from across @entity6			1
chained by their legs in dingy pens between performances , the wretched - looking elephants go wearily through a routine that involves kicking footballs into a goal , dancing to disco music and forming a pyramid , four times a day			2
in depressing scenes witnessed by @entity46 on friday , one elephant is spun around on a wheel to music while another is made to put on a pair of glasses , before picking a ‘ girlfriend ’ from the audience and kissing her with its trunk			0
when the shows are over , the weary elephants – led by handlers carrying bullhooks – take tourists on rides around the arena for £ 8 a circuit or pick up tourists by their trunks for a few seconds for £ 4			2
most of the performing elephants , which experts say are subjected to brutal ‘ breaking ’ rituals to tame them , have had their tusks sawn off			0
one handler explained : ‘ we do it to make it safer for people			0
it also stops the elephants injuring the performers or each other			0
’ barbaric : elephants are forced to perform degrading tricks in an arena that draws crowds from across @entity6 in the breaking rituals , according to animal welfare groups , young elephants are separated from their mothers , and then beaten and deprived of food and water for up to a week to make them subservient to trainers			1
the shows – @entity16 ’s biggest draw – are highly lucrative , with up to 15,000 tourists a day paying £ 6.50 each			1
word about prince @entity1 ’s visit has spread rapidly among excited park employees			1
@entity97 , 36 , who works as a compere at the elephant shows , said : ‘ he is very handsome			0
i do n’t know if he will come to see our show but i hope that i get the chance to meet him			0
’ wretched : the animals are chained in pens and have their tusks cut off in its brochure , the park – which is operated by a tourism company set up by the local government – says the animals used in performances are rescued wild elephants , which have been injured or abandoned in the reserve			1
the news will alarm animal welfare groups , which believe rescued animals should be released back into the wild			0
@entity1 is due to meet one of four elephants rescued from poachers during his visit on march 4			1
yesterday , in the park ’s rescue centre , we found a distressed young elephant left alone in a concrete enclosure			2
wardens told us it had been rescued after being orphaned in the wild , but refused to say if it was the one @entity1 would see , or if it would be trained for the shows			2
the park declined to answer questions about the @entity12 ’s visit			2
@entity136 , of the @entity137 and @entity138 charity , said : ‘ i applaud @entity1 for visiting @entity6 to address wildlife conservation issues , but do not feel he should be endorsing circus performances involving abused elephants			1
any elephant forced to perform is subjected to immeasurable cruelty to do the unnatural tricks it has been trained to do			2
these barbaric performances should be brought to an end			0
’ elephant shows are banned or restricted in 30 countries including @entity151 and the @entity152 , which has also introduced total bans on animal performances			0
the @entity155 is trying to ban them in @entity157 but legislation has so far been blocked			0
the number of wild elephants in @entity28 province has reportedly doubled to about 300 in the past few years thanks to the reserve , government - financed feeding programmes and laws which threaten poachers with the death penalty			1
excited : @entity97 , 36 , who works as a compere at the elephant shows , is hoping the @entity12 pays a visit a @entity172 source said last night : ‘ the @entity174 ’s visit is to learn about emerging indigenous @entity6 approaches to conservation			1
his time at @entity16 is not to judge or condone , but to gain a greater understanding of the challenges in a part of the world where developments in conservation are critical to the elephants ’ survival			2
’ there was yet more embarrassment for @entity1 last night after it emerged that @entity188 and @entity189 – both accused of encouraging tax avoidance – are sponsoring an event he is due to attend on his visit to @entity6			1
the prince is set to appear at next month ’s @entity195 , which is designed to showcase @entity157 creativity and business			0
more than 500 @entity157 companies will use the @entity200 festival , which has been co-ordinated by @entity201 , to reach a global business audience			0
scandal - hit @entity188 , which is facing an investigation over allegedly helping customers dodge tax , and consultants @entity189 , which the @entity207 said promoted tax avoidance on an ‘ industrial scale ’ , are sponsoring the event			0
@entity211 , of @entity212 , said : ‘ prince @entity1 is in a predicament , or people are putting him in one			2
‘ why is he being asked to compromise himself in this way ? this conference shows that companies which have worked to undermine the taxation revenue of this country are part of the establishment in this country			0
the two are inextricably linked			0
