by @entity0 @entity2 advisers in @entity4 risk assassination by troops they are trying to train , according to a classified report			1
@entity2 who are assigned to advise @entity9 ’s forces could be at risk because so many units are deeply infiltrated by either @entity13 extremist informants or @entity15 personnel backed by @entity16 , the report by @entity2 detailed			1
if the @entity2 does decide to assist in moving back the the advances made by @entity13 militants in northern and western @entity4 over the past month , the assessment concludes that only about half of @entity4 ’s operational units are able to carry out the push			1
@entity15 volunteers , who have joined the @entity4 army to fight against militants			1
@entity2 advisers in @entity4 risk assassination by troops they are trying to train , according to a classified report the report says @entity4 troops are dependent on @entity15 militias - @entity2 troops battled agasint @entity15 militia after it invaded @entity4 and this could also be a danger , reports the @entity36			1
last month the @entity2 and @entity4 on reached a key agreement on legal protections that will enable up to 300 special operations forces to deploy in the country			1
' they will be very good at improving the immediate tactical proficiency of some of the @entity4 military , but they will be less prepared to address the long - term health of the @entity4 army , ' said retired lt. gen. @entity47 , who was in charge of training @entity4 forces in 2007 and 2008			0
with the army 's northern divisions hard hit by desertions as key @entity13 cities fell in june , prime minister @entity52 's @entity15 - led government has leaned heavily on @entity15 militias and volunteers motivated by a sense of religious duty in essence , he said , the @entity2 teams will be ' sharpening the tip of the spear , but not replacing the rotted staff with a new one			1
' in a string of battlefield victories , the @entity13 militants have captured several key towns in the north and on the border with @entity73 , sending @entity4 troops fleeing			2
abandoned by military leaders who may have felt alienated by the @entity15 - led government , troops ran , leaving their weapons and equipment			2
' it 's a rapidly deteriorating situation , ' said @entity80 , a senior associate at the @entity81 / ' it 's a hot war			0
they have to get in and help stop the bleeding to get the @entity4 forces to be able to maintain stability and security in the country			2
gen. @entity90 , head of @entity91 , said @entity92 currently are conducting training missions in 30 countries and do so in more than 150 nations each year			0
highly trained in special warfare and counterinsurgency , the teams routinely are used to help other countries build and improve their militaries			0
rebel fighters from the @entity102 , @entity73 's largest rebel coalition , hold a position during clashes with militants of the @entity106 ( is ) , formerly known as the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) , for the control a village on the outskirts of @entity111 the latest @entity4 mission , @entity90 said , is more akin to what special forces have been doing in @entity115 and the @entity116 and what they did in @entity4 during the war years			2
but it 's a bit larger than similar missions going on around the world , including a number of countries in @entity125			0
@entity90 , who served in @entity4 , said the assessment phase will be important in determining how to go forward but , ' having some experience with that , i think that we will rather quickly understand where we need to apply our assistance			0
' the teams will determine how the @entity2 can best help the @entity4 forces , then the additional teams will deploy			1
they are expected to help the @entity4 improve their military systems and commands , but not embed with the fighting units or engage in direct combat			0
@entity4 stand over the debris of a house after an air raid by @entity4 air forces in @entity146 city @entity90 also noted that a number of @entity2 special forces have served in @entity4			1
' the relationships that we have with the @entity4 , at least those that i had while i was there , were very strong , and i 'm sure that we 'll be able to capitalize on this as we go back in , ' @entity90 said			0
still , @entity47 said that while the commandos will provide important short - term help for the @entity4 forces , they will not be sufficient to solve the problem			0
instead , he said prime minister @entity52 needs to make several critical political moves , including disbanding the office of the commander in chief , which has been blamed for roiling sectarian divisions and pushing a @entity15 agenda			2
@entity2 officials are also pressing for a government transition that will better empower the minorities and bring the country together , thus conceivably avoiding a civil war			1
the legal agreement was needed to get the special forces into @entity4			2
@entity4 @entity15 fighters with the ' @entity173 ' patrol during a sand storm on the outskirts of @entity176 @entity4 @entity15 fighters patrol on the outskirts of @entity176 , 60 miles ( 95 kilometers ) north of @entity9 , @entity4			0

instead , if there are any problems , troops would be subject to the @entity2 @entity203			0
the legal protections are similar to those provided to @entity2 diplomats and troops working out of the embassy , officials said , @entity211 spokesman @entity210 drew a distinction between the current situation and the administration 's desire to have the @entity4 parliament approve immunity for @entity2 troops when the @entity2 was looking to leave a residual force behind in 2011			1
@entity4 refused to sign that agreement and the @entity2 pulled all but a small number of forces out of the country in december 2011			1
fewer than 200 troops , largely providing security , have remained at the @entity2 @entity227 as part of the @entity229			0
' we 're dealing with an emergency situation — that 's the first part — and there is an urgent need for these advisers to be able to do their work on the ground in @entity4 , ' @entity210 said , adding that they are going in at the request of the @entity4 government			0
officials also noted that the force being sent in now is much smaller than the several thousand that the military planned to leave there after 2011 .			0
