after loaning @entity2 £ 2million this week , @entity1 owner @entity0 has increased his control over the crisis - hit club			1
but how far does that control extend ? what practical effects will it have ? and are fans right to be worried ? @entity11 's @entity10 answers the key questions on @entity0 's latest power grab			2
does @entity0 now own @entity2 outright ? in a word – no. however , to all intents and purposes , he is now the powerbase at the club			1
@entity2 will now take whichever direction he decides			0
but is n’t his shareholding still fairly minimal ? yes			0
he only owns 8.92 per cent of the club but it ’s the terms of the £ 2m loan he agreed to give @entity2 last week that cements his position			1
it ’s believed @entity0 will have two placemen on the board and he is already allies with @entity30 , chairman @entity31 and @entity32			1
so he ’ll be calling all the shots			0
@entity1 owner @entity0 's ( left ) loan being accepted has led to @entity37 's resignation @entity0 's £ 2million offer will see @entity2 into the @entity39 and there could be future funding to follow that and who are his men on the board likely to be ? former @entity1 chief executive @entity45 is already in @entity46 and seems certain to fill the chair vacated by outgoing @entity48 this week			1
another @entity0 man , @entity49 , is likely to fill the void left by finance chief @entity51			1
the removals of both @entity37 and @entity51 were a condition of the @entity0 loan			1
as the owner of @entity1 too , is n’t there a conflict of interest there ? you would have to say , potentially , yes			0
that ’s why , when @entity0 initially bought a smaller stake in the club last year , the @entity61 struck a deal with him not to own more than 10 per cent or have ‘ boardroom influence ’ in the future – mirroring @entity68 ’s stance on such matters			1
@entity0 looks likely to choose former @entity1 director of football @entity45 ( right ) to join the board @entity51 also resigned from his position as director from the @entity2 board on friday the governing body has written to @entity0 for clarification but it seems highly unlikely they ’ll call him out on it			1
his £ 2m loan saved the club from going into administration , after all			2
but what of the potential for @entity2 and @entity1 to meet in @entity85 competition in the future ? both clubs and @entity68 will cross that bridge when they come to it			0
but bear in mind that @entity0 wants out of @entity1 by 2016			2
that ’s the earliest date when @entity2 could potentially be back in @entity85 competition , so it might never come to it			0
did the club have an alternative to @entity0 ’s proposal ? they had two			1
former @entity2 director @entity97 headed a consortium willing to invest an initial £ 16m in the club			2
@entity100 owner @entity99 was also in the frame with a finance package			0
in the end , the board sided with @entity0			1
@entity99 staged a desperate 11th hour bid on friday night to thwart @entity0 ’s move for control at @entity2 how has this gone down with the fans ? most were in favour of @entity97 and they now appear to be split down the middle			2
some can see no further than a man with a net worth of £ 3.75 billion and feel this can only be a good thing			0
@entity1 have turned a profit the past few years , for example			0
other are suspicious of the sportswear tycoon ’s motives			0
@entity122 scores during a win over @entity124 as @entity2 continued to make strides on the pitch @entity128 's side have won their last four games in a row as they pursue promotion to the top flight as well as a lucrative merchandising deal – @entity0 already takes a 49 per cent cut – he also has naming rights for the stadium which he picked up for £ 1 from @entity137			2
so far he has n’t activated this			0
if copyright on the club badge now belongs to @entity0 , fans fear his company - as opposed to @entity2 – only stands to profit			1
what about @entity128 ? despite suggestions he was under immediate threat , the @entity2 boss has been told his job is safe			0
but like everyone else at the club , he is now working under a cloud of uncertainty			2
@entity2 manager @entity128 has been assured of his position but everyone at the club will be uncertain			0

@entity0 *bailed* the club out with loan this week
former chief executive @entity37 left as a condition of the loan
@entity0 is set to place his own men on the board
