by @entity0 published : 20:39 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 05:47 est , 7 march 2013 an instant laser test for breast cancer is being developed by scientists			1
it is hoped that by quickly determining whether a suspicious lump is cancerous , the test will spare women time and worry , as well as cutting the cost for the @entity9			1
more than 1.5million @entity11 women have breast x-rays , or mammograms , each year			1
if their result is abnormal , the patient will often have a sample of cells withdrawn via a needle			0
up to 90 per cent of these needle biopsies come back negative			0
more than 1.5million @entity11 women have breast x-rays , or mammograms , each year			1
now an instant laser test for breast cancer is being developed by scientists in contrast , a technique developed by the @entity26 in @entity27 uses a laser to pinpoint dangerous changes without breaking the skin			1
carried out at the same time as the mammogram , the test would remove the need for a second hospital appointment , as well as the nerve - shredding wait for a result			2
@entity38 , of the @entity39 , the project ’s lead scientist , said : ‘ this technique , if applied at mammography , could have a huge impact on those 75,000 patients a year having to return for biopsies , with associated anxiety , when they are found to have nothing wrong			2
’ the test involves shining a laser on the suspicious area and analysing the reflected light			2
the pattern and colour of the light that is bounced back depends on the chemical composition of the breast – with cancerous lumps producing a different ‘ signature ’ to benign ones			0
tests on pieces of pork have produced promising results and work on human breast tissue is due to start			0
however , the need to prove the test to be highly accurate , as well as safe , means it will be a decade before it is routinely used in hospitals			0
the laser could also be used in airport security checks to spot liquid explosives and in quality control tests for drugs and medicines			0
the test involves shining a laser on the suspicious area and analysing the reflected light scientist @entity74 , who proved that the so - called @entity76 , or @entity77 , technique could be used to detect if a lump is malignant or benign , said : ‘ it is an exciting field of research and translation of the @entity77 technique to a clinical setting has the potential to reduce the amount of false positives and therefore reduce patient anxiety			2
’ professor @entity88 , who pioneered the technique with the @entity26 , said : ‘ it is very gratifying to see this technology , originally developed on our large facilities , being applied in so many different ways that will have such an impact on society			0
’ dr @entity97 , of @entity98 , said : ‘ if the researchers can prove this technology can tell what is cancer and what ’s not , it could save some women from an invasive test and an anxious wait			1
‘ this is the beginning of a long research journey , but shows how revolutions in technology could help improve medicine in the future			0
’ @entity113 , of @entity114 , said : ‘ accurate diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial so we are encouraged to see the development of new techniques which help identify the disease			1
‘ we look forward to the results of this study to see how successful the laser technique proves to be			0
‘ we welcome all research that moves us even closer to providing better diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer patients			1
’ women aged between 47 and 73 are entitled to a mammogram every three years , and it is estimated that the screening programme saves 1,400 lives a year			2
breast cancer is @entity11 ’s most common form of the disease and almost 50,000 cases are diagnosed each year			1
most are in women aged 50 - plus but younger women , and men , are also affected and the disease claims almost 1,000 lives a month .			0
