@entity0 hopes there will be one interested spectator in @entity3 when he leads out @entity4 in monday 's @entity6 fourth round clash against @entity7			1
the @entity9 side have made the last 32 for the second successive season and their reward is a home tie against @entity14 opposition			0
it is a big occasion for club and captain , but for some of @entity21 's former team - mates , big games are the norm every week			1
@entity4 captain @entity0 is hoping to impress a selection of his former team - mates @entity21 progressed through @entity26 's academy alongside the likes of @entity28 and @entity29 @entity21 came up through the @entity26 academy at the same time as @entity29 , @entity28 and @entity31 and shared a house with the trio , now of @entity3 , @entity34 and @entity35 respectively			1
' there were about 17 of us in the same house , ' said the defender			2
' my age , there were seven of us			0
unfortunately four are n't playing any more but obviously @entity29 and @entity28 have done well			1
then there was @entity31 , @entity45 , @entity46			0
' it was a good house to live in , some very good times			0
i 'm very good friends with @entity31 and @entity29			1
' it 's great to see those boys doing so well but you want a little bit of that yourself			2
you 've just got to keep working hard and hopefully one day it will happen			0
' while @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity31 quickly made their mark at the top level , @entity21 spent three spells on loan at @entity58 before being released by @entity26 in 2010			1
former @entity26 duo @entity28 and @entity29 have gone on to play for @entity34 and @entity3 respectively two years later he was released by @entity59 but the nadir was a season at his hometown club of @entity63			1
@entity64 restricted him to only 15 appearances and at the end of the campaign he was made redundant after the club went into administration			0
@entity21 admitted he questioned his future in the game , saying : ' there were definitely times			0
' my injury did n't seem to get any better			0
i had operations and injections and there were times when i sat down with my girlfriend and my dad and discussed it			0
but thankfully now that 's behind me and i can look forward			2
' in the summer of 2013 , the 26 - year - old headed north to sign a one - year contract at @entity4 and his career has been back on an upward trend ever since			1
he quickly established himself as a key member of the side and was given the captain 's armband on a permanent basis following the departure of @entity95 last summer			2
@entity21 is hoping to emulate @entity35 's @entity96 by working his way up the @entity98 settled with his girlfriend and four - and - a - half - month - old son @entity100 - ' a little northerner ' - @entity21 is at last looking back up the leagues			2
and it is the tale of another former @entity26 and @entity4 player , @entity35 striker @entity96 , that provides encouragement			1
@entity21 added : ' i 'm not saying i could play for @entity3 but obviously every player wants to play as high as possible			0
' i 'm in @entity9 at the moment and everyone wants to play @entity14 or @entity110			0
i 'm still quite young and hopefully with @entity4 and the gaffer here i can keep improving			1
' you 've only got to look at @entity96 , who played at @entity4			1
to see what he 's done is inspirational			2
i think as footballers , and as people , you should never stop dreaming			0
