@entity0 says it has foiled an audacious @entity2 plot to blow up oil pipelines and seize key ports , as @entity6 special operations forces reportedly prepare for action in the country			1
security forces thwarted a plan by terrorists to take over oil and gas export facilities and a provincial capital in the eastern part of the country , a government official said today			1
@entity16 , press advisor to @entity0 prime minister @entity17 , said the plot involved dozens of @entity2 militants dressed in @entity0 army uniforms storming the facilities on the night of the 27th of the @entity23 month of @entity24 , which was on sunday			1
the plot was apparently discovered after @entity6 intelligence officers intercepted a conference call between senior leaders of @entity2			1
@entity16 said : ' the plot aimed to seize the @entity48 oil export terminal in @entity49 [ province ] and the @entity52 gas export facility , as well as the city of @entity54 [ @entity49 provincial capital ]			1
' he said the bid was prevented by @entity0 forces deploying extra troops around the targeted facilities and banning anyone from entering			2
[ related ] news of the foiled plot emerged after the @entity6 evacuated some @entity6 diplomatic staff out of @entity0 and told nationals to leave the country immediately after warnings of potential attacks that had prompted @entity69 to shut missions across the @entity71			1
@entity33 , @entity72 , the @entity73 and @entity74 also closed their embassies in @entity76 and some evacuated their staff			2
it was not immediately clear if the foiled plot was linked to these security measures			0
@entity80 : @entity82 citizens make their way to the airport after the @entity85 ordered the evacuation of all non-essential personnel bomb fear : @entity2 terrorists may have developed a new liquid explosive that can be applied to clothing and is completely undetectable by current airport security systems @entity0 , one of the poorest @entity95 countries , is the base for @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , one of the most active branches of the network founded by @entity101 , and militants have launched attacks from there against the @entity82			1
it emerged today that officials are investigating the theory that @entity2 terrorists could try to bring down planes using an undetectable explosive soaked into their clothes			2
the organisation ’s bomb - makers are reportedly developing an ‘ ingenious ’ system whereby shirts and trousers drenched in the explosive could be ignited when dry			0
mastermind : the new explosive is believed to be the work @entity119 known as @entity2 's bomb - maker in chief it would be undetectable under current security measures and remove the need for terrorists to mix liquid explosives on board , security sources told the @entity6 tv network @entity129 yesterday			1
the latest threat to air passengers is one of the reasons behind the current global terror alert , according to two senior @entity6 government officials			0
@entity33 bomb expert @entity136 confirmed that the new method was possible using easily available chemicals , but pulling it off would be tricky as the soaking process would dilute the explosive			0
he said : ‘ the clothes act as a diluent and reduce the power of the explosives			0
’ however , igniting treated clothes could be done simply with a match			0
passengers are allowed to carry a single box of safety matches or a cigarette lighter on flights			0
the new explosive has reportedly been developed by the notorious bomb - maker @entity119 of @entity97 , who made the device used by convicted ‘ underwear bomber ’ @entity156 in his attempt to blow up a plane on christmas day in 2009			0
other reports have suggested that @entity160 is developing bombs that could be sewn under the skin of terrorists			0
the level of ‘ terror chatter ’ being monitored by security services has been described as one of the most serious threats to @entity6 and @entity82 interests since the 9/11 attacks			2
in response , the @entity171 last night evacuated all staff from the @entity33 embassy in @entity0			1
the @entity85 , based at the @entity175 , @entity69 ( pictured ) , has instructed its embassies and consulates in the @entity23 word that would normally be open on sunday to close this weekend amid reports of an unspecified threat checkpoint : a policeman searches a car at a post close to the @entity6 embassy in @entity76 , @entity0 those posted in @entity76 , the capital – including ambassador @entity187 , who has only been there a month – were told to return to the @entity33 because of ‘ increased security concerns ’			1
the @entity6 also ordered all non-essential personnel at its @entity0 embassy to get out , and @entity6 citizens still in the country were flown to safety by military aircraft			1
dozens of @entity2 operatives are said to have streamed into @entity76 in the past few days , forcing the country ’s military to use ‘ extraordinary and unprecedented ’ security measures to protect official buildings			1
at the same time , at least four suspected terrorists have been killed in an @entity6 drone strike in the eastern @entity208 region of @entity0			1
the drone fired a missile at a car carrying the four men , setting it on fire and killing all of them , the officials said			0
on sunday 20 @entity6 embassies and consulates were closed after conversations between two senior @entity2 figures			1
the @entity6 @entity220 in @entity221 ( pictured ) , the capital of @entity223 , is among those closed in @entity227 , @entity225 , where thousands of @entity6 troops remain stationed , the @entity220 ( pictured ) will also be closed this sunday speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to talk to the media , the officials said they believe one of the dead is @entity234 , a senior @entity2 member			1
it 's the fourth drone attack in the past week to hit a car believed to be carrying @entity2 members			2

@entity82 embassies in the capital of @entity76 are also being protected			0
the @entity85 said in a travel warning that it had ordered the departure of non-emergency @entity6 government personnel from @entity0 ' due to the continued potential for terrorist attacks ' and said @entity6 citizens in @entity0 should leave immediately because of an ' extremely high ' security threat level			1
' as staff levels at the @entity220 are restricted , our ability to assist @entity6 citizens in an emergency and provide routine consular services remains limited and may be further constrained by the fluid security situation , ' the travel warning said			2
electronic communications were picked up several weeks ago between @entity42 ( left ) - the head of the global terror network who succeeded @entity101 - and @entity43 ( right ) the @entity259 reports that the @entity175 and the @entity6 state department say the current threat comes from @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , but have refused to release further details			0
the @entity33 @entity171 said in a statement : ' due to increased security concerns , all staff in the @entity33 embassy have been temporarily withdrawn and the embassy will remain closed until staff are able to return			1
' several @entity270 countries have also temporarily shut missions in @entity0			0
known as @entity2 's bomb - maker in chief , @entity119 is believed to be behind a range of explosive devices including pant bombs and liquid explosive implants which contain no metal parts making them virtually undetectable			2
@entity160 , 31 , who is linked to the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) group , was reported to have recruited his own brother @entity279 as a suicide bomber in a failed 2009 attempt to assassinate @entity283 's deputy minister of the interior			0
an early version of his pant bomb was used in the the 2009 christmas day bomb plot , when a @entity288 man attempted unsuccessfully to detonate the device aboard a flight from @entity291 to @entity292			0
an updated version , which incorporated fail - safe triggers and used a new kind of explosive that was even harder to detect was supplied for a terrorist attack in may last year to mark the anniversary of @entity101 ’s death			0
that plot was foiled when the suicide bomber turned out to be a double agent and handed the device to the @entity303 he is also believed to have been behind an intercepted pair of explosives - laden printers that were mailed from @entity0 to the @entity6 in 2010			2
in september last year he was reported as having been possibly killed in a drone strike together with other @entity97 suspects but a @entity0 government official later denied the claim			0
he is currently considered to be one of @entity6 's most wanted men			2
' he ’s the main guy , ' said one counterterrorism official			0
' he ’s the top of any list			0
' @entity160 has been described as a critical component of @entity2 's activities in @entity0 and his death would be a significant blow to the organization .			1
