in the future , your phone will know your everyday activities so well , it will automatically realise when it has been stolen			0
that ’s the thinking behind the latest software developed by @entity7 researchers			0
by combining data from various sensors in the phone , the app knows when it is being used by an unfamiliar person , or taken to an unknown location			2
it then asks for an authentication code before being unlocked			0
the software was created by @entity18 and uses phone sensors to build a profile of the user ’s behaviour			1
for example , it tracks which apps they use on daily basis , uses @entity29 sensors to learn which networks are typically within that user ’s vicinity , as well as how they typically hold a device ‘ mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are rapidly becoming our digital identity , ’ explained professor just and his colleagues from @entity18 in their ‘ @entity37 authentication : on the @entity39 with @entity40 ’ paper			1
‘ they are used for payments and authentication , and they store valuable information			0
the software uses sensors in phones to build a profile of the user			1
for example , it tracks which apps they use on daily basis			0
it also uses @entity29 sensors to learn which networks are typically within that user ’s vicinity on a daily or weekly basis , as well as which mobile towers they travel near			1
the accelerometer can even determine how a user typically holds a device			0
in addition , the phone uses sensors to learn about a user 's environments , such as how light their home is , or how noisy their office is			1
the data from all these available sensors are combined to create a ' comfort score			1
' if the location is unknown , or sensor data has never been encountered , the score is zero			0
if comfort levels drop below 0.2 , suggesting the behaviours are out of the ordinary , the device will ask for an authentication code to unlock			2
‘ their relatively low cost , ease of use and ‘ always on ’ connectivity provides a suitable platform for many day - to - day tasks involving money and sensitive data , which in turn makes mobile devices an attractive attack target			2
’ the software uses the sensors built into phones to build a profile of the user			1
for example , it tracks which apps they use on a daily basis , and if there are any patterns in terms of which order they are opened in , or how long they use them			0
it also uses @entity29 sensors to learn which networks are typically within that user ’s vicinity on a daily or weekly basis , as well as which mobile towers they travel near			1
the accelerometer can even determine how a user typically holds a device			0
in addition , the phone uses sensors to learn about the user 's environments , such as how light their home is , or how noisy their office is			1
the data from all these available sensors were combined to create a so - called comfort score based on its frequency for the given time and location			1
if the location is unknown , or the sensor data has never been encountered for that location , the comfort score is zero			1
and because some sensors provide more than one input , such as noise and light , the readings were used more than once			0
the data from all these available sensors were combined to create a so - called comfort score based on its frequency for the given time and location			1
pictured are three individual usage patterns for researchers involved in the study if comfort levels drop below 0.2 , suggesting the behaviours are out of the ordinary , the device asks for an authentication code to unlock after the software has learnt the user ’s behaviours , it initiates ‘ deployment mode ’ , and the device automatically sets a detection threshold to be 0.2			1
this means that if comfort levels drops below 0.2 , suggesting the behaviours are out of the ordinary , the device will ask for an authentication code to unlock			2
this can be different to the user ’s pin , and unique to that user and device			2
the software is adaptive enough to recognise that small deviations from normal behaviour is expected , but larger changes will trigger a response			0
during four separate tests , the comfort level dropped substantially below the owner ’s average and there was a detection rate of 95 per cent			0
the only exception was when a friend or family - member , known as an ‘ informed insider ’ used the device			0
professor just explained that it takes a week , on average , for the software to learn its user ’s activity			2
the software will undergo further tests before it can be released more widely to consumers .			0

the software was created by experts at @entity18
it uses phone sensors to build a profile of the user ’s behaviour
this *includes* which apps they use , how they hold their device and even how noisy their office is
data from these sensors is the combined to create a ‘ comfort score ’
if a thief uses the phone , and score drops below 0.2 , it triggers a response
after three minutes of *unusual* use , the phone locks and asks for a code
