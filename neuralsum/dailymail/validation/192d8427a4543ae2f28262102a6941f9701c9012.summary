a probe into how police handled child sexual exploitation in @entity3 is looking into allegations against 42 officers after complaints were sent to the force watchdog			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) was already examining allegations against ten officers involved in the investigation into one of the country 's most prolific child abuse rings			1
but today the commission said it had received 30 new complaints containing 100 allegations about 42 officers involved in the @entity3 investigation			1
the @entity8 is examining 100 allegations made against 42 officers from @entity20 who investigated child sex abuse in @entity3 ( file image ) the complaints came in the wake of the @entity25 , which described how 1,400 children , mainly girls , were routinely raped , trafficked and groomed in @entity27 between 1997 and 2013 it said in a statement : ' the complaints contain more than 100 allegations against 42 named police officers , both retired and serving , as well as a number of allegations against officers whose identities are currently unknown			1
' the complaints followed on from the @entity25 , which described how at least 1,400 children were raped , trafficked and groomed in the @entity27 town between 1997 and 2013			1
the @entity8 statement said : ' work to establish the identity of the unknown officers and to identify any links between the different complaints and incidents is ongoing			2
' the allegations range from neglect of duty by failing to adequately investigate on the basis of intelligence or to deal with incidents appropriately , inappropriate comments and suggestions of corrupt relationships between police officers and offenders			2
' the commission said it was also investigating an allegation that @entity20 failed to act on information passed to them in 2004 and 2006 about alleged child abuse in nearby @entity62			2
this complaint relates to two named police officers who are now retired from the police service , the @entity8 said			1
the @entity25 , published in august last year , sparked furious debate about the tragic crimes which took place in @entity3 , and how the perpetrators went unchallenged for so long			0
the @entity71 report found that the abuse went unchallenged as police and council chiefs were afraid of being labelled racist , as the perpetrators were largely gangs of @entity78 men professor @entity71 , who wrote the report , described how hundreds of vulnerable teenagers , mainly girls , were routinely exploited by gangs of mainly @entity78 men with impunity			0
police and senior council officers were accused of failing to tackle the problem for fear of being seen as racist , and of ignoring or doubting the victim 's accounts			0
a wave of high profile resignations followed and the @entity92 was brought in to investigate the crimes and how they were handled			0
the @entity25 was followed by another report by @entity95 , which was scathing in its criticism of @entity98 and led to the replacement of the local authority 's ruling cabinet with commissioners appointed by communities secretary @entity103			0
after more revelations about the scale of exploitation in neighbouring @entity62 , the @entity107 , @entity108 , last month called for a wide - ranging inspection of his force , along the lines of ms @entity95 's review of the council 's actions .			0

@entity8 was investigating ten officers
@entity118 has now been *expanded* after 30 new complaints were received
complaints contain 100 allegations against 42 named police officers
came in wake of @entity126 that described routine abuse of 1,400 children
