the 120 tonne ship has lain on the sea bed for nearly 400 years but divers think they have finally found its remains off the coast of @entity35 , along with @entity37 guns and pottery			1
early analysis of the wreckage has proved inconclusive but @entity41 has this week sent off hull samples to be carbon dated by experts in a bid to solve the mystery once and for all			1
divers @entity48 and @entity50 found the wreck in the summer of 2012 after using a magnetometer to pinpoint unusual objects on the seabed			0
they say their photos and artefacts prove it is sir @entity2 ’s ship , but experts have never verified the find			1

‘ @entity41 can not commit to any association with sir @entity2 until we have completed our investigation of the site and have analysed the results of tree - ring dating , which we will be undertaking within the next few months , to determine whether the hull timbers are @entity123 or not , ’ he added			1
the wreckage pictured is temporarily being called the @entity133 until samples are radiocarbon dates to determine whether the vessel belonged to sir @entity2 the 120 tonne ship has lain on the sea bed for nearly 400 years but divers think they have finally found its remains off the coast of @entity35 , along with @entity37 guns and @entity37 pottery			1
