thirty years after @entity2 forces liberated the @entity3 from @entity5 invaders , the two countries are still at odds over who has the more legitimate claim to the land			1
but it seems the inhabitants of the island would prefer to be left to their own devices , with just one in three saying they actually feel @entity2			1
a census in the self - governing @entity16 found that an overwhelming 59 percent say their national identity is ' @entity18 '			2
just 29 per cent admit feeling ' @entity2 '			1
more than half of inhabitants of the @entity3 consider themselves ' @entity3 ' rather than ' @entity2 ' the census results have implications for @entity5 , which refuses to deal directly with the @entity3 ' local government and accuses @entity2 of running what @entity5 call the @entity3 as an illegal colony			1
the survey also puts the average annual income at $ 32,213 ( £ 20,015 ) , much higher than @entity5 's $ 9,620 ( £ 5,977 ) as of last year , or that of the @entity3 ' other @entity30 neighbors			1
the income figure underlines how much things have changed since before the 1982 war			2
back then , wool prices had bottomed out internationally and invading @entity5 soldiers were told they would be welcomed by impoverished and oppressed tenant farmers			1
instead , they encountered a stubbornly defiant population that helped @entity2 troops retake the islands			1
sheltered by continued military support , @entity18 have seen their livelihoods greatly improve since the war , with revenue flowing in from fisheries , tourism and offshore oil development			2
but the census also reveals a problem : the islands ' population has n't grown since the last survey was done in 2006			2
there are only 2,563 residents after civilian contractors and @entity2 military personnel and their dependents are excluded			1
the population is aging rapidly , too , with the ranks of people older than 65 increasing by 14 percent in the last six years			2
' if the @entity3 is to progress we need to increase our population , ' said @entity62 , a 73 - year - old retired power station manager who was born in @entity63			0
liberation : the @entity66 flag is hoisted over @entity67 , @entity68 , for the first time in more than two months by @entity70 , @entity71 signifying the end of the @entity3 conflict claim : @entity71 go ashore in the @entity3 during the height of the conflict in may 1982 the census shows unemployment at just 1 percent , with one - fifth of all workers having multiple jobs			0
the largest employer by far is the government , at 28 percent , followed by agriculture ( 11 percent ) and hospitality and tourism ( 11 percent )			0
offshore oil and gas development could bring sudden wealth to the islands if several drilling efforts strike it rich			0
but the effort currently employs just 26 islanders , and there simply are n't enough people around to work the jobs created by a growing economy			1
' there is virtually no spare capacity within the labor market to accommodate any additional employment opportunities that may arise in the future			0
indeed , almost 20 percent of persons in employment have more than one job , ' the government said tuesday			0
the census shows immigration slowing , due to one of the world 's most restrictive policies : newcomers are n't allowed to apply for islander status , giving them voting rights among other things , until they have completed seven years of residency			0
that can be done only by repeatedly renewing temporary labor contracts			0
even then , only 40 people can apply each year , and not all are accepted			0
the census says 70 per cent of the population , 1,973 people , are @entity3 or @entity121 .			0

over half of islanders call themselves ' @entity125 ' rather than ' @entity2 '
less than one in ten identify themselves as @entity5
