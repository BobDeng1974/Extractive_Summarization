' you knew she was not nearly 16 , as she said , and your plea of guilty recognises that you knew			0
‘ allowing her to visit your home is something we have to clamp down on and in normal circumstances that would mean a significant term in prison			0
lenient : paedophile @entity18 was spared a jail sentence at @entity72 ‘ on these facts , the girl was predatory and was egging you on			1
that is no defence when dealing with children but i am prepared to impose a suspension			0

’ a spokesman for the attorney general ’s office said : ‘ the case has been drawn to the attention of this office as a possibly unduly lenient sentence			0
‘ this means it ’ll be considered by a law officer ( the attorney or solicitor general ) who will decide whether it should be referred to the @entity80 under the unduly lenient sentence scheme			0
‘ the law officers have 28 days to make their considerations , this office will ask the @entity81 for more information on the case and the decision will be announced once all the information has been considered			2
’ a @entity81 spokesman added : ' the word predatory in this context should not have been used and is of real concern to the @entity81			1
it is not consistent with the work that we have undertaken alongside the judiciary and others in the past year to improve attitudes towards victims of abuse			0
' we expect all of our prosecutors , including self - employed barristers who act on our behalf , to follow our guidance in these very difficult cases			1
