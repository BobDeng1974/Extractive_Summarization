it is not just the unstoppable march of the @entity2 or television continually tinkering with kick - off times that threaten the @entity5 but a coiffured former @entity7 midfielder with a microphone			1
the @entity5 ’s fruitless search to find a sponsor for its showpiece competition really was a waste of time : the top brass at @entity15 could just have plastered the name @entity17 over the famous trophy instead			1
he is seemingly everywhere , infiltrating the country ’s airwaves , television screens and internet browsers with his peculiar brand of laddish , enthusiastic waffle			2
former @entity7 midfielder @entity17 ( left ) makes a point to fellow pundit @entity27 on @entity28 on any weekend you can find @entity17 flitting between @entity31 , @entity33 television and @entity34 @entity35 ( left ) was caught muttering an expletive under his breath on @entity38 with @entity39 and @entity40 ‘ for me ’ , the @entity17 catchphrase that introduces every hastily - concocted opinion , has become an intrinsic part of football ’s vernacular			1
we are well past the point of saturation now , worn down by five years of peroxide , fake tan and hyperactivity			0
please @entity52 , let it end			0
on any weekend you can find @entity17 flitting between @entity31 , @entity33 television and @entity34 and , if that is n’t enough suffering , you can read his bland comments in his red - top newspaper column or on a betting website or @entity62 ’s website			1
there is no escape from the wall - to - wall scourge of @entity17			1
the poor @entity5 has taken a particular hammering this season from @entity17 , who likes to pit himself as a man of the people , a hard - working underdog who maximised his talent to take on the big boys , just like the best @entity5 heroes			2
@entity75 ( above ) was distinctly unimpressed by @entity17 ’s animated defence of @entity78 ’s challenge 1 - ‘ you need to take off your rose - scented glasses ’ — responding to a caller on his saturday radio phone - in			1
2 - ‘ football is easy ’ — insight during @entity84 ’s @entity5 win against @entity85 on sunday			2
3 - ‘ outside the box , that ’s a free - kick but inside the box , i do n’t think it ’s a penalty ’ — rewrites the rule book while discussing a contentious decision			2
4 - ‘ @entity93 is stupid ’ — the second most booked player in the @entity2 slams the style of @entity93 at the @entity96			0
5 - ‘ @entity97 crossed every i and dotted every t ’ — defends @entity100 after he quit @entity7 to join @entity101 in september , 2004			1
@entity17 ’s well - tested formula involves stating something incorrect , over-simplified or blindingly obvious in that harsh , excitable voice and then ramming it home for 90 minutes of painful co-commentary			1
and yet @entity106 does not stop there			0
@entity17 also regularly features on @entity108 , 5 @entity38 ’s football phone - in 606 and @entity28 and took part in an @entity5 special edition of the gameshow @entity113			1
then there is the fawning , matey vehicle of self - promotion that is @entity38 with @entity39 and @entity40 , @entity34 ’s saturday morning warm - up show , which takes place against a backdrop that looks like a five - year - old has gone bonkers with a set of neon paints after consuming two bags of @entity125			1
nowhere , it seems , is safe from the self - styled ‘ @entity128 man ’ and former @entity130 contestant			2
he dressed up in a canary yellow suit to promote @entity34 ’s coverage of transfer deadline day and freely laughed at the mockery that followed the @entity33 ’s decision to put ‘ @entity17 : @entity139 ’ alongside the decorated @entity137 and @entity138 at last year ’s @entity96			1
the @entity140 competed alongside dancer @entity141 in the 2011 season of @entity130 ‘ i was most relieved @entity137 and @entity138 knew who i was , ’ @entity17 later posted on @entity143			1
but if we hoped the fan on the sofa had gone with the demise of @entity149 , we are to be disappointed			0
@entity35 mouthed an expletive on live television in response to one @entity17 soliloquy , while @entity75 was distinctly unimpressed by the @entity140 ’s animated defence of @entity156 ’s @entity78 ’s challenge on @entity158 striker @entity157 in november			1
‘ @entity106 , it was a red card , ’ said @entity75 , wearily			0
the former @entity162 striker was also quick to mock @entity17 ’s assertion that ‘ football ’s easy ’ during his hopeless stint in the commentary box for the @entity84 v @entity167 tie last weekend			1
‘ i saw you play , mate			0
is it really ? ’ added @entity75			0
@entity17 , though , sees this as ‘ banter ’			2
he appears to revel in it , just as he happily rebuts the deluge of @entity143 abuse that comes his way after every television , radio , online or newspaper appearance			0
but then @entity17 would prefer people to talk about him in any way rather than not at all , even if his desire for popularity sometimes verges on the desperate			2
‘ i ’ve always wanted to be liked , ’ he said in a recent interview with @entity186			0
@entity17 dressed up in a canary yellow suit to promote @entity34 ’s coverage of transfer deadline day the thing about @entity128 , though , is that somebody must like it			1
@entity17 , now 40 , has 1.4million @entity143 followers yet it is a struggle to find vocal supporters outside the band of radio and tv executives who adore him for his undoubted work ethic and willingness to make a complete prat of himself			2
the gigs , after all , just keep on coming			0
@entity17 won the @entity203 in 2011 , receiving more votes in the public poll than any previous recipient of the prize			0
remarkably , it is also understood @entity17 scores favourably in focus groups			0
@entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 must have spent a fortune planting punters in these audience feedback sessions or else the participants are all wearing their hero ’s brand of ‘ rose - scented glasses ’ , as he once famously remarked			0
@entity17 did not impress with his hopeless stint in the commentary box for the @entity84 vs @entity167 tie there must , after all , surely be something better than this			0
why are we subjected to @entity17 every time we turn on the radio or television ? there should of course be room for football pundits who do not take themselves too seriously , but their primary purpose is to inform and explain and @entity17 rarely does either			1
those close to him say he is a decent , well - meaning bloke who does a lot of charity work and works incredibly hard , but that does not mean we want to listen to him rattle on for 90 minutes or that we care what he has to say at half - time , either			0
volume of opinion does not compensate for lack of substance .			0

on any weekend you can find @entity17 flitting between @entity31 , @entity33 television and @entity34
@entity17 also regularly features on @entity108 , 5 @entity38 ’s football phone - in 606 and @entity28
the former @entity7 midfielder also competed on @entity130
