by @entity0 published : 16:58 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 16:59 est , 10 april 2013 @entity2 ' victim has spoken for the first time about her horrific ordeal a rape victim who was bound , nearly burnt alive and repeatedly stabbed has been left with the tip of her attacker 's blade permanently stuck in her head			1
@entity10 , 35 , burst into his victim 's home with a large kitchen knife when she was sleeping before threatening : ' do n't say anything or i will kill you '			1
he then subjected the terrified 46 - year - old to a harrowing knifepoint sexual assault in her bedroom before tying her to the bed with her clothes and wires			1
@entity25 then stuffed her mouth with clothing , bound her so she could not move and set fire to the bed she was lying on in her home in @entity31			1
she frantically tried to escape but @entity25 launched a relentless knife attack - stabbing her more than 11 times in the chest , neck , face and head			1
the brave woman remarkably survived the chilling ordeal but has been left with the tip of the kitchen knife lodged behind her ear			1
@entity25 , who had been released from prison just nine days before the attack , is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 15 years			1
speaking for the first time after the october 2010 attack , his victim , who can not be named for legal reasons , described her experience as ' like a horror film '			1
she told how she awoke in her bedroom in the early hours of the morning to find him at the door brandishing a knife			2
' you see that sort of thing in horror films - it was like being in a horror film , ' she said			2
the woman ( not pictured ) managed to flee the house where she was raped , stabbed and nearly burnt alive ' it 's the most horrific thing that anyone could ever do to you			1
' he was vile , but he did n't beat me			2
i got the better of him by getting out alive and i 'm proud of myself for that			2
' everyone is different , but when i saw him with that kitchen knife i was frightened , but i just felt really alert			2
' i used every bit of information i had to survive			2
i went into survival mode			2
' the woman used previous knowledge of self - defence to prevent @entity25 from taking her life			1
@entity25 had been out of prison on licence for just over a week , having served three - and - a - half years for robbery , assault , possession of an offensive weapon and theft			1
he entered the house of his victim - who had been asleep alone in her bedroom - and inflicted the harrowing injuries through the sustained attack			1
@entity25 took her personal possessions , including her bank cards and told her he would not harm her if she gave him her pin numbers			1
she did and @entity25 left her alone in her bedroom - before returning twice more to rape her , stab her , and attempt to burn her alive			1
he set alight two fires in her home , one on the bed which she was tied to and another by stuffing lit clothes down the back of a radiator in her downstairs hallway			1
the woman said : ' i was tied up and he set fire to the bed			1
that 's when i realised this is it , i 'm going to die if i do n't do something			2
' i was telling him to get out and that 's the point when he started stabbing me			2
i came down the stairs and he was still waiting for me			2
' he was acting like someone in a horror film at that point and started attacking me again with the knife			0
' i remember him stabbing me in the back of the head			0
i did n't feel any pain - it was pure survival			0
you hear someone screaming and then your realise it 's you			0
' i ended up on the floor			0
apparently he stamped on my head too , but i was losing consciousness			0
' but the woman managed to flee from her burning property and alerted a neighbour who called police			1
officers launched a massive manhunt and @entity25 , who has 20 previous convictions , was arrested two days later , on october 3 , in @entity144 , @entity31			1
he refused to answer any questions but later admitted charges of attempted murder , rape , arson and aggravated burglary			0
it transpired he had stolen just Â£ 250 from the woman , which he used to buy drugs			1
his victim was left with chest wounds , a collapsed lung , 13 wounds to her head , face , arms and neck			0
she lost all of her possessions in the fire and has been left with pain from severed muscles			0
the woman added : ' it 's something you live with every day			1
you ca n't forget it or blank it out			0
you always feel like someone is trying to kill you			0
' i have to tell people my story			0
that 's helped my recovery - not keeping it a secret			0
when i speak about it i feel like i 'm helping myself and hopefully helping someone else			0
' for me , i 'm not emotional about it often			0
i try not to break down			0
' she has been helped by @entity186 in @entity31 , as well as police and supportive friends and family			0
' the main thing that gives me comfort is the police caught him and he 's gone away for a long time ' , she added			0
' for some victims , the attacker is still walking the streets			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
