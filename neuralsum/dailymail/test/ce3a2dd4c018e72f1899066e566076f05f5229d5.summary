a @entity1 writer has claimed @entity2 is more racist than her homeland - where segregation by skin colour used to be law			1
while she originally called @entity1 home , @entity7 , 41 , moved to @entity2 with her husband and children in the last few months			1
as a journalist and an activist , she has spent years writing about and commenting on human rights , race relations and government accountability in @entity1 , including a stint working for the @entity17			2
however , upon relocating she said she 's been faced with the realisation , that much like her native @entity1 : ‘ the deepest and most abiding forms of racism ’ in @entity2 are directed toward our own indigenous population			1
' a lot of the people i speak with say ‘ i just treat you as a human , i do n’t see race ’ but they have to remember that people have different experiences because of their race everyday ' ‘ when i say something or someone is racist , it ’s not meant to be the worst insult in the world , people really get their backs up and this has only made the conversation about race so immature , ' she told @entity42			0
' i think the racist element [ in @entity2 ] lies in the difficulty in grappling with past and present			1
there is a reluctance to admit and accept that this country , like the @entity47 or @entity48 , has deep seeded race issues			0
' while protests about @entity53 infiltrating @entity2 have dominated the media , ms @entity7 said she started to recognise a systematic approach to ' assimilate ’ and ' eradicate ' @entity2 ’s @entity57 heritage , simply by denying that @entity58 's have different needs to white @entity2			1

‘ we are all committed to building a better @entity2 by talking about principals that we hold dear , one of which is the entitlement to a fair go , however at the same time people do n't realise that people of colour do n’t always have a fair go			2
' ms @entity7 said we can only reach level footing by recognising that difference is n't always a bad thing			2
she beleives while we continue to ‘ treat everyone exactly the same ’ we 'll only further deny how race affects those with different values			0
in her article ms @entity7 said the @entity2 government employed tactics of ‘ trickery , disposition and violence ’ that are ‘ as ugly as you ’ll find anywhere in the world ’			1
‘ aboriginal people are over-represented in the criminal justice system , and have health and educational outcomes that – if they were taken alone – would make @entity2 look like a developing country , ’ she wrote			2
ms @entity7 slammed prime minster @entity103 for his ' out of touch ' comments that claim @entity2 could no longer ‘ subsidize lifestyle choices if those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in @entity2 society that everyone should have			1
’ she condemned the federal government ’s plans to cut funding for ‘ remote ’ communities in june this year that could lead to the closure of around 150 rural communities predominately populated by @entity57			0
ms @entity7 slammed prime minster @entity103 for his ' out of touch ' comments that claim @entity2 could no longer ‘ subsidize lifestyle choices if those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in @entity2 society that everyone should have			1
’ ‘ @entity103 is the poster child for foot in mouth and it ’s not really surprising that he would make a racist statement and not apologise for it , ’ ms @entity123 told @entity42			2
she said @entity129 people do n't make a ' lifestyle choice ' to live on the land , instead , it 's their connection with country that 's meant they 've stayed there and the fact that such plans could be even contemplated speaks to a ‘ far larger problems in this country			1
’ in ms @entity7 ’s eyes , forcing @entity57 communities who have an innate ‘ connection to country ’ to leave their homes and ‘ assimilate ’ into normal ‘ civilised ’ society mirrors our gruesome history where children were systematically torn from their families and ‘ taught the ways of white society			2

’ ‘ right now the conversation in @entity2 exists in the past which only allows people to say ‘ oh , they need to get over it , we used to be racist but we are n’t anymore ' while ms @entity165 made note that these ‘ startling ’ practices are all too similar to those implemented during @entity1 ’s apartheid , she maintains @entity1 has started to move forward by recognising race difference where @entity2 continues to deny the issue			1
‘ right now the conversation in @entity2 exists in the past which only allows people to say ‘ ' oh , they need to get over it , we used to be racist but we are n’t anymore '' , ' she said			1
ms @entity165 thinks we need to start thinking about reconciliation in a more ' balanced ' way that accurately recognises history and difference			0
‘ in my country it is incredible how far admission of guilt has gotten people			0
for many , the beginning of building better race relations is saying ‘ yes i have benefited from a system that has been really crappy for you and your people '			0
’ @entity190 are pictured burning the passbooks they were forced to carry which stopped them accessing white only areas during the apartheid ‘ the issue for aboriginal people is that they 're still such a minority and that makes it hard for them to define the terms of the conversation			0
’ she said @entity2 's need to ‘ lance the wound ’ so they can have conversations based on honesty rather than ' fake kindness ’ ‘ @entity2 ’s are the nicest racists i have ever met but you have to realise we [ black people ] are not going to break if we start to have real conversations about difference			1
in fact , it will only make us stronger			0
’ @entity1 ’s apartheid illustrates a dark history of institutionalised racial discrimination that was enforced between 1948 and 1994			2
the controversial race laws touched on every major aspect of life including , prohibition of marriage between non-whites and whites , the sanctioning of ‘ white only ’ areas , the banning of political protest and the classification of all @entity1 as either white , black or mixed			0
all coloured people were required to carry ‘ passbooks ’ that contained a photo , fingerprints and information on accessing ‘ non-white ’ areas			0
non-compliance with race laws were dealt with harshly including fines , whipping and imprisonment			0
notably in 1960 , a large group of @entity1 refused to carry their passes and the government responded by declaring a state of emergency that lasted for 156 days , leaving 69 dead and 187 wounded			0

writer @entity7 said @entity2 are being racist by denying there are no differences between races
@entity7 slammed @entity103 for cutting funds to remote communities
many of these communities comprise @entity129
she compared treatment of @entity129 people to @entity1 's apartheid
she thinks @entity2 need to recognise and *celebrate* difference rather than deny its existence .
