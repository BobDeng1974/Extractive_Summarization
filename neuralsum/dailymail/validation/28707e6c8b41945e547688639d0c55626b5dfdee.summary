astronomers believe mysterious signals - previously dismissed as stellar bursts - are coming from an @entity4 - like planet			1
the @entity6 planet has conditions that could support life , and is likely to be a rocky world , twice the size of @entity4			1
signals from the planet were initially discovered in 2010 , but last year dismissed as noise from distant stars			1
the @entity6 planet was initially discovered in 2010 ( artist 's impression pictured ) now , a further study claims that the 2014 research was based on ' inadequate analyses of the data ' and that @entity6 does exist			1
the planet was initially discovered in 2010			2
it was the first @entity4 - like planet found in the ' @entity29 around another star			1
but soon after the discovery , a group of scientists said the signals thought to be from a planet were in fact simply magnetic bursts from stars			1
the latest study claims that the stellar bursts research was based on ' inadequate analyses of the data '			1
they said the method is suitable for large planets , but the technique is unable to find small planets like gj 581d			0
last year , @entity49 researchers said @entity51 581d - and its companion @entity50 - were simply a trick of the light caused by magnetic bursts from a local star 22 light - years away			2
the new @entity58 research , however , argues the method used by the @entity61 team was only suitable for large planets , and that it could miss small ones like gj 581d			0
the study , by @entity65 , @entity66 and the @entity67 , claims to use a more accurate model on the existing data			0
' the existence ( or not ) of gj 581d is significant because it was the first @entity4 - like planet discovered in the ' @entity29 around another star and it is a benchmark case for the @entity74 technique , ' said lead author , dr @entity76			2
' there are always discussions among scientists about the ways we interpret data but i 'm confident that @entity71 has been in orbit around @entity51 all along			2
' in any case , the strength of their statement was way too strong			0
' if their way to treat the data had been right , then some planet search projects at several ground - based observatories would need to be significantly revised as they are all aiming to detect even smaller planets			1
the @entity6 planet is likely to be a rocky world , twice the size of @entity4			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of the planetary orbits of the @entity51 system compared to those of our own solar system according to one of @entity109 's top planet hunters , we will find a planet with oceans like @entity4 in the next 15 years			2
dr @entity112 is an astrophysicist at the @entity113 in @entity114 , and the senior project scientist on the @entity116 ( @entity116 )			0
the giant telescope will be used to find the first bright objects that formed in the universe , figure out how galaxies evolved and find out how stars formed			0
but perhaps most excitingly , it will study @entity4 - like worlds beyond our solar system			0
' we hope to find a planet that 's @entity4 - like and measure its atmosphere to work out if it has enough water on it to make an ocean , ' he said in an interview with ' i think that will be in around ten to 15 years from now			1
' in that time we might be able to say : ' i can see that star over there			0
[ its planet ] has a climate that 's like @entity4 and it might have life on it			2
' ' one needs to be more careful with these kind of claims ' @entity71 is believed to be the first planet outside our solar system in the @entity146 around its star – an area not too hot and not too cold for life			2
to find @entity6 , @entity151 , @entity150 astronomers originally looked for subtle changes in light caused by the gravity of an orbiting planet tugging back and forth on the star			1
the strength of the tugging , they believed , showed them a planet was about three times as massive as @entity4			0
at the time , the discovery of @entity4 - like planets around @entity51 caught the public imagination			0
documentary - maker @entity165 and social - networking site @entity164 used a radio telescope in @entity169 to send a powerful focused beam of information - 500 messages from the public in the form of radio waves - to @entity51			0
and the @entity177 science minister at the time organised 20,000 users of @entity180 to send messages towards the distant solar system in the wake of the discoveries			0
other exoplanets have previously been doubted , most notably @entity186 , the closest @entity4 - sized world to us , which some scientists claim could just be noise in the data			0
@entity51 ( the bright star shown in the centre ) , which is 22 light - years away , has three other confirmed planets , none of which lie within its habitable zone			1

@entity6 is in star 's habitable zone and may be suitable for humans
found in 2010 , it was later dismissed as stellar bursts and not a planet
now , scientists believe earlier analysis was based on *inaccurate* data
they say planet does exist and may provide hope for finding alien life
