when the big fights do n’t happen the public lose faith			0
that is happening with @entity3			2
he is the king of the ring and the king of making money			0
but fight week seems particularly flat and i ’m hearing from my people in @entity9 that there is not the buzz or even much interest in his fight with @entity15			2
he should be fighting @entity16			2
that fight is credible again after he beat @entity18 and it is ridiculous that they are not facing each other			2
people know what to expect – a masterclass from @entity3 and an easy night			2
i might be wrong but that ’s how i see it			2
many are talking about projected pay - per - view numbers of less than one million , which for @entity3 is weak			1
it shows that people are losing interest			0
@entity3 will continue to make huge money , but the only fight people want to see @entity3 take is @entity16			1
i think people have got bored of not getting what they want and if you are continuously asking people to put their hand in their pocket , you have to give them what they want			2
@entity70 ’s long wait for a world title shot is nearly over			1
@entity73 ’s knockout win over @entity74 this month has meant that @entity73 must now defend his @entity76 title against @entity70 , the mandatory challenger , by july 19 or vacate the belt			1
plenty has been going on behind the scenes with this one and i can tell you more here			0
i have already spoken to @entity81 this week , the ceo of @entity83 , who look after @entity73 , and i have told him that i want to bring this fight to the @entity86			1
all being well , my offer would be to stage the fight in @entity89 , possibly on july 12			1
@entity90 has come : @entity70 will finally get his shot at a world title now @entity73 is obligated to defend return : @entity70 could take on @entity73 in @entity89 , where @entity70 took down @entity94 @entity93 @entity81 is happy to listen to offers but there is a long way to go			1
ultimately , they would like the fight in @entity9 and we have no problem with that , but i think it makes more sense for it to be in the @entity86			0
there is more interest for it here because @entity73 does n’t yet put bums on seats in @entity9 and that fight does n’t carry main event pull with the network			1
i suspect @entity81 and @entity73 ’s adviser , @entity115 , are worried about this fight			1
@entity73 was good against @entity74 , but he ca n’t afford to be as reckless as he was against someone with the power and accuracy as @entity70 - he can be utterly devastating , an incredible talent , and they know that			1
will it put them off taking the fight and vacating ? maybe			0
@entity83 will be thinking that they are taking on a guy who can beat their kid and also that they will have no future options on him			0
their alternative is to vacate , but that ’s a big step			0
@entity134 recently tweeted about @entity135 , but i ’m not sure that a fight between him and @entity73 makes sense for anyone just yet			1
my personal feeling is that the fight with @entity70 will happen - @entity73 is a fighter so he wo n’t want to vacate - and i hope by the end of this week to have an indication of the details			1
mandatory : @entity73 's ( right ) knock - out win over @entity74 ( left ) means he must take on @entity147 for his @entity76 title next challenge : after @entity73 's fourth round tko he must take on a challenger by july 19 or vacate i would love nothing more than for @entity70 to get this fight			1
he has had so many moments when for one reason or another his title shot has been cancelled			2
this will be his big fight and he will finally get the world title he has deserved for so long			1
it will be a very tough fight and i ’m very confident he will win			0
people think @entity70 wo n’t want the fight – no chance			1
he is already hard in camp having spent the last few weeks up the mountain in @entity166 in @entity167			0
@entity73 looked brilliant in his last fight , he has never been renowned as concussive puncher and many of his knockouts came against quite weak opposition early in his career			1
@entity74 is obviously a top - level fighter , but how much did he have left in that fight ? i also remember @entity73 drawing against @entity176 , who is quite poor to be honest			1
so yes , the @entity9 might want to make @entity70 an underdog			2
but that is a huge mistake			0
i have spoken to the @entity180 and we are hoping to meet next week to start discussions for an enormous fight between @entity184 and @entity185			1
i 've talked about how i think the lack of interest in @entity3 's forthcoming fight with @entity15 proves that people have got bored and frustrated of waiting for that @entity16 meeting , and we will not make that mistake with @entity184 and @entity185 , the @entity192 super-bantamweight world champion who i promote			1
@entity184 ’s camp have been calling me out on @entity194 , saying talk is cheap			1
no time wasting : @entity184 ( left ) versus @entity185 ( right ) is a fight that should n't be delayed well , i am the one who really wants to move this thing on and i am the one who has made the offers			1
i want @entity185 and @entity184 to fight each other next			1
i have made substantial offers in the past			0
and i am not asking for any future options on @entity205 – i said that in my last column			0
let ’s just make the world title fight that everyone wants to see			1
i will have a rematch clause in place but that is no penalty			0
if @entity184 can beat @entity185 like he thinks he can , then let ’s have a rematch in @entity216 and it will be another huge payday for everyone			1
i do n’t see the downside of a rematch clause			0
the champ : @entity185 defended his @entity192 @entity223 title knocking out @entity224 bring it on : @entity185 's camp wants the next fight to be against @entity184 , no more waiting around every time both guys fight , they look impressive			1
whenever @entity184 fights , everyone says , ‘ wow , he would beat @entity232 ’			2
when @entity185 fights , everyone says , ‘ wow , he would beat @entity234 ’			2
these are two warriors at the top of their game			0
let ’s not have any of this rubbish we have seen with @entity3 and @entity16			1
let ’s get this fight on			2
we are talking to @entity83 about @entity244 and we are also talking to @entity246 ’s people			0
those are two unification fights			0
and the public want it , too			0
@entity24 is also fighting against @entity250 this weekend and i think there could be trouble			0
it ’s likely that he has been promised internally that this will be a springboard to @entity3 , but i worry about @entity24 here			2
i always worry about him at elite level and this fight especially			0
@entity25 is not the greatest in this division , but he is long in the tooth , a southpaw , dangerous and active			0
@entity24 is not active – he has not fought in a year and has fought only twice since summer 2012			0
i ca n’t see how you go into a fight like this after such an absence			0
it ’s a massive risk			0
big time : @entity24 working out at @entity267 in @entity167 ahead of his @entity39 bout with @entity250 risk : @entity25 could be a stepping stone to @entity3 but is dangerous , as shown against @entity271 i have to mention @entity272			1
his win against @entity274 for the @entity276 intercontinental lightweight title was brutal and brilliant			0
he took his time , soaked up some punishment off a very good fighter and stopped him late on			0
in my opinion , he deserves a world title shot and i will deliver it as well			1
i am now in talks with the representatives of @entity285 , the @entity192 world champion , and i expect to make that fight this summer			1
that will be a huge night in @entity288			0
punishment : @entity272 lands a heavy left on @entity274 in his impressive victory ready for his shot : @entity272 fought smart and deserves a tilt at a world title , which he should get @entity272 is one of the nicest blokes you will meet in boxing , but he is also extremely determined and extremely talented			1
he lost in @entity298 not so long ago and look at him now			0
the arrival of his son recently has sharpened his mind and i would say he is not only ready for a title shot but also to win the belt			2
special credit to @entity306 who despite criticism in the build up to that fight works tirelessly for his fighters and constructed the perfect game plans for @entity272 and @entity185			1
it is a new era for @entity313 as we will be holding our first show at the @entity316 in @entity317 on may 21			0
we have been looking for an excuse to go to the arena and now we have one in the talented featherweight @entity320 , who is fresh off an impressive win over @entity322			0
he will defend his commonwealth title against @entity325 while @entity326 is in the fight of his life against @entity331 silver champion @entity329 in an official @entity333 title eliminator			2
arena - worthy : @entity320 's bout against @entity325 gives @entity313 an excuse to fill @entity316 in @entity317			0

fans want @entity3 to take on @entity16 , not @entity338
falling pay - per - view figures show fans are getting bored with him
@entity70 could face @entity73 for world title in @entity89 on july 12
talks have *reopened* for *blockbuster* @entity185 and @entity184 fight
@entity272 could soon get a shot at @entity285 ’s world title
