by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:11 pm on 6th january 2012 @entity2 vowed today to maintain the best - equipped military in history , despite dramatic defence cuts which top @entity7 leaders admit will increase the risks to the @entity9 ' our military will be leaner , but the world must know the @entity9 is going to maintain our military superiority , ' mr @entity2 said in a rare appearance in the @entity7 briefing room			1
defense secretary @entity16 and several top military brass lined up on the stage behind him , underscoring @entity7 support for cuts that mr @entity16 and others said they know will be criticised as too drastic			2
the strategy will ditch traditional ' @entity24 - era systems ' and concentrate instead on unmanned drones and electronic cyberwarfare			1
both ways : @entity9 president @entity2 vowed to strengthen military presence in the @entity29 despite fiscal constraints that expect to cut $ 662 billion from the country 's defense budget next year mr @entity2 said the emerging strategy overhaul is designed to contend with hundreds of billions of dollars in budget cuts and refocus the @entity9 ' national security priorities after a decade dominated by the post- 9/11 wars in @entity37 and @entity38			1
the strategy , devised through a comprehensive review by civilian and military leaders , centered on the military the country needs after the ' long wars of the last decade are over , ' mr @entity2 said			1
the cuts may make it impossible for the @entity9 to wage two full - scale wars at the same time , as they have done in recent years			1
mr @entity16 said that smaller military budgets will mean some tradeoffs and that the @entity9 will take on ' some level of additional but acceptable risk			1
' but mr @entity16 said that at this point in history , in a changing world , the @entity7 would have been forced to make a strategy shift anyway			2
he says the money crisis merely forced the government 's hand			2
more cuts : while the @entity9 is said to take on some additional risk due to its planned defense budget cuts , an additional $ 500 billion in cuts may be required in january of 2013 the president announced that the military will be reshaped over time with an emphasis on countering terrorism , maintaining a nuclear deterrent , protecting the @entity9 homeland , and ' deterring and defeating aggression by any potential adversary			1
' those are not new military missions , and mr @entity2 announced no new capabilities or defence initiatives			0
he described a @entity9 force that will retain much of its recent focus , with the exception of fighting a large - scale , prolonged conflict like the newly ended @entity38 mission or the ongoing war in @entity37			1
' as we end today 's wars and reshape our armed forces , we will ensure that our military is agile , flexible and ready for the full range of contingencies , ' the president wrote in a preamble to the new strategy , entitled , ' sustaining @entity9 global leadership : priorities for @entity93			1
' the strategy hints at a reduced @entity9 military presence in @entity96 , notwithstanding a continuing close relationship with @entity98 , and says @entity29 will be a bigger priority			1
it also emphasises improving @entity9 capabilities in the areas of cyberwarfare and missile defence			1
mr @entity2 said : ' we ’ll be able to ensure our security with smaller conventional ground forces			0
' we ’ll continue to get rid of outdated @entity24 - era systems so that we can invest in the capabilities we need for the future			0
' inevitable : defense secretary @entity16 says the change to the defense budget and handling was inevitable and that the money crisis merely forced the government 's hand mr @entity2 's decision to announce the strategy himself underscores the political dimension of @entity121 's debate over defence cuts			2
the administration says smaller @entity7 budgets are a must but will not come at the cost of sapping the strength of a military in transition , even as it gets smaller			0
in a presidential election year , the strategy gives mr @entity2 a rhetorical tool to defend his @entity7 budget - cutting choices			2
@entity135 contenders for the @entity136 already have criticised him on a wide range of national security issues , including missile defence , @entity140 and planned reductions in ground forces			0
mr @entity2 also wants the new strategy to represent a pivotal point in his stewardship of defence policy , which has been burdened throughout his presidency by the wars he inherited and the drag these conflicts have placed on military resources			1
difference : next year 's defense budget is planned to be $ 43 billion less than congress gave the @entity7 last year the new strategy moves the @entity9 further from its longstanding goal of being able to successfully fight two major regional wars — like the @entity157 to evict @entity38 forces from @entity159 or a theoretical ground war in @entity161 — at the same time			1
the document released thursday made clear that while some current missions of the military will be curtailed , none will be scrapped entirely			0
' wholesale divestment of the capability to conduct any mission would be unwise , based on historical and projected uses of @entity9 military forces and our inability to predict the future , ' the document said			1
the administration and @entity176 already are slashing projected defence spending to reflect the closeout of the @entity38 war and the drawdown in @entity37			0
the $ 662billion defence budget planned for next year is $ 27billion less than mr @entity2 wanted and $ 43 billion less than @entity176 gave the @entity7 this year			0
the @entity7 announced no specifics on the size of expected troop reductions ; the @entity185 and @entity186 already are set to shrink beginning in 2015			0
the document said the @entity7 will have to find savings in pay and health care benefits for members of the military , but it offered no specifics			0
mr @entity16 in recent months had previewed the main themes of the strategy by emphasizing a need to continue pressuring @entity197 and paying more attention to @entity200 security challenges , including @entity201 and @entity161			2
factors guiding the mr @entity2 administration 's approach to reducing the defense budget are not limited to war - fighting strategy			2
they also include judgments about how to contain the growing cost of military pay and health and retirement benefits			0
the administration is expected to form a commission to study the issue of retirement benefits , possibly led by a prominent retired military officer			0
the administration is in the final stages of deciding specific cuts in the 2013 budget , which mr @entity2 will submit to @entity176 next month			0
the strategy to be announced by mr @entity16 and @entity9 army general @entity222 , chairman of the @entity223 , is meant to accommodate about $ 489billion in defense cuts over the coming 10 years , as called for in a budget deal with @entity176 last summer			1
an additional $ 500billion in cuts may be required starting in january 2013			0
a prominent theme of the @entity7 's new strategy is what mr @entity16 has called a renewed commitment to security in the @entity29			2
the administration is not anticipating military conflict in @entity29 , but mr @entity16 believes the @entity9 got so bogged down in @entity38 and @entity37 after 9/11 that it missed chances to improve its strategic position in other regions			1
@entity201 is a particular worry because of its economic dynamism and rapid defense buildup			0
a more immediate concern is @entity140 , not only for its threats to disrupt the flow of international oil but also for its nuclear ambitions .			0

new strategy to focus on drones and cyberwarfare
@entity9 may no longer be able to wage two wars at once
