by @entity0 and @entity1 as the @entity3 basks in a heatwave , a charity has found a way to put the sweat caused by the enjoyable results of the hot summer weather to good use - by turning it into clean , drinkable water			2
@entity12 has created the @entity13 that squeezes the sweat from people 's clothes and then purifies the liquid to create drinking water			1
it was developed and built as part of @entity12 @entity21 's campaign to raise awareness of the lack of clean water in many parts of the world			1
children 's charity @entity12 has created the @entity13 ( pictured ) that squeezes sweat from people 's clothes , filters it and turns it into purified drinking water charity staff unveiled the machine during the opening of the the world ’s biggest international youth football tournament , the @entity35			1

per @entity85 of @entity21 , said : ' we wanted to raise this subject in a new , playful and engaging way			0
' our sweat machine is a reminder that we all share the same water			0
we all drink and sweat in the same way , regardless of how we look or what language we speak			0
' water is everyone 's responsibility and should be everyone ’s concern			0
' the concept was dreamed up by the charity , the @entity35 , creative agency @entity101 and celebrity engineer @entity102 , but the machine has its limitations			0
