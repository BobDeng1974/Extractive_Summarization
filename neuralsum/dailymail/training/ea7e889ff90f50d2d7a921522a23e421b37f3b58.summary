by @entity0 women should be feminine , greet their husbands with a smile at the door after work and ask them what they want for dinner , a social commentator has claimed - sparking a bemused reaction from two female today show hosts			1
@entity12 author @entity11 - also known as the @entity11 - dished out her tips for a happy marriage to women across @entity16 on thursday , also prompting an angry response on social media			1
' men have been so trained … in ways to be sensitive to women 's needs , ' she told today hosts @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
' ' i ’m just suggesting that it ’s wise for the marriage that – for the sake of the family – for women to be sensitive to their husbands as well			2
' ' there ’s nothing wrong with a woman saying to husband : " honey , would you like a drink , what would you like for dinner , what can i do for you now ? " ' the comments sparked hilarious reactions from @entity24 and @entity25 - who is dating co-host @entity23 's brother @entity54 - who both grimaced and shook their heads			1
' i feel like you ’re suggesting that we should be waiting on them , ' @entity24 said after @entity59 added that women should ' be nice ' to their husbands and ' greet them with a smile ' at the door when they come home from work			1
@entity25 looked bemused by what today show guest @entity11 was saying @entity23 cheekily agreed with his guest 's advice - not so @entity24 , who said it was ' archaic ' @entity59 says women should conform to traditional gender roles - a view clearly not shared by @entity25 ' most men who are the primary bread winners in their household , i think they ’re entitled to respect when they walk in the door , i think they ’re entitled to courtesy , appreciation , ' @entity59 continued			1
' i do n’t think there ’s anything wrong with that			2
it ’s a very politically incorrect thing to say			0
that necessarily does n’t make it incorrect			0
' @entity83 was one of the people who hit out at @entity11 's comments @ scouse_roar agreed with @ @entity83 who tweeted it was ' horribly offensive ' but some defended @entity59 's comments like @ @entity91 but @entity16 's lovable larrikin , @entity23 , was eating up the preachings of @entity59 - getting a kick out of his female counterparts ' reactions and saying he was a fan of her work			1
' i concur with a lot of your research , ' he said			0
' i think you ’re one of the wisest women in the world but convincing young women - or women of any age for that matter - that this is the right way of going is not an easy task because … i can hear them around @entity16 right now choking on their @entity112 , throwing things at the tv			2
' co-host @entity24 was equally unimpressed by @entity59 , saying : ' i feel like you 're suggesting that we should be waiting on them ' but her co-host @entity23 says he is a fan of @entity59 and she is ' one of the wisest women in the world ' @entity59 's comments also attracted strong opposition on social media			1
@ @entity83 tweeted : ' pardon me but f * * k [ sic ] off			0
i ’m an electrician and extremely proud of it			0
nothing feminine or traditional … '			2
and @ scouse_roar agreed : ' what a horribly offensive thing to say			0
' but like all issues , people were divided			0
' i do this everyday for my husband , just showing an interest in his day , its not archaic ! ! ' @ @entity91 wrote .			0
