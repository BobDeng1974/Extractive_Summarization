by @entity0 published : 21:59 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 11 june 2013 it has gone down in history as one of the most legendary student pranks of all time			0
a group of engineering students at @entity8 managed to get an @entity10 car on to a roof , baffling fellow students , faculty and police , in june 1958			1
until now , exactly how the car got onto the @entity15 70 feet up in the air has been a closely guarded secret - until today			1
original prank : the group of engineering students never revaled how they got the @entity10 on the roof of the @entity15 in 1958 exactly 55 years after the original prank was pulled off , a group of cadet officers managed to recreate the stunt at @entity23 , @entity24			1
a team from the @entity8 's @entity26 raised a similar @entity10 off the ground using ropes and a log structure			1
it took the group just ten minutes to lift the car 20 feet with a gyn - a three - legged frame with a rope and four pulleys which is used for hoisting loads vertically			2
the group had originally planned to fully recreate the joke using a 70 feet platform to represent the roof of @entity15 , but the idea had to be abandoned after it was deemed unsafe			1
heave ho : members of @entity43 hoist a car in the air in a bid to recreate the classic @entity48 prank of 1958 all tied up : the cadets tied up the car to a gyn , a method which has long been suspected to have been what the original pranksters used the engineering students behind the 1958 joke never fully explained how they got the car onto the roof , but has revealed in the past that it took several distractions , such as girls lifting their skirts , to get away with the prank undiscovered			1
after a week - long battle to hoist the @entity10 back down from the roof , police , firefighters and civil defence units were forced to give in and took the car to pieces with blowtorches			1
following this weekend 's recreation , staff sergeant @entity70 said : ‘ there were a few technical problems but in the end we got the car up in ten minutes			0
‘ we explained how it was done and had a lot of interest from intrigued people coming over to ask what was going on			0
’ @entity24 mayor councillor @entity82 , said : ‘ the re-enactment is a real tribute to an event that is now known as part of the mythology of @entity24			0
‘ it 's great that the @entity89 and the officer cadets came to hoist the car up as otherwise it would be impossible			2
@entity94 lift : after roping the car to the winch system , the officer cadet team members were able to get the car into the air in just ten minutes ‘ i would be quite horrified to see a similar stunt happen but i think we are more aware of the dangers now			2
‘ in the high spirits of the 50 's after the war it is understandable but we ca n't afford to damage any of our old buildings today			0
’ @entity107 , a committee member of @entity108 and @entity109 , said attempts were made to invite the original perpetrators of the prank			0
he said : ‘ we did try to get them to come along but they are now scattered across the country and are elderly			0
‘ it was a good little show and we had a great response			0

@entity8 prank saw @entity10 placed on a roof in 1958
original jokers never revealed how the car got on the @entity15
