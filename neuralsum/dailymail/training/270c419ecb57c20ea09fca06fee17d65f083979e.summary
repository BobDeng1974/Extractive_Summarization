@entity0 will one day sit down , take a deep breath and remember his remarkably long career at @entity3			1
but that will have to wait until he finally calls time on his reign			0
the 64 - year - old celebrates 18 years since he took over the north @entity8 club on wednesday , but insists he does not have time to look back over almost two decades there — especially with a crucial @entity12 group stage game against @entity13 marking his anniversary			1
he is one of the last of a dying breed of long - standing managers who were afforded time and patience to build an empire , watch it grow , nurture it , then start over again when it floundered			0
@entity0 celebrates 18 years as @entity3 manager on wednesday but is only looking forward for now @entity24 is the next longest - serving manager in the @entity25 having been in his job just four years @entity24 at @entity27 is the closest boss in the top flight to the @entity29 — with just four seasons at the helm — but his tenure is dangerously close to ending			1
@entity0 said : ‘ it ’s a great honour and privilege to be in charge of such a big club for such a long time , but i have no time to look back right now , i will do it at another time			1
' i never look back			0
what is always your target is to take the maximum potential out of the team			0
the @entity3 manager celebrates his 18th year in charge at @entity3 on wednesday			1
here are some of his key numbers : 1,021 games in charge at @entity3			2
he has won 590 , drawn 230 and lost 201			0
13 trophies won by @entity0 at @entity3 : three league titles , five @entity55 and five @entity56			1
1,880 @entity3 goals under @entity0 — an average of 1.84 per game			1
only sir @entity61 ( 1,752 ) has more			0
1st in 1998 , @entity0 became the first foreign manager to win the @entity64 league title			1
57.8 overall @entity3 win percentage			1
' the only thing i would say this season is that this team has huge potential and it has to come out			0
at the moment i am more worried about that			0
’ he added : ‘ for the rest , @entity12 evolution , maybe it was more open 15 years ago than it is today			2
the concentration of the big players in a small number of clubs is much more than it was before			0
‘ it ’s much more predictable , the outcome of the @entity12 , than it was 10 years ago			2
it ’s harder to win it			0
' if you make a poll tomorrow and say to people “ give me four clubs who will win the @entity12 ” , 80 or 90 per cent of people will say they are these four clubs			2
‘ i do n’t think that we are one of the four who will be favourites to win it , but football is strange and not always predictable			0
’ former @entity98 boss @entity97 watches over @entity13 training on the pitch at the @entity101 @entity102 and his teammates will be looking to inflict back - to - back defeats on @entity0 's side the competition winners may be predictable for the @entity29 , but he could not have envisaged the sound beating his side were given by @entity109 in their opening match			1
it was the first time in 11 years they had lost an opening group game in the competition			1
the last time , a wednesday night in 2003 , they were hammered 3 - 0 by @entity116 at home but still went on to top their group and reach the quarter - finals , where they were eliminated by @entity121			2
‘ one thing that has not changed compared to 18 years ago , the players were very intelligent and they are still very intelligent today , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ they know what is at stake			0
mathematically they know @entity13 is the game for us			2
’ back in 2003 - 04 , @entity0 ’s team became @entity129 as undefeated league champions , which he will surely fondly recall			0
@entity3 lost their first game of this year 's @entity12 , going down 2 - 0 to @entity109 it was the first time in 11 years that they lost on the opening day , and @entity0 has never lost his first two @entity134 is fit enough to make the @entity3 squad as they look to revive their @entity12 hopes but defeat at home to @entity13 will heap pressure on qualifying for the knockout stages and would bring a more painful memory to mind for @entity0 — who has never lost the opening two games in a @entity12 campaign			1
on wednesday , @entity0 will make a decision on whether to start @entity134 after he turned his ankle against @entity147			2
it was feared the midfielder would be out for a lengthy spell , but he came through training on tuesday , when he looked sharp			0
@entity153 , who has a hamstring injury , and @entity155 , struggling with a calf problem , also suffered significant problems in that match and will be out for at least three weeks			0
@entity158 is set to start in the absence of @entity160 , and @entity0 has tipped the injury - prone left back to become @entity163 ’s long - term replacement to @entity164			1
@entity169 trio @entity168 ( right ) , @entity165 ( centre ) and @entity167 ( left ) are all in the squad @entity0 believes @entity158 could be @entity163 's next left back , emulating former @entity3 man @entity164 indeed , national team manager @entity172 and his assistant @entity173 will be at the @entity101 tonight to monitor @entity158 , along with @entity3 ’s other @entity64 players			1
@entity0 revealed on tuesday that he only allowed @entity175 to leave for @entity176 in 2011 to give @entity158 a chance			1
‘ for a long time there was no discussion , it was @entity164 for @entity163			2
now it ’s a bit more open , ’ explained @entity0			0
‘ @entity158 has such great potential , if he lets it go			0
’ @entity0 nurtured the teenage @entity164 from a forward into one of the world ’s best full backs and similarly moved @entity158 back when he joined the club as a winger aged 16			1
asked if @entity158 , now 25 , can reach @entity164 ’s level , @entity0 replied : ‘ yes , it ’s a good example to follow			1
when it mattered and when you had to be there , he was always there			0
@entity158 ( left ) trains alongside teammates @entity197 and @entity165 before the @entity13 clash the young left - back has been superb so far this season for @entity3 and could be in line for an @entity163 call			1

@entity0 is longest serving @entity25 manager
