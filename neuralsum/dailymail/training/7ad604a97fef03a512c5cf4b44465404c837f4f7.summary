@entity0 died of a cardiac arrest after doctors failed to spot a major infection as five - year - old @entity0 lay dying , she asked her father one last heartbreaking question : ‘ why are you crying , @entity8 ? ’ the brave schoolgirl was suffering a cardiac arrest brought on by an illness that doctors failed to spot , an inquest heard			1
she had been sent home from hospital by medics who believed she simply had a virus			1
but two days later she was rushed back when her condition deteriorated rapidly			2
it turned out @entity0 was suffering from bronchial pneumonia and a major infection between her lungs and chest wall			1
as they prepared to move her to paediatric intensive care from a high dependency unit , they gave her medication to tackle the bacterial infection but the youngster suffered a cardiac arrest			1
but just moments before she died , @entity0 gave her crying father @entity36 a kiss and asked him why he was in tears			1
speaking about how their lives had been turned upside down by her death , her father and mother @entity38 said they never thought they would n't come home from the hospital without their daughter			1
the couple , who used to live in @entity49 , said : ' we were incredibly close to our daughter @entity0			0
' although she was only five years old , she cared for us , as much as we cared for her			0
' she loved her siblings and all of her friends at school			0
@entity0 loved going to school and she loved her teachers			0
' when she grew up she wanted to be a paediatrician - she even told the doctor at the hospital that was what she wanted to be			1
' after that first visit to the hospital , we thought she would be fine			0
even when we went back on 21 january 2013 , we did not expect to leave the hospital without our daughter			2
' @entity0 's death has affected our lives significantly : our family life , our studies , every day , even walking down the street			2
' we know that nothing can bring @entity0 back but we hope that knowledge of the circumstances in which @entity0 died , which we now understand in more detail , can prevent similar deaths in the future			2
' when she was first admitted , the little girl was examined and given an antihistamine drug before being sent home			0
and doctors at @entity82 , in @entity80 , told the family she would be well enough to mix with other children at school			2
this was despite being severe dehydration and she had not eaten or drunk for two days , @entity86 was told			0
she died in the early hours of january 22 after being readmitted and concerned staff had called in senior paediatric consultant dr @entity92			0
she suffered a cardiac arrest thought to have been brought on by a flood of toxins into her system and having suffered septic shock			1
lawyers representing the @entity0 family questioned if the little girl may have survived had she been admitted directly to intensive care rather than time being lost at the high dependency unit			2
an internal investigation carried out by the hospital revealed there had been failings in her care			1
however @entity107 , senior coroner for @entity80 , said it would never be known if her death could have been prevented by earlier treatment			1
an internal investigation at @entity82 , pictured , found there had been failings in the youngster 's care her devastated parents said their little girl had big dreams of becoming a paediatrician when she grew up			1
@entity0 even made the point of telling the doctors and nurses of her chosen career as they checked her over and treated her on admission to hospital the first time			1
her father added in a statement that on their first visit to @entity134 , he had been told by a first year trainee @entity134 specialist that she would recover within three days			2
he said : ' the doctor said it was a normal rash and not contagious			0
' she told me she would be okay to go back to school and be around other children			0
' recording a verdict of death by natural causes , mr @entity107 said the ' failure to recognise @entity0 's deteriorating condition ' caused ' a delay in the initial amount of immediate treatment '			1
he said : ' with the benefit of hindsight we now know there have been failings in individual decisions which , if they had been different , might have prevented the tragic outcome in this case			0
' her additional infection in the child 's lung lining , which clinicians were unaware of at the time , may have been ' highly - relevant ' to her sudden , rapid deterioration , he added			0
mr @entity107 said : ' the central issue in this case is whether it would have made any difference if her true medical condition had been recognised sooner			0
' it may well have been different if she had been moved to the paediatric intensive care unit and she was treated sooner , but i do n't know that - and i do n't believe that we 'll ever know			0
' the inquest heard how an internal investigation carried out by @entity82 into @entity0 's death concluded that there had been failings			1
it said doctors had not appreciated the gravity of her condition in the final hours of her life , the court was told			0
giving evidence , paediatric consultant dr @entity187 was asked if she would have already contracted pneumonia three days before her death on her first hospital visit			2
he admitted it was not known and said : ' it could have been present at the time , but it could also have not been present until 24 hours later			0
' dr @entity187 added that since @entity0 's death there had been briefings across the @entity201 region and there was now increased awareness of how to manage @entity204 in children when they were hospitalised			2
@entity206 , patient safety manager at @entity82 , added : ' our thoughts and sympathies remain with @entity0 's family at what continues to be a very difficult time for them			1
' as reported at the inquest hearing , @entity0 was assessed appropriately in our emergency department and the circumstances surrounding her death , although extremely sad and distressing , could not have been predicted			1
' we hope the coroner 's determination will help to give the family a better understanding of the difficulties her condition presented and we offer them our full support as they continue to come to terms with their loss			0
