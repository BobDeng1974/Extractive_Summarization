by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 13:35 est , 25 october 2012 a holiday cottage called ' best view in @entity3 ' is the latest beauty spot at risk of being blighted by a wind turbine			1
the property near @entity8 , @entity9 , was christened after its uninterrupted panorama on the edge of the @entity12			2
but plans for a 40metre wind turbine to be built just 300 metres away could soon prompt a name change			1
best view in @entity3 : a holiday cottage overlooking the @entity9 countryside may have its view blighted by a wind turbine @entity20 : the owners boast of sunsets like the @entity23 , but are worried business will be spoilt by the eyesore owner @entity26 says the planning application , if successful , will damage her business as well as the view			1
she is among dozens of residents who have joined @entity32 in opposing the plan for a wind turbine on @entity35			1
the @entity35 fightback is just one of many battles being waged by local campaigners up and down the country , and comes days after @entity42 tourism chiefs warned that wind farms could drive holidaymakers away			2
submitted by local farmer @entity46 , the @entity35 turbine is aimed at cutting power costs and providing clean energy			1
objectors claim it will be unsightly and noisy			1
but , like so many others , they find current planning law , with its presumption in favour of renewable energy schemes , stacked against them			0
the law states that the adverse effects of a turbine can be proved to ‘ significantly and demonstrably ’ outweigh its supposed carbon - reduction benefits , then the application may approved regardless of how strongly the local community objects			2
plans under consideration could leave the cottage ( circled ) sandwiched between a communications tower ( left ) and a 40metre wind turbine ( in red ) mrs @entity26 , who lives at @entity68 , where the cottage is based , has run the business for three years			1
she said : ' i run a holiday let called @entity73 in @entity3 - it ’s clearly not going to be that anymore , not with a wind turbine in the way			1
' it will ruin our beautiful open views			0
' if the turbine is built , her farm will be sandwiched between it and @entity84 - a reinforced concrete telecommunications mast owned by @entity86 which will be powered by the turbine			0
mrs @entity26 added : ' they say they ca n’t put the turbine within a 300 metre radius of the tower because of the electromagnetic interference , but they are happy to put it within 300 metres of us			0
' on a national scale , concerns have been raised over the health impact of living near a wind turbine , with those affected claiming to suffer from dizziness , increased blood pressure , and depression			2
mr @entity46 says the electricity will be sold to @entity86 or put back in the @entity106 , and the development is part of ongoing efforts to improve energy efficiency and sustainability			0
fightback : @entity113 have vowed to oppose the application , made by a local farmer warning : tourism chiefs in @entity42 say wind farms may be putting holidaymakers off he said : ' we have been researching and discussing , exhaustively , the possibilities of generating our own electricity for nearly four years			2
' it emerged earlier this month that energy suppliers were paid over £ 34million over 12 months to switch turbines off in high winds			0
the arrangement compensates them for the @entity106 's inability to cope with the extra energy produced during high winds			0
nevertheless , up to 32,000 wind turbines could be built in @entity133 and @entity134 over the next 40 years to meet carbon reduction targets			0
many of the existing sites are owned by foreign firms which have made record profits in recent years .			0
