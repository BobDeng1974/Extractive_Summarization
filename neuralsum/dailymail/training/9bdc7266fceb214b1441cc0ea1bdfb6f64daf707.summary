@entity0 is a fashion subculture from @entity2 , influenced by clothing from the @entity5 and @entity6 eras the style has no association with the book @entity0 by @entity10 the @entity2 fashion subculture @entity0 has made its way to @entity13 , and the trend appears to be a hit			1
the trend @entity0 is often associated with @entity19 's novel by the same name , referred to as cute , ' nymphet ' - inspired styles in high fashion magazines			1
however the @entity0 style is influenced by clothing from the grand , but demure , @entity5 and @entity6 eras , its roots lying in modesty rather than promiscuity			1
pretty in pastels : members of the @entity33 club share a moment together in a park in @entity36 its basic style consists of a buttoned up blouse , petticoat , bloomers , bell - shaped skirt , knee - high socks , and heavy make - up with an influence from @entity2 's @entity47 media			2
members of the @entity33 club in @entity36 are turning what was once a sporadic and limited style outside of @entity2 into a prominent fixture in @entity51			2
a member of @entity33 club said : ' the goal of @entity0 is not to create a sexy image but rather to maintain a cute or elegant appeal			0

sweet frills : @entity64 , 25 , poses in front of a mirror in her bedroom bows and pearls : a member of the @entity33 club adjusts her headband members of the @entity33 club walk together in @entity36 - its basic style consists of a blouse , petticoat , bloomers , bell - shaped skirt and knee - high socks street style : miss @entity64 walks to the supermarket in @entity36 @entity80 , a 24 - year - old @entity0 reinforced this idea : ' it ’s not , as some commentators have suggested , some sort of appeal to men ’s expectation that women should be childlike , or an attempt to pander to pedophiles			2
' pedophiles like little girls			0
they do n’t like grown women who happen to like dresses with cakes on them			0
i ’ve never been hit on by a pedophile while in @entity0			0
we do n’t get into it because it is some sort of misplaced pedo complex or anything , and the objective is n’t simply to emulate little girls , despite the name @entity0 , ' she explained to @entity107			0

major @entity2 brands , like the @entity152 , @entity150 , @entity151 , and @entity149 started shipping @entity0 products and goods to the international marketplace three years ago			1
however , with the demand increasing , many @entity158 designers are producing their own @entity0 style and range of clothing , enabling pockets of the sub-culture to flourish outside of @entity2 .			1
