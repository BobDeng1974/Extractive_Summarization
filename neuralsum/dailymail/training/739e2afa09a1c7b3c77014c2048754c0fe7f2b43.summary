treasury minister @entity0 said there should be a new offence of ' corporate failure to avoid preventing an economic crime ' firms which give advice on how to avoid tax will be treated as harshly as tax dodgers themselves under a new law set out by the @entity11 today			1
treasury minister @entity0 said there should be a new offence of ' corporate failure to avoid preventing an economic crime '			1
he likened the new law to prosecuting someone who acts as an accomplice to a burglar breaking into homes			2
the @entity11 set out details of the new laws , which they say will form part of their manifesto if they can not be put on to the statue book by the coalition before the election			2
the centrepiece would be a new offence of a corporate failure to prevent economic crime , including aiding or facilitating tax evasion			1
there would also be a penalty for those that facilitate others to commit tax evasion , so they face the same financial penalty as that repaid in tax and fines by the evader themselves			1
codes of practice that apply to tax advisers would also be toughened to make it harder to help people and businesses to avoid tax			0
mr @entity0 said the idea would also see organisations who encourage tax evasion or make it easier for it to be carried out face the same level of fine as the evaders			1
speaking on the @entity61 on @entity62 , mr @entity0 said the idea would create a much stronger deterrent to companies helping tax dodgers			1
he said : ' organisations , be they accountants , banks or whatever , who help people evade tax will be liable for this new offence and crucially liable for financial penalties			2
' so , for example , if their customers have to pay back hundreds of millions of pounds in tax then those organisations should have to match that with hundreds of millions of pounds of their own money and i think that 's a very tough disincentive to them to get involved in this in the first place			2
this is something that absolutely must n't happen in our society and we still have a problem with some people thinking they can get away without paying their fair share of tax			0
' mr @entity0 went on : ' this is a @entity11 idea for our manifesto			1
we 've delivered a lot from our last manifesto tackling avoidance , tackling evasion			0
' but i am going to seek to pursue this within @entity101 over the next few weeks because i think we do have time potentially in the @entity103 or through other processes that are going through to take these ideas forward			0
' but what i can say is if it we 're not able to do that then we absolutely will be making this one of our key things in the general election			0
' the @entity11 say their plan also includes making a commitment for the government to see the ' tax gap ' - the difference between the total tax owed to the @entity117 and the amount actually collected - fall in each year of the next parliament			1
mr @entity0 said he wanted to make tax evasion as socially unacceptable as benefit fiddling or drinking and driving in a statement , mr @entity0 added : ' these new measures will build on the successful strategy that is making tax evasion as socially unacceptable as benefit fiddling or drinking and driving			1
' it is a crime , plain and simple			0
if someone helps a break into your home they end up in the dock as an accomplice			2
it should be the same if some helps a tax evader			0
' for @entity141 , @entity140 said nobody will believe mr @entity0 's ' warm words ' as the @entity11 have ' broken their promises on tax '			1
the shadow chief secretary to the treasury said : ' along with the @entity148 , they have totally failed to tackle tax avoidance and cut taxes for millionaires while raising vat on families and pensioners			0
' the amount of uncollected tax has gone up by Â£ 3 billion under @entity0 and @entity157			2
' this government has refused to close loopholes which @entity141 has highlighted			0
and ministers still need to explain why there has been just one prosecution out of 1,100 names in the @entity165 case and why the head of the bank was made a @entity148 minister			0
' mr @entity140 added @entity141 would have an immediate ' root and branch ' review of @entity172 to ensure it is ' up to the job '			0

@entity11 *announce* offence of corporate failure to prevent economic crime
it includes aiding or facilitating tax evasion and would hit advice firms
@entity0 likens crime to a burglar 's accomplice who helps break - in
