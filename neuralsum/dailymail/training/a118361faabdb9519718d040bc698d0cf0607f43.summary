by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 06:47 est , 11 july 2013 we knew things were bad			0
we knew that @entity3 are in danger of failing to qualify for the @entity5			0
we knew that the @entity3 under - 21s failed to progress out of the group stages at the @entity8 in @entity9 this summer – losing all three games and scoring just one goal			2
we knew that the @entity3 under - 20s flopped at the @entity5 in @entity13 – failing to win a single game before exiting at the group stages			2
@entity3 have not won a match at an under - 20 @entity5 for sixteen years now – when @entity17 and @entity18 were in the team in 1997			0
farce : @entity3 are in danger of not qualifying for the @entity5 with @entity22 and @entity23 ( below ) but a calamitous summer for @entity26 football continues to get worse , as this @entity28 study reveals the frightening lack of confidence that @entity32 clubs are showing in @entity26 talent in comparison to their rival leagues on the continent			1
@entity32 clubs have signed a total of sixty players in this summer transfer window and just nine – a measly 15 % - of those transfers have been for @entity26 players			1
by comparison , top - flight sides in @entity44 have signed a total of eighty players so far this window and forty - three ( 53.75 % ) of these acquisitions have been for @entity50 players			1
it makes for a far greater pool for national team manager @entity53 to choose from - and such strength in depth has allowed @entity44 to send strong squads to the under - 21 @entity8 and the under - 20 @entity5 this summer			1
it also allows young players to gain vital tournament experience - @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 immediately spring to mind as players who would undoubtedly have been rushed into the first - team setup with @entity3			2
failing youth : the @entity67 side had an appalling euros , with @entity69 and @entity70 ( below ) instead , they were able to take responsibility as the key figures in the youth team - with all three excellent as @entity44 coasted to success at the under - 21 @entity8 in @entity9			1
equally , eighteen of the twenty clubs in @entity77 have already brought in a @entity50 player this summer – compared to just six clubs purchasing an @entity26 player in the @entity32			1
of greater concern is the fact that the sides who finished in the top eight of the @entity32 last season – @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 – have all failed to sign a single @entity26 player between them this summer			1
even amongst the nine @entity26 players who have been signed – two by @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , one by @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 – the majority of these players will be severely limited in their playing time next season			1
from foreign shores : @entity89 snapped up @entity109 from @entity111 side @entity110 big money : @entity88 splashed the cash on @entity115 midfielder @entity114 flying the flag : @entity91 ' big signing so far has been @entity119 midfielder @entity118 , who starred in the @entity120 it is quite the @entity122 crew			2
@entity123 will be a third choice goalkeeper at @entity102			0
@entity124 and @entity125 , both 19 , will be toiling away in the reserves at @entity105 and @entity100 after signing from non-league @entity127 and @entity128 respectively			0
@entity129 , now 28 , is in last chance saloon territory in terms of forging a @entity32 career after signing for @entity104 from @entity133			0
only the signings of @entity135 by @entity103 , @entity136 by @entity102 and @entity137 by @entity101 provoke genuine excitement of the promise that could be fulfilled with regular first - team football in the @entity32			2
@entity141 is the star name on the list – but his permanent move to @entity100 has long been anticipated after a season - long loan spell at @entity146 during the last campaign			0
the figures reveal a major problem that is threatening to stifle opportunites for @entity26 players for generations to come			1
while just 30 % of @entity32 clubs have invested in @entity26 players this summer , the story could not be more different on the continent			1
headlines : but @entity157 spent a season with @entity100 before his switch from @entity93 was confirmed @entity160 : @entity137 's move from @entity162 to @entity32 new boys @entity101 is almost unique in @entity111 , seventeen of the eighteen @entity166 sides have signed at least one @entity111 player in this window , while 41 of the 84 players ( 49 % ) signed would qualify to play for the @entity111 national team			1
@entity172 and @entity173 1 sides are demonstrating a similar commitment			0
seventeen of the twenty sides in both leagues have already signed an @entity178 - in the case of @entity172 - or a @entity180 - in the case of @entity182 - ahead of the new season			2
a new @entity185 chairman , @entity184 , arrives into the job this weekend to succeed @entity187 and it is easy for ourselves to sit here and demand action			0
the @entity3 national team is the responsibility of the @entity185 and the body must attempt to protect the future for @entity26 players			1
different thinking : @entity61 would have been rushed into the @entity3 national side ‘ quota ’ is a speculative , scare word and besides , any attempts to introduce more stringent regulations - say , for example , that all @entity32 clubs must field at least six @entity26 players in any one game - may be derailed by @entity204			1
the uncomfortable truth is that the @entity32 , as a global phenomenon , has now superseded the @entity185			0
since the breakaway from the @entity211 in 1992 , the @entity185 ’s stagnation and structural paralysis has allowed the @entity32 to become the dominant authority of @entity26 football			2
poisoned chalice : @entity184 officially takes charge at the @entity185 this weekend , succeeding @entity187 with every record - breaking broadcasting deal agreed , the clout of the @entity32 and its member clubs increases			2
while they set about organising initiatives and securing business , the @entity185 is left to operate in the highly charged arenas of maintaining discipline and attempting to balance the needs of the professional game with the eternal challenges presented at grassroots level			0
the development of @entity26 players is left in the hands of @entity32 clubs			1
but they can no longer be entrusted			0
the leading clubs increasingly stock their academies with teenagers from overseas , while managers are constantly scouring the foreign market for the finest global talent			0
and as the @entity32 enters the new campaign with a more cosmopolitan look than ever before , @entity26 football fans do so with the inescapable fear that the structure of the national team now finds itself in an irreparable state			1
total number of signings by @entity32 clubs : 60 total number of @entity26 players signed by @entity32 clubs : 9 ( 15 % ) total number of @entity251 players signed by @entity32 clubs : 12 ( 20 % ) total number of @entity253 players signed by @entity32 clubs : 3 ( 5 % ) total number of @entity256 / @entity255 / @entity258 players signed by @entity32 clubs : 0 ( 0 % ) total number of @entity26 or even @entity251 players signed by the top eight from last season ’s @entity32 – @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 – 0 number of @entity32 clubs to have signed @entity26 players already this summer : 6 out of 20 = 30 % @entity135 - £ 5.5 million deal from @entity93 to @entity103 @entity157 - £ 17million deal from @entity93 to @entity100 @entity125 – undisclosed but very small fee for deal from @entity128 to @entity100			1
