@entity0 was left to bemoan a series of penalty decisions which went against @entity3 as they were held to a 0 - 0 @entity5 quarter - final draw by @entity6			1
the @entity8 boss felt his side could have been awarded two spot - kicks in a keenly - contested tie at @entity12 in which the @entity14 side defended tigerishly to secure a replay at @entity16			1
@entity0 told @entity17 after the game : ' they defended very , very well and when you have that many bodies behind the ball - and they were very brave , got blocks in - and i thought we should have had a penalty			1
@entity0 looks on frustrated during @entity3 's goalless clash with @entity6 on sunday @entity0 ( middle ) and counterpart @entity29 greet the crowd ahead of the @entity5 clash at @entity12 the @entity8 boss had cause for concern after defender @entity33 was taken off on a stretcher early on @entity35 ( left ) hit the back of the net for the @entity8 in the first half but his strike was ruled out for offside ' in games like this sometimes in that opening 20 minutes , if you can get the first goal , it opens the game up			1
' @entity48 's one looked a clear penalty			2
the defender is recovering back in , but he 's on the wrong side and he ca n't get to the ball , so for me , that was a penalty			1
' you could argue when [ @entity58 ] @entity57 handballs it off the header from the free - kick , we could have had another penalty , and sometimes you need that little bit of luck			1
' they have got some good players - @entity67 gives you a problem up front - but i thought in the main , we dealt with that really , really well			2
' i thought maybe the sharpness was just missing from our game and that wee bit of incision			0
but credit to the players , they kept a clean sheet and the objective was to be in the hat for the next round by the end of the evening , and that 's what we are in			0
' @entity82 ( centre ) made a superb save to tip an @entity85 header away in the second half @entity6 defender @entity87 ( left ) insists @entity3 did not deserve a penalty for this challenge on @entity8 striker @entity90 during the second half @entity3 attacker @entity48 ( right ) was also denied a penalty after tumbling from a challenge by @entity87 @entity93 did not play due to injury , but fans are desperate to get to @entity96 in his final season at the club rovers skipper @entity87 was quick to insist the home side did not deserve a penalty for his challenge on dangerman @entity90			1
he said : ' no , no , no , no. you have got to be tight to him			0
you give him a yard and he 's got that shot with no back - lift			0
maybe when i did give him that yard , he has got the shot off			0
' you have got to be tight to these players and that 's what i was			0
' things might have been worse for @entity3 had it not been for a fine 49th - minute save by keeper @entity82 to claw @entity85 's header out of the top corner			2
@entity85 said : ' i was free at the corner			0
they mark zonally and i thought it was in , to be honest			0
