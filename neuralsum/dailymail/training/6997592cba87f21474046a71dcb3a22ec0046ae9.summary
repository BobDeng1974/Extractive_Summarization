by @entity0 @entity1 or not ? the younger @entity2 is seen in a vault in @entity4 near @entity5 experts appeared confident yesterday when they unveiled a younger version of the @entity2 , claiming they could prove the painting was an original @entity1 , portraying perhaps the most - famous smile in humanity in her younger years			1
the @entity13 - based @entity12 unveiled what is known as the ' @entity15 ' to the public , and said mathematical analysis proved it was the hand of the master at work here			1
but other experts remain unconvinced , with @entity22 professor @entity21 telling the @entity23 there is ' no basis for thinking that there was an earlier portrait '			1
he said : ' the @entity15 mistranslates subtle details of the original , including the sitter ’s veil , her hair , the translucent layer of her dress , the structure of the hands			1
' the landscape is devoid of atmospheric subtlety			2
the head , like all other copies , does not capture the profound elusiveness of the original			2
' the scientific analysis can at most state that there is nothing to say that this can not be by @entity1			2
the infrared reflectography and x-ray points very strongly to its not being by @entity1			2
' the @entity50 begs to differ			2
' so far , not one scientific test has been able to disprove that the painting is by @entity1 , ' said art historian @entity53			1
' we have used methods that were not available to @entity1 500 years ago			2
' when we do a very elementary mathematical test , we have discovered that all of the elements of the two bodies - the two people , the two sitters - are in exactly the same place			0
it strikes us that in order for that to be so accurate , so meticulously exact , only the person who did one did the other ... it 's an extraordinary revelation in itself , and we think it 's valid			0
the posture , folded hand positions , faces , expressions and clothing are similar , while the landscape in the background is different			0
the foundation says the painting turned up in the home of an @entity104 nobleman in the late 1800s - thus the connection to @entity85 - and was shipped to the @entity106 for safekeeping during @entity107 after the war , it was analysed in @entity110 , and eventually taken to @entity111 where it remained in a bank vault for the last 40 years , the group said			1
the @entity15 has been known publicly for generations - if forgotten by the broader public - and the book excerpts numerous news headlines about the painting and the possibility of its @entity1 connection in the early 20th century			1
hat do you think ? the @entity12 , a non-profit organisation based in @entity13 , offer ' historical , comparative and scientific evidence ' to back their claims world famous : the painting by @entity1 , pictured , has been imitated a thousand times , satirised , stolen and vandalised with acid , red paint , stones and even a teacup admiration : art fans look at the @entity2 painting by @entity1 , left , in the @entity92 museum in @entity134 the @entity135 is an alternative title for the @entity2 ; @entity2 is an abbreviation of ‘ @entity138 ’ , or my lady , while @entity135 is @entity110 for the jocund , or happy , one			1
the sitter ’s real name is in fact thought to be @entity145 , wife of a rich @entity147 silk merchant , @entity145			0
on @entity1 ’s death in 1519 , the picture — the @entity92 ’s version , that is — was left to his assistant , @entity151 , who in turn sold it to @entity154 of @entity155			1
the painting remained in the royal collection until the @entity158 in 1789 , when it was moved to the @entity92			1
there it has remained ever since , with a few notable absences			0
@entity163 kept it in his bedroom in the @entity166 and , during the @entity167 of 1870 - 1 , it was transferred for safekeeping to the @entity168 in @entity169			0
during @entity171 , it migrated all over @entity155 to avoid damage			0
it has also been on tour to @entity175 and @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178			0
but the picture ’s biggest excursion was in 1911 , when it was stolen by an @entity110 @entity92 worker , called @entity183 , who wanted it returned to @entity110			0
he pulled off the biggest art theft in history in the simplest way : hiding in a broom cupboard during the day , then slipping out after closing time , the @entity2 stuffed under his coat			0
he kept it in his flat for two years and was only discovered when he brazenly tried to flog the picture to the @entity193 in @entity147			0
that was n’t the end of @entity2 ’s troubles			0
in 1956 , the poor old girl was first scarred with acid , and then attacked with a rock			0
bulletproof glass protected it when , in 1974 , a disabled woman , protesting against the @entity92 ’s policy on handicapped visitors , threw red paint at the picture			0
the glass again saved the picture only three years ago , when an angry @entity209 woman , denied @entity155 citizenship , threw a teacup at the painting			1
meanwhile , the other supposed @entity2 gathered dust in a @entity111 bank vault , where it has rested for 40 years			1
after @entity218 ’s death , he left the picture to his girlfriend and , on her death , the @entity111 consortium bought it .			1

@entity111 consortium argue their version is his first stab at the painting
but other experts believe it is a later copy
