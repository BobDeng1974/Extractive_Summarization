an @entity1 entrepreneur who runs a successful coffee shop is being deported - because she did n't earn enough before launching the venture			1
@entity1 - born @entity4 , 27 , moved to @entity5 in 2011 and married barista husband @entity6 , of @entity7 , @entity8 , two years ago			1
they had just signed a five - year lease on a premises for their own coffee house when they received a bombshell letter from the @entity15			1
@entity1 - born @entity4 ( right ) and her husband @entity6 ( left ) set up a coffee shop in @entity7 , @entity8 - only to be told she must return to @entity18 within two weeks officials said she must be deported because the couple did not meet the minimum income threshold for sponsoring a @entity23 spouse to stay in the country			1
at the time they submitted their income , mr @entity6 was still studying philosophy at @entity28 so their combined salary fell below the £ 18,000 minimum			1
@entity4 now has just 14 days to return to @entity18 , shattering their dream of running their own business			1
a number of her customers , and two local mps , have now joined a campaign to stop her being deported			2
her distraught husband said : ' our whole world has been torn apart			2
our family and friends are here			0
' if we have to go we might try setting something up somewhere else , probably in @entity47 , maybe in @entity48			0
' @entity4 moved to @entity5 in 2011 and married barista husband @entity6 , of @entity7 , @entity8 , two years ago			1
they are pictured on their wedding day @entity4 moved to the @entity5 in 2011 and met her husband while she was working in a coffee shop in @entity54			1
they married two years later and returned to mr @entity6 's home in @entity7 , where they set up an artisan coffee business			1
but just days after the couple signed a five - year lease on @entity61 in july 2014 , @entity4 received the letter from the @entity15			1
they fell victim to a new law which came into affect in 2012 meaning someone in her position must have a household income of least £ 18,600 to stay in @entity5			1
she said : ' we wanted to come to @entity7 and set up a business like those in @entity54 , and really contribute to the area			1
' they seem to think that because we earn a little bit less than £ 18,000 , we 'll start claiming benefits			2
the pair had just signed a five - year lease for their own coffee house when they received a bombshell letter from the @entity15 ' we were told we could n't possibly live on that much money , but we 're perfectly happy with the money we have , we run our own business and still go out for nice meals			2
' the weird thing is , my visa requirements say i ca n't claim state money anyway , so i could n't even if i wanted to ! ' i spent years supporting @entity6 while he was studying , and then we started our own business			0
so , of course we do n't earn that much money right now			0
' they appealed the @entity15 decision but last week received another letter telling her this had been rejected , and are now facing a lengthy separation and the folding of their business			2
the letter said she would be required to leave the country by next thursday , but she has since started an appeal process			1
she said she had been ' overwhelmed ' by the support she had received , but was determined to make sure more people knew about the strict immigration rules			0
she said : ' even if i do have to leave , i want people to know about this law			0
so many people have no idea , and it 's so unfair			0
' we would have qualified under the old rules and so many people do n't know they 've changed			0
' the couple say they have been told that @entity117 - the right to a private and family life - does not apply in their case			0
mr @entity6 said he had been told that this was because his wife 's immigration status was already seen as ' precarious '			0
among the couple 's supporters are @entity8 mp , @entity127 , and @entity7 parliamentary candidate , @entity128			2
she said : ' this is a young couple who have set up a very successful business in the @entity132 which is an area which really needs more businesses like this			2
more than 2,000 people have signed an online petition in a bid to block @entity4 's deportation @entity4 moved to the @entity5 in 2011 and was working in a coffee shop in @entity54 when she met her husband who was studying philosophy at @entity28 ' i am shocked and dismayed to hear about how the have been treated			1
' i will be talking to some of my friends who are mps and will be trying to find out what can be done			0
' @entity149 's most loyal customers have started a @entity151 campaign to help and more than 2,000 people have signed an online petition to keep @entity4 in the @entity5			2
a @entity15 spokesman said : ' all applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with immigration rules			0
in july 2012 the @entity15 reformed the rules that apply for family immigrating to the @entity5 from @entity162 ( @entity161 ) countries			0
it included the introduction of an £ 18,600 minimum income threshold for sponsoring a @entity166 spouse or partner to come to @entity5 or remain in the country			1
the @entity15 said that it introduced the guidelines to prevent ' burdens on the taxpayer , promote integration and tackle abuse ' and to ensure family migrants can ' stand on their own two feet financially '			0
it acted after receiving advice from the independent @entity176 and claiming it was a level at which ' we can be reasonably assured that the @entity5 sponsor has sufficient means to support themselves and their foreign partner '			0
' we welcome those who wish to make a life in the @entity5 with their family , work hard and make a contribution			0
but family life must not be established here at the taxpayer 's expense			0
' that is why we implemented the recommendations of the @entity193 and established clear rules for @entity5 citizens looking to bring their non-eu spouse to this country , including a minimum income threshold			1
' the pair are now in discussions with an immigration lawyer and plan to appeal the latest decision , but they have also begun to consider other options .			2
