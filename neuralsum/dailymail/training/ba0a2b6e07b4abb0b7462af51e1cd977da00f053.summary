by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 18 may 2012 updated : 13:32 est , 18 may 2012 a career criminal with more than 100 offences has again walked free from court , despite getting a ' last chance ' from the same judge two years ago			1
judge @entity6 decided it was ‘ not in the interests of justice ’ to enact the suspended sentence drug addict @entity9 had been serving during her shoplifting spree			1
the mother - of - one , 25 , already has 33 convictions for more than 100 theft - related and dishonesty crimes			1
but judge @entity16 gave her one ‘ final chance ’ and let her walk free – even though she had broken her supposed ‘ last chance ’ given after her last conviction			1
lenient : judge @entity6 , left , decided to spare career criminal @entity9 , right , who has more than 100 offences on her record jail because it was in the ' interests of justice ' she told @entity9 : ‘ you present me with a real problem @entity9			1
you commit offence after offence and always there is some excuse on your part			0
‘ the question for me is do i send you to prison or not			0
i am persuaded that it is in the interests of justice that i do not activate that suspended sentence			1
‘ it seems to me to offer the best chance at this point in time to dissuade you from committing further criminal offences			0
‘ i ’m giving you a final chance			0
if any of these conditions i impose are breached you are going to prison for 12 months			0
‘ this is a real opportunity			0
’ @entity45 was told @entity9 had stolen two meat joints from a co-op , in @entity48 , @entity49 , on april 12			1
after handing herself in to police , @entity9 , from @entity50 , @entity45 , then tried to steal £ 241 worth of shopping from a nearby @entity54 in nearby @entity55			2
it was only when she tried to exit the store through a closed door and security guards approached her to tell her which door to leave by , that the theft was spotted			0
@entity62 , prosecuting , said : ‘ @entity63 has 33 convictions for an impressive 100 offences			0

‘ this is not the first time she has done this			0
’ @entity74 was given eight months suspended prison sentence by @entity16 in 2010 for handling stolen goods and shoplifting			1
on that occasion @entity78 , defending @entity9 , said : ‘ she ’s well aware that this is her last chance			2
’ mr @entity78 , again representing @entity9 today , asked the judge to give his client a spell at outreach centre @entity84 instead of jail			1
defending , @entity78 , said : ‘ the @entity84 is a very worthwhile project			0
‘ i have seen great success in the past and on this occasion i really think that @entity92 is motivated and she would succeed			0
swaggering : @entity9 , 25 , could hardly contain her delight at being allowed to walk free from the same court where she had promised to mend her ways when notching up one of her previous 100 crimes ‘ i do see a vast change where she has gained an attitude where she wants to address the issues that she has			1
‘ the evidence for this is that she gave a negative reading for drugs when she was arrested			0
’ judge @entity16 backed the plea and handed @entity9 a ‘ strict ’ community order with numerous conditions attached including attending the @entity84			1
she was also given a 12 - month community order , a 12 - month supervision order and a six month drugs rehabilitation order			1
@entity74 also ordered to abide by a two month curfew from 8pm to 7am			2

last year she refused to send prolific burglar @entity120 to jail - before he went on to steal from 22 more homes			2
she then cut his jail term , after he was finally imprisoned			1
in 2010 she failed to send carer @entity123 to prison for stealing from one of her patients - despite describing her offence as a ‘ gross breach of trust targeting a vulnerable victim ’			0
victim @entity130 said she had been left ‘ absolutely gobsmacked ’ by the decision			0
she was criticised in 2010 after a man who stabbed a neighbour over a text message to his girlfriend and a man with 3,400 indecent images of children both avoided custody			0
in february this year , jewel thief @entity140 , of @entity142 , @entity45 , was spared jail despite stealing £ 20,000 - worth of goods from 11 shops .			2
