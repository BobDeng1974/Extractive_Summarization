by @entity0 published : 03:58 est , 7 december 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 7 december 2013 fine : @entity3 film director @entity2 , is facing a £ 100 million lawsuit , after being accused of fathering seven children one of @entity3 's most celebrated film directors is facing a £ 100million fine after allegedly violating the country 's controversial one - child policy by fathering seven children			1
@entity2 , who directed hit movies @entity10 and @entity11 as well as the opening and closing ceremonies at the @entity14 , has admitted having two sons and a daughter with his current wife and a daughter with his ex wife			1
but rumours have been circulating for several months that he has had three more children other women			1
a lawsuit was sent to the @entity24 in @entity25 on thursday , the hometown of @entity2 's wife , half in compensation for public resources , and half in punitive damages			1
@entity32 , one of the lawyers behind the action , confirmed reports that it demands a total of one billion yuan ( $ 100million ) adding they decided to take action against @entity2 because he ' represents a typical case ' of an elite trying to skirt the law			1
she said : ' right now , in @entity3 , this phenomenon of wealthy people having more than one child is very serious , ' @entity46 , the other lawyer , was quoted in the government - run @entity47 as saying the actions of wealthy people such as @entity2 were ' unfair to the poor and those who strictly follow the national policy '			1
' the rich have become increasingly audacious by violating the family planning policy just because they are rich enough to pay the fine ... and they take an extra share of resources from society , ' the court might not accept the case , the newspaper added			2
amid increasing pressure - including a @entity68 newspaper 's publication last month of a front - page ' wanted ' poster seeking information on his whereabouts - @entity2 finally issued an apology on sunday through his studio 's microblogging account			2
controversial : @entity3 's one - child policy was put in place to control @entity3 's booming population , and officials say it has been key to the country 's rising prosperity critics say @entity3 's late - 1970s family - planning law , which restricts most couples to one child , is selectively and sometimes brutally enforced , while the wealthy and well - connected are easily able to pay the fines levied for extra offspring			0
but in recent days some users of @entity3 's popular online social networks have directed their anger at the policy itself , rather than @entity2 , with some hoping the attention heaped on his case may hasten the eventual demise of the law , which authorities have recently moved to relax			1
the policy was put in place to control @entity3 's booming population , and officials say it has been key to the country 's rising prosperity			0
but opposition to it has steadily grown among members of the public as well as among demographic experts , who warn that it has led to a decline in @entity3 's working - age population and a swelling of the ranks of the elderly that could bring about a labour shortage within the next two decades			0
those fears appear to be shared by @entity3 's @entity114 leaders , who after a key meeting in @entity116 last month moved to expand the exceptions to the policy to allow couples to have two children if one of the parents is an only child			2
talent : many of @entity2 's films , such as the @entity123 ( pictured ) have proved popular with audiences in the @entity127 as well as @entity3 spectacular : @entity2 masterminded the breath - taking opening and closing ceremonies at the @entity14 in the past @entity3 web users have typically responded with fury to reports of celebrities escaping the one - child regulation , but sentiments over the past week have been more mixed , with some citing @entity2 as an example of why the law should be scrapped			1
' we should be grateful to @entity2 ! ' one posted on @entity141 , a @entity3 equivalent of @entity142			2
' thanks to his popularity , he 's made the whole society debate the problems of the ' family planning policy ' ! this might help speed up the abolition of this draconian law			0
' another said the controversy was ' more than ridiculous ' , adding : ' @entity153 is a fundamental human instinct and a way of passing things on to future generations			0
here in @entity3 , it 's actually become a crime			0
' in 2012 , 24 of the country 's 31 provinces and regions collected a total of nearly 20 billion yuan in penalties , the @entity160 reported thursday			0
none of the provincial authorities has detailed how the money was spent .			0
