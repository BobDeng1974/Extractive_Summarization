speculation about @entity3 ’s future is nothing new but this time , almost in the blink of an eye , his departure from @entity6 seems inevitable			1
‘ why ? ’ you will ask			0
@entity6 , after all , have not been approached by any club in @entity11 about @entity3 since @entity13 ’s ham - fisted £ 40million plus £ 1 offer last july nor has he personally told @entity15 or members of @entity18 ’s hierarchy that he wants to leave			1
furthermore , the impression in the dressing room is that @entity3 wants to give @entity6 12 more months , to sample @entity22 nights at @entity18 and help the club attempt to go one place better after that remarkable pursuit of the @entity27 trophy last @entity28 scroll down to see @entity30 hero @entity3 get serenaded by his team - mates all smiles : @entity3 in training with @entity30 ahead of their pivotal @entity34 clash with @entity35 emotion : @entity3 celebrates scoring the dramatic late winner against @entity38 bundle : his brace kept @entity30 in with a chance of qualifying from @entity43 with @entity3 , though , you can never relax and the last few days have proven that momentum is building			1
@entity6 have done all they can to keep him , making the 27 - year - old the highest paid player in their history when they offered him a new contract last december , but it seems as if the point has been reached where they can do no more			1
if @entity3 ’s comments after he put @entity38 to the sword in @entity55 set alarm bells ringing , the flurry of stories in @entity59 – the influential @entity61 - based newspaper – and words from his father - in - law @entity63 ( ' this is the right time for him to move , ' he told @entity66 tv show @entity65 ) suggest this is a fight @entity6 can not win			1
they were outstanding 12 months ago when he tried to engineer a move to @entity13			1
@entity15 handled a difficult situation with aplomb , while principal owner @entity72 stood up to player power and maintained unequivocally that @entity3 would n’t get his way			2
but what do they do this time ? today ’s edition of @entity59 reports that negotiations ' are about to begin with @entity6 for @entity3 ' to make him ' the stellar signing for @entity61 ’s 2014/15 campaign '			1
gearing up : @entity3 in a press conference before the vital @entity43 showdown puffed out : @entity3 and his team - mates looking tired at the end of a session @entity6 have had no dialogue with @entity61 but the level of detail in the story includes reference to that @entity91 – a man who was influential @entity92 ’s last summer – will be instrumental if and when the time comes for negotiations to begin			1
for the moment , however , all @entity6 can do is wait and see what unfolds			0
at face value , @entity3 is still a @entity6 player representing his country at the @entity34 but it is impossible to escape the feeling that , very soon , something will happen that will transform the situation			1
who knows ? something could even happen tonight			0
@entity3 is bound to be asked a question if he stops in the @entity106 after @entity30 ’s showdown with @entity35 in @entity108 and given how comfortable he feels speaking to his compatriots , that is where the key answer may be found			1
should that be the case , @entity6 will have no option but to act quickly and decisively			0
for all that @entity15 , @entity115 excelled in the face of last year ’s saga , they could do without another one following them around and dominating the agenda once more			0
july is going to be a busy enough month for @entity15 as it is , with friendlies to play in @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and then @entity127 and the last thing he will want is to be giving daily updates on @entity3 ’s future			0
this time , if @entity61 do come calling , the key is to get the maximum they can out of the deal and have it concluded as swiftly as possible			0
they do not want to fall into the same trap as @entity138 did with @entity139 and @entity140 and still be negotiating with deadline day looming			0
heartache : @entity3 sits in disbelief after @entity6 throw away a three - goal lead against @entity146 embrace : being consoled by @entity147 as @entity6 's title dream slipped away at @entity149 duo : @entity151 fans wlll be desperately hoping it 's not the last they see of these two together selling @entity3 is not a decision that will be made easily			2
he is a sublime talent , comfortably keeps company with the top five in world football , and is blessed with that magical quality of being able to produce those moments of fantasy that others can only dream			0
those who have watched him at @entity18 for the last three - and - a - half years will tell tales to their grandchildren in the years to come about the magic of the man from @entity167 who upheld the tradition of the club ’s fabled no 7 shirt and almost made @entity6 champions			2
for that reason , @entity6 will fight until the very end to keep @entity3 on @entity174			2
but the problem they have is the identity of the suitor			0
when @entity61 and @entity139 set their mind to acquiring a player , the chase only ends one way and @entity6 know this better than most , given what happened in the past with @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			2
@entity61 can pay @entity3 a king ’s ransom after losing high wage earners such as @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 – @entity193 is also likely to leave – while they need to make a statement after seeing their bitter rivals @entity139 win the @entity22 last month			2
the statement they want to make is @entity3 – and that is why it feels inevitable this story is heading for one conclusion .			0

@entity61 are closing in on @entity6 superstar @entity3
but the 27 - year - old is believed to want to stay for 12 more months and experience @entity22 football at @entity18
@entity6 held off last summer as @entity13 attempted to sign the *striker*
he is currently with @entity30 preparing for @entity34 showdown with @entity35
