he 's a father - of - four with plenty of experience as well as a friend of prince @entity5 's , and now @entity6 stepped in with some advice for the @entity8 and @entity9 as they await the birth of their second child			1
but far from top tips on how to juggle changing two sets of nappies , @entity6 's advice was simple ant to the point - get more sleep before the baby arrives			2
' get some sleep because jumping from one child to two is a big step , ' said @entity6 during an appearance on @entity26 's @entity25 , who then confessed that going from two to three was an even bigger leap			1
@entity6 's words of support came as @entity40 announced that the @entity9 will not be attending tonight 's @entity42 opening ceremony and that her trip to @entity44 next week is ' under review '			0
@entity9 , who suffered from the same extreme morning sickness during her last pregnancy , is expected to give birth in the @entity49			0
@entity6 , who has known the @entity8 for a number of years and was a guest at the @entity52 in 2011 , is also in the running to be a godparent for the couple 's second child			1
according to bookmakers @entity57 , @entity6 boasts odds of 16 to one to become a godparent - as does his wife @entity60			0
other favourites include prince @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
long shots include @entity67 and @entity68 at 66/1			2
' it surely has to be a case of second time lucky for @entity62 and @entity63 , ' commented spokesman @entity72 , ' but @entity5 has a real bromance with @entity6 who could well be asked to undertake god - parenting duties this time around			0
' godfather or not , @entity6 also revealed that he was left delighted by the royal baby news and said that the couple are ' great parents '			1
' i ’m so happy for them both because they ’re such great parents and obviously to be great parents and to have the roles that they have , as important as they have , is really incredible , ' he said			2
' i ’m just happy that they ’re going to have another little one running around the house			0
' second child : the @entity8 and @entity9 announced that a second baby was on the way on monday missing out : @entity34 will miss the @entity42 , a passion project of brother - in - law @entity62 thanks to her pregnancy , the @entity9 will also miss a drumhead service at @entity93 with the @entity8 and prince @entity62 tomorrow , to remember all those who have died or been injured in conflict			1
currently being treated by doctors at @entity40 , she is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum , which affects 3.5 per 1,000 pregnancies , causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration , weight loss and a build - up of toxins in the blood or urine , called ketosis			0
it is thought her illness began sometime last week and when @entity5 visited @entity110 on monday without his wife to open the institution ’s new @entity112 , he said the @entity9 had experienced a ' tricky few days '			0
the condition has also thrown her first solo overseas tour into doubt , with the @entity9 due to be in @entity44 on the 20th and 21st september to mark the 50th anniversary of its independence			0
