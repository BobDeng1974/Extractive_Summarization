the service , due to launch in march , promises : ' when your heart stops beating , you 'll keep tweeting			2
' your social afterlife : @entity6 will analyse users ' @entity1 feeds to learn their ' likes , tastes , [ and ] syntax ' to continue posting similar messages , updates and links after they 've passed @entity6 is being developed by @entity25 - based advertising agency @entity24			1
@entity26 , a creative partner at the firm , told the @entity28 he was ready for negative responses to the service			0
' it divides people on a gut level , before you even get to the philosophical and ethical arguments , ' he said			0
' it offends some , and delights others			0
imagine if people started to see it as a legitimate but small way to live on			0
' cryogenics costs a fortune ; this is free and i 'd bet it will work better than a frozen head			1
' although it is similar to the plot of last week 's episode of @entity52 sitcom @entity50 , in which a woman uses social media to talk to her dead boyfriend , the developers claim they came up with the service in 2011			1
posts on the @entity1 feed explain how the ' idea was born a couple of years ago			2
been getting tech partners together			0
' [ @entity62 ] hen black mirror themes were in the press and it seemed the perfect time to get something up			0
but we are genuinely doing the experiment			0
' @entity69 as @entity70 in @entity50 : @entity6 is an eerie echo of the plot of the @entity52 programme , in which a woman uses social media to keep in touch with her dead boyfriend @entity6 uses artificial intelligence algorithms to analyse users ' online behaviour and their style of writing			1
this allows it to scour the internet to post the kinds of links its users like , as well as mimic their manner of communicating and favourite appropriate tweets to create a personal digital afterlife			2
an early post on the @entity1 feed pronounces : ' @entity94 does n't exist , servers do			2
sign up to the real after life			0
' but as bizarre as it might seem , @entity6 is only the latest service to offer to continue your social media life after death			1
@entity101 , launched last april , and if i die , launched in january 2012 , offer users the ability to send predetermined messages from beyond the grave to selected @entity107 , @entity1 and @entity109 accounts			1
@entity101 can be scheduled to post social media updates for long after users have passed away , while if i die posts a single video or text message to the @entity107 wall of any user after three friends confirm their death			1
@entity6 is the first service to offer to automatically continue posting in the style of the dead user , however			1
one person who has registered interest in the service is @entity124 , a businesswoman in her mid- 40s , who said she wanted the chance to have a ' kind of ironic legacy '			0
speaking to the @entity28 , she admitted , however , that ' in the cold light of day , it is a very conceited thing to do			0

@entity6 analyses users ' @entity1 feeds to continue posting in the same style after they are dead
being developed by a @entity25 - based ad agency , who say ' it 'll work better than a frozen head '
it joins @entity101 and if i die in the market for apps offering social media services which continue after death
