by @entity0 and @entity1 when multi-millionaire @entity3 planned his family ’s dream home , every detail had to be perfect			1
the property tycoon set out meticulous plans for the £ 100million house , even telling workers he wanted his new library ’s leather shelves to be hand - stitched to look like the upholstery in an @entity13			2
but when the vast project was hit by delays , his relationship with his design team appears to have soured dramatically			2
abuse : property developer @entity3 branded an architect a ' f * * * * * * little t * * * ' and boasted about his superior wealth in a string of abusive emails mr @entity3 , 50 , said he woke up in the morning wanting to kill his architect , and described the wife of another business partner as ‘ avaricious and jealous ’ and ‘ needing a * * * * * * * good slapping ’			1
he sent around 3,700 emails to firms involved in the project			1
in one , to a director of his building contractors , he fumed : ‘ my middle name is “ @entity38 ”			1
i have the money and anger at this point to push on and make sure that you have to deliver or get punished for not delivering			2
’ he went on : ‘ guess what , when i have forgotten about you in a year ’s time , enjoying my £ 100million home or sailing on one of my 40 - metre yachts , you ’ll still be trying to wind up some other poor unsuspecting customer with your brand of mediocrity – a sad loser – gaining your kicks and being irritating			2
‘ suggest a new career as a traffic warden might be ideal at least it would n’t involve lying			0
’ mr @entity3 , who is worth around £ 134million , threatened to sue the contractor , @entity53 , over the delays and alleged defects in their work at his house , on one of @entity60 ’s most expensive streets			0
but a high court judge said he had ‘ lost nearly all sense of objectivity ’ over the house in @entity65 , @entity66 , and branded the project ‘ a disaster waiting to happen ’			0
mr @entity69 said mr @entity3 ’s behaviour to his architect and the contractors was ‘ not simply coarse ’ but ‘ combative , bullying and aggressive ’			0
mr @entity3 , a trained barrister who founded the property data company @entity76 and affordable homes specialist @entity74 , bought the five - storey townhouse in 2004			0
he wanted it to be a dream home for him , his wife and their two children , complete with a swimming pool , basement cinema , wine cellar , gymnasium , staff quarters , a guest suite and a state - of - the - art ‘ light wall ’			0
his wife @entity91 , a solicitor , spent hours planning it and told the @entity93 she wanted it to be ‘ modern , stylish , with great attention to detail , luxurious with the highest quality of finish with smart , shiny dark glossy floors , luxurious bathrooms , beautiful lighting and elegant perfect finishes ’			1
it appeared cost was no object , as estimates warned that the stitching on the library ’s leather shelves alone was likely to top £ 41,000			0
but as work began , @entity3 and mrs @entity110 noticed a growing number of faults			1
the agreed ‘ @entity121 ’ for the floors was too orange , there were no ballet bars in the gym and mrs @entity110 described the finish in her children ’s bathrooms as ‘ a disgrace ’			1
mr @entity3 said ‘ every room in the house contained defective plastering ’ and told his architects , @entity123 , they were ‘ a disgrace to [ their ] profession ’			1
the case ended up in court earlier this year after @entity133 & @entity134 claimed money had been taken off its payment for alleged defects and delays			0
mr @entity3 ’s firm , @entity139 , counter-sued , asking for damages for alleged defects in the work , and saying it had overpaid for the work			1
but mr @entity69 ruled in favour of @entity53 and said it was owed more than £ 2.3million			0
mr @entity3 , who spent more than £ 6million on legal work for the case , said he plans to appeal against the judgment .			0

@entity110 boasted of his superior wealth in a string of abusive emails
he told the director of one firm : ' your little @entity156 1,800 *sq* ft *cottage* *...* can fit into my dining room '
