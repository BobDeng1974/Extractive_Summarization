by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 19:32 est , 5 july 2013 active : despite playing a range of sports , 11 - year - old @entity2 has been classed as overweight by a government programme aged 11 , @entity2 is a picture of health – and sporty to boot with a love for hockey and hiking with her fellow @entity12			1
but the @entity14 scheme that monitors primary school children ’s weight bizarrely believes that she is fat			1
@entity2 ’s mother @entity18 was outraged when she received a letter describing her daughter , who stands 5ft 5in tall and weighs 9st 10lb , as ‘ overweight ’			1
former nurse mrs @entity2 , 34 , described the scheme as ‘ ridiculous ’ , saying it leaves girls feeling ‘ sensitive ’ about their weight and prone to eating disorders			1
she said : ‘ i was so cross when i got the letter			2
‘ @entity2 ’s tall and slim – far from overweight			1
they tell you she is overweight when obviously she ’s not – she is very athletic			2
‘ the first thing she said when she saw the letter is “ i ’m not fat ”			2
they also sent me a healthy eating leaflet , like i could n’t look after my children			0
' they had n’t even seen my daughter			0
this is the sort of thing that gives young girls eating disorders			0
she is at a vulnerable , impressionable age , getting ready to leave primary school			0
‘ she is very fit and active , she takes the dogs out for a walk in the mornings and walks to meet friends			0
she is also in the @entity12 and hikes for miles at the weekend			0
she plays hockey , rounders , touch rugby and does gymnastics			0
’ @entity2 was weighed at her primary school for @entity55 , set up in 2005 as part of a government strategy to tackle the growing obesity crisis in young people			1
under the scheme , children in their first and last year of primary school are weighed and measured to work out their body mass index , which is calculated by dividing weight in pounds by the square of height in inches			1
results are divided into categories labelled ‘ underweight ’ , ‘ normal ’ , ‘ overweight ’ or ‘ very overweight ’			2
but mrs @entity2 , who lives with her greengrocer husband , @entity71 , 37 , and their children , @entity74 , 12 , @entity2 and @entity75 , six , in @entity76 , @entity77 , thinks the government should overhaul the scheme			1
criticism : @entity2 's mother , @entity80 ( right ) says the programme is leaving girls feeling sensitive about their weight and prone to eating disorders she said : ‘ it ’s not compulsory and i think the parents of overweight children may opt out of doing it , so whatever the results are being used for the system is flawed			1
‘ i think there needs to be something else , not just weighing and measuring , maybe that ’s ok in reception but by @entity97 children ’s bodies are changing with puberty			0
‘ it ’s just not black and white , there is a lot of grey			0
’ mrs @entity2 is not alone in her anger at @entity104			1
a survey carried out by the @entity106 found more than half of parents whose children were classed as ‘ overweight ’ did not agree with the findings			2
the 2010 research found that 53 per cent either disagreed or strongly disagreed with results that their children were fat			0
one mother surveyed said : ‘ you have said that my son is 1 lb overweight , but as long as my son is happy and healthy that is all that matters , and do you realise that with your comments you could cause people to panic and reduce their intake and cause anorexia			1
’ a spokesman for @entity126 said : ‘ the measurement process is overseen by trained healthcare professionals in schools			0
‘ the children are weighed and measured and their @entity131 is then calculated by internationally recognised tables			2
we do not comment on individual cases			0

health police told 11 - year - old @entity2 that she was overweight
@entity2 's mother received a *warning* letter from @entity14 after @entity2 was weighed
