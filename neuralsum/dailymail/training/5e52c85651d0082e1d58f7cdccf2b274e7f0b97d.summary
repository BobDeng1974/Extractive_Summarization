by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 8 may 2012 updated : 15:26 est , 8 may 2012 accused : @entity1 , stands before the judge enters the court for the second day of his trial for voyeurism charges ' sexually graphic and obsessive ' diary entries belonging to the father - in - law of missing @entity9 mother @entity8 were read out in court yesterday in which he described himself as a ' voyeur ' and ' sexually out of control '			1
the judge presiding over the trial of @entity16 will decide today whether or not the excerpts can be used as evidence in the 14 counts of voyeurism against him			1
yesterday , the judge dismissed a charge of possession of child pornography against @entity16 , ruling the 2,000 images - of his neighbor 's children taking a bath - did not prove he influenced the conduct of the subject of the pictures , for example asking them to pose provocatively			1
prosecutors told @entity37 judge @entity36 yesterday they want to use eight portions of @entity16 's diaries they seized from his home last year which range in date between 2003 and 2010			1
samples were read aloud and included phrases like : ' @entity8 likes to be admired and i 'm a voyeur ' , ' i 'm a voyeur and @entity8 is an exhibitionist ' and ' i 've been going nuts and nearly out of control sexually my entire life , ' according to the @entity50			1
prosecutors also noted that in 2004 , @entity16 wrote in his diary that he ' likes taking video shots of pretty girls in shorts and skirts , beautiful women of every age '			2
deputy @entity60 attorney @entity59 said the vast majority of the writing was ' obsessing ' over @entity8 , his daughter - in - law who has been missing in 2009 and talking of how he stalked her and secretly watched or videotaped her			2
center of the debate : @entity1 kept pictures of @entity8 breastfeeding and changing and diary entries detailing he watched her often the judge said yesterday he was reluctant to use the diaries because of how much material mentioned the missing @entity9 woman and seemed to ' prove @entity16 had an obsession with @entity8 rather than proving any pattern of voyeurism '			1
but prosecutors argue that the diaries will help the jury understand how deep he was into voyeurism and pornography			2
excerpts from @entity16 's diary read aloud in court defense attorney @entity85 said the excerpts should not be used because it takes away from the voyeurism aspects of the trial and puts the focus on @entity8 and her husband @entity90 , who killed himself and the couple 's two sons in a fiery explosion in february at a house in @entity95			1
many believed the murder suicide was an admission of guilt in his wife 's disappearance but @entity102 and @entity103 have always maintained that @entity16 had something to do with their daughter 's disappearance			2
@entity108 was the only named person of interest in the case but was never charged or arrested			2
he claimed he took his young sons , then four and two , camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am			0
when he came home , @entity8 was gone and he said she had run off with another man			2
authorities searched the desert for twelve days in the area where @entity108 said he went camping that night			0
at one point , they said they found a ' shallow grave ' after cadaver dogs alerted them to the spot			0
but they found no human remains			0
concerned : @entity8 's parents , @entity127 and @entity128 , hope that @entity1 ' slips ' and reveals something about the 2009 disappearance of their daughter defense attorney : @entity85 , left , talks to @entity1 , the day after a judge dismissed a child pornography charge against @entity16 , the father - in - law of missing @entity9 mother @entity8 defense attorneys argued that even the mention of @entity8 's name would prejudice a jury as it has been such a high - profile case , culminating in the murder of her sons earlier this year			1
it also emerged that a recording of @entity16 sexually gratifying himself while looking at pictures of @entity8 was discovered along with thousands of pictures that focused on her behind and taken while she was breastfeeding			1
@entity60 prosecutors agreed about the risk of prejudice , but said the passages were crucial to prove that @entity1 recorded the images , and that he did it for his sexual gratification			0
other categories of digital files included close - ups of women putting groceries in their cars and others titled , ' dmv girl ' , ' @entity163 ' , ' gum - chewing cutie ' , and ' young teen volleyball player '			0
opening statements in the trial are likely to begin on wednesday , assuming a jury is selected by then			0
center of the debate : @entity1 ( left ) previously claimed that he and @entity8 ( right ) were a perfect match because he was a voyeur and she enjoyed being watched @entity8 's parents @entity102 and @entity103 watched anxiously as @entity16 was led into the courtroom yesterday wearing handcuffs , a tie and gray suit			1
while more than 60 potential jurors filled out questionnaires in another room , prosecutors and defense attorneys discussed how much should be disclosed at the trial about @entity1 's apparent obsession with his son 's wife			0
if convicted of the remaining 14 charges , he would face a guideline sentence of about four years but the state has alleged aggravating circumstances that could result in a longer term			0
the thousands of images found by investigators reportedly show a decade â€™s worth of his work , but in this specific case they are expected to focus on the ones relating to the years 2006 and 2007			0
they volunteered to redact her name , and the judge and defense counsel agreed with the suggestion			0
revelations : @entity207 and @entity208 were beginning to speak more and more about their mother , saying she was ' in the trunk ' and then that she disappeared tragedy : @entity16 blew up his @entity214 home , pictured , killing himself and the two young boys when they were dropped off for a supervised visit happier times : @entity8 's parents , @entity102 and @entity103 , were living with her sons @entity207 ( left ) and @entity208 ( right ) at the time of the horrific incident remaining determined : @entity102 ( center ) and @entity103 ( right ) attended @entity1 's hearing monday @entity8 's disappearance took a bizarre turn last summer as authorities from @entity214 and @entity9 stepped up their efforts to solve the case			1
@entity1 claimed on tv that he and @entity8 had a sexually charged relationship , something her parents denied			1
@entity1 's arrest prompted the state to take custody of @entity108 's sons , who were living with their father at @entity1 's home			0
the boys were turned over to @entity8 's parents , prompting a custody fight that ended feb. 5 , when @entity108 locked a social worker out of his home during what was supposed to be a supervised visit with his sons			2
he attacked @entity207 and @entity208 , 7 and 5 , with a hatchet , then started a fire that killed all three as the social worker called 911 .			0
