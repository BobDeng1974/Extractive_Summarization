by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 12:01 est , 4 june 2013 a plan to open a @entity3 centre in a derelict hotel using £ 1.6million of public funds has been scrapped			1
the proposed martial arts retreat in @entity7 , @entity8 , was today described in a report into the failed project as a waste of money			1
the @entity13 bought the @entity14 in 2007 with the intention of leasing it back to community group @entity17			1
but delays led the building to become an unusable ruin , forcing the decision to abandon the centre			2
today a government committee described the purchase as a ' troubling ' waste of public funds			1
it had been the brainchild of martial arts expert @entity30 who wanted to create the first @entity34 centre outside @entity35			2
failure : the @entity13 spent £ 1.6million on the @entity14 to turn it into a martial arts centre but it has never opened he said : ' it 's just a wreck and that for me is heartbreaking			1
that was a dream that we 'd achieved			0
dreams : @entity30 , head of the @entity17 community group , had hoped to set up the first @entity34 outside of @entity35 ' we got permission from the @entity34 in @entity35 - these things do n't come easy			1
' to stop it like that is heartbreaking			0
it 's been almost like a bereavement			0
' mr @entity30 , a monk , claims constant delays and obstacles created by the @entity55 led to the building deteriorating to the point where it was unusable			0
he claims to have invested £ 90,000 in the centre which he said would have generated 30 jobs			2
he added : ' i am stunned and so depressed after we have worked so hard and spent so much money on the project			0
' it 's five years that have been wasted when we could have been employing people and bringing health and fitness to people			0
' a report released last year said the purchase was ' flawed ' and said evidence suggested the @entity13 probably paid more than the property was worth			1
it has since incurred costs of around £ 200,000 for maintenance and repairs of the building			1
the @entity80 found that by june 2011 , @entity17 had failed to provide evidence that it had secured enough funding to undertake the necessary repairs and improvements to the building , or to pay the rents due under the lease			1
the report also highlighted a ' significant ' conflict of interest with a @entity13 official involved with the project			1
devastated : former @entity3 world champion @entity30 described the decision to abandon the martial arts centre as ' heartbreaking ' the @entity13 's @entity94 made has now made 21 recommendations for improvements following the blunder			1
@entity94 chair @entity98 said : ' this inquiry has been one of the most illuminating and troubling ever undertaken by the committee			0
' the fact that over £ 1m of public money has been wasted as a result of the various decisions taken in the course of this troubled project is concerning enough in itself			2
' but it is the flaws in civil service systems and processes which this inquiry has exposed			0
it left us deeply uneasy			0
' the @entity13 said they would carefully consider the report			2
a spokesman said : ' we recognise that there were shortcomings in the way in which the acquisition and disposal were dealt with			0
' we will carefully consider the public accounts committee 's report and respond formally to them			0
' dispute : community leader @entity30 claimed the project failed because of constant delays and obstacles created by the @entity55			0
