' i regret that chairman @entity10 and his staff have taken the unprecedented and unnecessary step of subpoenaing two members of the @entity4 with the responsibility for the protection of the president , his family and the @entity8 complex , ' @entity114 said in a statement released tuesday night			1
' chairman @entity10 's assertion that this department has been " uncooperative " is simply wrong			1
' @entity114 said his department offered to let ' a number of @entity4 personnel , including the two that have been subpoenaed ' to participate in ' transcribed interviews with committee staff , ' but @entity10 and his team rejected that offer			1
the @entity50 head asserted that it is his job , as it is @entity17 's , to protect @entity4 agents from the ' visibility , public glare , and inevitable second - guessing , of a congressional hearing ' and the agency as a whole from having its work compromised			1
