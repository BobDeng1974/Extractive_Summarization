former vice president @entity0 , defending the @entity1 against charges of bigotry , says its president @entity4 and attorney general @entity5 who are ' playing the race card ' and not the other way around			1
' to say that we criticize , or that i criticize , @entity4 or @entity5 because of race , i just think it ’s obviously not true , ' @entity0 said			1
' my view of it is the criticism is merited because of performance — or lack of performance , because of incompetence			1
it has n’t got anything to do with race			2
' @entity0 addressed the subject during a 10 - hour long interview with journalist @entity25 , a portion of which appeared on @entity27 's website late tuesday night			1
former vice president @entity0 , seen here on the set of @entity30 in december , says it 's ' obviously not true ' that @entity1 criticisms of president @entity4 and attorney general @entity5 are race - related ' certainly we have n’t given up — nor should we give up — the right to criticize an administration and public officials , ' the former @entity35 administration and @entity37 administration official said after @entity25 asked him if there is any ' truth ' to past suggestions by @entity4 and @entity5 that @entity1 opposition to the president is race - related			1
@entity5 has conjectured numerous times that @entity1 hostility to the president and his policies are based , at least partly , on @entity4 's race			1
@entity4 , whose father is @entity53 , is half black			2
he has strongly embraced his @entity57 - @entity56 heritage , as has his wife , @entity58 , whose mother @entity59 lives at the @entity60 with the first family and has made it known in the past that it was preferable to her that her son - in - law was n't ' completely white			2
' the soon - to - be retired attorney general is also black			0
he again claimed in an interview several weeks ago with @entity67 that racism was sometimes an underlying factor in the administration 's struggles with congressional @entity1			1
' there have been times when i thought that ’s at least a piece of it , ' @entity5 acknowledged			1
' i think that the primary motivator has probably been political in nature … [ but ] you ca n’t let it deflect you from … your eyes on the prize			0
' @entity0 also chastised the @entity4 administration in his sit - down with @entity25 for habitually viewing large - scale controversies through the frame of race			1
discussing the @entity90 , @entity91 , shooting of a young black man by a white police officer , @entity0 said he 's ' been disappointed ' with the executive branch 's response to the tragedy			2
' it seems to me it ’s a clear - cut case that the officer did what he had to do to defend himself			0
he was perfectly within his authorities to take action , ' @entity0 asserted			2
' that if you reach through the open car window and slap an officer upside the head and reach for his gun , you know , there is going to be a response			0
' i think there should have been more people who were ready to stand up and say , “ look , the evidence is pretty overwhelming			0
the grand jury has reviewed it thoroughly			0
here ’s what we know			0
” ' continuing , he said , the administration was wrong to have allowed race to cloud the debate			0
' we should not sort of throw it all over on the burden of race , or racial inequality or racial discrimination , as being responsible for this particular event , ' he argued			0
' i think that would be wrong , and [ pauses ] it bothers me that that kind of an incident has generated that kind of response			0
' i do n’t think it is about race			2
i think it is about an individual who conducted himself in a manner that was almost guaranteed to provoke an officer trying to do his duty			0
' it 's president @entity4 and attorney general @entity5 , seated here in the @entity144 of the @entity60 in february with senior adviser to the president @entity146 , who are ' playing the race card ' and not the other way around , @entity0 charged he further took @entity4 to task over decisions he 's made in the last six years as commander in chief , since taking the baton from @entity35 in 2009 , that @entity0 , the former no. 2 government official , believes are to the detriment of @entity56 and have led to the unraveling of the stability abroad that he and @entity37 helped put in place			1
where do you start ? ' @entity0 replied when @entity25 nudged him to say that @entity4 had ' intentionally ' or ' inadvertently ' undone his predecessor 's work			1
passing judgement on the @entity164 president 's handling of @entity165 , @entity0 said it was a ' huge mistake ' for @entity4 to withdraw troops and ' we are paying a price for it now			1
' ' he ’s having to go back in now , and the guy who campaigned on the basis of bring the boys home and get out of @entity165 is now redeploying forces to @entity165 , ' he said , referencing the fight against @entity177			2
@entity4 's so - called ' apology tour ' in @entity179 , @entity180 in 2009 was also ' a huge mistake , ' @entity0 proclaimed			1
' i do n’t think he ever bought into the notion that we ’re at war , in terms of a war on terrorism ; i think he always wanted to treat it as a law - enforcement problem			2
' i think he ’s done enormous damage to the military , ' @entity0 , a former defense secretary under @entity37 said , repeating old lines of attack on @entity4 , who had no military experience when he took office			1
' the way @entity4 is functioning now , he ’s crippling the capacity of future presidents to deal with future crises ' by cutting its size			2
' it takes a long time to build up that military force			0
' @entity0 said he is ' absolutely convinced ' that a future president ' will be faced with a major crisis and will not have the military capability he needs to deal with it ' because of @entity4 's actions			1
' i can go on for hours , ' he said , before cutting himself off			0
@entity0 , left , served as the vice president in @entity35 's administration			1
they are pictured here talking to the press in the @entity213 in 2002 ahead of @entity0 's 10 - day trip across the @entity215 and @entity216 to discuss with allies the @entity165 situation while @entity4 has advocated for a leaner military , it is , ironically , conservatives in @entity222 who are currently standing in the way of a massive increase in defense spending to replace the armed services divisions depleted coffers			1
@entity4 has called for an end to defense spending caps demanded by sequestration legislation as part of his fiscal year 2016 budget			0
defense hawks on the right also want to re-up the defense department 's resources			0
but fiscal conservatives believe that fulfilling the party 's promise to balance the budget over the next decade and put a dent in the federal deficit is of greater importance			0
the official budget put forward by @entity244 on tuesday leaves the sequester in place while instead expanding an overseas account for the military			0
the @entity60 on tuesday called it a ' slush fund ' intended to give @entity1 , generally known as aggressively in favor of the military , ' political cover ' while @entity254 chairman @entity253 , a former @entity1 presidential nominee ' described it as a gimmick .			0

the criticism is ' merited because of performance — or lack of performance , because of incompetence . it has n’t got anything to do with race , ' he said
