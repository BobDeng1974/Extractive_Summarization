by @entity0 determined : @entity1 , 16 , went to sit her gcses just hours after her father died on the first day of her gcses in may , 16 - year - old @entity1 kissed her father goodbye , put on her school uniform and headed off to the exam hall			1
anyone who 'd seen @entity7 face that morning might have assumed it was down to pre-exam nerves			0
but only a few hours earlier , she had been sitting with her beloved father , @entity10 - a teacher - as he drew his last breath			1
he was just 46 and died after battling a brain tumour			1
the gentle kiss on his cheek that morning had been @entity1 's final farewell			1
a few hours later , she was sitting her first paper			0
' my studies had mattered so much to @entity19			0
he was so determined he was going to live long enough for me to finish my gcses , ' says @entity1			1
' the very least i could do for him was keep calm and do my best , regardless of what had just happened			0
' normally i find exams terrifying , but i felt a strange calmness that day			2
' her fortitude in the midst of intense grief , is , she says , a reflection of the support her family received from the @entity35 hospice in @entity36 , @entity37 , where her father 's last days were spent surrounded by laughter and love			1
' walking away from him after he died was the hardest thing i 've ever had to do , ' says @entity1			1
' but he found peace at @entity46 - and so did we			0
' you ca n't sit and think " why me ? life is n't fair " , when you are among people who make you feel full of hope and surrounded by love , as we were at the hospice			1
' the kindness of the volunteers was astonishing			1
@entity19 became unsteady on his feet , and one night when he was alone in his hospice room , he thought he heard someone calling for help			2
he tried to get out of bed to go to them , and fell			0
' after that , we did n't want him to be on his own at night			2
@entity64 said she would be there every evening , but the volunteers drew up a rota among themselves			2
' from that moment on , incredible people - retired grandmothers , nurses who had already finished a 12 - hour shift at the local hospital - took it in turns to be by his bedside night after night			0
happier times : jess with father @entity10 , mother @entity77 , and brother @entity78 ' one lovely lady was in her thirties and had a young baby			1
she must have had constant nights of broken sleep at home , but every week , would give up one of them to chat and read to patients			2
another had seen her own mother pass away at the hospice , and now came in for the night shift			2
the volunteers never asked for praise or thanks , but the kindness of these strangers was awe - inspiring			1
' before @entity10 's illness , the @entity97 family had a happy life together in @entity36			1
their mother , @entity77 , was a teacher , and @entity1 and her younger brother @entity78 , went to the local school where @entity10 once taught			1
@entity1 smiles at the memory of those days , and says : ' @entity19 had always been incredibly enthusiastic and was always joking			1
at the end of each week , he 'd come home and say " it 's that friday night feeling everyone ! " ' but last spring , super-fit @entity10 , who regularly did charity runs and triathlons , began suffering from appalling headaches			1
as wife @entity77 , 46 , recalls : ' he became more and more tired			0
for weeks , he suffered from crippling headaches which did n't seem to shift with painkillers			2
@entity10 had never even taken a day off sick , and always leapt out of bed at 5.15 am to go for a jog			1
but his energy had vanished			0
' he kept working , but in july after weeks of terrible migraines , he had one that lasted for three days and made him vomit			0
@entity77 took him to @entity121			0
fond memories : jess with her father @entity10 , before he moved to @entity46 hospice @entity10 had a brain scan , and shortly afterwards doctors told them there was a large tumour in @entity10 's brain which would need to be removed			1
it was devastating news - but worse was to come			0
three days later , a surgeon at @entity135 in @entity136 explained the tumour was almost as big as a fist			2
he could remove 90 per cent of it , but @entity10 would then need radiotherapy and chemotherapy			1
however , before he had surgery , @entity10 collapsed and a new scan revealed there was bleeding around his tumour			1
a seven - hour operation saved his life , but he developed an infection			2
more emergency surgery was required			0
a month later the two were given more bad news			0
@entity77 says : ' we were told @entity10 had just nine to 12 months to live			1
i wept , but @entity10 was so brave			1
he believed in @entity155 and said he was n't scared			2
we decided not to tell the children it was terminal , but to say it was aggressive			0
' even that news was terrifying , says @entity1			1
' we all cried , but it was n't long before @entity19 was joking again			2
things like , " well , i always have been unique ! trust me to get the worse tumour possible ! " just before @entity164 , he was told he had even more tumours in his brain , and his reaction was " i 'd better make a collection of them ! "			1
' despite the family 's attempts at positivity , in january , just as he prepared for chemotherapy , doctors found he had a tumour on his spine			1
' we were told @entity10 had just nine to 12 months to live , ' says @entity77			1
i wept , but @entity10 was so brave			1
' his mobility rapidly worsened , and it became apparent @entity10 needed more care than his family could give			1
at their @entity186 nurse 's recommendation , @entity10 moved to @entity188 in april			1
but his family were in turmoil			2
' @entity64 and @entity19 told us in january , he was n't going to get better , ' says @entity1			1
' @entity19 was determined not to die at home , because he did n't want us to walk into a room and think , " this is where @entity19 passed away			1
" ' but @entity19 absolutely loved the hospice			2
he just felt so welcome and at ease there			0
it made it far easier for the rest of us			0
' @entity19 , of course , was still laughing and joking			0
a lady came into @entity19 's room and announced she did complementary massage , and @entity19 replied ' is that legal ? ' we all collapsed laughing			2
' @entity78 saw @entity19 every day after school			0
i spent my study leave at @entity188 , doing my revision			2
' after a while , everyone knew us by name			0
we 'd walk down the corridor and staff would hug us			0
' as @entity10 weakened , the family spent more time at the hospice			1
' @entity78 's 14th birthday was in april			2
he had planned to spend it with friends , but did n't want to leave @entity19			0
so the nurses and volunteers baked @entity78 a birthday cake for us all to share			0
' @entity1 says , unlike in many hospitals , where staff are rushed off their feet , ' at the hospice , nobody was too busy to chat			1
' emotions were high , however			0
grieving : husband and father @entity10 passed away at the hospice , leaving his family behind ' one day , it all became too much for me			1
but then a volunteer called @entity239 told me : " he 's still here now and you can talk to him - towards the end of someone 's life they are in a coma , and you wo n't get that chance again			1
so spend that time together now			0
" ' i went back to @entity19 's bed , took his hand in mine , and just sat talking to him			0
i will forever be grateful for her advice			0
' as @entity10 deteriorated , the family moved into his room , all sleeping on mattresses on the floor			1
@entity1 says : ' we 've always done everything together , the four of us			2
the doctors let us know what was happening at each stage			0
i knew they 'd give me an honest answer to anything i asked			0
' we had hoped @entity19 would come home , but in the end he only spent three weeks at the hospice			2
' he was just sleeping in his last week , but we stayed with him , holding his hands , kissing him , and talking through all the wonderful family memories ' it was so peaceful and quiet , and a time to reflect together as a family			0
i do n't think we 'd have ever had that privacy , or the chance to just be together , in a hospital setting			0
it meant that nothing was left unsaid			0
christmas appeal : support the @entity35 hospice 's good works by donating ' the morning @entity19 passed away was the hardest			1
we gave him a kiss , and it was really difficult for us all to leave the room			0
but @entity64 explained it was his body that was left behind , and his soul had left			0
' i went home and had an hour and - a - half to pull myself together and put my school uniform on			0
' @entity1 was awarded 2 a * s , 4 as and 6 bs in her gcses and is currently studying for her a-levels			2
along with her mother and brother , @entity1 continues to visit the hospice and receive counselling			1
she says : ' it became a home , and it helped us through the toughest point of our lives			0
i 'll never forget the love there was for @entity19 - and all of us			0
' the day @entity19 died , @entity78 baked cakes , then went back to the hospice and handed them around			0
it was just hours after @entity19 had died , but it was the best way @entity78 could think of to say thanks			0
' @entity10 , the father who joked until the end alongside the family he adored , would be so proud .			1

the @entity97 family had a happy family life together
but then father @entity10 was diagnosed with a fatal brain tumour
his family could n't look after him , so they moved him to @entity188
they were *overwhelmed* by the kindness of the hospice 's volunteers
@entity188 became a ' home ' for the @entity97 family
and it gave @entity1 the courage she needed to complete her exams
