tourists are being warned that if they want to see ' the real @entity2 ' they should book their trips now , before the @entity12 country becomes ' americanised			1
' president @entity4 announced a ' new chapter ' in @entity5 relations with @entity2 , with plans announced by the @entity17 include easing access for @entity5 citizens , lessening financial restrictions , and lifting the 54 - year - old trade embargo			1
as part of resuming diplomatic relations with @entity2 , the @entity5 will soon reopen an embassy in the capital of @entity38 and carry out high - level exchanges and visits between the governments			1
the @entity5 is also easing travel bans to @entity2 , including for family visits , official @entity5 government business and educational activities			1
tourist travel remains banned for @entity5 , although the relaxing of regulations have led many to believe that this could well be the next issue to be reviewed			1
@entity52 travel expert @entity50 is urging anyone who is thinking of visiting @entity2 to book sooner rather than later			1
speaking to @entity54 , mr @entity50 said : ' it really is a unique place to visit , and once it becomes fully open to the @entity5 , they will without doubt pile in			2
' @entity38 was seen as a party destination for @entity5 years ago , such was its close proximity to @entity60			0
' however you look at it , opening up to the @entity5 will change the way it feels and i think this will be to the detriment to the culture and heritage of the place			1
it is likely that with economic sanctions lifted , @entity2 will change forever , in many cases for the better but there are fears it will lose some of its unique identity @entity38 is famed for its colourful colonial architecture and crumbling buildings ' i would urge anyone who is thinking of visiting @entity2 to book now ; there is something about @entity2 that you just ca n't put your finger on			1
' i would say go now , as you can not be sure the culture and heritage of @entity2 will remain as it is now			2
' looking at searches on december 10/11 against december 17/18 , following @entity4 ’s announcement of a new approach , searches to the destination were up 95 per cent week on week			0
' as one of the popular @entity12 destinations for travellers around the world , @entity2 also remains one of the most affordable , and there is a good choice of flights available from the @entity99			2
@entity100 , head of product at @entity102 , added : ' @entity2 is set to change now that relations with the @entity5 are warming up			1
while @entity105 will doubtless fiercely protect their national identity , customs and traditions - the authentic aspects of @entity2 so loved by holidaymakers - change will come			2
' first time visitors and those already familiar with @entity2 and her charms may be best to visit now and experience the island before the pace of change speeds up			2
' the town of @entity118 in @entity2 is one of @entity120 and offers untapped beauty explore , the adventure travel specialist , is encouraging customers to travel to @entity2 sooner rather than later to experience the country 's unique character and charm before it changes forever			2
@entity127 , managing director of @entity128 has travelled to @entity2 on a number of occasions and has mixed emotions about the news			0
the @entity134 memorial is in @entity135 ' on the one hand it is very evident that change will come at some stage , and that the younger generation of @entity105 are waiting for that to happen			0
while they have excellent education and healthcare , there is still real poverty , and they lack things that we all take for granted such as a choice of goods to buy ( food is mostly from ration shops ) and access to the internet and to world news			0
' he goes on to add : ' on the other hand , part of the charm and intrigue of @entity2 as a travel destination is that it is ' stuck in time ' , with few shops , no global brands and of course a huge number of old gas guzzling 50 's @entity5 cars on the roads			1
' i have no doubt that change will happen quickly once diplomatic relations start to build , and especially if congress agree to start lifting sanctions , which looks likely to happen now , ' he added ' all these things will take some time , but if you want to see @entity2 before change starts to happen and i would really recommend travelling soon			1
' @entity178 , @entity99 manager for @entity179 , said : ' we are thrilled that this historic announcement coincides with the re-introduction of @entity2 in our programme			0
' although the development does not signify any changes in the immediate future for travellers , it does open the door to major developments in the country 's tourism industry and infrastructure to accommodate the increased interest and accessibility			0
' travelling to @entity2 today often feels like stepping back in time – internet access is limited and slow , there are no shopping centres and department stores , all cars go back to the 1940s and 1950s , you will not find any international fast food or coffee chains and all hotels are , either fully or partly , owned or run by the @entity105 state			0
' but as the relations between the two countries improve , change will come			0
at @entity179 , we hope that @entity2 will move away from being a largely all - inclusive destination to offering more opportunities to independent and adventure travellers so they can visit more pockets of this beautiful country and enjoy more authentic experiences			2
' @entity5 president @entity4 announced a shift in policy toward @entity2 in an address to the nation licensed @entity5 travelers to @entity2 will now be able to return to the @entity5 with $ 400 in @entity105 goods , including tobacco and alcohol products worth less than $ 100 combined			1
this means the long - standing ban on importing @entity105 cigars is over , although there are still limits			0
the @entity5 is also increasing the amount of money @entity5 can send to @entity105 from $ 500 to $ 2,000 per quarter , or every three months			0
early in his presidency , @entity4 allowed unlimited family visits by @entity234 and removed a $ 1,200 annual cap on remittances			0
secretary of state @entity237 is also launching a review of @entity2 's designation as a state sponsor of terror			0
@entity4 does not have the authority to fully lift the long - standing @entity5 economic embargo on @entity2 , given that @entity245 enacted that policy			1
however , officials said he would welcome lawmakers taking that step .			0

tourism travel for @entity5 to @entity2 is still banned , but that could change
travellers urged to book trips to @entity2 now to witness unspoiled heritage
@entity4 has eased economic relations , and more sanctions could be lifted
