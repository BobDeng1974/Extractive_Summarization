by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 08:28 est , 29 january 2014 giant industrial robots are used to build cars and move heavy packages			0
and now @entity6 inventors have created a miniature desktop version that can pour drinks , fetch items and even play the xylophone , should you be in need of urgent music in the office			2
the creators of the @entity17 tiny industrial desk robot envisage it could be installed on every office desk to make life easier in the future			1
here , the machine unpacks the contents of a box it is designed to help with minor manual tasks from moving business cards to pouring liquids and used together , the @entity32 - based company @entity31 says the robots could form a production line , much like their larger counterparts used in factories around the world			1
the miniature machine has 4 - degrees of freedom , which is created using three servo motors on the base to control the main movement of the arm and a mini servo on the top , to move and rotate an object			0
it has enough strength to easily lift and move a full drinks can thanks to a small vacuum pump at the end of the suction cup on the arm			0
the robotic arm has enough strength to easily lift and move a full drinks can ( pictured ) thanks to a small vacuum pump at the end of the suction cup on the arm when operated together , the machines can perform more complex task , such as transferring liquid from one cup to another the creators of the @entity17 tiny industrial desk robot ( pictured ) envisage it could be installed on every office desk to make life easier in the future the movement of the robot follows the movement of a computer mouse and the wheel can be used to raise and lower the machine 's arm the @entity17 can be controlled with a mouse and a desktop computer using a @entity81 app. the company is also working on an @entity84 and @entity85 app too so that the robot could be operated using smartphones with a @entity89 connection			1
the robot 's arm mirrors the movement of a mouse so that when a user scrolls down using the wheel of a mouse , the arm of the robot is lowered			2
operators can also programme in x , y and z coordinates so that the robot can perform specific actions without a person controlling the robot ’s servo motors directly			0
the design of the diminutive robot , which is made from either acrylic or wood , is inspired by the industrial robot arm @entity111			2
@entity17 can be customised to suit the needs of its user			0
here it is pre-programmed to move items around and shows off its dexterous grabbing action @entity6 inventors created the miniature desktop robot that can pour drinks , fetch items and even play the xylophone ( pictured ) @entity31 ’s @entity124 page says : ‘ robots are awesome , and would n't it be nice if everybody who wants a robot arm can actually afford one ? after all , $ 50,000 ( £ 30,160 ) is kind of a lot of money			1
this is when we , the @entity31 come in			0
’ a spokesman for the company said @entity17 will be able to be customised to suit the needs of its user			0
‘ you can add a led to make a computer - controlled desk lamp or install it on the arm on a mobile robot chassis base and move it around			1
or even play music on a xylophone , ’ he said			0
the robot is designed to help with minor manual tasks such as moving business cards and unpacking a box ( pictured ) cheers ! when used as a pair , the robots can pour liquid between cups ( pictured )			1
they are made from either wood or acrylic and can be programmed to perform bespoke tasks using open source software @entity31 originally asked for $ 5,000 ( £ 3,150 ) of investment on crowd funding site @entity124 , but has pulled in over $ 71,000 ( £ 42,825 ) so far , showing that its labour - saving robots are in demand			1
the company hopes to begin shipping the robotic arms in may			0
@entity17 robots are currently available to order from @entity124 – although some models have sold out			2
a kit containing an acrylic arm with a gripper and sucker costs $ 229 ( £ 138 ) and comes assembled for $ 279 ( £ 168 ) plus shipping			1
mechanical kits without the motors and electric modules start from $ 69 ( £ 42 ) and a custom model costs $ 1,000 ( £ 603 )			0
the design of the @entity17 was inspired by giant industrial robots that are used to build cars ( pictured ) and to move heavy packages the robots are controlled by a mouse and can work together to perform more complex tasks			1
but as they cost $ 229 for an assembled kit , a factory - style production line does n't come too cheap			2

inventors in @entity32 , @entity6 , think their @entity17 robot could be installed on every office desk to make life easier in the future
it is designed to help with minor manual tasks , can be controlled by a computer mouse and come in wood and acrylic
the robots are available on @entity124 and cost $ 279 ( £ 168 ) assembled
