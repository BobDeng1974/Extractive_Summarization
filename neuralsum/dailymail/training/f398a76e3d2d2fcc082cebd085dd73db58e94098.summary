if the woman in your life woke up grumpy this morning , do n’t be too hard on her			0
it is , apparently , only natural			0
scientists have discovered that women need more sleep than men			1
and chances are , she ’s not getting enough			0
in fact the best thing a loving husband or partner can do is perhaps persuade her to get a few extra hours snuggling under the duvet			0
researchers in the @entity18 found that women suffer more than men , both mentally and physically , if they are forced to go without sufficient sleep scientists say women suffer more than men , both mentally and physically , if they are forced to skimp on their sleep			1
as well as a higher risk of heart disease , depression and psychological problems , sleep - deprived women have extra clotting factors in their blood , which can lead to a stroke			1
they also have higher inflammation markers , which indicate developing health problems			2
as inflammation markers are also linked to pain , sleep expert dr @entity35 explained that women can literally be in more pain when they wake up			1
that ’s enough to make any girl feel rather grumpy			0
by contrast , the state of a man ’s health does not appear to be closely linked to how much he sleeps			1
in the study , carried out by scientists at @entity48 in @entity49 , men showed no increased risk of developing the ailments that affect women when they are losing sleep			1
according to dr @entity35 , sleep - deprived women are angrier , more hostile and more aggressive ‘ we found that women had more depression , women had more anger , and women had more hostility early in the morning , ’ said dr @entity35			1
if this sounds like someone you know , it can probably be blamed on sleep deprivation and the fact that women are particularly susceptible to the effects			1
what does dr @entity35 advise ? if you do n’t manage to get enough sleep at night , try taking strategic naps			2
however , he warned that those naps should be either 25 minutes or 90 minutes long			0
any other length will make the snoozer feel worse when they wake , he said			0
this is not the first time experts have suggested that women need more sleep than men			1
one of @entity81 ’s leading authorities on sleep found that women actually need 20 minutes more shut - eye			1
this is because of the female multi-tasking brain			0
‘ one of the major functions of sleep is to allow the brain to recover and repair itself , ’ said professor @entity86 , director of the @entity87 at @entity88			2
‘ during deep sleep , the cortex – the part of the brain responsible for thought , memory , language and so on – disengages from the senses and goes into recovery mode			2
‘ the more of your brain you use during the day , the more of it that needs to recover and , consequently , the more sleep you need			0
‘ women tend to multi-task – they do lots at once and are flexible – and so they use more of their actual brain than men do			0
because of that , their sleep need is greater			0
‘ a man who has a complex job that involves a lot of decision - making and lateral thinking may also need more sleep than the average male – though probably still not as much as a woman			2

women are more angry and hostile if they get *insufficient* sleep , say @entity49 scientists
sleep deprivation also increases women **'s** risk of heart disease , stroke and depression
but a man **'s** health is *barely* affected by lack of sleep
