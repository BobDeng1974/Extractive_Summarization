@entity0 has left @entity3 's @entity2 training ground after going through the rigours of a medical having reached an agreement to join the @entity7 club			1
the former @entity9 striker is on the brink of signing for @entity12 ' side in a deal worth £ 125,000 per week			1
@entity0 earlier had scans at @entity15 before completing the rest of the medical at @entity2			0
however the @entity18 will not be available to make his debut against former club @entity9 on monday night , with the registration deadline of midday having passed			1
@entity0 's agent held discussions on thursday and friday , with a key point believed to be the @entity73 outfit 's desire to obtain some kind of guarantee about the discipline of the mercurial 24 - year - old @entity49 striker			1
the player on thursday added credence to the reports that he is set to return to @entity82 football by saying it would be his last day at @entity34 's training ground			2
the @entity86 side followed that later with a statement on their website revealing he had said his farewells to his team - mates			0
@entity3 have been looking for a marquee striker to replace the departed @entity40 this summer but their interest in @entity0 represents a remarkable about - turn from around three weeks ago			1
boarding : @entity0 , pictured here last year , is flying to @entity3 on friday to complete the deal leaving : @entity0 revealed on thursday that he would be leaving @entity34 agreed : what @entity0 might look like in a @entity3 shirt , after he agreed personal terms with the club @entity99 - @entity98 , £ 23m @entity101 - @entity100 , £ 20m @entity103 - @entity102 , £ 12m @entity105 - @entity104 , £ 9.8m @entity106 - @entity98 , £ 4m @entity107 - @entity98 , £ 20m @entity109 - @entity108 , £ 10m @entity111 - @entity110 , loan @entity0 - @entity34 , £ 16m when @entity3 played @entity34 in a friendly in the @entity114 , manager @entity12 expressed admiration for @entity0 but subsequently ' categorically ' said he was not a target			1
recently , however , a move for @entity119 's @entity118 has collapsed while interest in former @entity122 striker @entity121 has cooled and attempts to sign @entity124 from @entity125 seem unrealistic			0
with new signing @entity106 the only frontline support for @entity128 and the transfer deadline nearing , a move for @entity0 has apparently become more attractive			2
he is a proven performer and scored @entity49 's winner in the @entity133 opener against @entity52 in @entity134			0
but the baggage that comes with him is considerable			0
his spell at @entity9 from summer 2010 to january 2013 was a whirlwind one , with occasional sparkling performances interspersed with volatility on the field and erratic behaviour off it			0
title race : @entity3 boss @entity12 sprints to keep up with @entity106 and @entity57 out of time : @entity12 has not been able to complete the deal in time for @entity0 to face @entity9 prepared : @entity12 is ready to welcome @entity0 for his medical after agreeing personal terms with the striker his numerous misdemeanours famously included fireworks being set off in his bathroom , throwing a dart at a youth - team player and training - ground bust - ups with team - mates and manager @entity155			1
on the positive side he played a key role in the @entity159 win and contributed to the following year 's @entity7 success , but he also hindered progress by accruing four red cards			0
city - for whom he scored a total of 30 goals in 80 appearances in all competitions - eventually tired of the circus surrounding him and offloaded the former @entity171 star to his boyhood club @entity34			0
proven : @entity0 has scored goals in the @entity7 before , and has international experience for @entity49 jetting in : @entity0 , pictured with his girlfriend @entity177 , is flying to @entity3 on friday			2
