describes seeing in the @entity2 in a theatre ' though perhaps not the kind of theatre i would ideally have chosen ' by @entity7 reporter published : 09:58 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 10:00 est , 27 september 2012 a librarian who vowed to laugh in the face of terminal cancer by writing a comedy book has lost his battle against the illness			1
@entity14 , 64 , was diagnosed with multiple myeloma - cancer of the bone marrow - four years ago			1
but the upbeat grandfather refused to be defeated by his illness so he wrote an autobiography called ' @entity20 ' , which went on sale at @entity22			2
@entity14 with wife @entity25 just after his ebook about his cancer battle was published on @entity22			1
@entity25 said her husband was ' thoughtful and selfless ' in his book , @entity14 who said he was ' a hypochondriac by profession , but a devout coward by religion , ' described feeling like he was being ' marked up for target practice ' as he was prepared for radiotherapy			1
in another entry from when he was confined to a wheelchair @entity14 wrote : ' it had become my oft - repeated claim while in hospital that i had n’t had a ‘ drink ’ since @entity39 but had been legless since @entity2			1
' after completing his book , @entity14 ’s bone marrow cancer was initially declared inactive by doctors and he was sent back home and could walk around the house unaided			1
but later tests showed the myeloma was back and @entity14 had to have more treatment			1
he was admitted to hospital last week after becoming poorly and his condition deteriorated suddenly			0
he died at @entity50 on saturday surrounded by his family			1
his wife @entity25 , near @entity54 , @entity52 said : ' i have lost a caring , thoughtful and selfless husband who faced his illness with courage and determination , but above all , his ever present sense of humour			0
' as a family , we are overwhelmed by the many touching tributes we have received and we will miss @entity14 dearly			1
' @entity14 began suffering from twinges in his back in 2008 just as he was about to retire from his job of 43 years as a librarian for @entity70			1
the pain gradually worsened and @entity14 ’s leg suddenly seized up			1
investigations revealed he had a tumour on his spine and he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma			2
@entity25 and @entity77 on @entity14 's 60th birthday , a year before he was diagnosed with cancer			1
he kept his sense of tumour despite undergoing several grueling treatments doctors were unsure whether @entity14 would ever walk again			2
he spent the next five months in hospital undergoing surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy			0
during his illness , @entity14 had to deal with pneumonia , septic shock , chest infections and a bad case of shingles			2
he then spent seven months in a nursing home and was unable to stand up			0
in the book , @entity14 speaks of the first time that he dropped the pun used for the book ’s title into general conversation with his friends and family			1
he writes : ' the silence which followed this admittedly dreadful pun you could have cut with a knife , and the sight of jaws dropping had to be seen to be believed			0
' but then a smile appeared , and then another , but at least the cries of " @entity111 ! ” and “ @entity14 ! ” when they arrived were accompanied by smiles			2
' the fun loving family man also wrote of how his regular ritual of celebrating the turn of the year at a theatre in @entity54 had been interrupted by his surgery			2
@entity14 described his experiences being treated for cancer and how doctors often used terms he didnt ' understand he joked : ' having seen the @entity2 in the previous two years at a concert at the @entity124 in @entity54 , we would have probably done the same again that year had it not been for my condition , yet lo and behold i was going to see 2009 in at a theatre in @entity54 after all , though perhaps not the kind of theatre i would ideally have chosen ! ' medical procedures in hospitals are often littered with phrases that the patient does not understand , and @entity14 ’s treatment was no different			1
@entity14 speaks about his visit to the hospital to be ‘ marked up ’ for radiotherapy			2
he said : ' i seem to remember a voice saying that it was t9 but at the time this did n’t mean anything to me			0
i gather now that the area where they had put the metalwork in my back covered an area something like @entity148 so , if that makes it sound like a game of @entity150 , i suppose that in a way it was ! ' he also speaks of himself as ' an inherently lazy person ' who does not shave because ' the time he spent doing it would be far better employed staying in bed for an extra few minutes '			0
during his battle with multiple myeloma , he has had to deal with pneumonia , septic shock , chest infections and a bad case of shingles			0
he calls the after - effects of the latter condition “ the @entity164 ”			0
he said of one doctor : ' he made me walk up and down the ward , then stuck his finger up my bum and sent me home			0
well , i think he , i think he was a doctor , he was wearing a white coat and carrying a clipboard , but sometimes when i think about it i wonder			0
' he recalled coming round from anaesthetic and said : ' for some reason believing i was on the set of @entity175 but looking from a balcony over @entity178 ’s skyline a night			0
' at the time the book went on sale @entity14 said : ' writing this book has certainly helped me with my illness			1
if you are scared of something , it is easier to joke about it			0
it is a way of escapism			0
' being a coward about anything medical , i never would have envisaged myself being able to cope with cancer , but i have done			0
i ’m also hoping to dispel the myth that all librarians are stuffy , boring and serious			0
' you can only get away with joking about cancer if you actually have it yourself			2
