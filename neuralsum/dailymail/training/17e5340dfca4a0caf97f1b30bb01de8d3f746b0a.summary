by @entity0 published : 14:33 est , 8 december 2013 updated : 14:38 est , 8 december 2013 uniformed @entity2 police officers have begun patrolling the streets of @entity4 to help fight a growing tide of criminality among their immigrant countrymen			1
in scenes which could soon be replicated in @entity9 , 20 officers have been introduced to help clamp down on @entity12 street gangs			1
it follows a 78 per cent rise in the number of @entity2 arrested in the @entity17 city over the past two years			1
twenty @entity2 officers have joined @entity4 forces in a bid to clamp down on @entity12 street gangs ( file picture ) in january , the @entity9 is expected to see an influx of @entity2 and @entity24 arriving when @entity26 labour restrictions are lifted			1
there have been warnings that they will include criminal gangs that often use children to target their victims			0
last month a squad of eight detectives from @entity2 and three officers from @entity35 joined the @entity36 on raids , interviews and working in custody suites to crosscheck records with their own police database			1
in @entity17 it has been reported that @entity2 teenagers work with adult gangsters to prey on tourists visiting famous monuments like @entity47 and the @entity49 museum			2
the @entity12 gangs use a variety of tricks to try to con money out of people , including pretending to be deaf and dumb , or saying they are involved in charity collections			1
if these fail , they pickpocket their victims , or threaten them with violence before running off			0
the situation has become so bad , that the @entity2 officers were drafted in last week – mainly because they can communicate with the gangs			2
there has been a 78 per cent rise in number of arrests of @entity2 in @entity4 over past two years ( file picture ) a statement issued by police in the @entity17 capital reads : ‘ wearing their own uniforms , they are taking part in patrols of public areas and supporting their @entity17 colleagues in securing the major tourist and shopping centres			1
’ the statement says they will ‘ contribute to collecting information , and to the identification of @entity2 criminal networks ’			0
at present , most of the gang members say they can not speak a word of @entity17 , making dealing with them hugely difficult			0
many are illegal immigrants who never carry any kind of identification papers either			0
ten @entity2 police are now based permanently in @entity17 and have helped break up 10 suspected theft rings in less than a year			1
the scheme has now been extended to officers patrolling the streets with at least 20 officers based in the city			1
it has led to a five per cent drop in @entity2 street crime this year , but the @entity17 government said that @entity2 from the impoverished eastern @entity100 state are still responsible for a massive amount of anti-social behaviour			2
in @entity17 it has been reported that @entity2 teenagers work with adult gangsters to prey on tourists visiting famous monuments like @entity47 and the @entity49 ( pictured ) a tourist is pickpocketed in @entity4 ( file picture )			2
@entity17 police say the @entity2 officers will work with them at shopping centres and the major tourism sites many live in vast illegal camps on the outskirts of @entity4 which the police regularly try to shut down			1
children arrested by the police can seldom be prosecuted , and are instead let off with a caution at most , leaving them free to carry on with their crimes			0
in september , @entity122 , the @entity17 ’s socialist interior minister , said most of the estimated 20,000 @entity2 in @entity17 had no intention of integrating into society and should be deported			2
this has led to an outcry among opponents , including many in his own party , who think that eastern @entity100 immigrants should be given a chance to build lives for themselves abroad			0
attempts to deport them usually end with those sent home coming straight back again			0
last month , @entity4 police smashed a @entity2 pickpocketing ring which trafficked hundreds of children across @entity100 , including @entity9			1
all recruits were threatened with severe beatings if they did not go out to steal			0
more than 200 children , some as young as 12 , were given targets of stealing up to £ 250 a day before being dropped off in the centre of the city , and ordered to target tourists			0
many of the minors involved were arrested , cautioned and released hundreds of times , but were simply sent back out to steal			0
gangs of aggressive @entity12 youngsters have become a routine sight in central @entity4 , especially around cash points .			0
