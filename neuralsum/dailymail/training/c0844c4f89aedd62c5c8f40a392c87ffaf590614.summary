' miss @entity2 , 25 , spent four years in prison after being accused of murdering her roommate , @entity26 student @entity24 , while the pair were studying in @entity28			1
she was released in 2011 after an appeal against her conviction was upheld , and has now released an autobiography , entitled waiting to be @entity32 , in which she tells her side of the story			0
in the book , she claims that the sexual humiliation began as soon as she was arrested along with her boyfriend @entity39 , according to the @entity40			2
a doctor ordered her to strip and proceeded to examine her genitals with his hand as police looked on			0
' he measured and photographed my intimate parts , ' she writes			0
the pair fell under suspicion when miss @entity48 , 21 , from @entity49 , was found dead in the home she shared with miss @entity2 - she was half - naked and had been stabbed multiple times in the neck , prompting speculation she was the victim of a sex game gone wrong			2
cleared : the @entity12 student after a judge upheld her murder appeal in october 2011 , allowing her to leave prison after four years in which she was subjected to a series of assaults the @entity12 initially confessed to having witnessed the killing , which she blamed on @entity24 , manager of the bar in @entity28 where she worked			1
but she now says that the confession was a result of her rough treatment by @entity5 officials - up to eight policemen would stand over her shouting ' you 're lying ! ' as she was confined in a tiny room , and another officer twice hit her in the back of her head			1
after being convicted of murder and sentenced to 26 years in prison , miss @entity2 says she found herself receiving unwanted attention from @entity81 , a top prison warden			2

she writes in the book : ' he 'd say , " i hear you like to have sex			0
how do you like to have sex ? what positions do you like most ? would you like to have sex with me ? no ? i 'm too old for you ? " ' couple : miss @entity2 with then - boyfirend @entity39 soon after the murder of @entity24 miss @entity2 even suggests that the guard made medical officials lie to her and tell her she was @entity16 - positive , as an excuse to have more sexually explicit conversations with her			1

i 'd still have sex with you right now			0
promise me you 'll have sex with me			0

experience : miss @entity2 's new book , right , recounts her trial on suspicion of killing @entity24 , left the @entity12 insists in her memoir that she always got on with miss @entity48 , saying : ' we developed a comfortable familiarity in a short time			1
' i treated @entity24 as my confidante			2
@entity24 treated me with respect and a sense of humour			2

after she was released in october 2011 , miss @entity2 returned to her native @entity127 and has now entered into a new relationship			0
last month her acquittal was overturned , meaning the case will be retried in @entity5 , but the 25 - year - old is very unlikely to be extradited to stand trial in person			2
