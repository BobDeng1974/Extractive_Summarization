the @entity15 , known as ' @entity16 ' and ' the @entity17 ' , was recently discovered in the @entity18 in @entity19			2

on it 's way here ? the piranha - like @entity15 could soon be in the @entity14 may want to reconsider : this man was pictured in the @entity25 yesterday			1
experts fear the @entity15 could soon be found in @entity14 waterways fishermen in @entity29 have reportedly bled to death after losing their testicles to the vicious teeth of the fish , a relative of the piranha			1
when @entity15 turn up in strange places , it is usually because the owner of an exotic aquarium has dumped one			2
it was found in @entity43 waters for the first time in august with experts warning men to keep their trunks on if swimming in the @entity49 channel between @entity50 and @entity51 now it has migrated to @entity54 , there are fears it could be on its way to the @entity14 's lakes and rivers			0

a fishing competition on the river some years ago - today , when a @entity15 turns up in strange places , it is usually because the owner of an exotic aquarium has dumped one fish expert @entity70 told the @entity71 earlier in august : ' the @entity15 is not normally dangerous to people but it has quite a serious bite			1
there have been incidents in other countries , such as @entity77 , where some men have had their testicles bitten off			0
' they bite because they 're hungry , and testicles sit nicely in their mouth			0
' a fisherman in @entity19 called the river police when he reeled in the frightening looking fish , which can weigh as much as 25 kilos , last friday morning ' he sent us an image of the picture through his smart phone and it turned out to be a @entity15 , ' said a police spokesman			1
' it is a fish with a very dangerous bite ! ' the @entity15 is technically a vegetarian , but tends to be attracted to male genitalia for unknown reasons			0
@entity15 grow quickly in captivity and , unlike goldfish , will outgrow aquaria , so owners release them into whatever pond they can find locally when one was found in @entity50 last month , @entity105 professor @entity104 said : ' all we suggested was that swimmers keep their pants on until we know if there are more of these fish out in our brackish waters			2
