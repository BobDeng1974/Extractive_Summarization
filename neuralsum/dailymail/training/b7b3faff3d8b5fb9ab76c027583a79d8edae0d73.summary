@entity6 had the device fitted in a five - and - a - half hour operation at the @entity39 in @entity40 in october last year			1
@entity41 @entity42 he then returned to the hospital in november to have the device switched on			1

around 1,000 people in the world have auditory brain stem implants , which were first used in humans in 1979			2
only a handful of surgeons around the world perform the complex neurological procedure			0
it involves surgeons implanting a microchip into the patient 's brain stem so they can recognise and process sound			0
the technology is similar to that of a cochlear implant - using electrical stimulation - the brain stem implant uses electrical impulses to stimulate the brain , rather than the cochlea			2
most recipients of the implant only have an awareness of sound			2
it 's described as being able to hear the beat , but not the melody			2
after being implanted , the device needs to be reprogrammed by specialists regularly as electrodes can overlap with other parts of the brain stem , causing tingling in other parts of the body .			0

@entity6 was born two months premature with hearing impairment
he was fitted with an auditory brainstem implant at a hospital in @entity40
