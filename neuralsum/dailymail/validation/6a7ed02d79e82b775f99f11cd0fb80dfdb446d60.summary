the mother of a man who stands accused of murdering 12 people in a movie theater gun rampage has begged prosecutors to stop pursuing the death penalty , terming their legal case a ' quest for death '			1
@entity12 , whose son @entity13 , 27 , opened fire at a busy screening of @entity17 film @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , also insists that she and her husband @entity18 ' were good parents '			1
the @entity12 family claim that mental illness is to blame for the murder spree , which left 70 injured as well as the 12 fatalities			1
mrs @entity12 begged the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty in an entry in her prayer book , which she published earlier this month and is selling for $ 15			1
her prayer for the prosecutor reads : ' i do not know what you have been through in life			0
i do not know why you want to pursue execution of a mentally ill man			1
' but i pray for you , so that you will find peace in your life			0
i pray you will change your mind			0
please stop this quest for death so you may focus on those who are alive			2
' she also also gave an interview on the book to the @entity70 local newspaper from her home in @entity72 , @entity73 , saying that offering her son a plea deal would prevent a painful trial			2
' good parents ' : @entity12 suggested that she and her husband @entity18 , right in the above image , had not done anything wrong she said : ' this would all come to a grinding halt if [ @entity13 ] could plead guilty , and the @entity83 would accept the plea for life without parole			1
' mrs @entity12 also defended herself and her husband from charges that they contributed to the massacre			1
she said : ' because so many people like to blame the parents if a child is mentally ill , we have to reaffirm to ourselves every day that we were good parents and good people , and this still happened anyway			1
' mrs @entity12 did , however , say the couple feels guilt ' that we did nâ€™t recognize he was ill and needed treatment			1
' on sale : @entity12 published a book of prayers for people involved in the murder , which sells for $ 15 according to her , the killing was completely out of character , and the first time she was aware of her son having anything to do with guns			2
she told the @entity70 : ' our kid was quiet , compliant , obeyed all the rules			0
he never bothered anyone , he never harmed anyone ... we never owned a gun and he showed no interest in guns			0
' this is the first time mrs @entity12 has been interviewed since the killings in july , 2012			1
the couple had remained entirely silent until last december , when they wrote a letter to the @entity125 newspaper , insisting that their son ' is not a monster '			2
other parts of @entity12 's book deal with her feelings at each stage of discovering her son was responsible for the massacre			1
in an entry from jan. 12 , 2013 called @entity135 , she wrote : ' what were you thinking , @entity138 ? and what are you thinking now ? praying for @entity138 in jail ; please do n't commit suicide			0
' you lived so that we could understand you and others could study you and learn to prevent future tragedy			0
' in another from march 22 , 2013 , titled memories , she again defended her son			0
she wrote : ' my son never harmed anyone			0
people think he is a monster , but he has a disease that changed his brain			0
... praying for good men and women engulfed in psychosis and alone with their disease			0
' mrs @entity12 writes in the book that proceeds will be donated to mental health services , not to her son or his case			2
but victims ' families have questioned the timing , as defense attorneys have asked a judge to move the proceedings , saying pretrial publicity has made many prospective jurors biased against @entity12			2
' i can only think this is some kind of ploy			0
this is some type of strategy cooked up by the defense to try to save someone 's life , ' said @entity179 , whose son @entity180 was killed in the shooting			1
' ploy ' : the father of victim @entity184 , pictured , described @entity12 's book as a ' strategy cooked up by the defense ' @entity12 ' mother 's thoughts and apologies mean little to him , he said			2
' as far as people i think about on a daily basis , they are so far down the list it 's not worth mentioning			0
' neither @entity12 ' parents nor an attorney representing them immediately responded to requests for comment			2
mrs @entity12 said her son 's defense team had no knowledge of the book			1
' this book is being published to raise awareness of the immorality of the death penalty and the futility of seeking justice through execution , ' she writes			1
a spokeswoman for district attorney @entity213 declined to comment on the book , citing a gag order that prevents those involved in the case from talking about it			0
but in court filings released monday , prosecutors , arguing against a change in venue , wrote that the one thing jurors remembered most clearly so far was their sympathetic letter to the @entity125 .			0

@entity12 , whose son @entity13 killed 12 in massacre , has spoken out
prayed prosecutors would *abandon* death penalty for 2012 killings
trial for 27 **-** year **-** old 's shooting spree in @entity10 , @entity11 , begins in april
