a group of young @entity2 expats in @entity3 have unleashed controversy back home by encouraging others to join them for a cheaper life			1
the high cost of living in @entity2 has driven many to up sticks to the @entity12 capital , with the fact that a popular chocolate pudding can be bought for a third of the price there used to highlight the issue			1
however , the exodus has sparked fury in @entity2 , with one commentator labelling the trend ' disgusting '			1
some still refuse to visit @entity12 or buy products it makes			2
even if the economic argument is justified , @entity2 largely feel that giving up should remain out of bounds			2
' what does any of that have to do with @entity3 ? what does any of that have to do with the disgusting trend of encouraging @entity2 to emigrate ? ' columnist @entity50 wrote in @entity54			1
' the war over our home needs to be fought at home			0
' the uproar began several weeks ago when a 25 - year - old former @entity2 army officer flaunted photos of his grocery receipts - including those of a popular chocolate pudding that sells in @entity12 for one - third the price in @entity2 - and boasted about the good life in the @entity12 capital			1
the idealization of @entity3 is viewed by many in @entity2 as a hurtful provocation now known as the ' @entity71 ' protest , after the pudding 's @entity2 name , the @entity73 campaign has received 17,000 ' likes ' and pictures of @entity2 holding signs asking @entity12 chancellor @entity78 to give them a visa have gone viral			1
@entity2 tv channels have sent reporters to @entity3 to cover the thriving @entity2 expat community there			1
finance minister @entity84 , whose centrist @entity86 party rode the 2011 protests to become a major player in @entity2 politics , said he sympathized with the burden of the new protesters but not their method			2
' these people are anti-zionists			0
i 'm a @entity95 , i think @entity40 should live in @entity2 , ' he said			2
' that does n't change the fact that the cost of living is high here ... the cost of living is not the only question for a person to consider when deciding where to live and by which values			1
' the former army officer behind the protest said he still loves his country , defends it when it is slandered in @entity108 and would prefer to live in @entity109 but just ca n't afford it			0
he said his goal is to spur politicians like @entity112 into action			0
' my aim is to educate the @entity2 government			2
they need to make @entity2 a more attractive place for young people , ' said the slim man with short - cropped black hair and dark brown eyes , in an interview the @entity124 in @entity3 this week			1
he asked that his identity be withheld because he wants ' the public to focus on the message , not on the messenger			0
' one commentator said that ' the war over our home needs to be fought at home '			0
pictured is the @entity109 city skyline and beachfront he said thousands of exasperated @entity2 have asked him for help in getting visas			2
he reasons that if @entity2 vote with their feet and simply leave the country , the government will be forced to serve the public better			2
cabinet minister @entity144 , son of former prime minister @entity145 and a member of the ultranationalist @entity148 party , told the @entity54 newspaper that he pities ' the @entity2 who no longer remember the @entity39 and abandoned @entity2 for a pudding			1
' in the daily @entity152 , columnist @entity151 argued that such ultranationalists were actually driving the young away , but that was still no excuse to bolt			0
' @entity3 is a lovely city , but it is sucking away all the forces that we desperately need here , especially now , ' she wrote			2
like many other expatriates drawn to @entity3 's cheap housing and vibrant lifestyle , thousands of @entity2 already call the city home , according to the @entity124			1
since many enter @entity12 with other @entity165 passports or come for limited periods of time , it 's hard to track exact numbers : estimates range from 3,000 to 30,000			1
many come to enjoy free university study and work as artists and musicians			0
others have opened small businesses and organized hebrew language classes and activities for children			0
those with @entity12 passports are also eligible for a welfare stipend of almost 400 euros a month			0
@entity181 , a 46 - year - old who moved to @entity3 nine years ago , said he enjoys the calmer pace of life and the relief that his daughter is growing up far away from bomb shelters and rocket attacks			0
' i like how people in @entity3 are so non-judgmental and take me as i am , ' said @entity181 , who works in customer service and is now fluent in @entity12			1
in practice , demographers say the phenomenon is more symbolic than actual			0
the number of @entity195 who move to @entity2 is much higher than the number of @entity2 heading to @entity108			1
take @entity198 alone , which has @entity108 's largest population of @entity40 , at about 500,000 : emigration this year to @entity2 is set to top the annual record of nearly 5,300 set after the @entity202 in 1967 , according to the @entity203 - in part due to concerns about @entity206 and @entity198 's sluggish economy			2
@entity208 , a leading demographer from the @entity209 , said @entity2 emigration has actually dropped considerably in recent years and those who did leave were headed primarily to the @entity212 and @entity213 , not @entity108			0
he said the latest @entity215 figures showed that 2012 had the lowest emigration rate in decades			0
that same year , only 3,065 @entity2 were documented as living in @entity3			1
' there is a big gap between the mood and the facts , ' he said			0
even so , the idea of people leaving when the going gets tough is hard to swallow in a country where struggle and sacrifice are so engrained in the national psyche			0
former @entity2 prime minister @entity228 once derided @entity2 who left the country as ' a cascade of wimps			0
' commentators have suggested he would be turning over in his grave if he knew about the @entity234 group behind the come - to - @entity3 campaign , whose name uses the @entity239 word typically reserved for @entity40 immigrating to @entity2 - ' aliyah ' - in describing its actions .			1

a popular *dessert* being a third cheaper in @entity12 highlights the issue
it 's now known as the ' @entity71 ' protest , after the pudding 's @entity2 name
