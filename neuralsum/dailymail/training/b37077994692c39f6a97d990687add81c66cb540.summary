[ headerlink archeologists have been left scratching their heads after the unearthing of part of an ancient @entity5 sphinx in northern @entity6			1
the find has prompted @entity8 to speculate as to how the stone - carved mythical creature travelled so many miles from its original resting place			2
some speculate that it may have been looted from the @entity5 thousands of years ago , while others suggest it was likely to have been given by @entity5 as a gift to its neighbours			1
the writing reveals that the sphinx was dedicated to @entity5 ruler @entity37 , who ruled circa 2500 @entity25 and was builder of the smaller of @entity40 's three great pyramids			1
it is the first statue ever to have been found that was created for the leader , and the first time an @entity5 statue has ever been found in the ancient @entity47 region - today 's @entity6 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
the writing also says : ' beloved by the divine souls of @entity51			0
' volunteers of the @entity53 work during an excavation in the @entity28 @entity6 archeological site of the ancient @entity29 , where they found the remains of a @entity22 with a hieroglyphic inscription archeologists have been left scratching their heads after finding the @entity5 sphinx with hieroglyphic inscription between its paws dating circa 3rd century @entity25 at the @entity6 dig @entity5 's magnificent @entity65 - one of the engineering marvels of all time - are situated at @entity40 just outside @entity67			1
the pyramids are generally believed to be tombs for the @entity70 and / or a resurrection machine for the rulers ' rebirth			2
the remarkable and baffling find was stumbled upon by archeologists working in the @entity29 dig site , in @entity6 's @entity77 in august 2012			1
but only now having carefully removed the incrustation , are they able to clearly see the inscriptions			0
@entity81 , an archaeology professor at the @entity53 in charge of the @entity29 dig , told @entity84 that the sphinx would have originally been placed by the temple of @entity37			1
his is the smallest of the three great pyramids at @entity40 , @entity67			1
@entity29 was the capital of southern @entity89 , founded circa 2,700 bc and at its peak covering approximately 200 acres and home to some 20,000 @entity92			0
it was destroyed in the 13th century @entity25 so far , only parts of the feet and the face have been retrieved , but archaeologists hope to find more of the sphinx as they continue the dig. mr @entity81 believes the sphinx was brought to @entity29 3,000 years ago , either as war booty or as a gift to the then ruler of @entity29 by an ancient @entity5 king			1
he said : ' that it arrived in the days of @entity37 himself is unlikely , since there were absolutely no relations between @entity5 and this part of the world then			1
' @entity5 maintained relations with @entity44 , especially via the ancient port of @entity110 , to import cedar wood via the @entity112 , so they skipped ' today 's northern @entity6 , he said			1
another option is that the statue was part of the plunders of the @entity92 , who in the late 17th and early 16th century @entity25 ruled lower @entity5 , the expert said			1
' @entity5 records tell us that those foreign rulers ... plundered and desecrated the local temples and did all kinds of terrible things , and it is possible that some of this looting included a statue like this one			1
' but to @entity81 the most likely way the sphinx reached @entity29 is in the form of a gift sent by a later @entity5 ruler			1
the small sphinx is believed to be the only one found from the pyramid of @entity137 - the smallest of @entity40 's great pyramids the most distinctive feature of @entity141 , in the background , is the topmost layer of smooth stones that are the only remaining casing stones on a @entity144 @entity40 's three great pyramids , built for the fourth dynasty kings @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity37 , also known as @entity37 , who ruled from 2589 - 2504 bc ' the third option is that it arrived in @entity29 some time after the @entity150 started in 1,550 @entity25 , during which @entity5 ruled @entity89 , and maintained close relations with the local rulers , who were left on their thrones , ' he said			1
' in such a case it 's possible the statue was sent by the @entity5 ruler to king of @entity29 , the most important ruler in this region			1
' @entity160 said the statue was most likely deliberately broken by new occupiers at @entity29 in an act of defiance to the old rule			2
finding the sphinx was ' unexpected , ' said @entity81 , ' but fits ' archaeological facts and findings			2
' when you 're in a bank , you find money , ' he said			0
@entity173 , who manages the @entity174 , was the archaeologist who unearthed the finding in august 2012			0
' it was the last hour of the last day of the dig , ' she told @entity84 of the moment of the find			2
' we all leapt with joy and happiness , everyone was thrilled			0
' ' we hope the other pieces are here and that we find them in the near days , ' she said			0
the first and great pyramids at @entity40 was constructed by @entity147 ( also known as @entity147 ) the son of @entity189			1
@entity147 ruled around 2589 - 2566 when the @entity190 was nearing its peak of prosperity and could afford to build the vast structures			0
constructed of 2,300,000 blocks limestone and granite blocks , the total weight is 6.5 million tonnes			0
the whole structure reached 140 metres in height and had a base length originally of 230 metres			0
it is believed that the stone blocks were hauled up sloping ramps , lubricated by water , using manpower			2
the outer white face of the pyramid was finished with soother and polished limestone			0
inside the pyramid are a number of chambers and passages			0
the burial chamber is almost six meters tall , and was built by solid blocks of granite to prevent penetration			2
it is believed that construction took 20 years			2
the original entrance to the great pyramid is on the @entity221 , 15m high ; the modern entrance is located several metres down and was forced in the 9th century			2
the other two pyramids were constructed by @entity37 ( also known as @entity37 ) , which is the smallest , and @entity148 ’s ( who is also known as @entity148 )			1
@entity148 ’s pyramid looks higher than @entity147 ’s but it is actually half a metre smaller but built on higher ground			0
the most distinctive feature of @entity141 is the topmost layer of smooth stones that are the only remaining casing stones on a @entity144			0
some believe that the @entity22 has the face of @entity148			0
others argue that it was @entity147 , and that it was part of @entity147 ’s pyramid complex			0
and others believe that it was there before @entity147 built his pyramid			0
due to the vast expense , the end of the @entity190 and the movement of the capital to @entity244 , modern day @entity245 , the @entity70 started to be buried in tombs cut out of the rock in the @entity249 and the construction of pyramids ceased .			0
