by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:25 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 11:34 est , 4 september 2013 @entity3 chief engineer @entity2 was tortured to death by @entity6 officials the chief engineer of a state - owned @entity3 company was tortured to death by @entity6 officials who repeatedly dunked his head into a tub of icy water , in an attempt to extract a confession for corruption , it has been claimed			1
mr @entity2 , who was in his early 40s , had his head held underwater by six investigators after being been held for 38 days in detention in the city of @entity21			1
a coroner 's report concluded that mr @entity2 had died after inhaling fluids that caused his lungs to malfunction - an official way of saying he drowned			1
the state - run @entity31 newspaper , published photographs of several bruises on the body of mr @entity2 , and claimed he had been tortured during a severe interrogation process know as shuanggui in which officials are asked to confess wrongdoings			1
the investigators will now be tried for intentional assault			0
a @entity6 member of the @entity44 , mr @entity2 was said by his wife , @entity45 , to have been ' a strong man before the shuanggui process , but he was thin by the time he died			1
' @entity2 's family says the injuries are proof that he was beaten , starved and otherwise tortured by investigators in the eastern city of @entity21 where he lived			1
' he was thin like a beggar , ' said @entity45 , describing seeing @entity2 on april 9 in a local hospital			1
' he was lying there so pitifully			0
... anywhere that we could see , there were injuries on his body			0
' under shuanggui interrogations , suspects are whisked away into a shadowy detention			1
it operates beyond the law , with people held for weeks and months at a time with no regard for the normal , if often ignored , legal protections @entity3 citizens are supposed to be entitled to			2
mr @entity2 was picked up on suspicion of corruption in a land deal in the city of eastern @entity3 city @entity21 where he lived and worked defenders of the system say party investigators need unchecked power to prevent officials suspected of malfeasance from using their influence to block such inquiries			1
by keeping them in solitary confinement , the argument goes , officials are unable contact others who might be implicated or police or judges they might have influence over			2
and it has been used against powerful officials , most recently @entity90 , a high - ranking politician brought down in spectacular style last year following his wife 's involvement in the murder of a @entity96 businessman			2
the former railways minister , @entity97 , who now faces charges of taking bribes and abusing his power , also was under the party 's investigative detention system			2
@entity2 was wanted for questioning for possible corruption in a land deal when he was picked up by investigators			1
run by the party 's @entity106 , the investigations have time limits of up to six months and usually take place in hotels or guesthouses , according to a 2010 book on arbitrary detention in @entity3 by legal scholar @entity115			2
high - ranking @entity3 politician @entity90 was also subjected to the shuanggui torture process detainees are guarded even when they use the toilet , @entity115 writes , and are subject to sleep deprivation and beatings			0
because the targets and interrogators are party members and are bound by the party 's disciplinary code , the process is girded in silence , its details mostly kept out of public view			0
when the probe is concluded , investigators sometimes turn the suspect along with selected evidence to prosecutors for what is often a perfunctory prosecution with guilt a foregone conclusion			0
no figures are made public on the number of people put through the party 's detention system annually			0
@entity147 said the number of corruption cases the party investigates — about 150,000 cases last year — provides some indication , though the detentions are likely to be far higher since each case usually involves multiple suspects			0
the attention that @entity2 's case has brought comes at an inconvenient time for the party			1
there is growing pressure from legal reformers and the public to do away with another form of punishment with flimsy legal underpinnings : a system that allows police to jail people in labor camps for up to four years without a court trial or judicial review			0
because recently installed president @entity174 came to power pledging to root out widespread corruption , the shuanggui detentions may be used even more frequently , not less — setting back legal reforms			0
' the use of shuanggui delivers not justice , but selective and vindictive prosecutions often based on torture , and will do little to straighten out @entity3 's rotten officialdom , ' @entity179 researcher @entity178 said			0
before he died , @entity2 , a party member since 1998 , had been a rising figure in the @entity44 , a state - owned company that according to its website invests in energy and other industries and manages 4.6 billion yuan ( $ 750 million ) in assets			1
@entity2 had been appointed by provincial leaders for a temporary assignment at the @entity194 agency in @entity195 that oversees @entity3 's biggest state - owned companies			2
he was arriving back from the capital on march 1 but instead of being picked up as usual by his ex-wife , @entity198 , who was waiting in the car outside , he made a hurried phone call before being whisked away by investigators			0
it was the last time she heard his voice .			0
