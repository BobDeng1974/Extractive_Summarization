after a couple of spins , @entity3 relaxes on the ground and chews on his foot instead			0
@entity3 puts three paws together before using his left hind leg to propel himself around on the spot @entity3 's owner is heard saying that the @entity36 taught himself to pull off these moves the owner is heard saying : ' believe it or not , we did never teach him this			1
