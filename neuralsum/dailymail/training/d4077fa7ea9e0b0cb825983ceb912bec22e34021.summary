by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it may be a little cruel to suggest the green look on friday to the @entity5 pitch for the third test will suit @entity7 more than @entity9 ’s bowlers but there is no question it is not just @entity13 under severe pressure on sunday			1
the failure of @entity9 ’s attack to take advantage of conditions made for them at @entity19 means there are question marks over the senior bowlers going into a match where the consequences of another defeat would not bear thinking about			2
the success of @entity28 and then , with short - pitched bowling that had failed @entity9 , @entity26 was a salutary lesson to an @entity9 attack who should have had the @entity33 won on the first morning after @entity13 won the toss			0
@entity60 famously brought @entity41 and @entity42 into the @entity9 side at the expense of @entity63 and @entity64 in @entity65 during his first reign as coach and now he must decide whether the time is right to call time , at least temporarily , on one of the big two			1
neither @entity41 nor @entity42 are coming to the end of the line but , with three back - to - back tests still to come , the time is surely right to freshen up the attack and allow @entity46 and @entity77 a chance to prove their worth			1
the last thing @entity9 need is to go back to the days in the 80s and 90s when their constant chopping and changing undermined a fragile side but there is a strong case for @entity87 , in superb form for @entity89 , to replace @entity90			0
@entity46 was unlucky to be dropped in the first place after making an outstanding impression in one - day cricket but there was a feeling he was still stuck in limited - overs mode in a @entity48 against @entity97 where he failed to take a single wicket			0
new generation ? @entity9 coach @entity60 may change one , or both , of @entity41 and @entity42 recall ? @entity46 could return to the side having featured in both tests against @entity97 this summer falling over : @entity103 will hope to get his chance to stake his claim to be an @entity9 all - rounder this week still smiling : all - rounder @entity90 is likely to be dropped after a horrendous run with the bat for @entity9 laugh and joke : @entity41 ( left ) runs with a rugby ball during training as @entity112 ( right ) tries to catch him taking on the field : @entity13 's captaincy has come under scrutiny recently and he needs a big third test looking up ? @entity9 lost the second test and trail 1 - 0 in the series but need to avoid defeat at the @entity5 now @entity46 is said to have got his wrist position right again for first - class cricket and was swinging the ball at pace at @entity125 against @entity126 this week			1
@entity90 has a huge role to play in @entity9 ’s future but his woeful run with the bat means he will surely miss out now			2
it is whether @entity77 replaces either @entity41 , @entity42 or even @entity132 that provides @entity9 with an intriguing question on a pitch that @entity136 believe will have pace , bounce and carry			1
clearly it is harsh to blame @entity41 for what has gone wrong this season because he was man of the series against @entity97 , man of the match against @entity7 at @entity145 and has thrown his heart and soul into the ‘ new ’ @entity9			1
yet his failure to live up to his billing as the best swing bowler in the world when it most mattered at @entity19 was an indication , as much as anything , of his severe workload that is exacerbated by the retirement of @entity156			0
@entity41 looked out on his feet at @entity19 and has the threat of suspension for the last two tests of the series hanging over him so @entity9 must decide whether to utilise him now or take him out of the firing line			1
@entity42 simply did not look fit at @entity19 , where he had perhaps his worst test for @entity9 for many a year , and clearly the knee injury that has restricted his potency will need an operation sooner rather than later			2
yet he is a fighter and both wants and expects to play in the first ever @entity33 in @entity9 to start on a sunday , a move which has seriously hampered @entity136 ’s chances of cashing in on only their second test at this purpose - built ground			2
debutant : exciting wicketkeeper - batsman @entity173 will replace @entity174 in the @entity9 side entertainer : @entity173 ( right ) is an explosive batsman who could excite the @entity5 crowd during the test poor form : @entity42 ( second right ) is under pressure to perform having had his worst match for @entity9 at @entity19 looking on : @entity41 ( centre ) talks to his team - mates during a meeting on the pitch in training ticket sales have been sluggish with the ground expected to be no more than half full from monday onwards but one man who just might provide the spark that could put more bottoms on @entity5 seats is debutant @entity173			1
all the young players brought into the @entity9 side this year have made an impression but none are as potentially exciting as the gifted @entity173 , who must now try to bring his innovative , explosive game to test cricket			2
‘ test cricket has been my ultimate goal and this has probably come a bit sooner than i expected , ’ said @entity173 on friday			0
‘ but it means i ’m going in the right direction and i ’m excited about sunday			0
’ @entity173 had insisted after his sublime one - day century against @entity97 at @entity206 ’s earlier this season that he was not ready for @entity33 but the physical demise of @entity174 has elevated him to the all important batsman - keeper slot			1
out : @entity9 wicketkeeper @entity174 is taking a break from cricket as he recovers from injury throwing it away : @entity9 do not want to go 2 - 0 down in the series with a defeat at the @entity5 ‘ mentally i ’ve come round to the fact i was closer than i thought at the time because my cricket has progressed quickly , ’ said the softly - spoken @entity173			1
‘ test cricket is going to be completely different but this year i ’ve been scoring more runs in the championship and everything ’s been going well			0
’ now @entity173 , who admits he will have to adapt his game to the ultimate format , has the added responsibility of having to excite as well as score runs and provide glovework that he admits is ‘ still a work in progress			0
’ ‘ if you look around the world there are people who play in an aggressive manner and do well , ’ said the man who joined @entity229 this season to keep regularly			0
‘ when @entity236 played for @entity9 people were excited to watch him and @entity238 has filled that role with @entity240			0
it would be silly of me to go into my shell completely and curb my natural instincts			0
’ there is much for @entity173 and whatever bowlers form the @entity9 attack to play for on sunday			0
goal : captain @entity249 will be hoping to help @entity7 to go 2 - 0 up in the series at the @entity5 form : @entity7 's @entity26 used some brilliant short bowling to help beat @entity9 at @entity19			1

captain @entity13 and coach @entity60 have big decision to make
@entity9 were out - bowled by @entity7 on green pitch in second test at @entity19
@entity41 and @entity42 have been below par and one or both may be replaced
@entity77 and @entity46 are in line to be called into the test side
@entity90 likely to be dropped after *dismal* run with the bat
@entity173 will make his test debut at wicket - keeper , replacing @entity174
@entity273 against @entity7 starts at the @entity5 in @entity136 on sunday
@entity7 lead five - match series 1 - 0 after *95* - run *victory* at @entity19
