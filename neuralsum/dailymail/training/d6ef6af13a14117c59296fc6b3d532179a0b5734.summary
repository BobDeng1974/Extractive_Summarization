there is a bar in the labyrinth of alleyways around @entity4 that is named in honour of the famous @entity7 youth academy , @entity8			1
on friday night , it was packed tight with @entity7 fans and locals watching @entity12 play @entity13 on the old television set fixed high on a wall in a corner			1
it was bedecked with @entity7 memorabilia , its walls plastered with team posters celebrating the glories of the last decade , pictures from @entity23 after the @entity25 triumph of 2011 and from @entity26 , later that year , when @entity7 won the @entity27			1
@entity28 buries his head in the netting as @entity7 lose against @entity31 without managing to score @entity7 forward @entity32 could not inspire them to win against @entity31 on saturday in @entity34 @entity31 's striker @entity35 ( left ) celebrates after scoring the goal that defeat @entity7 at the @entity37 @entity38 will have been delighted to see the way that @entity7 struggled on saturday afternoon and by the door , there was a drawing of @entity43			1
‘ crisis ? ’ he was saying from a speech bubble			2
there ’s nothing to see here			2
’ until saturday , it seemed to fit the mood			2
@entity7 were supposed to be in meltdown around the turn of the year , with rumours of a schism between @entity32 and new coach @entity55			1
but they had recovered spectacularly , winning their last 11 games in succession and scoring 23 times in their previous five league games			0
everyone thought the old @entity7 were back			1
the general assumption was that saturday ’s match against @entity31 at @entity37 would bring victory as a formality and act as a prelude to crushing @entity67 in the @entity25 round of 16 for a second consecutive year			1
the @entity70 newspapers were unanimous about what the match against @entity31 would yield : three points to take @entity7 back to the top of @entity34 by leap - frogging @entity75 and a hat - trick from @entity32 to lift him above @entity78 in the battle to be @entity80 , the league ’s leading scorer			1
but things did n’t go to plan			0
@entity7 lost 1 - 0 , their first home defeat since a november 1 defeat by @entity86 , and the air of confidence that had surrounded their visit to the @entity90 for the first leg of their tie on tuesday evaporated			1
so forget the speech bubble in the @entity8 bar			0
every defeat is a crisis here			0
and now there is something to see			0
now , pleas for calm will go unheard and @entity67 and their fans will feel fresh hope that this is , indeed , a @entity7 side incapable of scaling the heights of old			1
@entity7 defender @entity105 ( right ) tussles for possession with @entity31 midfielder @entity108 @entity7 's @entity32 looks on dejected after @entity35 's goal put visitors @entity31 ahead in the first half @entity28 writhes around in agony as his side searched for a response to get back into the game @entity116 ( right ) is at full stretch in an attempt to keep the ball in play during saturday 's @entity34 clash when the final whistle sounded on saturday afternoon , the @entity7 players headed straight down the tunnel as the club hymn blared from the loudspeaker system , doing its best to drown out the chorus of whistles from the crowd			1
by then , there were swathes of empty blue and red seats all around the cavernous bowl of the @entity37			1
all the uncertainties , all the fears that had assailed them earlier in the season had come flooding back			0
they looked listless , unsettled , agitated and bereft of ideas against @entity31 , who had chances to add to the winning goal scored by @entity35 in the seventh minute			1
@entity28 , who has been showing signs of overcoming the disappointing start to his career here since his £ 70m summer move from @entity146 , was close to anonymous again , noticed only on the multiple occasions he was caught offside			1
tuesday ’s tie will mark his first return to @entity150 since the leaving of @entity146 and he is a figure much reduced			0
at @entity153 , he was larger than life			0
he was the biggest story in town , the team ’s most talented player and the man the fans looked to for inspiration			0
he is in the shadow of another now			0
not just @entity32 but @entity165 , too , and he is finding it hard to adapt			0
maybe a visit to @entity150 will give him a fresh burst of bloody - minded motivation			2
@entity28 was brilliant in @entity150 but he looks like a figure much reduced in @entity171 with his new club the @entity28 that @entity67 will face at the @entity90 on tuesday is a different prospect to the one at @entity146 @entity165 struggled , too , and even @entity32 failed to make an impression			1
stuck out wide on the right , he curled in a few sumptuous crosses but they either sailed just too high or were headed clear by @entity31 ’s massed defence			1
@entity67 will have been encouraged by the defensive vulnerability exhibited by tuesday ’s opponents , too			1
@entity35 ’s goal came courtesy of a shocking defensive error by @entity105 and , with better finishing , @entity31 would have capitalised on several swift counter-attacks			1
@entity7 may be a different side in @entity187 this week but @entity67 showed them way too much respect in the first leg at the @entity90 last season			1
saturday 's game provided ample encouragement for them to be more ambitious this time			2
this is not the @entity7 of old			1
this is not a team capable of dominating @entity197 football as they once did			0
their crown has been slipping for some time , as anyone who recalls their @entity25 annihilation by @entity202 will know			0
this is a team trapped in the tortures of transition			0
if @entity75 win at @entity206 today , they will go four points clear of @entity7 at the top of @entity34 , adding to the feeling that the energy and the vigour in @entity34 resides with them			2
when @entity78 usurped @entity32 as the world ’s best player by retaining @entity217 ’s @entity216 award this year , it was another sign of the shift in power			0
@entity32 leaves the pitch dejected after a poor showing as he failed to make an impression out wide @entity165 was also off the boil and struggled , which can only be a good thing for the @entity150 champions a fin de siècle feeling seems to be settling over the @entity37			1
it was beautiful while it lasted but the great side moulded by @entity229 is breaking up			2
@entity230 , @entity7 ’s great general , turned 35 a few weeks ago			2
@entity231 is passé , superseded by the power and pace of @entity202 and @entity75			0
the zeitgeist has moved on			0
@entity32 is still a magician , of course			0
@entity236 wrote in his newspaper column last week that ‘ it is never a bad day when you can watch one of the best footballers ever pull on a pair of boots ’ and , of course , he is right			0
it is still a privilege to watch @entity32 play			0
even on days like saturday , some of his touches and some of his passing was sublime			2
but even he looked fretful			0
individually , @entity32 , @entity165 and @entity28 are three of the best players in the world			2
as a forward line , though , they look like an awkward fit			0
while @entity7 were struggling , @entity67 were handing out a pasting to @entity257 in the @entity258 @entity259 scored twice to add to goals from @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 at the @entity90 @entity236 wrote in his newspaper column this week : ‘ it is never a bad day when you can watch one of the best footballers ever pull on a pair of boots ’ it is nine years ago on sunday that @entity32 first impressed himself on the wider @entity150 consciousness when he produced a scintillating performance in a @entity7 @entity25 victory against @entity274 at @entity275			1
the @entity274 left - back , @entity277 , was sent off for kicking @entity32 into the air near the corner flag in the first half , which brought forth accusations of play - acting from @entity282 , still in his first coming as @entity274 manager			2
@entity274 left back @entity277 kicks @entity32 into the air at @entity275 nine years ago on sunday @entity277 was sent off by referee @entity285 for the challenge and @entity32 was labelled a ' dirty dog ' but the @entity288 produced a scintillating performance , although he did not manage to score @entity32 , for the crime of being hacked by opposing defenders , was assailed by the wrath of one newspaper in particular			2
‘ @entity296 , ’ its headline read			0
@entity32 has been making headlines ever since			0
the world has been unable to take its eyes off him as he has become one of the greatest players in the history of the game			0
the feeling here is that , for all their stars , @entity7 are more dependent upon him than they have ever been			2
if they are to stave off further decline , if they are to quell fresh talk of crisis , he will have to be at his very best on tuesday night in @entity187 because , after saturday , @entity67 will smell blood			1
last season city were knocked out by @entity7 in the @entity25 at the last - 16 stage city had players sent off in both legs , here it 's @entity317 in the first leg who sees red from the ref @entity321 ( not in shot ) was then sent of at the @entity37 as @entity187 's sky blue side went out			1

@entity7 *surprisingly* lost 1 - 0 to @entity31 at the @entity37 on saturday
@entity67 , meanwhile , won 5 - 0 against @entity257 at the @entity90
@entity28 is having trouble in front of goal and again failed to score
the @entity7 side in its current state can not dominate @entity333
