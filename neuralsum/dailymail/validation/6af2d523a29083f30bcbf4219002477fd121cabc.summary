director of public prosecutions @entity0 has announced a review of all forthcoming trials or retrials regarding the prosecution of journalists the prosecution of journalists accused of paying public officials for leaks was in turmoil last night after law chiefs announced a review of all forthcoming trials or retrials			1
@entity0 , the @entity14 , made the decision as anger grew that a ‘ witch - hunt ’ had been conducted to pursue reporters who exposed stories kept secret because they embarrassed those in power			1
last week , lord @entity22 , the lord chief justice , expressed misgivings that the obscure 13th century law of misconduct in public office was being used to haul journalists before the courts			1
police and prosecutors have faced criticism for spending up to £ 20million of taxpayers ’ money on @entity34 , an investigation into tabloid newspapers paying for information , rather than concentrating on terrorism and violent crime			2
@entity40 and the @entity41 have brought to trial 24 journalists as part of the investigation , launched in the wake of phone - hacking allegations			1
but only three have been found guilty			0
and of those , a former @entity49 reporter had her conviction for paying a prison officer for leaks quashed last week , while fellow journalist @entity53 was given leave to appeal			0
the @entity56 reporter was the first journalist found guilty under @entity58 and received a six - month suspended jail sentence			2
but on friday , lord @entity22 overturned her conviction after finding judge @entity61 , who presided over the trial , ‘ misdirected ’ the jury over the ‘ level of seriousness ’ required to have committed an offence			1
now it has emerged that the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , will not face a retrial			0
two co-defendants also had their convictions quashed but the prison officer is expected to be tried again			0
mrs @entity0 made the decision after holding emergency talks about the future of the prosecutions of the @entity78 with senior barristers and the @entity80			1
a @entity41 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity83 judgment from last week does not call into question the prosecution of the appellants concerned but considered that the jury needed greater direction on how serious offending must be to amount to an abuse of the public ’s trust			1
‘ this ruling has been very carefully considered in relation to the cases against these three individuals and we have informed the @entity83 this afternoon of our decisions concerning retrials in each of those cases			1
’ the spokesman said the @entity41 would ‘ consider the wider implications of last week ’s judgment on this case and others within @entity34 ’			1
legal sources said mrs @entity0 had been forced to consider an ‘ exit strategy ’ after the so - called media crime investigations descended into chaos , with juries showing a reluctance to convict journalists who paid money for stories that were clearly in the public interest			1
earlier this month , four @entity116 journalists were acquitted of making illegal payments for stories			2
former colour sergeant @entity118 , 44 , was found not guilty of misconduct in a public office			2
pictured left to right : @entity121 , @entity118 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 earlier this month , four @entity116 journalists – @entity124 , @entity121 , @entity123 , and @entity122 – were dramatically acquitted at the @entity126 of making illegal payments for stories			0
and in january , a jury failed to reach verdicts in the trial of four current and former @entity116 journalists – @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			0
their planned retrial in september will now be reviewed			0
two fellow defendants – the @entity116 ’s picture editor , @entity140 , and former reporter @entity141 – were cleared of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office after a trial at @entity145			0
@entity34 has seen journalists ’ homes raided by police at dawn – a practice normally reserved for terror suspects and organised criminals – large numbers of arrests and reporters being kept on bail for up to three years			2
critics have described the investigation as a ‘ waste of public money ’ and accused police and prosecutors of pursuing a ‘ vendetta ’ against journalists			1
a new @entity58 trial was yesterday adjourned until april 24 in the wake of last week ’s ruling			0
it involves a reporter who can not be identified for legal reasons and prison officer @entity171 , 48 , from @entity172			0
they deny misconduct in public office			0
eight trials and retrials involving tabloid journalists charged under @entity34 are scheduled between now and september			0

he said 13th century law was being used to haul reporters before courts
