by @entity0 and @entity1 the price of your morning latte , espresso or skinny caramel macchiato with an extra shot could be about to soar due to a killer fungus that is ravaging coffee harvests across @entity10			1
coffee rust , or roya , is a yellow and orange - colored fungus that has devastated coffee fields from @entity15 to @entity16 over the past two years , causing more than $ 1 billion in damage across the region			1
its damage has become so severe that the @entity22 government has launched a $ 5million drive to help farmers in the worst - hit regions in a desperate bid to save the industry and keep coffee cheap			1
but aside from fears over the cost of a cappuccino on the @entity22 high street , the real concern is for the thousands of small , family - run farms whose livelihoods hang in the balance after watching entire crops be devoured by the disease			2
prices for arabica coffee jumped to a two - year high in the futures market earlier this month , thanks in part to a severe drought in @entity67			1
' we are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation , ' said @entity72 , head of the @entity73			1
on monday , he was expected to announce a $ 5 million partnership with @entity77 's @entity76 center to try to eliminate the fungus			0
aside from fears for the price of a cappuccino on the @entity22 high street , expert 's chief concern is for the economic security of the mostly small , family - run farms in @entity87			2
if farmers lose their jobs , it increases hunger and poverty in the region and contributes to violence and drug trafficking			0
@entity96 estimates that production could drop anywhere from 15 to 40 per cent in coming years , and that those losses could mean as many as 500,000 people could lose their jobs			1
hard hit : especially hard hit have been @entity50 's arabica coffee plants , which produce high - quality beans used in espressos and gourmet specialty blends that are in growing demand across the world fears : aside from fears for the price of a cappuccino on the @entity22 high street , experts ' chief concern is for the economic security of the mostly small , family - run farms in @entity87 though some countries have brought the fungus under control , many of the poorer coffee - producing countries in @entity10 do n't see the rust problem getting better anytime soon			1
@entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 have all been hard hit			1
much of the blander , mass - produced coffee in this country comes from @entity128 and other regions			2
most of the richer , more expensive coffees are from small , high altitude farms in @entity50			1
because the farms are smaller , farmers there often do n't have enough money to buy the fungicides needed or lack the training to plant in ways that could avoid contamination			2
job fears : @entity96 estimates that production could drop anywhere from 15 to 40 per cent in coming years , and that those losses could mean as many as 500,000 people could lose their jobs the rust , called roya in @entity149 , is a fungus that is highly contagious due to airborne fungal spores			1
it affects different varieties , but the @entity155 beans are especially susceptible			0
@entity157 weather worsens the problem			0
' we do n't see an end in sight anytime soon , ' said @entity162 of @entity77 's @entity76			0
so far , major @entity22 coffee companies have been able to find enough supply to avoid price increases			0
but some smaller outfits already have seen higher prices , said @entity168 of the @entity169			0
@entity168 said the worst - case scenario is that consumers eventually will pay ' extraordinarily high prices for those coffees , if you can find them at all			1
' he said some very specialized varieties from a single origin - @entity121 antigua coffees , for example - have been much harder to source			2
if the problem continues , he says , some small coffee companies either will raise prices or use blends that are easier to find , decreasing the quality of the coffee			2
larger companies such as @entity187 and @entity188 have multiple suppliers across the region and say they have so far been able to source enough coffee			0
' it 's a little bit too soon to tell what the impact will be on supply and long term quality over time , ' said @entity197 , who heads up coffee sourcing for @entity188			0
still , the companies are trying to ensure that their future supply is n't affected , so they are working closely with growers on better practices that will help them avoid contamination			0
how much ? larger companies such as @entity187 and @entity188 have multiple suppliers across the region and say they have so far been able to source enough coffee ' supporting the farmer 's ability to access information , technology and resources allows them to adapt to these uncertainties and ensures the longevity of our industry 's supply chain , ' said @entity216 , @entity217 executive vice president			0
@entity187 even bought a @entity125 farm for research purposes			0
@entity73 intends to work with @entity77 to step up research on rust - resistant coffee varieties and help @entity10 better monitor and respond to the fungus			1
the @entity22 already collaborates with some of the coffee companies and other international organizations to finance replanting of different varieties of trees			0
the effort is part of the @entity232 administration 's @entity230 , which aims to rid the world of extreme poverty through agricultural development and improved nutrition			0
while the effort has helped hungry children around the globe , ' we 're at risk of backtracking because of coffee rust , ' @entity72 says .			1
