the killer ash tree disease has now been found at nearly 300 sites as conservation groups slammed the government ’s response as ‘ too little , too late ’			1
ministers yesterday unveiled a strategy to tackle ash dieback , and claimed it caught officials unaware earlier this year when the first case was revealed in @entity11			1
the number of infected sites is now 291 - and the number has doubled in just one month			1
lethal : @entity15 , pictured , has been found at nearly 300 sites - double the number of sites in one month but campaigners , who raised fears that @entity11 was at risk from the infection from imported trees four years ago , said the plan did not go far enough and would ‘ surrender the landscape ’ to ash dieback			1
all 80 million ash trees , @entity11 ’s third most abundant type and a staple of the timber industry , are at risk from the pest which has wiped out 90 per cent of ash trees in @entity33 and could be as devastating as @entity35 elm disease was in the 1970s			1
the plan announced by environment secretary @entity37 is intended to reduce the spread of the disease , as @entity4 scientific advisers claim it can not now be eradicated			1
it is believed to have arrived on imported young ash trees , and blown across as spores from the continent			1
mr @entity37 announced more research into how the infection spreads , a ‘ risk register ’ for infected trees and improved security measures at border controls			2
experts will locate trees which have genetic resistance to the fungus which could be used to ‘ restructure ’ infected forests			2
he said : ‘ we need to radically rethink how we deal with the threats to our trees			0
while the science tells us it wo n’t be possible to eradicate this disease , we must n’t give up on @entity57 ash			1
the plan i have set out shows our determination to slow the spread and minimise the impact			0
’ dr @entity69 , of the @entity70 , said the actions in the plan were paltry , and he accused the government of ‘ surrendering ’ by backing out of testing all recently planted trees and destroying infected ones			0
@entity70 has destroyed 3,000 recently planted ash saplings on its land after five outbreaks			1
he said : ‘ the limited actions and weak commitments set out in the plan will not be enough to achieve the aim of controlling the spread of the disease			0
it ’s far too little , too late			1
‘ our collective knowledge of this disease is limited , and it is good to see a workshop on research priorities is being proposed , but we are concerned that this is entirely focused on breeding resistance rather than on techniques that could reduce the rate of spread			0
’ ash dieback is caused by the chalara fraxinea fungs and is rife in northern @entity97			1
it was discovered in @entity11 for the first time in a nursery in @entity101			0
devastation : the disease is hitting one of the most common types of tree in @entity11 and the impact is evident on the infected ash leaf , right the symptoms are small discoloured patches on the trees stem which develop into bigger lesions and the leaves wilting and young trees die quickly			2
the first outbreak in the wild was in woodland in @entity118 in october , and it has now been found at 155 mature woodlands , 119 recently planted areas and 17 nurseries nationwide			2
professor @entity122 , chief scientist at the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) said the disease had caught the @entity11 off guard			0
he said : ‘ it simply fell below the radar to be honest			0
it ’s very difficult thing to identify			0
’ mr @entity37 told the @entity130 last month that he would allocate money for an ‘ early warning system ’ made up of trained volunteers from groups such as the @entity135 to ‘ play a really important role ’ in monitoring tree health			0
but @entity135 chief executive @entity138 said the plan was ‘ disappointing ’ especially as @entity11 faces a growing numbers of woodland pests and diseases due to global trade			0
she said : ‘ there is a distinct lack of political interest in supporting the @entity11 ’s natural infrastructure despite the government ’s own figures valuing the benefits of our woods and trees at around £ 1.2bn a year			0
it is clear the government is playing scientific catch up , completely unprepared for the crisis our ash trees are now facing			2
