by @entity0 follow @ @ robshepherd5 @entity1 should not fear @entity2 , but apparently the big issue from those in the @entity6 ‘ bubble ’ is how to stop @entity2 midfield play - maker @entity7 pulling the strings			1
former @entity11 boss @entity10 , now of @entity12 , knows a thing or two about such things and has a solution			0
no 1 is not to fear @entity7			0
no fear : @entity1 must stop @entity7 if they are to have a chance of beating @entity2 @entity10 then argues against getting a forward like @entity19 to do a man - marking job on the ageing @entity23 quarterback ( @entity7 is 35 ) is not a good idea			1
@entity10 says @entity1 should instead attack him on either side , pushing @entity7 firmly on the back foot , compressing his space and stopping him dictating the play			0
that ’s why @entity30 should start for @entity1 in the ‘ no 10 ’ position - an argument endorsed by @entity33			1
unknown : @entity30 could be the man to win the game for @entity1 @entity35 has been told by @entity2 boss @entity36 to concentrate on the @entity6 and not get embroiled in talks about his club future			1
so unlike @entity40 , who secured @entity42 two days ago in a £ 27million whirlwind deal , @entity39 will have to wait to pursue their interest in the former @entity46 striker			0
@entity47 focused : @entity2 coach @entity36 wants @entity35 to only think about the @entity6 @entity1 have only won two of their last 11 internationals against @entity2 ( @entity50 ) , losing to them on penalties in the quarter - finals of @entity53			1
the one previous @entity6 came in the third place play - off in 1990 ; @entity2 won 2 - 1 a 0 - 0 draw between @entity1 and @entity2 is 5 - 1			1
if there are goals they could well come from a set piece - @entity60 is 28 - 1 to be first scorer			0
@entity1 have only lost two of their last 16 @entity6 games ( @entity64 , @entity65 , including two penalty shootout defeats )			2
excluding shootouts , @entity1 have scored all eight @entity6 penalties they have been awarded			2
@entity1 boss @entity69 has said all his players should sing their hearts out when the national anthem is played , the idea being that it will somehow enhance their display			1
but my source in the camp suggests coach @entity78 – who as a player kept a stiff upper lip on the anthem front - is not convinced that singing @entity82 will make the team play well			1
and unless there is last - minute change , attempts to divert tv cameras away from focusing on ‘ @entity87 ’ have fallen on deaf ears			0
sing up : @entity69 wants his @entity1 players to sing the @entity90 owing to the hot weather in some parts of @entity94 , fifa have agreed that the referee may call a halt to play two to three times per match to allow the players time to re-hydrate			1
this could happened for the first time in @entity1 ’s game on saturday night , where the kick - off time was brought forward to satisfy @entity106 tv schedules rather than consider players ’ well being			2
it could be a long night			0
some well know soft drinks firms have bought advertising space in anticipation			0
take a break : the @entity1 and @entity2 players may take a drinks break during their game due to the heat after @entity94 , @entity2 are the most successful team in @entity6 history			1
@entity2 have won the title four times — in 1934 , 1938 , 1982 and 2006 — and also finished as runner - up twice , in 1970 and 1994			0
@entity1 ’s group rivals @entity122 kick off their campaign ahead against @entity124 in the 8pm match			2
i hear suggestions that @entity128 will be ‘ rested ’ for the @entity1 game next week is just a bit of propaganda			0
virtually every nation is represented in the @entity133 these days and @entity124 have @entity135 ’s @entity134 and @entity137 ’s @entity136			0
@entity39 ’s @entity138 , currently on loan at @entity140			2
@entity39 are set to take 21 - year - old @entity138 back for next season but are then set to loan him out to a @entity133 club			1
premier chance : @entity138 is set to play in the @entity133 next season when @entity39 send him on loan @entity146 who play @entity148 on saturday have three nicknames @entity146 ( @entity90 ) , @entity146 ( @entity150 ) and @entity146 ( @entity152 blue - white ) @entity146 refers to when they defied the odds to win @entity155 2004 in @entity156			1
it came about in response to the fact that the @entity161 were early pioneers of overseas expeditions , ‘ @entity146 became pirates and stole the victory ’ @entity6 memory in the opening game of the 1982 finals @entity165 scored after 27 seconds against @entity168 a game @entity1 went on to win 3 - 1			2
@entity1 were undefeated in that tournament but were still eliminated because the second phase was a league section rather than knockout			0
early goal : @entity165 scored for @entity1 against @entity168 after 27 seconds at the 1982 @entity6 safe hands : goalkeeper @entity176 lifts the @entity6 for @entity2 in 1982 @entity2 won the final with 40 - year - old keeper @entity176 their skipper			2
@entity176 went on to manage @entity180 when @entity181 played for the @entity23 club .			0

@entity30 is the man who can worry the @entity23
@entity35 told to focus on the @entity6 and not worry about club future
@entity69 tells @entity1 players to sing @entity90 - but coach @entity78 likely to remain quiet
@entity124 *'s* @entity138 sent to be sent on loan to @entity133 club by @entity39
