@entity1 manager @entity0 was all smiles as he shook hands with club owner @entity4 on tuesday night			1
the duo were pictured giving each other a friendly greeting as they took their seats in the @entity9 stands ahead of @entity1 ’s clash with @entity11			1
@entity1 owner @entity4 shakes hands with manager @entity0 at the @entity9 the pair share a smile and a word as they put last weekend 's issues behind them on tuesday night it was @entity0 ’s first stadium appearance since a weekend from hell for the 51 - year - old who held on to his job by the skin of his teeth before swerving an @entity27 charge			1
few could imagine that @entity0 would still be in charge after the 51 - year - old manager appeared to grab the throat of @entity31 during @entity33 ’s 1 - 0 win at the @entity34 on saturday			1
@entity0 laughed off his touchline scuffle with @entity33 's record signing @entity31 , who almost joined @entity1 when leaving @entity37 last summer			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 escaped punishment from the @entity27 for grabbing @entity39 by the throat @entity0 proceeded to hold on to the @entity33 midfielder 's top and would not let go @entity43 @entity46 host @entity44 said the incident between @entity0 and @entity31 was ' strange ' @entity0 claimed after the defeat to @entity33 that he could ‘ look after himself ’ , but @entity46 host @entity44 hinted on @entity50 that he had been sacked			1
former @entity1 legend @entity44 hinted that @entity0 had been sacked by one member of the @entity4 family on sunday night before being reinstated by another			1
but there was clearly no hard feelings on show on tuesday as the duo watched @entity1 take on @entity11			1
@entity0 was rumoured to have been sacked on sunday night as his side sit bottom of the @entity61 but at half - time @entity62 again took to twitter to have a dig at @entity0 as @entity1 went in at the break 2 - 0 down			1
he tweeted : ' @entity1 are 2 down at @entity11			2
@entity0 needs to get a grip of his players at halftime			0
' @entity46 presented @entity62 yet again has a dig at the @entity1 manager as he so often does @entity0 made his way down to the touchline area to watch the second half of the match			1
and he was rewarded for his presence as club record signing @entity78 gave the @entity80 a glimmer of hope against @entity84 's side			2
the @entity86 attacker , who cost @entity0 £ 9.5million in january , found the bottom left hand corner of @entity89 's goal to give the relegation threatened foxes a way back into the game			2
@entity0 made his way down to the touchline at half time as he so often does by @entity95 all eyes were on @entity1 manager @entity0 last night after his rather controversial antics on the touchline against @entity33 on saturday			1
could he keep his hands to himself at the @entity9 ? or , at the very least , not throttle an opposition player 's throat ? 0 - 45mins - the @entity80 boss started the clash in the comfort of the directors box , flanked by assistant manager @entity107 , leaving coach @entity108 to control the technical area			1
despite the furore surrounding his confrontation with @entity33 midfielder @entity31 and the subsequent speculation about his job , @entity0 seemed in chirpy mood , greeting well wishers with smiles and hand shakes			2
his mood would have changed no doubt after watching an unmarked @entity120 give @entity11 the lead			0
he did n't emerge until first half injury time , by which time his side were 2 - 0 down			0
his first task was to have debrief with @entity108			0
46 - 56mins - he did take his place on the bench at the start of the second half - and it took just 70 seconds for @entity0 to rise to his feet to hold another conference with @entity108 before sitting down , cross armed and cross legged again			0
his subdued demeanour continued well into the second period , though he did smack his hands together in anger after @entity136 failed to control with a clear run at goal awaiting him			0
59mins - finally some sign of life as he strides to the touchline to console @entity142 who is forced off with an injury			0
two minutes later he 's on his feet again , this time celebrating @entity78 's goal with clenched fists			0
he stays stood in his technical area in the aftermath - but with his hands firmly in his pocket			0
it 's not long before he finds his seat again , though			0
77mins - a tad more movement from @entity0 as he gives @entity154 instructions before his introductions , his conversation with the striker is interrupted though as @entity78 storms through one - on - one with @entity89			0
the forward is foiled by the @entity162 keeper , prompting a theatric arm waving and jumping from @entity0 , about as animated he 's been so far			2
82mins - having spent most of the night sitting down , @entity0 - like his players - can smell @entity11 blood as he stays on his feet , right on the edge of his technical area for the final minutes of the encounter			2
he gives @entity170 a quick pep talk before throwing the striker on in search of an equaliser			0
but his efforts to cajole @entity1 players are in vain , though he waits to greet every single one of his players as they walk off before giving the visiting fans a wave			0
a final goodbye , perhaps ? @entity0 chats with former @entity181 defender @entity142 at the @entity9			2

@entity0 shared a handshake and a smile with the club 's owners
@entity0 sat in the stands as @entity1 took on @entity11 at the @entity9
