@entity2 has been criticised by fans , @entity29 media and a @entity8 director for his @entity5 display @entity0 ( left ) believes @entity2 's miss at the end of the first half was a crucial moment in @entity5 @entity2 ( right ) sent a shot wide after getting the ball from a corner in the 43rd minute with the scores level @entity0 believes had @entity2 converted the opportunity , @entity8 would have gone on to win the game and replace @entity6 at the summit of the @entity29 league			1
' in big games like this , everyone has their moments , but we did n't take ours			0
we missed some clear chances , ' @entity0 said			0
' we had some very clear chances , particularly @entity2 's following a corner			1
we lacked that little bit of luck to get the second			0
' if we had scored , i think we 'd have given much more			0
' we 're saddened by the result because in the first half we dominated them , created chances and played really well			0
' @entity0 , a striker who won @entity26 six times at the @entity61 during his playing career from 1984 - 1995 , believes @entity8 have the calibre of squad to overturn the four - point deficit that separates @entity8 and @entity6 after the result			1
but tellingly , he did not list @entity2 in the players he believes will be key to any upturn from @entity70 's team			2
' there are 10 games to go			0
we must continue getting our injured players back , ' @entity0 explained			0
' ( @entity76 ) @entity75 had a great game , giving us security in midfield , while @entity80 ( @entity81 ) will soon be back with us			0
@entity2 ( right ) had a goal ruled out in the first half as @entity84 was offside in the build - up play @entity0 praised the performances of @entity84 ( left ) and @entity75 ( right ) in @entity5 @entity2 ( left ) takes on @entity87 ( centre ) and @entity89 as @entity8 lost 2 - 1 to @entity6 at the @entity24 ' ( @entity84 ) @entity84 was also very good and , in the first half , @entity90 was fantastic			1
' there are still many challenges ahead and this team has enormous potential			0
' since the turn of the year , @entity2 has struggled to reach the form that coerced @entity8 to pay @entity97 £ 86million for his signature in 2013			2
the attacker , who had a goal disallowed because @entity84 was offside when he headed the ball into @entity2 's path , appeared to be targeted by @entity8 supporters after defeat to their fierce rivals			1
the @entity10 international was confronted by two men in his car as he departed the team 's @entity110 training headquarters late sunday			0
one smacked his hand on @entity2 's white @entity114 and the other kicked out as he sped away			1
but fan hostility was not the zenith of @entity2 's woes			1
@entity2 's performance was not deemed worthy of a rating by @entity29 newspaper as on monday @entity2 has struggled to reach top form for @entity8 this year and has been regularly criticised @entity8 supporters were seen appearing to vent their anger at @entity2 late on sunday after @entity8 's defeat the @entity8 man would have awoken on monday to find his performance panned by the @entity29 press			1
as did not deem his display worthy of a rating in their @entity5 coverage , where as @entity133 wrote ' it 's obvious [ president @entity135 ] @entity134 has paid € 100m for someone worth € 20m			0
' @entity2 will now link up with the @entity10 side for their @entity139 qualifier away to @entity140 and the world 's most expensive player would be forgiven for being glad for a break from the pressure currently surrounding @entity8			2
