by @entity0 published : 04:11 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 10:23 est , 7 may 2013 the micro-housing boom taking the @entity2 by storm has come under attack from residents who believe they will make cities too overcrowded			0
residents in @entity8 are among those fighting back against thousands of tiny apartment homes being built in response to demand for affordable housing			1
the 10ft by 10ft ' @entity16 ' , around the same size as a generous parking space , have become increasingly popular in the city in recent years			2
@entity18 , 67 says she enjoys living in her 10ft by 10ft micro-apartment in @entity8 @entity20 spreads his arms as he shows off his @entity8 flat : even mr @entity20 was initially shocked by the size of the apartment he rented near downtown , which is roughly the size of a large parking space not great for dinner parties ... @entity20 , 36 , works as a counselor at a downtown @entity8 homeless service centre and pays $ 750 for his unit , roughly 120 square feet , which includes utilities and internet compact : mr @entity20 stands in the kitchen , which is adjacent to the bed which is next to an open closet for as little as $ 500 ( £ 320 ) a month renters can get a one - bedroom apartment and access to a shared kitchen , often with utilities , furnishings and @entity33 included			1
most are occupied by young urban singles , retirees who prefer city living , students and others looking to downsize			2
@entity18 , 67 , lives in an $ 850 a month apodment which features a sleeping loft , a private toilet and shower , a kitchenette with a sink , fridge and granite countertop , a skylight , two windows and a sliding - glass door to a small private deck			1
she is also across the hall from the shared rooftop with a view of the @entity64			2
' i think this is a wonderful thing , ' she said			0
campaigners say apodment blocks like this are overpopulating and driving out established families micro-housing projects are proliferating in many of @entity2 's biggest cities including @entity74 , @entity8 and @entity75			1
but many established residents are unhappy at the pace of expansion			0
since 2006 , @entity8 has permitted 48 micro-housing projects			1
if all are built , they would provide living quarters for about 2,300 people			1
neighborhood activists estimate that 19 of the developments already are renting or are being built within just one square - mile area			1
campaigners say the micro-apartments crowd too many people together , are not compatible with some neighbourhoods , do not encourage people to put down roots , and circumvent planning laws			1
' they ’re maxing out what they can do under the land use code , ' said @entity97 , who lives in the @entity98 , where some projects have replaced family homes , sometimes without much warning			1
the tiny units has been around for at least three decades , but micro-apartments have taken off in the last three years , said @entity104 with @entity8 ’s planning department			1
' it ’s really coincided with the recession			0
apparently there ’s pent - up demand , ' he said			2
opponent @entity111 said the projects are seeing older homes torn down to make way for people who may only stay for a few months			1
' we ’re not concerned with who these people are , but with how many there are			2
this is a massive increase in density , ' he told the @entity123			0
smallest of them all ? @entity126 , 24 , in his ' micro ' apartment at @entity128 , @entity74 , which he claims is just 55 square feet			0
@entity74 is one of the cities where such micro-habitations are most popular if they can make it there , they can make it anywhere : @entity137 and @entity138 - and their two cats - live in what they believe the smallest apartment in the city , a 175 - square - foot ' microstudio ' in @entity145 mr @entity111 , is among those lobbying @entity147 for a moratorium			0
he believes the city is providing an incentive for builders by not enforcing the normal regulations			0
builders are claiming they have only six or eight kitchens , the definition of a dwelling unit , to bypass the need for a full design and environmental review usually required for a large - scale development			0
but conversely , they are using the total number of sleeping units , 56 or 64 for example , to take advantage of a tax exemption scheme by reserving some for low - income workers			0
council member @entity168 said the city is missing out on a substantial amount of money in lost tax revenue			0
' what ’s troubling is the city looks like it ’s twisting the rules to favour developers , and that ’s not appropriate , ' he told the @entity123			0
these 300sq feet microapartments were given the go ahead in @entity75 recently a view from the kitchen looking into the living room of a 530 square foot apartment in a former factory building on @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity187 , that has been converted into 63 such micro-apartments deceptively spacious : interior designer @entity189 shows off a fully furnished 325 square foot studio at an exhibit displaying a transformable ' micro-unit ' at the @entity193 cosy and comfortable ... miss @entity189 models the fold - out bed in the studio , which was showcased in an exhibition dubbed ' @entity199 : @entity200 ' perfect for minimalists : the closet is pictured inside the concept apartment , which was unveiled by @entity74 mayor @entity204 in january very modern : a view through the flat from the kitchen			2
the distortion caused by the use of a fish - eye lens in this picture may make it appear to be longer than it is in reality do n't leave a mess : with such limited surface space and a tiny sink , one imagines that washing up in this kitchen would not be a chore to be relished fold - out everything : miss @entity189 prepares to set up a folding chair to go with the folding table in this space - efficient dwelling			1

tiny one - bedroom apartments rented for as little as £ 320 a month
activists in @entity8 *complain* family neighbourhoods being torn down
also say they cheat planning laws and crowd too many people together
projects can house up to 100 people in shared living space
