@entity1 families are being warned not to pour @entity3 dinner remains down the drain over the festive season - or face the prospect of clogging up sewers			1
@entity7 , the company responsible for public water supply and waste water treatment , has revealed that blockages in the sewer system rise by around 25 per cent at this time of year			1
and the main culprits identified are ' festive fatbergs ' - or , the ' hideous concoction of turkey drippings , oil from your roast veg and fatty gravy '			1
he said : ‘ the biggest blockage i had to deal was nine double - decker buses worth of cooking fat and wet wipes underneath @entity33 in 2010			2
we had to use pressure jetting to get rid of it - the smell is horrendous if you 're not used to it			0
‘ when the fat congeals it takes the oxygen out of the atmosphere so we have to be really careful not to be poisoned , it also gives out nitrogen and methane gas			2
’ mr @entity25 , who is now starring in radio adverts to prevent sewer abuse , believes our diet is partly to blame			0
mr @entity25 said the smells in sewers can be ' horrendous ' unless you are experienced with them mr @entity25 , who is now starring in radio adverts to prevent sewer abuse , says people 's diet is partly to blame he explained that since the 1980s , and the rise of fast food , grease has become more of a problem			1
‘ fat and wet wipes can build up right outside your front door , building up until the sewer blocks and raw sewage is spilling out over the road or even worse , up through toilets into their home , ' he said			0
‘ to avoid this , you should wait for the cooking fat to cool , pour it into a container and put it in the bin			0
' workers have previously found bullets , live hand grenades and half a @entity81 in @entity1 's sewer system debris : mr @entity25 never ceases to be amazed what can be found inside @entity1 's sewer system he said : ' we regularly come across old coins or @entity87 bullets and one of my colleagues once found a hand - grenade			2
we also once found half of a @entity81 car - we still ca n't work out how it got in there ' mr @entity25 , 26 , who has worked for @entity7 for four years , said he continues to be amazed by the variety and scope of his job			1
‘ the best thing about the job is seeing the incredible architecture of the sewers , much of it dates back to the 1960s but the worst thing is the way people abuse them and put the wrong things down there , ' he said			2
