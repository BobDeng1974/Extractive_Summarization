strong minded and individual as they are , neither @entity1 nor @entity2 particularly enjoy the comparisons that are inevitably made between them			1
that does not stop them being paired up in the covering term ' @entity8 ' , and their careers will converge further after they set up a meeting in the quarter final of the @entity13			1
their latest encounter comes around after the 20 year - old @entity16 defeated @entity18 's @entity17 6 - 1 5 - 7 6 - 2 while the @entity19 made impressively short work of @entity21 , winning 6 - 3 6 - 0			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity2 was never in trouble against @entity24 as she reached the quarter - final @entity2 reaches a ball at the back of the court with a grimace during what was an easy day 's work @entity2 celebrates after setting up a last - right clash with @entity1 at the @entity13 it will be a repeat of their @entity33 quarter final of last year , when @entity2 prevailed 6 - 2 in a deciding set			1
but so far there are no signs of @entity1 's breakthrough season being an aberration , and she will be even more of a threat this time			1
having made two @entity41 semis and the @entity43 final last year there is the potential for 2015 to be difficult for the @entity16 , although she is handling the pressure admirably so far			0
leave alone the obvious physical comparisons between them , and the fact that they are both charismatic with a fondness for the limelight , the most interesting thing is that , temperamentally , they are both as tough as tungsten			0
@entity1 takes a rest on a line judge 's chair after losing a point against @entity17 @entity1 struggled in the second set but regrouped and fought back well in the decider @entity1 signs autographs for her fans after her determined performance in @entity64 @entity2 beat @entity1 in three sets in their last meeting at last year 's @entity33 neither makes any pretence , for example , of wanting to make friends in the women 's locker room , which is said to be going through one of the more welcoming phases in its history			1
' i personally do n't know @entity78 very well , ' acknowledged @entity2 , when asked if she saw anything of herself in her next opponent			2
' as a tennis player she 's a big competitor			0
she 's an aggressive player that likes to take the ball early and dictate points			0
from that perspective , definitely			0
' @entity2 recalls the time when she was emerging , and people inevitably searched for equivalents			2
' when i was coming up i was compared to ( @entity91 ) @entity90 , and still that names comes up occasionally in articles			0
' that 's just part of the game , part of the business , it 's understandable			0
when i was a teenager i did n't want to be the next anyone , i want to be the next @entity2 , and that 's how i 've been through my whole career			2
' the two of them will agree about that , even if there will not be any @entity110 - @entity109 tyope solidarity between them			0
but @entity2 will need to get used to @entity1 , as she is already signalling that she will be around for the long haul .			1
