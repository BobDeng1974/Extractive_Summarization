by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 02:25 est , 21 october 2013 in a scene that would n't look out of place in a science fiction blockbuster , researchers have unveiled the world 's first walking , talking bionic man complete with circulatory system and a beating heart			1
called @entity11 , short for @entity12 , the six - foot robot is made up of artificial body parts donated by various research centres from around the world , has 200 processors and is covered in over a million sensors			1
it was designed by dr @entity19 from the @entity20 , built by a team of engineers at @entity23 in @entity24 and is currently on display at the @entity26 in @entity27 as part of @entity30 exhibition			0
the six - foot robot has a fully functioning circulatory system with a beating heart and lungs made from 28 artificial body parts and synthetic organs @entity11 , pictured left , was designed by dr @entity19 from the @entity20 , right			1
dr @entity19 is a social psychologist and has a bionic hand			0
@entity11 was built by a team of engineers in @entity24 and is on display at the @entity26 in @entity27 in an exhibition called ' the @entity47 ' @entity11 , short for @entity12 and named after @entity48 in @entity50 's 1818 novel , is fitted with 200 processors			1
it has 70 circuit boards and 26 individual motors			0
the ' skin ' of the robot features more than one million sensors while a functional circulatory system , including a heart , powers it from the inside			1
@entity11 's face is made of silicone and is a replica of dr @entity19 ’s			2
' the goal is not to replace the human being , ' dr. @entity19 told a press conference on thursday			0
' the ultimate goal is to provide technology to fix a broken person			0
' dr. @entity19 is a social psychologist and was the model for @entity11 because he has a bionic hand himself			2
a total of 200 processors fitted to @entity11 are powered through 70 circuit boards and 26 individual motors			1
the skin of the robot features over one million sensors that can detect touch and changes in temperature			1
the @entity24 engineers built @entity11 using 28 of ' the most advanced artificial body parts available today from laboratories and research centres around the world ' as well as implantable synthetic organs			1
@entity11 's face was then made of silicone and is a replica of dr @entity19 ’s			2
engineers designed the @entity30 to enable several of its ' human ' parts to operate without a body			0
for example , although the robot is fitted with limbs , it does n’t have a brain to make them work , instead it is controlled remotely through a computer connected by @entity101			0
@entity11 is capable of walking and can talk and answer questions with the help of this human controller , via a laptop			2
@entity11 's name is taken from a @entity50 novel in which character @entity48 creates a living ' monster ' from human parts			2
this image of @entity112 is taken from the 1931 @entity12 film dr @entity19 is set to explain more about how @entity11 was built and what it is capable of during a one - hour documentary to be aired on the @entity117 on sunday 20 october at 9pm pdt			1
the documentary is only available to viewers in the @entity119 @entity19 's did tell reporters : ' a female bionic companion would be great			0
' unfortunately , i 'm missing a few other important parts			0
' @entity11 's name is taken from @entity50 's novel frankenstein			0
in the book , published originally in 1818 , @entity48 creates a living ' monster ' from human body parts			0
@entity11 is also reminiscent of the terminator robot played by @entity129 in the 1984 film of the same name and the @entity132 , played by @entity133 in the 1970s , who was a fictional astronaut with bionic limbs called @entity136			2
the heart and other organs in the circulatory system were built by @entity140 , a professor of nanotechnology and @entity142 at @entity143 , using a specially - designed polymer that builds implantable organs of any shape			1
other artificial body parts featured in the @entity30 include a heart from @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity151 , ankles and feet from @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity155 ; a lung from @entity157 in @entity158 ; ears from @entity160 in @entity161 ; a pancreas from @entity163 in the @entity164 ; and a prototype kidney from the @entity166 , @entity167			1
dr @entity19 , pictured right , and engineer @entity170 , left , help six - foot @entity11 as it walks at the @entity26 in @entity27			1
the robot is controlled using a laptop , which can also be used to help it talk and answer questions			0

@entity11 , short for @entity12 , has 200 processors and a million sensors
it also features a functioning circulatory system fitted with a beating heart
the bionic body is made up of 28 artificial parts from around the world
six - foot tall @entity11 can walk and talk with the help of a remote control
