not for a second was @entity0 neglecting to celebrate this one			1
a goal late on to win a game that had been drifting to a stale draw against a relegation rival is enough to make even the most professional of strikers smile			0
@entity8 wants to keep hold of the @entity12 international this window and little wonder			1
he was man of the match by a distance here , the only player on the pitch who bore a cutting edge			2
twelve minutes from the end his razor finish brought @entity21 victory on his first league match in charge of @entity24			1
click here for more from @entity26 's brilliant @entity73			0
@entity55 needlessly passed the ball back to goalkeeper @entity50 , who picked up instinctively			1
referee @entity69 awarded an indirect free - kick eight yards out on the angle			1
substitute @entity43 touched the ball and despite four onrushing @entity27 players and two more on the line , @entity0 ’s low shot found the back of the net			1
four times he declined to show delight when scoring against @entity85 last weekend			0
not a bit of it here			0
arms out wide , flapping gleefully , he ran to the corner to share the moment with @entity24 fans			2
@entity24 are up to 14th with this win , @entity27 down to 17th , out of the relegation zone on goal difference			1
@entity8 had emerged in customary tracksuit garb ; navy baseball cap pulled over his head , gleaming white trainers on his feet			2
his clothing was no shock , but some names in his team raised eyebrows			0
@entity36 , @entity39 and @entity105 all started in a 4 - 4 - 2 formation			0
@entity40 ( left ) of @entity24 holds off @entity107 of @entity27 off the ball @entity8 watches on in his first @entity110 match in charge of @entity24 on saturday at the @entity29 @entity24 's @entity34 ( left ) and @entity27 's @entity60 battle for the ball club - record signing @entity114 produced another performance that made his £ 9million price tag beggar belief			1
there was the lack of pace to reach an early @entity37 pass , the absence of strength to hold up play			0
but worse came three minutes before the interval			0
@entity125 fed @entity0 , whose deft first - time touch released @entity114 clean through			1
a glorious chance , he looked anything but confident , a rabbit in headlights , and scuffed his shot horribly wide			0
@entity8 let out an agonised cry as he swirled away and adjusted his cap , resisting the temptation to throw it to the ground			2
by this point @entity27 ’s attack had been decimated , @entity62 and @entity60 forced off within minutes of each other			1
@entity60 held his groin after stretching for the ball , @entity62 strapped ice to his knee when on the bench			0
@entity61 and @entity63 were sent on by @entity52 , who now has an injury list of eight players , including forwards @entity146 and @entity147			0
had either of @entity52 ’s first - choice attackers been on you sense @entity27 may have snatched this			1
in the 73rd minute @entity63 delivered an excellent cross than @entity61 failed to meet with any conviction			0
never been one for headers it must be said			0
@entity0 was always the likeliest to break the deadlock			2
in the first half he sent a close - range shot wide , tested @entity50 from further out , and wriggled his way into an opening before firing low to bring another save from the @entity27 goalkeeper			1
but , as he explained after the fallout from his glum reaction to that @entity167 haul , goals are his occupation			0
twelve minutes from time it was job done			2
@entity171 ( left ) of @entity27 battles with @entity0 of @entity24 during the first half @entity35 ( left ) of @entity24 vies for possession with @entity173 of @entity27 at @entity174 on saturday @entity27 boss @entity52 ( third left ) gives instructions to midfielder @entity56 during a break in play @entity24 's @entity125 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity27 's @entity58 @entity27 manager @entity52 ( right ) attempts to control the ball on the touchline while @entity24 player @entity40 watches on @entity182 of @entity27 jumps with @entity105 of @entity24 during the clash at the @entity31 @entity0 celebrates after scoring the winner for @entity24 alongside team - mate @entity43 ( right )			1

@entity0 scores 12 minutes from time to give @entity24 a narrow victory over @entity27
netted from an indirect free - kick after @entity27 goalkeeper @entity50 picked up a *backpass*
@entity8 steers the @entity24 to victory in his first @entity110 game in charge
21 - year - old @entity0 the star player by a distance to prove his worth to @entity21 and @entity24
