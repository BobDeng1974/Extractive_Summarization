a stranded cargo ship was busted out of ten - foot thick ice by a hulking @entity3 icebreaker after a @entity5 ship got stuck			1
the @entity6 had languished in frozen - over @entity7 for five days on its way to @entity10 after getting trapped by the hefty sheets of ice			1
its ten - strong crew were stuck on board - and hoped to be rescued by the @entity5 's @entity17 tugboat			2
breaking free : the @entity6 , front , was stuck in @entity7 , and needed to be rescued by a @entity3 coast guard ship , back , after a failed attempt by the @entity21 battling the cold : the @entity6 , left , was stuck in the icy waters for five days before the rescue by the @entity25 , sent by the @entity3 coast guard stranded : the @entity6 , a 767ft cargo ship , was trapped in the ice on @entity7 for five days savior : the @entity3 coast guard 's @entity25 smashed through the thick ice and freed both ships but that ship ended up getting stuck in the ice itself - at which point the @entity3 coast guard was called in for help			1
they dispatched the much large @entity25 icebreaker , which has now rescued both ships from the ice			0
the 234ft icebreaker first rescued the @entity17 , which would have run out of food had a @entity5 helicopter not made an emergency delivery			2
worth a try : the @entity21 coast guard dispatched the @entity17 to rescue the @entity6 - but it got stuck too the real deal : @entity3 's coast guard then sent out the @entity25 , a much larger icebreaker , which rescued both ships after helping the beleaguered rescue boat , which sailed home to @entity55 , the @entity25 turned back for the @entity6 , @entity52 reported			1
it managed to smash a space around the ship then carve out a path for the @entity6 to make it to @entity60			0
coast guard ships reported that the ice on the lake was often six feet thick , with some parts up to ten feet thick			0
because of strong winds over the lake , ice flows are broken apart then freeze back together on top of each other in ' wind rows ' , which are even thicker than regular ice .			0

@entity6 cargo ship was *tripped* in frozen - over @entity7
@entity21 dispatched the @entity17 , an icebreaking tugboat , to rescue it
but the @entity17 got stuck - and needed helicopter delivery of *extra* food
@entity3 coat guard dispatched larger icebreaker - the @entity25
the @entity25 was able to break through thick ice and rescue both *vessels*
