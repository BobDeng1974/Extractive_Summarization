by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 11:10 est , 10 august 2012 scientists say they are now ' 99 % certain ' the @entity3 is surrounded by dark matter , a phenomenon first proposed in the 1930s by a @entity7 astronomer			1
@entity8 , who came up with the theory decades ago , believes that clusters of galaxies were filled with a mysterious dark matter that kept them from flying apart			1
at nearly the same time , @entity14 in the @entity15 discovered that the density of matter near the @entity3 was nearly twice what could be explained by the presence of stars and gas alone			0
yet even today , mystery surrounds whether dark matter actually exists at all , let alone where it is			0
the team in @entity26 created a high resolution simulation of the milky way to test their theory , and found that large quantities of dark matter existed around the sun. however , an international team led by researchers of the @entity26 have developed a new theory - and built a state - of - the - art simulation of the @entity37 to test their mass - measuring method before applying it to real data			1
they found that techniques used over the past twenty years were biased , always tending to underestimate the amount of dark matter in the universe			1
the researchers then developed a new unbiased technique that recovered the correct answer from the simulated data			0
applying their technique to the positions and velocities of thousands of orange k dwarf stars near the @entity3 , they obtained a new measure of the local dark matter density			0
the high resolution simulation measured the amount of mass in the galaxy to predict where dark matter was ' we are 99 % confident that there is dark matter near the @entity3 , " says the lead author @entity62			1
in fact , if anything , the authors ' favoured dark matter density is a little high : they find more dark matter than expected at 90 % confidence			2
there is a 10 % chance that this is merely a statistical fluke , but if future data confirms this high value the implications are exciting as @entity62 explains : ' this could be the first evidence for a " disc " of dark matter in our @entity81 , as recently predicted by theory and numerical simulations of galaxy formation , or it could mean that the dark matter halo of our galaxy is squashed , boosting the local dark matter density			2
' co-author prof. @entity89 said : ' if dark matter is a fundamental particle , billions of these particles will have passed through your body by the time your finish reading this article ' experimental physicists hope to capture just a few of these particles each year in experiments like @entity101 and @entity102 currently in operation			0
' knowing the local properties of dark matter is the key to revealing just what kind of particle it consists of			0

researchers *recreated* the @entity37 inside a *computer* to try and find signs of dark matter
believe the amount of dark matter has been underestimated
