@entity0 is still in big trouble for the outburst that has overshadowed @entity4 ’s championship triumph and faces a lengthy ban even though the man he abused does not consider the attack to be racist			1
the @entity4 captain faces a disciplinary hearing this week with the @entity11 ’s resolve to take the matter extremely seriously as strong as ever even though @entity13 appeared to clear @entity0 of racially abusing him on friday			1
@entity0 was banned for the rest of the season and was unable to lift the championship trophy after telling @entity13 to ‘ f * * * off back to your own country you kolpak f * * * * * ’ in a highly - charged @entity22 match at @entity23 earlier this month			2
@entity0 , seen here lifting the @entity25 trophy , faces a lengthy ban after his racist slur towards @entity28 's @entity13			2
@entity0 faces an @entity11 disciplinary hearing this week @entity0 ( right ) told @entity13 to ' f * * * off back to your own country you kolpak f * * * * * ' as @entity4 and @entity28 left the field at the close of play in @entity35 on september 2 now , in a further twist , it has emerged that it was @entity13 ’s @entity28 team - mate @entity38 who reported the incident to umpires @entity41 and @entity42 rather than the @entity43			1
@entity38 , @entity28 ’s @entity44 overseas player , was batting at the time with @entity13 and , @entity46 can reveal , was the leading figure in taking the case further than the @entity50 charge originally brought by the umpires for dissent			0
it was taken up by @entity54 , who is charge of discipline in the professional game for the @entity11 , and @entity0 ’s future will this week be determined by a disciplinary commission chaired by the respected @entity60			0
@entity13 's @entity28 team - mate @entity38 was the one who reported the racist slur , it has emerged @entity0 parades the @entity25 trophy at the @entity63 vs @entity65 match on saturday it was @entity67 who decided that @entity0 had a case to answer on racial grounds because he used what is considered the inflammatory phrase ‘ f * * * off back to your own country			1
’ the use of the term @entity77 , an overseas player who can play without restriction like @entity13 , bears no part in the hearing and is not considered insulting			0
@entity46 understands that @entity0 has not helped his case by showing no contrition and there has been no sign of any apology either from @entity4 , who have vowed to back their man to the hilt legally if necessary			0
yet with @entity0 , 30 , being a serial offender in dissent cases he could be facing a long spell on the sidelines if found guilty by @entity67 and his commission this week .			0
