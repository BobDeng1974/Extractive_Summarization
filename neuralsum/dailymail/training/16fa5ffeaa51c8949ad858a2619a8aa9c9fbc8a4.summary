by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 08:25 est , 23 january 2013 support : @entity3 councillor @entity2 who has proposed that permits be granted to those living in rural communities , allowing them to drive after ' two or three drinks ' support is growing for the introduction of drink - driving permits on rural @entity13 roads as a second council is set to hear a motion on the proposal			1
councillors in @entity3 have already backed a change in the law that would allow drinkers in rural areas to drive after having ' two or three drinks '			1
but despite widespread criticism of the proposal , originally put forward by pub owner and independent councillor @entity2 , a councillor in another county has expressed support			2
@entity29 councillor @entity28 said he would raise the idea at the next sitting of his council 's policy committee			1
he disagreed with the assertion that more lax rules would lead to more road deaths , saying : ' we do n't want to see people drunk , we 're only talking about up to three pints			0
' this would have to be monitored , maybe by the publican or through some sort of stamped card system			0
' mr @entity2 's suggestion that a permit system would help prevent ' depression and suicide ' was widely condemned			2
he also claimed that people in rural areas were ' travelling very minor roads … with very little traffic ' and ' have never killed anyone			2
' the motion was passed by @entity53 , in south - west @entity13 , on monday by five votes to three , with the remainder of the councillors either absent or abstaining			1
rural : mr @entity2 claimed that people in rural areas were ' travelling very minor roads ¿ with very little traffic ' and ' have never killed anyone ' three of those who voted in favour of mr @entity2 's proposal are also believed to be publicans			1
the approved motion will now be considered by minister for justice @entity66 who will then decide whether or not to take the issue up with government			1
mr @entity2 claimed his proposal would bring back a social outlet for lonely people in rural areas that has been lost after more strict drink - drive laws were introduced			1
in his proposal outline he wrote : ' to ask the minister for justice to introduce legislation to allow @entity76 to issue permits to people living in rural isolated areas to allow them to drive home from their nearest pub after having two or three drinks on little used roads driving at very low speeds - to be issued at the discretion of the local @entity76			1
' this would greatly benefit people living alone looking at four walls and restore some bit of social activity in local pubs and may also help prevent depression and suicide			0
' @entity94 has a chronic drink driving problem			2
18,851 drivers were arrested on suspicion of drink driving in 2007			1
a total of 18,053 drivers were arrested on suspicion of drink driving in 2008			1
that ’s an average of around 347 drivers arrested each week for drink driving in the @entity13			1
@entity94 is ranked among the highest alcohol consuming countries in the @entity106 ( @entity107 , 2007 ) he told the @entity109 : ' they 're travelling in very minor roads , often on tractors , with very little traffic and it 's not right they 're being treated the same as the rest of the travelling public and they have never killed anyone			2
' the only outlet they have then is to take home a bottle of whiskey and they 're falling into depression and suicide for some of them is the sad way out , ' he added			0
road safety chiefs attacked the ' off - the - wall ' motion that would serve only to drag the country back to ' a much darker day			2
' the head of @entity13 's @entity133 , @entity134 , expressed disbelief at the proposal			0
he said most of the country 's deaths and injuries from road accidents were in fact in rural areas			1
' there is very strong evidence which makes an irrefutable link between the consumption of alcohol and impairment , ' mr @entity134 said			0
' on that basis it is unthinkable that we would go back to a system that sought to increase our drink - drive limit , ' he said			1
' we have made substantial progress in @entity13 in reducing deaths and injuries on our roads , particularly in rural areas which are hardest hit by road fatalities and injuries			0
' i think we need to proceed with that and continue with the life - saving policies that we have in place			0
' describing the motion as ' off - the - wall ' , mr @entity134 paid tribute to @entity13 motorists for a sea change in attitudes and behaviour towards drink - driving that had made a significant dent in road deaths over recent years			1
' that is what is saving lives and proposals such as this bring us back to a much darker day , ' he said			0
@entity181 councillor @entity180 said she did not want to be associated with the motion			2
it ’s not caused by not being able to go to the pub. there ’s more things in @entity189 than going into your pub , ' she told mr @entity2			0
figures show 161 people lost their lives on @entity13 roads last year , a record low independent councillor , @entity197 ( @entity198 ) said mr @entity2 was representing the interests of publicans on the council			0
@entity203 , spokesman for @entity94 , said : ' those in rural areas who may be suffering from isolation will not benefit from putting their lives and the lives of the other members of their community at risk by drinking and driving			0
' we need constructive solutions to help those people , such as greater investment in community resources , and socialising is an important part of this , but alcohol does not have to be			0
' mr @entity203 added that alcohol will exacerbate , not alleviate , mental health difficulties such as depression or anxiety			0
the drink drive limit in @entity13 was tightened in 2011 and is now in line with @entity233 levels			1
latest figures show 161 people lost their lives on @entity13 roads last year , a record low at 25 fewer than 2011 and 51 less than 2010			0
the new @entity238 ( @entity239 ) limit is 50 milligrams ( mg ) for all drivers , and 20mg for specified drivers , defined as learner or newly qualified drivers ( for a period of two years after passing their driving test ) or professional drivers ( of buses , goods vehicles and public service vehicles ) .			0
