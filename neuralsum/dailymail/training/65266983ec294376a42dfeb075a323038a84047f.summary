software developed by scientists in the @entity8 claims to change images of your face to make it more memorable , without dramatically changing your appearance			1
the system could ultimately be used as an app allowing selfies to be changed before they are posted on social networking sites like @entity16 , @entity17 or @entity18			0
software developed by scientists in the @entity8 claims to change images of your face to make it more memorable , without dramatically changing your appearance			1
the results are pictured ‘ we want to modify the extent to which people will actually remember a face , ’ said lead author @entity20 , from @entity22 ’s @entity21 and @entity23 ( @entity23 )			2
‘ this is a very subtle quality , because we do n’t want to take your face and replace it with the most memorable one in our database , we want your face to still look like you			0
’ researchers claim memorable faces tend to be more interesting			1
the exact features differ from face to face , but it helps when it looks kind , trustworthy , slightly distinct and already familiar			1
the algorithm finds a distinctive feature in a person ’s face , such as sharp cheekbones or arched eyebrows , and makes it slightly more prominent			1
the researchers suggest the software could be used for job applications , to create a digital version of an applicant ’s face that will more readily stick in the minds of potential employers			1
it could also be used to make faces appear less memorable			0
for instance , the faces actors in the background of a television programme could be altered to keep attention on the main actors			0

to develop the memorability algorithm for software , the team first fed the software a database of more than 2,000 images			0
each of these images had been awarded a ‘ memorability score , ’ based on the ability of human volunteers to remember the pictures			0
the software was able to analyse the information to detect subtle trends in the features of these faces that made them more or less memorable to people			2
changing the width of a nose may make a face look much more distinctive , for example , but it could also completely alter how attractive the person is , and so would fail to meet the algorithm ’s objectives			1
it then keeps repeating this process until it finds a version that best meets its objectives			0

‘ it ’s really like applying an elastic mesh onto the photograph that slightly modifies the face , ’ said @entity22 researcher @entity117			1
‘ the face still looks like you , but maybe with a bit of lifting			0
’ to test their algorithm , the team selected photographs of 500 people and modified them to produce both a memorable and forgettable version of each			2
when they tested these images on a group of volunteers , they found that the algorithm succeeded in making the faces more or less memorable in around 75 per cent of cases			2
the first time we see a face , we tend to ‘ tag ’ it with attributes based on appearance , such as intelligence , kindness , or coldness			0
‘ if we tag a person with familiarity , because we think this is a face we have seen before , we have a tendency to like it more , and for instance to think the person is more trustworthy , ’ ms @entity117 said			2
the team are now investigating how to add other attributes to their model , so that it could modify faces to be both more memorable and to appear more intelligent or trustworthy .			0
