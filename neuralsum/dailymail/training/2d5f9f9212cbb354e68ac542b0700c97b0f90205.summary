according to the party ’s latest transparency data , the dinners were held for members of the prime minister ’s ‘ leaders group ’ who have collectively given more than £ 40 million since 2010			1

in exchange for donating £ 50,000 or more each , the donors get access to the prime minister and his cabinet at private dinners			1
@entity29 , @entity30 ’s shadow cabinet office minister , said the filing showed the @entity5 had become ‘ the political wing of the hedge fund industry ’			1
‘ an elite few are helping the @entity35 try to buy the election			1
these are the same millionaires and hedge funds who the @entity35 have given a tax cut to , ’ he said			0
the revelation comes just a week after it emerged that , at a ‘ black and white ball ’ in @entity42 , guests bid for the chance to go shoe shopping with home secretary @entity45 , and go jogging with @entity46 , the @entity47			0
the most elite group of donors are instead invited to regular , more intimate meals with @entity0 and key ministers where they can discuss politics and policy			1
the revelation comes just a week after it emerged that at a @entity42 ball guests bid for the chance to go shoe shopping with home secretary @entity45 ( pictured left ) or go jogging with @entity46 ( right ) the latest filing shows ministers entertained 45 donors – all but two of whom are male – in the last quarter of 2014			1
@entity0 also hosted one hedge fund boss , sir @entity65 , and his wife at @entity67 in october			1
an analysis by @entity30 found more than 40 per cent of the money donated by the leaders group came from the hedge fund industry , which was given a £ 145 million tax break by @entity73 in 2013			1
one of those to attend was @entity75 , a @entity76 national			0
the donor ’s office said previously : ‘ mr von @entity79 … is a @entity76 national and a @entity76 resident since 1973			0
’ other wealthy donors who attended the dinners include @entity85 , the founder of @entity88 inter-dealer broker @entity87 , @entity89 , founder and largest shareholder in small company brokers @entity92 , and lord @entity94 , the metals trading tycoon and @entity5 treasurer			1
@entity30 's @entity29 ( pictured ) said the filing showed the @entity5 had become ‘ the political wing of the hedge fund industry ’ another is @entity101 , a director of @entity102 , who told the @entity104 in november : ‘ the conservative party today helps business and construction business , not so effectively as me and my colleagues expected but it is still true			1
‘ they spend time and they listen to us , they change the law and they change the regulation , and the regulation today is simpler and much more effective and today there is real partnership between business and government			0
’ it comes as separate claims emerged last night about another industry which was routinely avoiding paying income tax on earnings			0
multi-millionaire chiefs of private equity firms pay are paying less tax than teachers and nurses due to a little - known loophole , a report claimed last night			2
some of @entity136 ’s richest @entity88 bosses pay little as 28 per cent tax on their earnings because of a so - called ‘ sweetheart deal ’ which allows them to pay capital gains tax instead of income tax			0
this is huge saving for managers who would otherwise have to pay 40 per cent tax on income over £ 41,865 and 45 per cent on earnings over £ 150,000			1
a study by @entity149 claimed the ‘ @entity42 loophole ’ is costing the @entity151 up to £ 700 million a year in lost income tax and national insurance contributions			1
fund managers are able to pay capital gains tax – which is levied on profit from the sale of an investment – because they claim their earnings are returns from investments , rather than a guaranteed salary			0
private equity firms raise money from investors and use it to purchase companies , often selling the company on for a substantial profit a few years later			2
but 38 @entity149 is now calling on chancellor @entity73 to announce the closure of the loophole in his @entity170			0
they said the government 's @entity171 allowed the long - standing loophole to continue , despite containing other anti-avoidance measures			2
more than one in six of @entity5 donors who have attended @entity0 's ' donor dinners ' in 2014 were private equity bosses , the group claimed			1
@entity179 , of @entity149 , said : ‘ this @entity42 tax loophole is government - sponsored tax avoidance on a breathtaking scale			0
‘ money which should be funding the @entity185 is going to millionaire fund managers instead			0
chancellor @entity73 is being called on to announce the closure of a tax loophole in his @entity170 ‘ the rest of us pay in our fair share to keep the country going – why should millionaire financiers be treated differently ? ‘ in his last budget before the election , @entity73 wants to convince the country that he 's on the side of hardworking families on average incomes			2
if he wants us to take him seriously , he 's got to close the @entity42 tax loophole			2
’ the group claimed that , under @entity30 in 2003 , the private equity industry successfully lobbied to have a special guarantee issued by @entity204 that its tax affairs ‘ will not be challenged ’			1
twelve years ago , @entity204 signed a ‘ @entity216 ’ with the @entity206 , which represents private equity firms , apparently clarifying that as long as a private equity firm ‘ structures itself and its remuneration in a particular way ’ , their income could be treated as capital gains			2
@entity204 denied that this was a ‘ special arrangement ’			0
in 2007 , @entity219 , former chairman of leading private equity firm @entity220 , said ‘ any commonsense person would say that a highly - paid private equity executive paying less tax than a cleaning lady or other low - paid workers ca n't be right ’			2
@entity30 pledged to look again at the loophole , but this has remained in place under the @entity229			0
a @entity151 source said last night the treatment of private equity profits was ‘ agreed by the previous @entity30 government ’			2
they said : ‘ we raised the rate of @entity236 from 18 per cent to 28 per cent so this government has actually increased tax on private equity			0
‘ it was outrageous that under @entity30 cleaners paid a higher rate tax than the people who employed them			0
