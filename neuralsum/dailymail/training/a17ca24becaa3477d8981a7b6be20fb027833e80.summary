‘ it 's the same for me as well			0
he is very supportive and encouraging of the work that i do			0

i took some time to refocus and forget about what happened in the fourth set , forget about the missed opportunities and move on			1
preparation : men get the area ready at the luxurious resort of @entity47 in @entity13 great view : @entity162 will certainly be relishing the chance to see the landscape from the roof top of the rustic building ' i had this positive encouragement to say to myself , and even though you go through different emotions during such an important match and there are times when you have doubts ' and especially after the fourth set the disappointment that brought with it the fear and all these different demons inside			2
' when you start fighting them that 's the biggest fight that you can have			0
that 's what i experienced and i managed to have my conviction stronger than my doubts and managed to push myself the very last step to win the trophy			0
' what a week : winning @entity4 was no doubt the best way for @entity2 to lead up to his wedding			1
