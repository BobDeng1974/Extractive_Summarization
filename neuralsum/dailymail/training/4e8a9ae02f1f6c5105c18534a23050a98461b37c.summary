by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 27 february 2013 victim : @entity2 , now 21 , was raped by her trainer while she was in the @entity4 in 2011 a female @entity4 recruit who was raped by her trainer has broken her anonymity to speak out about how she was left with nowhere to turn after the violent attack			1
@entity2 was 19 when she was raped by staff sgt @entity8 at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
when the attack was over , he told her it was fun and they should do it again			2
afterwards , he demanded she keep quiet or face being kicked out of the @entity4 , and knowing he was the one she would report any wrongdoing to , she felt cornered			1
' he told us that he was @entity17 , that the @entity4 was n't going to believe anything we said over him , ' she told the @entity21			0
' that we were never going to get anywhere - especially the fact that we were women			2
' ms @entity2 , who is now 21 and has left the military , is the first of @entity8 's 10 victims to publicly talk about the man who gained her trust and then attacked her			1
@entity8 , a married father of two young boys , was found guilty last july of 28 counts , including rape and sexual assault , and is now serving a 20 - year prison sentence			1
he was the first @entity9 officer to face a court - martial ; in total , 62 trainees were victims of assault or other improper conduct by 32 instructors at the base between 2009 and 2012			1
@entity8 singled out ms @entity2 , who moved to @entity11 from a rural @entity42 town , just weeks after her arrival and invited her to his office so she could send emails to friends , which is against military code			1
attacker : staff sgt. @entity8 is now serving 20 years in prison for attacking 10 female trainees at the base during one visit , he groped her and she demanded that he stop , the @entity21 reported , and he assured her it would not happen again			1
but five weeks into her training in april 2011 , ms @entity2 had just finished cleaning a dorm for new arrivals and was putting towels in a room , unaware that @entity8 had been hiding behind a door			1
' he closed the door behind me and that 's when he proceeded to rape me , ' she said			2
' [ @entity65 ] told me i was going to do what he wanted me to do or i was going to get kicked out of the @entity4			0
' she was unable to move or scream , and she was left with overwhelming shock that she had been assaulted by the man the @entity4 had entrusted with her life , the @entity21 reported			2
nowhere to turn : ms @entity2 said she did not report the attack in fear of losing her job in the @entity4 threats : @entity8 had told her that she had no chance getting officials to believe her as she was a woman ' [ he said ] if i would have said something about it i would 've been putting my own career in jeopardy , ' she said			1
' so i did n't report it			2
i did n't say anything			0
i did n't talk to anybody			0
' she blocked out the attack and continued to train with him for nearly another month , aware that the person she was supposed to report the attack to was the person who had attacked her			1
she also married a friend in the @entity4 in a bid for ' some kind of protection ' but they divorced months later			0
she told only one friend that she had ' sex ' with @entity8 , and months later she was approached by @entity4 investigators who hauled her into a room for an interview			2
' i was so numb to it i did n't even want to talk about it , ' she told the @entity21			0
' on top of that , it was two strangers			0
i do n't want to talk to two strangers about that			0
' she eventually gave them a lesser version of what had happened , still fearful of losing her job			0
locked up : @entity8 , a married father of two young boys , is pictured before his sentencing last july trial : @entity8 , right , as he arrived for the fourth day of his trial at @entity9 in @entity10 none of the victims at @entity9 told officials about the attacks , and they were only revealed when a female trainee who had not been assaulted went to senior staff			1
even though ms @entity2 went on to testify in his court - martial that @entity8 had raped her , because she did not say this in earlier interviews , he was only charged in her case with engaging in an unprofessional relationship involving sodomy and sexual intercourse			1
but he was eventually found guilty of 28 counts involving 10 trainees			0
ms @entity2 said she has decided to speak out now because she thinks it will be therapeutic			1
she left the military in 2012 with an injury and struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder			1
a military lawyer arranged for her to take a therapy program at a nearby @entity141 hospital and last december she married again			0
scene : @entity9 is where every @entity144 airman receives basic training and has about 475 instructors for the approximately 35,000 airmen who graduate every year but she is still bitter about the military and how they have failed to care for her			1
' they have n’t come to me or any of the other girls to ask them what to change , ' she said			0
' they basically have left me to fend for myself			0
' of the @entity4 instructors who carried out sexual attacks on women trainees , seven have faced a court - martial , including staff sgt. @entity8			1
eight more court - martial cases are pending , while 15 other instructors are under investigation , and two senior officers have been relieved of command , the @entity21 reported			0
as an increasing number of cases emerge , the military has been accused of failing to resolve a key issue : women being too afraid to report the attacks because of repercussions for their careers			2
moving on : ms @entity2 has now left the @entity4 and has married			1
she still suffers from ptsd more than 3,000 sexual assault cases in the military were reported in 2011 , but @entity176 said the actual figure could be as high as 19,000 , with an incidence of one in three women			2
in the @entity144 , commanders make the final decision over whether criminal charges are brought in military courts , which varies from other countries where independent military judicial systems are in place			0
' it 's no mystery why they do n’t come forward , ' @entity188 , a psychologist who deals with assault cases , told the @entity21			0
' it is like going to your boss to report that you have been sexually assaulted			2
how realistic is that ? ' @entity196 is where all @entity4 recruits go through basic training			0
it has about 475 instructors for about 35,000 airmen who graduate every year			0
while one in five recruits are female , most instructors are male .			0

@entity2 is the first of staff sgt @entity8 's victims to speak out
he is serving a 20 - year prison sentence for sexually assaulting 10 women
ms @entity2 felt cornered after the attack as he was the person at @entity9 to whom she would report the incident
she has left the military and suffers from post traumatic stress disorder
