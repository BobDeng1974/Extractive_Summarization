scientists claim that eating lots of sugar and other carbohydrates , harms both the brain 's structure and function a diet high in sugar could be damaging your brain as well as inflating your waistline , scientists have warned			1
in the past research has linked sugary foods with obesity but a new study has now found the risks associated with a sugar laden diet could have more widespread health implications , eating away at a person 's brain power			1
a team at @entity23 in @entity24 found eating lots of sugar and other carbohydrates harms both the brain 's physical structure as well as its function			1
they discovered high levels of glucose are associated with worse memory in healthy adults and could poetntially lead to more people suffering dementia			1
the new research backs up previous studies , which have shown that diabetes - characterised by high levels of blood glucose - has been linked to an increased risk of dementia , @entity37 reported			1
experts have also previously found that high blood sugar levels are linked to a smaller hippocampus , which is an area of the brain used for remembering events and facts			1
as part of the new study , scientists wanted to find out whether glucose has a negative effect on memory in healthy people without diabetes			1
they looked at short - term and long - term glucose markers in 141 healthy adults without any signs of diabetes , who took a memory test			1
the participants also underwent an mri scan to examine the structure of their hippocampus			0
the experiment revealed that higher glucose blood levels were linked with bad memory as well as a smaller hippocampus			1
@entity72 , a neurologist at @entity23 and co-author of the study , said the results ‘ provide further evidence that glucose might directly contribute to hippocampal atrophy '			2
however , she said the study can not confirm a causal relation between brain health and eating lots of sugar			2
scientists will explore whether dietary and lifestyle changes might reverse changes in the brain			2
experts recently urged people to halve their sugar intake to just five teaspoons a day , in order to tackle soaring obesity levels			2
guidelines from scientists advising @entity96 - the agency given the job of tackling obesity - said that women should have no more than five to six teaspoons of sugar a day , and men seven to eight			2
the experiment revealed that higher glucose blood levels were linked with bad memory and a physically smaller hippocampus ( shown in red ) that is responsible for long - term memory currently , @entity106 consume an average of 15 teaspoons daily , mainly due to the high volumes of sugar hidden in everyday items such as fruit juice , muesli , yoghurts , sandwiches and ready meals			1
senior doctors and academics want the government to force food manufacturers to cut sugar levels , ensure products are clearly labelled and impose a tax on soft drinks , but so far , options are only being considered			2
in the meantime , experts are advising parents to ban fruit juice , squash and soft drinks from the dinner table and give their children only water and milk			0
while some parents think that fruit juice is healthy , nutritionists have pointed out that it has played a part in fuelling sharp rises in obesity rates , type 2 diabetes and heart disease			0
a typical teenager consumes 40 per cent more sugar than they should and adults take in 13 per cent too much			2
a study published in the @entity148 last month , claims that more than one in three adults have ' pre-diabetes , ' a term used to indicate that a person has raised sugar levels and is therefore at a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes			1
type 2 diabetes , which develops in adulthood , can shave six years off a person 's life			0
previous studies have shown that diabetes , which is characterised by high levels of blood glucose , has been linked to an increased risk of dementia ( illustrated with a stock image ) diabetes @entity106 said that more than 280,000 people a year are diagnosed with diabetes ¿ the equivalent of the population of @entity173 upon @entity174 new figures show hundreds of people are diagnosed with diabetes every day in @entity106			1
diabetes @entity106 said that more than 280,000 people a year are diagnosed with diabetes – the equivalent of the population of @entity173 upon @entity174			0
each day 738 people are told that they have type 2 diabetes – which is linked to being overweight – and 30 are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes , which is not linked to weight			0
about 3.8million people in the @entity106 now have the condition and about 35 per cent of the population have borderline diabetes			0
diabetes @entity106 has called for more focus on preventing type 2 diabetes , saying that if the rate of people developing the condition continues the consequences could be ‘ disastrous ’			0
the charity ’s chief executive , @entity196 , said : ‘ it is deeply worrying that more than 700 people a day are being diagnosed with diabetes and this clearly shows the frightening scale of what is fast becoming a national health emergency			0
‘ if we continue to see people being diagnosed at this rate then the consequences will be disastrous			0
‘ as the number of people with diabetes grows , we are likely to see even more people endure devastating health complications such as amputation and kidney failure and more people die tragically young			0
' it would also lead to an increase in @entity220 costs that would be simply unsustainable			0
as a country , we are still not giving diabetes healthcare the priority it needs and we also need to get much better at preventing type 2 diabetes before it is too late			0

scientists at the @entity23 in @entity24 claim sugar and carbohydrates harm the brain 's structure and function
high levels of glucose are associated with worse memory in healthy adults
it 's been found that a sugary diet is linked to an increased risk of dementia
