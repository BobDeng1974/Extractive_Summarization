e-commerce launch : @entity3 opened its @entity8 online store today , selling everything in its high street stores @entity19 , @entity8 president for @entity3 , called the launch a ' significant milestone ' for the company			1
retail experts say @entity3 may struggle to make the kind of profits from @entity8 e-commerce enjoyed by pricier rivals , though			1
@entity3 has prospered in the @entity8 without a big online presence and is mindful of the likely impact on profit margins of the high shipping and return costs associated with such a vast country			1
however , with more and more shoppers buying clothes from home , the @entity5 firm was forced to speed up its online roll - out to capture a slice of the growing market			0
@entity3 has grown fast in recent years in the @entity8 , it 's second - biggest market , but has twice pulled back from announced dates for the online launch , blaming unexpected complexities in setting up an operation well integrated with its stores			1
meanwhile , its main rival @entity47 and others such as online e-store @entity49 have expanded in the market , while @entity51 is pushing further into apparel after @entity53 prospered with its fashion offering			0
' you do n't want to lose out on being the port of call for younger shoppers			0
so @entity3 should really get in there ' ' you do n't want to lose out on being the port of call for younger shoppers			1
so @entity3 should really get in there , ' @entity62 consultant @entity61 said			2
@entity64 has become one of the fastest - growing online retail segments			2
@entity3 has e-stores in eight @entity69 countries and says they are now as profitable as its bricks - and - morter shops			2
in @entity75 , a quarter of clothing sales will take place on the internet in 2030 , up from 7per cent in 2011 , @entity72 predicts			0
researcher @entity78 sees the @entity8 online apparel market more than doubling in a decade to $ 41 billion in 2017			1
' generations of shoppers are growing up for whom the multi-channel is a basic expectation , ' said @entity86 consultant @entity85			0
fast fashion : the online store , which was initially planned to open in 2012 , will also feature some exclusive clothes that are n't available elsewhere and the company 's home decor collection @entity16 @entity3 has been struggling to work out a viable logistics model in the country , where many shoppers expect free deliveries			1
' @entity3 is low - price , quite low - margin and makes it work by selling very high volumes			2
an issue with that is very high costs for shipping and , most significantly , returns			0
it 's a particular problem in the @entity8 , ' @entity103 consultant @entity102 said			2
up to half of fashion items sold online are returned			0
at @entity3 , a shopper may well buy up to three times as many items than at @entity110 or @entity111 place average prices at @entity110 at least 40per cent above @entity3 's , with @entity49 in between			2
@entity3 would be wise not to charge for shipments in the @entity8 , consultants have said			1
one more likely way for @entity3 to support margins is to focus the website on its pricier garments			1
@entity3 's @entity8 online store will charge a $ 5.95 shipping fee after august 15 and the same again for returns			1
however shoppers that sign up to its mailing list are entitled to free shipping			0
all items on offer in stores will be available on the website , said @entity130 , head of investor relations at @entity3			1
' @entity3 is low - price , low - margin and makes it work by selling very high volumes			2
an issue is very high costs for shipping			0
it 's a particular problem in the @entity8 ' there is pent - up demand for @entity3 online and the launch will make a buzz after the brand became well - known			1
but for a latecomer to an already crowded market , it may be a challenge to lure enough shoppers already used to other sites			0
' @entity3 will need significant volume			2
that 's absolutely key , and that is going to take time to build			0
it may take years to get to a good level of profitability , also because of the cost for the infrastructure , ' @entity103 's @entity102 said			0
@entity47 and @entity49 ship all goods straight from home markets @entity161 and @entity162			0
@entity3 's model is one with regional hubs , meaning bigger costs when entering some markets , but shorter shipping distances			0
in the @entity8 , it has built a hub for the online business , the running of which it has outsourced			1
@entity172 estimates @entity3 's online sales make up about 6per cent of group turnover , which last year amounted to 121 billion @entity5 crowns			1
some consultants said that , for an even wider exposure online , @entity3 should also sell its clothes through one of the big one - stop online shops , along the lines of a recent deal between @entity162 discount retailer @entity183 and @entity49			1
@entity130 said the chain was focusing on rolling out its own online stores , but did not rule it out			0
' we are very very pragmatic			0
we want to be where our customers are , ' he said .			0
