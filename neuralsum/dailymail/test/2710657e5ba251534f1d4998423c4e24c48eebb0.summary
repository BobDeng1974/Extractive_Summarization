the small college town of @entity1 , @entity2 , best known for its university and its inhabitants ’ fierce love of football , has been branded in the media @entity8 's @entity7 , and now bestselling author @entity9 has made it the subject of his new book documenting the explosive allegations			1
@entity1 : rape and @entity15 in a @entity16 , a @entity18 publication that was released tuesday , immediately sparked a fierce debate in @entity2 and beyond			1
@entity9 , the author of the critically acclaimed book @entity21 , sat down for an interview with @entity24 's @entity23 , which aired wednesday night , to discuss his latest project exploring the sensitive subject of campus rape			1
brave : @entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) were among the five women profiled by author @entity9 fopr his new book about sexual assault at the @entity35 at @entity1			1
miss @entity29 allegedly had been gang - raped by four college football players , but they were never charged survivor speaks : @entity38 had been raped by the same football player who attacked @entity30 during a party in 2010			1
she later testified against him ( pictured ) convicted rapist : grizzly running back @entity44 , @entity30 and @entity38 's attacker , pleaded guilty to rape in 2012 and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison @entity9 argued that rape allegations were not unique to the picturesque town nestled in the @entity50 , pointing out that @entity1 ’s sexual abuse statistics were average , or even slightly below the national average			1
' if this problem could exist in @entity1 , it could exist anywhere in the country , and it does			2
‘ rape is this huge problem , 80 per cent of rapes are unreported			0
’ in an effort to shed light on the rape epidemic and spark a national conversation , @entity9 had interviewed five alleged victims of rape for his book , among them @entity29 , who revealed that during her sophomore year at the @entity35 , she was gang - raped by four members of the beloved local @entity71 football team			1
speaking to @entity23 , miss @entity29 said on the night of the alleged attack in december 2010 , she was playing drinking games at an off - campus party celebrating the end of the finals			1
explosive : @entity79 author and journalist @entity9 released @entity1 : rape and the justice system in a @entity16 on april 21 she downed up to 11 shots of 99 - proof alcohol within an hour and soon was slipping in and out of consciousness			1
' i do n't remember bits and pieces until i had a penis in my face , ’ she recalled			0
according to @entity29 , she pushed away the first football player who tried to have sex with her and told him she did n't want to sleep with him , but he forced himself on her , followed by three of his teammates			2
at some point , she passed out during the suspected attack			0
when the sophomore came to , she headed to a hospital and filed a police report			0
but according to @entity102 , investigating officers were far from sympathetic			0
‘ they made it seem like it was alcohol , ’ she said			0
‘ that it was my fault , that i had drank too much , and if i would n't have drank too much , it would n't have happened			0
’ @entity29 argued that it was n't alcohol that crossed a line and ' stuck a penis ' in her face that night - it was four @entity113 football players			1
in the end , @entity1 prosecutors ruled that there was no probable cause to charge @entity29 's alleged attackers			1
police and prosecutors said that @entity29 had told investigators the men ' would have likely believed it was consensual sex ’ - a claim that was repeated by the players and several witnesses at the party			1
miss @entity29 also made a statement to police that she was so drunk that night she did not resist the men 's advances			2
the @entity132 attorney argued that the student was not legally incapacitated because she was going in and out of consciousness			0
under state law , a victim can not give consent to sex if he or she is ' mentally defective or incapacitated			0
' after her case was essentially tossed out , @entity29 turned to university officials , and there things went a little better for her : one of her alleged attackers was expelled from school , another agreed to leave voluntarily and the other two had dropped out earlier			2
@entity9 's new book also features the story of another young woman , @entity30 , who was also raped by a @entity35 football player whom she has known since childhood			1
@entity30 had left @entity2 to attend an out - of - state college but returned to @entity1 in december 2010 for a party with her long - time friend , @entity44			1
@entity30 said she had been drinking and was in no condition to drive home that night , so she settled in for the night on the couch			2
@entity29 ( left ) claimed four players gang - raped her in 2010 , but prosecutors never charged them citing lack of probable cause ' and i woke up to a lot of pain , and a lot of pressure , and the sound of somebody moaning , and quickly realized it was @entity44 , ’ @entity30 said			1
‘ i just shut my eyes and laid there , and that was n't , i do n't even think a decision , i consciously made			0
’ @entity30 said after the act , @entity44 got up , pulled up his pants and threw a blanket on her			2
once he was out of earshot , she fled the house barefoot and called her mother for help			0
as she was on the phone telling her mother @entity44 had raped her , she realized the hulking running back was chasing her			2
backlash : @entity132 attorney @entity184 on wednesday called @entity9 's allegations ' inaccurate , exaggerated , and unnecessarily personal ' according to the woman , the @entity71 player begged her not to tell anyone what happened			2
after she finally got away from him , @entity30 went to a hospital and underwent a rape kit exam , but at first she decided not to get the police involved			2
instead , @entity30 and her mother invited @entity44 over to their home and secretly recorded their conversation , which eventually yielded a confession			2
at first , @entity44 tried to blame their encounter on alcohol , but eventually he changed his story , saying on the audio recording : ' it 's something i did and i f * * * ed up			2
' he went on to say that he came close to killing himself the night of the attack			0
' i was curled up on my couch in the carport with my f * * * ing handgun in my hand			0
you have no idea , ' he lamented			0
@entity30 , in turn , made her childhood friend promise her he would get help			2
in exchange , she said she would not go to the police			0
but more than a year later , @entity30 learned that @entity44 had n't sought counselling like he had promised and contacted the authorities			2
during an interview with police , the star @entity71 player confessed to the rape			0
as she was struggling to push her case forward in the months following @entity44 ’s arrest , @entity30 discovered that another young woman , @entity38 , had accused him of raping her in 2008 but she never reported the attack to police			1
. in an interview with @entity23 , @entity38 said she is filled with remorse because she could have possibly prevented the attack on @entity30 had she blown the whistle on @entity44 seven years ago			1
during @entity44 's trial , @entity38 finally shared her story in court , helping seal the defendant 's fate			1
changes : the university created a small sexual assault prevention department last year and its athletic department created a new @entity244 that addresses sexual assault the @entity246 investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the @entity1 police between january 2008 and may 2012 in september 2012 , @entity44 , the former star of the @entity249 , pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison			1

the federal probe found that between 2008 and 2012 , only 14 of the 85 total rape cases were sent by police to the prosecutor			0
@entity246 investigators determined that the @entity132 attorney declined to prosecute nearly every case where drugs or alcohol played a role - even when the rapist had confessed			0
a june 2014 agreement ended the investigation , with the county agreeing to implement sweeping changes , including the creation of a special victims unit and the assignment of trained prosecutors to sexual assault cases			0
