by @entity0 the @entity2 zoo that sparked international outrage after killing an 18 - month - old giraffe and then dissecting it in public has drawn further criticism after euthanised four lions			1
@entity9 has said that two lions and their two cubs had to be put down to make way for a new male			1
but the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) has condemned the ' callous ' action of the zoo , which , it said , brought the lions into the world only to ' bump them off '			1
according to @entity32 , the new male lion would have killed the ten - month - old cubs ‘ as soon as he got the chance ’			1
after the zoo was unable to find a new home for the lions , all related , they were put down yesterday			2
the zoo said the animals , unlike @entity24 , had not been killed and dissected in front of an audience			1
a @entity14 spokesman said : ' @entity9 , which pleads that there is nowhere to put these animals , did n't find them abandoned on the doorstep one morning – the zoo brought them into this world			1
‘ like domesticated cats , big cats breed , unless you make sure that they are sterilised , and that is exactly what the zoo had an ethical obligation to do , rather than bringing cubs into the world simply to bump them off			1
‘ this callous action highlights the fact that zoo breeding programmes serve no conservation purpose , because animals born in zoos are rarely , if ever , returned to their natural homelands			2
‘ instead , zoos spend millions on keeping animals on display like living museum exhibits and dispose of them when they become inconvenient or there are " too many " of one kind			0
