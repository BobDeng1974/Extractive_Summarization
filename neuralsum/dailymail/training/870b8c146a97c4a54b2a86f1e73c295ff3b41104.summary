by @entity0 published : 04:14 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 15 may 2013 no , thanks ! @entity1 manages to avoid cakes , despite working in a school canteen if you 've had ever a problem with your weight , a school canteen - where you 'll be surrounded by chips , apple crumble and creamy custard - is probably the last place you 'd want to work			1
but that has n't stopped @entity13 , a former morbidly obese forklift truck driver who once weighed a scale - cracking 35 stone , from getting a job as a school chef			1
the 43 - year - old father - of - four started his new job after losing a colossal 22 stone - excess weight he piled on after losing both his job and his wife			1
the once morbidly obese driver from @entity23 , @entity24 , used to drink up to 40 pints a week and gorged on takeaways			1
he felt so self - conscious of his bulk - which he attempted to shroud in size @entity28 t - shirts ( made for him at a specialist shop ) that he could barely leave the house			1
@entity1 started piling on the pounds in 1998 after splitting up with his wife and mother of his two daughters , @entity36 , now 20 , and @entity37 , 18			1
he quickly went from 15 stone to morbidly obese			1
he developed the life - threatening condition sleep apnoea , which meant he stopped breathing up to 50 times a night because of his colossal build			1
having failed miserably on different diets , @entity1 turned to his doctor as a last - ditch attempt to fight the flab			1
he was told he was eligible for a gastric bypass on the @entity48 and has now slimmed down to a trim 13 stone			1
now , @entity1 has a new job as a school chef and has even found love with a new partner			1
he said : ' my life was a mess			2
i did n't feel like doing anything			2
' i could n't afford to buy fruit and vegetables so i ate c * * *			2
i did n't really go to the pub but i 'd drink can after can of lager at home			2
' i did n't own a pair of scales and had no idea how much i weighed			1
i 'd go into the canteen at work and hear people 's snide remarks			2
' regular shops did n't stock his size so he had to buy his clothes from specialist stockists			2
@entity1 , who works at @entity79 , @entity24 , said : ' i just fell into this cycle and could n't get out of it			1
i missed my kids and felt really depressed			2
' i was eating all the wrong things			2
i ate foods like @entity86 take aways , burgers , pizzas and chocolate			2
i just loved my food and it was my only comfort really			0
' hard at work : @entity92 working in the school kitchen at his new job after another relationship , he went on to have another two daughters , @entity97 , nine , and @entity98 , eight , but when that failed in 2007 , his problems with his weight only got worse			1
his weight rose to more than 35 stone , and his @entity103 was critically high at 72.9 - more than three times what it should be			1
@entity106 also developed sleep apnoea , which causes sufferers to stop breathing in their sleep , diabetes , leg ulcers , high blood pressure - all caused by him being severely overweight			1
he said : ' i was n't sleeping properly so would nap when i felt like it			0
i lost interest in everything			0
i used to like going fishing and shooting game but i did n't feel like doing anything			0
' exercise was a no - no because of my size			2
my mum was really concerned			0
she kept pestering me to do something about it			0
i tried lots of fad diets and even slimming pills			0
all they did was give me a bad tummy			0
' out of desperation , @entity1 turned to his gp for help who agreed he was a suitable candidate for weight loss surgery			2
@entity1 opted to have the operation at @entity137 after reading about the surgeon 's high success rate			0
back in the day : @entity1 pictured before his gastric bypass the long wait : @entity1 waiting for his @entity48 gastric bypass he was put on a strict diet to help shrink his liver and managed to almost a stone			1
in february 2011 , he had a gastric bypass operation , which involved re-routing the digestive system past most of his stomach			1
@entity1 has since lost 90 per cent of his excess weight and now has a more healthier @entity103 of 29			1
he now works as a chef , making lunch for the school 's students and staff but he says being around food is not a problem			1
@entity1 said : ' i know what to eat and am now more careful about the choice of food i eat			0
' my diet is much healthier , more fruit , high fibre and wholegrain foods			0
i have to take food in smaller quantities so it 's important to make sure every calorie is nutritious			0
' i 'm smaller now than when i got married			0
sometimes it 's hard to believe it			0
' me at last : @entity1 now weighs just 13 stone and says he finally feels himself , and his children say they finally have their father back we could both get in ! @entity1 and his current partner @entity173 hold up a pair of his enormous old trousers @entity1 has been dating partner @entity176 , 41 , for five months and they are now planning to move in together			1
@entity1 said : ' before surgery , i 'd practically become a recluse			0
i was n't comfortable with myself and the way i looked			0
' i 'd known @entity173 for years through her sister			0
she knew me when i was big before my operation			0
' she 's not superficial and says she 'd love me whatever weight i was but it definitely gave me the confidence to talk to her			2
' life is brilliant now			0
i 've got my motorbike licence			0
i 'd not been able to get on a bike before because i was so big			0
' i do so much more with the kids			0
i love taking them camping or for long walks			0
they say they 've got their dad back			0
' @entity1 is now hoping to get funding for another operation to remove his excess skin			1
sweet denial : @entity1 , pictured with partner @entity173 , is still very careful about what he eats so his weight does not sky - rocket once more @entity1 said : ' life is brilliant now			1
i 've got my motorbike licence			0
i 'd not been able to get on a bike before because i was so big ' back in the day : @entity13 with his niece on her wedding day , before he had the gastric bypass and lost 22 stone			1
