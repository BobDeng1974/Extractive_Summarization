by @entity0 powerful enemy : alienating mrs @entity2 , whose power in @entity4 is almost unrivalled , could damage the pm 's chance of bringing about change @entity9 ’s hopes of renegotiating @entity11 ’s role in the @entity12 suffered a major blow yesterday as @entity15 meps teamed up with @entity17 ’s answer to @entity18			1
in a snub to @entity17 chancellor @entity2 , they agreed to form a group in the @entity21 with @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , @entity24 who are implacably opposed to mrs @entity2			1
alienating mrs @entity2 , whose power in @entity4 is almost unrivalled , could seriously damage the prime minister ’s chance of bringing about change			0
a @entity15 spokesman last night said it was ‘ very disappointing ’ that the @entity31 had chosen to accept @entity23 – although some @entity15 meps are thought to have voted for it			1
the rift with mrs @entity2 undermines mr @entity9 ’s bid to rough out a new deal with @entity4 before his planned in / out referendum on @entity12 membership in 2017			0
@entity39 , of think - tank @entity40 , said the decision to cosy up to the @entity23 was ‘ not helpful at all ’ to mr @entity9			0
he went on to say : ‘ if the objective is sweeping reform of the @entity12 , for which you need @entity2 ’s support , then it is not a good idea to team up with a party that is actively campaigning against her in her own country			0
’ the decision also scuppers an informal deal between the two leaders in which mrs @entity2 would soft - pedal on her support for arch - federalist @entity56 , her favoured candidate for @entity59 president , in return for mr @entity9 vetoing a deal with @entity23 by @entity62 in the @entity21 .			2
