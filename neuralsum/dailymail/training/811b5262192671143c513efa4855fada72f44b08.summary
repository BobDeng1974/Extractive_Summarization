by @entity0 published : 19:55 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 19:57 est , 26 march 2013 the first sex scene i ever saw in the movies that left me vaguely gobsmacked was the moment in @entity5 when @entity6 performed a sex act on @entity8			1
we did n’t see the act itself , merely the strongest possible suggestion of it , but that was astonishing enough			1
for this was back in 1965 when the censorship rules were just beginning to be relaxed , and daring sexual stuff was still uncommon in the cinemas			1
raunchy : @entity6 and @entity8 in @entity5 which was made just as censorship rules were beginning to be relaxed from there , of course , the movies went on to ever greater licence , culminating in what is probably the most famous ( or perhaps that should be notorious ) sex scene — the sequence in 1992 ’s @entity29 when @entity30 uncrosses her legs to reveal that she is n’t wearing any underwear			1
that one brief flash , which defined @entity35 ’s career and boosted her to a-list stardom , caused a great kerfuffle			1
she agreed to do it , she told me , because the director @entity42 had persuaded her that this simple , startling act proved that she had total control over all the goggle - eyed men in the room with her			1
flash : @entity30 became an a-list superstar after that scene in @entity29 this , however , was nonsense			1
@entity42 asked her to do it because he knew it would arouse controversy , this being the first time cinema audiences had ever seen a movie star ’s private parts in quite such intimate detail			2
but that occurred 20 years ago — a more innocent age before the internet — and now it seems we will not be seeing its like again			2
not in the immediate future anyway			2
according to recent reports , @entity69 has decided that sex , far from being here to stay , is now dead as far as audience interest is concerned , and that there is more money to be made from special effects - dominated blockbusters			1
no more raunchy sex on the big screen ? i can live happily with that because i ’ve never regarded sex as a spectator sport			1
the energetic , simulated rumpy - pumpy of two complete strangers , however attractive , when viewed from the detached comfort of a cinema seat — cool drink in one hand , popcorn in the other — is , let ’s face it , faintly ludicrous			2
it is , in my experience , more likely to raise a grin than anything else			2
this is not to say that sex scenes can not be effective and memorable			2
some have entered cultural folklore , such as one sexual encounter between @entity102 and @entity103 in @entity104 , which is said to have increased the sales of butter — though not necessarily for use on toast			2
or the moment in a coffee shop in when @entity114 , when @entity115 simulates an orgasm in front of @entity118 , causing another customer to tell the waitress : ‘ i ’ll have what she ’s having ’			2
those sequences are memorable for different reasons — the first one because it ’s genuinely shocking , the second because it ’s very funny			0
then there are other controversial sex scenes , like those in @entity127 in 1973 when the carnal encounters of @entity129 and @entity8 were so lustily convincing as to cause a rumour to spread that , golly , they really did it			0
unfortunately , bad sex movies also tend to stick in the mind			1
if you ever had the misfortune to see that great turkey @entity137 , you will probably recall a lengthy bedroom encounter between @entity140 and @entity141			0
memorable : the scene in when @entity114 went down in movie history when @entity115 simulates an orgasm in front of @entity118 i ’m afraid that left me ( and , i suspect , the audience ) cold because even though @entity150 was @entity140 ’s squeeze at the time , there seemed to be no empathy between them at all			1
and then there was 9 ½ weeks — the supposedly ground - breaking 1986 erotic drama in which @entity156 and @entity157 were at it so often that i grew positively bored			0
and the scenes of mental violence when he makes her crawl about like a dog and watch while he sleeps with a prostitute were hard to take			0
for the great disadvantage of graphic sex scenes , whether done well or not , is that for better or worse you tend to remember them rather than the rest of the film			0
besides , in the past 30 years or so , with the advent of looser censorship allowing filmmakers to show pretty much what they want , the cardinal rule that less is often more seems to have been forgotten — in other words that what is implied can be far more arousing than what is explicit			0
reel love : @entity182 and @entity183 in the 39 steps i still maintain that one of the most erotic scenes in cinema history is to be found in @entity190 ’s @entity189 , released in 1935			0
@entity183 and @entity182 , handcuffed together — for reasons too complicated to go into here — and on the run from the bad guys , seek refuge , rain - drenched , in a small hotel			0
there she takes off her stockings and as she unrolls them his hand follows down the line of her leg without ever touching her			0
that was far more effective than any number of shots of heaving bodies , because everything was left to the audience ’s imagination			1
for that reason , i wo n’t lament the decline of sex scenes in modern films , though the reasons for that decline — money being the dominant one — do worry me			0
films with raunchy sex scenes are likely to be given stringent certificates , which bar under - 15s from the cinema			1
and in an age when the target audience for the @entity69 studios in particular is those aged from 12 up to 18 , that means a serious loss of revenue			1
these days , the film - makers argue — and this is another reason why sex is now less common on screen — that even pre-teens have seen much more graphic acts on the internet , and are n’t remotely interested in watching tamer stuff in the cinema			0
the time when teenagers got much of their sex education from the movies — because an adult would never have dreamt of discussing it with them — has long gone , and they have nothing to learn from anything on offer in the local picture palace			1
then there ’s a third reason why film producers , far from demanding sex scenes as they once did , are now ruthlessly cutting them from screenplays			0
and that is because women , who increasingly decide which films they and their partners will watch , are fed up with seeing themselves depicted not only as sex objects but often as the victims of sexual assault , as in @entity264 ’s @entity263 , in which @entity265 is gang - raped			0
instead , @entity69 executives seem to have decided we should be force - fed ever more @entity270 - dominated action epics which they believe will appeal to that core young audience , even if those special effects only serve to swamp the story and the characters			1
frankly , i could do without most of them as well			0
in fact , i ’d take @entity189 any day .			0

raunchy movies like @entity29 are no longer popular among fans
@entity69 executives want to appeal more to *female* audience
