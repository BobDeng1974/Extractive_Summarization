by @entity1 reporter cruel : officials suspect many the dead dogs discovered in the park are victims of a dog - fighting ring a city worker in @entity8 discovered a grisly scene as the snow began to melt in a park on the city 's west side : the bodies of dozens of dead dogs scattered throughout the park			1
according to the @entity18 , the majority of the 28 dogs found so far are either pit bull or @entity21 mixes , most of which are covered in scars and lacerations			1
many of the dogs found in @entity28 were curled up in the fetal position when their bodies were discovered			2
@entity18 board member @entity31 says the dogs most likely were used for fighting , and then discarded by their owners in the park			1
' a lot of people when they do these illegal activities , they ca n’t put them out in the trash because even a lot of the trash collectors will report dead animals in the trash , ' @entity31 told @entity45			2
' or much less , they do n’t want to draw any attention to the house where they ’re fighting the dogs illegally			2
' @entity31 says the park has become a popular dumping ground for dead dogs that have been killed in fights , or killed by their owners after losing a fight			1
' because of the heavy snowfall in the month of january , a lot of these deceased bodies were discarded there because it was easier to cover them up			0
also , it was an unusually cold month where a lot of dogs froze outside or were left to starve to death , ' @entity31 told @entity45			0
' this is just a small tip of the iceberg			0
right now , since the snow is melting , i ’m sure we ’re going to find quite a few more bodies in the park			0
' the body of one dog was found in its crate dumped on the side of the road			2
animal officials believe the dog was dumped their by its owner ' dumping ground ' : officials say @entity28 in @entity8 has become a dumping ground for dog - fighting rings @entity31 says the majority of the animals show injuries consistent with fighting			1
many , she says , have either bled to death or have large wounds that were never treated			0
some of the dogs , @entity31 says , appeared to be strays or abandoned by their owners			0
one of the dogs , she says , was found dead inside of his kennel , which was just dumped on the side of the road			1
' it ’s just very sad and disturbing to see			0
i mean , there ’s kids riding on buses in the city of @entity8 that pass by these dead dogs every day , just laying in the park			1
people walk through the park , they drive through the park , they see these animal carcasses laying all around			2
it ’s one of the biggest problems that we have right now in the city , ' she said			0
some of the animals found in the park were still alive , but ' clinging to life			2
' those dogs , however , are still in tremendous danger			0
at risk : many live dogs also are in the park , and run the risk of becoming ' bait dogs ' for dog - fighting rings ' the park is about 1,200 acres and there ’s so many animals running around down there , and there ’s actually some people who try to gather some of the dogs that have been discarded that are still alive , and they actually try to lure them and take them and use them for fighting as bait dogs , ' she said			1
' we were just tipped off that there are some people down there trying to feed these dogs to use them as bait dogs			1
' @entity31 and @entity18 have organized a walk - through of the park for saturday to raise awareness of what is becoming a growing problem			0
' we ’re going to have quite a few volunteers come out there and meet us , bring garbage bags and try to clean up some of the park by removing the deceased bodies , trying to see if we can catch some live dogs by setting up traps , and hopefully try to thwart off some of the illegal dog fighting activities going on in the park , ' she said			1
' the city is cash - strapped and is having issues as far as police coverage and animal control coverage so somebody has got to try to take ahold of the problem and do something			0

many of the dogs are likely the victims of a dog - fighting ring
animal *welfare* *experts* say the park has become a ' dumping ground ' for people who fight dogs
many live dogs also are in the park , and run the risk of being caught and used as ' bait dogs '
