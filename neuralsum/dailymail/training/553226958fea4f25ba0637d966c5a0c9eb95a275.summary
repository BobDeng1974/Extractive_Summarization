a happy childhood means healthier hearts and circulation in adulthood , new research found			2
children brought up in a loving home who do not go without , eat healthier foods , have friends and have learnt to control their aggression and impulsiveness have better cardiovascular health in later life than deprived children			1
the @entity16 study found those with ' favourable psychosocial experiences ' gained additional advantages that saw them through as adults			1
the study published in the @entity24 journal @entity25 found participants with the most psychosocial advantages in youth scored higher on an ideal cardiovascular health index in adulthood than those with the least psychosocial advantage ( file photo ) these included a 14 per cent greater chance of being at normal weight as an adult , a 12 per cent greater chance of being a non-smoker and 11 per cent greater chance to have a healthy glucose level			1
dr @entity41 at the @entity42 said : ' the choices parents make have a long - lasting effect on their children 's future health , and improvement in any one thing can have measurable benefits			2
' for instance , if an unemployed parent gets steady employment , the effect may be huge			0
' if he or she also quits smoking , the benefit is even greater			0
all efforts to improve family well - being are beneficial			0
' the study published in the @entity24 journal @entity25 found participants with the most psychosocial advantages in youth scored higher on an ideal cardiovascular health index in adulthood than those with the least psychosocial advantages			1
it involved 3,577 children aged from three to 18 and measured their socioeconomic status , emotional stability , parental health behaviours , stressful events , self - regulation of behavioural problems and social adjustment			0
the @entity16 study found those with ' favourable psychosocial experiences ' gained additional advantages that saw them through as adults			1
these included a 14 per cent greater chance of being at normal weight as an adult and a 12 per cent greater chance of being a non-smoker ( file photo ) of the group , researchers assessed 1,089 of the participants 27 years later when they were aged between 30 and 45 to determine their level of ideal cardiovascular health			1
it found favourable socioeconomic status and self - regulatory behaviour , meaning good aggression and impulse control , in childhood were the strongest predictors of ideal cardiovascular health in adulthood			2
the study also highlighted the importance of early life stages - periods during which other studies have proven cardiovascular diseases begin to root			0
dr @entity41 added : ' scientific evidence supports the fact that investing in the well - being of children and families will be cost effective in the long run because it decreases healthcare costs at the other end of life			0
' the knowledge is out there , and now it is a question of values and priorities			0

kids with ' favourable psychosocial experiences ' gained advantages that carried on through adulthood , a @entity16 study found
they had a 14 per cent greater chance of being a normal weight as an adult
there 's a 12 per cent greater chance the child would be a non-smoker
kids have an 11 per cent greater chance to have a healthy glucose level if they come from a healthier and more loving home
