when @entity1 was first told by @entity2 director of rugby @entity3 that he had been picked at outside centre , he thought there had been a mistake on the team - sheet			1
but such is his quality that on friday night , barely three months after making the switch from fly - half to no 13 , the 21 - year - old will take the field against @entity14 ready to demonstrate once again why many believe he could yet be the long - term solution to @entity18 ’s unsettled midfield			1
‘ we get the team emailed to us , ’ @entity1 told @entity19			1
‘ we had a pre-season game in august and when i first saw the team i thought “ what is that ? ” i thought it was a typo			1
i ’d played a bit at 12 when i was younger and played full back for @entity30 on loan a few years ago			2
but i had n’t played 13 before			0
@entity1 was moved from fly - half to outside centre three months ago and has been a revelation @entity1 has drawn comparisons with @entity37 great @entity36 since making the switch ‘ you never know how switching positions will work out but i ’ve been over the moon with the amount of game time i ’ve had			1
i ’d much rather be playing 12 or 13 than be sat on the bench			0
’ put simply , @entity1 has been a revelation			2
after first catching the eye with a supremely confident performance at @entity48 against @entity49 and his @entity50 galacticos last season , @entity1 struggled for regular game - time with the ever - reliable @entity53 preferred			1
but @entity3 ’s inspired decision to move the playmaker into the centre has led to comparisons with @entity37 great @entity36 and coincided with third - placed @entity2 ’s best start to an @entity59 campaign			1
‘ it ’s an exciting time to be at @entity2 , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ we ’re playing some really good rugby and winning games in different ways			0
we ’ve really developed our game			0
many believe he could yet be the long - term solution to @entity18 ’s unsettled midfield ‘ the other week against @entity69 we won by playing a tactical kicking game , while other games we ’ve won through the strength of our attacking game			2
we ’ve shown different ways that we can play			0
personally i ’ve been really pleased with how it ’s gone			0
i could n’t be happier in the centre			2
‘ @entity36 is one of the best examples of a 10 playing in the midfield			0
he is probably a guy i try to emulate in terms of being a playmaker in the midfield			0
‘ playing well against someone like @entity49 last season gave me a lot of confidence			0
’ while his superb feet , smart kicking game and high - class distribution have been widely lauded , @entity1 ’s defence has also been immaculate			1
@entity1 takes on @entity89 of @entity90 during the @entity92 match in october in an @entity59 defeat to @entity95 earlier in the season , the 92kg youngster completely nullified his hulking opposite man @entity97			1
victory in @entity99 tonight would move @entity3 ’s team to the top of the @entity59 table , with @entity103 and @entity95 both playing tomorrow			1
and another impressive show by @entity1 will keep his name in the frame for the @entity107 after being drafted into @entity18 ’s @entity109 training camp during the autumn			2
the clock may be ticking on next year ’s @entity112 , but @entity1 is refusing to give up hope			1
‘ of course the @entity112 ’s on everyone ’s minds , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s not a lot of time left now			0
we saw during last @entity112 when @entity121 was the fourth - choice @entity123 10 going into that and ended up playing in the final			2
there are always surprises in @entity112 year so who knows ? ’			0

@entity1 made switch from fly - half to outside centre three months ago
the 21 - year - old thought it was a typo when he first saw the team sheet
