@entity0 are continuing to monitor @entity2 's impressive form at @entity3			1
there had been increasing clamour in @entity6 for 23 - year - old @entity7 to replace the under - fire @entity8 in the national side and @entity0 are considering a similar move at club level			1
@entity3 , though , are planning discussions over an improved contract with their goalkeeper and hope to ratify a new long - term deal soon			2
@entity0 are continuing to monitor @entity2 's impressive form at @entity3 @entity7 dislodged @entity8 between the sticks for @entity6 during the recent win against @entity20 the 23 - year - old was largely untroubled during the comfortable 4 - 0 @entity23 qualifying win @entity7 , who was player of the year last season , signed for Â£ 17.8million in june 2011 and his deal runs out in 2016			1
although initial conversations took place last year , talks had been put on hold as @entity3 strengthened their squad in other areas			0
@entity32 still wants another goalkeeper to provide competition for @entity7 with @entity35 looking for a new club			2
however , @entity0 see the former @entity37 1 as the man to replace @entity8 , just as he did for @entity6 in the 4 - 0 win over @entity20			1
meanwhile , @entity40 will be given the @entity41 at the @entity42 on tuesday at the @entity43 on @entity44			0
@entity40 follows last year 's recipient @entity45 while other former winners include sir @entity47 , sir @entity48 and @entity49			0
@entity35 ( right , pictured with @entity7 and @entity50 in 2013 ) is on the hunt for a new club video i can handle the critics - @entity7			0

@entity2 has dislodged @entity8 in the @entity6 goal
the 23 - year - old has been in impressive form for @entity3
@entity0 are considering an *approach* for @entity7 to replace @entity8
but @entity32 wants to *tie* his goalkeeper down to a new deal
