by @entity0 published : 06:05 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 28 march 2013 a young beauty therapist died after developing a ' super-efficient ' immune system which destroyed her heart			1
@entity5 , 23 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , fell ill with symptoms similar to norovirus last december while staying with her boyfriend , @entity10			1
she went to see a gp who diagnosed viral gastroenteritis and told her drink plenty of fluids			0
but on december 19 , her condition worsened and her worried boyfriend called for an ambulance			1
tragic : @entity5 died two days after suffering flu - like symptoms and bouts of vomiting silent killer : @entity5 ( with boyfriend @entity10 ) had been struck down a virus which left her with inflammation of the heart muscles , known as viral myocarditis she died at the @entity29 hospital in @entity30 two days later			1
an initial post-mortem examination came back inconclusive			0
but it later emerged she had been struck down a virus which left her with inflammation of the heart muscles , known as viral myocarditis			2
in an attempt to get rid of the virus , her body released anti-bodies which not only went after the virus making her ill , but also attacked her heart muscle cells			1
a pathologist said it was ' simply bad luck ' her body 's immune system had attacked her heart			1
myocarditis can develop at the same time or just after a viral infection and is a major cause of sudden adult death syndrome			1
an inquest was told that @entity5 , who was known as @entity52 , was a qualified beauty therapist who and saving to open her own salon			2
she was said to be a ' happy , lively and optimistic person who lived life to the full '			0
at the hearing , pathologist dr @entity56 was questioned about @entity52 's immune system			2
he replied : ' it 's not a defect			0
it 's the immune system being super efficient in the destruction of the virus but the heart muscle is destroyed as well			1
' in an attempt to get rid of the virus , @entity5 's body released anti-bodies which not only went after the virus making her ill , but attacked her heart muscle cells , too a pathologist said it was ' simply bad luck ' that @entity5 had developed the condition @entity75 missed : @entity5 was described as a ' happy , lively and optimistic person who lived life to the full ' recording a verdict of death by natural causes , @entity79 coroner @entity78 said : ' it 's very unfortunate that her own body recognised her heart cells as being infected by the virus and destroyed them			1
' he added that he was satisfied that he was at least able to provide some answers to @entity52 's family			0
shortly after @entity52 's death , almost 1,700 people joined a @entity93 group in her memory with dozens paying their respects to what they described as a ' smiling ' young woman who would be deeply missed			2
at the time , her father , also called @entity10 , said : ' @entity52 was caring and also incredibly loyal			0
criticise any of her friends at your peril , right or wrong , she would always vigorously defend them			0
' but mostly she was a happy , lively and optimistic person who lived life to the full			0
' he said his daughter was a ' caring ' individual who loved animals and added : ' she was intensely caring and compassionate from a very early age			0
' my bank statements reveal a random selection of orphaned baby elephants , horses and dolphins that i have adopted over the years on her behalf			0
' she originally wanted to be a vet , followed by a marine biologist so that she could work with dolphins , and subsequently anything to do with horses			0
' myocarditis is a viral infection that leads to inflammation and damage to the heart			2
the majority of cases clear up within a week , but sometimes the inflammation in the heart lasts longer			0
symptoms include chest pain , fever , an irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath			0
there ’s no reason why someone with an infection may develop myocarditis - it is often a case of bad luck			1
many people do n’t realise it , but common bacterial and viral infections such as flu , ear and chest infections , and even the common cold can get into the bloodstream and affect the heart , explains consultant cardiologist dr @entity155 of @entity156			2
‘ it ’s more widespread than we ’d thought - a quarter of patients we see aged 30 to 35 have evidence of myocarditis , and it is the most common cause of sudden adult death			1
myocarditis can be mild and sometimes resolves itself - if the condition is spotted quickly , anti-inflammatory drugs can treat it			2
but once the heart muscle becomes enlarged , causing it to stretch , there is little that can be done and it can lead to heart failure .			1
