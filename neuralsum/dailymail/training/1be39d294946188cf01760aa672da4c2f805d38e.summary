the comments have now been disabled on the video , after the couple received what @entity37 describes as harassing messages			2
' people have started to comment that weâ € ™ re trying to hide things on purpose , ' she told the @entity61 on sunday			0
charge : @entity7 's attempts to shoo away the moose were unsuccessful contact : the moose cuffed @entity7 as his wife @entity6 recorded the incident with growing fear undeterred : @entity7 climbs onto his wife 's snowmobile to try and get away from the moose , which shows no sign of departing ' @entity73 s not true ; we have nothing to hide			1
i edited this video earlier because it was clear that a lot of people have no idea at all what they are watching , were completely misinterpreting it , and were very rude to us as a result			2
' she reposted the original video saturday evening and says she and her husband reported the incident to the @entity20 immediately after it happened			0

' seeing a moose on a snowmobile trail is not all that unusual , ' @entity118 told the @entity61			0
' people need to stop and let the moose go on its way			0
it may take a few minutes but that is a better alternative than stressing the moose out by getting too close			0
