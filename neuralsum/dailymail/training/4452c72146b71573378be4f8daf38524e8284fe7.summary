by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 02:58 est , 19 february 2013 scientists have been left marveling at an astronomical ' freaky friday ' when an asteroid the size of the @entity4 made a record close pass by earth on the same day a meteor exploded over a @entity9 town - a dual event they say had a 100 million to 1 chance of taking place at the same time			1
the chance occurrence puts into perspective how little we know or can predict about the universe around us and dwarfs the often cited 1 in 10,000 odds we could be hit by a large asteroid some time in the next 100 years			1
as astronomers excitedly prepared for the @entity4 sized asteroid @entity20 to travel a record close distance to @entity22 three days ago - something that only occurs every 20 to 40 years - other more unexpected reports flooded - in from @entity9			1
' coincidence ' : @entity25 model of the asteroid 2012 @entity20 passing at a record close level to earth			1
it passed by safely on friday - the same day a meteor blasted over @entity9 aftermath : @entity9 was clearing up after a record meteor blast on friday			1
more than 1000 were injured but no one was killed in the explosion a large meteor exploded over the town @entity36 causing $ 33million worth of damage shattering 4,000 windows , collapsing roofs and injuring 1,200 at 9.30am local time on friday			1
prior to entering the earth 's surface it was estimated to be 55 feet and weighing 10,000 tons , it was the largest meteor to hit earth since 1908 and entered the earth 's surface at 40,000 mph			1
the rare event came hours before the @entity20 asteroid passed at the speed of a bullet at a record close distance to earth			1
@entity25 were able to reliably predict @entity20 's distance from earth and predicted that 2046 it will make another close call but have no impact			2
. but it is just one asteroid being monitored by @entity25 's @entity59 project founded in 1998 to monitor worrying asteroid trajectories which they themselves admit is no precise science			2
one asteroid , 2011 @entity64 , which was given a 625 - 1 likelihood of hitting the earth in 2040 according to models published in february last year is now predicted to have ' near to no chance ' of hitting earth - something which is reassuring but only when the models work that way around			2
found : @entity9 scientists have retrieved fragments of the meteor from a frozen lake shockwave : people heading to work in @entity36 , @entity9 , heard what sounded like an explosion , saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave when a meteor soared across the sky above them in addition the space agency says there are 1,379 @entity87 which could collide with earth and believe they have only located around 90 per cent of such bodies			1
however , impact does n't necessarily mean the levels of devastation seen in @entity94 films			0
in 1908 the last largest impact in recent history wiped out vast areas of forest land in @entity99 but only killed one man			0
@entity9 has now begun clearing up the impact of friday 's meteor blast			2
scientists announced today they had found fragments of the meteor and would be studying them			1
they admitted they had no idea of the meteor 's path and could only watch its devastation			0
' it was impossible for us to track the [ @entity36 ] meteor in advance , ' @entity111 , head of the @entity112 with @entity113 told the @entity118			2
' if the meteor had fallen or exploded low [ in the sky ] above one of the numerous military or nuclear facilities near @entity36 , the consequences would have been far more catastrophic			0
' @entity25 put out a statement explaining friday 's events were not connected			2
' according to @entity25 scientists , the trajectory of the @entity9 meteor was significantly different than the trajectory of the asteroid 2012 @entity20 , making it a completely unrelated object , ' the statement said			1
' information is still being collected about the @entity9 meteor and analysis is preliminary at this point			0
in videos of the meteor , it is seen to pass from left to right in front of the rising sun , which means it was traveling from north to south			0
@entity144 's trajectory is in the opposite direction , from south to north			0
' we would expect an event of this magnitude to occur once every 100 years on average , ' said @entity151 of @entity25 's @entity152 at the @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity146 said of the meteor			1
chairwoman of the department of physics at @entity159 , @entity160 , said the events have intrigued the world of astronomy but they were , indeed , a coincidence			0
' friday was an extremely unusual day , astronomically speaking , ' she wrote on @entity165 today			0
' both events happening within one day makes us think they could be connected			0
but the facts do n't support this conclusion			0
first of all , in the time between the two events , the @entity22 moved roughly 300,000 miles , meaning the asteroid and the meteor were in completely different places			2
moreover , they traveled in completely different directions , so they could n't have been associated			0
' so there is no way the meteor and the asteroid are connected			0
it has to be a coincidence that the two events happened on the same day			0
' if asteroids as big as @entity20 pass close to @entity22 once every decade or two , and meteors as large as the @entity36 one impact once every 100 years ( a similar meteor having caused the tunguska event in 1908 ) , the chance of both events happening on any one day are indeed very small : 1 in 3,650 days times 1 in 36,500 days , or about 1 in 100 million -- not odds you would bet against			1

@entity25 declares the historical firsts which took place just hours apart as a complete coincidence as statisticians put the odds at 1 in *100million*
@entity200 space event which took experts by *surprise* puts into perspective the probability of a **potentially** devastating asteroid hit on earth in the next 100 years cited as 10,000 to 1
@entity25 admits there are 1379 ' **potentially** @entity209 ' they are monitoring
@entity9 scientists today announce they will study fragments found of the meteor which blasted over @entity36 on friday and injured more than 1,000 as 150 foot wide @entity144 was watched by thousands safely passing @entity22
