a femme fatale who divided a @entity2 community by sleeping with @entity4 soldiers to give them @entity5 has had a plaque erected in her memory			1
locals in the south @entity10 town of @entity11 said the nurse , who worked in a local hospital , decided to get revenge on the @entity4 invaders after she was raped shortly after the occupation in 1938			1
former lawyer @entity17 , 79 , now lives in the woman 's house and is behind the move to have her memory recognised			1
' but we know that she was assigned to look after wounded @entity35 soldiers and began affairs with them			1
' at first the mystery nurse was shunned and branded a whore by locals , but when the soldiers began either disappearing or dying , mr @entity17 says it became known that she was deliberately infecting them			0
' this was her resistance and vengeance for the rape of her country and her personal rape , ' he said			0
' she had many @entity35 lovers , maybe six , maybe ten , maybe more			0
' people say that all of them disappeared after the affair with her			0
' resistance : locals in the south @entity10 town of @entity11 said the nurse , who worked in a local hospital , decided to get revenge on the @entity4 invaders after she was raped shortly after the occupation 1938 @entity35 troops rolled into @entity11 right at the start of the @entity62 , after the @entity63 had already annexed various partly @entity35 - speaking regions of what was then @entity65 - known as the @entity67 - a year earlier			1
by proclamation of @entity69 , the entire western half of the country - the @entity2 side - was renamed the @entity73			0
while their government continued its formal existence , the @entity2 ' @entity4 rulers quickly set about mobilising the population for labour to aid the @entity35 war effort			2
the @entity80 meanwhile set about dismantling the @entity2 intelligentsia and middle class according to a plan to eventually eradicate the @entity2 national identity through assimilation and deportation			1
it was the @entity80 who eventually got to @entity11 's mystery nurse , after they sent an agent to find out what was happening to their soldiers in the town			1
mr @entity17 said : ' the @entity80 noticed that these people were disappearing and sent a secret agent to the hospital , ' he uncovered what she was up to and had her shot			2
' @entity69 in @entity101 in 1939 : by proclamation of @entity69 , the entire western half of @entity65 was renamed the @entity73 and was directly ruled by @entity35 officials regional historian and curator of the museum in @entity108 said : ' the woman is historically unrecognised with no known documents mentioning her , but several people remember her story and opinion is divided			2
' some say she was a slut and spread sexually transmitted diseases among @entity35 officers ; others say she was a real patriot who was raped and infected by the @entity63 and she decided to get her revenge			2
' but mr @entity17 is clear what he thinks			0
' i am really sorry that she died anonymously , i think she was a hero			0
' and that 's why we have made this memorial plaque to her and placed it on the wall of the house			0

an *ex-lawyer* who now lives in *unnamed* woman 's house *campaigned* to set up the memorial
nurse was assigned to look after sick @entity35 soldiers in hospital in south @entity10 town of @entity11
instead she started affairs with them and infected them with an @entity5
