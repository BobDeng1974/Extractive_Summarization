@entity0 , head of @entity1 , confirmed the allegations , and said any players found guilty will face serious consequences a @entity6 football team has been forced to fold after players were accused of singing ' we 're racist and that 's the way we like it ' in a changing room while a black referee was nearby			1
@entity13 have disbanded after they were allegedly caught singing the chant , the same one the @entity16 supporters were recorded shouting on the @entity17 last month			1
the players are said to have begun the chant while in the changing rooms of @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , while a black referee was getting changed next door			1
the official was so shaken by the incident that he called for a league official to provide support during the @entity30 match against @entity31 last month			1
the @entity31 won 3 - 1 but the result has since been declared as void			2
last month @entity16 supporters were filmed in @entity35 , where their team were playing @entity37 in the @entity38 , bellowing the same song , while stopping a black man from boarding a busy @entity17 train			1
@entity1 yesterday confirmed the accusations , which flies in the face of the league 's mission statement			1
the league was formed in 1979 ' to enable @entity6 and @entity48 men alike to participate in a capably organised league in a manner , both on and off the field of play , that is morally , decently and ethically sound of action and speech and is honouring to the name of @entity58 '			1
@entity1 discipline manager @entity0 said individuals found guilty of racism will face serious consequences			1
any fine imposed will be divided up among individual players and club officials			1
mr @entity0 , an experienced referee himself , said : ' incidents such as the one alleged here will not be tolerated , they will not be tolerated at all			1
' they have no place in the game or our society			2
we have witnessed a rise in race and gender - related complaints			0
' that does not mean more are taking place , it means individuals have more confidence in the way we tackle the issue and are coming forward			0
' we will continue to prove that confidence is justified by hitting culprits hard , very hard indeed			0
' on its website , the league wrote : ' following discussions between the @entity30 and @entity13 , we can confirm that they have left the @entity30 with immediate effect			2
@entity89 , which has historic associations with @entity91 ( pictured ) , has now left the @entity30 ' all @entity30 records will be expunged for this season regarding @entity95 matches that they played in			0
fixtures and league tables have already been adjusted accordingly			2
' league secretary @entity99 said : ' i spoke to the club and they did agree that it was not acceptable			2
from a @entity6 point of view , it has no place in football and no place in society			0
' we both agreed that the club 's position in the league was untenable			1
they immediately folded the club			0
' the 54 - year - old declined to go into detail about the incident , but admitted : ' something did happen on the day which is now the subject of @entity1 disciplinary procedure			1
' the referee did go into the dressing room and say it was not acceptable			0
' he has thanked the league for the support offered on the day and the support that followed			2
he is staying with us			0
we are honest and straightforward			0
the players were alleged to have used the same racist chant @entity16 supports were filmed using while pushing a black man off the @entity17 last month ' it is a shame that the good work - we have raised Â£ 14,000 in 10 years for charity - does n't get reported , but this does			1
' a @entity13 supporter , who does not wish to be named , argued the controversy has been blown out of proportion			0
he said : ' as i understand it , a player was trying to explain what he 'd seen on @entity145			0
' @entity146 , of @entity91 , said his organisation has had no involvement with the football club for a number of years			0
he said : ' historically , there was some involvement , but not now			0
there is no one from here who plays for the team or runs it			0
