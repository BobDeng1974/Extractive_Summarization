by @entity0 this is the vintage @entity2 limousine which has been gathering dust in a @entity5 hotel car park for over a decade after failing to start for prince @entity6 during a royal trip to @entity8			1
the rare and valuable vehicle was supposed to ferry the @entity6 around after he arrived in the city for a key @entity12 meeting in 2001			1
but it was abandoned in disgrace after refusing to start for the visit and according to the hotel 's car park manager nobody has wanted anything to do with it since			1
disgraced : gathering dust in a @entity8 car park , this vintage @entity2 limousine is said to have been abandoned by the @entity22 consulate after failing to start for prince @entity6 the rare and valuable vehicle was supposed to ferry the @entity6 around after he arrived in the city for a key @entity12 meeting in 2001 according to @entity27 officials and the managers of the car park underneath the hotel , the vintage @entity25 420 is the property of the @entity31			1
and they say that despite writing to them on several occasions , the embassy in the capital @entity8 had ignored the correspondence and were apparently refusing to have anything to do with the car			2
as a result car park managers now say that they have applied to the court to have the car declared as their property , and say that they plan to put it on display alongside another abandoned car from the same period that had also been left in the car park , a rusting @entity51 @entity50			1
like the @entity2 , the @entity52 was used by senior @entity51 officials also on state visits			0
car park manager @entity55 , 42 , said : ' when my company took over the car park the car was already there and the old owner told us it had been there ever since it failed to start properly during the royal visit '			2
taxi please : prince @entity6 , the then president of @entity12 , is seen during his official visit to @entity8 in 2001 for which the @entity2 refused to start mr @entity55 said that apparently there had been a big fuss about the fact that the official car had been checked properly to make sure it was working , and that after that nobody wanted to have anything to do with it			2
' nobody wanted to admit it was their responsibility			0
our records show it belongs to the @entity31 and we made several requests to them to either collect it or officially hand it over to us as they owe us a lot of money for parking it all this time , but we have had no reply			0
' i guess it was pretty embarrassing when a @entity2 arranged for the royal visit turned out to have broken down considering it was supposed to be a showcase for @entity22 motoring expertise			0
' ownership bid : car park managers now say that they have applied to the court to have the car declared as their property mystery : when contacted for a statement a spokesman for the @entity31 in @entity8 denied that the car was theirs when contacted for a statement a spokesman for the @entity31 in @entity8 denied that the car was theirs , saying : ' the @entity31 in @entity8 does not own , according to its records , a vintage car along the lines of the technical features you describe			1
' and according to officials in the @entity22 , although the royal family has three such cars still at its disposal , none of them is listed as being in a hotel in @entity8			2
with the @entity22 embassy denying ownership of the car that the @entity5 say is their property , it means that the legal bid to take over ownership is unlikely to be contested , and the garage owners will find themselves the new owners of a rare vintage car even if it never worked properly			1
the license plates were apparently removed or stolen years ago and the original tyres are flat , but nevertheless the @entity25 420 is not only rare but also extremely valuable			0
only 4,116 units were produced between 1968 - 1992 and it was the car of choice for the various lavish receptions of the @entity22 royal family for years			0
with a length of over 12 foot and weighing more than two tons , the models are equipped with a huge 4.2 liter petrol engine capable of delivering 245 horsepower , that made it a favourite not just with the @entity22 royal family but also with many other heads of state			0
a similar vehicle which once belonged to the prince of @entity144 is currently listed for a sale on a classic car website for Â£ 35,000 .			0

@entity148 has been left in @entity8 hotel car park since 2001
it was *due* to ferry the prince around the city during trip for @entity12 meeting
but it would *n't* start and has been abandoned in disgrace
car park owners have applied for the vehicle to be declared their property
@entity22 embassy in @entity5 denies that the car ever belonged to them
