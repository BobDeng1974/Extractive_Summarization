by @entity0 getting dressed up is part of the @entity3 experience and the likes of @entity5 , @entity6 and , of course , the @entity8 , are perfect examples of how to dress appropriately for the event			1
but it seems that one guest did n't pay attention			0
@entity14 star @entity15 turned up to the annual racing event wearing a blue and white flapper - style dress that was made out of what appeared to be betting slips			1
the @entity22 dancer was asked to change and was escorted away from the event by a member of security , who covered her with a black blazer			1
but things soon took a turn for the worse no entry ! @entity15 , who wore a dress made from coral betting slips , was led away from the event because her outfit did n't conform to the strict dress code well that 's embarrassing ! the @entity14 star was even covered up with a large blazer by the security guard who led her away from the prestigious event awkward ! the @entity22 dancer was lead away with a blazer covering her betting slip dress but still had a smile on her face it appears that the dancer 's fashion faux pas may well have been a pr stunt for betting site @entity55 , whose betting slips her dress was made out of			1
the dancer was escorted away for contravening the @entity3 dress code regulations , which have tightened up of late			1
in a bid to reintroduce style befitting such a prestigious event , which kicked off yesterday and runs until the 21st , the bosses at @entity3 introduced stricter dress code regulations in 2012 and they 're still going strong			1
' a day at @entity3 is very special and dressing accordingly is an important part of the experience , ' states the guide			0
if you 're lucky enough to snag a seat in the @entity71 , you 're reminded that dresses and skirts should be of ' modest length ' - defined as falling just above the knee or longer - and should have straps of one inch or greater			0
it must be a stunt ! @entity15 poses for photographers before being escorted away by security out she goes ! @entity15 hides behind the security guard as she walks away hats are , of course , compulsory but a headpiece which has a base of 4 inches ( 10cm ) or more in diameter is acceptable as an alternative and fascinators are strictly forbidden			1
ladies within the main @entity91 enclosure are encouraged to dress in a manner as ' befits a formal occasion ' - that translates as wearing a hat at all times , banning strapless dresses and concealing your midriff			1
before the event , the excited 36 - year - old tweeted : ' on my way to @ @entity103 ! ! wearing a fantastic creation by @ bendelisi ! ! ' the dancer discarded her @entity107 - designed betting slip dress and was later seen wearing a different outfit , this time one which conformed to the rules			1
@entity55 ’s @entity111 said : ' our betting slip dress combines the best bits of a day out at @entity3 – fabulous fashion and having a cheeky punt			1
and although , she had a false start , she quickly changed into a new outfit which adhered to the strict dress code			2
' a spokesperson for @entity15 said : ' @entity15 was n't asked to leave @entity3			0
' it was always her intention to change her dress and she is still at @entity3 enjoying the hospitality at the races			2
' much better ! the dancer was later seen in a more appropriate outfit , lucky she packed a spare dress then ! not again ! @entity15 really failed to comprehend today 's dress code when she took off her blazer to reveal a spaghetti strapped dress a day at @entity3 is very special and dressing accordingly is an important part of the experience			2
