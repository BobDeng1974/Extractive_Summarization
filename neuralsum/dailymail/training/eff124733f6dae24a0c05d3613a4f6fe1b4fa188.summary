by @entity1 reporter published : 03:47 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 05:25 est , 23 june 2012 @entity3 's new finance minister was rushed to hospital today after fainting - as eurozone leaders agreed to push for a € 130billion growth package at next week 's key @entity8 summit			0
@entity9 , 65 , was taken to a private @entity11 hospital where he is undergoing tests and is likely to be under observation for at least two or three days			0
the incident came as the leaders of @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 met in @entity20 to find a way to pull @entity22 out of its crippling debt crisis			1
now hospitalised : this photograph , taken on thursday , shows @entity3 finance minister @entity9 attending the new @entity27 's first cabinet meeting at the @entity28 in @entity11 @entity18 prime minister @entity29 said the message the four leaders wanted to come out of next week 's @entity8 summit is that the euro will survive			2
he said : ' we expect the conclusions of the @entity8 summit will be more solid and credible compared with previous summits as far as growth is concerned			0
' @entity17 chancellor @entity39 , @entity16 president @entity40 , @entity19 prime minister @entity41 and @entity29 also want the june 28 - 29 summit to come up with a ' clear medium - and long - term vision for greater integration ' in the eurozone , he said			1
finally , next week 's summit should ' put at ease the financial markets expectations ' , he said before shifting into @entity49 from @entity18 to add ' that the euro is here to stay and we all mean it			2
' at odds : @entity17 chancellor @entity39 ( left ) and @entity16 president @entity40 ( right ) disagree over how the eurozone should proceed it has seen world markets dip			1
the @entity57 is 0.93 per cent down at 5,514.61 ; @entity17 's @entity58 is 0.93 per cent down at 6,284.31 ; and @entity16 's @entity59 is 0.50 per cent down at 3,098.75			1
@entity29 had earlier said next week 's summit was a ' defining moment ' and that , without it being a success , @entity18 and @entity19 may be pushed closer to eventually needing sovereign bailouts			1
he added : ' a large part of @entity22 would find itself having to continue to put up with very high interest rates that would then impact on the states and also indirectly on firms			0
' this is the direct opposite of what is needed for economic growth			0
' @entity17 chancellor @entity39 had been expected to resist any pressure from @entity29 , @entity16 president @entity40 and @entity19 prime minister @entity41 for less stringent eurozone fiscal policies or the issuance of common eurozone bonds			1
but after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers late last night , @entity76 chief @entity75 demanded rapid progress on a number of other fronts , raising the heat on @entity39			2
respite : dangerously high borrowing costs for @entity19 and @entity18 have eased a little on market hopes for policy initiatives at the @entity88 summit on june 28/29 @entity75 said a banking union was a top priority , alongside fiscal union and the principle of mutualising debt			1
@entity17 refuses to countenance common bond issuance and will not soften until economic union is complete			2
it is also opposed to the early introduction of a bloc - wide bank deposit guarantee scheme			0
while @entity19 's needs are most pressing - its medium term borrowing costs hit a euro era high at auction yesterday - the political stakes may be higher for @entity18 's unelected technocrat prime minister , @entity29			1
with his popularity sinking , the parties that back @entity29 in parliament are increasingly reluctant to support his reform proposals at home , but demand he get results in the @entity22 arena to ease the pressure on @entity18 's recession - bound economy			1
' @entity29 knows he has to get his ducks in a row on the @entity22 side so he can tell the parties that he 's sorted that part out , and now it 's their turn to help sort out @entity18 , ' said @entity124 , politics professor at the @entity125 in @entity20			1
' friday 's summit is important for @entity29 in symbolic terms because it shows @entity18 that he is centre - stage			2
' though hugely popular when he came to office in november , his approval rating has halved as tax hikes and pension cuts exacerbated an already severe recession , and his labour reform estranged both unions and the business establishment			0
but for the markets , @entity29 remains the man most likely to tackle @entity18 's debt mountain and uncompetitiveness.if he comes under serious threat , @entity18 could quickly supplant @entity19 as the euro zone 's main flashpoint			1
warm welcome : @entity145 's chancellor of the exchequer @entity144 ( left ) kisses @entity147 economy minister @entity146 ( right ) during the finance ministers meeting today @entity29 's hand was weakened by comments on wednesday by his predecessor , @entity152 , who said the prospect of @entity18 quitting the euro was ' not blasphemy ' and that he failed to understand why it would hurt @entity18 's economy			2
@entity152 's @entity158 is one of the two main groups that guarantee @entity29 a majority in parliament			0
' the best that @entity29 and @entity41 will get from @entity39 at this meeting is talk , ' said @entity166 of @entity167			0
crucial : @entity18 prime minister @entity29 ( right ) has said the summits are a ' defining moment ' however , with 10 - year @entity19 bond yields having already fallen by more than 0.7 percentage points from recent highs , he said that ahead of next week 's summit even vaguely supportive comments from @entity39 may be enough to underpin the market			1
the two hour meeting will start at 12noon			0
it will be followed by a joint news conference by the four leaders			0
no joint statement is expected			0
@entity29 , who presents himself as a mediator between @entity16 and @entity17 , has insisted for months that the eurozone must temper the @entity17 - led austerity drive with measures to foster growth			1
that position is shared by @entity40 and @entity41 , but when the @entity18 leader has tried to transform his pro-growth rhetoric into policy prescriptions for the eurozone his ideas have generally met a cool response from @entity39			1
he proposed on the sidelines of this week 's @entity195 summit using the eurozone 's rescue funds to buy the bonds of @entity19 and @entity18 in the secondary market to bring down their borrowing costs			2
@entity29 will raise it again in @entity20			0
@entity19 's foreign minister @entity202 called the idea ' intelligent '			0
but @entity39 played down the plan , which investors said might be counter-productive unless the @entity206 stepped in decisively in support			0
other proposals from @entity29 , such as stripping some forms of public investment from budget deficit calculations , or commonly issued euro zone bonds , are also broadly supported by @entity16 and @entity19 but opposed by @entity17 , at least for now			1
@entity213 is on : @entity76 chief @entity75 has demanded rapid progress on a number of other fronts			0

leaders of @entity17 , @entity16 , @entity18 and @entity19 met at 12noon in @entity20
@entity16 , @entity18 and @entity19 were expected to pressure @entity39 to ease measures
