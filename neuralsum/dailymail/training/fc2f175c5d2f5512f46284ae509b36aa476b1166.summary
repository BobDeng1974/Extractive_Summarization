by @entity0 when renowned @entity3 primatologist @entity2 was murdered in 1985 the mountain gorillas population was estimated to be as low as 250 animals in the wild			2
dr @entity2 , who dedicated her life to saving the species , was found face - up on the floor of her cabin in the forest , having been bludgeoned with a machete			0
as well as inspiring the @entity16 - nominated movie @entity14 , her life 's work also gave rise to the @entity18 , who nearly 30 years later have contributed greatly to bringing the species back from the brink of extinction			0
the international team of veterinarians operates in the heart of @entity26 , treating maimed and critically ill gorillas in @entity28 , @entity29 , and the @entity30			1
their work extends beyond wild gorilla health care : the gorilla doctors treat infants orphaned by poachers , conduct wildlife disease surveillance to look for emerging pandemic threats , and provide health care and medicine to over 2,000 national park workers and their family members			1
the veterinary team intervenes when the gentle giants are trapped in poacher 's snares , exhibiting symptoms of potentially fatal human viruses.and suffering from life - threatening trauma resulting from conflict amongst and between gorilla groups			2
‘ this is the most challenging job i have ever had , but also the most rewarding , ’ said @entity3 dr @entity64 , the @entity18 regional manager			0
‘ i visited @entity29 in 1985 when i was a primate keeper at the @entity66 in @entity67			1
i was lucky enough to meet @entity2 and saw mountain gorillas for the first time during that visit			2
aid : the @entity18 ' work continues to see the mountain gorilla population rise happy : @entity75 with her favourite carer @entity78 at the @entity79 , @entity30 , in may 2014 the great outdoors : lowland gorillas relax in the forest in the wild in @entity84 , @entity30 ‘ i fell in love and always dreamed of returning to @entity29 and working in gorilla conservation			1
’ ‘ much of my job consists of reporting , accounting , and meeting with partners , government officials and donors but i still love it when i get to be a clinical veterinarian			0
’ ' this is the most challenging job i have ever had , but also the most rewarding ' dr @entity64 , @entity18 regional manager empowering local doctors is an important objective within the organisation			2
dr @entity64 is the only expatriate veterinarian on the ground - the majority of the team is comprised of @entity29 , @entity28 , and @entity30 veterinarians and all support staff are @entity108			1
the @entity18 ' work continues to see the mountain gorilla population rise , while all other monitored populations of great apes around the world are steadily declining			0
the last six years have seen the vets and scientists employ increasingly advanced techniques , which they hope will help all critically endangered species , not just gorillas			2
gorilla doctors operates under a ' @entity121 ' approach to conserving the species , which live in the @entity123 in @entity28 and the @entity124 , which straddles the borders of @entity29 , @entity28 and @entity30			1
assistance : a team from the gorilla doctors transfer a gorilla named @entity130 in a crate across a river in @entity133 , @entity30 transfer : the gorilla doctors carry a crate holding @entity130 the gorilla in @entity138 , @entity30 working hard : all other monitored populations of great apes around the world are steadily declining ' @entity121 ' is a belief that the health of one species is inextricably linked to that of the entire ecosystem - including humans and other animal species			1
this is important as disease can be spread by local people , who , earning an average of $ 1 ( £ 0.59 ) a day , delve into the forest for resources such as water and firewood , as well as to hunt bushmeat			0
the region , which is the most densely populated in @entity26 , is also a magnet for thousands of eco-tourists who trek to the habituated gorilla groups , eager to observe the wild apes in their natural habitat			1
the @entity162 , which orchestrates the gorilla tourism program , requires tourists maintain a 23ft ( 7m ) distance from the gorillas			2
however , the gorillas are not aware of the rule and often approach much closer , making disease transmission a primary concern			2
but there is two - way traffic around the national park and some of the mountain gorillas , which can weigh 30st , also wander out of the protected forest and into close proximity to local communities in search of eucalyptus and bamboo shoots			1
the common cold could potentially kill the animals , who share 98.5 per cent of their genes with humans			0
on his back : a carer picks up a mountain gorilla called @entity190 so that she can be accurately weighed at @entity79 , @entity30 important work : doctor @entity64 , dr @entity192 and volunteer vet dr @entity193 treat a mountain gorilla called @entity190 at the @entity79 , @entity30 ( left ) , while a young female gorilla named @entity75 sits next to a carer at an orphanage in the same centre love : another view of gorilla @entity75 with her favourite carer @entity78 at the @entity79 , @entity30 in fact , infectious disease , such as human - born respiratory illness , accounts for 20 per cent of mountain gorilla deaths in @entity26			1
gorilla doctors immediately treat all gorillas exhibiting severe respiratory illness symptoms with medications to help the animal overcome the infection quickly			1
the region the gorilla doctors operate in is also one of the most turbulent in the world and has been marred by genocide and war			0
' we monitor their heath , intervene when a gorilla is sick and rescue orphans when they are confiscated by authorities from poachers or dealers ' dr @entity192 , @entity18 head veterinarian in @entity30 at times , the team has been unable to monitor the gorillas ' health , primarily in the @entity30 , where rebel factions have moved into the gorilla 's habitat			1
most recently , the @entity232 rebel group occupied the @entity233 of @entity234 for 18 months and were finally dispersed by the @entity30 army and @entity237 forces , allowing conservation workers to re-enter the park and check on the gorillas and other wildlife			1
their latest mission , to fly a young @entity244 's gorilla orphan named @entity130 to the @entity245 in north - eastern @entity30 , was made possible by @entity237 forces			1
gorilla doctors has provided critical medical care to over 30 orphan gorillas since the organisation 's inception			1
the @entity251 , located in @entity252 , @entity30 , is home to four mountain gorilla orphans and one suspected @entity244 's gorilla orphan			1
the @entity258 and @entity259 ( @entity257 ) center is home to 14 @entity244 's , or eastern lowland gorilla orphans			0
tongue clip : a close up of gorilla @entity75 being assessed in the quarantine zone at @entity79 , @entity30 oral exam : mountain gorilla @entity266 lies under anaesthetic while @entity269 and @entity270 watch on at @entity79 ( left )			1
@entity266 is also seen ( right ) with dr @entity192 needing treatment : a close up of mountain gorilla @entity272 having her teeth checked at the @entity79 , @entity30 the @entity244 's gorilla is slightly larger and less hariy than the mountain gorilla subspecies			1
dr @entity192 , the @entity18 head veterinarian in @entity30 , has been directly involved in the care of 24 orphans rescued from poachers			1
he said : ‘ my work with the @entity18 consists of saving one gorilla 's life at a time			0
‘ i usually spend about 20 days in the field at a time but this is determined by the gorillas ' health , which can increase the number of days			2
‘ we monitor their heath , intervene when a gorilla is sick and rescue orphans when they are confiscated by authorities from poachers or dealers			0
’ the latest rescued orphan was a female gorilla - later named @entity75 - who was turned over to officials at @entity84 after being caught in a poacher 's snare			0
new arrivals at the @entity305 , such as infant @entity75 , must be placed in quarantine for 30 days , to establish the health status of the animal and prevent transmission of diseases among orphans			0
once @entity75 arrived at the @entity79 , she was immediately placed in the care of experienced caregivers @entity78 and @entity315 , both former @entity234 rangers			0
‘ these two men are very experienced in the care of orphan gorillas ’ said dr @entity64			2
want something to eat ? dr @entity64 offers a banana to a gorilla named @entity130 onboard a @entity237 helicopter from @entity138 , @entity30 medical assistance : @entity75 being assessed in the quarantine zone at the @entity251 ‘ they know how to make gorilla appeasement vocalizations , gently hold the orphan when she is frightened and encourage her to eat - which is not a small task			2
they will remain with @entity333 , even sleeping beside her , to slowly gain her trust			0
’ as infants , it can be difficult to distinguish between the two subspecies of eastern gorilla			0
the gorilla doctors take blood , fur and faeces samples , and ship them to the @entity344 in @entity345 , @entity346 , for dna analysis before they can determine the orphan 's long - term care facility			2
dr @entity64 added : ‘ if we confirm she is a @entity244 's gorilla she will be taken to @entity257 to join the 14 other orphans there			0
‘ if , on the outside chance , she is found to be a mountain gorilla she will stay at @entity79 and join the four mountain gorillas , @entity266 , @entity357 , @entity269 , and @entity270 , who live there			0
‘ either way , she will finally be back with her own kind , living in a forested enclosure and allowed to be a healthy and happy gorilla			0
’ the gorilla doctors were formed in 1986 as the @entity364 , later becoming the ‘ @entity365 ’			0
starting from the first @entity366 , dr @entity367 , the organisation now employs 14 veterinarians and operates in @entity30 , @entity29 and @entity28			1
the gorilla doctors is powered by the non-profit @entity365 and the @entity371 and is directed by dr @entity372 and dr @entity373 .			0
