by @entity0 @entity1 v @entity2 @entity7 was one of @entity9 ’s best friends so it was perhaps not surprising he went to a ‘ weird ’ place last season following the tragic death of one of @entity16 cricket ’s brightest lights			1
@entity9 ’s passing , aged 23 , on a south @entity19 railway line in 2012 shocked the cricketing world and devastated a @entity2 squad that is only now starting to come to terms with his tragic loss			1
@entity7 ’s form deserted him , averaging just eight in the @entity26 while also struggling in shorter formats , but this season he has been transformed and now stands on the brink of an @entity30 place			1
growing up : @entity2 opener @entity31 ( pictured ) believes @entity9 's death affected him tragic : former @entity2 cricketer @entity9 was found dead on a south @entity19 railway track in 2012 strange : @entity7 says 2013 was ' weird ' because the @entity2 squad was deeply affected by @entity9 's death @entity3 former @entity30 all - rounder @entity37 has been named in @entity3 ’s squad for finals day despite spending the last three weeks in a fish and chip van filming a documentary for @entity42 about the nation ’s favourite dish			1
@entity45 and @entity46 are also included in @entity3 ’s squad			2
it is understood @entity37 - who came out of retirement to play two t20 games earlier this season - is unlikely to play , but his inclusion raises the intriguing possibility of him bowling to his 2005 ashes winning team - mate @entity53 if @entity3 and @entity2 reach the final			2
@entity5 @entity5 captain @entity55 is highly regarded by @entity30 ’s hierarchy and the young batsman has a chance to rubber - stamp his inclusion in the @entity61 squad with a strong showing on saturday			1
@entity5 , beaten finalists last year , are playing in their fifth consecutive finals day			1
they take on @entity3 in the second semi-final at 2.30pm			0
@entity67 @entity30 batsman @entity68 has a chance to showcase his t20 credentials as part of the @entity73 squad that face @entity2 in the first semi-final			1
the @entity30 star is under pressure for his one - day international place with uncapped @entity78 breathing down his neck after some fine displays for @entity81			2
a strong showing on saturday could help @entity68 ’s case			2
‘ @entity9 ’s death had a huge effect on myself and all the mates around him and the club and his family , ’ @entity7 said ahead of saturday ’s @entity84			1
‘ it was a hugely tragic situation			0
i think we have moved forward very well this year since then			0
i ’m very impressed with how everyone has come out and done this season			2
‘ last year i was just in a weird place with cricket			0
i did n’t feel like i was getting anywhere with my game			0
i was concentrating on too many exterior factors other than watching the ball			0
‘ i ’m in a much better place this season			2
things outside cricket can affect how you play sometimes and it ’s just about finding a way of eradicating those negative things			0
‘ the last two years i have matured a huge amount			1
obviously a few things i have been through off the field have made that possible			0
’ talented : @entity9 's death affected the @entity2 squad and forced them all to ' mature ' , says @entity7 on the brink : @entity7 's outstanding opening for @entity2 this season has led to calls for him to play for @entity30 saturday ’s appearance at @entity118 against @entity73 in the last four of the @entity119 will provide @entity7 with another opportunity to demonstrate his @entity30 credentials			1
if @entity2 defend their title , they will owe a significant debt to @entity7 after a season that has seen him elevate himself to the brink of international recognition			1
earlier this month he hit five sixes in six balls for @entity130 against @entity131 and he has been instrumental in powering @entity2 into the @entity61 semi-finals with some outstanding hitting at the top of the order			1
it says a lot about how much the @entity139 born star has improved this season that he remains frustrated he was not able to join an elite club of batsmen to have hit six maximums in an over			2
‘ not much has changed technique-wise this season , but mentally i have been a lot more relaxed , taking each game as it comes , ’ the 24 - year - old said			0
‘ if i do well i stay level and if i do badly i try and stay on the same level			0
not having too many ups and downs has been a massive factor			0
praise : @entity7 says that @entity2 's coaching team of @entity154 and @entity155 have been ' good ' for him ‘ last season , being younger and a bit more immature i would get upset and angry			1
i knew in my mind what i wanted to achieve but i was n’t achieving it and that ’s probably the most frustrating thing for anyone			0
so this time around i ’m just staying relaxed			0
’ @entity2 ’s new coaching regime of @entity139 @entity154 and club legend @entity155 - replacing @entity166 - has clearly had a calming effect on a squad of players taken to the brink by their friend ’s premature passing			1
‘ @entity154 has been very good for me , ’ @entity7 said			2
‘ he ’s very basic , which is exactly what i was looking for			0
he ’s basic and to the point and i know as long as i keep my basics right then i ’m strong and in a good place			0
’ unlucky to miss out on a place in @entity30 ’s one - day squad to face @entity180 , @entity7 can expect a call up for the solitary @entity84 international at @entity118 on september 7			1
‘ if i can keep scoring runs i think anything ’s possible to be honest , ’ he said			0
‘ i feel like i can handle myself at all levels so fingers crossed i get the opportunity to do so and score runs			0
’ coaching team : @entity155 ( pictured ) and @entity154 have led @entity2 to a second straight finals day @entity190 man : @entity53 ( left ) could line - up for @entity154 's ( right ) @entity2 at @entity84 finals day			1

@entity194 player @entity9 died on a south @entity19 railway line in 2012
@entity9 's passing had a ' huge effect ' on the @entity2 squad last season
but @entity7 says the squad have ' matured a huge amount ' *due* to the tragedy
@entity7 will hope to demonstrate his @entity30 credentials on saturday
@entity2 face @entity1 on @entity209 finals day
@entity7 has been impressive at top of the order and hopes to defend title
