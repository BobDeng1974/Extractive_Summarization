the search for the missing @entity2 's black box involves a staggering array of sophisticated ships , aircraft and equipment , with eight countries contributing 17 vessels and 19 aircraft – including @entity12 nuclear submarine @entity10			1
and today , it looked like the scale of the operation had paid off , with reports that the flight recorder had been located deep in the @entity18			1
@entity20 radio station @entity19 tweeted the discovery , citing aviation expert @entity22 , who revealed the flight recorder had finally been found more than a month after the @entity24 went missing			1
the black box is likely to be around 15,000 feet down and a staggering array of ships and planes are hunting it @entity31 's prime minister @entity30 , who is in @entity32 , said searchers are ' very confident ' the signals detected were from the black box from @entity36 , which mysteriously vanished as it flew from @entity37 , @entity38 , to @entity39 with 239 people on board on march 8			1
' we have very much narrowed down the search area [ to the southern @entity18 ] ... and we are very confident the signals are from the black box from @entity36 , ' said mr @entity30			1
' we have a series of detections , some lasting for quite a long period of time			0
' we 're now getting to the stage from where the black box is starting to fade			2
we 're hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires			0
' i really do n't want to give any more information than that at this stage ... as a sign of respect to the @entity32 people and their families			0
speaking from @entity60 , @entity32 , mr @entity30 added that today 's discovery was a huge step in solving the mystery - and even claimed that officials believe they can now pinpoint the position of the missing black box flight recorder to ‘ within some kilometres ’			1
' this is probably the most difficult search in human history , ' he said			0
' among tragedy , however , there is hope			0
we are confident we know the position of the black box to the nearest kilometre			1
vigilant : captain flt lt @entity78 of the @entity80 @entity79 flying a p - 3 orion during the @entity36 search hi - tech : crew members of a @entity80 @entity79 @entity81 operate radar and sensor systems during the search @entity32 's @entity87 liaison officer commander @entity88 , transits from the @entity91 class @entity92 ( @entity93 - 171 ) to board the @entity31 @entity87 ship @entity94 as they continue to search in the @entity18 for missing @entity96 flight @entity36 a @entity98 @entity97 conducts a low level fly - by before dropping supplies to @entity31 @entity87 ship @entity101 as they continue to search for @entity36 on friday ' but confidence in the position is not the same as recovering the wreckage from more than 4.5km beneath the sea and finally determining all that happened on that flight			1
' the fact that mr @entity30 has reportedly used the word ' confident ' suggests that searchers are finally convinced that weeks of scouring the @entity18 might now have resulted in the discovery of the missing @entity24			2
the prime minister , who also met with @entity32 president @entity115 in @entity39 today , said he will first need to brief the @entity32 because most of the 239 passengers were from that country			2
relatives have complained in the past of not being kept informed of progress in the search			0
' this will be a very long , slow and painstaking process , ' mr @entity30 told president @entity115 mr @entity30 's announcement came after a fifth ping was detected around 1,500 miles north west of @entity20 , in western @entity31			1
the signal was captured on thursday by a @entity98 @entity128 aircraft , which had been dropping sonar buoys into the water at the time			1
the @entity31 defense vessel @entity132 tows a pinger locator in the first search for the missing flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder the towed pinger locator on the deck of the @entity31 defense vessel @entity132 the search area in the @entity18 , @entity141 of @entity31 , where pinger contacts have been recorded in the search for flight @entity36 the buoys each have a hydrophone listening device that dangles about 300 metres ( 1,000 feet ) below the surface and their data are sent via radio back to a plane , @entity146 commodore @entity145 said			1
however , @entity153 , who is coordinating the search for the plane , later said in a statement that an initial assessment had determined the signal was not related to an aircraft black box			1
even if it is discovered , the plane 's black box , or flight data and cockpit voice recorders , may hold the answers to why the @entity24 lost communications and veered so far off course when it vanished while flying to @entity39			1
search crews are racing against time because the batteries powering the devices ' locator beacons last only about a month - and more than a month has passed since the plane disappeared			2
finding the black boxes after the batteries fail will be extremely difficult because the water in the area is 4,500 meters ( 15,000 feet ) deep			2
the @entity31 ship @entity132 is towing a @entity177 device that detects black box signals , and two sounds it heard last saturday were determined to be consistent with the signals emitted from aircraft flight recorders			1
two more sounds were detected in the same general area on tuesday - just days before the fifth ping was detected yesterday			2
the planned search area in the @entity18 , west of @entity31 , for the wreckage of flight mh370 on friday april 11 friday 's search area in relation to previously searched sectors @entity10 as it pulls out of @entity192 in 2001			1
the @entity12 nuclear submarine is a crucial asset in the search for black box @entity197 , which has joined the search for the black box it 's thought that the black box lies 15,000 feet down in the @entity18 the @entity132 was still towing its pinger locator to try to find additional signals today , and the @entity203 were continuing their hunt , mr @entity153 said			1
the underwater search zone is currently a 1,300 - square - kilometre ( 500 - square - mile ) patch of the ocean floor , about the size of the city of @entity210			1
' it is vital to glean as much information as possible while the batteries on the underwater locator beacons may still be active , ' mr @entity153 said in a statement			0
the searchers are trying to pinpoint the exact location of the source of the signals so they can send down a robotic submersible to look for wreckage			0
mr @entity153 said today that a decision to send the sub could be ' some days away ' the @entity225 submersible takes six times longer to cover the same area as the pinger locator being towed by the @entity132 and would take six weeks to two months to canvass the current underwater search zone			1
complicating matters is the depth of the seabed in the search area			0
the signals are emanating from 4,500 metres ( 15,000 feet ) below the surface , which is the deepest the @entity225 can dive			0
the search coordination center said it was considering options in case a deeper - diving sub is needed			0
meanwhile , the centre said the surface area to be searched for floating debris had been narrowed to 46,713 square kilometres ( 18,036 square miles ) of ocean extending from 2,300 kilometres ( 1,400 miles ) northwest of @entity20			2
investigators believe the plane went down in the southern @entity18 based on a flight path calculated from its contacts with a satellite and analysis of its speed and fuel capacity			2
separately , a @entity38 government official said yesterday that investigators have concluded the pilot spoke the last words to air traffic control , ' good night , @entity38 three - seven - zero , ' and that his voice had no signs of duress			0
a re-examination of the last communication from the cockpit was initiated after authorities last week reversed their initial statement that the co-pilot was speaking different words			0
the senior government official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to speak to the media			0
meanwhile , @entity38 's government has now begun to investigate civil aviation and military authorities to determine why opportunities to identify and track @entity36 were missed in the chaotic hours after it vanished , two officials said			2
the preliminary internal enquiries come as tensions mount between civilian and military authorities over who bears most responsibility for the initial confusion and any mistakes that led to a week - long search in the wrong ocean			2
' what happened at that time is being investigated and i ca n't say any more than that because it involves the military and the government , ' a senior government official told @entity295			0
in an interview with @entity295 last weekend , @entity96 chief executive @entity296 said internal enquiries were under way , although he declined to give details			0
a government spokesman did not respond to @entity295 questions over whether an investigation had been launched			0
the senior government source said it was aimed at getting a detailed picture of the initial response			0
it was unclear which government department was in charge or whether a formal probe had been opened			0
@entity38 's opposition coalition has demanded a parliamentary inquiry into what happened on the ground in those first few hours			0
government officials have said any formal inquiry should not begin until the flight 's black box recorders are found .			1

reports have *emerged* that missing @entity2 's black box has been located deep in the @entity18
@entity31 prime minister @entity30 says he is ' very confident ' signals are from @entity36 , missing since march 8
he even claims that officials believe they can now pinpoint position of box flight recorder to ' nearest kilometre '
announcement came after fifth ping was detected around 1,500 miles north west of @entity20 , in western @entity31
signal captured yesterday by @entity98 @entity128 aircraft , which had been dropping sonar buoys
possible black box signals were heard for several minutes earlier this week by ship in remote area of the ocean
underwater search zone is currently 1,300 - square - kilometre patch of ocean floor , the size of city of @entity210
