for more than a decade , the war between @entity1 and @entity2 has raged - each battling to be crowned the ultimate first - person shooter in the genre			1
both sides had casualties - for every @entity8 there was a @entity10			1
nevertheless , their battle lines were very different			2
while @entity1 focused on the cinematic and dramatic , @entity2 strived for realism and simulation			1
take cover : there 's a clever lean - and - shoot mechanic that you need to master however , @entity19 has decided to buck the latter series ' trend			1
although the 2010 tier 1 outing hinted at a @entity25 blockbuster influence , @entity22 is substantially more garish in its approach			0
from the opening level , where you 're dodging shipping containers falling from the sky to the action - packed car chases and high - quality cut scenes - it 's clear this latest @entity2 puts entertainment before simulation			1
and as a result , the line that once distinguished it from @entity1 is more blurred than ever - a move that may enrage some fans , but will be welcomed by others			1
similar to the aforementioned , the relatively short six - hour campaign whisks you off to a variety of locations - from @entity49 to a monsoon ravaged @entity51			1
the narrative , which largely follows the exploits of an operator called ' preacher ' is well paced , but not particularly coherent			1
although the varied environments are a welcome change to its predominately desert - based predecessor , proceedings can often be uncomfortably interrupted by the npcs who populate them			1
varied : bright one minute , dark the next , @entity64 offers plenty of environments @entity67 is by far one of @entity2 ’s weakest hands , with enemies often taking cover in the open or charging straight into machine gun fire			0
there ’s no sense that you ’re fighting against one coherent force , rather a bunch of individual bots with reckless disregard for their own lives			0
the tier 1 operators , too , are not quite as skilled as expected			0
they 'll throw rogue grenades , shoot at inanimate objects and sometimes just stand idly by while you 're taking fire			0
thankfully , where @entity2 excels is its gameplay			0
shooting is wonderfully responsive , with each weapon providing its own unique feel and result			0
weapon models are all well - detailed and sound authentic , too			1
the breach mechanic is startlingly similar to the @entity1 series , but @entity19 have tried to breathe new life into it			0
before a breach , you are given a choice of how to do it			0
this ranges from throwing in a flash bang grenade , to hammering the door down or shooting the lock			0
although each one is essentially just a pre-set animation , the slow - motion gunplay that follows is infinitely rewarding			1
there are also some strong vehicle sections - which , although so often a weakness in games of this type - work remarkably well			1
a car chase in the early stages is a particular highlight - the handling and clever level design helping to give you the illusion of freedom , even if it 's in fact rather linear			1
work together : in the campaign , you 'll often have @entity67 team - mates working with you graphically the game performs admirably , too , and is backed up with strong audio effects			2
the @entity128 engine has been tweaked since its @entity130 inception , resulting in wonderful lighting and animation			2
texture quality does take a slight hit , as do some character models , but they are acceptable payoffs given the silky - smooth frame - rate			2
multiplayer in @entity64 is superb			0
there ’s the standard deathmatch and other expected modes , but what makes it stand out is @entity143			1
here , you work as pair of @entity146 special forces soldiers			0
@entity149 , there are lots of mechanics in place to ensure working together is tactically sound and entertaining			0
you can share weapons and ammo at any time , see your partner ’s status and position through solid objects , and can spawn on your team - mate if he ’s safe			2
also , if your friend is killed , taking revenge and shooting his slayer will see him instantly respawned			0
@entity2 has always divided opinion , and @entity22 will be no different			0
different focus : the game sacrifices realism and concentrates on action indeed , critics may argue its somewhat shallow nature takes away from what it means to be a @entity173 1 operative			2
but what it lacks in realism , it makes up with its colossal production values and memorable multiplayer - a tried - and - tested recipe for success			1
it 's not the deep , emotional journey many were expecting , but action blockbusters never are			0
follow @entity183 on @entity184 : @ @entity185 and on @entity186 : @entity187 .			2

*frostbite* 2 engine is more refined than ever
@entity143 mode is brilliant
narrative can be hard to follow , and less *emphasis* on realism may annoy some fans
well thought - out vehicle sections and set pieces
