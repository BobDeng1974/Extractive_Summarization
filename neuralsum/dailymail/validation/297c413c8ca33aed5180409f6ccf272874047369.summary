leading author and expert professor @entity1 has developed predictions of what @entity4 cities will look like in the future , and his findings will come as a shock to many			1
it gives an insight into what @entity4 will look like 30 years ' time			0
the cities will be much more like @entity14 and @entity15 in terms of cityscape with increased futuristic architectural design			1
food and shade producing trees will adorn all streets giving a much stronger green canopy less hard surface feel to the cities , while cars will be few in number , small , driverless and lightweight			1
‘ i anticipate the effects of climate change could have a huge impact , ’ professor @entity1 of @entity43 says			0
‘ as key global resources run out , we will have to adapt how we live and our cities will change to reflect that			0
mass migration will also drive big changes as parts of the planet become much less inhabitable			0
' in @entity56 the vision is that it will have a great @entity57 in @entity30 the @entity31 will be white - grey , covered in solar absorbing material and will also have large open scoops over its main arches that collect massive amounts of rainwater			2
there will be greenery on skylines that will have energy efficient vertical gardens , and increased use of ‘ aquaculture ’			2
more ‘ towerscapes ’ will be on the skyline ( @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 )			1
@entity56 is predicted to have a great towerscape / city skyline , with the @entity77 covered for heat protection and water catchment			1
aquaculture and solar arrays will be across @entity82			0
in @entity84 road tunnels will appear to become safe havens through extreme weather conditions – due to global warming , and energy use transport will flock @entity84 ’s river crisscrossed with dozens of foot / cycle bridges			0
@entity84 will see its river crisscrossed with dozens of foot / cycle bridges inner city parks will be transformed for agriculture and water catchment in @entity96 @entity96 will have a new @entity98 climate			2
inner city parks will be transformed for agriculture and water catchment			2
depopulation due to climate change and a collapse in water catchment is predicted in @entity105			1
it ’ll be a poorer , less well maintained city overall			0
‘ @entity4 ’s cities will have grown in size and complexity but the major change will flow from a hotter , wilder climate and great stresses on basic resources , especially water and energy , ' professor @entity1 says			1
depopulation due to climate change and a collapse in water catchment is predicted in @entity105 ‘ on the positive side , great transitions to clean energy will have been made , and all parts of the urban fabric put to work harvesting energy and water			1
the urban tree canopy will have grown to give a much more forested feel to the cities			0
’ the findings have been used in @entity132 ’s @entity131 , which is inspired by the hit 1995 film set in 2043			2
it starts on thursday night .			0

increased futuristic architectural design will *typify* @entity4 cities
cars will be few in number , small , driverless and lightweight
no personal flying cars however , but lots of drone like machines
these *vehicles* will carry a small number of *passengers*
it *'s* predicted @entity30 will have more ‘ towerscapes ’ on its skyline
the @entity77 will be covered for heat protection and water catchment
images are used in @entity162 television *series* set in 2043
