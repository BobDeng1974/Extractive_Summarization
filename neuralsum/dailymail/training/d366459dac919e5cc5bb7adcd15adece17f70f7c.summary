there have been plenty of spectacular catches in @entity4 cricket but @entity6 's effort for @entity7 against @entity8 tops the lot			1
@entity6 was standing on the boundary when @entity8 ' @entity11 mowed @entity12 into the leg - side			2
the ball was going over his head so the @entity7 fielder caught it with one hand ( which was remarkable in itself ) and threw the ball up into the air to avoid carrying it over the boundary for six			1
pouched : @entity6 takes the catch with his right hand as he falls backwards towards the boundary keeping his eye on the ball : after throwing the ball up to avoid taking it over the rope with him , @entity28 turns taking off : as the ball comes back down , @entity6 gets his body and hands into position superman : @entity6 has lift - off as the ball comes down into his hands @entity6 from the blue : the @entity7 seamer takes the stunning catch , diving to his left all in a day 's work : @entity6 looks nonchalant after taking the superb boundary catch the best was yet to come however , as @entity28 sprung back into action , and dived forward and to his left to take the stunning catch			1
they say catches win matches , but this one did n't as @entity7 slumped to 126 all out chasing 165 in the second @entity4 match			2
@entity6 's effort is possibly even better than the catches taken by the @entity58 / @entity57 combination for @entity59 this summer			1
they teamed up to great effect against @entity62 in the @entity64 match , with @entity57 taking the ball on the boundary and throwing it to @entity67 as he headed over the rope			0
and the roles were reversed last week against @entity70 , when it was @entity67 who did the initial work and @entity57 took the catch			0
that one was even better			0
but are either better than @entity6 's stunner ? judge for yourself below			0
video : @entity57 and @entity67 combine against @entity62 video : @entity67 and @entity57 against @entity70			0

@entity6 caught @entity11 off the *bowling* of @entity12
@entity7 fielder took ball in one hand , threw it up then dived and caught it inside the rope
@entity8 beat @entity7 in @entity4 match
@entity6 's effort possibly better than @entity57 / @entity58 combination
