by @entity0 @entity1 has n’t even confirmed that it ’s working on a smartwatch yet , but that has n’t stopped a wave of designers creating concepts of what the so - called @entity7 could look like			0
previous concepts resembled the square and clunky design of @entity12 ’s @entity11 , yet the latest images from @entity15 designer @entity14 imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device			1
@entity14 took inspiration from fitness bands , as well as the look and functionality of @entity1 ’s @entity21 , to create a watch that is ‘ like something @entity1 would actually produce			1
@entity33 websites reported in december 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip - maker @entity35 on a wrist - worn gadget			0
it was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use @entity39 to communicate with other devices , including an @entity41			1
other rumours suggest the @entity7 will feature @entity44 voice controls that let users dictate messages , rather than use the tiny screen			0
the watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video , on the phone or tablet			0
in july last year , reports in the @entity55 said @entity1 was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its @entity7			2
further reports in september claimed @entity1 was struggling to make a number of @entity7 components , meaning the release date would be pushed back			0
the concept watch is shown as a simple band , fitted round the wrist like the @entity65 , with a curved touchscreen			1
the lockscreen is shown as having a basic black and white interface , and according to @entity14 , it would show the time and date , as well as a button to activate @entity1 ’s voice assistant @entity44			1
@entity14 explained that he wanted the concept lock screen to mimic those on the @entity41 and @entity75			1
this means users would swipe up to unlock , swipe down to see notifications and double - tap to open @entity44			0
once unlocked , the watch 's homescreen would have four app icons stacked on top of each other , with a page controller on the right - hand side			0
users would then swipe up or down to move between pages of apps , in a similar way @entity41 users swipe left and right			2
the watch would additionally come with a physical home button , as well as volume controls , and pressing the home button would return users to the lockscreen			1
the new claims about a rounded design contradict previous reports the @entity7 would have a curved screen , as seen in this concept by @entity14 @entity14 ’s watch does n’t just look the part , either			1
he also explained how menus would work : ‘ one of the challenges i ran into was what to do about tabs			0
’ the @entity41 and @entity75 has tabs across the bottom of the screen			1
‘ a normal tab view across the bottom was n’t going to work so i came up with a simple drop down control in the title bar , ’ continued @entity14			2
‘ tapping this would display a popover menu showing the other available pages			0
i also purposely left out several of the controls like @entity121 and @entity122			0
‘ on a device this small i think it makes more sense to manage apps , contacts , and media from a synced @entity41 or @entity128 ’ the lockscreen , pictured left , is shown with a basic black and white interface that would show the time and date , as well as feature a button to activate @entity1 ’s voice assistant @entity44			1
once unlocked , the phone ’s homescreen , pictured right , would have four app icons stacked with a page controller on the right - hand side @entity14 said he ' wanted to retain a slim form factor like the @entity142 and incorporate familiar @entity144 components from @entity21			1
[ the concept ] , pictured , needed to feel natural on the wrist and look like something @entity1 would actually produce ' similar to other smartwatches on the market , including the @entity151 , @entity14 ’s concept would connect to an @entity41 via @entity39			1
describing the design process on his blog , @entity14 said : ‘ a few months ago @entity154 posted an @entity7 mockup that looked like a marriage between a @entity65 and an @entity41			1
‘ it was an impressive concept that got a lot of people excited including myself			2
however , it had a major flaw : the orientation of the interface made it impossible to use			0
‘ i had some free time over the holidays so i decided to take a stab at the problem and create a more user friendly concept			0
‘ i wanted to retain a slim form factor like the @entity142 and incorporate familiar @entity144 components from @entity21			2
it needed to feel natural on the wrist and look like something @entity1 would actually produce			0
’ previous @entity7 concept images , including this one from @entity177 magazine , featured a square screen , and a clunky design , that more closely resembled @entity12 's @entity11 smartwatch @entity12 beat @entity1 to the smartwatch market when it released its @entity182 - powered @entity11 , pictured , in september			2
however , its design , functionality and battery life has been heavily criticised and experts believe @entity1 may have delayed its @entity7 release to learn more about what customers like , and do n't like			0

this latest concept was created by @entity15 designer @entity14
@entity14 took inspiration from fitness bands , as well as the @entity21 design
his concept has a curved touchscreen with a physical home button
swiping actions would mimic those used on the @entity41 and @entity75
