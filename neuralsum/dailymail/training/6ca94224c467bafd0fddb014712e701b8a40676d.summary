' i knew something was wrong when i wet myself , i ’d never experienced incontinence in the past			1

' thankfully it took just six weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before a scan showed my tumour had completely gone			1
' ms @entity2 first blamed her tell - tale signs of cervical cancer - such as irregular periods - on recently having given birth to daughter @entity50 in march 2013			1

' but my labour was different this time and my cervix did n’t dilate properly			1

' in hindsight , she says there were other symptoms , too			0
‘ i was also suffering with lower back ache - which is also a sign of cervical cancer - even before i had @entity50			1
' despite that , i was up to date with all my smear tests and never dreamt this could happen to me			0
' i want to encourage other women to not delay going to the doctors like i did			0
' she said : ' i thought doctors would suggest a hysterectomy which i was happy with			0
i just wanted to live to see my children grow up			0

' my treatment included internal radiotherapy called brachytherapy			2
ms @entity2 will find out next month whether the treatment has been successful and if she has the all - clear			1
she said : the treatment was really tiring and at times , i felt like giving up			0
