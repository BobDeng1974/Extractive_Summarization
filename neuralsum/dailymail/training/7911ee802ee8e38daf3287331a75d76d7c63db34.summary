plastic bags are seen as the scourge of the landscape , threatening the lives of wildlife and marine creatures around the world			1
yet urban bees in @entity8 have found a novel use for the litter			0
research from the @entity12 has revealed some urban bees have resorted to using small pieces of plastic bags and plastic building materials to construct their nests			1
the plastic is used as a substitute for plant resins and researchers claim it highlights the ' bees ' resourcefulness and flexibility in adapting to a human - dominated world			0
' researchers from @entity8 found two species of urban leafcutter bees , pictured , have started using small pieces of plastic as a substitute for plant resins in their nests			1
in both cases , larvae successfully developed and were free from parasites			1
the study claims this means the plastic could be making the nests more secure ‘ plastic waste pervades the global landscape , ’ said lead author @entity39 , a doctoral student at @entity40 and a @entity12 graduate			1
‘ although researchers have shown adverse impacts of the material on species and the ecosystem , few scientists have observed insects adapting to a plastic - rich environment			2
’ the flight of the bumblebee may seem clumsy and slow , but new research claims these humble insects can reach altitudes higher than the peak of @entity58			0
despite their rotund bodies and relatively small wings , researchers from @entity60 found that bees can negotiate air so thin it would kill a human - making them the finest flyers in the insect world			2
in a series of experiments , scientists placed wild bees in a flight chamber and while all managed to fly at heights of 7,500m ( 24,606ft ) , two exceed heights of 9,000m ( 29,528ft )			0
@entity39 , along with professor @entity77 , supervisor of analytical microscopy at @entity79 , made the discovery while examining nest boxes in @entity82			1
they found two solitary bee species using plastic in place of natural nest building materials			2
the first bee , @entity89 , traditionally uses plant resins to build its nests , yet @entity39 found evidence of a grey ‘ goo ’ in the bees ’ boxes , which he initially believed to be chewing gum			1
@entity77 used a scanning electron microscope to take highly detailed pictures of the item , as well as x-ray microanalysis to determine the elements in the sample and infrared microscopy to identify polymers			0
he discovered that the @entity107 campanulae was occasionally replacing plant resins with polyurethane - based exterior building sealant , such as caulking , in its brood cells , created in a nest to rear larva			0
researchers found two solitary bee species using plastic in place of natural nest building materials			1
the first bee , @entity89 , was found using plastic building sealant , while a second , the alfafa leafcutter , pictured , replaced parts of its nest with plastic bags the researchers also discovered another kind of bee , @entity123 , an alfalfa leafcutter , was using pieces of polyethylene - based plastic bags to construct its brood cells.the glossy plastic replaced almost a quarter of the cut leaves normally used to build each cell			1
markings showed that the bees chewed the plastic differently than they did leaves , suggesting that the insects had not collected the plastic by mistake			0
nor were was there a shortage of leaves for the bees in the study			0
‘ the plastic materials had been gathered by the bees , and then worked - chewed up and spat out like gum - to form something new that they could use , ’ @entity77 said			0
in both cases , larvae successfully developed from the plastic - lined nests			1
in fact , the bees emerged parasite - free , suggesting plastic nests may physically impede parasites , according to the study			2
the nests containing plastic were among more than 200 artificial nest boxes monitored by @entity159 as part of a large - scale investigation of the ecology of urban bees and wasps , a project involving numerous citizen scientists			2
‘ the novel use of plastics in the nests of bees could reflect the ecologically adaptive traits necessary for survival in an increasingly human - dominated environment , ’ @entity39 said			0
the research was published recently in the journal @entity176 .			0

researchers from @entity12 studied bee nest boxes in @entity82
they discovered *mysterious* ' goo ' in the nests of two leafcutter species
analysis found this substance was a type of plastic sealant
evidence of small pieces of plastic bags were also found in other nests
in both cases , larvae successfully developed and were free from parasites
study claims the plastic could actually make the nests more secure
