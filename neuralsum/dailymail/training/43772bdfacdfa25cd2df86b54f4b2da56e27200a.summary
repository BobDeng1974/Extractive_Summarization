by @entity0 published : 14:53 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 02:40 est , 19 december 2012 this is the first picture of @entity2 , the new baby daughter of firebrand @entity4 striker @entity3			1
the little girl was born earlier this month to his ex-girlfriend @entity7 , 27 , and arrived three weeks early - she had been due on christmas day			1
@entity2 has yet to see his daughter in the flesh and and is said to have only seen pictures of her via email			1
bambino : @entity16 's ex @entity7 and their daughter @entity17			1
the @entity4 player has yet to meet his child in her first interview since giving birth @entity7 lashed out at the player for failing to act as a proper father			1
in an interview with glossy @entity26 weekly @entity25 , @entity7 posed for several pictures with @entity17 , as well as her mother and brother @entity29 , after securing a five figure deal with the magazine			1
@entity25 is the same publication that printed pictures of a topless duchess of @entity35 in the summer which were taken while she was on holiday in @entity39 with prince @entity40			2
@entity7 stormed : ' @entity3 for me is irresponsible			1
it came to a certain point where he was just not interested in anything , not in me or our daughter			2
' up until certain things happened he was supposed to marry me			0
that was our project , our desire			0
' then all of a sudden everything collapsed and i do n't know why			0
' glossy : the picture appeared in @entity25 , the magazine which featured topless pictures of the @entity58 @entity7 and @entity2 were an item for almost a year but split up in march after she flew to @entity61 to confront him over a series of alleged affairs - the bust up was so furious that police had to be called to his @entity67 home			1
then in june during the @entity69 , @entity7 contacted @entity2 to tell him she was pregnant with their child but initially he refused to accept it was his and demanded a dna test			2
devastated @entity7 then hit back and said she had no fear of taking the test and her family rallied round her as it emerged she had also been contacted and urged to have an abortion - something the deeply religious underwear model ruled out completely			1
two months ago things appeared to be back on track when @entity2 issued a statement saying he was dropping the @entity74 requirement and that he would be ' trying again ' with @entity7 and the two were pictured kissing on the balcony of home in @entity89			2
but despite his promise it quickly became clear he had no intention of doing the honourable thing as @entity7 confirmed that after he left her in @entity89 he failed to contact her in the following weeks			1
@entity7 , who appeared on @entity98 's version of @entity96 , described he moment she went into labour and rushed to the clinic			1
' i sent @entity3 a text message at 3pm when the first contractions started and then again at 6.30pm when i went into the delivery room			0
i sent him another as soon as i came out and @entity17 had been born			1
' but he only bothered to get in touch at half past midnight when my phone rang			0
' i said to him " @entity3 , i 've given birth " and he just said " ah ok , i 'm not bothered " and he then put the phone down			0
i 've not heard from him since			0
' ' @entity3 's not even bothered about seeing his daughter - even if he does n't want me to take a dna test anymore i will do			2
i will make the results public so everyone knows @entity17 is @entity16 's daughter			1
' scuffles : @entity2 has been in a few confrontations with his @entity4 teammates , including @entity121 ( left ) and @entity122 ( right ) when asked if @entity2 had offered financial help @entity7 said : ' i have not had any economic help from mr @entity16			1
' he is worth more than @entity127 's @entity126 but for his own daughter he has n't flashed a penny			2
i have not even had a call asking if i needed anything			0
i do n't need him or his money			0
' however when asked what she would do if @entity2 did get in touch , @entity134 said : ' the door for his daughter is always open			0
the door of my heart is closed forever			2
' i think when he came back to @entity89 a couple of months ago to see me that was just a pr exercise			0
' things then were not going well for him on and off the field			0
' he does n't have any paternal instincts			0
he is not even curious about his own daughter			0
' @entity7 , whose previous boyfriends have included @entity150 , named her daughter after a mystical monk called @entity153 who was famous for having bleeding wounds in his hands and feet exactly where @entity156 had them			1
during the summer she made a pilgrimage to his shrine near @entity161 where she was photographed in prayer in front of his statue with her mother and brother			0
heated : @entity168 of @entity169 and @entity16 have words during the hotly - contested @entity61 derby nine days ago			0

@entity17 was born three weeks early to the *footballer* 's @entity26 ex
@entity7 has *accused* him of being ' irresponsible ' and taking ' no interest ' in his daughter
she added that her heart is now ' closed ' to the @entity4 forward
