by @entity1 reporter published : 01:25 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 10:27 est , 4 november 2012 @entity2 took to the campaign trail with former president @entity4 last night as he appeared to take the lead with early voters in key states just days before the election			1
both former presidents and @entity11 governor @entity10 took tot he stage in the @entity11 clad in matching black jackets in front of 24,000 supporters as @entity17 forecasters give @entity2 early voters ' weight in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
with @entity11 being one of the most closely contested battleground states , the sky was the limit for his supporters and those left to be swayed			2
' he has been traveling all across the country for this campaign			0
he 's been laying out the stakes so well that our team basically calls him the " secretary of explaining stuff , " ' @entity2 said back on the former president			2
' he was a great president ; he has been a great friend , ' he added			0
despite a presumptive advantage in early voters , it is n't as big as the one he had over @entity65 four years ago			2
that swap has given @entity67 challenger @entity42 's campaign hope that the former @entity70 governor can erase the gap when people vote on tuesday			0
more than 27 million people have already voted in 34 states and the @entity75			1
no votes will be counted until @entity17 but several battleground states are releasing the party affiliation of people who have voted early			2
so far , @entity82 voters outnumber republicans in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 - five states that could decide the election , if they voted the same way			1
@entity67 have the edge in @entity87 , which @entity2 won in 2008			0
final push : with just days to go before the election president @entity2 is seen rallying a crowd at a campaign event in @entity93 on saturday fight on : seen also on saturday but in @entity95 , @entity94 fought for his own footing with his campaign estimating themselves being stronger than @entity2 's first opponent of @entity65 in 2008 @entity2 dominated early voting in 2008 , building up such big leads in @entity87 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity23 that he won each state despite losing the @entity17 vote , according to voting data compiled by @entity105			1
' in 2008 , the @entity65 campaign did n't have any mobilization in place to really do early voting , ' said @entity109 , an early voting expert at @entity110 who tallies voting statistics for the @entity112			0
' this time around the @entity42 campaign is not making the same mistake as the @entity65 campaign did			0
' @entity109 said he sees a shift toward @entity67 among early voters , which could make a difference in @entity23 , which @entity2 won by the slimmest of margins in 2008 , only 14,000 votes			1
the @entity67 shift , however , might not be enough to wipe out @entity2 's advantage in @entity21 and @entity22 , which @entity2 won more comfortably in 2008			1
in @entity87 , @entity20 and @entity24 , get ready for a long night of vote counting on tuesday			2
@entity42 's campaign aides say they are doing so much better than @entity65 did four years ago that @entity42 is in great shape to overtake @entity2 in many of the most competitive states			2
' they are underperforming what their 2008 numbers were and we are overperforming where we were in 2008 , ' said @entity133 , @entity42 's political director			0
' we feel very good heading into the tuesday election			0
' forecast : more than 27 million people have already voted in 34 states and the @entity75 , with @entity2 's team claiming to hold the majority of votes in key states @entity2 's campaign counters that @entity42 ca n't win the presidency simply by doing better than @entity65			1
' it 's not about whether or not they 're doing better than @entity65 did , ' said @entity148 , @entity2 's national field director			0
' it 's about whether or not they 're doing better than us			0
' about 35 per cent of voters are expected to cast ballots before tuesday , either by mail or in person			0
voters always can cross party lines when they vote for any office , and there are enough independent voters in many states to swing the election , if enough of them vote the same way			0
still , both campaigns are following the early voting numbers closely , using them to gauge their progress and plan their @entity17 strategies			0
a look at early voting in the tightest states : @entity87 : about 1.6 million people have voted , and @entity67 outnumber @entity82 37 per cent to 35 per cent			1
those numbers are a reversal from four years ago at this time			0
inevitably , @entity2 won the early vote by 9 percentage points in 2008 , giving him a big enough cushion to win the state , despite narrowly losing the @entity17 vote			2
early voting in @entity87 is expected to account for about 80 per cent of all votes cast , giving it more weight than in other states			0
check list : @entity82 voters currently outnumber republicans in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 but different from 2008 's election , are without @entity87 @entity20 : about 3.9 million people have voted , and 43 per cent were @entity82 and 40 per cent were @entity67			1
for years ago at this time , @entity82 early voters had a 9 percentage point lead over @entity67			2
@entity2 won @entity20 's early vote by 10 percentage points in 2008 , getting 400,000 more early votes than @entity65 , enough to offset @entity65 's advantage on @entity17			1
tight race : with a potential close call in ballots , @entity87 , @entity20 and @entity24 can soon get ready for a long night of vote counting on tuesday in @entity20 , @entity67 have historically done better among people who vote by mail , while @entity82 have done better among people who vote early in person			1
for 2012 , @entity20 's @entity67 - led @entity201 reduced the number of in - person early voting days from 14 to eight			2
the @entity2 campaign responded by encouraging more supporters to vote by mail , and @entity82 were able to narrow the gap among mail ballots			2
democrats quickly took the lead among all early voters , once in - person early voting started			1
but the margins are slim			0
the @entity2 campaign acknowledges it must do better among @entity20 's @entity17 voters than @entity2 did on 2008 , when @entity65 won the @entity17 vote by 5 percentage points			1
@entity21 : about 614,000 people have voted , already exceeding @entity21 's total number of early votes in 2008			1
so far this year , 43 per cent of early voters were @entity82 and 32 per cent were @entity67			2
four years ago , @entity2 won the early vote in @entity21 by a whopping 27 percentage points , 63 per cent to 36 per cent			1
@entity65 , meanwhile , won the @entity17 vote by about 1,800 votes - less than a percentage point			0
together , they added up to a 10 - point victory for @entity2			0
@entity42 's campaign argues that @entity82 always do better among early voters in @entity21 while @entity67 do better among @entity17 voters , even when president @entity231 narrowly carried the state in 2004			1
@entity2 's campaign counters that with early voting on the rise , @entity42 will be left with fewer @entity17 voters to make up the difference			1
strategics : both campaigns are following the early voting numbers closely , using them to gauge their progress and plan their @entity17 strategies @entity22 : about 628,000 people have voted , and 44 per cent were @entity82 and 37 per cent were @entity67			1
four years ago , @entity2 won @entity22 's early vote big , 59 per cent to 39 per cent			1
@entity2 also won @entity22 's @entity17 vote on his way to a comfortable 13 - point win over @entity65			1
the @entity42 campaign argues that @entity2 is n't doing nearly as well among early voters in @entity22 as he did in 2008			1
the @entity2 campaign argues that it does n't have to			0
@entity23 : about 2.5 million people have voted , and 48 per cent of them were @entity82 and 32 per cent of them were @entity67			1
four years ago at this time , @entity82 had a slightly larger lead over @entity67 , and @entity2 won the early vote by 11 percentage points			0
@entity2 lost the @entity255 by 17 percentage points in 2008			0
but the early vote was much bigger than the @entity17 vote , resulting in @entity2 's narrow win			0
@entity2 's campaign cites the big lead for democrats among early voters , while @entity42 's campaign argues that even a small shift toward the @entity67 could flip the state to @entity42			1
@entity24 : more than 1.6 million people have voted , and 29 per cent were @entity82 and 23 per cent were @entity67			1
forty - seven per cent were unaffiliated , more than enough voters to swing the state to either candidate			0
@entity24 may once again be pivotal in the race for the presidency			0
unfortunately , @entity24 's early voting data is limited			0
party affiliation in @entity24 is based on the last primary in which a voter participated , so new voters and those who do n't vote in primaries are listed as unaffiliated			0
in 2008 , @entity2 won @entity24 by 5 percentage points .			2

forecast of early voters in key states of @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 show a lean toward president @entity2
more than 27 million people have already voted in 34 states and the @entity75 though how they were voted has only been estimated
