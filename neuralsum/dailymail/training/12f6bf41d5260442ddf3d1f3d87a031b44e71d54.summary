blastoff for the spacecraft which could one day take humans to @entity3 is set for the final countdown as @entity5 revealed the capsule has been completed			1
it will blast the experimental capsule in orbit using a huge @entity10 already waiting on the launchpad - although the rockets are then expected to be replaced by @entity5 's even bigger space launch system			1
the assembled @entity15 crew module , service module , launch abort system and adapter will reside in @entity20 's @entity19 until its scheduled rollout to the launch pad , set for nov. 10			1
it will reside there until nov. 10 , when it will be rolled out to @entity29 at @entity30 ahead of its dec. 4 test flight			1
the three common booster cores are 134 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter			2
each has an rs - 68 engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant producing 656,000 pounds of thrust			1
all totaled , the three @entity10 boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust			1
the second stage of the @entity10 rocket is 45 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter			1
it uses one @entity49 engine , also burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant creating 25,000 pounds of thrust			1
at the launch pad , it will be lifted onto the @entity55 rocket that will carry it into space for its uncrewed flight test			1
' this is just the first of what will be a long line of exploration missions beyond low earth orbit , and in a few years we will be sending our astronauts to destinations humans have never experienced , ' said @entity67 , deputy associate administrator for @entity68 ' it 's thrilling to be a part of the journey now , at the beginning			2
' ' we 've been working toward this launch for months , and we 're in the final stretch , ' said @entity20 director @entity76			0
last month the @entity55 rocket , built by @entity55 , made its move to nearby @entity29 at @entity30			0
the rocket 's three @entity79 were tested , processed and attached to each other to form the first stage that will connect to @entity15 's service module			1
it then was raised wednesday from the horizontal position into its vertical launch configuration			0
' @entity15 is almost complete and the rocket that will send it into space is on the launch pad			1
' we 're 64 days away from taking the next step in deep space exploration			0
' @entity15 was moved sunday out of the @entity93 at @entity5 's @entity20 in @entity25 as its launch abort system was fitted			1
this system is designed to protect astronauts if a problem arises during launch by pulling the spacecraft away from the failing rocket			0
during the december , uncrewed flight , the jettison motor , which separates the launch abort system from the crew module in both normal operations and emergency , will be tested			2
for @entity15 's dry run , the @entity108 - built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast , and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays			1
once the launch abort system is stacked on the completed crew and service modules , and the three systems are tested together , the @entity15 spacecraft will be considered complete			2
it then will wait inside the launch abort system facility until mid-november , when the @entity55 rocket is ready for integration with the spacecraft			0
the @entity55 rocket ( left ) , built by @entity55 , made its move tuesday night , to nearby @entity29 at @entity30			0
the three primary core elements of the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) @entity55 rocket have now been put together , forming the first stage of the launch vehicle that will send @entity15 far from @entity132 to allow @entity5 to evaluate the spacecraft 's performance in space			1
the three @entity136 were attached in @entity55 's @entity137 ( @entity138 ) , at @entity30 in @entity25			0
the @entity138 building is located at @entity29 where the mission will lift off			0
during its dec. 4 test flight , the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space			1
it will then take two big laps around @entity132 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the @entity147 off the @entity149 coast			0
during the two - orbit , four - hour mission , engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety , the launch abort system , the heat shield and the parachute system			0
the data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models			0
the flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later @entity15 flights			1
the capsule will re-enter @entity132 's atmosphere at speeds approaching 20,000 mph , generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees @entity169 , before splashing down in the @entity147			2
the first booster was attached to the center rocket in june with the second one was attached in early august			0
' the day - to - day processing is performed by @entity55 , ' said @entity174 of @entity5 's @entity175 of the @entity176 ( @entity176 )			2
' @entity5 's role is to keep a watchful eye on everything and be there to help if any issues come up			2
' @entity174 explained that during major testing experts from @entity5 's @entity176 monitor the work on consoles in @entity185 at @entity30			2
@entity186 is home to the @entity20 's upgraded @entity188			0
the facility allows engineers to monitor voice , data , telemetry and video systems that support expendable launch vehicle missions			0
the huge @entity55 rocket w earlier this week put together for the first time at @entity30 in @entity25 ahead of a first test flight of the @entity15 capsule in december , a mission known as @entity201 - 1			1
@entity5 's @entity25 spaceport is also where @entity15 was built and is being processed			1
the @entity10 rocket stages were assembled at the @entity55 plant in @entity205 , @entity206 , about 20 miles west of @entity207			2
after completion , the rocket components were shipped down the @entity210 and @entity211 , a canal , to the @entity212			0
from there they traveled to @entity30 , arriving on may 6			0
the elements of the rocket 's first stage were then transported to the @entity138 for preflight processing			0
' after the three core stages went through their initial inspections and processing , the struts were attached , connecting the booster stages with the center core , ' @entity174 said			0
for @entity15 's dry run , the @entity108 - built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast , and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays			1
a @entity10 rocket will do the heavy lifting			2
it will eventually be launced by @entity5 's new @entity237 ' megarocket '			2
for its first flight test , @entity237 will be configured for a 70 - metric - ton ( 77 - ton ) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed @entity15 spacecraft beyond low - earth orbit			1
in its most powerful configuration , @entity237 will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons ( 143 tons ) , which will enable missions even farther into our solar system , including such destinations as an asteroid and @entity3			0
when asked by a reporter , @entity76 said he wishes @entity15 's flight pace was quicker			1
' but it is what it is , ' he said			0
' given the budget that we have , i think we 've got the best program that you could imagine			0
' @entity15 has its roots in the @entity262 shuttle era ; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low @entity132 orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the @entity268 project .			1

three @entity10 boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust
@entity15 capsule will *undergo* first test flight in december
comes as @entity5 *bosses* reveal *private* contracts for shuttle replacement so they can concentrate on the project
