by @entity1 reporter published : 09:47 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 14:33 est , 14 november 2013 @entity2 said wednesday there is absolutely no way they ’ll allow embattled crack smoking mayor @entity6 ’s allies use their famous car logo			1
just a week after finally admitting he smoked crack and one day before announcing he ’s purchased illegal drugs , mayor @entity6 was photographed signing his loyal fans ’ t - shirts emblazoned with the logo			1
while self - described denizens of ‘ @entity15 ’ cling to their support for the mayor , the carmaker made it clear yesterday that they in no way support @entity2			1
and not just because he drives a @entity22 anything for the fans : @entity26 's crack smoking mayor @entity6 was photographed signing shirts brought by his fans to a charity event tuesday that featured the carmaker 's logo in place of his last name ' we view it as an unauthorized use of our trademark ' : on wednesday , @entity2 spokespeople quickly denied any associations with those making the shirts and said they 'd made moves to stop the use of their logo ‘ we view it as an unauthorized use of our trademark and have asked it to be stopped , ’ spokesman for the carmaker , @entity49 , told @entity50			1
the scandal of the crack - smoking mayor broke six months ago , when the @entity55 newspaper and media blog @entity54 said they had been shown a video of the mayor smoking crack , an allegation that @entity2 spent six months denying			2
then , last week , he announced he had in fact smoked the crack during one of his ‘ drunken stupors			0
’ nonetheless , supporters lined up at a @entity68 charity event on tuesday to get the mayor ’s signature on bobble - head dolls of himself that @entity2 had made for the cause			1
and some brought with them the ‘ @entity15 ’ shirts that featured the auto company ’s recognizable logo			1
‘ @entity2 did not grant permission for use of its logo , ’ @entity49 emphasized			2
meanwhile , the mayor does n’t even drive a @entity6 , he drives a @entity22 and that @entity81 even played a part in the mayor ’s long list of scandals after he was snapped reading a document while at the wheel of the @entity81			2
@entity2 tough : despite admissions of drugs use and purchases , video of erratic drunken behavior , and alleged ties to organized crime , @entity2 continues to cling to office and even retains loyal supporters who believe @entity6 has helped them escalading : the mayor does n't own a @entity2 , but this @entity81 which he was photographed driving while distracted by a handful of documents in addition to his admitted crack use and dangerous driving , @entity6 has been accused of having organized crime ties			1
and just days for smoking crack cocaine , he admitted on thursday he was ‘ extremely , extremely inebriated ’ in a short expletive - laden video posted online			0
the news hit as a campaign by some city councilors to ask the @entity110 provincial government to remove @entity2 from office gathered steam			0
@entity26 city council does not have the power to remove @entity2 itself			0
the blurry , 80 - second clip , posted on the @entity55 newspaper 's website and shown on @entity119 television , shows a clearly agitated @entity2 ranting , making threats and pounding his hands together , while at least one other person seems to be goading him on			2
@entity2 's tenacity has not come without criticism , but unlike in the @entity129 , the city council of @entity26 does not have the power to oust him no matter how much they might loathe the mayor 's behavior @entity134 said it had paid for the video , and said the context of the clip was not clear			1
’ he dies or i die , ’ @entity6 says in the clip , which also refers to something happening ‘ in that ring ’			2
he adds : ‘ i need fucking 10 minutes to make sure he 's dead			0
it 'll be over in five minutes			0
’ it is difficult to force a mayor of @entity26 out of office , unless he or she violates election or conflict of interest rules , or goes to prison			0
there are no recall elections of the sort that take place in the @entity129			0
and even if there were , the mayor ’s continued and inexplicable popularity — which by some counts had even risen following his admission of crack use — suggests a vote may not even help the cause of the city council desperate to oust him .			0

the carmaker is n't thrilled with *sharing* their name with the embattled mayor

' we view it as an unauthorized use of our trademark ' : a spokesman for the 110 - year - old company said they *'ve* moved to stop the mayor 's fans from using the logo
