far - right groups in @entity2 could see a resurgence in the wake of the @entity6 terror attacks , campaigners have warned			1
anti-fascists are worried about the rise of potentially dangerous teenage neo-nazis			2
a collapse in support for the @entity12 and @entity13 had been seen as part of a decline in far - right extremism			1
although @entity31 groups have so far failed to capitalise on the emergence of @entity33 , it said , ‘ as we have seen with events in @entity36 in recent days , the situation can change very fast ’			1
it also warned of growing anti-semitism			2
the group , which has monitored the @entity31 for a decade , said it had detected several disturbing signs of revival and warned that the openly racist @entity43 group @entity42 is attracting young recruits			1
the report , by @entity24 chief executive @entity45 and researcher @entity46 , said : ‘ this is probably the most ideological @entity47 group to emerge in @entity2 for decades			1
’ in october @entity48 , a 21 - year - old @entity42 supporter , was jailed for sending anti-semitic tweets to @entity51 mp @entity50			1
extreme : since the demise of the @entity13 , the @entity31 has splintered ‘ this appears to have upped the ante , the attention bringing a new lot of admirers and wannabes from the rest of the @entity31 , ’ the report found			0
it noted that the monitoring group @entity63 reported a record 302 anti-semitic incidents last july during the @entity66 conflict			1
but the most prominent @entity31 groups – the @entity12 and @entity13 – have struggled with internal splits and the rise of @entity71 , the report found			2
the @entity12 , which had 58 councillors and two meps , has suffered since leader @entity74 was ousted and now has only two councillors			0
@entity71 has ‘ steamrollered through their previous heartlands and stolen their voters , ’ the report said			0
it noted that @entity71 is not @entity31 and has a ban on ex @entity12 members , but added : ‘ while @entity71 is not the @entity12 and @entity84 is not @entity74 , it is clear that most former @entity12 voters feel quite at home in the @entity71 stable			0
’ the @entity13 , which organised a series of high - profile protests against ‘ islamisation ’ , has also fragmented since the group ’s charismatic leader @entity92 , known as @entity94 , quit in late 2013 citing his concerns over the ‘ dangers of far - right extremism ’			1
the report suggested he could make a comeback , adding : ‘ he is the one person currently around who could transform the fortunes of @entity2 ’s @entity31 and anti-islam groups			1
‘ we are aware that many people are actively encouraging him to return and we feel there is a real possibility that he will			0
’ angry : @entity110 ( pictured wearing sunglasses ) is concerned about @entity112 and regularly demonstrates opposition : radical islamists often launch counter-protests such as the one pictured above angry : the reasons for joining the @entity31 are complex and cover a huge range of issues fear : many join out of fear of immigration , although @entity123 says each member has their own line in the sand however , it found that none of the groups has been ‘ able to capitalise ’ on issues such as the rise of @entity33 and the @entity133 grooming scandal , with demonstrations still ‘ relatively poorly attended ’			2
mr @entity45 said : ‘ our report reveals that , despite otherwise favourable conditions , far - right hate networks are really struggling at the moment			2
‘ for that we should all be thankful , though of course we must not rest on our laurels			0
’ the report came as a film screened on @entity144 last night documented the rise of some of @entity2 ’s new sinister @entity31 organisations			1
@entity148 , a former @entity13 member and the founder of the @entity20 , told the programme he believes @entity2 is at war			1
‘ i do n’t think moderate @entity154 exist			0
the jihadis are killing in the name of @entity22 , ’ mr @entity148 , who publicly uses the surname @entity19 , told the documentary			0
‘ they ’re not doing it in anyone else ’s name			0
if you are @entity154 , you are part of @entity22			0
they have no reason to be in this country whatsoever			0
’ another far - right supporter told the filmmakers : ‘ this is the grim reality of @entity170 2015			2
a country tearing itself apart			0
‘ i ’d be happy breaking their bones			0
i ’d be happy hurting them			0
’ a white supremacist group , the 18 in the name is derived from @entity177 - a and @entity178 being the first and eighth letters in the alphabet			1
based on the principle of ' leaderless resistance ' , the group has been connected with a series of murders as well as violent demonstrations			2
during the 1980s , @entity187 was linked with the @entity189 movement in @entity190 , while in the rest of the @entity2 , it joined forces with football hooligans			1
today , it still exists on the fringes of the @entity31 , although many in the movement have disavowed it			0
the group also has imitators in the shape of international ultra-nationalist movements , most notably @entity203 's @entity202			2
frightening : many claim the @entity2 is at war , leading to fears of violent attacks on ethnic minorities identity : @entity123 says the @entity31 - and its opposite numbers - is essentially about identity politics			1

campaigners warn far - right groups in @entity2 could see a resurgence
the @entity6 attacks and @entity218 could increase support for the extremist groups
