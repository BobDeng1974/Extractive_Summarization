by @entity0 published : 05:35 est , 4 august 2012 updated : 10:40 est , 4 august 2012 @entity1 , nicknamed ' @entity1 ' , made history this morning by becoming the first double amputee to compete in an @entity4 when he ran in the 400 metre heat			1
@entity1 , a four - time @entity6 champion who runs on carbon - fiber blades , circled the oval in 45.44 seconds - good enough for second place in his heat and a berth in the semifinals sunday night			1
although it was not his personal best , @entity1 who is representing @entity16 he said after the race : ' on the blocks i did n't know whether to cry or be happy			1
from left : @entity27 's @entity26 , @entity16 's @entity1 and @entity29 's @entity28 starting blocks : @entity1 , a four - time @entity6 champion who runs on carbon - fiber blades , circled the oval in 45.44 seconds - good enough for second place in his heat and a berth in the semifinals sunday night the 25 - year - old runner was born without fibulas and his legs were amputated below the knee before he was a year old			1
' i know @entity1 was the protagonist in the race , ' said @entity26 of the @entity27 , who actually won the heat by .4 but went virtually unnoticed			1
' but i love him			0
he 's a good racer			2
' when asked his about his success , he paid tribute to his coach and his team saying : ' it just means my coach has done a great job			0
we have been together for 9 years			0
' i have run so many times n the @entity55 this crowd feels like a second home to me , ' he added			0
the 25 - year - old had looked set to miss out on a place in the individual event after failing to run a second ' a ' qualifying time to gain automatic selection			1
representing @entity16 he said after the race : ' on the blocks i did n't know whether to cry or be happy ' @entity1 wears the @entity65 cost approx £ 1,300 made of carbon fibre , manufactured in @entity67 each blade weighs 512g ( 18.1oz ) the prosthesis ’ ‘ j ’ curve shape resembles the hind quarter of a cheetah , the fastest animal on land he only has one pair — he trains and competes in the same blades — and he ’s been using the current pair since 2003 if they were to break , he ’d be scuppered ... but they wo n’t spikes are taken from an ordinary @entity84 shoe knee sockets are moulded specially around @entity1 ’s joints , with additional soft cushioning he fell agonisingly short at his final attempt in july , but was selected for his country 's 4x400m relay team - in which he won a silver medal at the @entity93 last year - which meant he could be selected for the individual event			1
earlier this week @entity1 delivered a staunch defence of his participation at the @entity4 , hitting back at critics who think his prosthetic legs give him a racing advantage			1
some critics , including four - time @entity4 champion and @entity103 pundit @entity102 , have said he should not be racing			1
@entity1 calmly put the record straight			2
‘ i know @entity102 quite well and he and i have chatted many , many times , ’ said the 25 - year - old , who is expected to reach the semi-finals of the event			1
‘ i have a lot of respect for him			0
he is concerned about the development of prosthetic legs			2
but the ones i have are the same ones athletes have been using since 1996			0
i ’ve had the same ones since i started running in 2004			0
setting the record straight : earlier this week @entity1 delivered a staunch defence of his participation at the @entity4 , hitting back at critics who think his prosthetic legs give him a racing advantage strong words : some critics , including four - time @entity4 champion and @entity103 pundit @entity102 , have said @entity1 should not be racing ‘ and if the blades give so much of an advantage then why are n’t other athletes who have them running as fast as me ? ' people say i must have an advantage because my legs are lighter			1
but i ’ve got less blood running through them and do n’t have the tendons in my ankles			0
people do n’t talk about that			0
‘ i ’m sure they could make a prosthetic leg that would give people an advantage but i believe in fairness and i ’m happy using the ones i have			2
and they make sure of that because i ca n’t change it anyway because of the @entity146 ruling			0
’ @entity1 is aiming to break the 45 - second barrier in @entity148 , something which has eluded him so far — his best is 45.07sec — and the @entity16 should excel in the relay too having won silver at last year ’s @entity93			1
@entity1 will be allowed to run any leg of the relay , a change from @entity155 where it was considered his blades might injure race rivals			2
‘ any improvements since i ’ve started have not been from any aid or any changes made			0
they ’ve been through hard training and a lot of sacrifice , ’ @entity1 added			2
‘ what i believe in is the fairness of sport			0
it is n’t an advantage			2
in my heart , i know what ’s right and i would n’t be running if i had any doubt			0

the four - time @entity6 champion circled the oval in 45.44 seconds - good enough for second place in his heat and a berth in the semifinals
did not beat his personal best of 45.07
@entity1 : ' on the blocks i did n't know whether to cry or be happy '
the 25 - year - old runner was born without fibulas and his legs were amputated below the knee before he was a year old
has been criticised for having an ' *unfair* advantage '
