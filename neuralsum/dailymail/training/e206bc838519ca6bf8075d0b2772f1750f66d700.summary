by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter published : 07:01 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 19:03 est , 16 december 2013 home secretary @entity4 said tougher penalties of up to life imprisonment for human traffickers would lead to more prosecutions trafficking gang victims who are caught working in a cannabis farm or forced to run a brothel will escape prosecution			1
home secretary @entity4 announced a blitz on the ‘ scarcely believable ’ modern slave trade yesterday amid claims there are up to 10,000 @entity18 victims			1
a @entity20 bill will introduce a maximum sentence of life in prison for human traffickers , and new guidelines will be issued which state victims should not face prosecution			1
a review by @entity29 mp @entity28 says those who commit crimes after being trafficked usually do so ‘ at the behest of their controllers ’			1
it adds : ‘ this may be children and young persons compelled into forced labour in cannabis farms and factories ; those who are forced to run a brothel as part of their enslavement ; or those in possession of false immigration documents			0
’ mrs may warned last month of slaves working in nail bars			2
she said slavery is ‘ all around us , hidden in plain sight ’			0
home secretary @entity4 said that it was impossible to know exactly how many people are being held in conditions of servitude in @entity18 , but referrals to official agencies suggest that the numbers are growing			1
the draft @entity61 , published today , sets out the government 's plans to tackle the problem of people being trafficked into the @entity18 to work in conditions of slavery			1
thousands of slaves are thought to work in building sites and farms as well as brothels , shops and in domestic servitude			2
the bill pulls together into a single act the offences used to prosecute slave - drivers and increases the punishments courts can hand down			0
crime hotspot : earlier this month police raided brothels , sex shops and lap dancing clubs in @entity84 in a crackdown on drugs and people trafficking the government has been under pressure to act because fewer than 10 prosecutions are secured each year , despite there being thousands of victims			2
@entity29 mp @entity28 , who has produced a report into slavery for the @entity20 , estimates that there are 10,000 victims of slavery in the @entity18			1
but mrs may said : ‘ the honest position is that we do n’t know if that ’s the right figure or whether there are fewer or indeed more victims in the @entity18			1
‘ what we do know if that we have seen more referrals to what is called the @entity107 where people are able to refer people who they think have been trafficked , ’ she told @entity103			0
‘ i mean we have seen more cases being identified in the @entity18 through action by the likes of the @entity113 and the @entity114 and one of the purposes of bringing the bill forward is to ensure we can enhance our ability to deal with the slavedrivers and therefore reduce the prospect of people being victims in the future			1
’ mrs may said one of the obstacles to successful prosecution was the reluctance of victims to come forward because of fears that they might themselves face prosecution or be sent back to their home countries			1
new guidance is being drawn up by the @entity132 to protect victims of slavery from being prosecuted for crimes which they have been forced to commit because of their illegal servitude , she revealed			2
however it is thought that because the victims of trafficking and slavery are often also prosuected - such as the case unsuccessfully brought against a group of @entity145 children forced to work in a cannabis factory – it might deter victims from taking the stand against their exploiters			2
mrs may added : ‘ we do need victims to be willing to come forward and give evidence in these cases			2
‘ that issue of whether or not a victim is going to be treated as a criminal themselves is consistently raised			0
i have talked to both the former and the current @entity132 about the treatment of victims and about why it is that we are not seeking more prosecutions for trafficking and slavery cases			0
@entity29 's @entity164 called for more protection for child victims of trafficking ‘ the dpp and the @entity168 are issuing more guidance to make clear the circumstances around this question of where a victim has been forced into criminality because of their servitude , because of what the slave - driver has done			1
’ the @entity61 contains provisions to give automatic life sentences to offenders who already have convictions for very serious sexual or violent offences			0
it introduces @entity185 to restrict the activity and movement of convicted traffickers and stop them from committing further offences			0
and a new anti-slavery commissioner will be appointed to hold law enforcement and other organisations to account			0
shadow home secretary @entity164 said the legislation should do more to provide protection for child victims of trafficking			1
she said : ‘ there is cross-party consensus that we need new action to tackle modern - day slavery			0
and we welcome the limited moves in this @entity61			0
‘ but we would like to see the @entity61 go further - particularly to provide stronger legal protection for child victims			0
it is right to increase sentencing for traffickers and to make it easier to prosecute these heinous crimes and prevent repeat offending			0

new laws mean human traffickers will face up to life in prison
victims sent to work in illegal *environments* will not face prosecution
report by @entity29 mp @entity28 estimates there are 10,000 slaves in @entity18
home secretary @entity4 says it is *difficult* to know if it is even *higher*
