five @entity2 schools declared failing by inspectors in the wake of the alleged ' @entity6 ' takeover plot by hardline @entity7 have still not improved , @entity0 has warned			1
in the first update following inspections earlier this year , the watchdog 's chief sir @entity8 said that ' too much poor practice remained unchallenged during the summer term '			1
@entity0 also found it has taken too much time to appoint new governors and senior leaders at these schools , meaning that ' very little action ' has been taken to address the serious concerns raised			1
at another school , @entity39 , teenagers studying for a gcse in re ' have to teach themselves for options other than @entity42 ' , @entity0 said , leaving students at a ' significant disadvantage '			1
and at another school , @entity46 in @entity47 , trustees were kept in the dark about a controversial trip to @entity51 involving pupils			1
@entity0 said : ' worryingly , trustees were not aware that a visit to @entity51 had taken place this year for pupils and staff , despite a similar trip last year receiving criticism from inspectors at the previous inspection due to failures in safeguarding			1
' indeed , they had been told by senior leaders that the visit had been cancelled			0
' @entity46 came under fire in june after banning ' un-islamic ' tombolas and raffles at a fete and has now seen parents withdrawing their children from acts of collective worship , the new report found			2
responding to the latest report , shadow education secretary @entity73 said : ' it is utterly incomprehensible that , six months after these serious concerns became public , @entity77 has still not taken action , putting children at risk from radical , hardline agendas and damaging school standards			1
' it is gross negligence from the prime minister and his @entity87 - led government and they must urgently explain their inaction			0
' @entity91 students at @entity39 school have to teach themselves about religions other than @entity42 pupils at @entity46 have been taken on another trip to @entity51 this year , despite criticism for a similar move in the past in june , @entity0 issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of @entity2 's schools and declared five failing , placing them into special measures			1
these schools were @entity39 , @entity105 and @entity28 - all run by the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) , as well as @entity46 and @entity108			2
four separate probes were conducted into the allegations in @entity2 , which were originally sparked by the ' @entity6 ' letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - that referred to an alleged plot by hardline @entity7 to seize control of a number of school governing boards in the city			2
following the publication of the investigations into the @entity6 scandal , ministers announced that in future , all schools will be required to ' actively promote ' @entity125 values such as democracy , tolerance , mutual respect , the rule of law and individual liberty			1
while plans have been drawn up to revamp the curriculum at each of the five schools inspected , these often lack the detail needed to ensure that action will be taken to actively promote these values and tolerance of different faiths , @entity0 said			1
inspectors conducted unannounced follow - up visits to the five schools , four of which are academies and the fifth run by the local council , during a week last month			2
the findings also showed that staff at the schools had ' some optimism ' that there would be changes , but they also raised concerns about equality and fairness			2
@entity155 school was among five schools put into special measures by inspectors following the claims some staff said some people at their school hold jobs that they do not have the experience or qualifications for , the advice note said			1
it also criticised @entity168 for failing to show @entity0 the plan it has drawn up in response to the findings of the investigations into the alleged @entity6 plot			1
sir @entity8 called on the @entity175 ( @entity175 ) to look at how it can take more rapid action to change the trustees and governors of an academy school when there are serious concerns about how it is being run			0
in a statement issued to pupils ' parents , the trustees and executive principal of the @entity107 said it had already addressed many of the issues raised by @entity0			2
' in the period of a month since the monitoring visits , the @entity107 's new transition plan has led to significant progress and this was highlighted by the @entity175 during their recent visits to our academies at the beginning of october , ' the statement said			0
' we remain realistic about the challenges ahead but are focused and determined to maintain rapid and sustained progress ahead of the next monitoring visits , which will provide a more authentic insight into the new leadership and governance arrangements			0
' students at our academies no longer face segregation in classes and several new opportunities are being welcomed			2
' the @entity6 plot first came to light earlier this year , when a letter emerged outlining an alleged a plot by @entity42 hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools			1
the letter prompted @entity175 inspectors to go into @entity220 in @entity2 along with its sister schools , @entity39 and @entity222			0
sir @entity8 said the plot was ' planned and orchestrated ' attempt to control school boards whistleblowers at @entity220 claimed the school was in the hands of a group of extremists who had infiltrated its governing body			0
it is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and @entity238 pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school			1
the letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the @entity175 ( @entity175 ) and @entity0 in to the school and several others in the area			1
following inspections , sir @entity8 told @entity247 in july that there had been a ' planned and orchestrated ' plot to radicalise pupils in schools in the city			2
he told the @entity253 said : ' i spoke to eight or nine head teachers			0
they believed it was planned and orchestrated			0
' they believed people got together and decided which schools to target			0
they believed there was a strategy to infiltrate governing bodies			0
' they believed governing boards could n't take place in the normal way			0
they believed all that was planned and orchestrated			0
this was all in @entity2			0
' when asked by mps if pupils had been radicalised in the schools , sir @entity8 replied : ' we did n't see that			0
the issue of extremism was outside of our remit			0
' the @entity0 chief inspector told @entity247 : ' what we did see was the promotion of a culture , which if that promotion had continued would have exposed these children to extremism			1
