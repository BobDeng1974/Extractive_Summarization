history will show @entity1 to be a certain starter for any all - time @entity3 anyone cares to draw up			1
and whether people like it or not , he will edge sir @entity6 out of an all - time @entity7 to start up front alongside @entity9 in our traditional 4 - 4 - 2			1
@entity1 currently sits third in @entity12 ’s all - time goalscorer list , behind @entity13 who played less games , and record holder sir @entity16 , who played far more games			1
the @entity18 is well on course to become the no 1			0
it should happen in the next couple of years , if @entity1 ’s return in recent seasons is anything to go by			2
@entity1 ’s goals have been scored in an era of unprecedented success for @entity12			1
up until recently @entity12 dominated domestically and with three @entity49 finals in four years were second only on the continent to @entity51 , arguably the best team @entity46 club football has ever seen			2
@entity1 ’s goals were crucial , and helped @entity12 achieve trophies and glory			1
leading the way : only sir @entity16 and @entity13 are ahead of @entity1 in @entity12 's scorers list the rooney - sceptics will point to the transfer requests , but that stuff does n’t affect legend status			1
the great @entity60 once wanted a move to @entity62 , but that does n’t stop him being a @entity64 legend , does it ? @entity1 is on course to have more goals and more medals at club level than @entity16 , @entity13 and @entity69			1
only an unwillingness to face facts could lead anyone to suggest when he finally breaks the record at @entity74 , @entity1 will be a @entity12 legend , and arguably their greatest player of all time			1
for his country @entity1 ’s story is different			0
he has n’t scored a hat - trick in a @entity83 final like sir @entity6 – in fact he has n’t ever scored a hat - trick for @entity7			2
@entity1 has n’t won a @entity86 like @entity9			0
opening up : @entity1 scored a hat - trick on his @entity12 debut against @entity90 but @entity1 is on course to be @entity7 ’s all time record goalscorer , and i loved to hear him talk at the weekend about his desire to be the no 1 for @entity7			1
that ’s passion for your country ! it would be a huge achievement and if it happens , will make him an @entity7 great			2
@entity9 and @entity104 are the top two , and they scored their goals for @entity7 during periods of great success			1
@entity104 won the @entity83 on home soil , @entity9 played in a @entity83 semi-final as well as a quarter - final			0
leading the way : @entity1 has been named @entity7 captain and could break all records third on the list , and the only other player above @entity1 , is @entity118			1
he was in the 1966 squad of course , but his record at @entity122 is n’t good at all			0
just 1 goal in 7 appearances in the finals , no goals in the ‘ 66 tournament , and not considered vital enough to the team for him to return for the final against @entity131 when fully fit			0
in 1962 in @entity133 his main contribution was to pick up a pitch - invading dog during @entity7 ’s defeat to @entity136			0
the animal then urinated all over @entity138 ’ @entity7 shirt			0
you can add your own punchline			0
hat - trick hero : @entity9 is ahead of @entity1 in the @entity7 goalscoring lists good record : @entity118 has a good goalscoring record for @entity7 - but not at @entity122 @entity118 did score six hat - tricks for @entity7 , but as will as sitting only third in the list , that lack of impact at @entity122 – at a time when @entity7 lifted that trophy – holds @entity118 back from being a true international great , although at club level his statistics are incredible			1
@entity1 ’s lack of goals has been part of @entity7 ’s problem at @entity122 of course , but he has been our main striker during a period of relative failure , which makes the number of goals he has chalked up for his country all the more remarkable			2
for some players to achieve greatness on the international scene they have to do it at a @entity83			0
that ’s the real test			0
but it ’s not the only way to become a great for your country			0
sitting on top of the all - time record goalscorers list will make @entity1 an @entity7 great			1
he ’s already scored more goals in competitive games than any other @entity7 player in history			0
only injury will stop @entity1 from breaking the record and achieving greatness			2
@entity186 @entity7 players stepped up - @entity187			0

@entity1 is behind sir @entity16 and @entity13 in @entity12 's all time scorers list
@entity1 is also near the top of the @entity7 goal scoring list
only injury can *prevent* @entity1 being considered a great of the game
