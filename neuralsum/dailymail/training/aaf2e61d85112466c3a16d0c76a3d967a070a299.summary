parents should cut back on the amount of sugar their children consume by giving them yoghurt instead of ice cream , according to a new @entity7 campaign			1
@entity8 , launched today by @entity9 , is promoting ' sugar swap ' tips as part of a push to cut back on the amount of sugar being consumed by young @entity16 on a daily basis			1
it comes as a survey found that two - thirds of parents are worried about the amount of sugar in their children ’s diets , while nearly half believe that their family consumes too much sugar			1
parents should cut back on the amount of sugar their children consume by giving them yoghurt instead of ice cream , according to a new government campaign ( posed by model ) according to @entity35 guidelines , added sugars should make up just one tenth of a person 's calorie intake			1
but statistics show that younger children , particularly those aged between four and 10 , are consuming up to 50 per cent more than this			1
the @entity8 campaign will offer parents a ' sugar challenge ' , suggesting food which can be substituted for sugary products			1
examples include giving a child water or milk instead of soft drinks , or a wholewheat biscuit cereal rather than a sugary cereal at breakfast			1
professor @entity56 , national director of health and well - being at @entity9 said the impact on our health of eating too much sugar is evident			2
he said : ' reducing sugar intake is important for the health of our children both now and in the future			2
' we are all eating too much sugar and the impact this has on our health is evident			0
this campaign is about taking small steps to address this			0
17 per cent from soft drinks 17 per cent from biscuits , buns , cakes , pastries and fruit pies 14 per cent from confectionery 13 per cent from fruit juice 8 per cent from breakfast cereal ' we know from past campaigns that making simple swaps works and makes a real difference			1
' research from the @entity86 found that the average sugar intake of 50 families went down by 40 per cent when they followed the @entity8 advice			1
in one month , the average dropped from 483g to 287g - the equivalent of 49 sugar cubes per day			2
dr @entity93 , @entity94 at the @entity86 and @entity96 data collection coordinator , comments : ' it is fantastic to see that the sugar swaps resulted in a reduction in sugar intake for these families			0
' the @entity86 is delighted to support preventative health campaigns such as this which can help make a real difference to the health of the nation			0
' earlier this year , the government 's own scientific advisers called for the target for added sugar to be reduced by half to 5 per cent of a person 's daily intake			2
excess sugar intake has become a key focus for health researchers and campaigners after it emerged that it causes at least as much damage as vices such as salt			0
two - thirds of parents are worried about the amount of sugar in their children ’s diets , while nearly half believe that their family consume too much sugar a study last month claimed that sugar is likely to be a more significant factor in pushing up blood pressure than salt			1
but the findings were challenged by other experts who said a direct link between sugar and hypertension had not yet been proven			0
@entity141 has nonetheless been identified as a key cause of obesity and associated diseases later in life such as heart problems , cancer and type two diabetes			0
it is also impacting dental health			0
eating and drinking too much sugar means extra calories , which causes fat to build up inside the body			0
this can lead to heart disease , some cancers or type 2 diabetes later in life			0
four sugar swaps recommended by @entity8 : the breakfast swap : swap sugary cereal for plain cereal , such as a wholewheat biscuit cereal the drink swap : swap from sugary drinks to sugar - free or no - added - sugar drinks the after school swap : swap , for example , a muffin to a fruited teacake the pudding swap : swap , for example , from ice cream to low - fat lower - sugar yoghurt children who are overweight or obese when they are young are far more likely to become overweight or obese adults			1
recently published data highlights that approximately 1 in 5 children aged 4 to 5 years old and 1 in 3 children aged 10 to 11 years old is overweight or obese			0
@entity182 , founder of @entity183 said : ' we know that mums want to provide a healthy diet for their children but balancing a number of competing priorities , including healthy eating , can be tricky			0
' this research with @entity183 showed that sugar consumption is a worry for parents but taking steps to reduce sugar can be really difficult			2
' we hope that these simple sugar swaps from @entity8 will make it easier for parents to reduce their family 's sugar intake			2
the @entity8 campaign will feature media advertising as well as a national roadshow and the delivery of sugar swap packs to parents			1
meanwhile , almost two - thirds of people do not know how many calories the average person needs to maintain a healthy weight , according to separate research commissioned by @entity214 , the @entity215 and @entity216			1
a @entity218 survey of 2,025 people , commissioned to mark the launch of a new partnership between the three organisations that aims to improve the health of the nation , found that just 35 % of respondents knew the average man needs to consume 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight			0
only slightly more , 37 % , could pinpoint 2,000 calories as the equivalent for women .			0
