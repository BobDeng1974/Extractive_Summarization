published : 18:08 est , 27 january 2013 updated : 07:08 est , 28 january 2013 slipping through his grasp : was the feather to blame for @entity4 's defeat to @entity5 in today 's final of the @entity7 ? down it came like a voodoo omen , floating from the skies like malevolent thistledown , the tiny white feather that actually did bring the thistle down			1
when @entity4 stopped playing to move a feather that drifted onto court , millions of fans back at home shuddered in horror			1
@entity20 tennis commentator @entity19 thought it was a good omen – he 's obviously never seen @entity22			2
however , seasoned andy - watchers all knew what that ominous bit of feather dusting meant and it was n't that @entity28 was about to get pecked to death by crows			1
it meant that @entity4 's concentration had cracked open , like a fault - line coursing through a granite dam			1
it meant that once more , the end was nigh for the pride of @entity38 as the runner - up spot beckoned			0
for when things start going badly for @entity4 , there is something in the psychological disposition of the world 's number three tennis player that makes him blame something else , rather than his own performance			1
it is a coping strategy , sometimes a desperate one			0
hecklers , sore feet , bad line calls , the man in the @entity54 crowd with the wobble board ( i 'm not joking ) singing @entity58 songs or an innocent feather ? feather ! that 'll do it ! @entity4 picked up the offending fluff with a housekeeper 's zeal and it turned out to be his moment of doom			1
even watching on television thousands of miles away , we could feel the momentum shift as the power inexorably moved across court from @entity4 to iron - man @entity5			1
@entity4 misses first serve , picks up feather , carries on to serve his third double - fault of the match and everything goes downhill from then on			2
flapping somewhere out there on the @entity54 winds , a slightly balding pigeon has a lot to answer for			0
bad sign : commentator @entity19 thought it was a good omen - he 's obviously never seen the birds pain barrier : @entity88 tennis star @entity4 was hindered by severe blisters , which needed treatment yet to be honest , after four hours of intense tennis in the @entity7 final , @entity4 's unravelling was kind of a relief			1
@entity19 kept going on ( and on ) about how he is convinced that @entity4 really should be world number one , but i 'm not sure that we @entity38 could cope with that ; we are pre-programmed to cheer on the national underdog			1
it is what we do best			0
we can deal perfectly with sporting defeats			2
we 've had decades of practice at that game			0
it is the hope , the terrible hope of victory , which is so crushing			2
and this is only the first of the grand slams in what is meant to be @entity4 's year – how on earth will we survive ? after some big wins last year , @entity4 has been playing and behaving more like a champion ; managing to deal with the pressure and expectations of others in a graceful way			1
real nail - bitter : today 's final in @entity54 did not make for easy viewing for @entity4 's girlfriend @entity120 despair : the look on miss @entity124 ' face said it all as her boyfriend fell at the final hurdle earlier in @entity129 he 's even shaved off that dreadful gingery furze on his face , so it 's a love - all from me			1
yet he still has his moments and watching him play can be a sweet kind of torture , especially when his confident , early promise gives way to a gradual erosion of temper and he starts getting a bit , well …			1
under the power of the flying , silver - shoed @entity145 with the bear hair , our @entity4 got his disgruntled grunt on – and promptly lost			2
when things start going badly , he does his tell - tale snarly face , lowers his head like a wounded stag , starts limping about as though someone had put tin - tacks in his trainers			0
one minute he is spinning glorious aces over the net and looking untouchable , the next he is his own bad ass ; doing the fist pump , turning the air blue , doing that snuggle - toothed grimace that suggests there should be a claymore in his hand , not a tennis racquet			0
blistering pace : the hard fought encounter with @entity5 took its tool on @entity4 's body best foot forward : the foot injury hampered the young scot throughout the intense four hour final blame game : he blamed his hamstrings , he blamed the feather , he blamed hecklers , he blamed his blisters painful viewing : watching @entity4 play @entity182 tennis can be be a sweet kind of torture after the match he blamed his hamstrings , he blamed the feather , he blamed hecklers , he blamed his blisters			1
however , in the latter instance , we certainly shared his pain			0
earlier in the match , television viewers were rewarded with a horrendous close - up of the naked @entity4 foot when a physio applied some court - side first - aid			2
we saw @entity4 's battered chipolata toes encased in their individual pods of bandage , all bound up like a ballerina 's			1
his livid skin looked pink and flayed as yellow iodine was painted onto his raw and weeping blisters			0
if that did n't put you off your sunday morning bacon and eggs , nothing could			0
struggling : @entity4 repeatedly showed signs that he was uncomfortable during the men 's singles final full stretch : @entity4 reaches for a return following a powerful shot from his @entity145 opponent what a racket : @entity5 shows great technique as he makes a forehand return in front of millions of viewers loyal support : fans of the @entity225 attempted to lift his spirits from the sidelines inside the arena the torture just kept on coming			1
the terrible squeak - squeak - squeaking of the players ' trainers as they played on the blue @entity233 surface			0
the oofy grunts when they hit a big shot			0
@entity19 saying ' unbelievable ' every five seconds			0
in the end , the @entity20 's main man concluded : ' @entity5 would literally walk through a brick wall to win this title			0
' for her part , presenter @entity241 thought that @entity4 's ' spirit had been broken '			1
more like his blisters , darling			0
there is always the next tournament			0
come back and be unbelievable , @entity4			2
that 's all we ask			0
adversaries : @entity5 proudly holds the @entity252 alongside runner - up @entity4 victorious : @entity5 can not hide his emotion as he wins his third successive @entity7 crown @entity257 , set and match : @entity4 congratulates @entity5 on his famous victory over the net champion : the @entity145 has once again proved his quality by seeing off his rivals to lift the coveted trophy			2

@entity4 's concentration is cracked by an ominous bit of feather
the world number three blames everything but his own performance
watching the @entity88 tennis star play can be a sweet kind of torture
we can deal with defeats but it is hope of victory which is so crushing
