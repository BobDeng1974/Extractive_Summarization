@entity1 said she wants to shed the image that @entity16 is for people of a certain class , and is working hard to show young people ‘ what it is really like ’			1
but at the same time she promised not to ‘ throw the baby out with the bath water ’ and to keep the organisation ’s traditional activities , from making chocolate to building a campfire			1
miss @entity1 said ‘ i would have probably had the perception that @entity16 was for middle - class girls when i was growing up , seeing as i am very working class and i was never a @entity31 or a guide			1
‘ however , the units do reﬂect the places they are in - in terms of social class , diversity and ethnicity			2
’ the head of girl guiding @entity2 added the organisation has an image problem that she was intent on improving			0

i ’ve just shown everyone how cool it is ’ , she told the @entity42			0

‘ i am working hard to shine a light on girl guiding @entity2 so people can see what it ’s really like — and that it is for everyone			0
’ @entity16 is working with charities and youth workers to engage more girls in deprived communities and establish units in places where they have never previously existed			1
she added : ' the number of new girls joining @entity16 has been growing over the last eight years			1
' however , we already have waiting lists of girls in many areas and if we are to serve more young women , we need more volunteers , from a variety of backgrounds to lead a programme in their local community			2
' miss @entity1 one described @entity89 as the ' ultimate feminist organisation ' as it teaches girls confidence and valuable life skills			0
