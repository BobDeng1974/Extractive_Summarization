by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 02:41 est , 13 june 2013 @entity2 leader @entity1 admitted his party had failed women for 20 years a humiliated @entity1 last night admitted he failed to respond vigorously enough to a series of sexual harassment complaints about his party ’s former chief executive			1
the deputy prime minister ‘ made mistakes ’ over the allegations against @entity12 , according to a highly critical report into attitudes to women among senior @entity2			1
mr @entity1 conceded that ‘ women had been let down ’ after the independent report said he should have ‘ asked more questions ’ when the claims – which @entity12 denies – arose five years ago			1
there were several missed chances to hold an investigation , the report added.the inquiry into the wider culture of the @entity2 spanning two decades was launched after the @entity12 claims surfaced earlier this year			1
aside from the complaints by four women against the peer , witnesses reported 32 other sexual harassment and discrimination incidents – including one where a male parliamentarian had made inappropiate advances to a very young male worker			2
city fund manager @entity35 – who wrote the report – yesterday admitted she was ‘ shocked ’ at the party ’s failure to live up to its ideals of equality and liberty , adding : ‘ you have got to practise what you preach ’			2
mrs @entity35 , who found evidence of ‘ low level sexism ’ , said : ‘ mistakes were definitely made			2
they were made by @entity1 , @entity48 and @entity49			2
' you can make a mistake and learn from them , it ’s different from setting out to mislead or to do something wrong			0
’ but she added : ‘ i am not exonerating @entity1			0
’ a formal inquiry should have immediately been launched by mr @entity1 into the allegations of improper conduct involving @entity12 when they were raised by women in 2008 , she said			1
mr @entity1 said the report made ‘ sobering reading ’ and said there was ‘ no excuse ’ for what had happened over 20 years in the party ’s corridors of power			1
@entity12 has strenuously denied acting inappropriately towards women during his time as @entity2 chief executive a formal inquiry was triggered by the allegations surrounding @entity12 , pictured ( left ) after a meeting in @entity73 in 2010 and ( right ) at this year ’s parliamentary pancake race he added that it illustrated that ‘ stretching over a 20 - year period a series of mistakes were made which left a number of women feeling seriously let down and for that there is absolutely no excuse whatsoever ’			1
mrs @entity35 also singled out @entity2 ministers @entity49 and @entity48 for adopting an ‘ informal ’ approach to the complaints which was ‘ ultimately not sufficient ’			0
the inquiry was triggered by the allegations surrounding @entity12 but it was widened to include how the party dealt with other complaints of sexism and harassment			1
it spanned complaints from up to 20 years ago			0
mrs @entity35 said it would not be fair however to hold the party to the same standards for events of decades ago that are expected today			2
her report said former leader @entity101 ’s ‘ relatively relaxed management style ’ , compared to his predecessor @entity102 ’s , ‘ contributed to @entity12 ’s power base ’			1
businesswoman @entity35 said mr @entity1 should have ordered a formal inquiry into allegations of sexual harassment against @entity12 @entity106 , the party ’s chief whip at the time , was also told of the claims about @entity12 in 2008			1
but the allegations did not surface publicly until this year , when @entity110 interviewed two alleged victims			0
at the time , the party denied that mr @entity1 had any knowledge of specific allegations about @entity12			1
he was also quick to criticise the ‘ self appointed detectives ’ of the media as newspapers also investigated the potential scandal			0
mrs @entity35 said there had been ‘ no malicious attempt ’ to cover up the claims but that the way they dealt with them had been ‘ haphazard ’			0
the deputy prime minister had not launched a formal inquiry because he believed the alleged victims had not requested one and wanted to keep their anonymity , she said			0
mr @entity1 told the inquiry : ‘ the natural course of action had been to challenge @entity12 [ @entity12 ] in respect of the allegations and this was duly done			1
he then denied any wrongdoing and the affair was dropped since none of the complainants wished to … substantiate their allegation			0
’ mrs @entity35 admitted she was ‘ shocked ’ by some of the complaints , such as one @entity2 councillor aggressively cornering a female staff member			0
mrs @entity35 criticised the ‘ tendency for the party to try to “ handle ” complaints rather than to fully and properly investigate them in a timely , professional manner			0
’ @entity150 is investigating allegations against the peer – who has denied any wrongdoing			2
mr @entity1 said he would implement all the recommendations made in miss @entity35 ’s report ‘ without delay ’ and had asked her to check on progress in 12 months			2
he admitted the party had to do more , adding : ‘ we must be a party where even a hint of sexism is taken seriously ; where every allegation of harassment is dealt with properly ; and where there can be no fear that power or position can be abused			0
’ @entity171 , the party president , said the ‘ warts and all ’ report made ‘ uncomfortable reading ’			1
mr @entity171 last night told @entity176 that he did not think any of the ministers involved should resign over their failures as the party now had a ‘ gold standard ’ for how to handle future complaints			0
mrs @entity35 , chief executive of @entity181 and a mother of nine , said she nearly ‘ threw in the towel ’ on the inquiry when she took one look at the @entity2 ’ labyrinthine structure			1
her report called for a stronger anti-bullying strategy and a dedicated office to deal with complaints			0
activists should also be made to take diversity courses to make them aware of any prejudices , she added			0
several @entity2 activists told @entity176 in february that @entity12 had made unwanted advances – claims that he denied			2
although the alleged incidents happened years ago , the complainants came forward after becoming concerned that he was involved in a candidate training event this year			0
mrs @entity35 ’s report did not detail the specific allegations about @entity12 because they are being investigated by police .			1

dozens of witnesses tell independent inquiry of *chaotic* way party was run
report was ordered after allegations were made against @entity12
the former chief executive denies any wrongdoing
