boxing champion @entity0 tried to fend off two police patrolmen who stopped his new car by exclaiming : ' i 'm a superstar - i 'm going to report you for jealousy			1
' the 26 - year - old heavyweight who was with his three children in a green @entity9 was so annoyed by traffic on the @entity11 that he decided to shoot along the hard shoulder			1
traffic officers driving in a @entity14 noticed the sportsman sneaking along the emergency - only lane and pulled him over			2
officers informed @entity0 , who is named after the former heavyweight champion ' @entity35 ' @entity34 , that he was going to be booked for the offence , he replied : ' good ... i 'm going to report you to the the police for jealousy			1
' however , officers then discovered that the £ 40,000 vehicle was uninsured and ordered @entity0 to hand over the keys			1

the incident occurred on 18 april 2014 after @entity0 was spotted at around 1:30pm on the hard shoulder of the @entity61 near @entity62 where there had been a build up of traffic on the northbound carriageway			1
he took a slip road before entering the @entity68 towards @entity69 where again used the hard shoulder to pass slow moving traffic			1
eventually the boxer is pulled over by the @entity72 who ask him why he 's using the hard shoulder the @entity23 staff warned @entity0 about driving on the hard shoulder , but he continued to use the emergency lane and was eventually stopped by police who had been alerted miss @entity81 prosecuting said : ' quite simply mr @entity0 is seen to be travelling along the hard shoulder of the motorway			1
he is initially stopped by the @entity23 they stopped him , spoke with him and allowed him on his way			0
instead of proceeding onto the motorway he continues his travels on the hard shoulder			1
the traffic was extremely heavy			0
i 'm going to suggest there is only one reason - to bypass all the traffic			0
it falls below the standard of driving			0
' @entity97 @entity96 who was travelling with a colleague on mobile duty in a @entity101 car told the court they had received information from the regional control centre about @entity0 's car			1
he said : ' we were informed by the motorway control room , they were watching the vehicle on @entity25 travelling along the hard shoulder of the @entity61 in what they believed to be an attempt to bypass standard traffic on what was a busy afternoon			1
we were given the registration number			0
' he added that they located @entity0 and were also given a second account as @entity0 again took onto the hard shoulder to bypass traffic			1
he told the court that they waited for @entity0 at @entity125 of the @entity11 as @entity0 continued his journey north and passed under them			1
the officers stopped @entity0 near @entity129			2
@entity130 added : ' he told us his name was @entity0			2
he gave us an ' 88 date of birth and address in @entity136			0
there was no insurance held for the vehicle he was driving			2
when asked about this he told us his vehicle had just been bought from @entity142 and believed he was driving as a named driver on a traders policy			2
' the boxer , pictured , was fined £ 1,000 and handed eight points on his driving licences after he was convicted of careless driving and driving without insurance at @entity150 but @entity130 said that despite producing a policy there was a discrepancy and that he was not in fact a named driver on that vehicle			1
' when i told him he was been reported he replied with ' good '			0
he also said ' i 'm a boxer , i 'm a superstar , i 'm a celebrity '			2
' he asked for mine and my colleague 's numbers and said he was going to report us to the police for jealousy			2
' he added that there were no other adults in the car but that there had been @entity0 's three children who he believe were eight , nine and 10			1
@entity130 added : ' the vehicle was seized and mr @entity0 was obstructive			2
initially he refused to hand over the keys and said he would organise his own recovery			0
' the court was played moving footage from the @entity174 for the @entity175 which is operated manually			0
@entity0 denied wrongdoing and tried to get the trial delayed due to his illness			2
his lawyer @entity179 told the hearing : ' he is bedridden , a manager or agent of mr @entity182 ( contacted ) saying that his client is effectively bedridden , suffering with diarrhoea and vomiting			1
a medical note dated yesterday says he is not fit for work and he must stay away from work until 48 hours after the last loose motions			1
' but the request was refused after it emerged the boxer made another attempt to get the case adjourned earlier in the week - claiming he was in training for next fight			0
district judge @entity196 said : ' there 's a difference between being unfit for work and being unfit for court			0
i do n't feel the symptoms would have prevented him from being fit for court			0
the court would have been quite accommodating , any difficulties part way through the court could break halfway through for him to use the facilities			0
' he added : ' footage shows the vehicle being driven along the hard shoulder of the motorway			1
clearly it is only for emergencies - it seems pretty obvious he is doing so to avoid slowing , standing traffic			0
there is no evidence he is driving in an emergency situation			0
' there are no other adults in the car just the defendant and three children			0
i 'm satisfied he is driving			0
i find the offence proved			0
' @entity130 examined the documents , they did n't appear to cover mr @entity0			2
in the absence of any evidence provided , i find that the allegation against the defendant is proved			0
' @entity0 is currently preparing to defend his @entity234 at the @entity235 on february 28 , and is set to fight for the @entity236 on april 4 .			0
