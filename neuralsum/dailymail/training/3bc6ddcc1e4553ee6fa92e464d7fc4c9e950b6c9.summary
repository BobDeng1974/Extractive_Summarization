security : extra police had to be called in to deal with today 's protest near @entity21 , @entity22 protest : one demonstrator makes a heart symbol in front of police forces			1

the gene that produces the chemical , was taken from a peppermint plant and inserted into the wheat crops			2
a message on take the @entity49 ’s website said : ‘ this open air trial poses a real , serious and imminent contamination threat to the local environment and the @entity103 wheat industry			1
’ however , professor @entity104 of @entity42 insisted that the chance of any cross-pollination was minuscule			0
‘ we have no idea who is advising them scientifically because it is absolutely incorrect , ’ he said			0
the organisation ’s @entity16 wheat , which was planted last month , has been developed with genes from the mint plant			0
professor @entity104 explained : ‘ the wheat produces a volatile chemical which the aphids do n’t like and it makes them go elsewhere			0
‘ the purpose of it is to see if we can come up with a strategy that would avoid the use of pesticides in wheat crops , as they kill other creatures like bumblebees			2
