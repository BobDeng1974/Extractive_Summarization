by @entity1 reporter published : 13:27 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 06:13 est , 8 july 2013 passengers who were aboard the doomed @entity3 have described the terrifying moment they realized the plane was too low as it prepared to land in @entity6 on saturday			1
one passenger , @entity7 , recalled how seconds before landing he looked out from his window and could see the water of the @entity10 about 10 feet below			1
' i do n't see any runway , i just see water , ' @entity7 told @entity14 of his panic			1
' i realized the [ pilot ] was a bit too low , too fast , and somehow he was not going to hit the runway on time			2
' the plane smashed into the runway , severing its tail , exploding into a fireball and skidding to a halt at @entity25 around 11.40am @entity26 on saturday			1
horror : passenger @entity27 said he noticed the plane was flying very low over the water before the crash crash site : the wreckage of @entity33 at the @entity25 on saturday @entity34 had the same realization , posting online after the crash : ' looking through window , it looked on level of the ( sea ) wall along the runway			1
' @entity43 was also on board the flight with her eight - year - old son who realised something was not right as they came in to land			2
she said : ' my son told me " the plane will fall down , it 's too close to the sea "			1
' i told him " no , baby , it 's ok , we 'll be fine			2
" and then the plane just fell down			1
' @entity7 said the plane hit the runway before it launched into the air , before landing again ' pretty hard '			1
after the crash , he recalled hearing screams and saw his fellow passengers suffering from broken bones , cuts , burns and bruises , while the man in the seat next to him took a blow to the head			1
' it was surreal , ' said @entity7 , who was taken to hospital with minor injuries			2
' a lot of people screaming and not really believing what was happening to them			1
i was nâ€™t believing it either			0
' he stood up and opened the door and saw that parts of one of the wings was gone , but he was just thankful to be on the ground			0
the scene was chaotic but passengers worked together to get out			1
horror : a series of images show the plane just moments after it crash landed , killing two schoolgirls passengers slid down inflatable emergency chutes as smoke billowed from the wreckage			1
in the first comments by a crew member , cabin manager @entity100 said that when the captain ordered an evacuation , she knew what she had to do			0
' at that point , my head became clear , ' she said on sunday night at a @entity6 news conference			0
' i was only thinking about rescuing the next passenger			0
' @entity100 said she was calm despite the flames			0
' i did n't have a moment to feel that this fire was going to hurt me , ' she said			0
when a teenage boy was afraid to jumping onto the inflatable slide , @entity100 said that a flight attendant carried him on her back and they slid down together			0
survivor @entity43 has described the moment she realised @entity120 was coming in too low over @entity10 ' the kid said he was scared			0
my colleague carried him on her back and jumped			0
i was inside the plane			1
( my colleague ) was crying as parents tearfully hugged their kid after evacuating safely , ' @entity100 said			0
she also said passengers were calm during the evacuation			1
near the rear of the aircraft in seat @entity131 , @entity128 said she thought the landing gear had failed when she felt the tail slam against the ground			1
she , too , was with her young son , four			0
' i had no time to be scared , ' she said			0
@entity128 picked up her child , who had hit the seat in front of him and broke his left leg			0
unhurt , she could see a hole that ripped open at the back of the jumbo jet where the bathroom had been and carried her son to safety			0
' it left a hole very close to my seat , ' she said			0
' enough for two persons to get out '			0
sitting near @entity128 was 39 - year - old @entity152 , who was traveling with his wife and teenage son			0
he was shocked by the violent shaking of the crash , then the realization that the back of the plane had ripped off			1
he stood up and could see the tail , but the kitchen was missing with nothing but a hole , he said			0
' i can see through the hole to see the runway and the ground , ' he said			0
' so we just grabbed our bags and rushed out from the tail , from the hole			0
' medics found the bodies of two @entity173 schoolgirls on the runway			1
the airline identified the girls as students @entity177 and @entity179 , both 16 , who were on a class trip			0
miraculously , 305 other passenger on the plane survived the crash , with 123 walking away completely physically unscathed			1
destruction : miraculously , more than 300 passengers aboard the plane survived the horrific crash ' we 're lucky there has n't been a greater loss of life , ' @entity6 fire chief @entity188 said			1
witnesses who saw the plane crash said the plane did not look as though it was on the correct path			1
' the plane started coming in at an odd angle , there was a huge bang and you could see the cloud of huge black smoke , ' @entity197 said			1
' it did n't manage to straighten out before hitting the runway , ' @entity205 , who was in a nearby hotel , added to @entity209			0
' so the tail of the plane hit the runway , and it cartwheeled and spun and the tail broke off ... i mean we were sure that we had just seen a lot of people die			1
' it looked like the plane had completely broken apart			2
there were flames and smoke just billowing			0
' while it appears that the plane could have landed too early and clipped the sea wall dividing the airport from the bay , officials have not released an immediate indication of the cause of the accident			2
@entity234 investigators arrived at the airport around midnight on saturday to begin the inquiry			2
probe : @entity237 of the @entity234 looks over the flight data recorder retrieved from the wreckage			0
an investigation into the cause is now underway apology : @entity244 president @entity243 said he does not believe there was an engine defect black boxes from the aircraft , which record critical data of the flight , have been recovered from the wreckage and will help investigators understand what brought the craft crashing down			1
while authorities have said very little about the investigation at this early stage , clues have emerged in witness accounts of the planes approach and video of the wreckage , leading one aviation expert to say the aircraft may have approached the runway too low			2
@entity264 , a former military pilot and accident investigator who teaches aviation safety at the @entity267 , said it appeared that something on the plane in its low approach may have caught the runway lip - the seawall at the foot of the runway			2
investigators are also looking into what role the shutdown of a key navigational aid may have played in the crash			2
the glide slope - a ground - based aid that helps pilots stay on course while landing - had been shut down by the airport since june			2
@entity244 said it did not appear that the crash had been caused by mechanical failure although it declined to blame either the pilot or an error by the control tower			1
see below for @entity27 's account of the crash			2

passengers describe seeing water just 10 feet below plane before landing
