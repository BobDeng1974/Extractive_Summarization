by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:44 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 11:56 est , 19 march 2013 @entity3 mp @entity2 questioned why ' parasitical ' journalists are allowed to report from @entity5 @entity3 mp @entity2 today launched an extraordinary attack on the media , demanding to know why the ‘ @entity8 ’ are allowed into @entity5			1
the remarks came as @entity10 grilled media campaigners hacked off , including @entity12 who warned that if newspapers refuse to sign up to a new regulator @entity5 should intervene			1
the @entity15 committee was taking evidence after the three main political parties reached a deal on a @entity19 to create a powerful new watchdog to regulate the @entity21			1
mr @entity2 , a member of the committee , voiced concerns ‘ parasitical elements of press ’			1
he said : ' what concerns me is the parasitical elements within the press who abuse their position in here ( @entity5 ) in terms of hiding behind their pen and calling people names , ’ he said in comments apparently aimed at some parliamentary sketch writers			1
‘ that 's the so - called brave people			1
i do n't understand why they are allowed to come into this place and behave in the way that they do			0
’ he also accused reporters of ‘ hiding behind their pens ’			1
it raises the extraordinary prospect of journalists being banned from reporting from within @entity5 , which has been allowed since 1771			2
instead of attacking the @entity21 , mr @entity2 was supposed to be holding to account hacked off , the campaign group which has pushed for tougher regulation of the @entity21			1
@entity50 mp @entity49 said it was ‘ laughable ’ for @entity52 to pose as champions of a free press			1
mr @entity49 , one of 14 conservative mps who rebelled last night over a @entity15 amendment enabling the courts to impose exemplary damages on newspapers which do not sign up to the new regulator , said : ‘ you are not here to represent a free press			1
‘ you 're here to represent people who on the one hand court publicity for all it 's worth if there 's a financial return for them but do n't like the negative publicity that sometimes goes with it			1
‘ you 're here representing the @entity76 of the world			2
you are not here representing the free press of the world			2
’ former formula 1 boss @entity12 told @entity10 claimed the new press regulator plan was a ' win - win ' for the industry @entity2 , @entity3 mp for @entity85 is a former shipyard worker who also worked as a newspaper printer for the @entity87 before getting into politics through the traditional trade union route with the @entity90			1
he came under fire during the expenses scandal when it was revealed he used his allowances to reclaim the cost of a 42 - inch plasma tv , leather bed and hundreds of pounds worth of furniture			0
the @entity99 revealed that in 2005/06 financial year , he used his second homes allowance to pay a £ 991.95 bill for a memory foam mattress and ' ivory leather bed '			0
a further £ 500 spent on furniture and household accessories that year was also claimed on his expenses			0
between january and april 2006 , he reclaimed £ 699 for a three - seater sofa , £ 829 for a two - seater sofa bed , £ 219 for a coffee table and £ 199 for a lamp table			0
asked about his expense claims , he said his constituency was too far from @entity113 to commute			0
he lives in @entity114 , @entity115 with his wife @entity116			0
they have a son and daughter			0
but his comments were rejected by prof @entity121 from @entity122 off who accused some newspapers of trying to distort the @entity126 recommendations in an attempt to undermine them			2
he said : ‘ i think that a great deal of the response to this debate - the whole @entity126 inquiry - has been hysterical and some of it has involved an abuse of the power of the press			2
‘ the distortion in the reporting of the @entity126 inquiry as it progressed was pretty shocking			0
the distortion in the reporting of the report when it appeared was extraordinary			0
’ former @entity143 boss mr @entity12 claimed the new system would ‘ change the climate completely , and actually in the interests of the press ’			0
he added : ‘ because when they finally make their minds up , which i ’m sure they will , that ’s its more economical to be part of the regulator , they will save vast amounts in legal costs themselves			2
‘ it seems to me win - win			0
they ’ve got themselves into a frame of mind where anything remotely legal is somehow a threat to their freedom , which is simply not the case			0
’ he warned that if the industry does not sign up to the scheme , @entity5 should intervene			2
@entity170 , a leading member of the group , said the newspapers had had the chance to make their case to the @entity126 inquiry and should now accept its findings			2
giving evidence to the @entity177 , hacked off director @entity121 accused some newspapers of an ‘ abuse ’ of their power in an attempt to protect their own position			1
last night some of the biggest national newspaper publishers warned there were a number of ‘ deeply contentious issues ’ surrounding plans agreed by the three main political parties for a new regulator established by royal charter			1
however mr @entity193 , who was one of four hacked off representatives present at the late night talks where the deal was hammered out , said newspapers were not entitled to a fresh chance to influence ministers			1
the prime minister , pictured leaving @entity201 ahead of his statement , hailed the deal which would secure upfront apologies and million - pound fines recommendation : @entity126 called for a new press regulator underpinned by statute he said : ‘ we do n't think they are entitled to lobby			1
‘ there was a public inquiry where they were represented by a total of eight or 10 different qcs who argued their case , they have brought their evidence , the judge considered it , the judge came to his conclusion			0
‘ we think that the press should n't have a second bite of the cherry trying to lobby ministers again with arguments that failed in front of the public inquiry			0
we continue to think that those recommendations ought to be implemented			0

@entity2 accused journalists of ' hiding behind their pens '
