@entity0 has been announced as the new co-producer for the latest @entity3 installment disgraced @entity4 boss @entity0 is returning to the @entity6 studio just three days after it was announced she was leaving			1
the executive , whose controversial emails were leaked during the hacking scandal , was revealed as co-producer for the latest installment of the company ’s multi-billion pound @entity3 franchise			1
the deal , which named mrs @entity0 as part of the new @entity3 project came on monday , just three days after it was said she was leaving her post as the co-chairman of @entity20 in may			1
she oversaw the franchise for 13 years at @entity4 and saw it take more than £ 2.6billion for the studio worldwide			0
part of her deal leaving @entity4 will see the company fund a production company she is to set up for four years			0
on top of @entity3 , she is also reported to be under consideration for the re-make of @entity31			2
in one of the offensive email exchanges that emerged , mrs @entity0 made racist jokes about the @entity37 president , suggesting that he would like films about slavery or that centred on black characters			2
‘ should i ask him if he liked @entity43 ? , ’ she wrote			0
in some of the leaked messages mrs @entity0 insulted some of the @entity6 studio ’s most bankable stars			1
in one discussion , she told a producer who complained about @entity50 that the @entity52 star is ‘ actually despicable ’			0
the hack attack was linked to @entity72 , and is thought to have been an attempt to force @entity4 to scrap @entity74 , a comedy about the assassination of the country ’s leader , @entity76			0
@entity78 , the producer who has made over $ 11billion in box office sales , released a statement to say he was working with mrs @entity0			2
' i am thrilled to team with my friends at @entity20 along with @entity0 to produce the next @entity3 movie , ' he said			1
' @entity0 has been deeply involved in the realization on film of one of the world 's most beloved characters			1
' @entity90 's involvement will hopefully deliver the creative continuity and authenticity that fans demand from the @entity94 ( @entity94 )			0
i am equally excited for the opportunity to have @entity3 appear in the @entity94 , something which both we at @entity90 , and fans alike , have been looking forward to for years			2
' dumped : @entity98 will not be coming back as @entity3 in the new reboot , due out in 2017 ancient : at 34 , @entity98 will be considered too old to play the teenage @entity3 ... if indeed the next @entity3 is @entity3 hot property : @entity3 is arguably @entity90 's most recognizable superhero , but has n't been doing that well at the box office under @entity4 but the statement did not say if @entity98 would be coming back , almost certainly certainly throwing him in the scrap pile along with @entity105			1
@entity90 's cinema situation is famously a messy one - although the comic house was bought outright by @entity112 for $ 4billion in 2009 , many of the film rights to its most famous characters had already been sold to rival studios - such as @entity114 and the x-men to @entity116 , and @entity3 to @entity4 - for far more meager amounts before comic book films were the box office gold they are today			1
but @entity4 has been failing to take advantage of owning arguably @entity90 most famous son , @entity3 , as box office performances have been steadily faltering			2
the most recent film starring @entity98 was murdered at the box office by @entity90 's @entity125 , despite featuring a far less - known line - up of comic book characters			0
@entity128 : @entity98 joins @entity105 on the list of former @entity130 , only managing to make two films compared to @entity105 's three the new @entity3 will make his first appearance in may next year in the eagerly anticipated crossover @entity133 , which see 's him take the side of @entity135 against @entity136 in a war over whether superheros should have to register their powers with the government			1
then on july 28 , 2017 the new spider - man will get his own rebooted film franchise - and speculation is rife over who will done the iconic costume : @entity98 will be 34 and considered way too old to play the teenage @entity3 ... if indeed it will be @entity3			0
many fans are calling for the next @entity3 to be black teenager @entity149 , who succeeds @entity3 in the comics			0
@entity151 was among the first to propose a list of viable replacements , including @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , and @entity157			0
new boys : among @entity3 's new replacements touted online are @entity161 star @entity154 ; @entity162 's @entity155 ; @entity163 ; and @entity164 actor @entity157 @entity149 better ? : fans have been pushing for the reboot to do away with @entity3 's well - known origin story , and instead introduce black teen @entity149 as the man behind the mask			1
