@entity0 found himself in the familiar position of defending his captain on saturday with @entity3 badly needing runs and wins in the last two tests of the series to stop the mood for change in @entity11 cricket claiming him as its next victim			1
@entity15 ’s failure to win the first test and @entity3 ’s failure in both innings leaves the captain in the spotlight			1
yet @entity0 , under pressure himself after the sacking of @entity24 as managing director , remains steadfast in his backing for @entity3 and is adamant he will turn things round in @entity28 , starting on tuesday , and in @entity29			1
@entity0 has been forced to defend his captain with @entity3 badly needing runs and wins @entity15 ’s failure to win the first test and @entity3 ’s failure in both innings leaves the captain in the spotlight ‘ i ’ve known lots of people in sport and , in terms of character , @entity3 is one of the strongest , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ even though he did n’t get a score here you could see he ’s found some form , with the way he ’s hitting the ball and moving			0
‘ it was frustrating , but he ’s a very good player and it ’s almost been forgotten how strongly he finished the @entity47 summer against @entity48			0
’ perhaps a bigger concern for @entity15 will be the form of @entity51 , who looked both frenetic and unconvincing on his return to the side 18 months after leaving the @entity55 tour			2
‘ @entity51 has earned the right to get a go , ’ said @entity0 when explaining why he was preferred to @entity56			0
‘ he went back to @entity59 , scored runs and then captained and played well on the @entity62 tour of @entity63			0
@entity3 stands alongside @entity64 at the end of match ceremonies during day five of the 1st test match ‘ we can see he ’s really hungry to do well again and is playing well but he ’s been done by the swinging ball			1
‘ it was his first test for a long time and that was always going to be tough but this is a player who has played some brilliant innings for @entity15 and he ’s got a good chance now to show that he ’s still got that ability			1
’ @entity78 will join the side in @entity28 and is expected to play in the second test , especially as @entity81 damaged his shoulder diving to attempt to take a catch here on friday			2
@entity3 , @entity85 and @entity86 show their frustration as a chance is missed and game heads to a draw @entity15 have also decided to keep @entity92 with them at least for the next week even though @entity93 wanted him to return to them			1
four of the six @entity93 players in this @entity15 squad missed out on selection for the first test while the county champions have been further weakened by an injury to @entity101			2
‘ we ’ve a 17 - man squad now which is a bit top heavy but we do n’t know yet where @entity105 is at , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ at the end of the next test we will see where we are and if it feels relevant to let someone move on we will do that			0
@entity111 edges past @entity3 at first slip off the bowling of @entity114 ‘ i have sympathy with @entity93 but i know @entity92 is desperate to stay here and work on his game			0
he has worked really hard to get into this environment and he ’s learning a lot and working very hard to get a go in this series			0
’ the pressure was increased on @entity0 , @entity3 and @entity15 by new @entity125 chairman @entity124 ’ description of @entity126 as ‘ mediocre ’ before this series and his promise of an inquiry if they are not defeated			1
however , the coach insisted : ‘ we have only one focus and that is to win this series			0
we ’ve drawn the first test after dominating so now it is a two - match series and we have to ignore everything on the outside			0

@entity0 has come to the defence of @entity15 captain @entity3
*batsman* @entity3 is in *danger* of becoming @entity11 cricket **'s** next victim
@entity15 **'s** failure to win the first test has left the spotlight on @entity3
under - fire @entity0 is adamant he will turn things round in @entity28
