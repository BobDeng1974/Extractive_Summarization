@entity0 have fallen off their perch			1
and they ’re dropping like a stone towards mediocrity			2
that is the undeniable fact that has been hammered home relentlessly during the past six months			2
whether we are talking about the events of wednesday night at @entity9 or before the startled eyes of the faithful at @entity12 , the evidence is there for all to see			1
ca n't stop the slump : @entity15 can not believe it as he watches @entity0 lose at @entity9 down and almost out : @entity17 lies on the floor during a defeat which sees @entity0 's @entity21 campaign hanging by a thread disbelief : @entity23 cries out in vain during another shambolic @entity0 display abject : the frustration shows on the @entity0 players ' faces on taking the restart after conceding to @entity9 coming to get you : @entity32 are looking to take @entity0 's place in the top four now is it time for @entity0 to sack @entity15 ? out of the title race , out of the @entity37 , out of the @entity38 , out of the top four and now in desperate need of an improbable recovery in the @entity21			1
on what we have all seen so far this season , who would bet upon them turning the tables ? the @entity0 of seasons past , maybe			1
the @entity0 of sir @entity49			1
the snarling face of @entity51 , the passion of @entity53 , the understated brilliance of @entity55 , the delivery of @entity57			2
and behind it all , the aggression and defiance of @entity60			2
only those characters are no more			2
@entity15 is being haunted by those ghosts of the past			1
there is no snarling , there is no brilliance , there is certainly no delivery			2
win at all costs ? no , what passed before @entity15 ’s eyes in the @entity74 port city was his worst nightmare			1
there was more passion shown on the sidelines by @entity51 on television than there was on the pitch			2
( note to @entity82 : pick a fight that you can win			2
it was an insipid , pathetic excuse of an interview that mirrored the performance			0
) scratching his head : @entity15 rues the defeat by @entity9 and wonders what to do next nowhere to hide : @entity23 ( left ) , @entity91 ( centre ) and @entity93 feel the pain of defeat pointless : @entity15 takes out his frustration at the humiliating defeat on a match official after the match triumph : the @entity9 players enjoy their famous victory over @entity0 as @entity103 ( left ) looks on if we start with the manager , we have to ask : has he become utterly incapable overnight ? of course not			1
here was a man who overachieved at @entity108 , understanding what it took to keep the club fighting it out with the big boys in the top half			0
but the one aspect of the managerial job that @entity15 does not yet possess at @entity12 is the fear factor			1
how many times was @entity49 prepared to stand toe - to - toe in the dressing room and slug it out with his players ? that fear factor , the fear of losing your place , the fear of not playing for one of the world ’s biggest clubs , the fear of being told you are not wanted ...			1
it looks like it does n’t matter to half of them			0
do you know what ? it does n’t any more			0
protected by grotesque contracts , the lack of desire was startling			0
the only two who can escape criticism from wednesday night ’s display were @entity144 and @entity23			0
one has just signed a mammoth new pay deal			0
the other one is off at the end of the season			0
i thought @entity144 was magnificent			0
pointed failure : @entity153 's @entity152 celebrates scoring in the win over @entity0 in the @entity155 @entity38 shock : @entity158 's @entity157 ( second left ) celebrates knocking @entity0 out of the @entity37 at @entity12 mixed emotions : @entity160 go wild after their @entity38 penalty win , while @entity162 suffers but the remainder of it is sub-standard			1
there is an ageing spine to the team			0
ditto the entire back four			0
you can include @entity172 and @entity173 in that bracket , too			1
while i can sit here and say that they are n’t good enough , that does n’t excuse the lack of desire			1
where was it ? where was that team of winners ? let ’s face it , @entity15 may have inherited a poor situation , not helped by the fact that @entity190 , a steady hand on the tiller , departed at the same time as @entity49			1
but he could at least instil some pride in the shirt			0
this is , though , a situation that has been coming			0
the writing has been on the wall for a while			0
yes , people point to the title race last season			1
but let ’s look at the state @entity0 ’s rivals were in			1
@entity206 suffered a hangover from the @entity21			1
their own end of an era			0
@entity210 were n’t anywhere near as strong as they are this year			0
and they look like they will fall short - again			2
and it appears there was a player backlash against @entity215 that did for him at @entity216			0
outspoken : @entity217 has suggested his team - mates are affecting his form by taking up his positions on his way : @entity144 ( left ) is set to join @entity222 imminently getting the boot : it 's looking like @entity93 's final season at @entity12 sub-standard : @entity169 is not good enough for @entity0 , and neither is @entity172 ( right ) how would @entity0 ’s class of 2012 - 13 get on this season ? hmm			1
better , but not winning the crown by a country mile , that ’s for sure			0
the true state of the club was laid bare when @entity235 outclassed them in the @entity237 a couple of seasons ago			0
that really should have set the alarm bells ringing			0
and how many players - apart from the front two - would other top - five @entity155 teams take ? that ’s the level we ’re talking about			1
and @entity206 have just off - loaded one they deem surplus to @entity0			1
what ’s worse is that there is n’t anyone else any better to come in			2
@entity250 / @entity249 is n’t standing injured on the sidelines			0
there are untold reasons @entity0 are struggling			1
but the fact of the matter is the players are n’t good enough			2
the past manager may or may not have known it			0
the current one most certainly does			0
the truth laid bare : the real state of @entity0 was revealed when they lost to @entity235 in the @entity237 in 2012 oscar winner : @entity262 celebrates scoring for @entity263 in that tie what is most chilling is that this situation mirrors the one that @entity268 found himself in when he took over at @entity32 23 years ago			1
a golden generation had passed			0
the @entity270 had to rip it up and start again			0
and the fall - out was painful			2
the rest of football now scents blood			0
the way they did when @entity278 lost its aura			2
that ’s why teams such as @entity282 , @entity158 and @entity108 have emerged from @entity12 with what has been , until this season , once - in - a - lifetime victories			1
@entity268 never really managed to find the right cocktail to replace a generation of giants			2
@entity15 finds himself lagging behind @entity210 , @entity216 , @entity206 and , yes , @entity32			1
on a @entity296 front , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 and @entity292 and the two @entity294 giants would not fear this current @entity0 set - up			1
true leader : @entity0 are missing a great figurehead such as @entity51 , whose snarling face , such a feature of successful past @entity12 teams , is now only seen on @entity303 ( below ) passing judgement on current failings @entity15 needs giants			1
it ’s going to cost			0
but what ’s the alternative ? more mediocrity ? @entity0 need to sign some top - quality players			1
because , at the moment , apart from in one or two cases , they ’re not of the quality the champions have come to expect .			0

@entity0 were beaten 2 - 0 in their @entity21 first *leg* knockout match at @entity9
the *pressure* is mounting on *beleaguered* boss @entity15
players such as @entity169 and @entity172 are n't good enough
@entity0 are well out of the title race and currently sit in sixth place in the @entity155 , *11* points behind fourth place
@entity15 ' men were knocked out of @entity37 third round at home to @entity158
they also lost their @entity38 *semi-final* at @entity12 , on penalties to @entity160
to make things worse for the fans , fourth - placed @entity32 look poised to replace @entity0 in the @entity21
