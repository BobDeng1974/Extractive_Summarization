@entity2 mayor @entity1 's tenure at @entity3 is set to end this november but the billionaire is not yet ready to climb down from his bully pulpit			1
the business mogul turned politician has launched a gun safety crusade in the @entity9 and is bankrolling his very own super pac to support candidates across the nation championing his pet issue			1
the @entity14 turned @entity15 , @entity15 , turned @entity16 has taken on the gun lobby after the tragedies in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity22 by pouring more than $ 10 million so far into his @entity1			1
though he insists he does support the constitutional right to bear arms , with an estimated fortune of $ 25 billion at his disposal , the 71 - year - old appears to be gearing up to take on the @entity29			2
@entity1 is calling for an assault weapons ban and universal background checks campaign : @entity1 ( left in 2007 ) co-founded @entity39 in 2006 to mobilize city leaders to fight gun violence @entity1 's campaign for gun control began in 2006 , when he joined forces with @entity47 mayor @entity46 to establish mayor 's @entity48 or @entity39			1
the executive has donated more than $ 3 million to the advocacy group and hosted numerous summits on what cities can do to curb gun violence			2
under his leadership the group has grown from a core of 15 members to a movement of over 900 mayors from major @entity9 cities			0
the group 's platform includes calls to ban assault - style weapons , execute universal background checks on gun buyers and push for increased law enforcement resources to fight gun trafficking			0
in october 2012 , @entity1 decided to add to the organization 's arsenal with the creation of a political action committee that could offer financial support to candidates across the @entity9 who support stricter gun control measures			1
grassroots : @entity1 's group brought out the star power in december ( left to right : @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 ) to star in a tv commercial advocating for tighter gun control measures in november , @entity1 's @entity86 provided funding for a total of seven races across the country for candidates running for both @entity93 and @entity94 seats and even one contender for the attorney general in @entity97			2
following the tragic shooting in december at the @entity99 in @entity22 that left 26 dead , @entity1 stepped up his campaign to mobilize a grassroots effort			2
he gathered a bevy of @entity104 a-listers to star in a one minute tv commercial to ' @entity106 , ' sponsored by @entity39 , and advocate for @entity107 to move quickly on tighter gun regulation			2
@entity1 's group also produced a 30 second tv spot that aired during the @entity110			2
this february , thanks to more than $ 2 million in funding from @entity1 's pac , @entity112 candidate @entity111 was elected to fill rep. @entity116 's @entity107 seat in @entity117			1
@entity111 , who made gun regulation a top issue on her agenda , successfully beat her five contenders namely @entity123 , a @entity14 who earned an ' a ' score from the @entity29 from her past term in @entity107 , who was targeted by @entity1 's @entity86			1
gun lobby : @entity127 , president of the @entity29 , has downplayed the effectiveness of @entity1 's campaign for increased gun regulation ' the mayor has been clear he will used his resources to support common sense reforms , ' a spokesman for @entity132 , @entity133 , told the @entity137			1
maintaining that the group does support the @entity139 of the @entity9 constitution , mr @entity133 said the mayor 's campaign for gun safety is not a ' zero sum proposition			0
' ' you can be for the second amendment and not for assault weapons			0
you can be for the second amendment and not for background checks			0
' but the @entity29 is crying foul and has labeled the @entity2 a ' fanatic , anti-gun activist			0
' speaking at a @entity155 hunting expo on february 23 , @entity29 ceo @entity153 warned about the ' secret agenda ' behind universal background checks			0
' this is not universal background checks			0
this is universal registration of your firearms , ' he said , claiming registration is the government 's first step before they seek to confiscate weapons			0
@entity29 president @entity127 has also spoken critically about @entity1 's effort and has suggested the mayor 's effort wo n't have a long lasting impact			1
in regards to @entity111 's election after the influx of cash from @entity1 's pac , he said , ' this proves nothing other than that in a four or five person primary , if you spend $ 2 million you outta be able to get enough votes for your candidate to win , ' he said on february 27 , speaking on the @entity29 's @entity185 news show			1
' it 's only meaningful in that you have a fanatic , anti-gun activist who happens to be the mayor of @entity2 and happens to have billions of dollars who has indicated his willingness to spend up to a billion dollars to get his way			0
' ' this is indicative of nothing more than the depth of this man 's wealth and his willingness to spend it			1
' but the mayor has no plans of stopping anytime soon			0
without elaborating on the @entity86 's next move , mr @entity133 said ' geography is not really an issue ' as they survey the landscape for like minded candidates pushing for common sense reforms .			0

@entity1 's third term as @entity211 ends in november
has led gun regulation effort and founded @entity211 's @entity48
business mogul has shelled out more than $ 10 million to fund his new political action committee , @entity132
