by @entity0 a greedy dolphin called @entity2 choked to death after bingeing on fish			1
the animal was found stranded on a beach in @entity7 , north - west @entity8			2
marine experts said its stomach was crammed full of fish - with one lodged in its nasal passages - and died of asphyxiation			1
warning : @entity16 a post-mortem being carried out on the bottle nosed dolphin on @entity20 beach a post-mortem was carried out after the bottle - nosed dolphin was found on @entity20 beach in @entity23 , near @entity24			1
the dolphin had been tagged by the @entity26 and was known as @entity2			2
@entity27 , strandings co-ordinator for @entity8 , who helped carry out the post mortem said : ' its stomach was crammed full of fish , and i do n’t think there would have been room for any more			1
' so when it swallowed this last fish , it must have been pushed back , rolled into a cigar shape and unusually then lodged firmly in the nasal passages			1
' he added : ' i ’ve heard of this happening before but have never seen it			0
the greedy dolphin , known as @entity2 , was found with a whole dab fish in its nasal passages ' in scientific terms it died of asphyxiation			1
' the experts from the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) teams , a department within the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) and @entity50 described the findings of the post-mortem as ‘ unusual ’			0
they found almost a whole dab fish lodged within the inner part of the nasal cavity , almost blocking the airspace , which would have prevented the dolphin from breathing			1
the team , who visited the beach last tuesday , said : ' an adult male bottlenose dolphin was reported stranded on saturday , may 3 , at @entity20 beach			2
' a @entity52 team from the @entity50 attended the stranding site and secured the body from the inter-tidal zone and a field necropsy was carried out			0
' the 3.34 metre adult male was in good nutritional condition , had worn teeth and had probably alive when it became stranded , prior to death			0
' the cardiac stomach was distended with a large amount of recently ingested flatfish and a nearly intact flatfish was also found lodged within the inner part of the nasal cavity , completely blocking the airspace , which would have effectively prevented breathing			1
' this unusual finding was considered to be the most significant during the post-mortem and the provisional cause of death has been given as asphyxiation			0
' a range of samples were transported back to @entity49 , including some for follow up bacteriological , histopathological and toxicological examinations			0
' experts were able to identify @entity2 by matching marks on his dorsal fin to images in their photo id catalogue researchers at the @entity26 ’s were able to identify the animal by matching marks on its dorsal fin to images in their photo id catalogue			2
@entity105 , science officer , said : ' we know that @entity2 spent time in the southern part of @entity26 in the summer and autumn of 2011			0
' we also know from two photographs taken of @entity2 four months apart that he was involved in a fight at that time , because the second photo shows teeth marks on his fin that were n’t there in the first			0
these marks were a key feature we used to identify @entity2			0
