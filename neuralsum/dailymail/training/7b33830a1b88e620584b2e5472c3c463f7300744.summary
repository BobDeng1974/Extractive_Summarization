@entity0 is feeling the love from fans of other clubs as he attempts to defy the odds and keep @entity5 in the @entity6			1
the @entity5 have the smallest budget of any team in the top flight but go into the final 12 games of the season separated from safety only by goal difference			1
@entity5 have covered more miles than any other team this season and matched the global superstars of @entity17 and @entity18 away from home with a squad consisting predominantly of @entity22 and @entity23 players			2
@entity5 manager joins his squad in applauding their travelling fans after the 1 - 1 draw at @entity18 if @entity0 was in any way concerned @entity30 ' controversial clash with @entity31 at @entity32 last weekend might harm @entity5 's appeal , he would have been reassured by a trip to the @entity35 on tuesday			1
he said : ' i was at @entity17 the other night and there were loads of @entity17 fans coming up saying , '' i hope you do it			0
" ' there 's a story behind the story			2
written off at the beginning of the season , written off after game 10 , and i think there is a stiff - upper - lip mentality to that with @entity22 fans			0
@entity52 celebrates @entity54 's ( right ) equaliser against @entity18 at @entity32 last saturday ' that underdog spirit and bulldog spirit , back in the day			2
i think it 's still there , it just needs igniting once in a while , and maybe people deem us to be part of that			2
' @entity5 are back at @entity65 this weekend , with @entity66 the visitors fresh from their victory over @entity69			1
the @entity5 gave @entity69 a scare at @entity71 earlier this month before slipping to a 3 - 1 loss and then fought back from a goal down to draw 1 - 1 at @entity32			1
@entity0 admitted it has been hard to take that @entity5 's performances have not been rewarded with more points			1
@entity0 expects @entity30 to react well to the furore caused by his clash with @entity31 @entity30 goes in for a two - footed challenge on @entity18 during the 1 - 1 draw at @entity32 he said : ' particularly the last few weeks , i think we 've been operating at a very high level			2
and yet , we 've got a couple of points out of three games			0
' i 'm surprised but that 's the nature of the @entity6			2
it 's very tough to win			0
the next one comes and we 'll be ready for it for sure			0
we 're in good shape mentally and physically			0
' i think we 've got complete freedom to go hard for the next 12 games and see where it takes us			1
' because of @entity5 's size relative to their rivals , @entity0 has been able to instil belief and expectation into his side while playing the underdog card to dismiss any talk of pressure			1
winger @entity103 said : ' everyone ruled us out last year and said we had no chance of getting promotion and we did that			0
@entity0 , animated on the touchline at @entity32 , is determined to keep the @entity5 in the @entity6 ' this year before we even started everyone was saying we were going to get relegated , we were going to be way off the mark , and we 've proved we 're still in the mix , and that 's after not winning in the first 10 games			1
' we 've definitely shown people we 're a decent side but we might as well keep that underdog tag and build on it			0
' @entity66 was @entity5 's first away trip of the season , with @entity121 's first - half goal clinching a 1 - 0 win for the hosts			1
' from that day , we believed we were @entity6 players , ' said @entity103			2
@entity66 are next up for @entity5 , who defeated @entity69 2 - 1 in the @entity6 last saturday ' we took our time getting our first win , but once we got that we 've really built on the confidence around the place and feel that we 're growing			1
we just need to start turning those performances into wins			0
' @entity103 has had to bide his time , with @entity0 's fondness for a consistent side limiting him to only eight starts this season , but he looks set for a run in the team after @entity140 's campaign was ended by a cruciate ligament injury			1
@entity103 replaced @entity142 in the 2 - 2 draw against @entity144 two weeks ago and kept his place for the games against @entity69 and @entity18			0
he said : ' i 've been pleased with my last two performances			0
obviously it 's been a bit frustrating , i have n't played as much as i 'd like			0
it 's taken @entity140 getting injured for me to play , which is not nice , but i 've got to take that opportunity and hopefully i can stay in the team until the end of the season			0

@entity5 are currently 18th , inside the @entity6 relegation zone
the @entity5 are in the drop zone by goal difference with 12 games to go
