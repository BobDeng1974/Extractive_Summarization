by @entity1 reporter the @entity2 is holding its first hearing on a bill that would have to end its killer whale shows and remove 10 orcas from their tanks			2
the bill , number @entity9 , comes as a result of the @entity14 documentary ' @entity12 ' which delved into the aggression of one of the male whales that led to a trainer 's death			1
the bill 's backers say killer whales are too large and intelligent for captivity , while @entity24 says the animals are well treated and help conservation through research			1
@entity24 calls the film anti-captivity propaganda			0
the bill was put forth by @entity48 assemblyman @entity47 and also bans the import and export of orcas			0
under his measure , @entity24 could keep the animals it has in a larger sea pen until they die			2
the tuesday hearing comes days after a seperate court hearing in @entity57 connected to their ongoing battle against rival @entity60 revealed that the animals have been put on psychoactive drugs akin to @entity64			1
under scrutiny : a documentary released last year has led to a flurry of accusations of animal cruelty as well as the dangers of keeping the killer whales in captivity the orcas are dosed with benzodiazepine , which is designed to quell anxiety and commonly causes users to become drowsy			1
prolonged use has been proven to cause panic attacks , out - of - body experiences , and muscle spasms			0
the allegations were confirmed by former @entity24 vice president , now president and ceo of @entity84 , dr @entity85 in a statement to the court			0
dark side : the documentary detailed a number of trainer deaths through the years @entity92 told @entity93 ' the end is near ' for @entity24			2
in a statement , the animal rights organisation said : ' @entity24 is in deep trouble and hot water since @entity12 showed the mental anguish of orcas taken from the great oceans and trapped for eternity in @entity24 's swimming pools â € “ and now court documents have revealed that @entity24 also pumps these marine slaves full of psychotropic drugs in order to force them to perform stupid tricks			1
' if @entity24 executives were locked up within our prison system , they would experience luxurious accommodation in comparison to those of the highly social , intelligent marine animals they imprison , which cause them to lash out , chew their own teeth to the nubs and attack their trainers			0
the park suffered long - term damage after the release of the 2013 documentary , which set out to investigate how animals react to life in captivity and became a critical examination of @entity24 's treatment of whales			1
for 12 months after the film 's january release , the park was hit with cancellations from high - profile performers and school field trips , as well as aggressive animal activist campaigns			0
in december , the @entity139 - based marine park attempted to salvage its reputation by placing full - page adverts in eight of the country 's largest newspapers , rationalising their whale practices .			0

new bill up for debate would ban the import or export of killer whales and would force @entity24 to keep the animals in a bigger pen
@entity154 in @entity155 says the animals are too large and smart to be held in captivity
@entity24 has been fighting animal rights issues for years but the debate came to a head last year with the release of the documentary ' @entity12 '
new bill comes days after a separate lawsuit revealed that the animals are kept on psychoactive drugs to keep them calm
