by @entity0 for @entity1 following the departure of @entity4 to @entity5 , @entity2 is on the hunt for a new centre - back to bolster his defensive options			1
@entity9 may have arrived from @entity10 , with the 19 - year - old putting in a couple of fine displays so far against @entity14 in the @entity15 and @entity16 in the @entity17 , but @entity2 is determined to add extra cover in the position			1
targeted , then , is @entity21 defender @entity20			1
here , @entity22 runs the rule over the @entity25 international to assess whether he is the right fit for @entity27			2
runner : @entity29 ( right ) chases the ball against @entity32 's @entity31 tussle : the @entity25 champions faced the @entity36 giants during the @entity37 in pre-season age : 23 born : @entity40 , @entity41 career : 2009 : @entity43 2009 - 12 : @entity44 2012 - present : @entity21 international career : 13 caps kostas who ? @entity29			1
he ’s 23 , a centre - back			1
he ’s a good height for a centre - half , too , 6ft 2ins			1
he currently plays for @entity21			2
his uncle is @entity53 , who played 71 times for @entity41			0
why do @entity27 want him ? first and foremost they are in need of a centre - back following @entity4 ’s departure to @entity5			1
secondly , he ’s actually quite good			0
he ’s got @entity60 experience with @entity21 which is obviously a big attraction for @entity2			1
his performances for @entity41 during the @entity62 were promising , too , particularly against @entity63 and @entity64			2
for a tall guy , he ’s no slouch either , which will be important in the rapid world of the @entity17			0
tussle : @entity29 fights for the ball with @entity70 during the @entity60 last season seems like a no brainer then ? not quite			2
he ’s spent his entire career playing in @entity41 ; not the most competitive league in @entity77 football			0
so while he has produced top performances in the @entity60 and @entity62 , he has n’t produced consistent performances in one of the continent ’s top leagues			2
so what ’s his background ? he began his career at @entity86 , making his first team debut as an 17 - year - old in 2009			1
but he did n’t stick around at @entity86 for long			0
he was quickly scouted by his uncle @entity89 , who was technical director at @entity44 at the time			0
and in june 2009 , he signed a three - year contract with the @entity25 giants			1
‘ i am very happy signing for the team i support , hopefully i can be a legend at the club like my uncle and end my career at @entity44			0
’ in his first seven matches for @entity44 , he was voted man of the match for five of them			0
he helped @entity44 to the @entity101 in 2011 , before moving to @entity21 in 2012			0
world stage : @entity29 impressed during the @entity62 with @entity41 if he is that good why has n’t he move earlier ? he ’s certainly had interested parties			1
then @entity105 manager @entity104 was interested in taking @entity29 to @entity106 in january 2012 , saying : ‘ @entity29 has huge talent and is a player of the future			0
’ but @entity29 was reported to have turned down a move to @entity111			0
and the links to the @entity17 have not gone away			0
@entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 were all after the 23 - year - old in january , while @entity117 have been credited with an interest this summer			1
@entity27 heading in the right direction - @entity119			2

@entity21 defender @entity121 would be a good addition to @entity27 's squad
the 23 - year - old *excelled* for @entity41 in run to the last - 16 at the @entity62
@entity27 after a new centre - back following @entity4 departure
@entity29 has @entity60 experience with the @entity25 champions
