by @entity0 for @entity1 pudding the fox has abandoned the call of the wild and has almost become a pet at a rescue centre in @entity7			1
the three - year - old vixen was abandoned by its mother in @entity10 and has become so tame that that it can never be released into the wild			1
instead , she has become a fixture at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity7			2
speaking to @entity32 , @entity22 of the @entity14 said : ' pudding came to us from @entity10 , hence the name pudding			1
she was found on her own at a very young age			0
' mr @entity22 said the original plan was to try and release pudding into the wild by integrating her with a litter of cubs and get her accustomed to foraging for food			0
but instead , the fox prefers human companionship and all efforts to convince her to move out failed			2
a large tree fell , which prevented pudding meeting the other fox cubs at a vital time in her development			0
pudding has even appeared on television in the @entity59 and has a growing legion of fans on @entity29 despite his success in taming pudding , mr @entity22 said the best place for foxes is the wild he added : ' pudding had no cubs to integrate with and bonded more with me			1
' however mr @entity22 does not advise other people to try and tame a fox as ' they are wild animals and that is where i believe they should be '			0
the @entity14 is a voluntary organisation which has been rescuing injured and sick foxes for more than 20 years			2
they also help treat foxes suffering from @entity77 .			0
