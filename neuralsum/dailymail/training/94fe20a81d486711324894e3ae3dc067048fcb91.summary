by @entity1 reporter published : 12:17 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 13:22 est , 20 december 2012 a couple are looking forward to an extra special @entity3 this year , after their daughter 's miraculous recovery from a stroke at the tender age of three			1
doctors feared @entity11 could have permanent brain damage after she had the rare brain bleed while out shopping with her father @entity14			1
thankfully the prompt actions of the emergency services meant @entity11 made a full recovery and she is now looking forward to a festive family celebration			1
@entity11 , 4 , and her mother @entity19 are looking forward to an extra special @entity3 after @entity11 survived a stroke and heart surgery mother @entity22 from @entity23 , @entity24 , said : ' we just feel so thankful			1
every time i cuddle her i think " what would i have done without her ? " ' we keep saying all the time that it 's going to be a good @entity3 this year			1
it could have been so different			0
' if we had n't got her to the hospital so quickly in the air ambulance she might have been left brain damaged and sitting in a wheelchair this @entity3			1
' a stroke is a sudden disruption to the blood supply of the brain			2
they are rare in childhood , affecting just 300 children in the @entity43 every year			0
around half of those who suffer a stroke , like @entity11 , will have an underlying medical condition			1
but the other half will have been apparently healthy beforehand			0
strokes can affect many things including a child â€™s movement , speech , behaviour and learning			0
however , in the majority of cases these effects are mild			0
no two children recover in exactly the same way after a stroke			2
@entity62 will depend on the area of the brain affected , and what caused the stroke in the first place			2
treatment includes medication such as blood thinners and physiotherapy			0
@entity11 's ordeal began when she started vomiting while in town with her father @entity14			1
mr @entity75 took his daughter home to bed thinking she had food poisoning , but her condition quickly worsened			1
mrs @entity11 said : ' he brought her home and then she went limp and her eyes kept rolling back and he phoned an ambulance			1
' i had been at work and when i got home she was lying at the bottom of the stairs			0
my first thought was that she had fallen down the stairs			2
' the ambulancemen knew straight away			0
when she got to @entity92 they did an mri scan and sent it to @entity94 in @entity95			1
they said " we want her here now "			0
' when i heard she was going in a helicopter i knew how serious it was			2
' @entity14 and @entity19 had to travel by car because an anaesthetist had to accompany @entity11 in the helicopter , keeping her in an induced coma			1
' we did n't know if she would be dead or alive when we got to @entity94 so it was really scary , ' mrs @entity22 said			0
' the transfer time was critical			0
with strokes from the point of collapsing you only get about three hours to eradicate the bleed and stop it spreading			0
' the family then had a long anxious wait for @entity11 to come around from the coma			1
until she awoke doctors could not say if the bleed on the right hand side of her brain would have left her permanently disabled			0
mrs @entity11 said : ' i sat by her side and did n't know if she would recognise me or would be able to speak			1
' she opened her eyes and looked at me and said ' i 'm hungry '			0
they brought her some toast and she was only using her right hand side , but i knew she was still my @entity11 when she said ' that 's yummy yum pots '			1
' fighting fit : luckily @entity11 did not suffer any permanent disability after having a stroke the youngster had to re-learn how to walk but within a week she ran out of the hospital			1
@entity11 , who has since had her fourth birthday , was later found to have a narrow main aorta to the heart , causing high blood pressure			1
she has since undergone a heart operation and had a stent fitted to widen the artery			0
now she has to wear a special boot at night to keep her left foot straight and will need more heart surgery when she outgrows the stent in a few years time			0
she is happily attending pre-school in nearby @entity141 where big sister @entity142 is a pupil			0
mrs @entity11 said : ' we were very , very lucky thanks to the fantastic care we had from so many people			2
i just wish i could line them all up and thank them			0
' @entity149 , the boss of @entity150 , said : ' we are all delighted to learn that @entity11 has made such a fantastic recovery			2
' her condition was absolutely time - critical and our helicopter was able to make the journey in only 40 minutes			2

@entity11 's father thought she had food poisoning after she fell ill during a shopping trip
she was rushed to hospital after her condition worsened and an mri scan *revealed* she had suffered a stroke
she was then sent by helicopter to a specialist hospital where surgeons managed to stem the bleeding
the youngster had to re-learn how to walk but within a week she ran out of the hospital . her family are now looking forward to a special @entity3
