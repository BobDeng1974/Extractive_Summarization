by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:11 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 06:25 est , 12 february 2013 @entity2 told the court today that months before she stabbed him to death , she caught her boyfriend @entity2 pleasuring himself while looking at pictures of young boys			1
that admission came nearly a year after he had given her a packet of boy ’s @entity15 underwear for @entity17 , saying that he found it ' hot ' when she wore them during sex			1
monday was one of the most explosive days of testimony in her ongoing murder trial , as she told the jury in the @entity25 , @entity27 courtroom about how she discovered his ‘ deviant ’ sexual interest a long time after they had started their sexual relationship			2
he then gave her a porcelain angel figurine , calling her ‘ his angel ’			0
later after leaving the house , she realized she forgot the figurine and she turned her car around to go back to get it			0
when she went back into the house , she did not see or hear @entity44 until she walked into his bedroom and found him pleasuring himself on the bed			1
‘ i got really embarrassed , even though we 'd been intimate more times than i can count , ’ she told the courtroom			2
he then allegedly tried to collect the pieces of paper that were surrounding him on the bed before she could see what they were , but one fell at her feet and she saw that it was a picture of a young boy in his underwear			2
she did not recognize the boy , and only said that he looked to be about five or six years old			0
‘ i was frozen there for a minute - well , maybe not a whole minute - i did n't know how to react , ’ she said , going on to say that she ran out of the house and into her car			0
once she arrived home , she rushed to the bathroom and threw up			0
but she also claimed that they had sexual relations that night because she thought that it would ‘ help ’ him			0
choked up : @entity42 told the court that she saw @entity2 pleasuring himself while looking at pictures of young boys in their underwear throughout the day ’s testimony , her defense attorney continually asked why various incidents during her relationship with @entity44 did not prompt her to cut ties with him all together			1
since @entity42 , 32 , has claimed that she killed the then - 30 - year - old man in self defense , the attorney is likely using her time on the stand to paint a picture of a battered woman who felt compelled to return to a complex relationship			1
one of those points , addressed earlier in the day , was when she alleged that he had sex with her while she was sleeping			2
another was on february 14 , 2007 , when she received a box of @entity17 presents from @entity44 which included chocolates , a t - shirt and panties with his name on it , and a packet of @entity15 underwear			1
she claimed her later discovery of him with the pictures of young boys helped her understand why he thought it was ‘ hot ’ for her to wear the children ’s underwear			1
she added that she was forced to alter the underwear because the leg holes were too tight and that she had been ' confused ' by @entity44 's request			2
@entity44 repeatedly had anal sex with her while she was wearing the children 's underwear , @entity42 said			1
stares : the sisters of victim @entity2 have been present each day of trial and have rolled their eyes and looked away as @entity42 testifies disbelief : @entity136 ' sisters and his friend looked incredulous as @entity42 told the court about his alleged ' deviant ' interests ‘ he preferred sex with women , it made him feel normal , more normal , ’ she told the court			1
‘ it 's hard to describe this			0
he seemed very ashamed with himself and he did n’t want to be that way it was something he struggled with			0
it ’s not who he wanted to be its not who he wanted to be in the future ... when he had sex with women he felt more normal and it was preferable to his other deviant urges , i guess you could say			1
’ @entity42 also testified on monday about the first time she had sex with @entity44 in may 2007			1
she said that she had been asleep and awoke to him having vaginal sex with her			0
throughout the trial , @entity42 has differentiated between vaginal and anal sex , because she believed that vaginal sex went against her @entity170 vow of chastity before marriage , while anal and oral sex qualified as a ‘ grey area			1
’ she said that during the may 2007 tryst , he forced her to perform oral sex on him but at no point did she tell him to stop because ' she loved him			0
' @entity42 also told the packed court room that @entity44 had a violent temper			1
on monday she specified that he had been physically violent with her on at least four different occasions , either grabbing her wrists or slamming her onto the bed during an argument			0
damage : @entity42 held up her finger to show the courtroom what happened after @entity44 allegedly kicked her in the finger and the rib during an altercation the most extreme of those cases ended with her on the floor as he allegedly kicked her in the ribs and hurt her finger			1
she said that rather than seek medical treatment for the finger , which she believes was broken , they made a makeshift splint			0
in court , she held up her hand to show how it is scarred bent even today			0
‘ i would have never called the police on @entity136 , ’ she said while talking about the incident when he kicked her in the ribs and hand			0
‘ i could n’t imagine doing something like that			0
‘ it would have felt like treachery , i would n't have betrayed him			0
i was loyal to him			0
’ emotional : @entity42 wept in court on monday as she was shown photographs of her with @entity44 on trips and at parties earlier in the day , she said that their relationship showed strains in the beginning , as she confronted him after finding text messages from other women just a few months after they began dating			1
several months later in 2007 , @entity42 moved to @entity223 and although the couple remained broken up , they continued to have a clandestine relationship			2
around this time , @entity44 paid @entity42 to clean his house because she had money troubles			1
she claimed he wanted sex while she cleaned and would suggest she wear a @entity232 maid 's costume			2
the murder suspect also described the fantasies that @entity44 would act out upon her			2
she told the jury on monday that on several occasions , he drove up to her house and ejaculated on her face while she was on the porch of her home			0
she said that on one occasion , he threw a @entity243 candy bar at her after he did so			0
anger : @entity245 ( pictured right ) , a friend of murder victim @entity2 , has said that she believes @entity42 is lying on the stand ' i could n't help feeling i was kind of like a prostitute , ' she added			1
' but i chalked it up to one of his little antics			0
' she said that around this time , the number of their sexual ' antics ' increased			0
@entity42 also said that during their casual relationship , they had sex on the freeway while he was driving			1
@entity2 's sisters sat in the front row of the gallery today and glared at @entity42 on the stand throughout her testimony , repeatedly rolling their eyes when she made allegations against their dead brother			1
@entity42 's mother was in court today as she has been throughout the lengthy trial along with her father who was sitting in for the first time			2
@entity278 's brother @entity277 was also seen but appeared to have left the room during his sister 's testimony			2
friends of murder victim @entity2 have spoken of their anguish following @entity42 ' testimony last week			1
strain : @entity2 ' mother appeared in court today with her father - he sat in for the first time ( right ) support : @entity2 's mother leans on her younger brother @entity277 as they appear her murder trial in @entity27 today a close friend of the late mr @entity44 , @entity245 , told @entity294 : ' she is scary because you know she is lying about something , but you almost think she believes her own lies because she is selling it so effectively			1
' ms @entity245 added : ' he always told me she was a nymphomaniac and super sex - crazed , so i am assuming what ever happened it was n’t all him – but that is assuming what she says actually happened ! ' @entity42 and her defense team have sought to paint @entity44 as a manipulative and controlling sexual deviant			1
@entity42 admits she killed @entity44 , whom she had dated for about five months in 2007 , at his @entity223 home in june 2008			1
the prosecution claims she carried out a pre-planned attack as she was jealous of his relationships with other women			0
happier times : @entity42 is accused of stabbing and shooting @entity2 in his @entity223 home in 2008 she initially claimed she had nothing to do with the attack , before changing her story to say she watched two people kill @entity44 before finally settling on self defense			1
she told the court last week how she was abused by her parents as a child , and how @entity44 failed to acknowledge their relationship or touch her in public			2
she claimed that behind closed doors it was the opposite ; despite his position as a @entity170 elder who baptized her , he forced her into unwanted anal sex , claiming that vaginal sex was ' not allowed '			2
after the incident and other earlier unwanted sexual encounters , she felt ' kind of stupid ' , ' bummed out ' and ' like a prostitute , sort of '			0
if she is convicted , she faces the death penalty .			0
