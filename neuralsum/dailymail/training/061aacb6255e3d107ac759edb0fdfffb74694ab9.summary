a baby has overcome a one - in - five - million brain condition – after a blob of medical superglue saved his life			1
just weeks after he was born , @entity5 was diagnosed with rare condition called @entity7 , and needed life - saving surgery to relieve pressure in his brain			1
surgeons performed a technique to plug a leak in his brain which would have killed him if left untreated , using @entity14 , a medical form of superglue			1
he has now made a full recovery and is back at home with his parents in @entity19			0
@entity21 , 26 and her partner @entity20 , 46 , were terrified when their baby @entity5 , now five months old , was diagnosed with a rare and serious condition called @entity7 @entity25 underwent a six hour operation to relieve pressure in his brain			1
doctors blocked off a malformed vein using @entity30 , a medical form of superglue			1
he is now recovering at home with his parents doctors told @entity25 's parents there was a two - thirds chance he would survive the operation , but he would die without it mr @entity5 ( pictured left with baby @entity25 ) and ms @entity21 ( pictured right with her son ) rushed 200 miles from their home to a hospital in @entity45 , where they were told @entity25 would need life saving surgery			1
ms @entity21 said : ' we had no idea if he was going to make it and i did n't want to leave his side			0
' @entity25 , who is now five months old , was diagnosed in august after a health visitor noticed the circumference of his head was 43.2cm , which is 2cm bigger than an average baby			1
his mother @entity21 , 26 , from @entity58 , @entity19 , said : ' who knew that measuring @entity25 's head would save his life			1
' he had no other symptoms of the condition , so we 're lucky that @entity65 , the health visitor , spotted it			1
' at first , we brushed it off , because he 'd always had a big head , but now i 'm glad we listened			0
' ms @entity21 took @entity25 to @entity70 in @entity58 , where doctors agreed his head was big but , unconcerned , sent him home			1
the next morning , ms @entity21 , who works at a care home , received a phone call from a second doctor asking that they return that day for an ultrasound to rule out anything concerning			0
this time doctors found fluid on @entity25 's brain and realised the situation was serious			1
ms @entity21 said : ' the next thing i knew , we were transferred to @entity87 in @entity88 where @entity25 had further scans			2
' at just six weeks old , @entity25 was diagnosed with @entity7 , a rare brain condition that only affects 10 - 12 babies in the @entity92 every year			1
the vein of @entity94 is the brain ’s major vein , which drains blood from the brain back to the heart			1
sometimes an abnormal connection between a vein near the vein of @entity94 and arteries supplying the brain with blood allows blood to flow rapidly from these arteries into the vein of @entity94 malformation			2
the increased pressure means the blood flows faster and at higher pressure than usual			0
this leads to the @entity94 swelling , which can lead to brain damage			1
as the heart needs to work harder to account for this additional blood flow through the vein of @entity94 malformation , it can also lead to heart failure			1
this in turn can cause an increased workload on the lungs , liver or kidneys , which may cause them to fail as well			0
the symptoms vary from child to child when they develop symptoms of a vgm			0
some children develop problems soon after birth , while others develop them later in childhood			0
sometimes children do not run into problems until later in life			0
if this is the case , possible symptoms are an enlarged head , seizures ( fits or convulsions ) , or , rarely , bleeding into the brain			2
in the @entity92 , between 10 and 12 children are diagnosed with @entity7 each year			1
source : @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity92 the condition occurs when missing capillaries in the brain increase the blood pressure , meaning the brain has less time to absorb nutrients			1
the increased pressure leads to the brain 's major vein , the @entity7 , swelling , with often devastating results such as heart failure or brain damage			1
shocked , ms @entity21 called her partner @entity20 , 46 , who rushed to the hospital			0
' we were really panicking , ' ms @entity21 said			0
'' the consultant told me @entity25 's condition could cause heart failure and said it would have killed him had it gone undiagnosed			1
' it was really serious , they were very concerned for his wellbeing			0
' i was shocked at the diagnosis			0
my baby was tiny , he was going through so much and i was thinking the worst			0
' for the first - time parents , the next two days were extremely frightening			0
the couple were transferred 200 miles to @entity179 in @entity45 , so @entity25 could see international neuro - radiologist dr @entity180			2
ms @entity21 said : ' when we left for @entity183 , all i had with me were my pyjamas			0
' at that point , we had no idea if he was going to make it and i did n't want to leave his side			0
' the next morning , dr @entity180 explained @entity25 would need life - saving surgery to decrease pressure in his brain			1
ms @entity21 said : ' we were so worked up			0
@entity25 only had two - thirds chance of surviving the operation , but he would die without it , so we had no choice			2
' during the operation , dr @entity180 blocked off the malformed and swollen vein of @entity94 in @entity25 's brain by going through a vessel in his groin which led there			1
he blocked it off with a blob of glue called @entity30 , similar to superglue			2
the six hour operation was a success and a day later , @entity25 was back to his normal self			2
now he is back home and is thriving , although he will need check - ups for the rest of his life			2
ms @entity21 said : ' we could n't be happier			0
looking at him , you 'd think there had never been anything wrong			0
it feels like a dream			0
' we never thought superglue could be used in that way and i 'd never heard of such a technique			0
' but we just want to thank @entity65 and dr @entity180 as without them , @entity25 would n't be here			2
' ms @entity21 also praised the @entity224 for their efficiency and care			0
dr @entity180 , a neuro - radiologist , is pictured with @entity5 after his six - hour operation in @entity179 , @entity45 she said : ' everything was sorted so quickly and the nurses were brilliant , they made us feel at home and even let us sleep in the one of the wards			2
they cared for and supported us as well as @entity25			2
' dr @entity180 said the condition is extremely rare , and was surprised that @entity25 recovered so quickly			1
he said : ' in the @entity92 just 10 to 12 babies are diagnosed with the condition every year and usually within the first few hours of being born			0
' it 's extremely rare and a one in five million condition			2
' @entity25 was diagnosed at six weeks without any symptoms , which is unusual , but his good health otherwise meant he recovered quickly			1
' had @entity25 's condition not been found , i think his brain would have started to suffer and become progressively damaged , leading to death or very serious brain damage			1

a health visitor noticed @entity5 ' head was 2cm bigger than average
at just six weeks old he was diagnosed with @entity252
rare condition leads to the brain 's major vein , the @entity7 , swelling
if left untreated this can lead to brain damage or heart failure
@entity25 underwent life - saving surgery to relieve the pressure
surgeons blocked off swollen vein using a medical form of superglue
