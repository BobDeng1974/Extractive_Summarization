a new record - breaking atomic clock is so precise it neither loses nor gains a second in five billion years - longer than the age of the @entity3			1
the ' strontium lattice clock ' is 50 % more accurate than the previous record holder , the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) quantum logic clock			1
researchers say the clock is so accurate , it can even reveal the effect gravity has on time			1
atomic clocks operate by means of atoms oscillating between two energy levels			0
in the strontium lattice clock , a few thousand atoms of strontium are held in a column of laser optical traps ( pictured )			2
atomic clocks operate by means of atoms oscillating between two energy levels			0
in the strontium lattice clock , a few thousand atoms of strontium are held in a column of laser optical traps			2
scientists detect the clock 's ' ticks ' - 430 trillion of them a second - by bathing the atoms in very stable red laser light			2
the precise frequency of the laser trigger prompts the switch between energy levels			0
the clock was developed in the @entity36 at the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , by a team from @entity6 and the @entity39			1
group leader dr @entity40 said when it was unveiled in @entity42 earlier this year : ' we already have plans to push the performance even more			0
' so in this sense , even this new nature paper represents only a ' mid-term ' report			0
' you can expect more new breakthroughs in our clocks in the next five to 10 years			0
' in terms of stability , the new clock equals the performance of @entity6 's world - leading ytterbium atomic clock			2

' our aim is that we 'll have a clock that , during the entire age of the universe , would not have lost a second , ' @entity40 told @entity83			1
however , the clock has hit a snag - time does n't pass at the same rate everywhere on @entity3			1
the watch of the future ? @entity36 scientists say the ' strontium lattice clock ' is 50 % more accurate than the previous record holder , the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) quantum logic clock			1
the speed at which time passes depends on the strength of gravity , part of @entity98 's theory of relativity , and it is a very real effect			1
if you take a clock off the floor , and hang it on the wall , @entity40 says , ' the time will speed up by about one part in 1016			1
' the new clock , however , is sensitive enough to spot this			0
' lift it just a couple of centimeters and you will start to see that difference , ' @entity40 says			0
' at this level , maintaining absolute time scale on earth is in fact turning into nightmare			0
' this clock they 've built does n't just look chaotic			1
it is turning our sense of time into chaos			0
' the answer , @entity40 claims , is to send these new clocks into space .			1

clock will *remain* accurate longer than the age of @entity3
named by @entity133 book of records as most accurate clock
team found time does n't pass at the same rate everywhere on @entity3 *due* to gravity
say the only answer may be to *put* a clock in space
