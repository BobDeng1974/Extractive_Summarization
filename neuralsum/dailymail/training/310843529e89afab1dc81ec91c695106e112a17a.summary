it was business as usual for @entity2 on the opening day of @entity4 , as the @entity5 began the defence of his men 's singles title with a straight - forward victory over @entity10			1
the @entity12 no 1 admitted he had been nervous about returning to the court where he so memorably won @entity16 gold and became @entity4 champion , but he showed no signs of anxiety as he brushed aside his diminutive opponent 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 in just over two hours			1
@entity2 said : ' i thought it was a very high standard of match			1
he was maybe a little bit nervous at the beginning , but the level was very high in the second and third sets			0
i was glad to finish it in three because he was playing very well			0
' it was nice ( to be announced as the defending champion )			0
i was nervous this morning and on sunday and walking to the court brings back lots of good memories			2
' i got a nice round of applause but now it 's time to move onto this year and try to play my best			0
' the @entity34 crowd 's warm , appreciative roar to greet their men 's champion when he walked out at 1pm provided a moment to savour from a @entity12 perspective			1
we have waiting a long time for such a moment , after all			0
yet it also seemed to overwhelm @entity10 , who won the toss but elected to receive and , despite earning a break point in the @entity70 's opening service game , was quickly 3 - 0 down and floundering			2
@entity72 defending champion : @entity2 is looking to win the @entity4 title for the second successive year breather : @entity2 wipes sweat off his forehead in between games overwhelmed : @entity10 was outclassed by @entity2 on @entity34 @entity2 's girls : @entity2 was watched by his girlfriend @entity80 ( left ) and new coach @entity81 ( right ) the first set was little more than a procession for @entity2 , who pounced on the @entity10 serve without relinquishing anything on his own			1
the @entity70 has never lost to a @entity85 or a player ranked outside the top 100 at a @entity87 and apparently had no intention of seeing either record on monday			0
@entity10 recovered his composure slightly in the second set , showing more of the graceful elegance that should help him on the grass , but a similar pattern continued			2
@entity2 raced through his service games and @entity10 struggled to win his , giving the 23 - year - old little chance to recover from going a break down early in the set			1
by the third , however , @entity10 had grown in confidence and began to change things up , coming into the net and competing more strongly with @entity2 on his own serve			2
he still made little impact on the @entity5 's serve , but took the set to 5 - 5 before squandering a 40 - 15 lead to finally give @entity2 that precious break of serve			1
the @entity70 wrapped up a comprehensive victory with an ace and then a pump of the fist			1
now onto the next one			0
hello mum : @entity111 was in her customary seat to watch her soon charge through			0

@entity12 no 1 wins 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 in just over two hours
@entity2 wrapped up victory in the third set with an ace
@entity2 admitted to nerves before returning to *centre* court
