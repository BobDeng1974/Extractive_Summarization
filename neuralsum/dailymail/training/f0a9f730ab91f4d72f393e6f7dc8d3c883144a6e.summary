@entity0 confesses to being ' afraid ' as @entity2 's increasingly desperate quest to secure another season in the @entity4 reaches a critical point			1
while @entity0 is convinced victories over @entity7 at the @entity8 on saturday and at home against @entity10 the following weekend will result in survival , he is still racked by nerves			1
the veteran @entity14 manager has never experienced relegation during his 19 - year coaching career and knows @entity2 are close to ending that proud record			1
afraid : @entity0 , who has never been relegated , admits he fears failing at @entity2 ' for me , it ( keeping @entity2 in the @entity4 ) would be my most successful achievement , ' the @entity19 boss said			1
' i have never been relegated and i 'm a bit afraid of the situation , i do n't know how it feels to be relegated			2
' i am always nervous , without nerves you can not bring 100 per cent			0
' the mental side is always the most important thing - the players know how to kick , mentality is what we are fighting for			0
' @entity2 are one point adrift of safety with two matches remaining and @entity0 accepts only two victories will clinch a 14th successive @entity4 season			1
' i still believe two wins will be enough , ' he said			2
tough times : @entity0 has been through a lot already in his short time at @entity2 - now his side need to win not giving up : @entity0 knows @entity44 ( above ) will not allow @entity7 to let up now they are safe ' there is no doubt , we need three points to have the chance to not be relegated			1
' we know @entity7 are a very good team at home , but we are confident that we have developed in the last few weeks and showed against @entity52 last weekend that we are able to play good games			0
' away from home we won at @entity55 and we are confident we can manage it			0
' the atmosphere is very good and the players want to show people we are still alive			0
' both @entity7 and @entity10 have climbed out of the relegation battle , leaving them with nothing to play for this season , but @entity0 denies mid-table opponents signpost an easier route to safety			2
' i do n't think so because if you are safe you have a lot of confidence , so it could be that their payers do better than before , ' he said .			0
