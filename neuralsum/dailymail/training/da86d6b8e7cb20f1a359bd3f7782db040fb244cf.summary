president @entity0 insisted on wednesday that he would not send ground troops into @entity3 combat zones to fight the @entity5 terrorist army , directly contradicting his top general who said a day earlier that the president asked him for boots - on - the - ground recommendations ' on a case - by - case basis			1
' in a gymnasium full of servicemen and women at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity0 seemed also to push back against the political battering he 's taken in recent days , making broad claims of @entity20 's greatness while he 's at the helm			1
' i want to be clear , ' he said , ' the @entity20 forces that have been deployed to @entity3 do not and will not have a combat mission			1
they will support @entity3 forces on the ground as they fight for their own country against these terrorists			1
' ' as your commander - in - chief , ' @entity0 insisted , ' i will not commit you and the rest of our armed forces to fighting another ground war in @entity3			1
' if we reach the point where i believe our advisers should accompany @entity3 troops on attacks against specific @entity5 targets , ' @entity49 said , using an alternative name for the terror group , ' i will recommend that to the president			1
' @entity49 was testifying before the @entity66			2
asked by @entity68 @entity67 sen. @entity67 whether the president had ruled out the use of @entity20 ground forces in a combat role , @entity49 responded , ' yes			1
but he has told me as well to come back to him on a case - by - case basis			0
' he said that if needed , he ' would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of ground forces			2
' but on wednesday @entity0 was single - minded , dismissing all thoughts of putting @entity20 troops in the path of incoming fire			1
@entity20 forces are currently limited to an advisory role , which includes direct contact with @entity3 command centers			1
' we 'll use our air power , ' @entity0 assured his audience of soldiers , drawing his boundaries			2
' we will train and equip our partners			0
we will advise them and we will assist them			0
we will lead a broad coalition of countries who have a stake in this fight			0
' citing both the @entity3 conflict and the emergence of a new ebola virus epidemic in west africa , @entity0 emphasized what he said were ' @entity20 's unique abilities and responsibilities to lead			1
' on monday night the @entity105 announced a deployment of 3,000 ground troops and @entity109 engineers to intervene in @entity110 , a country that has already seen more than 2,400 diagnosed cases and 1,300 deaths from the disease			1
mobbed : the youngest servicemen and women clamored to shake @entity0 's hand and snap photos of the commander - in - chief stars in their eyes : servicewomen wore broad smiles as @entity0 spoke about @entity20 greatness ' it is @entity20 that has the unique capability to mobilize against an organization like @entity5 , ' he said			1
' in a world full of broader social challenges , it is @entity20 that has the unique capability and know - how to help contain and combat a threat like @entity132			2
' and underscoring his mop - up approach to diplomacy and his renewed emphasis on international aid payments , @entity0 said the world is still reliant on the @entity20 to help solve its largest problems			2
' that 's the story , across the board , ' he said			0
' if there is a hurricane , if there is a typhoon , if there is some sort of crisis , if there is an earthquake , if there is a need for a rescue mission , when the world is threatened and the world needs help , it calls on @entity20			2
' ' even the countries that complain about @entity20 : when they need help , who do they call ? they call on us			2
' ' and then , ' he told his military audience , ' @entity20 calls on you			0
' the president 's biggest applause line : ' our reach is long			0
if you threaten @entity20 , you will find no safe haven			0
we will find you eventually ' awkward moment : silence took over when the president boasted that @entity20 troops would be pulled out of @entity173 at year 's end contradiction : gen. @entity49 , the chairman of the military 's @entity50 , told a @entity20 @entity66 panel on tuesday that @entity0 asked him to make ground - troop recommendations ' on a case - by - case basis ' ' this is a moment of @entity20 leadership , ' @entity0 said			1
' and thanks to you , it is a moment that we are gon na meet			0
' aside from his early roll call of the various armed services , @entity0 's biggest applause line was his direct threat to @entity5			0
' whether in @entity3 or in @entity194 , ' the president said , ' these terrorists will learn the same thing that leaders of @entity198 already know : we mean what we say			2
' ' our reach is long			0
if you threaten @entity20 , you will find no safe haven			0
we will find you eventually			0
' less popular was his triumphant statement to the servicemen and women that ' in three months , because of you , our combat mission will be over in @entity173 and our war in @entity173 will come to a responsible end			1
' pausing for applause , @entity0 was met instead by silence â€“ suddenly reminiscent of the tepid response he received during an august 26 speech to the @entity216			0
' that 's because of you , ' he said again .			0

the @entity20 president spoke to servicemen and women at @entity14 in @entity16 after a *briefing* from @entity225 staff
' @entity20 forces that have been deployed to @entity3 do not and will not have a combat mission , ' he promised
that contradicts @entity50 chairman gen. @entity49 , who said tuesday that he would recommend ground troops if necessary
a politically battered @entity0 *pumped* up his leadership bona fides with the claim that ' even the countries that complain about @entity20 ' need @entity20
