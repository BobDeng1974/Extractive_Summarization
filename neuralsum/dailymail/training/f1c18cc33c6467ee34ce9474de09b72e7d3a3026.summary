a jealous wife who tracked down and threatened to kill a topless model after growing tired of her husband ogling the 20 - year - old in a newspaper has been fined £ 6,000			1
the unnamed 51 - year - old , from @entity6 in @entity7 , launched a vicious campaign of hate against the model , identified only as ' @entity10 ' , who regularly appears semi-nude in popular tabloid @entity13			1
a court heard how the woman became fed up with seeing her husband rush out and buy the paper to look at bare - breasted girls each morning			2
a court heard how , at first , she focused her anger on the newspaper 's editor , sending him increasingly vile hate - mail demanding @entity10 , among other models , be dropped			1
' i do n't want to see any more naked breasts in the paper , ' she wrote			2
' otherwise you 're going to find them with their throats cut on a rubbish dump somewhere			1
' she also wrote to various journalists on the newspaper as well as the publishing house itself expressing similar sentiments			0
abuse : shortly after @entity10 ( pictured ) was voted @entity13 's @entity32 , the woman wrote to her , calling her a ' dirty little whore '			1
she also wrote to @entity13 's editor threatening a ' bloodbath ' in its offices ( in background ) but she reserved her most hate - filled vitriol for @entity10			1
shortly after @entity10 was voted girl of the year , the woman wrote to her , saying : ' @entity10 , do you know that you are a dirty little whore			1
' she soon wrote another : ' just on the off chance that you decide to turn up topless in @entity13 again , we are going to kill you			2
we know who you are and what your daily routine is			0
' she even claimed she had hired a hitman to kill @entity10			0
she also turned her attention on @entity7 marketing firm @entity78 , which had advertised alongside the sex - shop chain @entity80 in the daily @entity7 newspaper			0
terrifying : she also told @entity10 , ' just on the off chance that you decide to turn up topless in @entity13 again , we are going to kill you			2
we know who you are and what your daily routine is ' she told them to pull the adverts or face a ' bloodbath ' in one of their branches			0
@entity96 boss @entity95 said : ' one gets used to a bit of criticism but this letter was so hostile it was almost embarrassing			0
' it was only after an intensive police investigation and two years of hate mail that the woman was finally arrested and her motive revealed - jealousy at the fact her husband was looking at the partially - naked women in the newspaper			0
she pleaded guilty to charges of making threats , insults and falsifying documents as well as causing an accident with a car while drink driving on a mountain bike			1
she was ordered to pay a £ 6,000 fine or serve 120 days in prison			0
she can still appeal the verdict .			0

the 51 - year - old , from @entity6 , grew jealous that husband was ogling ' @entity10 '
she was angry he rushed to buy tabloid @entity13 each day to look at nude girls
but when she found out he voted for her as paper 's girl of 2012 , fury grew
she wrote to @entity132 : ' @entity10 , do you know that you are a dirty little whore '
she also wrote to @entity13 's editor demanding he sack all the topless girls
' otherwise you 're going to find them with their throats cut , ' she wrote
she pleaded guilty to making threats , *forging* documents and ' causing a crash while drink riving on a mountain bike '
