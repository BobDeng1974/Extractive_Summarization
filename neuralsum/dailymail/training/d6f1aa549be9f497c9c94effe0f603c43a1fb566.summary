by @entity0 pop icon @entity1 has been criticised for a comeback poster of herself being rescued from the sea which was released as the search continues for missing flight mh370			1
the 55 - year - old singer wears a lifejacket in choppy waters in the image , released yesterday for the long - awaited announcement of her first live gigs for 35 years			1
but the the timing of the poster 's release led some to claim it was inappropriate - for which the singer apologised today			1
' the timing is really unfortunate , ' she said			2
' there is absolutely no connection with the current tragedy that is heading the news and i apologise from the bottom of my heart if this has in any way upset or at all offended anyone			1
' inappropriate ? fans on @entity30 questioned the timing of this photo released to promote @entity1 questions : @entity30 users began to ask about the photo and its unfortunate timing with the search for @entity38 am i the only one ? twitter user @ @entity41 questioned whether the shot was ' a little inappropriate ' missing : the last known image of the @entity45 jet , which is still missing after two weeks apology : the singer explained the origin of the photo today on her website , saying it represented the narrative of her 1985 conceptual piece @entity53 in which a woman is lost at sea in the statement on her website , she added : ' i am rather concerned at some comments that have been passed on to me and i feel i should clarify my position			1
' the image that was chosen to advertise the shows originates from a conceptual piece called @entity53 that was released in 1985			1
' it is about a woman who is lost at sea but is rescued in the end			0
months ago i thought that , as part of the show centres around this musical piece , it would hopefully make a dramatic shot			2
' @entity73 's publicist confirmed the photo was taken before the jet disappeared			2
the photo sparked debate on @entity30 before the statement , where one user wrote : ' she must have shot this pre-publicity photo before the @entity82 jet went missing , right ? ' another said : ' am i the only one who thinks that given the missing @entity86 plane , @entity1 posing in a life jacket at sea is a little inappropriate ? ' one @entity30 user condemned it as ' poor timing ' which should have been picked up while another suggested it might be ' genius marketing ' and a ' conspiracy '			1
others defended @entity73 , who famously avoids the public eye and has not played live since 1979			2
one fan said the criticism was an ' absurd comment ' , another simply wrote ' for f * * * 's sake ' and one rightly speculated that the photo was a hint @entity73 would play her 1985 seven - track concept piece @entity53			1
disagreement : several users questioned the logic of the photo - though one said criticism was ' absurd '			2
another thought the photo could be a hint she would perform seven - track concept piece @entity53 individual style : @entity1 at the height of her fame , left , and when she was made a @entity118 by the @entity119 last year argument : one joked that it was genius marketing and a conspiracy			1
another just said : ' for f * * * 's sake ' the singer will play a 15 - night residency with the title @entity129 at @entity131 's @entity130 in august and september			2
the venue was not chosen randomly - then known as the @entity130 , it was the scene of her last gig on 14 may 1979			0
tickets will go on sale next friday at 9.30am for the dates and booking lines are expected to be indundated			0
if punters buy the maximum allocation of four tickets each , there will be fewer than 14,000 sets available for one of the most venerated @entity146 acts of the last 40 years			0
@entity1 soared to fame in 1979 with her single @entity148 , which she wrote when she was just 18			0
the song based on @entity151 's dark love story of the same name was followed by hits including @entity154 and @entity155			0
no answers : @entity158 officer @entity157 in the search for missing flight @entity38 yesterday media scrum : acting prime minister of australia @entity162 speaks to the media at an airbase in the search shy of publicity , she became respected for her uncompromising individualism and refusal to make pop music in anything other than her own style			0
on her website the singer added : ' i was working all day yesterday and so was totally unaware of the reaction , apart from friends who 'd told me it had all gone bonkers			0
' i am completely overwhelmed and genuinely shocked by the incredibly positive response from everyone			0
thank you ! ' the fate of flight mh370 , meanwhile , remains a mystery two weeks after it vanished between @entity86 and @entity187 with 239 passengers on board			1
despite dozens of theories circulating about its disappearance , there is still confusion over what happened to the jet			0
today @entity198 authorities said they had spotted ' suspicious ' object measuring 72ft by 42ft and floating in the remote search zone of the @entity201 .			0
