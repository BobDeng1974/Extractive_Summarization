true or false ? @entity0 , pictured , says he has built a machine achieving ' cold fusion ' but scientists question if it is possible an @entity6 physicist claims he has managed to achieve ' cold fusion ' - a procedure that could solve the world 's energy crisis by creating huge amounts of safe nuclear energy without dangerous radiation			1
@entity0 says his new machine fuses nickel and hydrogen at room temperature creating almost unlimited energy			1
but there is one problem - many scientists claim it defies the very laws of physics			1
several high - profile demonstrations of ' cold fusion ' have been proven to be hoaxes in the past - and no one can adequately explain how or why it might work			0
the @entity30 the @entity31 say the process is impossible because physics rules out the possibility of room - temperature nuclear fusion			1
but @entity0 's @entity37 machine can allegedly do it , and he says he proved it worked during tests at the @entity41 last month			2
' with low energy , it 's possible to give a heater a certain amount of energy and to get from the same heater a superior amount of energy , ' he said			0
' the heat is initiated by electrical resistance			0
the reactors then produce another @entity53 of energy for another three to four hours without needing that initial electrical input -- the low - level nuclear reaction continues on its own			0
machine : professor @entity0 's e-cat was tested last month and produced huge amounts of non-radioactive energy , he says key : @entity0 says he has produced a pattern of triple track atoms , pictured , which is at the heart of the cold fusion theory ' the test we made by the customer was to see if the process was working properly , and to control whether the energy was in an amount superior to the amount supplied to the system			2
' we have nothing to say , just to make plans that work properly and let those facts win against the scepticism			0
' the idea of cold fusion was put forward by in the 1920s by @entity82 scientists @entity83 and @entity84			0
but despite several people saying they have done it , it has been dismissed by most physicists			0
an atom is a nucleus of protons and neutrons , with electrons orbiting around scientists say that @entity0 's claims must be taken from his lab and analysed before he can claim he has done it			1
energy consultant @entity98 said ' [ the e-cat experiment ] should be treated as a hoax until independent scientists are able to replicate these results , ' but @entity103 , ceo of the alternative energy news agency @entity104 , told @entity105 he attended @entity0 â€™s demonstration and the @entity37 is self sustaining			1
' what @entity0 demonstrated was 470 kilowatts of continuous output in self - sustain mode -- meaning the output was enough to keep the thing running on its own , ' he said .			2

@entity0 says he can fuse nickel and hydrogen at room temperature creating almost unlimited energy
many scientists simply claim it defies the very laws of physics and can not be true
