@entity1 defender @entity0 has moved to dampen down expectations ahead of the @entity4 qualifier against @entity5 at @entity6 on sunday			1
@entity8 's newest member are bottom of @entity10 after four matches with no points and have shipped 21 goals including seven in the matches against @entity15 and @entity16 , without getting off the mark themselves			2
the @entity20 player , however , tried to allay any assumptions of a goal fest and believes patience could be key			1
@entity20 defender @entity0 has warned against complacency ahead of @entity1 's game with @entity27 the @entity1 squad train ahead of their @entity30 qualifier with bottom placed @entity32 on sunday he said : ' i think the pressure that is on us now is to break them down and score the goals because other teams have done that but ultimately it is all about just winning the game			1
' obviously , if you score a lot of goals in front of your home fans and everything is great then it is a perfect afternoon			0
' but these players are no mugs and for me it is all about winning the game and moving on			0
' it will be a difficult game and difficult to break them down and we are preparing as best we can			0
@entity57 's side face a team that is yet to win in four attempts in @entity10 ' the squad has watched bits and pieces on video			1
' obviously they were playing against some good opposition			0
they put men behind the ball in the @entity70 game , the same against @entity71 and @entity15 , so i think it will be much the same on sunday			0
' you have 90 plus minutes in a game so at the end of the day when the final whistle goes you just want to have three points and hopefully the team puts on a good performance			0
' substitute @entity81 ( left ) scored the winner with a late header in the 1 - 0 defeat of @entity85 @entity57 's side go into the game on the back of a 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity85 at @entity6 on wednesday night where it took an 85th minute header by substitute @entity91 to separate the teams			1
@entity0 believes playing against such a stuffy side as the @entity94 were on the night was ideal preparation for a much more important game			1
' the game the other night was a good test for us going in to the @entity5 game , ' he said			2
' at times we struggled to break them down in the final third but we will do our best to break @entity5 down as early as possible			2
