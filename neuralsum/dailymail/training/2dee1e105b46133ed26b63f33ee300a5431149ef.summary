even @entity65 managed to top the @entity67 poll against @entity68 during his hapless period as @entity71 leader			0

mr @entity72 also said @entity97 had stolen a march because it focused on a key voter concern – immigration			0

miss @entity1 , @entity6 's work and pensions spokesman , said she agreed @entity6 had ' more work to do '			1
