@entity0 was once on the end of a major @entity3 injustice while playing for @entity4 - but he can not see any point in his old club writing to the @entity7 over the latest controversy at the national stadium			1
@entity4 issued a statement on monday evening revealing they were ' seeking an understanding ' of the failure to penalise @entity14 defender @entity13 for stopping a goal - bound @entity16 header with his hand			1
@entity4 were leading 1 - 0 at the time but went on to lose 3 - 2 and some fans have questioned how referee @entity21 and additional assistant @entity22 could have missed the infringement			1
@entity4 striker @entity16 has a goal - bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of @entity13 @entity27 of @entity4 appeals unsuccessfully for a penalty before @entity4 crash out @entity0 , pictured at golf charity event , has urged his former club to move on from the injustice @entity0 had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside while @entity4 were 2 - 1 down in an @entity37 final and the @entity38 went on to miss a last - minute penalty that could have sparked extra-time			1
but he refused to dwell on the match officials ' error - and called on @entity4 to move on from the latest setback rather than writing letters			1
' i 'm not sure what sort of purpose it 's going to serve , ' said @entity0 as he launched a ' know your balls ' testicular cancer awareness drive at his charity 's annual golf day at @entity54 in @entity55			2
' it has happened before and will happen again			0
there 's a lot of disappointment at @entity4 and rightly so , it should have been a penalty			2
@entity62 ( 2nd right ) celebrates with team - mates after scoring the late winner in 3 - 2 victory @entity4 pair @entity67 ( left ) and @entity68 look dejected as their hopes of a domestic treble end ' i think the referee just missed it			1
when you are questioning people 's integrity and honesty , that can sometimes go a little overboard			0
the referee just missed a decision , i 'm sure if he 'd seen it he would have given it			2
' it happened to me in 2003 when i scored a legitimate goal against @entity85 at @entity3 in a cup final			2
it was proven to be two yards onside and it got called offside			0
it was a big moment for me			0
' i was disappointed for two days and i got over it , and i think @entity4 will get over it			2
' they feel they have a right to complain , and that 's what they want to do , but i 'm not too sure what they are going to gain by it			0
' @entity0 believes @entity98 can still class his first season as @entity4 manager a success if they go on to clinch the @entity103 title - they can move eight points clear of @entity105 by beating @entity106 at @entity107 on wednesday			1
' i think they will never get a better opportunity to win the treble , ' the former @entity109 striker said			0
' they got the @entity37 final in the bag and they could have played a @entity115 team ( @entity114 ) in the final			0
@entity4 manager @entity98 has criticised an official 's decisions during @entity120 defeat to @entity14 ' so it 's a missed opportunity but i think if you had offered a chance to win a double to a young rookie manager who had not managed anywhere near this level , a lot of people did n't know who he was , i think he would have taken that			1
' when he sits in the summer and has a moment to himself he will probably realise it has been a successful season , tinged with disappointment because he has not joined great managers like @entity137 and @entity138			0
' obviously they have a little work to do to get over the line but they should win the league and they should be fairly pleased			0
