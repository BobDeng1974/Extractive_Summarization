@entity0 was four - and - a - half months pregnant and looking forward to having twins when she received some terrible news - she had breast cancer			1
but the 42 - year - old from @entity5 in @entity6 , refused to have an abortion and was able to battle back to health and keep her precious sons despite undergoing chemotherapy			1
she spoke to @entity11 on the day doctors reported in @entity13 that pregnant women with breast cancer can be treated safely and do n't need to delay treatment until they give birth			1
rocky road : @entity0 had four rounds of chemotherapy during her pregnancy after refusing to abort her twins the team from @entity25 's @entity24 found chemotherapy can be safely given in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy without affecting the unborn baby and , in general , surgery is safe during any of the three trimesters			1
the advice given to ms @entity0 , who was diagnosed back in 2007 was very different			1
she had first felt a lump in her breast in february of that year but had been told it was a benign cyst following a mammogram and ultrasound			1
however , in december she was told it was actually cancer and she faced a terrible decision of life and death			1
she told @entity11 : ' my oncologist recommended an abortion straight away as my cancer was advanced and had spread to the lymph nodes			1
' they told me there was no way of knowing if it had spread into any organs while i was pregnant as i could n't have any of the necessary scans			2
' they wanted me to have a termination within two weeks but after hearing about the procedure i was horrified			0
i could feel my babies moving			0
i thought " i 'll just die of depression if i kill them now			0
" ' so i never went back to that medical practice			0
' relief : @entity59 ( top ) and @entity61 ( bottom ) only spent two weeks in hospital before they reached the 5lb and were allowed to go home aided by the cancer support network @entity67 , ms @entity0 went to see a series of experts including obstetrician dr @entity70 who told her that she could have cancer treatment while pregnant - especially as she was past her first trimester			1
she began a course of chemotherapy at the @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity6			0
but she was still able to enjoy her teenager daughter 's @entity78 - themed birthday celebration with a full head of hair			0
' the stylist pulled off a miracle as it all fell out the next day , ' she said			0
she had four rounds of chemotherapy over 12 weeks , while also taking the drug herceptin			0
by the time she was ready to give birth at the recommended 32 weeks the tumour had shrunk to almost nothing			2
ms @entity0 said she had three specialist doctors on hand during her c - section as they were worried her sons would weigh as little as 2lbs			1
however , however when they were born in april 2008 @entity59 was 4lbs 3oz while @entity61 was 3lbs 12oz			0
' they were strong healthy boys , ' ms @entity0 , who is a manager at a brake systems company , said			1
' the doctors had told me they could be in intensive care for five weeks but they were ready to come home in two weeks ! ' @entity0 : ' @entity102 does n't have to be a death sentence ' fighting fit : @entity61 ( left ) and @entity59 enjoy opening their presents during christmas 2011			1
@entity0 says she is thankful every day for the gift of life now ms @entity0 's treatment could continue in earnest			1
she had a further 10 rounds of chemotherapy using a more toxic combination of drugs			2
thankfully the disease had not spread to any of her vital organs			0
when her sons were six - months - old she had a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction			2
when her chemotherapy finished in january 2009 , mrs @entity0 was ecstatic to be told she was in remission			1
however , she still had to undergo two months radiotherapy treatment and continued to take @entity122 until november 2010			2
ms @entity0 has now been clear of the disease for three years and says she is enjoying every day she gets to spend with her sons			2
' they are four years old now and little terrors ! ' she joked			0
' they are full of energy and they are excited about starting ( a junior form of baseball ) tee ball this saturday			0
' my miracles : @entity0 was relieved to find the cancer had n't spread to her organs while she was carrying her babies in the @entity139 , 5,000 women of reproductive age are affected by breast cancer every year			1
of all cases diagnosed in women aged 30 or under , 10 to 20 per cent take place during pregnancy or in the first year after a birth			0
breast cancer in pregnant women is generally diagnosed later than usual because symptoms are obscured by expected changes to the body such as an increase in cup - size			1
@entity153 a doctor from @entity25 's @entity24 who worked on the @entity13 report , said : ' the new insights we gained during our research facilitate cancer treatment and provide hope for mother and child in most cases			2
' most mothers feel stronger and are even more motivated to undergo the cancer treatment and its side effects , since she is fighting for her child as well			0
' but dr @entity153 admitted that breast cancer in pregnancy ' remains challenging ' because in some situations advanced cancer can lead to death of mother and baby			1
the report said women and their partners should be informed about the treatment available , and that termination of pregnancy did not seem to improve maternal outcome			0
but it said ' the decision to continue or end the pregnancy is a personal one '			0
ms @entity0 said she was keen to tell these women that they did have options			2
' i want women to know that there is hope and that they can save their lives and that of the babies as well , ' she said			0
' @entity102 does nâ€™t have to be a death sentence			0

@entity0 first told she had a benign cyst 10 months before breast cancer diagnosis
