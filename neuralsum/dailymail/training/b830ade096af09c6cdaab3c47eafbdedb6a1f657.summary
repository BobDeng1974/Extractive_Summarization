leaders of three trade unions today decided to call strikes for up to 12 days starting on january 17			2
thousands of employees will be involved at sites across the country and unions said the action will hit production of goods including @entity5 and @entity6			1
workers held a one - day strike last year in protest at the ending of @entity12 's final salary pension scheme			1
tough business decision : the @entity34 headquarters of food group @entity12 , which manufactures such products as @entity5 and @entity6 @entity12 workers from sites at @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 say they are fighting an ' unjustified ' attack on their pensions			1
unite , the @entity50 and @entity51 say the company 's plans to axe the final salary pension scheme will see the retirement income of thousands of staff slashed by up to 40 per cent			1
@entity57 , national officer of @entity58 , said after today 's union meeting in @entity60 : ' it would seem that @entity12 believed the workers would give up after one day 's strike but they are badly mistaken			1
sending out a message : the @entity50 's national officer , @entity65 ' the workforce is angry that the company has refused to meet us or to attend talks at the conciliation service acas			1
' @entity65 , national officer of the @entity50 said : ' @entity12 need to get the message that profitable companies will not be allowed to walk away from their savings commitments to their loyal workforce			2
' mr @entity65 warned of further strikes unless the row is resolved			2
the announcement comes after another leading union leader - @entity78 of the @entity80 - said workers across the country faced a ' pivotal moment ' in their fight against pension cuts			1
mr @entity78 said that if the unions were still united , they should call for another national strike			2
@entity12 issued a statement saying : ' whilst we fully respect the right of our employees to protest about the changes we are planning to make to our @entity94 pensions arrangements , we remain deeply concerned by the disproportionate action the trade unions are taking			0
' this was a tough but necessary choice which reflects the realities of rising life expectancy and increased market volatility			0
' we believe the provision of final salary pensions is a broken model which is no longer appropriate for @entity12			0
everybody out : last year public sector workers carried out a series of strikes			0
could 2012 see similar widespread walkouts ? ' it is our responsibility to protect the long - term sustainability and competitiveness of our business , and to do so is in the best interests of our people			0
' the company added that its new pension plan was ' exceptionally competative ' and only devised after extensive consultation with staff			0
' we believe these significant changes underscore the value and legitimacy of the consultation process which was concluded in early october , ' the company said			0
' it is currently not clear how the dispute with the trade unions will be resolved but we are continuing to urge our employees who have participated in industrial action to give further objective consideration to the very competitive new arrangements			0
' by continuing to offer all of our employees a defined benefit career average pension plan on their earnings up to Â£ 48,000 , we are offering arrangements which are unavailable at most other companies in the @entity94			0
