by @entity0 could radar be the answer to keeping an eye on elderly people without invading their privacy ? that ’s what a team of researchers at @entity9 in @entity10 are aiming to prove with their experiment			1
they say using radar could keep track of older relatives and even detect when they fall over			1
they say it could be used to keep track of elderly people and get them help if needed			1
pictured is a graduate student taking part in the experiment the system uses radar units small enough to fit in your hand			1
they send electromagnetic waves into the surrounding environment			0
as these waves bounce off people and objects they can monitor what is going on in the room			1
the system can tell the difference between some falling and just sitting down			2
if it detects a fall , it sends a signal to mobile phones or relevant people , such as relatives and emergency services			2
the technology is so accurate that apparently it can also monitor the heart rate and breathing of people in the room			1
and it can also pinpoint which part of the room events have happened in , so the response can be swift if needed			0
however , the system is specific to the user , so it is not quite ready to be rolled out en masse yet			2
the algorithms are trained to the motions of one user , but in future this could be generalised			0
right now , according to the researchers , 40 million @entity65 are over the age of 65 , and the @entity68 predicts that by the year 2030 , 80 million @entity65 will be 65 or older			1
due to these rising statistics , families , communities and health care providers are at a cross-road in terms of how to best serve this growing aging population			0
many elderly individuals choose to live alone , which poses a great risk as falls and other ailments become more likely as a person ages			2
in order to increase the safety and security of an elderly person living alone , researchers at @entity9 are examining the use of through - the - wall radar technology to detect falls and monitor the elderly in their individual living spaces			1
graduate students in the @entity92 were trained in walking , falling , and functioning like an elderly person and experiments were conducted in the radar - imaging lab on @entity9 ’s campus			1
@entity97 , a clinical instructor in @entity9 ’s @entity98 and an expert in the growing elderly population , educated and trained the students on how the elderly carry themselves and walk - with or without the assistance of canes or walkers			0
the system works by bouncing radar off people and objects			1
it must be individually tailored to a specific user so it knows if , for example , they have a cane or other form of support			0
it is hoped the system can be generalised to various users in the future though 40 million @entity65 are over the age of 65 , and the @entity68 predicts that by the year 2030 , 80 million @entity65 will be 65 or older			1
due to these rising statistics , families , communities and health care providers are at a cross-road in terms of how to best serve this growing aging population dr @entity128 , director of the @entity129 in the @entity92 , is the principal investigator for the project			0
his research focuses on various applications for radar imaging , including search and rescue , defence , and law enforcement			0
dr @entity128 and his team , through a grant from @entity141 , are now developing a series of algorithms to identify the patterns and routines of an elderly person in his or her home			2
the radar , with the help of these algorithms , can detect when a person is sitting , standing , walking and so on			2
they say detection of motion , and even classification of what sort of motion it is ( such as walking or falling ) , can be achieved in all rooms inside a home with just one or a few radar units			0
‘ @entity163 has become a mature technology , ’ says dr @entity128 in the video			0
‘ @entity163 is becoming faster , less expensive , more compact and more reliable			0
‘ so people have started thinking about transitioning this technology into healthcare			0
‘ in the elderly care the radar looks at the human as a target , so we would like to detect the fall and locate the fall			1
‘ we would like to do so with respect to privacy , and also try to focus on the fact that it should be non-intrusive			0

*scientists* in the @entity65 have developed a system for monitoring elderly people
they say their radar system can be used to track a person *'s* movement
this could be used to monitor if they fall and need help , for example
would provide a way to monitor older people without *invasion* of privacy
the radar system can also monitor the heart rate and breathing of a person
