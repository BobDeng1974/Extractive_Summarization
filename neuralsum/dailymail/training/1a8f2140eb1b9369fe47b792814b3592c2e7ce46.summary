the government 's own watchdogs tried to hack into @entity2 earlier this year and found what they termed a ' critical ' vulnerability — but also came away with respect for some of the health insurance site 's security features			1
those are among the conclusions of a report released tuesday by the @entity12 inspector general , who focuses on health care fraud			1
the report amounts to a mixed review for the federal website that serves as the portal to taxpayer - subsidized health plans for millions of @entity19			1
the government 's own watchdogs say they tried to hack into @entity2 earlier this year and found what they termed a critical vulnerability so - called ' white hat ' or ethical hackers from the inspector general 's office found a weakness , but when they attempted to exploit it like a malicious hacker would , they were blocked by the system 's defenses			1
@entity2 had some advance warning of the hacking attempt — a date range , but not specific times			0
@entity36 spokesman @entity35 said the agency did not take additional precautions during that period			0
the report came on the heels of the massive breach at @entity44 stores , which affected 56 million credit and debit cards			1
the inspector general 's office released a public version that summarizes detailed findings delivered to the @entity51 administration			1
it concludes that more work needs to be done to bolster security			1
last week , the congressional @entity54 released similar conclusions after its own review			1
@entity2 was hacked this summer by non-government employees after the government conducted it 's own tests but the administration said no consumer information was stolen			1
instead , hackers installed malicious software that could have been used to launch an attack on other websites			2
' we have not had any malicious attacks on the site that have resulted in personal identification being stolen , ' @entity66 told @entity71 last week			2
@entity66 , administrator of the @entity72 , told the @entity73 last week that no consumer information was stolen when @entity2 underwent suffered a hack from outside the government this summer @entity36 ' inspector general found that the administration ' has taken actions to lower the security risks associated with @entity2 systems ' and consumers ' personal information since the site first launched			1
but the auditors said they ' remain concerned ' about the use of encryption technology that is not certified to meet certain government standards			2
encryption refers to the encoding of data traveling back and forth between consumers and @entity2 to make it more secure			0
in its formal response , the administration said it has taken other actions to resolve the encryption issue			0
the inspector general 's office tried to break into @entity2 in april and may			2
experts used a technique called ' vulnerability scanning ' and also conducted simulated attacks			0
' scanners simulate an outside malicious attack on the system and may identify ... vulnerabilities that could put a system 's security at risk , ' the report explained			1
' scanners use the same techniques as hackers , so the scanners test the security from an outside perspective			2
' @entity36 itself also runs similar scans regularly , part of its own security program			2
the hackers from the inspector general 's office found one ' critical ' vulnerability , described as a flaw that would let an attacker take over the system and execute commands , or download and modify information			1
but the office said that when its ' white - hat ' experts attempted to mimic what a malicious hacker might try next , they were blocked by the system 's defenses			0
separately , the review also found two critical vulnerabilities in databases that support the website			2
specific descriptions of the flaws were not released , but apparently none has been exploited by hackers			0
@entity2 serves 36 states , while the remaining states run their own enrollment websites			0
the federal site had numerous technical problems when it was launched last fall and for weeks it was unworkable for most consumers			0
at the time , technical experts within @entity36 were concerned that full security testing could not be completed because the system was undergoing so many last - minute changes			0
nonetheless , @entity158 administrator @entity66 issued a six - month security authorization for the site , keyed to an action plan for reducing risks			1
the inspector general 's office also probed security for two state - run health care websites , the @entity168 exchange and @entity170 's small - business portal			1
it found that @entity168 , seen as a national model , sufficiently protected consumers ' personal information			0
but there were some weaknesses in who had access to the system			0
white - hat hacking of @entity170 's site revealed 64 vulnerabilities			0
the office said it will keep monitoring security on @entity2 and state sites .			0

a report released by a @entity12 inspector found that more work needs to be done to bolster security on the site
government watchdogs were otherwise happy , however , with the improvements to security that have been made to the site since its launch
the report follows a real hack that *occurred* on the site this summer
