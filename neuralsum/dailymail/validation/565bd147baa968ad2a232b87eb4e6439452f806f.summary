@entity1 proposals for men ’s @entity3 football at the @entity5 have already been kicked into the long grass by the other home nations — and the women ’s hopes are going in the same direction			1
there were strong hopes that a women ’s team could still represent @entity3 in @entity14 in 2016 when the strength of the opposition for @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 soon made it obvious that the men ’s initiative was a non-starter			1
@entity3 are unlikely to reform for 2016 @entity24 after coming together for @entity25 but the @entity27 countries , having been promised that the two football sides at @entity25 were a one - off , have informed the @entity30 that they see no reason to treat women ’s football any differently because it still threatens their independence — however many times they ’re reassured by @entity35 that it wo n’t			1
the @entity30 will announce imminently that both @entity3 football sides have been scrapped			1
such are football ’s sensitive politics that after @entity35 president @entity39 had praised @entity41 ’s work in his opening speech at the @entity43 in @entity44 , the president of the @entity47 body , @entity48 , left out his one dig at @entity39 contained in advance copies of his speech			1
@entity48 ( right ) seemed to bite his lip during his speech about @entity39 's @entity35 at the @entity43 @entity48 , in an obvious nod to @entity39 ’s regular references to steering the world football ship , was due to say : ‘ i regard myself as a simple team - mate , at most your captain			1
but not the captain of a ship that is being battered by a storm , clinging to the helm for dear life			0
’ but he skipped the bit about ‘ clinging to the helm for dear life ’			0
nothing sums up @entity39 ’s presidential election trickery more than the decision to have a special meeting in @entity71 to decide future numbers of @entity74 places — the day after the @entity43 vote in may			1
this will allow @entity39 at least to make promises about more @entity74 places to the confederations who support him			2
@entity35 say the issue has to be debated afterwards as candidate @entity82 ( right ) has increasing @entity74 participation as part of his manifesto			0
@entity1 return to @entity89 for a friendly against @entity91 after riots saw the last game abandoned in 1995 there is confidence @entity1 ’s powderkeg friendly against the @entity96 at the @entity97 on june 7 — the first time @entity1 have played in @entity89 since a riot forced the abandonment in 1995 — will pass without trouble			1
all the focus in @entity19 is on the crucial @entity104 qualifier with @entity18 on june 13			0
no whitewash for @entity106 there was no surprise about @entity109 being elected @entity111 vice-president on the @entity112 at the @entity43 on tuesay			0
but @entity30 ’ outspoken president @entity113 , who has made increasingly outlandish claims about @entity30 skulduggery , received 10 votes out of 54 which is nine more than many expected			0
meanwhile , @entity106 said that rather than ask ‘ awkward ’ questions of the @entity71 regime which @entity30 chairman @entity120 wants him to do , he will be putting ‘ relevant and appropriate ’ ones			0
@entity82 ( left ) and the more impressive @entity122 are unlikely to oust @entity39 as @entity35 president the worry for all three @entity41 - endorsed rivals for @entity39 ’s crown — prince @entity127 , @entity129 ’s @entity128 and @entity130 ’s @entity82 — is that the @entity35 president still enjoys backing in @entity47			2
@entity133 football president @entity132 claims as many as half of @entity41 delegates could back @entity39			2
that seems unlikely but at least 15 out of 54 countries could			0
meanwhile , @entity128 was easily the most impressive of the three challengers when they were given the @entity43 floor			0
@entity30 chairman @entity120 ’s demand for radical changes in top - flight clubs ’ 25 - man squads to ensure young @entity145 players get more game time has irritated the @entity147			1
@entity120 said : ‘ we ’re open to discussions and i ’d like to persuade some of the clubs this is an issue			2
’ @entity30 chief @entity120 has angered @entity147 clubs with his plans for more home - grown players there could now be tension between @entity120 and the @entity147 at the clubs ’ summit on thursday , particularly given @entity120 was last week advised not to go public by the @entity160 representatives on the @entity161			1
but the extent to which @entity163 were determined to get maximum publicity for @entity120 ’s proposals was shown by them bringing in expensive pr firm @entity167 to lobby media to attend the press briefing			2
it was also held at the start of international week so the @entity147 could have no complaints about it deflecting attention from their competition .			0

opposition from home nations is set to scrap plans for @entity181 's @entity3 football team at the 2016 @entity24
@entity48 held back comments about @entity39 at @entity43
@entity1 face @entity91 in june hoping there will be no repeat of the 1995 riot
@entity120 has angered clubs with his proposals to reform 25 - man squads
