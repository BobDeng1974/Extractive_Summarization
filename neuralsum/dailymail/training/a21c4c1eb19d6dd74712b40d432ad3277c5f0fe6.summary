by @entity0 last updated at 12:26 pm on 18th november 2011 a brave cancer sufferer who filmed herself asking @entity4 star @entity3 out on a date has become an internet sensation			1
pretty brunette @entity7 , who suffers from pancreatic neuroendcrine cancer , decided to solve her dating crisis by asking the @entity11 star out for a coffee in a @entity14 video			1
despite saying she finds it hard to explain her cancerous tumour to potential dates , the 26 - year - old plucked up the courage to ask out long - term crush @entity3 in a video which has become an unlikely web hit			2
@entity7 decided to ask @entity3 for a date after watching his latest film ' 50/50 ' , in which @entity3 plays a 27 - year - old who is suddenly diagnosed with cancer			1
the story is based on the personal struggles with the disease by the movie 's writer @entity39			0
in the 38 - second video , she says : ' i think i identify with your character more than most people because i 'm 26 and i have cancer			1
empathy : @entity7 said she could identify with @entity3 in ' cancer comedy ' ' 50/50 ' , where he plays a man diagnosed with the disease ' even though i look healthy , dating has been a little difficult because i 'm not sure how to explain what i have been going through			1
' but after a year of living with this i have decided to get back on the dating scene , and i would like my first date to be with you			0
' maybe you can call it my ' make a wish ' , but let 's not be over dramatic			0
' just a cup of coffee with you would make me happy			0
' @entity7 was diagnosed with cancer last year , she had surgery in december 2010 to remove half of her pancreas and liver , her spleen and gallbladder and she is currently on an oral chemotherapy medication			2
@entity7 said of the video : ' after seeing @entity3 's performance and seeing and reading some of his subsequent interviews about the film i thought ' this guy gets it '			1
' and i thought ' he 's cute , i wonder if i could ever run into him somewhere '			0
but even though i live in @entity79 , it seemed impossible to find him			0
' best - known : the 30 - year - old actor is widely recognised for his role alongside @entity83 in inception star factor : another of @entity3 's big parts saw him in the leading role alongside @entity89 in ' @entity90 ' ' for most of the past year i have been selectively telling people about my diagnosis			2
' in august , i started this blog , so a few more people found out			0
this weekend , i ' came out ' as a cancer liver on @entity96 and i got tons ( sic ) of well wishes from old friends and acquaintances alike			2
' one thing i really miss about being healthy is that i always had the freedom to do what i wanted without really having to plan ahead			0
so i thought , ' why not ? '' despite the video being viewed over 257,000 times and @entity7 receiving widespread support on @entity107 , there was no indication as yet of a response from @entity3 .			1
