by @entity0 published : 11:07 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 16:47 est , 11 december 2013 a @entity2 presenter yesterday launched a live tirade against a secular seasonal display set to be erected next to a @entity6 display at a state capitol building			1
@entity10 governor @entity9 's office last week gave the green light to proposals to install a @entity14 pole made of @entity16 beer cans next to a nativity display			1
@entity14 is a well - celebrated parody alternative to @entity6 popularised by the @entity20 sitcom @entity21 and invented by the family of one of its scriptwriters			1
however , the joke was lost on @entity2 host @entity27 , who pronounced herself ' outraged ' during a broadcast alongside @entity50 president @entity49 yesterday			1
' why do i have to drive around with my kids to look for a nativity scenes and be , like , " oh , yeah , kids , look , there ’s baby @entity56 behind the @entity14 pole made out of beer cans ! " it ’s nuts ! mr @entity49 chimed in : ' we do n’t have to have the @entity61 out there on @entity62 with their monuments right next to a bust of @entity62			1
@entity14 pole : @entity14 is a well - celebrated parody alternative to @entity6 popularised by the @entity20 sitcom seinfeld that has become widely accepted ' we do n’t want to have neo-nazis out there to stick it to @entity70 on @entity71			1
and we should n’t have people out there ready to trash @entity74 given that proximity			0
' let them do it some other time and some other place			0
' but @entity80 , president of @entity81 , who was also part of the panel discussion , defended the idea of a public display of secularism so close to @entity6			2
' the season does n't belong to @entity74 , the season belongs to everyone , ' he said			0
' @entity74 stole the season from the @entity91			0
' he added : ' there is no wrong way to celebrate the season , it belongs to all of us			0
i say it ’s much better without religion			0
dump the church , you do n’t like it anyway			0
happy @entity14 ! for all of us ! ' the row over @entity14 marks a coming of age for the parody winter festival , which first entered popular culture after it was made the focus of a 1997 episode of @entity21			1
it had its genesis in the family of @entity113 , a writer for the long - running sitcom , whose father @entity115 , a @entity116 editor , invented it in 1966 to commemorate he and his wife 's first date			2
that was a date in february , however in the original @entity115 family tradition , the holiday would take place in response to family tension , ' any time from december to may			0
' after a rapid rise in popularity , these days @entity14 is celebrated on december 23 as a parody alternative to @entity6			2
in 2005 , @entity130 governor @entity129 was declared ' governor @entity14 ' and during the holiday season displayed a @entity132 in the family room of the @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity130 .			2

@entity10 governor *approved* plans for @entity14 pole outside state @entity140
