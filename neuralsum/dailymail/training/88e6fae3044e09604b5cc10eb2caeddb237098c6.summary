first it targeted our vacuum cleaners in the name of global warming – now the @entity5 is gunning for petrol - driven lawnmowers			1
they are among a range of outdoor equipment facing stringent emissions tests , including chainsaws , combine harvesters and river barges			1
the @entity14 has already forced vacuum cleaner manufacturers to stop producing the most powerful machines			2
as well as small gardening and handheld equipment , bigger off - road equipment including excavators , bulldozers and crop harvesters , as well as railcars , locomotives and inland waterway vessels such as river barges are also in the @entity26 executive ’s sights			1
‘ these people are fanatics , ’ said @entity46 , @entity47 mp for the north - west of @entity48			0
‘ they are so blind to their own failings that they do not even realise the contempt which their hyperactivity breeds in the voting public			0
they just need to stop , take a deep breath and take a look at themselves			0
’ industry was quick to point out that the law will backfire because manufacturers will simply withdraw from unprofitable market sectors rather than produce a new range of @entity5 - compliant engines			2
‘ this is a major problem for us , ’ said @entity65 , secretary general of the @entity66			0
‘ the engine manufacturers themselves have already warned the @entity14 that they will not follow the new standards			0
’ she added that the law will lead to unintended consequences , in particular the inability of barge owners to find replacement engines			0
consumers snapped up high - powered hoovers in the lead - up to the diktat outlawing machines of over 1,600 watts			1
above , the @entity14 's headquarter while big manufacturers – of cars , for example – are obliged to follow new @entity90 standards set in @entity26 , smaller manufacturers of niche products are just as likely to abandon @entity90 for more profitable markets as produce a new product range			2
the new legislation comes despite a pledge by @entity95 , president - designate of the @entity14 , to cut back on red tape by focusing the @entity26 bureaucracy ’s work on matters that are essential for the smooth running of @entity90 business			2
last month there was a stampede of panic - buying when a @entity26 diktat outlawed powerful vacuum cleaners over 1600 watts			1
a list of 30 high - wattage household devices could also be banned next spring following a draft @entity5 report which examined ways to reduce power consumption			1
these are thought to include powerful hairdryers and kettles .			0

@entity117 , combine harvesters and river barges are next on the @entity5 's agenda
@entity26 wants to cut emissions from ' non-road mobile machinery '
*earlier* this month high - powered vacuum cleaners were banned
@entity127 of *shoppers* bought the hoovers in the lead - up to the ban
