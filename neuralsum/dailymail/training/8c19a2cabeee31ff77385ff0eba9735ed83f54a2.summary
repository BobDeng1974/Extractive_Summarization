by @entity0 published : 12:52 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 02:45 est , 5 december 2012 the reverend @entity1 probably thought he was doing @entity3 's work by discussing men 's health issues on his blog			1
but his decision to show men how to examine their privates using a suggestive snap of a man wearing just his boxer shorts outraged parishioners at @entity13 , @entity14			1
the close - up photo , which mr @entity1 says is not of him and was obtained from the internet , appears to show the man touching the front of his underwear - clad crotch			1
it appeared on his ' a day in my life ' blog at end of last month aimed at raising awareness of testicular and prostate cancer			0
and it was promptly branded ' inappropriate ' by his churchgoers amid fears it could be easily accessed by children			2
@entity33 upset parishioners with his men 's health awareness blog reverend @entity1 says he obtained the snap from an internet search mr @entity1 says he uploaded the shot as part of the @entity43 campaign , which aims to raise awareness of serious health conditions men may be too embarrassed to talk about			1
but this cut no ice his churchgoers			0
one longstanding parishioner , who did not wish to be named said : ' we understand he ’s trying to get an important message across but we do n’t need to see a suggestive picture of a man touching himself			0
' children can access the blog - it is inappropriate for a church minister to put this on the internet			2
' however the bearded reverend was unrepentant about the posting , saying : ' i put the picture on the internet because testicular and prostate cancer are things that men in general do n’t speak about			1
' they wait until it is too late , by which time the available options are grossly reduced			0
' @entity33 said the blog was intended to tackle health issues ' men do n't speak about			1
' the bearded churchman said had blogged the photo after feeling ' left out ' of the traditional @entity43 campaign in which men grow moustaches for charity			2
and he added : “ it is one i cut and pasted off the internet			0
' i put the picture on the internet because testicular and prostate cancer are things that men in general do n’t speak about			2
' they wait until it is too late , by which time the available options are grossly reduced			0
' refuting claims that the photo was of him , he joked : ' the picture is definitely not me - there would have been a much larger tummy ! '			0
