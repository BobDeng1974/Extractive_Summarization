' @entity1 position ' : former @entity3 officer @entity2 , above , was relieved of his command of the @entity5 after junior officers complained of bullying a disgraced @entity3 captain is suing the @entity9 for more than £ 300,000 damages after a civil servant exposed his bullying in a newspaper			1
former commander @entity2 says his human rights were breached when a military press officer leaked the story of how his verbal abuse of junior officers led him to be relieved of the command of the warship @entity5			1
he is seeking the damages on the grounds that the @entity9 employed @entity22 – who was later charged with misconduct in public office for selling stories to the press – and that she obtained the details of his punishment from colleagues or office computers			1
last night , one leading media lawyer warned that the case could trigger a flood of copycat claims			0
mr @entity2 ’s legal team say the disciplinary action , which was taken after two junior naval officers accused him of intimidating them , should have remained secret , and that its exposure caused him ‘ loss , distress , anxiety , humiliation and damage to his reputation ’			1
‘ the claimant suffered the humiliation of having his reputation sullied in the national press			2
the articles were read by family and friends as well as potential employers , ’ they say in a @entity48 writ , which has been seen by @entity49			0
they also highlight the ‘ failure ’ of the @entity9 to ‘ acknowledge its wrongdoing or to apologise ’			0
the writ was drawn up by @entity60 , a human rights barrister who sits on the board of media regulation pressure group hacked @entity63			2
he has also represented celebrities seeking privacy injunctions			0
mr @entity2 – who ironically now delivers speeches about workplace bullying – is being represented by leading libel lawyers @entity69			1
the 49 - year - old was an officer in the @entity3 from 1986 until 2004 when he was abruptly removed from his command of the type 23 frigate @entity5 at @entity73 after a six - month tour of the @entity75			1
first , a male junior officer had used a 24 - hour helpline to complain that mr @entity2 ’s style of leadership amounted to bullying			1
a female crew member later came forward with similar claims			2
after a ‘ confidential internal equal opportunities investigation ’ , mr @entity2 was told his position in the ship was ‘ untenable ’			1
he was given a desk job and later received a ‘ censure ’ – a formal written warning to remain on his file for five years			0
mr @entity2 's lawyers say the disciplinary action should have remained secret , and that its exposure caused him ‘ loss , distress , anxiety , humiliation and damage to his reputation ’ ( @entity5 above ) meanwhile , ms @entity100 ‘ unlawfully and corruptly disclosed ’ details to @entity103 she was paid £ 5,000 for the information and the paper published two stories about mr @entity2 in december 2004			1
according to the writ , only a handful of senior naval figures knew about what had happened and all @entity9 employees ‘ had a duty to keep the information confidential ’			0
military press officer , @entity22 , leaked news of mr @entity2 's punishment to the @entity103 newspaper mr @entity2 ’s lawyers claim : ‘ in corruptly disclosing the claimant ’s [ mr @entity2 ’s ] information to @entity103 newspaper , ms @entity100 - @entity119 was acting in the course of her employment with the defendant [ the @entity9 ] and the defendant is vicariously liable for her wrongdoing			1
’ this is because she ‘ obtained the claimant ’s information from other employees or from the defendant ’s computers or filing systems ’			0
‘ the wrongful conduct was , in all the circumstances , so closely connected with acts which ms @entity119 was authorised to carry out that the wrongful conduct could fairly and properly be regarded as being in the ordinary course of her employment			0
’ mr @entity2 found out what had happened only last year when he was contacted by police investigating phone hacking and corrupt payments by newspapers			1
the high - profile trial of senior figures at @entity103 and @entity152 was told that @entity153 was paid more than £ 80,000 over five years for providing exclusive stories			0
so far , at least ten police officers , prison guards and press officers have been charged with selling stories to newspapers under @entity160 ’s @entity22			1
lawyers now believe that even notorious criminals who had confidential details of their lives behind bars leaked by corrupt prison guards could serve writs against the @entity168			2
media lawyer @entity169 said : ‘ this would seem to open a real can of worms			0
this case is the trigger for others in this situation to take action			0
even a criminal who has information leaked by a prison officer about them could say it is a breach of confidence			2
’ an @entity9 spokesman said : ‘ due to ongoing legal proceedings , it would be inappropriate for us to comment			0
’ mr @entity2 could not be reached for comment .			2
