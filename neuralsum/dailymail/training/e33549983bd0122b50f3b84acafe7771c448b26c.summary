’ in just one year , house prices have jumped by 10.9 per cent , the first time that annual house price inflation has been in double figures since 2010 and the highest rate since june 2007			1
but the @entity1 raised its fears about the growing gulf between what people earn and what they have to pay to buy a property			0
@entity6 , chief executive of @entity1 warned that the rise in house prices needed to be watched ' carefully ' the average worker with a full - time job earns around £ 27,000 , but the average house price has jumped to £ 183,577 , which is nearly seven times higher than their salary			1
@entity30 , chief economist at the @entity1 , @entity32 ’s biggest building society , warned of the ‘ wide margin ’ between the rate at which house prices are rising and people ’s pay rises			2
official figures , from the @entity38 , reveal the average pay rises is currently 1.7 per cent a year , compared to house price growth of 10.9 per cent a year			1
as a result , people ’s pay is barely moving but house prices are rising rapidly			2

yesterday @entity1 said one in four homes in @entity47 are now sold for £ 500,000 or more , compared to only 13 per cent in 2007			1

‘ the risk of a ‘ bubble ’ forming in the capital remains very real			0
a key part of controlling house price growth is to build more houses			1
‘ mr @entity6 also warned : ‘ prices are affected by the fact that not enough houses are being built to keep up with the number of households being formed , so demand is outstripping supply			2
’ to add to the pressure on homebuyers , the stamp duty bill is proving a growing burden			0
as house prices rises , the tax bill also grows			2
@entity93 , from the comparison website @entity95 , said stamp duty is ‘ another obstacle hampering homeownership			0
’ she added : ‘ the thresholds [ at which stamp duty is charged ] have been held at the same levels for years now			0
rising property prices mean that an increasing number of first - time buyers have to pay the three per cent rate			0
‘ this is n’t right and it is time for the government to reform this tax			0
’ the @entity110 said rising house prices are helping homeowners with an interest - only mortgage , which means they only pay the interest on the loan , but not the loan itself			2
around 2.2million people have an interest only mortgage , and it said only ‘ a relatively modest ’ number have no plan for repaying the loan when the time comes			0
over the last year , mortgage lenders have been contacting all homeowner with this type of loan , if it matures before the end of 2020 , to discuss what they are planning to do .			0
