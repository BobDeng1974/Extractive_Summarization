by @entity0 last updated at 7:28 pm on 27th january 2012 a student is counting the cost of cheap drinks promotions today after video of her dancing naked in an inflatable paddling pool at a nightclub went viral on the internet			1
the university student - who @entity9 has chosen not to identify - woke up this morning to find that a 10 - minute video of the incident at @entity13 nightclub in @entity14 had been circulated widely on @entity15			1
a student - who is not being identified by @entity9 - has been left embarrassed after a video of her stripping off in a nightclub went viral her behaviour is a classic example of @entity22 's binge - drinking culture - and the embarrassment it can cause			1
and the speed with which her drunken antics went viral highlights the power of social media			2
a one - minute version was available on @entity31 and attracted more than 1,000 hits in less than 10 minutes			1
it has now been removed			2
the 20 - year - old took part in a wet t - shirt contest as part of the @entity38 event - billed as ' @entity14 's naughtiest night ' - where vodka and other spirits cost just £ 1.75 for a double			1
at the event , which boasts the cheapest drinks in @entity14 , bottles of lager and alcopops were on sale at £ 1.20			1
while other girls thought it enough to remove their tops , the student stripped off entirely and frolicked in the inflatable paddling pool			1
with another reveller filming the ' contest ' on a mobile phone , she leans over the edge of the pool plays for the cameras			1
the @entity60 song @entity61 plays loudly in the background as men cheer and chant ' off , off , off			2
' as the student is exposing herself herself , the @entity65 uses his microphone to shout : ' get em ' off '			1
the shame - faced student , who had clearly been drinking , used her @entity15 account to send a message a day later which read : ' yes i got drunk and yes i got naked			1
' we all do things we regret and there is nothing i can do about it now ! ' the embarrassed student later tweeted that she had also lost her underwear , her earrings and had not been given £ 50 prize money for the wet t - shirt competition			1
she was too embarrassed to comment when contacted to comment			2
student @entity83 , 23 , said : ' there was a lot of cheering going on and i looked around to see a naked girl in the paddling pool			1
the student later posted this tweet of regret about the incident ' she seemed to be having a good time and everyone was reaching for their mobile phones to video her			1
' i think the club staff stepped in to cover her up but i ’ve seen one of the videos on twitter and it lasts for 10 minutes			1
' everyone had a lot to drink - i ’ll bet she ’s regretting it now			1
' a spokesman for the @entity13 club said : ' the night in question was a promoter event - this is where the event is put on and run by a third party			1
' @entity13 does not condone such behaviour			1
the embarrassing antics took place at @entity13 nightclub in @entity14 ' the @entity13 door team dealt with the incident at the time and the clubs management has had the appropriate conversation with the promoter regarding this			1
' the video of the student in the paddling pool has now been removed from @entity31			1
@entity128 , from alcohol education charity drinkaware , said : ' there 's nothing wrong with enjoying a few drinks on a night out			2
' but the digital world we live in means that people who have been drinking to excess can have their actions come back to haunt them online			2
' what might appear fun when drunk can feel foolish and embarrassing in the cold light of day			0
' @entity143 research shows that over a third [ 38 per cent ] of 18 - 24 year - olds admit to experiencing " cybershame " - regretting something they 've posted online when drinking on a night out			1
' and 47 per cent of those polled admit to un-tagging drunk photos of themselves they did n't want others to see			2
' thirty eight per cent also reported feeling embarrassed about seeing pictures of themselves online doing things they do n't remember after a night of excessive drinking			2
' he added : ' there are simple ways to prevent a night taking a turn for the worse and avoid seeing embarrassing posts and pictures splashed over the internet the next day			0
eating a meal before drinking or when out and making every third drink a soft one can make the difference between having a good night or a bad one			0
' the prime minister has demanded each unit of alcohol be sold for no less than 40p to 50p in @entity22 's supermarkets ( picture posed by models ) alcohol will be sold with a minimum price to deter binge drinking under plans ordered by @entity177			0
the prime minister has demanded each unit of alcohol be sold for no less than 40p to 50p in @entity22 ’s supermarkets			0
the proposals , which mr @entity177 wants included in an alcohol strategy paper to be published in february , will cost drinkers £ 700million a year			1
the prime minister has repeatedly said he wants a minimum price to help tackle @entity22 ’s obesity and binge drinking epidemic			0
government sources said he has overruled health secretary @entity187 , who favoured a voluntary system for retailers , and is insisting that the basement price be imposed by law			0
the scheme will mirror one introduced in @entity193 , where the sale of alcohol below 45p a unit is banned			0
it will be accompanied by a public health campaign on television to persuade people to moderate their alcohol intake			0
extra tax revenue raised from the plans will be ploughed back into the @entity204			0
but the strategy paper has been delayed as a result of arguments in government about how to impose the change , which critics will challenge as a nanny state measure			0
government lawyers have warned that an attempt to impose legal restrictions on alcohol costs could fall foul of @entity218 competition laws			0
home secretary @entity219 , whose department deals with much of the fallout from binge drinking on @entity22 ’s streets , wants to tax drink on the basis of alcoholic units			0
the @entity227 has warned that forcing firms to charge a minimum price could be illegal			0
there is also disagreement about whether the minimum price would just be imposed on cheap supermarket alcohol , or whether pubs would be targeted too			0
some ministers are concerned that would hit responsible drinkers too			0
beer and lager is currently taxed at 18p a unit , compared with 19p a unit for wine and about 25p a unit for standard spirits			0
@entity245 , charged at 20 per cent , is also added			0
a recent official study found that setting a minimum price of 30p per unit would prevent 300 deaths a year , 40p about 1,000 deaths , and 50p more than 2,000 premature deaths			2
in august 2010 , mr @entity177 said the cut - price drinks offers in supermarkets had turned town centres into the ‘ @entity255 ’			2
he said : ‘ there is a problem with very cheap alcohol , alcohol being bought at convenience stores and supermarkets that people are using to what ’s called " pre-load " before they go out			0
and this is a problem you just ca n’t ignore			0
‘ we ’ve got a situation where in some supermarkets you can walk in and buy incredibly cheap drinks , a lot of which is high strength lager , which people are using to get off their heads before they even go out			0
’ last year , the number of patients admitted to hospital for problems caused by drinking topped the one million mark for the first time .			0
