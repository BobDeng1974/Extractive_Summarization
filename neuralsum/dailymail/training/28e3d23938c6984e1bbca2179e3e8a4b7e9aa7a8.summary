by @entity0 published : 04:14 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 07:08 est , 24 may 2012 the @entity1 will receive a historic package tomorrow - a parcel delivered by the first private company to successfully launch a module in to space			1
@entity8 space capsule , launched on tuesday , signals the dawn of a new ' space race ' , but one founded on profit and competition rather than nationalistic pride			0
today the unmanned module will fly - by the @entity1 , passing by at a 1.5 miles , a tiny distance considering the distances involved			1
if @entity31 gives the green light , the @entity8 will then approach the @entity1 on friday			1
the planned docking will be the first time a private ship has docked with the @entity1 the crew onboard the @entity1 will then use the station 's robotic arm to capture the capsule as it drifts by , and then attach it to the orbiting research outpost			1
the hatch of the @entity8 will then open on saturday to give the @entity1 a gift - 521 kilograms of cargo for the space lab. on the last day of the month , @entity8 will then depart back for @entity44 , hopefully splashing safely down in the @entity45			1
the test flight of @entity21 's capsule , launched on the company 's @entity22 rocket , will hopefully help @entity50 re-establish access to the @entity1 , after @entity31 retired its space shuttle fleet last year			1
@entity31 spokesman @entity53 told @entity54 : ' so far everything is going as planned ' , and said there was a ' sense of optimism ' among the mission control team			0
he added the capsule has completed the first part of its demonstration flight , including navigating via @entity64 , testing its reaction to an ' abort ' demonstration , and a demonstration of ' free drift ' , a mode often used when interacting with the @entity1 the private space cargo firm 's historic launch to the @entity1 blasted off at 8.44bst on tuesday , carrying with it a capsule loaded with 1,000lbs of space station provisions			1
also on - board are the ashes of @entity77 legend @entity76 , fulfilling his final wish to spend eternity resting in space			0
up , up and away ! sparks fly as the rocket leaves the launch pad and heads to the horizons while in space today , @entity8 will go through a series of tests and will pass around one and a half miles below the station to see if its controls are testing properly			1
if that checks out ok , the @entity1 will allow the @entity27 to within 10 feet and pull it in for docking all the while traveling at 17,500 mph			2
staying on board the space station for a week and a half , it will then be re-loaded and sent back to @entity44 where it will land in the @entity45 and be retrieved			0
the mission is the first by a private company to the $ 100billion orbital outpost , a project of 15 countries			0
@entity31 is investing in @entity21 , as well as four other companies , to fly cargo and eventually astronauts to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles last summer			0
the first attempt on saturday stalled , as the countdown reached all the way to practically zero before there was an automatic shutdown by on - board computers			0
so instead of blasting off from @entity24 on a delivery mission to the @entity1 , the rocket remained on its launch pad amid a cloud of engine exhaust			2
the rocket is lost against the inky - black sky during the pre-dawn launch at @entity24 , but the flames light up the surroundings standing tall : @entity22 9 and @entity8 spacecraft , pictured a day before its first launch , are in the final stages of preparation for their historic flightute safely ( left ) and to splash down in the @entity45 ( right ) only governments have completed such a feat to date , with the @entity21 voyage the first time such a voyage has been completed by a private firm			0
ferrying the @entity27 into space , the mission to the @entity1 will be to deliver 1,000 pounds of non-essential cargo after passing a series of test maneuvers over the course of three days			2
if successful in its first - of - a kind mission , the company behind the venture @entity21 would collect the remaining payments on the $ 396 million contract it has with @entity31 and then enter into a $ 1.6 billion agreement for 11 more flights to the @entity1 the first step in the commercialisation of space to non-governmental firms , @entity21 is hoping one day to deliver up to seven passengers to the @entity1 and other destinations in low - @entity44 orbit .			2

module will pass the @entity1 from a distance of just 1.5 miles while tests are carried out
