a range of contact lenses has been developed that the makers claim can make the wearer look younger and more attractive			2
the @entity5 lenses have a pigment inside that helps to define the border around the iris , known as the limbal ring			1
this ring naturally fades with age and poor health , so improving the definition is said to make us look more youthful , and healthier			1
the new lenses ( pictured right ) claim to make eyes look younger by defining the edge of a person 's iris , a quality said to have an anti-aging effect product designer @entity28 said : ' the limbal ring is often known as " nature 's eye - liner "			1
' in fact , studies show faces with a more distinctive definition around the limbal ring are rated as more attractive			1
' since a limbal ring usually fades over time , a defined one can suggest youthfulness and good health			1
' a limbal ring is a dark circle that appears around the iris of your eye - the coloured part			1
the rings are typically less than a millimetre thick , and are associated with youthfulness - the rings are darker when a person is a child , and fade with age			0
some studies have also claimed that a more prominent limbal ring is a sign of attractiveness			2
the lenses can be used by people with dark or lighter eyes , she added			0
lenses for lighter eyes are described as giving a ' sparkle effect ' and those for darker eyes are described as giving a ' shimmer effect '			0
in 2011 , researchers from the @entity67 conducted a study in which participants were shown a set of 80 pairs of faces and asked to rate them for attractiveness			0
the faces in each pair were the same except one had been digitally altered to have a darkened limbal ring			2
looking good : the limbal ring ring naturally fades with age and poor health , so improving the definition is said to make us look more youthful , and healthier , a study has claimed ( before and after of lenses pictured ) age fades the colour in a person 's eye ( stock image of elderly man pictured ) , but if someone has high cholesterol there can be a white ring in the clear cornea and this deposit dulls the iris colour too the pattern on the @entity98 ( top ) gives it more depth and provides an intense effect whereas the pattern on the @entity103 ( bottom ) provides a luminous and brightening effect the researchers found that the male and female participants , who were not aware of what had been changed , overwhelmingly preferred the photos showing the darker limbal rings			1
the scientists , who published their research in the journal @entity115 , suggested that we have evolved to find faces with more defined limbal rings as more attractive because they signal that the person is young and healthy enough to reproduce with			0
dr @entity120 , a psychologist at @entity121 who specialises in attractiveness , said : ' the limbal ring fades over time , so it is used - unconsciously - as an indicator of age			1
' this is interesting because we perceive most other indicators of age - wrinkled skin , grey hair , voice , changes in posture - consciously			0
' but i 'm pretty sure most people have never given their limbal rings a second thought ! ' consultant ophthalmologist @entity137 said there is nothing we can do to prevent the natural fading of the limbal ring with the passage of time - but certain conditions can make it worse			2
' the iris pigment can fall out over the years , so the colour fades , ' he said			0
' but if someone has high cholesterol there can be a white ring in the clear cornea and this deposit dulls the iris colour too			0
