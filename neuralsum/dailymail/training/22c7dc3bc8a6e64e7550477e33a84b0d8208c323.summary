president @entity0 has preached economic opportunity and equal access to education as cornerstones of the legacy he says he wants to leave behind			2
but in the contest to host his presidential library , the @entity48 - based university that serves a needy community fears the playing field has been tilted against it by a pair of elite , private schools with seemingly endless funding this december 2013 photo shows one possible location in the @entity58 district of @entity59 to be considered for the @entity60			1
@entity62 sen. @entity61 said during a recent interview that his state ca n't compete financially with two others under consideration in @entity67 and @entity48 , but ' we bring different assets to the table ' as @entity0 weighs a decision he 'll announce within months , the @entity71 and the @entity17 are struggling to offer the upfront resources needed to offset the massive cost of building the library and presidential museum , expected to run close to half a billion dollars			1
the other two schools in the running , @entity79 , located in @entity67 , and the @entity80 , are both top - 10 schools with a combined endowment of more than $ 15 billion			1
the @entity82 are expected to raise much — but not all — of the money themselves , so a university 's ability to contribute will be a major factor			2
the @entity87 , which is screening proposals and will recommend a winner to @entity0 , has asked each school in the running for explicit details about what financial and other resources they can bring to bear			1
' look , when it comes to raw fundraising prowess , we 're not in a position to compete with @entity67 and @entity48 , ' @entity62 sen. @entity61 said during a recent interview in his @entity59 office , overlooking the panoramic , oceanfront site that @entity62 has proposed for the library			2
' we bring different assets to the table			0
but if the question is who can raise more money , @entity59 's going to come in third , ' he added			0
president @entity0 golfs with friends @entity110 , left , and @entity111 , right , on monday at the @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity62 during his family vacation in the state in which he was born and raised			2
@entity0 will decide whether or not to build his presidential library in @entity62 early in the @entity117 view of @entity79 campus in @entity67 , another school under consideration to house @entity0 's library			1
@entity79 is a top - 10 school with an endowment that ranges in the billions in an unusual move this week , the @entity0 foundation let it be known that it was displeased with @entity48 's proposals			1
the @entity80 , a private school near @entity0 's @entity130 home , has long been perceived as a front - runner due to its close ties to the @entity82			1
but the three sites the university has proposed are on @entity137 land , and the university ca n't prove it could secure the land if it was selected , the person said			0
still , the blunt warning through the media appeared designed mainly to light a fire under the university to fill holes in its proposal , and mayor @entity148 's office quickly stepped in to say the city was working to acquire the land for the library 's use			2
' the mayor is committed to bringing the library home to @entity48 , and we continue to work with the foundation to ensure all @entity48 bids remain competitive , ' said @entity157 , the mayor 's senior adviser			0
although the park district 's board president , @entity159 , is married to @entity0 's longtime friend and commerce secretary @entity163 , @entity159 has recused himself			2
other attempts to build on park land have drawn consternation from groups like @entity168			0
the group sued to block @entity171 creator @entity170 from building a museum on park acreage			0
one potential option could be for city to acquire the land from the park district if @entity48 is picked for the library			0
the city could return the property to the park system if another bid is selected			0
@entity157 said all options were being considered but that @entity148 will ' only consider potential sites that ensure park land remains under public control and that the surrounding communities have a say in the process			0
' @entity48 's other proposal , from the public @entity17 , was also met with scrutiny by @entity0 's foundation			1
the board of directors raised questions about how changes in leadership will affect the school 's future , the person said			0
the campus and @entity17 system are expected to have a new president , chancellor and board chairman within the next year			0
the person was n't authorized to comment publicly and demanded anonymity to the @entity206			0
the @entity17 said that @entity0 's foundation ' should feel confident in the university leadership 's ongoing support , ' adding that the incoming @entity210 governor will fill vacant trustee slots in january			1
the @entity80 declined to comment for @entity206 's report			2
the @entity80 , a private school near @entity0 's @entity130 home , has long been perceived as a front - runner due to its close ties to the @entity82			1
but the three sites the university has proposed are on @entity137 land , and the university ca n't prove it could secure the land if it was selected , a person familiar with the selection process said this week the @entity0 foundation said each school has its own unique strengths and regardless of which school is chosen , the foundation will be able to raise the needed money			1
' the foundation is looking at each response as a complete package and will choose a partner which , on balance , offers the best opportunity to create an outstanding presidential library and museum , ' the foundation said in a statement			0
as public , taxpayer - funded institutions , the @entity17 and the @entity71 face legal and practical limitations on how much they can contribute to a project such as @entity0 's library			1
nevertheless , both schools have sought to show they 're eager to do what they can			0
@entity62 lawmakers have expressed interest in having the state pitch in , while the foundation partnering with the @entity17 has pledged $ 5 million			2
@entity0 was born in @entity62 and started his family and political career in @entity210			0
he went to college in @entity67			0
@entity79 and the @entity80 have been coy about what they 're offering			1
but people familiar with those schools ' proposals , who were n't authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity , said both schools are prepared to absorb a substantial chunk of the cost themselves			0
they 're also working to secure attractive real estate where the library can be built			0
although the foundation has tapped @entity270 , a major @entity272 fundraiser and former @entity0 campaign official , to direct fundraising , the foundation 's board has said it wo n't start seriously raising money to build the library until much later			1
the @entity82 have pledged not to solicit donations until after they leave office , even though they will select a site early in 2015			0
meantime , the question of what message @entity0 wants his library to convey has grown more pronounced as the economic recovery continues to leave many behind			2
@entity285 , a spokesman for the @entity286 , said @entity0 has a rare opportunity to show that one 's background need not predetermine one 's ability to succeed			2
' if you think about what @entity293 would do , where he would put a project like this , i think the answer becomes very clear , ' @entity285 said			0
' it really boils down to the have and the have - nots			0
