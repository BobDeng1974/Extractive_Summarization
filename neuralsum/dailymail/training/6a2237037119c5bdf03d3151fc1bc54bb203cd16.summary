by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 11:27 est , 3 january 2014 it may be the middle of winter , but these images show that at least one garden in the @entity6 is bursting with life			0
while most flower patches across the nation lie bare , @entity8 on the @entity9 can boast of having 255 different species of flower in bloom			1
@entity16 flower count , which was completed by @entity8 ’s head gardener , @entity17 , curator @entity17 and garden students , is an annual island tradition that has been taking place for more than 150 years			2
winter wonderland : this year the count found that the garden was home to 255 different species of plant vibrant : even in january , tropical flowers bloom in the garden , which is just 30 miles from the @entity30 mainland counting up : garden student @entity31 ( left ) , head gardener @entity17 ( centre ) and curator @entity17 ( right ) tally up the plants professional garden curators and local people have been called upon to count the number of flowering species and keep track of the diverse plant - life			1
the spectacular display of greenery is made possible by the balmy climate of the island of @entity44 , just 30 miles from the @entity30 coast , and the sheltered design of the gardens themselves			0
built alongside the stately @entity49 , once the home of a 19th century landowner , the gardens are protected by high walls and rows of thick trees and shrubs , which protect the delicate species inside from any rough winds			0
the gardens are also south - facing , which , combined the @entity9 ’ unusually high , means that plants from as far afield as @entity59 do not struggle to grow			1
colourful : mr @entity17 shows off the blooms of the exotic @entity63 plant @entity64 : mr @entity17 examines aeoniums and aloes in flower far - flung : mr @entity31 and mr @entity17 admire an @entity69 tree , from @entity70 @entity71 , drier terraces at the top of the garden suit @entity59 and @entity76 plants , while those lower down provide the humidity that favours flora from @entity79 and @entity80			1
when the winter blooms come , the garden ’s exotic aloes , acacias and proteas take centre stage			0
although the gardens have been decimated in previous years by extremely bad weather – such as the @entity90 – they are growing once again and this year 25 more species have been found than in the 2013 count .			2

@entity8 on the @entity9 has 255 species in bloom even in january
it is an annual tradition to tot up the species - which grew by 25 this year
the garden is an ideal growing spot thanks to its sheltered location
colourful plants from as far afield as @entity80 and @entity70 grow there
