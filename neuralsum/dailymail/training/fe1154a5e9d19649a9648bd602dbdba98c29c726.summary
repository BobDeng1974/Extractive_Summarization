sir @entity2 's @entity1 report has called for tighter laws surrounding cosmetic surgery including the introduction of insurance the @entity7 is to start offering insurance to patients who undergo plastic surgery with accredited surgeons			1
until now , no insurance policy for cosmetic surgery and the associated complications existed in the @entity14			1
the move comes after a @entity1 enquiry into cosmetic surgery were published last month			1
medical director sir @entity2 called for new laws to overhaul the £ 2.3billion sector			1
two of the key demands cited in the report was for insurance to be provided by clinics and information for patients about the success rates of their surgeons			0
@entity8 represents the vast majority of @entity30 practitioners and is the only plastic surgery society to conduct a yearly audit of the procedures performed by its members			0
it worked with specialist insurers @entity36 to create a policy that would safeguard all patients of surgeons who are part of the association			0
because all @entity8 surgeons are covered by the insurance , patients do not need to take the insurance out themselves			2
the price of cover will be included in their quote for the surgery			0
the new ‘ @entity60 ’ or ‘ @entity62 ’ policy covers corrective treatment of all the most common complications of surgery , such as infection or bleeding , but also – a world first – capsular contracture , an abnormal reaction of the body to breast implants			1
up to one in ten women who undergo breast enhancement may develop this condition , but historically would have had to pay for corrective surgery themselves			2
sir @entity2 's @entity1 report has called for tighter laws surrounding cosmetic surgery including the introduction of insurance @entity8 president @entity72 said : ‘ in line with sir @entity2 ’s recommendations for more safeguards in the aesthetic surgery sector , we are [ launching ] a truly innovative insurance package that will further protect our patients			1
‘ no procedure is risk - free and @entity62 covers all common complications , so people undergoing surgery with @entity8 members can enjoy peace of mind that they will be looked after , in the unlikely event of any problems			2
’ the most popular surgical procedures are included in the policy including tummy tucks , eyelid surgery , arm lifts , breast augmentation , ‘ moob ’ reduction ( gynaecomastia ) , liposuction , facelifts , pinning back ears and fat grafting			0
common complications such as infection , haematoma ( bleeding ) , seroma ( build - up of fluid ) , nerve injury and others are also covered			0
many conditions can develop a month or longer after the procedure is undertaken – and in the case of capsular contracture , it could be several months - so the policy automatically activates on the twenty - ninth day after the op and remains live for two years , as during that initial period hospitals would cover any complications .			0
