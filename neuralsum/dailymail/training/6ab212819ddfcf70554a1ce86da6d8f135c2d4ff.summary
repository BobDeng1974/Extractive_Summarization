@entity1 ’s first spacewalk since april is currently underway , and can be watched live online			1
@entity3 astronaut @entity2 and @entity5 @entity4 are working together to move a broken pump , that has been been outside the station since december , into its proper storage location			1
the spacewalk is scheduled to last until about 7.40pm bst ( 2.40pm est ) today			0
watch a live stream of the spacewalk below			0
if the stream is n't being displayed correctly you can watch it live at @entity1 's website @entity3 - based spacewalks were curtailed in july 2013 after @entity17 astronaut @entity16 nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet			1
@entity1 solved the problem with the suit 's water - cooling system , but then concern arose over the spacesuit batteries			1
new batteries arrived late last month , clearing the way for today 's spacewalk , and another one scheduled for next week			1
the 780lb ( 350kg ) pump on the move is about the size of a double - door refrigerator			0
construction of the @entity33 began on 20 november 1998			0
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 264 miles ( 425 kilometres )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000 kilograms ) and has liveable space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity47 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600 kilometres ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,800 days , during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of @entity47 , and has been continuously occupied for over 13 years			0
it ended up in temporary storage during urgent spacewalking repairs to the station 's ammonia - cooling system last december			2
@entity1 did not want to waste time back then putting the pump in the correct long - term location , given all the spacesuit worries			1
this was the first spacewalk ever for mr @entity2 and mr @entity4 , and the former ’s exuberance was evident as he emerged from the hatch into the vast darkness over the @entity64			1
‘ wow , looks like we 've almost got a full moon out here			0
it 's beautiful , ’ he said			0
when the glow of sunrise started to appear several minutes later , he shared his excitement again with @entity71			0
a follow - up spacewalk is scheduled for 15 october to further whittle down @entity1 ’s lengthy to - do list , on hold since the 2013 incident			2
that spacewalk will be conducted by mr @entity2 and fellow @entity3 @entity77 , a newcomer			1
a week after that , two of the three @entity80 on board will perform a spacewalk on their country 's side of the orbiting outpost			0
the @entity88 - led spacewalks were unaffected by @entity1 's spacesuit troubles			1
engineers at @entity1 's mission control centre in @entity92 are talking two astronauts through a long overdue spacewalk on the @entity95 and @entity5 @entity4 are moving a refrigerator - sized pump ( pictured ) left outside the station in december the pump could not be moved until now owing to spacesuit troubles			1
in july last year , @entity17 astronaut @entity16 almost drowned when his helmet filled with water following a coolant fault			1
and later a battery malfunction left astronauts unable to go out the station			1
pictured is a still image from the current spacewalk in july 2013 , @entity1 was forced to dramatically abandon a spacewalk on the @entity33 after a dangerous water leak in an astronaut 's helmet drenched his eyes , nose and mouth			1
@entity17 's first spacewalker , @entity16 , endured the terrifying experience when his drink bag tipped half a liter of floating liquid around his face			1
@entity16 could not speak or hear his radio due to the water , and he got wedged outside the craft before being helped in by fellow astronauts			2
the leak was so bad that @entity16 asked his spacewalking partner , @entity3 @entity128 , to help him back in			2
' it 's a lot of water , ' the @entity17 said once he was back in the air lock of the station			2
he later recalled that he thought he was going to drown during the ordeal			0
the helmets used by mr @entity2 and mr @entity4 for today 's spacewalk contained absorbent pads and makeshift snorkels in case of water leakage			1
as for the spacesuit batteries , @entity1 sent up replacements on the latest @entity143 cargo ship and @entity80 soyuz capsule			2
ground testing uncovered a potential fuse problem earlier this year , and @entity1 opted to switch out the batteries on board			2
in the movie @entity149 , which stars @entity150 and @entity151 , the astronauts fight for survival after a cloud of debris wrecks their @entity156 and subsequently destroys the @entity33 ( shown )			0
the latest spacewalk might not be this dramatic but the feat of engineering involved is impressive nonetheless this was the first spacewalk ever for mr @entity2 and mr @entity4 ( pictured ) , and the former ’s exuberance was evident as he emerged from the hatch into the vast darkness over the @entity64			1

@entity1 's mission control is talking astronauts through an @entity33 spacewalk
@entity3 @entity2 and @entity5 @entity4 are moving a refrigerator - sized pump that was left outside the station in december
but it could not be moved until now owing to spacesuit troubles
in july last year , @entity17 astronaut @entity16 almost drowned when his helmet filled with water following a coolant fault
and later a battery malfunction left astronauts unable to go out the station
but new batteries arrived last week so @entity3 spacewalks could begin again
the latest spacewalk is live now and finishes around 7.40 bst ( 2.40 est )
