by @entity1 reporter published : 23:45 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 23:45 est , 31 july 2013 @entity2 is bringing a pared - down version of its office software to @entity6 phones			1
but do n’t expect a version for your tablet , unless you use @entity10 — the software giant wo n’t be releasing it for the @entity12 and @entity6 tablet users out there the company made the software available wednesday through @entity18 's online play store			1
it requires a $ 100 - a - year subscription to @entity21 and wo n't be sold separately			0
new platform : @entity2 now offers its @entity24 app for users of @entity6 phones the new offering follows the release of an @entity29 version in june and brings an office app to phones running the most widely used operating system on new smartphones			1
like the other mobile versions , the new @entity6 software is designed for lightweight use			0
for example , you can use it to view and edit an attachment sent by email			0
but it 's not meant to create a complex spreadsheet from scratch			0
@entity2 is trying to make its @entity46 subscription more compelling , without removing an advantage that tablet computers running @entity2 's @entity50 system have — the ability to run popular office programs such as @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
' the release of this app shows that we 're committed to keep providing additional value for @entity46 subscribers , ' the company wrote in a blog post			0
' @entity46 subscribers will now be able to access , view , and edit @entity53 , @entity54 and powerpoint documents with @entity66 , @entity29 and @entity6 phones			1
' just phones : @entity2 ceo @entity69 speaks at a @entity2 event in @entity71 , monday july 16			2
though the @entity21 app is now available on @entity6 phones , @entity12 users and @entity6 tablat users still ca n't use the program @entity2 is pushing subscriptions as a way to get customers to keep paying for a product that was historically sold in a single purchase			1
the company touts such benefits as the ability to run the package on multiple computers and get updates for free on a regular basis			0
however , a subscription can be more expensive than buying the package outright for just one or two computers			0
@entity2 said it designed @entity24 for @entity6 phones specifically for the phone 's smaller screen , even though many people will prefer editing documents on a tablet 's larger screen			1
the company has a version for @entity12 and @entity6 tablets , called @entity102 , but that runs on a web browser and requires a constant online connection			2
the new @entity6 software is an app that gets installed on the phone and can work offline			2
with a subscription , customers typically get to use @entity21 on up to 10 devices			0
five of them can be @entity50 or @entity115 computers or @entity50 tablets			0
the other five can be iphones or @entity6 phones			1
@entity50 phones come with @entity21 installed and do not count toward the limit			0
in failing to make a version for the @entity12 , the top - selling tablet computer , @entity123 analyst @entity122 has estimated that @entity2 is potentially ceding $ 1.4 billion a year in revenue , based on 10 percent of the 140 million @entity12 owners paying for a $ 100 subscription			2
@entity122 said failure to provide it on the @entity12 or @entity6 tablets gives incentives for users to explore competing offerings such as @entity133 from @entity18 and @entity134 from @entity135			1
technically , @entity12 users can download the @entity29 version , but it does n't take advantage of the larger screen , so images and text are fuzzy when blown up			2
@entity6 tablet owners wo n't be able to download it at all through the play store			1
the new software requires @entity6 4.0 or later — the @entity146 or @entity147 flavors of @entity18 's operating system			1
at first , it 's available only in the @entity150 , though @entity2 plans to expand to 117 markets with versions in more than 30 languages			0
@entity2 did not announce any plans for @entity156 phones .			0

@entity18 's play store now offers @entity2 office for @entity6 phones
@entity12 and @entity6 tablet users still ca n't get the app
