ms @entity6 contacted the police after confronting the man in the pub who confessed to smashing her car and told them he was drunk			1
but she was left gobsmacked when officers told her they could not attend because no one had been hurt , leaving the man free to get back in his car and drive off			1
she said : ' the police say they are trying to cut down drink driving but then they just let one get away			2
they should ’ve come out he was so dangerous in that condition being behind the wheel			0
' he could barely speak he was so drunk and just reeked of alcohol			2
he tried to park on one side of me and crashed into my car , tried to park on the other side and crashed into my car again and then crashed into some wheelie bins			2
it was just lucky that car park was n’t filled with all the kids at the time			2

' @entity92 , if proven by a proper investigation , is a crime			0
' my understanding is that @entity78 is actively following up on the information provided to them about this particular incident			0

' ' i entirely understand the concern and frustration of the person who reported this serious incident , and i will be asking the chief constable for more details about this matter			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity78 said : ' the incidents relating to a road traffic collision and suspected drunk driver were recorded , the appropriate circulations to units across the district and reporting advice provided			1

' the road collision enquiries will be progressed in accordance with @entity78 procedures and a review of the service provided has been undertaken to ensure improved future performance			1
' @entity78 carried out its summer drink - drive campaign throughout last month			0
