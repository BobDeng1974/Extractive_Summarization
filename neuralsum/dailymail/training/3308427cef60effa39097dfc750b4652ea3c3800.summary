family birthdays at my @entity3 in - laws ' rambling farmhouse are mandatory but lively affairs , with anything from 20 to 25 noisy personalities gathered under one roof			1
every time i travel to a celebration with my husband to meet his sisters and brother , and their respective families , it is with some apprehension			2
from the off , i found these reunions terrifying			0
but as time passed , and @entity21 and i clocked up five years of marriage , i hoped my place as the second wife of my in - laws ' eldest child was finally , firmly , established			1
second best ? @entity27 fears she ca n't live up to @entity21 's first wife @entity28 so i was astonished by events at a recent birthday lunch			1
we were sitting round the table when my father - in - law poured himself another generous glass of @entity35 then asked : ' can you pass the cheese , @entity28 ? ' the uncomfortable silence was palpable			1
everyone knows ' @entity28 ' is not my name			1
it is the name of @entity21 's first wife			1
an embarrassed titter erupted from a guest and my sister - in - law , @entity45 , gave my hand a reassuring squeeze under the table			2
@entity21 swiftly came to the rescue			1
he broke the pregnant silence by asking if anyone wanted more wine			0
i have known @entity21 and his family for more than six years			1
it pains me to admit it , but such blunders - and they have happened more than once - still leave me feeling bewildered and distressed			2
perhaps i should be more generous to @entity21 's father , who is in his early 70s and can be forgetful			1
but i 'm at his house regularly : i help him with @entity61 , bring gifts and take him out to lunch , so the very least he can do , surely , is remember my name			0
mine is not the name which passes my in - laws ' lips the most , it is @entity28 's			1
at that birthday lunch , she was again , the spectre at the table , worming her way into a family gathering at which she had no place			0
@entity78 ’s novel @entity79 - in which the unnamed heroine lives her life in the shadow of her husband 's eponymous first bride - celebrates its 75th anniversary this year			1
it is a book i love but which has always haunted me			0
and today , the echo of the oh - so perfect first wife has shifted from powerful fiction to troubling fact			1
today i am in the shadow of my very own @entity79 : i live , day - in , day - out , with my husband 's ex. baby quest : @entity27 longs to give her husband children like his first wife did @entity78 's son @entity100 has revealed the novel was based on his mother 's jealousy of her husband 's first wife			1
she , like me , recognised that the ghost of the first wife can never be exorcised			0
when i first came across pictures of @entity21 and @entity28 together , my heart plummeted			1
flicking through album after photo album , i began to compare her relationship with @entity21 to mine			1
they were married for eight years			0
how could i possibly compete , i wondered			0
as i flicked through , they went from loved - up boyfriend and girlfriend to happily married couple , before becoming the proud parents of a daughter , and then a son - @entity121 , 29 , and @entity123 , 26			0
to my envious eyes , they seemed the perfect family			0
perhaps the biggest blow to my ego was that it was obvious they were each other 's first love			0
i have never dared delve too far into the reasons why she and @entity21 split , but they got together when young , and it seems , simply grew apart			2
' while i 'm in no doubt i am the love of his life , he is reluctant to take his family to task over @entity28 , and her seemingly privileged status ' it would make my life infinitely more bearable if @entity28 was fat , frumpy and past her prime , but she is n't			2
even though she is 15 years older than me , @entity28 - who is also @entity149 - is blonde , beautiful and intelligent			1
it is even more galling that she was a professional sportswoman , excelling at badminton , and is now a professor of @entity153			0
the perfect @entity28 has imposed herself with frustrating regularity - even on my wedding day			1
my stepdaughter mentioned her mother had wanted to send a card			0
@entity121 explained , awkwardly , that @entity28 had wanted to write ' @entity160 ' inside - as she thought i would need it			1
why would this woman feel the need to poke her nose in , 20 years after @entity21 had left her ? she has also guarded her friendship with my husband 's sister , @entity166 , staying in such close contact with her that i could never hope to form my own bond			1
what does @entity21 have to say about it ? very little			2
while i 'm in no doubt i am the love of his life , he is reluctant to take his family to task over @entity28 , and her seemingly privileged status			2
how does this make me feel ? disappointed and , on occasion , very nearly murderous			0
art imitating life : @entity78 's son said her novel @entity79 was based on her jealousy of her husband 's first wife in 2009 , without our say - so , she joined us with @entity21 's family on a weekend break			1
my in - laws take a summer holiday together every year , and it 's a tradition for the children to meet up with them for a long weekend			1
imagine my horror when , two years into my marriage , @entity21 and i arrived to discover his first wife was there too			1
at first , i had no idea who she was			0
my legs almost buckled when she bounded over , introduced herself and kissed @entity21 on the cheek			2
needless to say , it 's a day i would rather forget			0
not only did @entity28 insist on taking constant photographs of @entity21 and i , she also dominated the conversation at the dining table			1
she sat next to me - speaking perfect @entity3 , which at the time i could n't do - but interrogated me in @entity153 , goading me about why i 'd given up being a vegetarian			0
' i look to the future , to weddings , christenings and grandchildren , and shrink with misery when i think how @entity28 will dominate them ' a heavy silence hung between @entity21 and myself on the journey home , and it took until the next day for me to pluck up the courage to ask if he had known beforehand @entity28 would be there			1
he said he 'd known nothing about it , and we later found my in - laws did not tell us , because they knew we would not have gone			1
so the next year , i told @entity21 that if ' she ' was going on the family holiday , i was n't			2
for once , he took a stand and told his parents we would not be going and why			0
the fall - out was ugly			0
there were many heated telephone discussions between @entity21 and his parents , and since then the family holiday has been dropped			2
but it 's not @entity28 ’s looks , her @entity3 or even her equanimity with my in - laws which really irritates me			1
@entity28 has something i will never have			2
she gave birth to , and raised his children			0
and it 's becoming increasingly clear to me , midway through yet more ivf , that i will never achieve the same			0
@entity21 and i have been trying , unsuccessfully , to have a family of our own for the past five years			2
my stepchildren , though lovely , are the product of their marriage			0
they mean my husband 's life will forever be entwined with his ex-wife 's			1
no escape : @entity27 hates the fact @entity28 will always be in her life as the mother of @entity21 's children i look to the future , to weddings , christenings and grandchildren , and shrink with misery when i think how @entity28 will dominate them			1
sadly , i have no alternative but to avoid them			0
today , i am constantly reminded of @entity28 's status as ' mother ' and ' first wife ' whenever my stepchildren come to stay			1
she sends cards and presents which the children must hand over to their grandparents in front of me			0
these days , @entity121 rarely discusses her mother in front of me			0
i have left the table more than once when this conversation comes up			0
while @entity21 sympathises , he tries to keep the peace			2
i sometimes ask how he would feel if my parents discussed my ex-husband in his company			0
@entity21 's response is logical , but cuts me to the quick			1
' why would they talk about your ex ? ' he asks			0
' you do n't have children so there 's no reason for him to continue to play any part in your life			2
and so , my @entity292 battle continues , while the fragrant , fecund @entity28 wafts around my family			2
@entity166 , pointedly asks how things are going on ' that front ' whenever we meet			0
i do not doubt my answers are always faithfully reported back to @entity28			2
i ca n't help but feel @entity166 disapproves			0
when she gave my husband a ' friendly ' warning of how difficult the @entity292 process is , i had to wonder whether these were @entity166 's true feelings , or whether she was parroting something @entity28 had said to her			1
slowly , i have come to realise that the spectre of my husband 's oh - so perfect first wife will not go away			1
i may resent and regret that fact , but i know she will be in my marriage for the rest of my life			0
i only hope we can survive her presence			0
@entity314 's book , ' @entity312 ' , is out now .			0

@entity27 feels in the shadow of her husband 's first wife , @entity28
she resents how much her in - laws still talk to , and about , her
she had two children with @entity21
while @entity27 is struggling to conceive
