@entity0 has lifted a block on social media sites in the country after @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 agreed to remove chilling images of a prosecutor being held at gunpoint by left wing extremists			1
a @entity0 court imposed the blocks yesterday because photographs of the deadly siege in which @entity15 was killed were being widely shared on social media			1
the 46 - year - old @entity0 prosecutor died in hospital when two members of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage - uploading the photographs of @entity15 with a gun pointed at his head to social media in the process			1
@entity0 initially demanded domestic newspapers stop running the ' terrorist propaganda ' images , before going on to block access to @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 yesterday when requests to remove the photographs were ignored			1
access to @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 was re-established after the social media sites agreed to remove photographs of the deadly siege , which @entity0 has branded ' anti-government propaganda '			1
however @entity0 has since threatened to block access to @entity49 unless images of the siege are removed from its search function			2
the journalists group , @entity53 , said that while it understood the authorities concerns over the publication of the prosecutors ' photographs , it said banning social media websites was in conflict with democracy			1
' it is meaningless to totally shut down social platforms - which contain billions of useful information - to the use of the @entity0 people because of some unsuitable content , ' the group said			2
users meanwhile were sharing information on how to get around the ban on the @entity71			0
@entity15 and both of his captors were killed when @entity0 security forces took back the building where the far - left group was holding him			2
gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six - hour stand - off			0
grief : the family of @entity15 grieve over his coffin during his funeral at @entity85 in @entity35 , @entity0			2
he died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far - left organisation gathering : prosecutors , lawyers and judges stand near a statue of lady justice during the funeral ceremony before imposing the blocks on the websites , @entity0 authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week			1
the newspapers were accused by the government of ' spreading terrorist propaganda ' in sharing the images of the hostage - taking			2
a @entity106 national , of @entity108 origin but who has not been named , was arrested on saturday as part of an operation against the @entity20 , according to reports			0
a @entity114 spokeswoman said this morning : ' i can confirm that a @entity106 national has been arrested in @entity0 and that we are offering consular assistance			0
' presidential spokesman @entity119 said : ' this has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor 's picture			0
what happened in the aftermath [ of the prosecutor 's killing ] is as grim as the incident itself			0
' the demand from the prosecutor 's office is that this image not be used anywhere in electronic platforms ... the wife and children of prosecutor @entity15 have been deeply upset			0
' after the block was lifted journalism group @entity53 said that while it understands the authorities concerns over the publication of the prosecutors ' photographs , banning social media sites is in conflict with democracy			1
' it is meaningless to totally shut down social platforms - which contain billions of useful information -- to the use of the @entity0 people because of some unsuitable content , ' the group said			0
critical : prosecutor @entity15 was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries strength of feeling : @entity162 has since become an icon for the @entity0 far - left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death mr @entity15 , a father - of - two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse , was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of @entity174			0
the 15 - year - old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear - gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in @entity35 in june 2013			2
after spending 269 days in a coma , @entity162 eventually died on march 11 last year			0
his death , and the subsequent investigation , have since become a rallying point for the country 's far - left			0
last year , @entity0 blocked access to @entity6 and @entity4 after audio recordings of a secret security meeting or tapes suggesting corruption by government officials were leaked on the social media sites			1
@entity0 's highest court , however , overturned the bans , deeming them to be unconstitutional			0
previous moves by @entity0 authorities to block the social media networks have provoked widespread criticism by @entity199 governments and human rights organizations			1
many tech - savvy users , including former president @entity202 , had found ways to circumvent the bans both on @entity4 and @entity6 while they were in place .			1

*militants* stormed an @entity35 courthouse last week , taking him hostage
both he and his captors were killed during the subsequent rescue effort
