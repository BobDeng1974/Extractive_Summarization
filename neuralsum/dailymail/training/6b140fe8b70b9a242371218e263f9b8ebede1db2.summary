many @entity1 stars , and @entity2 , are discussing how upset they are with @entity4 's decision to not distribute their new film @entity6 following threats from hackers who have been releasing internal information and emails over the past two weeks			1
@entity12 pulled the planned @entity14 release of the picture after the hackers threatened 9/11 - like terror attacks on cinemas showing the comedy			2
and now , many are making it public how upset they are with @entity4			1
with the @entity4 collapse @entity36 has lost its first cyberwar			1
this is a very very dangerous precedent , ' wrote @entity27 on @entity40			1
he then said , ' @entity4 should release " the interview " online for free so @entity44 ca n't censor @entity36 creativity -- should have @entity44 language version			1
' many in @entity1 are also not happy with the decision to cancel the film , and also took to @entity40 to express their frustration and anger			1
an utter and complete victory for them			0
wow , ' wrote @entity56			2
he later added ; ' @entity57 at @entity58			0
both of us have never seen or heard of anything like this			0
@entity1 has done @entity63 proud today			0
@entity27 actually responded to @entity56 , saying , ' it was n't the hackers who won , it was the terrorists and almost certainly the @entity44 dictatorship , this was an act of war			0
' lending support : @entity56 ( above ) tweeted about how upset he was that the fil ; m would not be released after seeing star @entity73 at the airport @entity75 also weighed in , writing ; ' canceling " @entity6 " seems like a pretty horrible precedent to set			0
' @entity77 , who was the subject of many of the emails released in the hack , also spoke about @entity4 's decision			1
' today the @entity36 succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished , bedrock principle of free speech by a group of @entity44 terrorists who threatened to kill moviegoers in order to stop the release of a movie , ' he said in a statement			1
' the wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily distracted members of the @entity36 press who chose gossip and schadenfreude - fueled reporting over a story with immeasurable consequences for the public – a story that was developing right in front of their eyes			1
my deepest sympathies go out to @entity12 , @entity73 , @entity108 and everyone who worked on @entity6			0
' heavy hitters : big name writer @entity77 * ( left ) and director @entity111 ( right ) both released long statements about how upset this incident made them @entity117 and sweet : ' no bulls * * * though , this is seriously f * * * ed and it 's such a sad day for free speech , ' said @entity119 ( above ) of @entity4 's decision @entity73 , spotted at @entity121 on wednesday with a bodyguard after threats of a september 11 - style attack on movie theaters that showed the ' the interview ' in an interview with the @entity129 , director @entity111 voiced his concern about where the film industry goes from here			1
' what do they do when someone says the same thing about the @entity137 movie or @entity138 ? ' he asked			1
' there may be credible evidence of imminent violence that i do n’t know about			0
but if they do n’t really have that information , how many movies are they willing not to release ? ' our community is based on freedom of expression			2
are we going to suppress ourselves every time someone posts something online ? it ’s a dark future			0
' @entity152 kept it brief , saying on @entity40 , ' sad day for creative expression			2
' @entity155 also suffered a loss today as a film he was working on about @entity44 , @entity159 , will no longer be made			0
@entity119 also kept it brief , and vulgar , writing ; ' no bulls * it though , this is seriously fuc * ed and it 's such a sad day for free speech			2
' @entity164 compared the entire thing to censorship ; ' @entity4 's decision to pull the interview is unsettling in so many ways			1
good thing they did n't publish the @entity172			2
' the film may now never be released at all			0
' @entity12 has no further release plans for the film , ' said a spokesperson for the studio wednesday evening			0
this despite the fact that the film cost $ 42million to make and tens of millions to market			0
almost immediately , many in @entity1 voiced their concern , with writer @entity77 saying how upset he was that ' the @entity36 succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished , bedrock principle of free speech by a group of @entity44 terrorists , ' and director @entity111 explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward			1
federal government officials have said that @entity44 is behind the hack , as has been assumed for the past two weeks , though they are not expected to formally announce this until later this week			0
