by @entity0 published : 06:08 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 06:19 est , 30 august 2013 this week , @entity1 was pictured showing off his toned abs and impressive pecs as he did back - flips off a yacht			2
but this time last year , his physique was n't quite so svelte			2
the made in @entity8 star had piled on the pounds after indulging in a hard - partying lifestyle			1
now the reality show regular has revealed his muscly new look is the result of a week spent dragging logs and lifting tyres at a boot camp in @entity17 run by former soldiers			1
@entity1 , 25 , was determined not to have a repeat of his return to the show last year when he arrived on set looking decidedly podgy			2
@entity36 to start off on the right foot , he opted for gruelling 12 - hour a day work out sessions with @entity42 army @entity40 at the no 1 @entity43 in @entity17			0
to keep hunger pangs at bay , the star also admitted to using fat burning supplements made from appetite suppressing green coffee beans			1
@entity1 said ; ' the @entity51 really helped when the rations at the camp were meagre			0
it basically took my mind off wanting to go and have a snack and stopped me from going crazy for food			0
' gritty : @entity1 looks hot and bothered as he takes part in a training session at the @entity17 boot camp and heave ! @entity1 looks pained as he lifts a very heavy looking log during one of the boot camp workouts and his dedication certainly seems to have paid off , as he managed to drop a stone and now tips the scales at a slimline 13st			1
@entity1 said : ' it ’s been a very hard slog getting in shape but no 1 boot camp do n’t let you quit			1
they had me doing 50 burpees every time i did a fitness session - burpees are a nightmare			0
' it ’s a squat thrust followed by a star jump			0
i would suggest very strongly that you do n’t try to do 50 in a row			0
' this is the second time that @entity1 has visited the boot camp			1
he previously went to the @entity90 camp and lost 13lbs but his party lifestyle saw him put most of the weight back on			1
this time however , he hopes to maintain his healthy 13st frame - preferably without any more visits to the boys in green			0
who said getting fit was easy ? @entity1 lifts a pair of small weights during a work out tough : @entity1 lifts a pair of tyres during a workout devised by ex-army personal trainers			0
