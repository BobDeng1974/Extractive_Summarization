by @entity0 how do the spindly legs of a giraffe support its huge weight ? it 's something that has puzzled scientists , but they may now have uncovered the answer			1
researchers at the @entity8 in @entity9 have identified a highly specialised ligament structure that is thought to prevent giraffes ' legs from collapsing under the immense weight of the animal			1
researchers at the @entity8 in @entity9 have studied the legs of giraffes and found that they were able to withstand huge forces thanks to a distinct groove that runs along the length of their shins , housing a structure called the suspensory ligament			1
this structure is found in other large animals , such as horses ‘ giraffes are heavy animals , around 1,000 kilograms ( 2,200 pounds ) , but have unusually skinny limb bones for an animal of this size ’ explained lead investigator @entity27 , a phd student in the @entity28 and @entity29 in other leg - related news , scientists looked at how kangaroos maintain their balance			1
when foraging for food , these usually majestic creatures look ungainly and awkward as they attempt to balance their heavy bodies			0
but now researchers have discovered that appearances may be deceiving , and their cumbersome movements are in fact helped by a fifth ‘ limb ’ ; their tails			0
scientists from @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 in @entity51 discovered that a kangaroo ’s tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined			0
' we found that when a kangaroo is walking , it uses its tail just like a leg , ' said associate professor @entity62 of @entity63 in in @entity50 , @entity51			0
‘ this means their leg bones are under high levels of mechanical stress			0
’ in giraffes , the equivalents to our metatarsal bone ( in the foot ) and metacarpal bone ( in the hand ) are extremely elongated , accounting for roughly half the leg length			0
a distinct groove runs along the length of these bones , housing a structure called the suspensory ligament			0
this structure is found in other large animals , such as horses - which are well known for their ability to sleep whilst standing - but this is the first time that it has been studied in giraffes			1
the researchers hypothesised that this arrangement may help solve the mystery of how the giraffes ' spindly legs can support its weight			1
to test this , the researchers received donations of limbs from @entity95 zoos ; these came from giraffes which had died naturally in captivity or been euthanised for reasons unrelated to this work			2
the limbs were then fixed in a rigid frame and , using a hydraulic press , the researchers applied forces of up to @entity102 ( around 250 kg ) , to simulate the bodyweight supported by each limb			2
it was found that the limbs remained upright and stable without any additional support and could even withstand greater loads			1
to test the strength of giraffe legs the researchers received donations of limbs from @entity95 zoos ; these came from giraffes which had died naturally in captivity or been euthanised for reasons unrelated to this work			1
the limbs were then fixed in a rigid frame and subjected to large forces , equivalent to the weight of a giraffe as the suspensory ligament is elastic tissue , and not muscle , it can not generate force itself so can only offer passive support			1
this means that giraffes can support their weight without actively engaging as much muscle , thereby reducing fatigue			2
the suspensory ligament is also thought to prevent the foot joints from overextending and protect the feet from collapsing			0
mr @entity27 hopes that this information will help to explain how giraffes evolved from small , antelope - like species to the iconic long - necked animals we know today			2
' i 'd like to link modern giraffes with fossil specimens to illustrate the process of evolution , ' mr @entity27 said			0
' we hypothesise that the suspensory ligament has allowed giraffes to reach large sizes that they otherwise would not have been able to achieve ' .			0

researchers at the @entity8 in @entity9 studied giraffe legs
they found the animals have a special ligament that supports their weight
giraffes weigh around 1,000 kilograms but have very spindly legs
was *previously* a mystery how their legs could support the immense weight
but in studies they found the legs could withstand huge forces
