glamorous in a red silk shirt and cosy fox fur stole , @entity2 might look like your typical fashion fan - but in fact , she 's anything but			1
instead of faux fur , ms @entity2 's collar is made entirely from roadkill - and she has now set up a business producing everything from collars to coats using mangled mink and squashed foxes			1
but her unusual designs do n't come cheap , with garments such as stoles costing , on average , £ 640 ( $ 1,000 ) each			1
' i ’ve always loved animals and have always worked on a farm , ' explains the 39 - year - old designer			0
' there ’s a lot of roadkill in @entity42 - a lot more cars and a lot more animals than many other countries			0
' i knew the idea would be popular but i did n’t know when it would take off - they are a real statement piece			0
' every piece made for her company , @entity24 , is created using animals killed on the road , with most supplied by the @entity57 and @entity58 who are licensed to collect them			2
the animals are then skinned , frozen and sent to a taxidermist before the fur is tanned and sewed in a lengthy process that takes up to 20 hours			1
each piece contains a silver badge detailing the type of creature involved in its manufacture , certification that the animal was made from roadkill and information on where it was found			0
but while ms @entity2 has had an overwhelmingly positive response to the furs , not everyone has welcomed the roadkill range			2
stylish : @entity2 strikes a pose in a shawl from @entity24 , which was made from a roadkill coyote lengthy process : creating the garments takes up to 20 hours each and they cost around £ 640 to buy particularly concerned are the anti-fur community with whom the designer initially tried to work before receiving a slew of negative responses			1
one particular complaint is that they encourage more fur in society despite being ethically made - unlike the regular variety			0
nevertheless , the majority of responses to the range have been positive , according to ms @entity2 , who adds : ' people are mainly grateful somebody is doing something respectful with animals			2
' chic : a model poses in a handwarmer made from a black bear that was killed in a traffic collision cosy : a model poses in red fox gauntlet gloves ( left ) and a furry neck muff ( right ) controversial : some in the anti-fur lobby say @entity2 's efforts encourage fur wearing			0

@entity2 uses roadkill to make everything in her fashion range
the @entity24 collection *includes* stoles , collars and coats
each takes up to 20 hours to make and is sewed and tanned by hand
as a result , the average price of a @entity24 piece is £ 640 ( $ 1,000 )
