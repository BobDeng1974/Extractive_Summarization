the @entity3 nurse fighting for her life after contracting @entity5 in @entity6 could remain in a critical condition for ' some time ' , her family said today			1
@entity8 was diagnosed with the deadly virus following her return to @entity11 from @entity6			1
the 39 - year - old had been a volunteer with @entity13 at the @entity14 in @entity15			1
she is currently being treated in isolation at the @entity17 in north @entity18			1
today , her relatives said in a statement : ' we would like to thank all our friends , family and the members of the public who have contacted us with support following @entity8 's diagnosis with @entity5			1
' we have been very touched by the kind words			2
we want to thank all the staff caring for her for their kindness , support and compassion			2
' @entity8 's condition could remain the same for some time and we would again ask for her and our privacy to be respected			1
' ms @entity8 was diagnosed with @entity5 following her return to @entity11 from @entity6 where she had been a volunteer with @entity13 at the @entity14 in @entity15			1
the 39 - year - old is currently being treated in isolation at the @entity17 in north @entity18			1
the nurse was admitted to an isolation facility at the @entity48 unit in @entity49 , @entity11 , at 8am on december 29			1
after a blood sample tested positive for @entity5 , she was transferred by military plane to the @entity17 the following day			1
her condition deteriorated in the new year and remains critical			0
at the @entity17 , where fellow nurse @entity53 recovered from @entity5 this year , she is in a cocooned bed in an isolation ward where medics treat her wearing protective suits			1
however one expert believes ms @entity8 has just a 50/50 chance of survival			1
dr @entity61 , a virologist from the @entity62 , said the experimental drug @entity63 used to treat nurse @entity53 at the same hospital would only be available sometime this month			1
it is therefore down to @entity8 's ' genetics ' as to whether she would pull through , he said			1
ms @entity8 is currently being treated in isolation at the @entity17 in @entity18 but with the experimental drug @entity63 used to treat nurse @entity53 ( pictured ) at the same hospital unavailable , it is now down to her ' genetics ' as to whether she would pull through , one expert said praising her efforts in fighting the deadly disease , he said : ' she 's a hero			1
nurses in particular are at the highest risk because they 've got to deal with bodily fluids which are full of the virus			0
' they 're brave , they 're great and i 'm glad they are helping sufferers in @entity83			0
' he added : ' at this point it 's about a 50/50 chance that she makes it			2
' people in the @entity90 have a better survival rate than in @entity83 - it 's something like 1 in 4 who died in comparison to about half or even three quarters in @entity97 hospitals			1
' there 's very little medical science can do to change the outcome			0
we do n't have any sure fire answers to @entity5			0
' some people will be resistant , other 's wo n't			0
a lot of it depends on genetics			2
' he added : ' a large part of @entity5 is essentially your own immune system beating you up			0
the longer that goes on , eventually you get blood leaking out and then it 's over			0
' prolonging it longer is a good thing so the body can build up antibodies but reducing the severity of the virus is the key thing			0
' you can kind of tell at this point what is going to be the outcome			0
ms @entity8 left @entity6 on her long journey back to @entity11 via @entity127 and @entity128 ' the clinical team will have a pretty good idea by this point			1
they 'll be able to tell by seeing the virus levels in her system			0
' @entity63 is a combination of three antibodies , little sticky things that are in people 's blood			0
' they ran out of this			0
they were supposed to be ready around the beginning of january - they must be close to being ready			2
' i have n't heard anything about it recently			0
we do n't know what the drug they are using to treat her is			2
' speaking of the international response to the outbreak he said : ' @entity5 has dropped out of the press but is killing about 50 people a day across the globe			0
' it 's not as serious as it was but it has killed off a lot of people			0
' @entity13 has launched an investigation into how she was infected but admits it may never establish the exact circumstances			0
health secretary @entity168 said ms @entity8 ' continues to receive the best possible care '			1
the decision by @entity128 officials to wave @entity172 through even though she said she felt ill sparked the search for 203 people who may have had contact with her on two flights with more health workers due to return to the @entity3 from @entity6 in the next two weeks , @entity178 first minister @entity177 pledged : ' we will keep all of the procedures under review			1
' it is important that we learn lessons from the case of @entity8 and that we learn lessons from any other case that might arise			1
' i hope there are no other cases identified in @entity178 or the @entity3 but it is likely we will see other cases , a small number of additional cases , and we need to keep learning from the experience of dealing with them			0
' yesterday a person with a ' history of travel to @entity83 ' tested negative for @entity5 after being placed in isolation at a @entity202 hospital			2
the person , who has recently returned from an area of @entity83 affected by the virus , was admitted to the @entity205 near @entity206 after developing a fever			0
a spokeswoman for @entity209 said : ' @entity209 can confirm that an individual tested for @entity5 earlier today at the @entity205 does not have the disease			2
' there may be other explanations for their symptoms for which tests are already under way			0
earlier this week , a briton who was feared to have the deadly virus tested negative for @entity5 at @entity220 hospital			0
the negative case follows two suspected patients last week - in @entity223 and @entity224 - who were also confirmed not to have the virus			2
the first safety trial of an experimental preventative @entity5 vaccine also began this week at a @entity3 university			2
the @entity229 , part of the @entity231 of @entity232 , aims to have vaccinated 72 healthy adults by the end of this month			0
developers of the drug , the @entity237 , have now accelerated it due to the continued spread of @entity5 in @entity83			2
@entity5 has so far killed 8,153 people and infected 20,656 in the past year , mainly in @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity6 , according to the latest @entity244 figures .			1

@entity8 , 39 , was diagnosed after returning from @entity6
is being treated at an isolation unit at the @entity17 , @entity18
@entity249 *issued* a statement today thanking well - *wishers* for their support
comes as one expert said her chances of survival could be 50/50
virologist dr @entity61 says that without the experimental drug @entity261 , it will be down to ' genetics ' as to whether ms @entity8 will pull through
