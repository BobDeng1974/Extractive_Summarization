by @entity0 and @entity1 a two - year - old boy from a remote village in @entity5 was ' patient zero ' in the deadliest - yet @entity8 outbreak , epidemiologists believe			1
the boy from the village of @entity11 , @entity12 province , suffered with fever , black stools and vomiting for just four days until he died on december 6			1
seven days later , his mother died too , followed by his three - year - old sister , who fell sick on @entity18 and was dead before she could see the @entity19			1
in a region where borders are porous , it gave the ebola virus a route into three nations where medical infrastructure is under strain at the best of times			1
researchers charted the spread to nearby communities by two mourners at the funeral of the original victim 's grandmother , who died january 1 , and the village midwife , who died february 2 , but not before infecting one of her relatives who had cared for her			1
but it was n't until march that the mystery sickness was recognised as @entity8 and , by that time , dozens of people had died in eight communities in @entity5 and suspected cases were emerging in @entity34 and @entity28			1
nine months after the first suspected case , described in @entity60 , and the @entity8 outbreak , centred on @entity5 , @entity28 and @entity34 , is the worst in history with nearly 1,000 victims so far			1
the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) said on friday it is an international health emergency likely to continue spreading for months			0
infection control : a health worker sprays disinfectant in an effort to curb the spread of the deadly ebola virus , which has killed nearly 1,000 so far this year the disease has put a severe strain on the health systems of affected states and governments have responded with a range of measures , including the declaration of national emergencies in @entity28 and @entity34			1
@entity81 has also declared a national emergency after seven confirmed cases of @entity8 in @entity84 , the country 's most populous city			1
today it was claimed that @entity88 border staff are threatening to go on strike , angry that not enough is being done to protect them from the chance that passengers arriving in @entity88 are infected with @entity8			1
@entity95 agents at @entity97 and @entity98 airports in @entity99 are angry no measures have been put in place to protect their health from the deadly illness , the @entity93 reported			0
an unnamed source told the paper there was ' panic ' among border staff			1
' people are scared and you ca n't blame them			0
many are n't confident we are going to be kept safe and this has led to strike talk among the staff , ' the source , described as an ' insider ' , said			2
the report came as medics announced the first person in @entity120 to be treated for @entity8 will be given an experimental drug to treat the deadly virus			1
@entity124 priest @entity123 , 75 , remains in isolation in a hospital in @entity127 after being flown back from @entity34 on thursday			1
he is believed to have contracted the disease while treating patients with @entity8 at a hospital his catholic humanitarian group runs			2
doctors were today given the go - ahead to treat him with @entity135 , which has already been administered to two @entity138 health workers repatriated to the @entity139 after falling ill with the disease			2
supplies of the drug were flown from @entity142 in @entity143 to @entity127 's @entity145 hospital where mr @entity123 is being cared for round - the - clock			1
he remained in a stable condition today and did not have the profuse bleeding which is a sign the virus is at an advanced stage			0
mr @entity123 brother @entity152 said : ' we have scant news and are just waiting			0
' we 'll go to see him when they say we can but at the moment what interests us is that he remains stable			0
' @entity8 is not easy to catch			2
it is not airborne and can only spread through contact with the bodily fluid of victims			0
but it has reaped a high toll on health workers			0
@entity34 alone has lost at least three doctors to the virus and 32 health workers			0
@entity28 's @entity168 said a senior physician had contracted the disease at the @entity172 referral hospital in the capital , @entity26			0
dr. @entity174 contracted the disease ' after treating a patient ... who was later proved to have the virus and died , ' said ministry spokesman @entity178			2
dr @entity174 was taken to an ebola treatment centre in eastern @entity183 district , run by medical charity @entity184 , dr @entity178 said			0
he is the latest @entity28 doctor to contract the virus			0
the country 's leading @entity8 doctor , @entity186 , died of the disease last month and several nurses have also died after caring for patients			1
health workers wearing protective clothing and equipment sit at a desk at the @entity24 a @entity5 government minister said earlier on saturday at a news conference that the country had closed its borders with @entity28 and @entity34 to halt the spread of @entity8			1
authorities said the decision was taken primarily to prevent infected people crossing into @entity5 , where at least 367 people have died of @entity8 since march and 18 others are being treated in isolation			1
however , state television later said the borders remained open , in an about - face that appeared to highlight the difficulties governments face in coordinating policy in the face of the fast - moving outbreak			1
' @entity5 has not closed its borders with @entity28 or with @entity34			0
it 's rather that we have taken health measures at the border posts , ' the television channel said			0
a government source said the minister who made the original announcement had not been in possession of accurate information			0
one of the deadliest diseases known to humanity , @entity8 has no proven cure and there is no vaccine to prevent infection			2
the most effective treatment involves alleviating symptoms that include fever , vomiting and diarrhoea			2
the rigorous use of quarantine is needed to prevent its spread , as well as high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with the disease			0
these measures have proved hard to enforce given that @entity8 has spread in rural parts of some of the world 's poorest countries			1
the task is made harder because of mistrust of health workers in areas with inadequate public health services			0
medics await patients to screen for @entity8 in the tent outside the @entity24 the @entity64 said on friday 961 people have died during the outbreak and 1,779 have been infected			1
the infections and deaths have led to tests on suspected @entity8 cases around the world			2
authorities in @entity263 said they were testing samples from a man from @entity266 who died while being transported to hospital in the @entity268			0
' he had fever and was bleeding from the nose so we are testing him for @entity8 because we do n't want to take chances , ' @entity269 , medical head at @entity270 , said by telephone			1
@entity263 has previously conducted about 20 @entity8 tests , though none has proved positive			2
test results for a patient being treated in a @entity283 - area hospital for a suspected case of @entity8 are due within 24 hours , @entity279 's health ministry said on saturday			1
the patient recently came to @entity286 from @entity81			0
authorities in @entity288 also said they were testing a patient for @entity8 , the second suspected case in the country , while @entity291 's @entity168 said initial tests on a dead @entity291 citizen suspected of having @entity8 were negative			2
international alarm over the spread of the disease increased last month when a @entity138 citizen died in @entity81 after travelling there by plane from @entity34			2
since then , other countries with no cases of the disease have taken measures as a precaution			0
@entity303 said it would restrict the entry of travellers from countries affected by the virus and would ban @entity303 from travelling to those countries , in one of the strictest actions by any nation outside of @entity312			0
@entity303 's @entity168 also advised against holding any ' international events ' such as conferences and other gatherings , citing concerns about controlling potential outbreaks			0
@entity319 's @entity318 said any planes flying to the capital , @entity322 , should not pick up passengers at airports in @entity325 , @entity26 or @entity326 .			0
