born with a rare facial deformity , @entity15 , from @entity18 , @entity19 , was diagnosed just days after birth with cavernous haemangioma finally this year , after a lifetime of juggling everyday life with hospital appointments , @entity15 is celebrating the end of her surgery as she turns 40 @entity15 was born with china doll features and perfectly clear skin until a tiny pink mark appeared on her cheek a few hours later			1
doctors discovered she had a rare condition called cavernous haemangioma which causes blood vessels under the skin to swell			1
within weeks the small mark had swollen into a huge , hard red mass filled with blood that distorted @entity15 ’s face			1
her lips burst open , she could n’t open her right eye and she could barely breathe as the mass spread across her face , around her head and down into her throat			2
her condition meant that she suffered severe headaches and struggled to eat			2
even a slight knock to her face would cause it to haemorrhage going through puberty was particularly hard and @entity15 ( pictured centre ) was bullied at school : some children even refused to speak to her , believing she was contagious doctors feared @entity15 would n't survive and at six weeks old her parents chose to have her christened and read her last rights			1
however she defied the odds and after 14 months in hospital @entity15 was sent home			1
her condition meant that she suffered severe headaches and struggled to eat			2
even a slight knock to her face would cause it to haemorrhage			2
people would stop and stare and when she joined a playgroup parents complained she looked too frightening			2
at aged four @entity15 began having the first of 82 major operations to remove the mass but it had distorted the underlying bone structure , pushing @entity15 ’s face to one side			1
' one of my earliest memories is sitting in my bedroom and licking my baby photos and scratching the face off them			2
@entity80 found them all cut up in the fireplace in my room and was devastated			2
' @entity15 on her wedding day with husband @entity84 who she met in a nightclub going through puberty was particularly hard and @entity15 was bullied at school			1
some children even refused to speak to her , believing she was contagious			2
as she grew older , @entity15 realised she had a choice - she could either hide away , or she could make the best of things			1
@entity15 made the decision not to let her health problems hold her back			1
she decided to train to be a nurse			2
now working as a senior health care assistant @entity15 says : ' the patients were too wrapped up in their own problems to bother about me			1
at least i was doing something worthwhile			0
' as well as her job , @entity15 enjoyed an active social life , often going out with friends			1
' being born with a facial deformity has taught me things in life that i would never have known otherwise			0
no matter what anyone else thinks i know i ’ve been very lucky			0
’ one night when out at a nightclub with her cousin she met her future husband @entity111 , now 41			0
' he recognised me from the local paper and said he thought i was very brave			0
' we got on really well but i assumed he was doing it to be kind			0
after all he could have any girl			0
' as their relationship developed @entity111 told her : ‘ you ’re strong , caring and better than any of them			0
despite what you ’ve been through you ’re happy and kind			0
' a fairy tale wedding followed and afterwards they tried for a baby			0
when nothing happened they turned to @entity127 which failed			0
' we decided to book a holiday in @entity130 and planned to undergo a second round when we returned			0
but while swimming with dolphins one kept nudging @entity15 ’s stomach - and on her return she discovered she was already pregnant			1
when @entity136 was born ( on @entity137 ) the couple were thrilled			0
as @entity138 got older she knew @entity15 looked different			1
@entity15 would just tell her : ' it 's cool to have a mum that 's unique , ' and @entity136 would tell her friends the same			1
meanwhile after not having surgery for a few years @entity15 began suffering from eye infections and cellulitis			1
@entity15 told daughter @entity136 ( pictured left ) ' it 's cool to have a mum that 's unique , ' and @entity136 would tell her friends the same she began undergoing more major surgery during which doctors removed the old silicone prosthesis from her right cheek and rebuilt the area with a rod and soft mesh , in a bid to help reconstruct the area where the tumours had been , leaving a large concave area at the side of her face			1
in all she had eight more excruciating procedures			0
' " you look beautiful " @entity138 would smile when she saw me , even though i was bruised and bandaged			0
' but finally after a lifetime of surgery and , as she recently celebrated her 40th birthday , she has now vowed enough is enough			1
‘ a major chapter has come to an end and i ’m finally free			2
i feel fabulous the way i am			0
‘ there have been incredible highs and lows because of my deformity			0
among other things i was presented with a @entity178 for triumph over adversity by @entity181 - which i 'd never have experienced otherwise			0
' being born with a facial deformity has taught me things in life that i would never have known otherwise			0
‘ i ’ve got a wonderful job , a husband who loves me and a gorgeous daughter			0
no matter what anyone else thinks i know i ’ve been very lucky			0
