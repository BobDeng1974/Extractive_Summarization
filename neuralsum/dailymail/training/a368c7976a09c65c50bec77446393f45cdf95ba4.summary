ever thought that giving up your favourite sweet treat was almost impossible ? scientists at the @entity3 have found that feeding rats a junk food diet made it harder for the rats to return to a healthy diet			1
this study could explain why it 's harder for overweight people to avoid high calorie foods			1
junk food could actually be changing your brain 's ability to eat healthy food the study published in @entity19 led by professor @entity20 helps explain how excessive consumption of junk food can change behavior , weaken self - control and lead to overeating and obesity.the team of researchers taught young male rats to associate two different sound cues with a two particular flavours of sugar water			1
healthy rats , raised on a healthy diet , stopped responding to cues linked to a flavour they had recently overindulged in			0
this instinctive mechanism in animals protects against overeating and promotes a healthy , balanced diet			2
the key to why junk food is so addictive may have been found after two weeks on a diet that included pies , dumplings , cookies and cake – with 150 per cent more calories – the rats ’ weight increased by 10 per cent and their behaviour changed dramatically			1
they became indifferent in their food choices and no longer avoided the sound advertising the over familiar taste , indicating they had lost their natural preference for novelty			0
the change lasted for some time after the rats returned to a healthy diet			0
' we think that a junk diet causes lasting changes in the reward circuit parts of the rats ’ brains in the area responsible for decision - making , ' said professor @entity70			0
the researchers think that a junk diet causes lasting changes in the area of the brain responsible for decision - making ' because the brain ’s reward circuitry is similar in all mammals , this could have implications for people ’s ability to limit their intake of certain kinds of foods			2
' ' if the same thing happens in humans , eating junk food may change our responses to signals associated with food rewards			2
it ’s like you ’ve just had ice cream for lunch , yet you still go and eat more when you hear the ice cream van comes by , ' she explained			0
dr @entity99 from the @entity100 in @entity101 says : ' as the global obesity epidemic intensifies , advertisements may have a greater effect on people who are overweight and make purchases of snacks like chocolate bars harder to resist			0
' ultimately the study shows that if the human brain works like the rats brain , junk food is almost an addiction that our bodies are not able to resist			1
rats on the two week high calorie diet had a harder time readjusting to their healthy balanced diet and saw an increase in their weight			1

scientists at @entity124 's @entity3 may have found the reason why overweight people *struggle* to give up *fat*ty foods
the @entity3 study could prove that particular high calorie foods are addictive
the study *performed* on rats shows that junk food not only makes rats *fat* , it also stops them from seeking out a balanced diet
