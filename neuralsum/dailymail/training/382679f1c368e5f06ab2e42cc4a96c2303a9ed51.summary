by @entity0 while it 's always good to listen to your feelings , women 's tendency to follow their hearts over their heads means that men are far more decisive than women – and they do n’t feel the need to ask for advice either			1
when it comes to making decisions , men are twice as likely as women to decide ' right away '			1
and although women take longer to come to decisions , and are twice as likely as men to consult their partner before making them , they are more inclined to regret their choices further down the line			1
which to follow - the head or heart ? women and men make decisions very differently the research , commissioned by swimming pool builders @entity28 , asked 2,000 men and women to evaluate their decisions in life and found women are much more likely to consider the opinions of friends and take time on their choices , while men adopt a more immediate process			1
a quarter of women said their approach was often to spend a long time mulling over the details of a decision before making it - but less than a fifth of men take the same approach			2
when a choice requires a bit of soul - searching , women are more likely to do something ‘ from the heart ’ than are blokes results found			0
psychologist @entity50 said : ‘ there are stark differences between how men and women make decisions			1
women ’s significant reliance on others plus a reluctance to make a wrong decision points to a measurable lack of confidence compared to men			1
’ ‘ weighing up different outcomes and scenarios may seem like a good strategy but it appears to be accompanied by increasing levels of stress and uncertainty			0
going round in circles soon becomes counterproductive and leads to decision paralysis and feelings of frustration			0
’ the study also found a quarter of @entity77 find it easier to make really big decisions than smaller ones , trusting their gut for ‘ life - changing ’ choices like whether to buy a house or propose to a partner , but then agonising over things like buying new clothes			1
women spend longer on choices such as buying new jeans or shoes , and are more likely to consult a friend for advice @entity50 adds : “ heart and gut feelings operate at a much faster and more primitive level than regular thought processes			1
“ the heart is based on emotion , the gut on survival			0
gut feelings should n’t be dismissed as rash - 95 % of the human body ’s feel - good neurotransmitter serotonin is produced by the gut			0
” seven in ten of us are prone to making bad decisions and more than half of the participants felt they were indecisive			1
women are more likely than men to change their minds , and deliberate more over everything from whether to go on holiday or hand in notice at work , suffering the most back and forth on decisions around changing the look of their house or re-decorating			2
however , men showed more indecision than the fairer sex when it came to putting an offer in for a house , talking to someone they find attractive or deciding whether or not to ask a partner to move in			0
when thinking about the big decisions in their lives so far women cited starting a family as the biggest they ’d made , while men chose buying a property			2
interestingly , women were more likely than men to feel they get the smaller decisions wrong in life while men are most likely to feel they get big decisions wrong			2
but there are certain decisions we all make on the spot ; one in five people in relationships knew they wanted to be with their partner within minutes of meeting			0
men know sooner after meeting someone if they want to be in a relationship with that person , with 41 per cent making up their minds on the same day , compared to less than a third of women			0
and a third of homeowners knew their current property was for them almost instantly upon viewing it			0
so as long as we know what we want in our love life and home life , we should be alright .			0

men are twice as likely as women to decide ' right away '
despite consulting others , women are more inclined to regret their choices
women make decisions form the heart , while men follow their heads
seven in ten @entity77 describe themselves as indecisive
