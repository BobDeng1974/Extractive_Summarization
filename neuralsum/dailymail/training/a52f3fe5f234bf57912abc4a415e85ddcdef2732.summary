mr @entity16 , 34 , said : ' all of a sudden i saw a flash of white in the tree			0
i looked up and thought i saw a cuddly toy - it was white and fluffy			0
' then i realised it was a squirrel and another all white one bounded round the branch			0
it was brilliant , my daughters were absolutely delighted			0
' my youngest kept asking for a kiss , and @entity10 asked if she could have one			0
i ’ve never seen an albino squirrel before , let alone two			2
' the mother squirrel protects her rare babies while on the tree while one of the albino squirrel twins plays with its mother , the second sibling nibbles on some nuts mr @entity16 said one of his daughters wanted to kiss a squirrel while the other wanted to take them home the family have been returning to the tree to see whether they can spot the squirrels again			1
mr @entity16 said : ' they were hugging , it was absolutely adorable			0
' the squirrels are obviously quite young , because their mum was sat on a branch higher up , keeping an eye on them			2
' we decided to name them @entity30 because you can really see their red eyes against their white fur			1
' while the family were watching the squirrel show , one of the albino rodents decided to go for a run across the grass @entity30 and @entity83 face an uncertain future as their bright coats mean they are highly visible to predators unfortunately , @entity30 and @entity83 's future looks quite bleak as their unusual colour means they can be easily spotted by predators			1
