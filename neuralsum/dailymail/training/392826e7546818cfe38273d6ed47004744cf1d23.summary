the @entity1 bank said the loss was caused by unauthorised trades on stock index futures made over the past three months			1

suspected rogue trader @entity8 , 31 , leaves @entity22 magistrates court where he was charged with fraud at banking giant @entity4 the bank said that ' the true magnitude of the risk exposure was distorted ' because the hedges that traders are required to put in place had been fabricated			2
@entity1 ’s biggest lender also suggested that the trades in question involved ' unauthorised speculative ' bets on various @entity36 500 , @entity37 and @entity38 index futures , rather than on the @entity1 franc , as some had thought			1
@entity4 claims that the non-existent hedges entered into its records were ' fictitious , forward - settling , cash etf [ exchange - traded fund ] positions ' , trades that had never actually been executed			0
@entity4 also countered suggestions that it did not notice the trades until @entity8 came forward			0
they said the 31 - year - old trader – charged on friday with fraud and false accounting – had been responding to the bank ’s inquiries			2
