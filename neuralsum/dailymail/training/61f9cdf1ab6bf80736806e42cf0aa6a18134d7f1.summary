by @entity0 the son of famed @entity3 broadcaster @entity2 accused of stabbing to death his ex-girlfriend had an unbelievably long history of violence against women that began when he was just 17			1
documents show a trail of five terrorized girlfriends who @entity14 , now 35 , allegedly brutalized or threatened to kill beginning in the late 1990s and continuing steadily until his arrest for murder on august 15			1
despite the endless accusations , constant threats and visible wounds sported by girlfriends and friends who crossed him , @entity3 - area judges only found the beloved baseball announcer 's son guilty twice out of 18 total charges since 1998			1
the @entity42 dug deep into @entity14 's past and found nearly 20 years worth of glaring warning signs that the hulking admitted steroid abuser was capable of uncontrolled violence			1
but those warnings went unheeded			0
and , as the @entity42 writes , @entity14 became ' the king of second chances			2
' ' this is an old story for the @entity53 judicial system			0
you get a high - priced attorney , you get better justice , ' former @entity57 , @entity33 prosecutor @entity58 , who once tried and failed to convince a jodge to give @entity14 a real punishment			1
' if he had been @entity62 from a well - off family , he may have gotten the same result			0
' while the story may be old , @entity14 's tale is far from typical			1
not only had he faced 18 criminal charges over the years by the time he entered his not guilty plea to ruthlessly stabbing 27 - year - old @entity69 , the mother of his daughter , but 10 of those times he walked free despite being on probation or having pending charges			1
the @entity42 notes that @entity14 's allegedly abhorrent treatment of the females in his life first became noticeable in 1996			1
just after his son was asked to leave a special school for youths with aggression problems , @entity2 asked @entity82 police to speak with @entity14 , who was allegedly harassed and ' pushed ' a girl he 'd recently broken up with			1
history of violence : the admitted steroid abuser collected nearly twenty criminal charges dating back to the late 1990s , but his violent history did not stop @entity3 - area judges from continually offering the son of a beloved @entity3 personality probation and continuances instead of harsher punishments unbelievable : @entity14 was in and out of the court system but was only ever given two guilty verdicts famous father : @entity14 's father is famed @entity3 broadcaster and former big leaguer @entity2 it was the first of long list of progressively more serious accusations against the sportscaster scion			1
@entity14 's next girlfriend was @entity104			2
she was three years his junior when they began dating			0
she would give birth to their baby at 16 , when @entity14 was 19			2
the following year , in 1998 , @entity14 would be charged with choking and hitting @entity104 in his parents driveway while she held their baby			1
with the help of his attorney @entity111 , @entity14 would get what is called a ' continuance without a finding , ' or @entity115 , which means @entity14 could be sentenced without the court actually ruling against him			2
he received one year of probation and was told he must get counseling			0
it was the first of a stunning six @entity120 that judges would hand @entity14 , largely for assaulting or threatening women			1
@entity14 's wealthy parents paid for him to get some of the best legal representation money could buy ... and he needed it			2
the 35 - year - old 's run - ins with the law began in the mid 1990s and before the new millennium had already been accused of threatening his girlfriends			1
six of @entity14 's criminal charges ended with a ' continuance without a finding ' or @entity115			2
a @entity115 allowed the judges to give @entity14 probation without actually determining his innocence or guilt			0
@entity14 was on probation after @entity115 rulings , or had pending charges , at the time of 10 of his arrests the first of these alleged incidents occurred in 1996 , when a concerned @entity2 called police to speak with his son who he believed had threatened and pushed an ex-girlfriend at just 17			1
@entity14 's next girlfriend also became the mother of this baby			1
@entity104 was just 16 when she gave birth			0
son after , @entity14 was accused of beating and choking her as she held their infant child			1
later , he was accused of smashing a bottle of his friend 's head for hanging out with @entity160			0
@entity161 accused @entity14 of threatening to kill her and of slashing her friend 's car tires after the two of them broke up			1
@entity14 's girlfriend @entity167 got a restraining order against @entity14 , who she said bloodied her nose and threatened her life , among other appalling acts			2
@entity14 racked up about 20 criminal charges before he finally was found covered in @entity174 's blood last summer			2
of those charges , he was found guilty just two times			0
tragic : @entity177 accused @entity14 of threatening and abusing her in august 2013			1
she filed for a protective order , but did n't show up to court to have the emergency order extended			0
@entity14 was allowed to go free august 13 , 2013			0
two days later , @entity177 would be dead before his probation was up , @entity14 was charged with smashing a beer bottle over his friend 's head , reportedly because the friend was involved with his now - ex girlfriend @entity104			1
he would receive another @entity115 and an extended probation for that charge			0
@entity14 's next girlfriend @entity161 would also accuse him of threatening her , but after she failed to testify against him , the charges eventually faded away			1
in may of 2000 , @entity14 got two more @entity191 : one for possession of hypodermic needles and another related to an incident in which he was reportedly causing a scene in his driveway as he screamed at his mother and then elbowed a responding police officer			2
the next girlfriend to allege that @entity14 beat her was @entity167			0
most notable among his more dubious interactions with @entity167 was a 2003 incident in which @entity14 was booked and then bailed out on charges he was terrorizing her and then allegedly called to threaten @entity167 twenty minutes after his arrest from front right in front of the police station			0
nearly eight years went by before @entity208 was again charged with a violent crime , an august 13 , 2013 assault charge police filed on behalf of @entity69			2
she was dead two days later			0
' no parents are immune from trouble with their children , ' said @entity2			0
' my wife and i did everything we could to provide @entity14 with the necessary professional help ' in court , prosecutors described a brutal and determined attack , saying @entity14 assaulted @entity208 in the kitchen , living room , on a stairway and then pinned her to the ground in the patio where he stabbed her several times			0
neighbors who tried to help @entity208 were driven back when @entity14 slashed at them , @entity233 assistant district attorney @entity232 told a judge			0
@entity14 was arrested at the scene , his clothes soaked in the victim 's blood			2
@entity208 's mother told the @entity240 that her daughter had been ' planning her escape ' when she was allegedly murdered by her long - time boyfriend			1
' she said , " i was planning my escape , " ' @entity245 , 53 , said			0
' this was on wednesday			0
she said , " do n’t worry , i ’m planning my escape			0
" ' @entity245 said her daughter had returned to her apartment to get her belongings before fleeing			0
@entity14 's murder trial has been scheduled for october this year			1
he 's pleaded not guilty and thus far has maintained that he 's innocent of killing @entity208			0
horrific : @entity208 was in the midst of her escape from life with @entity14 when he allegedly surprised her in their home and stabbed her to death , leaving a trail of blood throughout the house witnesses : a neighbor at the couple 's @entity264 townhouse says he tried pulling @entity2 off of @entity177 , but it was no use			1
she was dead by the time help arrived			0
