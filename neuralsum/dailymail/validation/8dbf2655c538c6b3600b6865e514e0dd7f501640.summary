@entity0 fears @entity1 is running out of steam and is searching for the right moment to give the Â£ 32million @entity5 striker a well - earned break			1
only per @entity7 has played more for @entity8 this season than @entity1 , who has played for 3,326 minutes in his debut campaign , scoring 19 goals but only one in his last 11 appearances			1
' he 's a bit fatigued and in a position where he has scored less , ' said boss @entity0			1
' he wants to force his game and then is more involved in physical battles			0
maybe goalscoring is on his mind , so he wants to do too much and he wants to force his game			0
@entity1 has played more minutes this season than every @entity8 player except @entity7 manager @entity0 has considered resting the @entity5 international because he is fatigued but @entity0 concedes the games are too important to leave out his star 19 - goal forward despite his early - season form the former @entity26 attacker has only netted once in his last 11 games ' i 'm tempted to give him a break at some stage			1
i have been for a long time			0
it 's not that he wo n't let me , i will decide that			0
it 's just that every game now is so important , you always have a hesitation to do it			0
' @entity8 are at @entity40 in the @entity41 on saturday , and @entity0 will expect a reaction after sliding out of the @entity43 on tuesday			2
the trip to @entity45 may present a good opportunity to rest @entity1 , with plenty of available options , including @entity49 set to return after illness , and the manager attempting to keep his squad fresh for the @entity54 defence and to finish as high as possible in the @entity41			2
@entity1 in action as @entity8 crashed out of the champions leaguedespite a 2 - 0 win against @entity58 @entity1 and his team - mates prepare for saturday 's @entity41 clash with @entity40 @entity0 believes @entity8 are too far behind league leaders @entity62 to make a late push for the title @entity65 claimed @entity8 were back in the title race after a two - point swing last weekend , even though they remain seven points behind leaders @entity62 with a game fewer to play			1
@entity0 said : ' at the moment we are too far away from @entity62 , but we have an opportunity every week to get closer and for that we need positive results from us and negative results from @entity62			2
i believe @entity62 still has a very good cushion and very good security			0

@entity1 has scored 19 goals so far in his debut season in @entity82
@entity8 forward has only netted once in his last 11 games though
@entity0 says the @entity5 international is fatigued and needs a rest
but @entity0 *admits* the games are too important to leave @entity1 out
