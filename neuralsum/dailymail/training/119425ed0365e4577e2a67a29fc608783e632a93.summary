@entity2 researchers watched videos of women walking , and were able to tell whether they regularly had orgasms from intercourse			1
at the @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity2 , they set about proving the theory right			1
they took women with known histories of either vaginal orgasm or inability to orgasm from sex and videotaped them walking on the street , and their orgasmic status was judged by sexologists blind to their history			1
‘ in the sample of healthy young @entity2 women , half of whom were vaginally orgasmic , history of vaginal orgasm that was triggered solely by penile - vaginal intercourse , was diagnosable at far better than chance			1
the researchers think that , as well as having an effect on people 's mental health , orgasms can ' loosen ' muscle groups			2
they wrote : ‘ research has demonstrated the association between vaginal orgasm and better mental health			0
some theories of psychotherapy assert a link between muscle blocks and disturbances of both character and sexual function			2
in functional - @entity53 therapy , one focus of treatment is amelioration of voluntary movement			0
' the present study examines the association of general everyday body movement with history of vaginal orgasm			0
’ the team said the objective was to determine if appropriately trained sexologists could infer women 's history of vaginal orgasm from observing only their gait			2
the walk of a woman who has had orgasms , but not from intercourse with a man is visibly different ‘ @entity72 orgasm history was unrelated to both ratings and to vaginal orgasm history			1
exploratory analyses suggest that greater pelvic and vertebral rotation and stride length might be characteristic of the gait of women who have experienced vaginal orgasm			0
‘ the discerning observer may infer women 's experience of vaginal orgasm from a gait that comprises fluidity , energy , sensuality , freedom , and absence of both flaccid and locked muscles			0
' results are discussed with regard to previous research on gait , the effect of the musculature on sexual function , the special nature of vaginal orgasm , and implications for sexual therapy			0

woman who have orgasms from sexual intercourse walk differently
@entity2 researchers watched videos of women walking , and could tell difference
