by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 insists he is not getting carried away with the club 's 100 per cent start to the @entity7 season			1
@entity9 's men followed up their shock opening - day win at @entity12 by beating battling @entity13 at the @entity14 , @entity3 withstanding pressure for most of the second half after @entity17 had given them a 23rd - minute lead			1
but @entity9 is fully aware of the pitfalls of management , even though he has only been in the @entity3 hot - seat for eight months			2
@entity24 : @entity3 scorer @entity17 ( third right ) and his team - mates celebrate after his goal against @entity13 @entity28 : @entity3 boss @entity2 is delighted with the ' best start ' possible but will not get carried away all smiles : @entity2 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) share a joke before saturday 's @entity7 match ' it 's a fantastic start and great to have six points , i 'm not going to lie about that , ' @entity2 said after the game			1
' the way i am , the players know we have a ( @entity44 ) game on tuesday and that is what we focus on			0
' it 's the best start we could have had , but we know we are only two games from being on your back and getting dragged down			0
' we have to build on what we 've done and improve on mistakes			2
' @entity2 was delighted with how @entity3 withstood @entity13 's second - half assault , with goalkeeper @entity52 only really stretched once when @entity53 burst onto @entity55 ' pass and forced a fine save from the @entity58 international			1
' it was very hard			0
the first half we controlled the game and if we could have got a second that would have made it easier , ' @entity2 said			2
' we spoke at half - time that they would throw everything at us and we were n't at our fluent best , but we dug in and defended well			2
goalscorer : @entity13 goalkeeper @entity67 was unable to keep @entity17 's shot out of the net despite his best efforts ' @entity13 were in a no - lose situation but we limited them to one shot on target and defended very well the whole game			1
' we know we have to show the other side of the game and there are times when you have to dig in			0
' the boys were magnificent in that respect and that comes from the work we have done in pre-season			0
' we would have liked it to be more comfortable but six points in two games is all you can ask for			0
' @entity13 boss @entity32 admits his newly - promoted @entity13 are on a fast learning curve after losing their opening two games to @entity92 and @entity3 , but he remains positive with what he sees as signs of progress			1
' we showed them too much respect in the first half and that can happen for a team that 's just been promoted , ' said @entity32			2
' the early part of the season it 's about believing that they belong and the first half we did n't do that and they were the better side			0
team effort : @entity3 , pictured celebrating @entity17 's goal , proved to be too strong for @entity13 ' the second half we played with that freedom and i thought we were terrific - the quality and energy of play and the framework of the team to make sure we did n't give chances away			1
' i 'm not naive enough to think the growth period does n't have to be quick because it does			0
' but there were good signs against @entity92 because they 're a different animal at the moment			0
' @entity3 are not @entity92 yet and , though they 've done fantastic and they 're a very good side , this was probably a more realistic challenge which we applied ourselves to			1
' and @entity32 insists that @entity13 will be able to compete in the @entity7 as the season unfolds			1
' i want them to play with freedom , quality and energy and i thought we did that in the second half , ' he added			0
' that 's the challenge you 've got and there 's times you 'll take an ugly 1 - 0 as any manager would , but the belief is there that we can compete at this level			1
' i want us to be brave , but not in a naive way , we want to play on the front foot , create chances and win games			0
' there were times when we might have to change slightly but i did n't feel that was necessary today , even against a very good team like @entity3			0
' in the net : @entity13 players look on after the ball nestles into his net in the first half against @entity3			1

@entity3 beat @entity13 1 - 0 at the @entity14 with a @entity17 strike
they left @entity157 with a 2 - 1 win over @entity12 last *weekend*
@entity2 says it is a ' fantastic start ' but @entity161 must ' build on ' this and improve
@entity3 boss *impressed* with how side dealt with @entity13 in second half
@entity13 boss @entity32 says his side must learn quickly to survive
