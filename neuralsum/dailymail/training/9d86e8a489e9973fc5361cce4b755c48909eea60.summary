a grandmother has become @entity2 ’s oldest banned driver at the age of 86 after being handed five speeding tickets			1
@entity5 was caught doing 48mph in a 30mph zone while driving her @entity8 in march - her fifth speeding offence in four years			1
the retired primary headteacher had previously been caught breaking the speed limit on september 10 and december 5 last year , as well as august 7 , 2011 , and march 18 , 2010			2
@entity5 , 86 , was handed a six month driving ban after being caught doing 46mph in a 30mph zone in march - her fifth speeding offence in four years @entity5 , who has four children , five grandchildren and one great - grandchild , appeared at @entity19 on monday after getting 13 penalty points , meaning a court has to consider a ban			1
she pleaded guilty to speeding and deputy district judge @entity23 banned her from the road for six months			2
the most recent speeding offence happened at 12.36pm on march 30 when @entity5 was taking letters to a person after they were delivered to her home by mistake			1
the court heard she was flashed by a speed camera travelling at 48mph as she went on her errand in @entity33 , @entity19			1
the judge endorsed @entity5 ’s licence with four additional penalty points , fined her £ 200 and ordered her to pay a £ 20 victim surcharge and £ 85 costs			1
the mother - of - four , from @entity40 , near @entity41 , @entity42 , was also ordered to re-take her driving test after she completed her ban			1
@entity45 , defending , said a small disqualification would be sufficient , avoiding the need for a ban under the totting - up procedure			2
he said : ' mrs @entity5 lives in a remote and rural area with the nearest shop in @entity52 , @entity19 , being four to five miles away			1
' he added that of her four children , only one of them lived nearby and that the son had to care for his wife who had a severe disability			0
mr @entity45 said that if @entity5 was banned she would be reliant on friends for transport			1
he added : ' for a short disqualification the situation would be manageable but for a longer period would prove somewhat unbearable			0
' despite his pleas , the judge ruled her repeated law breaking warranted a ban			0
the @entity70 has since confirmed @entity5 is @entity2 ’s oldest banned driver			1
@entity5 's solicitor argued that a ban would make it difficult for the mother - of - four to visit her relatives , three of whom live a long way from her home - but the judge @entity19 ( pictured ) ruled otherwise according to official records the oldest person with at least 12 points on their licence is an 85 - year - old man			1
the oldest person to have any points on their licence is a 103 - year - old man , and the oldest woman with a single point on her licence is 102			1
@entity89 of @entity5 , who lives in a £ 300,000 home , expressed their sympathy today			2
one said : ' this is yet another example of the courts using a sledgehammer to crack a nut			0
there are far worse drivers out there			0
' we will rally round for @entity5 as much as we can and help her out as much as possible			2
' speaking from her home today , speeding gran @entity5 said she was ' ashamed ' of her ban			1
she said : ' i do n’t want everybody to know about it			0
my solicitor has asked for it to be called again			0
he was n’t happy with the result			0
i do n’t know if it will but we will see			0
' it is all a blur , a bad memory			0
altogether i was caught three times in a year in the same place in @entity52 , coming through at more than 30mph			2
so i have to just put up with it			0
' i have had my licence cancelled so i wo n’t be able to drive until after @entity119			0
it is just one of those things			0
i have got friends who will take me around thankfully			0
