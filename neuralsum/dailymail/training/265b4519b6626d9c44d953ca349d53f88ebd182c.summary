by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 18:15 est , 4 may 2013 @entity1 inspired love and loathing , but even her greatest detractors could never dispute her work ethic – the @entity1 survived on four hours ’ sleep at night and was known to see holidays as something that got in the way of toil			1
as a result , little light has been shed on how she spent her time away from the coalface at @entity14 and the @entity15			2
but dr @entity20 and his wife @entity21 , owners of @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , can offer some insight into how she liked to spend her rare weekends away from the pressures of office , because the @entity1 were regular visitors to @entity17 in the @entity27			1
happy union : the exterior of @entity17 - an amalgamation of three workers ' dwelling retired gastroenterologist @entity20 , 75 , a great - great - nephew of dr @entity34 , founder of the children ’s charity , and @entity21 , 73 , a retired bereavement counsellor , were prospective buyers of @entity17 in 1998 when they noticed photographs on the walls of @entity1 and her husband @entity40 relaxing in the garden of this grand country abode			1
it transpires that the @entity1 had been weekend guests of the man who sold @entity17 to the @entity45 , sir @entity44 , who lived there with his wife @entity46			1
sir @entity44 enjoyed a high - flying career with the @entity50 confectionary group before working with the @entity51 in the @entity27 as a marketing adviser			1
along with @entity53 and @entity54 , he masterminded the @entity51 election victories of 1983 and 1987			0
he was among the @entity1 ’s most trusted confidants – she described him in her memoirs as ‘ that rare and useful animal , a businessman with acute political instincts ’			1
but the @entity1 ’ invitations to @entity17 may well have come through @entity40 , as he and sir @entity62 were golfing partners			1
sir @entity44 died in 2007 , aged 84			0
@entity64 : the dining room at five - bedroom property in @entity67 , on the market for £ 1.5million one can see why the @entity1 enjoyed coming here			1
it is difficult to imagine a setting more removed from the hurly burly of @entity72			0
situated at the foot of one of the most spectacular wooded escarpments in the @entity76 , and in striking distance of @entity78 and @entity79 , @entity17 stands in nearly one - and - a - half acres of landscaped grounds in the peaceful hamlet of @entity82 in the shadow of the village church – hence the house name			1
the @entity45 are now selling the property for £ 1.5 million to return to @entity87 , where they lived before moving to the @entity76 and where their children and grandchildren continue to live			2
@entity17 , which has five bedrooms and an attic room devoted to a model railway , originated from a group of three farm labourers ’ dwellings , the first being built in the late 1600s			2
iron bolthole : @entity1 visited @entity17 in her political heyday these were remodelled as one house in the @entity100 , which explains why the property has three staircases			1
the house has been evolving ever since			0
an extension was added at the back in @entity107 times , and with one owner buying a section of the road running into @entity18 , turning it into the property ’s rather grand private drive			2
‘ we feel we have the best of both worlds , ’ says @entity20			0
‘ there ’s the cosiness you get with the low ceilings and old beams of the 17th century rooms in the front and the larger @entity107 dimensions at the back			0
’ the @entity45 have also played their role in @entity17 ’s evolution , adding a large conservatory and indulging their love of gardening to transform its outside space into a magnificent plot with a @entity132 - style ‘ potager ’ vegetable and fruit garden			1
they have also restored a water feature at the front			0
despite @entity17 ’s location deep in the @entity76 countryside , @entity20 was attracted to the property because of its convenience for @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , which he would visit when he was chairman of the trustees of @entity45 from 2001 to 2006			1
he remains a vice-president and now serves in an ambassadorial role			0
he is the first family member since his great - grandfather ’s brother – dr @entity34 , who lived from 1845 to 1905 – to play a major role in the running of the charity			2
‘ when dr @entity34 died , the family were kept at a distance from the running of the charity but i always felt a connection with the founder because i , like him , trained at the @entity157 in @entity141 , ’ he says			0
@entity20 and @entity21 are part of the last surviving branch of the family bearing the @entity20 name and are proud that three of their five children are trained doctors , ensuring there will be more dr @entity45 in years to come			0
@entity167 , manager of @entity168 in @entity169 , which is handling the sale , says : ‘ @entity17 is ideal for growing families or for those with teenagers requiring their own space			2
it is also well suited for young retirees and for those looking to escape the city			0
