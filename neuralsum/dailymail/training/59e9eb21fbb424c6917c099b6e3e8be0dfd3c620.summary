by @entity0 published : 03:33 est , 21 september 2013 updated : 07:56 est , 21 september 2013 millionaires are often used to getting what they want			2
but it would appear that no matter how much they throw their wealth at estate agents in @entity9 , their millions are n't getting them much in these days of soaring house prices			1
estate agents are reporting that homes costing between £ 50million and £ 200million are extremely rare - despite people 's willingness to part with huge sums of cash			0
homes for the super rich are few and far between , as the capital 's house prices soar @entity20 , managing director of luxury estate agent @entity21 , said that the pool of mansions that both met clients ' demands and were within their budget had considerably shrunk , the @entity19 reported			1
investment firm @entity28 claims there have only been nine properties sold for more than £ 20m in @entity9 this year			1
however , these figures exclude those properties bought in the name of a company , a technique used by many overseas buyers , the @entity19 reported			0
as the @entity9 property market booms , the capital has been turned inside out over the past decade because the highly - paid are now choosing the gritty inner - city over once - affluent leafy suburbs			1
all change : this map from property experts show how areas of @entity9 have gone upmarket , in red , and downmarket , in blue , in the past decade based on the earnings and professions who live there a map compiled by housing experts shows that the 21st century capital has gone through ' reverse gentrification ' at a dramatic pace			1
based on the professions and salaries of those living there , the red areas show places that have gone ' upmarket ' and communities that have gone ' downmarket ' since 2001			0
experts from estate agency @entity65 used socio - economic data from the @entity67 and compared who lived where in 2001 and then in 2011 , the latest data available			0
it reveals the end of the trend where those who could not afford areas like @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and other salubrious areas of @entity9 headed to the outer edges of the city			1
the capital saw rises of almost 10 per cent in july , but prices fell in @entity85 , @entity86 and the north of @entity88			0
@entity9 's house prices are now double those in many areas , and rising faster the latest @entity92 showed values in @entity88 have now exceeded the peak in january 2008			1
but it is almost entirely fuelled by a sharp rise in prices in @entity9 and the @entity98			2
the @entity67 said that @entity100 house prices in july were 3.3 per cent higher than in 2012 , up from a 3.1 per cent rise in june			0
but when @entity9 and the @entity98 are removed , prices are only up 0.8 per cent			2
this surge in price has prompted fears last week , the @entity105 ( @entity105 ) suggested that a 5 per cent cap should be placed on annual house price growth to stop any future house price bubble and borrowers taking on too much debt for fear of missing out on a boom			0
' @entity92 price growth remains stable across most of the @entity100 , although prices in @entity9 are increasing faster than the @entity100 average , ' the @entity67 said			2
' the year - on - year increase reflected growth of 3.7 per cent in @entity88 and 1.8 per cent in @entity118 , offset by falls of 2 per cent in @entity85 and 0.7 per cent in @entity86			0
