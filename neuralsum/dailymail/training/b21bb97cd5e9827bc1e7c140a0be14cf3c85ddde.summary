by @entity0 published : 08:21 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 11:12 est , 9 august 2013 a judge has called the @entity3 ' crackers ' for pursuing a £ 7.49 criminal damage claim against a retired @entity6 captain			1
@entity7 , 55 , who is said to have sawn the top off a wooden fence post in a long - running dispute with neighbours @entity11 and @entity13 in @entity14 , near @entity15 , is due face trial next month			1
but district judge @entity17 said the decision to prosecute mr @entity7 was ' the height of nonsense ' and questioned whether the @entity3 was in touch with what mattered to the public in a time of austerity			1
district judge @entity17 , left , has described as ' the height of nonsense ' a court case over a £ 7.49 fence post row between @entity11 and @entity13 , pictured right , and their neighbour , retired @entity6 captain @entity7 sitting at @entity32 , the judge said : ' i can not believe - even given the vagaries of the @entity3 these days - that it wants to proceed with this case against a 55 - year - old man of exemplary character			1
the @entity3 really needs to get some sense of what is important to the public			0
' this is a dispute between neighbours			0
it was a fence post before he cut the top off it and it is still a fence post			2
' the neighbour is £ 7.49 out of pocket			0
it is the height of nonsense			0
' the @entity54 are believed to have filmed mr @entity7 chopping the top off the fence post with their cctv cameras			1
mr @entity7 said the case arose from a long - running dispute with his neighbour over rights of access and encroachment			1
he said : ' this is a matter of principle which i will not give way to			0
if i lose the case it could undermine a seriously expensive civil action			0
' take my employment away as well as leave me with a criminal record but the principle is something i will live with long after all this is over and i want to be able to live comfortably with my conscience if i have nothing else in the world			0
' prosecutor @entity80 said it was impossible to prove whose land the fence post was on , and said it was felt mr @entity7 had to be prosecuted because of a chance of further trouble			1
a cctv still showing @entity7 chopping the top off the fence post - he argues it is on his property the fence post , seen here in the centre of the picture with wires coming out of it , is at the centre of the case she said the boundary dispute was due to be sorted out at county court			1
' a way out of this would have been to offer captain @entity7 the chance to be bound over to keep the peace			0
' i understand he will not accept a binding over because he says he was in his rights to cut the top off the post			2
we will have to list it for trial			0
' @entity114 , for mr @entity7 , said he believed he was within his legal rights to cut off the top of the post because it was on his land and he claimed it contravened planning regulations			1
neighbours ' dispute : the post lies between the @entity54 ' home , left , and mr @entity7 's house , on the right the @entity54 are said to have been involved in a long - running dispute with their neighbour in the @entity131 village now @entity133 mp @entity132 has waded into the row , saying the @entity3 needed to clarify the issue to assure the public that the correct decision had been made to prosecute			1
he said : ' given the current pressures on the public purse and the comments made by the judge , it is right that questions are asked about the wisdom of pursuing a case of this nature which has presumably come at significant expense to the taxpayer			0
' mr @entity7 was granted unconditional bail until the trial on september 12			2
a @entity3 spokesman said following the judge ’s comments they would reassess the case before proceeding with the prosecution			2
he said : ' we are aware of concerns raised by district judge @entity17			2
this is a matter which was charged by the police and we await a full file from them at which point the matter will be further reviewed			0
