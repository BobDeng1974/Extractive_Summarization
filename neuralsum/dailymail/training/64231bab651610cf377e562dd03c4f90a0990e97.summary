with its walls left to crumble , and ivy winding its way through grandiose halls and staircases , it 's easy to imagine how @entity7 might have fallen into disrepair because of a lack of funds for its upkeep			1
however , the @entity14 stately home 's troubles run far deeper than that			1
right from its first owner - lord overstone - it has been a resolutely unloved place and , since a fire ravaged the upper floors a decade ago , it has been up for sale for a mere £ 1million but without any interest			1
@entity34 commissioned the @entity36 and @entity37 style building in 1860 , but did n't live to see it finished			1
unfortunately her husband @entity17 hated the design , built by architect @entity41 , and even declared his contempt in a letter to friends			0
' the new house , i regret to say , is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation , ' wrote lord @entity17			0
' it is an utter failure , although very large and full of pretension - it has neither taste , comfort nor convenience			0
i am utterly ashamed of it			0
' lord @entity17 despised it so much that he refused to live in it for the remainder of his life , leaving it to his daughter @entity63 on his death in 1883			0
the lounge inside @entity66 in the 1920s when it was owned by sir @entity68 who used it as a training base for @entity72 members sir @entity68 who wanted to turn it into a training base for the @entity72 disliked the imposing building and condemned his scheme as an ' abject failure ' in 1928 , before it was sold to the @entity78 lord @entity17 ( left ) declared that he did not like the mansion his wife had designed and gave it to his daughter @entity82 ( right ) on his death in 1883 @entity34 commissioned the @entity84 hodgepodge of @entity36 and @entity37 architectural style in 1860 , but did n't live to see it finished the mansion has now fallen into disrepair and has been reclaimed by nature with ivy and foliage growing through all the rooms in the house a fire ripped through the top floor destroying 60 per cent of the property in april 2001 , including all of the principal rooms and the impressive carved staircase @entity98 also spent minimal time at the property , only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties , so it was sold in 1920 in 1979 the school closed and was sold privately for £ 701,000 and used by the @entity104 as its @entity106 headquarters @entity98 also spent minimal time at the property , only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties			1
after she died in 1920 , the property was sold to sir @entity68 who intended to use it as a training base for conservative party members			0
however he condemned the scheme as an ' abject failure ' in 1928			0
it was privately sold to @entity78 in 1929 where part of the massive building was run as a girls ' boarding school			2
lord @entity17 hated the house so much that he refused to live there , saying : ' it is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation ' the property was listed in 2010 for £ 1million but the property did n't sell and is still owned by the @entity104 , which is asking for the same price lord @entity17 's daughter , @entity130 , inherited the house after his death @entity133 was acquired by @entity134 , father of @entity17 , 1st @entity17 , for £ 117,500 in 1832			1
on the death of @entity134 in 1858 , the house and 10,000 acres of land became lord @entity17 ’s property			2
the banker and politician had married @entity130 , daughter of conservative politician @entity141 , in 1829			0
together they had one son , who died as an infant , and a daughter @entity130 @entity145 in 1829			0
in 1860 @entity34 decided to engage the architect @entity41 to replace the existing house with something more in keeping with their taste			1
she was keen to have a property fitting with their status and so her husband decided to rebuild on a grand scale			0
but she commissioned a design with a mixture of @entity36 and @entity37 features which led to one of the most derided houses created in the @entity84 era			1
@entity34 died before the house was completed in november 1864 and left her husband a widower			1
he hated the house and remarked in a letter to a friend : ' @entity170 , i regret to say , is a cause of unmitigated disappointment and vexation			0
it is an utter failure although very large and full of pretension , it has neither taste , comfort , nor convenience			0
' he refused to live there in his later years and left the house and extensive fortune to his daughter @entity130 on his death in 1883 , one of the most revered heiresses of her time , she was a noted philanthropist , and greatly interested in hospital and nursing work			0
in november 1858 she married @entity190 , who assumed the name of @entity192 by deed poll			0
early on , they became the owners of two fine country places - @entity133 , @entity197 , and @entity198 , @entity199 , where the couple chiefly resided			2
she only used the @entity34 estate occasionally for winter hunting parties , as her main home was in @entity204			1
with her husband , a former distinguished soldier and @entity208 hero , she was instrumental in establishing the @entity209 , which was really the forerunner of the @entity106 @entity210			0
photographer @entity211 , 25 , who entered the property described his experience as surreal and haunting , saying it has been reclaimed by nature lord @entity17 despised the house so much that he refused to live in it for the remainder of his life , leaving it to his daughter @entity63 on his death in 1883 in 1979 the school closed and was sold privately for £ 701,000 and used by the @entity104 as its @entity106 headquarters			1
a fire ripped through the top floor in april 2001 , destroying 60 per cent of the property including all of the principal rooms and the impressive carved staircase			1
photographer @entity211 , 25 , who entered the property described his experience as surreal and haunting			1
he said : ' i 've never been to anywhere like it , it is such an enormous , imposing house that has been reclaimed by nature			2
' i can understand why it was never wanted by any of its owners , the main tower looks distinctly unfriendly			2
it 's hard to judge the interior because there 's so little of it left but the few rooms that did remain were far too big and drafty			2
' it was totally surreal being there and i did feel on edge because of the constants noises and flutterings , i actually had to remind myself that i do n't believe in ghosts			2
' the property was listed in 2010 for £ 1million but the property did n't sell and is still owned by the @entity104			1
a buyer is presently being sought			0
it was privately sold to @entity78 in 1929 where part of the massive building was ran as a girls ' boarding school the property is still owned by the @entity104 and the organisation is hoping it will sell for more than £ 1million @entity259 and creepers have started growing through the windows and up the walls of the stately home in @entity14 since the fire in 2001			1
