by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:43 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 20:20 est , 26 february 2013 police failed to investigate a rape by @entity4 who went on to kill his own children by cutting their throats as they lay in bed rape victims were pressured into withdrawing their allegations to help police meet crime targets , a damning report revealed yesterday			1
detectives from @entity15 ’s specialist rape unit persuaded the women to say the attacks they endured were ‘ consensual sex ’			1
in one case , a detective sergeant pressured a woman to drop a rape claim against retired security guard @entity4 , 63 , who then went on to murder his two children in their beds with a carving knife			1
the shocking treatment was revealed in a report by the @entity28 into the @entity30 branch of @entity15 ’s @entity32 unit , which investigates rape and sexual assault			1
the police watchdog found detectives had adopted an approach of ‘ failing to believe ’ victims and , in a breach of the ‘ first principle ’ of @entity15 ’s rules , had failed to investigate cases properly			0
if they could persuade victims to say the attacks were consensual sex , officers could then write the allegations off as ‘ no crime ’ incidents to reduce the number of unsolved cases on their books and meet official crime detection targets			1
@entity53 , deputy chairman of the @entity28 , said the failings were ‘ deeply disturbing ’ , and accused officers of losing sight of their role			1
she also warned that the @entity59 ’s usual claim of having learnt from earlier failures ‘ begins to ring hollow ’			2
she said : ‘ the report brings to an end the @entity28 ’s involvement in this sorry chapter of the @entity32 unit ’s history			1
@entity67 , 10 , ( left ) and @entity68 , 8 , ( right ) were murdered by their father when they went to stay with him ‘ the approach of failing to believe victims in the first instance was wholly inappropriate			1
‘ the pressure to meet targets as a measure of success , rather than focusing on the outcome for the victim , resulted in the police losing sight of what policing is about – protecting the public and deterring and detecting crime			0
’ the @entity28 ’s report examined the practices of the @entity30 squad between july 2008 and september 2009			1
it found that the squad was ‘ underperforming and overstretched ’ during that period			0
it also discovered that victims were closely questioned by a detective constable before talking to a specialist officer			0
@entity15 failed to hold gross misconduct proceedings against three officers accused of failings in the investigation into serial sex offender @entity97 , it emerged today			2
@entity53 from the @entity28 said it was ' enormously frustrating ' that action had not been taken			2
the @entity28 recommended that a superintendent and two inspectors should face gross misconduct proceedings			2
ms @entity53 said : ' they need to demonstrate to the people of @entity104 that they are taking this seriously and they are holding officers to account			1
' she wrote to the @entity59 in june 2010 to complain about ' the unhappy litany of delay and prevarication ' in taking action , but received no reply			2
the superintendent , who is now a chief superintendent , was given ' words of advice ' , through an internal management procedure			0
the detective chief inspector , who is now a superintendent , was given a written warning , as was the detective inspector , who remains at the same rank			0
football coach @entity97 was found guilty of stalking and preying on 25 women over 12 years in the @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 areas of south west @entity104			2
it emerged during his trial that police did not arrest him until four years after he was first named as a suspect and a separate @entity28 inquiry was carried out into apparent blunders and failings			0
this meant they were questioned repeatedly , going against standard practice which says a victim should be believed in the first instance until evidence shows otherwise			0
ms @entity53 continued : ' the findings of our investigation into the rape reported in november 2008 were also deeply disturbing			1
the victim was failed by the people from whom she had sought help			0
' since 2009 , when the unit came under central command , @entity32 has changed considerably and continues to evolve			0
' but given the number of cases where the @entity59 's response to victims has failed , either through individual officers ’ criminality or neglect or more systemic problems of training , priorities and resources , the response that " lessons have been learned " begins to ring hollow			1
' that is why i asked representatives of those who actually deal with victims to advise me of their experience of whether lessons have indeed been learned and i am very grateful to those who attended a meeting at the @entity28 in december 2012 for sharing their expertise			2
' it is encouraging that this experience has , for the most part , improved considerably , though there is still more to be done			0
' the mps have recently reconstituted their external reference group and it is their responsibility to maintain this vital link – which if properly used will provide them with an early warning system against potential future problems before they become headlines			0
' the @entity59 must now ensure that this improvement is built on and continues – and remain vigilant to ensure that they do not lose focus on this area as other policing priorities emerge , or as they face further pressure on resources			0
' the @entity59 ’s @entity32 unit is supposed to set the ‘ gold standard ’ for rape investigations across the country			1
but the @entity28 report into the latest failings is the ninth investigation into @entity32 and the fifth relating to @entity30			0
nineteen officers from across @entity104 have been disciplined , including three who have been sacked			1
a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ we have for some time acknowledged that previous investigation of rape and serious sexual assault [ in the @entity59 ] was below standard			2
‘ the activities identified in this report came during that era and highlight specific issues within @entity30 which resulted in unacceptable actions by local officers			0
‘ it is as a result of such failings that we have made substantial changes to the investigation of rape and serious sexual assault			0
’ the @entity59 has previously been criticised for failures over serial sex offender taxi driver @entity218 ( left ) while @entity221 @entity220 ( right ) was jailed for 16 months for failing to investigate rape claims			1
