it is set to be the first advert on the moon - and the first time a soft drink can has been abandoned on the lunar surface			2
the @entity6 makers of the @entity8 drink today announced plans to send a specially designed can made of titanium and engraved with messages to the lunar surface in 2015			1
the handwritten messages , gathered from @entity6 children and internet users , will be stored as data in 120 titanium plates to be packaged in the lander , called a ' dream capsule '			1
the can will launch on a @entity27 , designed to be a potentially reusable means of space travel by @entity31 's @entity30			2
after the @entity27 rocket has ignited its second - stage boosters and completed a four - and - a - half day journey to the moon , the @entity8 - branded canister will be deposited on the surface by private company @entity40 's ' @entity39 ' lander			1
the firm is developing the lander ( above ) to try and win @entity44 's $ 20 - million prize for the first company to land a device on the moon that can both travel 500 meters on the surface and transmit high - definition pictures back to @entity50			0
@entity51 said the capsule will launch from @entity53 in october 2015			1
' until now , the space travel was only possible at a national project level , ' the firm said			0
' now , we want to realize it privately and get to the moon			0
' the capsule to be delivered to the moon is made out of titanium , shaped like a @entity8 sweat can , and weighs 1,000g			1
to continuously endure the harsh environment of the moon where the temperature shifts from minus 170 ℃ at night to 110 ℃ during the day , the capsule was developed specifically for this project			0
the capsule will be conveyed to the moon by the falcon 9 rocket during a four and a half day journey			0
how it works : messages will be included alongside a powdered form of the drink the @entity27 9 , designed to be a potentially reusable means of space travel by @entity31 's @entity30 , has already made three successful supply runs to the @entity80			1
however , the planned mission in october 2015 would be the first time one of its rockets has successfully provided propulsion to the moon			1
after the @entity27 rocket has ignited its second - stage boosters and completed a four - and - a - half day journey to the moon , the @entity8 - branded canister will be deposited on the surface by private company @entity40 's ' @entity39 ' lander			2
the @entity27 @entity30 rocket lifts off from space launch complex 40 at the @entity96 in @entity96 , @entity97			0
the @entity27 9 , designed to be a potentially reusable means of space travel by @entity31 's @entity30 , has already made three successful supply runs to the @entity80 and will be used as part of the new project			2
the company hopes the missiopn could help it win @entity44 's @entity103 , a $ 20 - million bounty for the first company to land a device on the moon that can both travel 500 meters on the surface and transmit high - definition pictures back to @entity50			0
@entity40 's deal with @entity51 will provide them with funds to achieve this goal — the company reportedly charges upwards of half a million dollars for lunar delivery .			0
