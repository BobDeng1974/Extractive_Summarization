instead – despite facing limited social embarrassment – they were still on the ‘ best golf courses ’			1
speaking in @entity14 , mr @entity6 said : ‘ the individuals who ran the institutions got away with it			1

but mr @entity6 said such rules were necessary because the heads of banks during the crisis had got away with huge amounts of money without criminal sanction			1
he made it clear he rejected the complaints of the @entity47 board members without naming the pair or specifically referring to their bank			1
while it was difficult to come up with acceptable compensation schemes and incentives , he said one thing that was vital to make the system safer was clearer personal responsibility			2
curtailing financial rewards alone was not enough			1
two senior @entity47 executives are poised to quit their jobs over tough new rules on ' reckless ' bank actions he said : ‘ if you are the chairman or the head of the risk committee , you have a responsibility for the activities of that institution			2
‘ if you do n’t think you can do it , you should n’t be on the board			2
’ the new regulation regime of senior managers is designed to make it easier to bring criminal charges in a future banking crisis			1
mr @entity6 added : ‘ it does focus the mind of directors and it should			1
i would like to think that the minds of directors are being focused			2
some of them might not like it – that ’s okay			2
’ it emerged last week that two @entity47 executives are preparing to leave the bank amid concerns over the potential personal and criminal responsibility they would face in future			2

they also benefit from share payouts of around £ 2million			0
@entity150 from the @entity152 think - tank said : ‘ there ’s a huge gap opening up			0

@entity169 , its deputy chairman , is also preparing to resign			0
mr @entity6 has always taken a tough stance on personal responsibility and has a history of standing firm in the face of complaints from financial sector employees			1
meanwhile , the taxman has ramped up prosecutions against individuals suspected of tax dodging – but is still accused of letting corporate giants off the hook			0
the number of court cases @entity186 brought for illegal tax evasion rose last year by almost a third – from 612 to 795 – data from @entity190 shows today			0
it is not yet known how many were successful			0
but it is claimed the taxman has done deals with @entity195 that allow it to avoid paying millions in the @entity111 .			0
