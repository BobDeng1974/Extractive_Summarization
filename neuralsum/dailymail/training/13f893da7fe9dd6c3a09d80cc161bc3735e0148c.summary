@entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 in @entity3 and @entity4 in @entity5 – choosing the right dress for the @entity7 is almost as important to @entity9 nominees as the award itself			1
and now , thanks to a clever graphic from a @entity16 digital media agency , you can see every single winning actress ’s gown on one picture			1
@entity21 digital has created an ‘ infographic ’ of every winning dress worn on the red carpet and to collect their @entity22 , since the very first @entity7 ceremony in 1929			2
the first dress worn was by @entity45 in 1929 for her performances in three films : @entity48 ( 1927 ) , @entity49 : a @entity50 ( 1927 ) and @entity51 ( 1928 )			0
this was the only occasion on which an actress has won one @entity7 for multiple film roles			0
unlike today ’s fierce competition to wear the biggest designer name , @entity45 ’s simple knee - length skirt and grey top was ‘ off the rack , ’ and not created by a designer name at all			2
@entity62 wins : worn by @entity63 in 1990 , @entity64 in 1992 and @entity65 in 1993 @entity66 – two wins : worn by @entity67 in 2006 and @entity68 in 2013 @entity69 – two wins : @entity70 in 1972 and @entity71 in 2009 @entity72 – two wins : @entity73 in 1999 and @entity74 in 2004 @entity75 – two wins : @entity76 in 2003 and @entity77 in 2008 the last dress drawn on the graphic is last year ’s sweeping @entity66 strapless gown worn by @entity68			1
the actress won @entity9 for her turn in @entity83			0
@entity84 is up for the @entity86 accolade this year , for her role in @entity89 doubt , as the face of @entity66 , she will wear another gown from the @entity93 fashion house			1
@entity66 has been the designer of choice for twowining actresses throughout the @entity7 ’s history ; @entity67 also wore a dress by the designer in 2006 , when she won the award for her portrayal as @entity101 in @entity102			1
but the designer with the most red carpet wins over the years has been @entity105 , as the @entity107 fashion powerhouse has dressed three @entity7 - winning lead actresses ; @entity63 in 1990 for @entity109 , @entity64 in 1992 for @entity110 and @entity65 in 1993 for @entity111			2
the cute picture also lists the 16 occasions in which the winning actress did not appear at the ceremony to collect her award			0
@entity117 won @entity9 in a @entity118 in 1934 , 1968 , 1969 and 1982 , but did n’t attend the awards on either occasion			0
@entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 also chose not to collect their @entity7 for @entity9 .			0

@entity16 media agency @entity29 has drawn each of the 67 dresses
from @entity45 **'s** ' off the rack ' to @entity68 **'s** 2013 @entity66 gown
@entity132 says they *wanted* to ' *explore* the fashion aspect of the @entity7 '
