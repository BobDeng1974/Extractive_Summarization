he left the field to an ovation fit for a hero			2
@entity4 had his first goal for @entity6 and it proved to be decisive in clinching victory over @entity8 at @entity9			1
it also obscured the fact that a player who could end up costing @entity6 in excess of £ 50million had squandered a number of opportunities to get off the mark earlier in the game			2
alongside him , @entity18 posed even less of a threat			0
neither striker , it has to be said , is living up to his reputation at the moment			0
@entity4 connects from inside the box to score his first @entity6 goal the @entity6 striker pokes him against @entity8 after @entity28 's mishit shot broke to him in the box @entity4 and @entity18 have a good statistical record up front together but never seemed to click the statistics will show that either @entity4 and @entity32 have been on the scoresheet in all three games they have started together			1
indeed , @entity32 ’s first of the season at @entity38 was presented to him on a plate by @entity4 ’s far post cross			1
unfortunately for @entity6 , it ended there			0
since then , this has looked less like a strike partnership and more like two forwards struggling side by side for top form ; proof that the fantasy football approach of throwing together two big - name players does not guarantee instant success			2
there is no clever interplay , no obvious understanding , and no running off one another			0
thank goodness @entity6 have @entity28 to pull it altogether			1
@entity18 picked up an early booking for a late tackle on @entity8 's @entity59 @entity4 has still not completed 90 minutes for @entity6 since joining on loan on transfer deadline day in fairness to @entity4 and @entity32 , both are working their way back from knee injuries			1
in @entity4 ’s case , he has yet to complete a full 90 minutes since rupturing the acl in his left knee playing for @entity69 in a @entity71 tie in january , forcing him to miss the @entity72			1
@entity32 made it to @entity74 with @entity75 after suffering a knee injury playing for @entity6 against @entity78 last season , but he has not looked like the same player since			1
he had just one chance of note against @entity8 , latching onto to @entity83 ’s first - time flick early in the game but steered the ball high over @entity87 ’s goal			0
@entity4 , on the other hand , could have had a hat - trick			1
click here to see our brilliant @entity91 including @entity4 's match - winning heat map @entity4 was barely involved in @entity6 's build - up play but did his most important work in the @entity8 box @entity18 spent more time on the ball for @entity6 but in less dangerous positions @entity4 contributed little aside from goals , but his strike proved to be the all - important winner inside the opening 20 minutes alone , he met @entity105 ’s excellent cross with a diving header which failed to beat @entity87 , and then volleyed well wide after being played in by @entity83 ’s flick			1
the former @entity109 and @entity110 striker then met @entity83 ’s corner on the full just before half - time and succeeded only in volleying it high into the @entity114			0
it was the attempt of a player increasingly desperate to break his duck			0
he had two more half chances within two minutes of the restart and then snatched at another close - range effort when @entity105 picked him out in the box again			0
but a player with @entity4 ’s remarkable goalscoring record will always be a threat			1
‘ a proper centre - forward , ’ said @entity127 on television			0
@entity32 was in the game more throughout but less likely to arrive on the end of a move than his partner @entity4 found it difficult to escape the attentions of @entity136 and @entity137 but did get chances the @entity140 striker fires wide while his strike partner looks on hoping for a pass when @entity83 for once mis - hit a shot in the 62nd minute , his teammate had dropped off his markers and was lurking to stab the ball past @entity87 from 10 yards			1
the relief on @entity4 ’s face was clear to see			2
instead of making a rather awkward exit 11 minutes later , @entity9 gave him a rousing ovation when he was replaced by @entity151			0
‘ he needed that goal , ’ said @entity152 afterwards			0
‘ i have talked with him because i thought he was forcing himself too much to score a goal			0
@entity4 was beginning to look frustrated as he failed to take his chances before he finally found the net @entity4 may be more used to his role in the opponent 's area , but he performed a crucial role on his own line it was clear how much @entity4 's goal meant , both to the player himself and the @entity6 fans ‘ he ’s a player who will normally make a goal every match and he has had to wait so long			1
i can understand that but now he has scored it will be better after the international break			2
’ @entity6 must hope their manager is right			0
continuing to play @entity4 and @entity32 together will mean dropping @entity175 into his less preferred midfield role and fewer opportunities for @entity178			1
the two stars leading the line must produce , both individually and as a partnership , to make it all worthwhile			2
@entity152 congratulates his expensive striker whose goal secured a vital three points for @entity6			0

@entity4 and @entity32 have scored between them in each of the games they have started together
but pair showing little *attacking* *cohesion* as a partnership
@entity4 scores from @entity28 's misshit shot but could have had a *hattrick*
