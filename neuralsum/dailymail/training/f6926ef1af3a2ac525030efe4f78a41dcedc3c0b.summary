by @entity0 @entity1 is to meet data regulators across the @entity3 to discuss the way it handled the @entity3 's ' right to be forgotten ruling '			1
in may the @entity8 ruled that links to ' irrelevant ' or outdated articles should be erased from search engine results if those mentioned in the articles request their removal			2
that verdict , along with @entity1 's decision to apply the practice only to its @entity19 search engines , has pitted privacy advocates against freedom of speech defenders , who argue the process will be abused in order to cover up information that should remain easily accessible to the public			1
debate : regulators can take @entity1 to court if it refuses to delete articles they consider ' irrelevant ' or outdated , as happened in @entity32 where the ' right to be forgotten ' ruling originated @entity19 data protection authorities are meeting representatives of @entity1 , @entity36 and @entity37 to discuss the implementation of the landmark ruling			1
@entity3 privacy watchdogs have reportedly raised a number of concerns about the way the ruling is being implemented , particularly by @entity1			0
regulators can take @entity1 to court if it refuses to meet their demands , as happened in @entity32 where the ' right to be forgotten ' ruling originated			2
under particular scrutiny is @entity1 's decision to only remove results from its @entity19 search engines - such as @entity53 - meaning anyone can easily access the hidden information by switching to the widely used @entity53			1
experts have said this effectively defeats the purpose of the ruling , which gives people the right to ask search engines to stop links to information deemed ' inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant , or excessive ' from appearing in searches for their name			1
' @entity1 has claimed that the decision is restricted to localised versions of @entity1 ... there appears to be no basis for that claim at all ' said @entity71 , a partner at @entity72 , a law firm			0
@entity1 declined to comment ahead of today 's meeting			0
browsing : freedom of speech defenders argue ' right to be forgotten ' will be abused in order to cover up information about individuals that should remain easily accessible to the public via search engines another issue likely to be raised by the @entity3 watchdogs is @entity1 's decision to notify the owners of the websites that have been removed from search results			1
this sparked controversy three weeks ago when @entity19 's most popular search engine removed links to an article by a well - known @entity94 journalist about an @entity96 banker , and several links to stories in a @entity100 newspaper			2
the authors of the stories wrote about the removal , thereby drawing attention to the issue and feeding speculation about who requested the removal			0
@entity1 eventually reinstated a few of the links			0
@entity3 privacy watchdogs are concerned about the effect the notification process could have on people making the requests			0
@entity1 already notifies the owners of websites that are removed from search results due to copyright infringements			2
privacy advocates and legal experts said the backlash over the aforementioned articles showed the difficulty of implementing the privacy ruling given the broad criteria laid down by the court for information that is inadequate or irrelevant			1
' we are likely to see complainants dressing up libel complaints as data protection complaints as it is easier to prove that data is inaccurate than it is to prove that it is libelous , ' @entity71 said			0
' this will lead to some difficult decisions for @entity1 , ' he added .			0

@entity1 has been accused of *mishandling* @entity8 ruling
verdict says links to ' irrelevant ' articles must be deleted from search results
but @entity1 has only applied the ruling to its @entity19 search engines
@entity53 still displays the full results - *angering* some privacy advocates
but freedom of speech defenders argue ' right to be forgotten ' can be abused to cover up information that should remain easily accessible
data regulators are now meeting search engines to discuss the @entity8 ruling
