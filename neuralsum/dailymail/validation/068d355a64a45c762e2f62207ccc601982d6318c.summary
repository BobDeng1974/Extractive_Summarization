a mother and her daughter who both have a rare condition which makes their skin wrinkle prematurely have undergone matching £ 50,000 facelifts			1
@entity7 , 45 , and her daughter @entity8 , 18 , both suffer @entity9 , a rare condition which makes fat dissolve beneath tissue			1
while @entity8 had a face - lift at the age of 16 to stave off bullies , her mother has long suffered lingering stares and cruel nicknames			1
having been rejected by the @entity19 for a free operation , the mother of seven thought she would be forever trapped in a sinking face			1
but , two years since her daughter received free surgery from @entity25 doctors , the 45 - year - old has unveiled her new £ 50,000 face after being flown overseas to receive the same vip treatment			1
both women have suffered at the taunts of bullies who made fun of the rare condition which sees their skin wrinkle prematurely after : the mother daughter duo were treated to free surgery by doctors in @entity25 after being turned down by the @entity19 speaking of the treatment - a face and neck lift plus @entity48 injections - mrs @entity7 , who was constantly teased as a child , says she has never felt better			1
' my face is worth £ 50,000 and it feels absolutely amazing when i get up in the morning , ' she said			1
' i ’ve been called a " granny " and a " monkey " all my life and when i look at old pictures now i think i looked like the dragon off @entity54			0
' but now i ’ve got a new lease of life and i can hold my head high when i walk down the street			0
i think i look pretty good now and totally different			0
' mrs @entity7 , who lives off disability allowance , has been plagued with low self - esteem her entire life because of the condition			2
while lipodystrophy can occur as a side effect of various illnesses , a small number of people in the world are born with the condition			0
the results can vary between sufferers			0
in mrs @entity7 's case her face , neck and arms were the worst affected making her look double her age at times			2
now the pair say they enjoy better self - esteem and higher levels of confidence despite being turned down by the @entity19 the pair ( left , after the procedure and right , in 2011 ) are among a handful of people afflicted with @entity9 in the @entity91 @entity8 ( pictured aged seven ) was born with the condition and teased at school			1
when she was 16 she was contacted by surgeons in @entity25 who offered to perform a facelift free of charge three of mrs @entity7 's seven children were born with the condition though @entity8 ( left ) was the worst afflicted			1
they are pictured above with her daughter @entity100 who also has @entity9 , in 2012 mrs @entity7 , who has been married three times , said that for the fist time in years she is being chatted up by men			1
she is pictured three years ago aged 42 with her husband @entity104 and daughters @entity100 and @entity8 @entity9 affects its sufferers differently , with fat loss occurring in different parts of the body			1
mrs @entity7 , for example , has more pronounced wrinkles in her arms , neck and face			1
above , she poses with @entity8 ( right ) before her procedure , and daughter @entity116 , who does not have the condition ' i ’ve been ridiculed my entire life and endured all sorts of cruel names since school , ' she said			2
' i ’ve had to put up with so much			0
i was never able to get a job and it does make you resentful sometimes			0
' of @entity7 ’s seven children , three have inherited the rare condition			1
@entity100 , 25 and @entity128 , 26 , are also sufferers though @entity8 's symptoms were most prominent			2

@entity9 also known as the ‘ @entity135 ’ , refers to a number of disturbances in the way the body uses and distributes fat			2
one of the most common symptoms is fat loss in the face , causing sufferers to appear gaunt and wrinkled far earlier than their peers			2
while it is a common side effect of illnesses such as diabetes , a small number of people are born with the condition			0
the dissolving of fat beneath tissue can occur in different body parts in every patient			1
some will look haggered in the face and thin in the arms while others will see rushes of fat to the hips and legs			0
the pair stayed in touch and , after watching her daughter 's skin improve , the doctor offered mrs @entity7 , who had already been rejected by the @entity19 , the same treatment			1
' i got turned down in this country because they said it was just cosmetic and as you can imagine i was absolutely fuming , ' she said			0
' i think it ’s disgusting that i was born with this condition and the @entity19 wo n’t do anything about it			2
' i do n’t know how they could refuse me - my face looked terrible			0
' and while she was delighted with the facelift and subsequent @entity48 injections , the 45 - year - old stopped short of transforming her whole face			1
' they asked me if i wanted @entity185 lips but i think that would be taking it a bit too far			0
' it was never about looking younger , it was just about having a normal face that i could be happy with and stand to look at in the mirror			0
' i love putting my make - up on now and making the most of my new face			0
i never bothered with anything like that before but now i have a bag full of cosmetics			0
' ' i feel like i ’m having the last laugh now at everyone who called me names and it ’s a massive boost			0
