just as chancellor @entity1 ratcheted up company car tax for thousands of motorists , @entity5 giant @entity4 unveiled its new ' budget buster ' — its first mainstream plug - in petrol - electric hybrid suv			1
the ' green ' @entity9 can be recharged at home , can run on electric power only and switches constantly between petrol and electric power while on the move			0
it 'll help keep company car tax far lower than for a conventionally fuelled version			1
the two - litre petrol engine and the 113bhp electric drive together generate 313bhp of pulling power			0
the new ' green ' @entity9 ( pictured ) can be charged at home , can run on electric power only and switches constantly between petrol and electric power while on the move it has a top speed of 131 mph , will sprint to 62mph in 6.8 seconds and will be launched at next month 's @entity29			1
average fuel consumption of up to 85 mpg and co2 emissions — on which company car tax and road tax are based — are a low 77g/km			1
@entity4 says : ' short , everyday journeys in urban areas can easily be completed with zero exhaust emissions , while actual fuel consumption is reduced substantially when driving for distances of up to approximately 15 miles in urban traffic			1
' driving in this way equates to an equivalent 94.2mpg			0
' however , the budget measures also mean most company car drivers will be thousands of pounds worse off			1
there will be a 3 percentage point hike in the tax in 2019 - 20			1
it means a higherrate taxpayer with a £ 28,000 @entity52 1.6 - litre company car will be £ 1,008 worse off after just five years with a total annual benefit - in - kind tax bill of £ 3,360			1
city accountant @entity54 says the hikes are unfair on company car drivers locked into three or four - year deals who ' in good faith ' chose a frugal model , only to find it re-classified just a couple of years later as ' a gas - guzzler ' , and taxed accordingly			1
they are the chilling words most likely to strike horror into the heart of any long - suffering person whose car - nut partner has time on their hands : ' i quite fancy doing a car restoration project			1
' the presenters behind @entity77 tv show @entity75 have picked out their top five restorations in a new manual ( pictured ) so if you ca n't face the reality , why not present your other half with a new book about the subject to keep them distracted ? the presenters behind the @entity77 's hit tv show @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , have picked their top five restorations			1
it marks the release of the new @entity94 ( pictured below — @entity95 , £ 22.99 ) and the new series starting on monday			0
the manual goes behind the scenes to reflect on ten of the most popular restorations from the first 12 years of the show			0
the cars featured are : @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , and the @entity111			2
of the @entity113 restoration , @entity90 says : ' the @entity113 is definitely one of my all - time favourite classics , and is just such good fun to drive			0
if you want a small classic that 'll be easy to work on , this is the car for you ; and there 's a great owners ' scene , so you 'll never be stuck for help or advice			1
' ? cars made here are becoming even more @entity128 as the amount of parts deployed that are made in the @entity128 has risen by a fifth			2
domestic parts makers sold 19 per cent more components to @entity128 - based manufacturers last year than in 2013 , say new figures from the @entity137			0
but the ' @entity138 ' of cars manufactured here is still far less than 40 years ago			2
the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) says around a third of the components in a @entity128 - built car are sourced domestically , compared to more than 90 per cent in the mid-seventies			2
think of @entity111 and you think of @entity145			0
but maybe not for much longer			0
for the new @entity147 scores a few considerable firsts , not least being built in @entity149			0
@entity151 's debut in the small suv market features a nine - speed gearbox , along with a 7in full - colour multi-view display			1
it is also the first car from @entity157 to be jointly developed by @entity149 and @entity145 engineers			2
the new @entity147 was built in @entity149 and features a nine - speed gearbox , along with a 7in full - colour multi-view display as such it is also the first jeep to be built in @entity163 , but sold in the @entity145 it also features a ' my @entity166 ' sunroof that gives occupants a true open - air driving experience			2
@entity151 , now along with @entity171 owned by @entity157 , says that although built in @entity149 , the @entity172 had to be instantly recognisable as a jeep			0
it 'll be sold in 100 markets globally			0
designers were challenged to come up with a look that would symbolise @entity111 's @entity145 heritage while appealing to youthful , adventurous buyers			2
the result is rugged yet chic , and preserves classic styling cues such as the seven - slot grille , round headlamps and straight - line wheel arches			0
its two petrol engines are the 110hp 1.6 - litre @entity188 unit , and a 1.4 - litre @entity190 turbo , which comes with power outputs of 140 and 170hp .			0
