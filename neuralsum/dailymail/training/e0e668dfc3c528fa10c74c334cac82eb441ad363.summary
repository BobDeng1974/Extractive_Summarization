a chemical compound found in spicy curries could help reduce the risk of developing bowel cancer , a study has found			1
researchers gave capsaicin , which gives chilli peppers their heat , to mice genetically prone to developing multiple tumours in their gastrointestinal tract			1
the capsaicin triggered a pain receptor in the cells lining their intestines , setting off a reaction that reduced the risk of growing colorectal tumours			1
and it was even more effective when combined with celecoxib , an anti-inflammatory drug already approved for treating some forms of arthritis			0
bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the @entity36 , with doctors diagnosing an average of 41,000 new cases of the disease every year			1
the study , published in @entity42 , recommended that patients at risk of getting colon or rectal cancers should be given capsaicin as part of their diet to inhibit tumour growth			2
capsaicin is already used as an analgesic in topical ointments , where it acts as an irritant overwhelming nerves reducing their ability to report pain for extended periods of time			2
it is also used in pepper spray			0
the receptor or ion channel that is triggered by the capsicin - called @entity65 - was originally discovered in sensory neurons reacting to heat , acidity and spicy chemicals in the environment			1
the study , published in @entity42 , recommended that patients at risk of getting colon cancer , pictured , or rectal cancer should be given capsaicin as part of their diet to inhibit tumour growth but the study found @entity75 was also expressed by epithelial cells in the lining of the intestines , where it is activated by epidermal growth factor receptor or @entity81			1
@entity81 was an important driver of cell proliferation in the intestines , whose epithelial lining is replaced approximately every four to six days			0
dr @entity85 added : ' a basic level of @entity81 activity is required to maintain the normal cell turnover in the gut			0
however , if @entity81 signaling is left unrestrained , the risk of sporadic tumor development increases			0
' they found that mice genetically modified to be trpv1 - deficient suffered higher - than - normal rates of intestinal tumour growths			2
dr @entity85 added : ' these results showed us that epithelial @entity65 normally works as a tumour suppressor in the intestines			0
' molecular studies of human colorectal cancer samples recently uncovered multiple mutations in the @entity65 gene , though there was no direct evidence that @entity65 deficiency was a risk factor for colorectal cancer in humans			0
dr @entity112 added : â€˜ our data suggest that individuals at high risk of developing recurrent intestinal tumours may benefit			2

researchers gave capsicin , which gives chilli peppers their heat , to mice
*animals* are genetically prone to developing tumours in gastrointestinal tract
@entity128 triggered pain receptor , setting off reaction reducing tumour risk
treatment extended lifespan of mice by more than 30 per cent
bowel cancer is third most common type of cancer in the @entity36
