making it official : @entity1 and @entity2 have announced they are splitting after 14 years together news of the split comes just a month after it was claimed the couple were ' working on ' getting their relationship back on track			1
according to people tonight , they ' tried for months ' with a source telling the publication : ' they 've tried for months to save the relationship but have known for weeks that it could n't be saved			2
' the ' @entity19 ' star recently blasted untrue speculation about his relationship being over and said : ' the rumours are not true			2
they are absolutely not true			0
' no matter what i say about this , people believe the opposite			0
i ca n't say enough about it not being over			0
' and it seems that @entity1 was determined to weather the bad times , making a last ditch bid to save the relationship			2
at the time a source told @entity54 news : ' for the first time in a long time , he is talking about her [ @entity2 ]			2
they both want to make it work			0
' rumours : @entity1 and his @entity20 co-star @entity22 who was seen accompanying him to @entity62 on his private jet as he promoted his latest film @entity19 @entity2 also denied the speculation and hit out against the claims in tv chat show @entity67 as she promoted her new movie @entity70			1
she said : '' people say we are buying houses in the middle of nowhere , or that we have fifty two houses in @entity14			0
' and that is along with saying we split up every winter and get married every summer , and that i 'm on my twelfth pregnancy			2
' all that is not too serious , but this latest one is a rumour which could cause a lot of harm to my family and my children			2
' however , a few months later a number of publications carried pictures and reports that @entity1 and @entity91 enjoyed a trip together to @entity62 on a private plane when he was in town promoting @entity95 movie @entity19			1
hitching more than a ride ? @entity91 was snapped boarding @entity1 's private jet with the actor in @entity62 in april again , @entity2 was nowhere to be seen and did n't accompany him on any of his promotional duties for the film			1
hiding her troubles : a glum - looking @entity2 hidden under a big hat jetted out of @entity103 last week last month they continued to deny that their relationship was on the rocks , but @entity2 was snapped walking round @entity103 looking rather glum and hiding under a big hat			2
last week she scowled at photographers as she flew out of @entity103 under another huge hat as she jetted to @entity14 for the @entity111			0
and ever the professional , three days later she flashed her sexy gap - toothed smile as she joined her co-stars for the photocall for her new movie @entity116 ( i was made very small )			0
and throughout the day she did not shy away from meeting people and was happy to sign items for fans , even though the announcement of her split from @entity1 was imminent			1
@entity1 , 48 , and @entity2 , 39 , got together in 1998 when they met in the @entity124 in @entity125 while he was filming the @entity127 film @entity128			1

a year after they got together , @entity1 and @entity2 's first child , daughter @entity138 , was born , followed by their son @entity140 in 2002			1
in 2007 , the family were in @entity143 when @entity11 fell ill with a serious @entity145 infection that caused her kidneys to start shutting down and she was rushed to @entity147			0
so grateful was @entity1 for the care and attention the staff gave his daughter that in november 2007 he visited in his @entity153 character @entity152 to visit the patients and the following year he donated £ 1million to the hospital			2
ever the professional : just a couple of days ago , @entity2 put on a brave face as she attended a photocall for her new film in @entity160 , @entity14 and happily signed autographs for fans he and @entity2 never married but he recently stated that having children cemented roots for him and added that they gave him ' real foundation , a real strong place to stand in life , in work , in everything '			1
new love : @entity1 and @entity2 at the @entity172 premiere in 1999 , just a year after they met he added : ' you ca n't plan the kind of deep love that results in children			1
fatherhood was not a conscious decision			0
it was part of the wonderful ride i was on			0
it was destiny ; kismet			0
all the math finally worked			0
' and @entity2 explained why the pair never felt the need to marry and said : ' i love the romance of " let 's get married " , but then , when you have it so perfect ... i mean , i 'm more married than anybody can be – we have two kids			2
maybe one day , but it 's something i can really do without			0
' in 2010 , she also gushed : ' i could make an endless list of all the things i admire about him			0
' we understand that , if we want our relationship to continue , we must give each other space , allow each other to go off on our own , and trust each other			0
not everyone is lucky enough to be given space and trust			0
