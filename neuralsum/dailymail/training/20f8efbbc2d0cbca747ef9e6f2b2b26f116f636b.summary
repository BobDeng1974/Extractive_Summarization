the @entity0 has scrupulously cataloged the number of ' airstrikes ' @entity3 forces have inflicted on the terrorism army that 's running roughshod across @entity6 and @entity7 , but the official totals have lowballed the actual number of missile and bomb strikes considerably , @entity12 has learned			1
@entity14 ( @entity14 ) issues near - daily press releases announcing how many airstrikes have been launched , and updating its total – which stood at 148 on monday afternoon			2
a @entity0 insider familiar with logistics and planning in @entity7 , however , told @entity12 on friday that @entity3 aerial vehicles , including fighter jets and drones , ' have hit or destroyed well over 500 [ targets ] now			1
' ' the problem is that no one outside the [ @entity0 ] knows what an airstrike is , ' he said			2
' everybody thinks it 's a single bomb			2
@entity3 airstrikes have taken out hundreds of targets like this one , even as the @entity42 administration sends out more modest numbers some of the airstrikes over the weekend targeted @entity38 positions near the @entity46 , but the number of airstrikes does n't necessarily say much about the number of targets the @entity3 hit these 500 - pound @entity52 - 54 bombs being loaded onto a @entity54 jet can obliterate the most hard - armored humvee , and the aircraft can carry four at a time ' but think of a @entity58 [ bomber ] during @entity59 those planes could carry lots of 500 - pound bombs – 15 or 16 of ' em – on a single mission , ' he continued			1
' today we strap 11 missiles and bombs to the underside of a single @entity69 jet , fire all of that hardware at @entity38 , and we call it a single airstrike			2
' the source , a career @entity74 officer , spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly about @entity3 military operations			0
he also said a typical predator drone can carry four hellfire guided missiles at a time			0
the @entity0 has been atypically transparent about both its airstrike totals and the nature of the targets it 's destroying			1
at the @entity87 , a @entity86 spokesperson told @entity12 that the @entity42 administration is ' being very precise about that			1
' ' no one is lowballing the number of strikes , ' the spokesperson said			0
still , the ' airstrike ' numbers and ' target ' numbers rarely line up neatly in military press releases			0
and that could provide an opportunity for the @entity42 administration as it strains to meet an anxious public 's expectations of tough talk			1
on sunday , for instance , @entity14 announced that the @entity3 military had ' conducted four airstrikes saturday ' against the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , which the @entity42 administration has referred to by its alternate name @entity38			1
but that same announcement announced that ' the strikes destroyed five @entity108 , one @entity38 armed vehicle , an @entity38 checkpoint and also damaged an @entity38 bunker			2
' another strike near @entity113 , described in the press release , ' damaged an @entity115			0
' nine targets in all were destroyed or damaged			0
similarly , @entity14 said friday that ' four airstrikes ' had destroyed seven targets – ' an @entity38 observation post , one @entity115 , one @entity38 armed vehicle , one @entity38 truck , and three @entity38 mortar positions			2
' @entity12 's @entity0 source did not discus specific targets or describe what kinds of armaments or ammunition was being used in the @entity128			1
similarly , @entity14 spokesman @entity129 said that ' we are n't going into detail about specific numbers and types of aircraft platforms or the types and numbers of ordinance [ sic ] used in airstrikes			0
' in emails on friday , @entity139 confirmed that the @entity3 has hit more targets than the raw number of airstrikes would suggest , calling that conclusion ' accurate			1
' ' an airstrike may include one or more platforms engaging multiple targets , ' he said			0
multiple bombs : this @entity3 @entity153 jet comes equipped with 11 total ' hardpoints , ' each of which can support a missile or a laser - guided bomb : 2 on the wingtips , 6 under the wings , and 3 under the fuselage @entity42 told @entity161 anchor @entity160 on sunday 's ' @entity162 ' broadcast that ' the next phase ' of battling @entity38 ' is now to start going on some offense ' why so modest ? as @entity87 press secretary @entity165 brags that @entity42 is willing ' to go wherever is necessary to strike those who are threatening @entity3 , ' the @entity0 is putting out the most modest numbers available to show the president 's level of aggression as president @entity42 prepares to deliver a speech wednesday in which he outlines a long - awaited strategy for attacking @entity38 , both @entity173 and @entity174 on @entity175 are calling on him to get tough with the @entity178 terror group			1
the videotaped beheadings of @entity3 journalists @entity180 and @entity182 have set off a firestorm of criticism in @entity185 , with voices all across the political spectrum suggesting that the president has waited too long to assume an aggressive posture			2
' the president is a failure in this area , ' @entity190 @entity189 sen. @entity189 said monday on the @entity193 , ' and i feel sad about it – and we will pay a heavy price in the end because he failed to act			0
' and in a @entity199 op - ed , @entity202 @entity173 sen. @entity201 wrote sunday that @entity42 ' must lead an aggressive , international effort to confront and eliminate @entity38 , including sustained airstrikes in @entity7 and @entity6			1
' ' we either confront @entity38 now or we 'll have to confront it later – when it will be a much stronger enemy , ' she said			0
@entity42 himself is fighting a tough game of public perceptions fed by his widely varying statements about how the @entity3 will handle the long - term threat @entity38 poses to the @entity3 homeland			1
last week in @entity215 , the president boasted that he aimed to ' degrade and destroy ' @entity38			2
but minutes later he recast his ambitions in a softer light , talking about making the murderous terror group a ' manageable problem			0
' that performance followed a disastrous moment at the @entity87 when he stated that ' we do n't have a strategy yet ' to determine whether the @entity3 would chase @entity38 into @entity6 in addition to striking it over @entity7 airspace			1
' we either confront @entity38 now or we 'll have to confront it later -- when it will be a much stronger enemy , ' @entity202 sen. @entity201 , a fellow @entity226 , warned the president in @entity199 but on sunday in an appearance on the @entity161 ' @entity162 ' program , he promised he would soon be ' preparing the country ' for an armed confrontation			0
' the next phase is now to start going on some offense , ' he said , while qualifying his goals in the sense that they do n't include ' @entity3 ground troops			0
this is not the equivalent of the @entity7 war			0
' already , @entity42 's chief spokesman @entity165 is touting his boss 's military - offensive bona fides. on monday in the @entity87 press room , @entity165 boasted @entity42 's ' willingness to go wherever is necessary to strike those who are threatening @entity3			1
' in that environment , two @entity174 congressional staffers told @entity12 , it may soon be time for the @entity42 administration to replace its periodic tally of ' airstrikes ' with a more meaningful count of @entity38 targets the @entity0 has hit			1
' not too long ago , the president did n't want to seem over-eager to pull the trigger , ' one @entity256 senior aide said , ' but now the game has changed			0
why not do something to look tougher ? if the numbers are there , use them			0

official total of ' airstrikes ' against @entity38 terror *network* in @entity7 hit 148 on monday as @entity42 prepares to brief the nation wednesday on his strategy
but most of those strikes aim at , or destroy , more than one single target
@entity0 insider tells @entity12 the administration has hit ' well over 500 ' targets including tanks , humvees , bunkers , mortars and checkpoints
@entity0 confirms that it 's ' accurate ' to say @entity3 forces are hitting more targets than the ' airstrike ' totals would suggest
as political winds shift in a hawkish *direction* , @entity42 may find it useful to claim credit for a more aggressive approach than the public has heard of
