the @entity0 has been called in to help analyse the home flight simulator belonging to the pilot of the missing @entity4 plane			1
a @entity6 official , speaking anonymously , says the @entity0 is currently working on data from the simulator while @entity10 's defense minister says investigators are trying to restore files			1
it is thought the files were deleted last month by pilot capt. @entity15			1
files containing records of simulations carried out on the program were deleted february 3			1
attorney general @entity20 said wednesday @entity6 investigators are prepared to help any way they can			1
deleting files would not necessarily represent anything unusual , especially if it were to free up memory space , but investigators would want to check the files for any signs of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went			1
today it was also revealed that a remote island in the middle of the @entity27 with a runway long enough to land a @entity29 was programmed into the home flight simulator of the pilot of the missing @entity4 plane			1
police are now urgently investigating whether captain @entity15 had practised landing at @entity24 , an island south of the @entity36 occupied by the @entity6 navy			2
people on the island of @entity61 reported seeing '' low flying jumbo jet ' on the morning of the disappearance of @entity64 police seized the simulator from his home outside @entity68 over the weekend and reassembled it at police headquarters , hoping for information on the flight 's fate			1
the investigation into the @entity24 , an overseas territory of the @entity75 , which is rented to the @entity6 and is now a huge @entity6 naval base follows fresh eyewitness accounts of a ' low flying jumbo jet ' being spotted in the @entity36			2
people on the island of @entity61 reported seeing a plane on the morning of the disappearance of @entity64 , according to a @entity81 , a news website in the @entity36			1
an eyewitness told the website : ' i 've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before			2
we 've seen seaplanes , but i 'm sure that this was not one of those			0
i could even make out the doors on the plane clearly			0
' it 's not just me either , several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing			1
some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too			0
' captain @entity15 , a father - of - three , was passionate about his simulator , which he built using off - the - shelf parts			1

he told @entity116 : ' his hobby was flying			1
he loves flying and he wants to share with my his friends			0
he was open to his friends ' his best friend @entity112 insisted the simulator was just for fun and told @entity116 : ' his hobby was flying			1
he loves flying and he wants to share with my his friends			0
he was open to his friends			0
â€™ capt @entity15 had joined an online flight simulator community called @entity131 and after making his simulator , in november 2012 he posted a message about its ' awesome view ' inviting ' buddies ' to get in touch so they could take the simulator ' to the next level of simulation			1

' probe : police in @entity10 searched the home of pilot @entity15 ( right ) and @entity64 ( left ) after officials confirmed the plane was taken over by a ' deliberate act ' investigators probing the disappearance of a @entity4 jetliner with 239 people on board believe it most likely flew into the southern @entity27 , a source close to the investigation said today			1
no wreckage has been found from @entity64 , which vanished from air traffic control screens off @entity10 's east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on march 8 ( 1721 gmt march 7 ) , less than an hour after taking off from @entity68 bound for @entity174			1
an unprecedented search for the @entity176 is under way involving 26 nations in two vast search ' corridors ' : one arcing north overland from @entity182 towards the @entity183 , the other curving south across the @entity27 from west of @entity187 's @entity186 island to west of @entity188			2
' the working assumption is that it went south , and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor , ' said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
the view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace , and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor			0
a relative of a @entity211 passenger aboard the missing @entity64 shows a paper reading ' hunger strike protest , @entity215 life , return my relative , do n't want become victim of politics , @entity219 ' families of the passengers aboard the missing plane decided to organize a hunger strike to express their anger and disappointment at the handling of the situation by authorities @entity211 , which is leading the northern corridor search with @entity230 , said it had not yet found any sign of the aircraft crossing into its territory			1
@entity235 and @entity6 officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course , but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why			0
the minister in charge of the operation said the multinational search team was deploying the most sophisticated equipment available to find the plane			0
' it probably is the largest peacetime armada of assets and satellite information - sharing that we have ever seen for a rescue and search operation , ' @entity10 's acting transport minister @entity38 said			2
officials believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the @entity29 and commercial aviation navigation switched off two vital datalinks : the @entity261 system , which relays maintenance data back to the ground , and the transponder , which enables the plane to be seen by civilian radar			2
the source close to the investigation said that it was thought ' highly probable that @entity261 was switched off prior to the final verbal message ' received for the cockpit			0
a pilot of an @entity274 maritime patrol aircraft scanning the surface of the sea during a search operation for the missing @entity64 to the west of @entity10 two @entity279 have been assigned to the @entity235 - coordinated search for @entity64 that message , an informal ' all right , good night ' radioed to @entity235 air traffic controllers to acknowledge their handover of the plane to @entity289 airspace , was believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot , the airline said earlier this week			1
investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that minutes later the plane turned sharply west , re-crossing the @entity296 and following an established commercial route towards @entity298			1
after that , ephemeral pings picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours			0
the data from the satellite placed the plane somewhere in one of the two corridors when the final signal was sent at 8:11 a.m. the methodical shutdown of the communications systems , together with the fact that the plane appeared to be following a planned course after turning back , have been interpreted as suggesting strongly that foul play , rather than some kind of technical failure , was behind the disappearance			2
last week , a source familiar with official @entity6 assessments said it was thought most likely the plane flew south , where it presumably would have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea			0
on board : student @entity326 , pictured centre with his family , was one of the 239 aboard @entity64 @entity112 ( left ) with best friend captain @entity15 ( right ) , pilot of the missing @entity4 plane			1
he is pictured in a t - shirt with a democracy is dead slogan as police investigate claims he could have hijacked the plane as an anti-government protest if it did indeed end up in the southern @entity27 , one of the remotest places on @entity342 and also one of the deepest seas , it increases the chance it may never be found - and investigators may never know for sure what happened on board			1
@entity6 government sources said intelligence agencies had extensively analysed people on the flight but came up with no connections to terrorism or possible criminal motives			2
a senior @entity6 official said he was ' not aware of any stones left unturned '			0
@entity211 has said there is no evidence that @entity211 passengers , who made up over two - thirds of those on board , were involved in a hijack or act of sabotage			0
@entity188 is leading the search of the southern part of the southern corridor , with assistance from the @entity370			0
it has shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents , but it still covers an area of 600,000 sq km ( 230,000 sq miles ) , roughly the size of @entity379 and @entity380			2
the @entity370 said it had switched mainly to using @entity381 and @entity383 aircraft to search for the missing plane instead of ships and helicopters			2
' the maritime patrol aircraft are much more suited for this type of operation , ' said @entity370 lieutenant @entity390 , who is on board the @entity392			0
' ... it 's just a much more efficient way to search			2

@entity0 are looking at *electronic* files deleted from pilot 's home flight simulator
hoped files will give help discover what happened to missing @entity64
simulator taken from pilot 's home outside @entity68 at the weekend
investigators said today data had been deleted but they are retrieving it
best friend tells @entity116 simulator is ' nothing special , just a hobby '
