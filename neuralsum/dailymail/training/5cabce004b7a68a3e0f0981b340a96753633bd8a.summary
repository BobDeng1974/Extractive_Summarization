juice boost : men over 40 who follow a diet rich in @entity28 , which can be found in citrus fruits , as well as @entity30 , zinc and folate may increase their chance of fatherhood previous research has shown that the older a man is , the more chance he has of dna fragmentation and chromosomal rearrangements in his sperm			1
these can lead to a higher chance of being infertile or having children with a disability			0
