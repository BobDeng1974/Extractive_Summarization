we ’re a week on now from the accident that left a cricketer dead and a sport in mourning			1
it ’s too early to know what happens next			2
emotions are raw , and the uncertainty over the dates for the @entity12 - @entity11 series reflected the sense that the sport had to go on – though no one could really say quite how , where or when			1
playing cricket feels like an utterly inadequate response to the death of @entity20			1
but it also feels like the only response			2
there are no answers lurking within the next batch of runs or wickets			2
perhaps there is a little solace			2
a tribute to @entity20 attached to a fence of a car dealership in his hometown of @entity34 mourners lay flowers at a tribute to @entity20 in the town on @entity40 's mid-north coast a cricket bat with the message ' @entity43 ' and with green and gold ribbons attached hangs by a sports field @entity48 has stared deep into its own soul these past few days and been confused by what it has seen			1
are helmets safe ? should we ban the bouncer ? how can an innings end like this ? the idea that reality has intruded on the idyll has been disquieting – though there has rarely been anything idyllic about standing 20 yards away from a man hurling a hard ball at you			2
as if to remind us that cricket can be perilous , the @entity20 tragedy was followed quickly by the death of @entity67 , an @entity69 umpire who was struck in the neck out in the middle			1
truly , the cosmos is in a dark mood			0
for more musings on @entity76 ’s tour of @entity77 and other matters cricketing , please follow us on @entity79 @ the_topspin			1
what can cricket do , if it can do anything at all ? it can accept , finally , that it is only a game , not a higher calling , not a test of manhood , not a cookie jar for the spivs and the suits			1
it can cling on to , and bottle , the sense of togetherness that might just have helped those who knew @entity20 best make some sense of their loss			1
without realising it , we may even have stumbled across a convincing definition of cricket ’s fabled spirit			1
though cricket told itself otherwise , it never was a question of whether a bowler runs out a batsman for backing up too far , or a fielder claims a catch on the bounce			2
@entity111 ( right ) put the game of cricket into perspective following the death of @entity20 ( left ) @entity12 captain @entity115 wept at a press conference in @entity117 when talking about his good friend it was always about the sense of community , from @entity122 via @entity123 to @entity34			1
even as cricket sheds tears , it has grown stronger			2
above all , it can help us to be kinder			0
when @entity132 ’s @entity131 was dismissed for a carefree but futile 137 on the final afternoon of the @entity133 on sunday , @entity130 ’s @entity129 ran 30 or 40 yards to shake his hand			0
throughout that test , wickets and hundreds inspired only muted celebrations			0
the tragic context should not distract us from the gut feeling that cricket is a better sport when it is played like this			2
mutual respect can extend beyond the days of grief			0
@entity132 batsman @entity131 hit a brilliant 137 against @entity130 in a timely reminder of cricket 's spirit a teacher watches children play cricket at the @entity34 on tuesday here in @entity77 , we ’re all doing our best to get worked up about another one - day blowout by @entity76 , but hearts are not in it			1
to judge from his demeanour about the place , @entity111 – an old hand at smiling politely in the face of vitriol – is being true to the words he spoke ahead of last saturday ’s game in @entity163			1
talking on the morning after @entity20 ’s death , @entity111 said : ‘ what ’s happened in the last three days has certainly clarified in my mind that ’s it just a game of sport			1
we are incredibly lucky to play the game			2
but it ’s just a game of sport			2
we have a massive responsibility to play it the right way			0
’ @entity111 should n’t be in @entity76 ’s one - day team , let alone captaining it			1
but he ’s got his priorities right , and it ’s hard not to like him for that			0
( incidentally , it has been suggested that @entity111 used @entity20 ’s death as some kind of excuse for @entity76 ’s performance on saturday			1
) cricket ’s task , too , is to get its priorities right			2
it does n’t matter enough for grown men to be snarling at each other , but it does matter enough for our administrators to get their act together			1
the sport needs cherishing and protecting , and it ought to start immediately			0
but his legacy can last for ever			0
@entity194 all hail the @entity195 … @entity196 said he felt ' pretty empty ' after steering @entity130 to a famous win in @entity198 over the weekend : events elsewhere had put the third test against @entity132 into its proper perspective			0
but no - one would begrudge him some quiet satisfaction about the progress his side have made			0
their 1 - 1 draw in the @entity207 – in a country where both @entity76 and @entity12 have been thrashed – means @entity130 are unbeaten in five @entity210 series stretching back to their loss in @entity76 in 2013			1
almost as startling , they are now only a couple of points away from relegating @entity11 to seventh in the @entity216 rankings			1
compare and contrast the raw cricketing materials at the disposal of those two nations , and you get sense of @entity130 ’s achievement			0
they have become one of the most watchable sides in the game			2
the brilliant @entity196 bats during @entity195 's victory against @entity132 in the @entity207 … and their captain a fair chunk of this is down to @entity196 himself			2
this year alone , he has compiled test scores of 224 , 302 ( both against @entity11 ) and 202			1
he has done it while shifting between the middle order and the opener ’s role , and while reinventing himself as a cover fielder			0
gloriously , his fourth - best test score in 2014 is 45			0
it may just be the most ruthless conversion - rate in history			0
nothing to see here : @entity245 as the lawyers of @entity216 chairman @entity248 continue to fight for their client ’s reputation in @entity11 ’s @entity251 , it was instructive to learn of @entity253 ’s thoughts on the investigation into corruption at the 2013 @entity256 and the inner workings of @entity259 cricket			1
asked if he felt this long - running fiasco had affected the image of the sport in @entity11 , the man formerly known as the president of the @entity262 is reported to have said : ‘ i do n’t agree that @entity259 cricket is taking a hit , i am not able to share your sentiments on that			1
’ what , one wonders , constitutes a ‘ hit ’ in the weird and wonderful world of @entity248 ? rip @entity20 i only interviewed him once , on a quiet morning at @entity273 in 2009 , the day after he had made 195 for @entity274 against @entity275 in the @entity276			1
the game was still going on , and later that day @entity20 would hit 57 off 46 balls			1
@entity274 finished nine down and two runs short of their target of 186 in 25 overs			0
he was the talk of the town			0
@entity20 celebrated an outstanding century for @entity274 against @entity275 at @entity273 in 2009 @entity20 did n’t have to turn up early to chat to a journalist he ’d never met , especially in the middle of a game			1
but he was there at the appointed time			0
@entity292 cricketers can be guilty of over-analysis			0
it struck me there was little danger of @entity20 doing the same			1
‘ there ’s been a fair bit of talk about my technique , but i just want to stick to my own gameplan , ’ he said , as if the alternative would have been an affront			0
‘ it ’s how i play			0
everyone has their own style and that ’s something i just want to keep going			0
sure , bowlers will have their plans , but you can look at it in two different ways : i have my plans too			0
we ’ll just go from there			0
’ in five innings for @entity274 that summer before he joined the @entity319 tour , @entity20 scored 574 runs at an average of 143			1
people were scoffing at his technique , but he did it his way and appeared to love every minute			0
there ’s a lesson in there somewhere .			0

@entity12 and @entity11 series has been *delayed* with @entity20 ' *funeral* this week
tragedy should remind everyone of the true spirit of cricket
@entity76 captain @entity111 best summed up the right *attitude*
