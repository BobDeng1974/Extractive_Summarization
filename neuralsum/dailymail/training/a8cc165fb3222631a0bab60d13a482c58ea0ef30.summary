@entity0 visited the @entity1 after their 7 - 1 demolition of @entity3 on tuesday night			1
afterwards , mind you , not beforehand			0
@entity0 needed no divine intervention			1
they just needed to do what they do when they hit their best form : swarm irrepressibly over the opposition			0
except swarm does n't really do it justice			0
better the phrase used by @entity16 magazine ' kicker ' , which described @entity0 , and @entity20 's plan , as ' more precise than a world famous surgeon '			1
that was what marked this @entity0 performance out as so special			2
it was n't that @entity3 defended particularly poorly – they even had a few strong chances on goal themselves – it was that @entity0 's attacks were so precise			1
the @entity30 simply could not plug the eye of every single needle			0
@entity0 's stars celebrate their famous victory in front of their travelling support at the final whistle this , as @entity20 has now successfully convinced the world , is not tiki - taka			1
yet this is absolutely @entity20 's @entity0			1
three at the back playing a high line , with a total of three players on each wing , all overlapping perpetually			2
a rock solid distributor in @entity47 , and a couple of effortless space creators in the centre of attack in @entity52 and @entity53			0
the result is that @entity0 can perpetually switch the play , without being caught on the counter attack			2
it means they can perpetually push forward , without forcing their opposition merely to park the bus			0
it is an immensely precise , but also an immensely flexible system			2
@entity20 has demanded from day one that his players are able and willing to fill at least two different roles across a season			1
last night , many of them did so in the space of half an hour			0
@entity68 was full of praise for his coach , saying ' huge praise goes to the training staff , who set us up perfectly '			0
as @entity20 put it after the game , though , ' good tactics are useless without good players '			1
@entity0 players celebrate during their sensational 7 - 1 thrashing of @entity3 in the @entity80 @entity0 's @entity68 ran rings around @entity3 's @entity82 ( pictured , left ) who was substituted at half - time @entity53 scores his header while former @entity86 defender @entity82 ( left ) looks on helplessly at the moment , @entity0 finally seem to be harmonising the incredible quality of their squad with the innovative brilliance of their manager			1
last season , it often appeared that they were trying too much to fit themselves to @entity20 's system			1
in their current form , they do n't need to – it just comes naturally			0
for the fans , this is seventh heaven			0
@entity20 remains a little too exotic to become a local cult hero like @entity100 at @entity101 or @entity102 at @entity0 , but there are no complaints anymore about his adaptation of @entity0			1
for this team , winning is not enough – they have to dominate and destroy			0
that is exactly what they are doing , having scored seventeen goals in their last three games			0
there is a chant among @entity0 fans which simply goes : ' @entity116 , @entity0 , hey ! '			2
the team which took apart @entity3 on tuesday night did look superhuman			2
their strength , their flowing football , their precision were all simply out of this world			0
@entity122 of @entity0 scores his team 's sixth goal during the @entity126 match @entity0 players link arms in celebration after their comprehensive victory over @entity3 in @entity30			1

@entity0 destroyed @entity3 7 - 1 in the @entity126
@entity0 's attacks were precise and gave @entity3 no chance
the squad are now in harmony with manager @entity20
the players have answered their manager 's call to be flexible
