by @entity1 reporter published : 21:04 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 01:50 est , 9 november 2013 when it comes to sex , no area of @entity3 sees more action than @entity7 , while a remote part of @entity9 seems to be going through a severe dry spell			2
the matchmaking site @entity12 and its column @entity11 put together a handy map of @entity3 's neighborhoods whose dwellers enjoy knocking boots with many different lovers			2
although the map based on data from the 2012 @entity22 is supposed to show which parts of the @entity24 are having the most sex , a more accurate description of the project would be - which areas are the most promiscuous			1
@entity30 : the dating site @entity12 put together this map based on data from the 2012 @entity22 to show which areas of the @entity24 see the most action in the bedroom the dark - red areas on the chart indicate zones where residents have had three of more sexual partners in the past year			1
areas shaded in light pink show where @entity3 are likely spending their nights in chaste solitude			0
people enjoying the busiest , or most philandering , sex lives reside in @entity7 , where nearly 20 per cent of the community reported multiple paramours in the past year			1
@entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 in @entity54 and @entity55 in @entity56 also showed a penchant for bed - hopping last year			0
@entity59 business : people enjoying the busiest sex life reside in @entity7 , when nearly 20 per cent of the community reported multiple paramours in the past year and it looks like the devastation of @entity66 did nothing to kill the mood for people who call the @entity70 their home			1
another hotbed of amorous activity was @entity74 , but the rest of the borough did not rise to the occasion			0
last - place finish : @entity79 in @entity56 , and @entity80 and @entity81 in @entity54 did not do well in the sex department @entity54 , @entity83 and @entity85 dwellers have proven themselves to be far less frisky than some of their neighbors , but even they did better in the lust department than their counterparts from @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity93			0
@entity94 pointed out , however , that the map has one major flaw : it does not recognize people who have consistent sex with fewer partners .			0

map was put together by a dating website based on the 2012 @entity22
@entity7 *emerged* as @entity80 's *biggest* sex *hotspot* , with nearly 20 per cent of *responders* saying they had three of more lovers in 12 *months*
