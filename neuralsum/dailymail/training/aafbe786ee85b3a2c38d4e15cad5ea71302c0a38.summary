by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:17 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 11:24 est , 26 october 2012 disgraced peer @entity2 branded a television presenter a ' jackass ' yesterday in a terse clash over the former media mogul ’s criminal past			1
the unrepentant convict criticised @entity11 ’s @entity10 for his ' predictable questions ' and accused the political editor of not knowing ' what he was talking about '			1
it came after a fractious interview on @entity18 ’s @entity17 on monday night , which saw black tell @entity19 he was proud he had endured their tense exchange without ' getting up and smashing your face in '			1
belligerent : @entity2 answers the ' predictable ' questions by @entity11 's @entity10 - who inadvertently uses his middle finger as a gesture while he questions him not amused : @entity2 is defiant about his convictions , and has attacked interviewers who have questioned him about his criminal past his belligerent displays promise a fiery appearance on friday night 's @entity33 quiz show , which will see him tackling panellists @entity36 and @entity38 , renowned for their scathing views on well - known figures			1
@entity2 , former proprietor of the @entity41 , has arrived in the @entity42 to promote his new book @entity43 , but is clearly in no mood to to answer any uncomfortable questions			2
he has taken the approach of denying that he was ever in the wrong and shouting at anyone who suggests he is a criminal			2
defiant @entity2 , who was imprisoned for three years for defrauding investors , insisted he had nothing to be ashamed of and indicated his potential plans to retake his seat in the @entity55			2
asked by mr @entity10 where he would live now he had been ' kicked out ' of the @entity57 , @entity2 said : ' stop being a jackass			1
you are just being abrasive			2
no , you do n’t know what you are talking about			2
' @entity2 said he was only tolerating the interview to publicise his unflinching memoir that describes his nine - year battle with the @entity57 justice system			0
@entity2 said he was proud of not ' smashing in ' @entity19 's face on the @entity17 interview after the presenter asked some probing questions @entity2 said he felt like vomiting after enduring @entity19 's unflinching questions about his convictions and his personal life he added : ' i ’m selling books			1
that ’s why i am here			0
i ’m not here to enjoy your somewhat predictable questions			0
' it is his memoir that has brought him to the @entity42 and the studios of @entity33 , @entity17 and @entity82 , a decision that has sparked amusement and amazement in equal measure			1
if there is one thing the panellists on the have i got news for you show like more than taking potshots at a pillar of the establishment , then it is demolishing a fallen pillar of the establishment – yet @entity2 , 68 , could n’t care less			0
mr @entity10 suggested @entity2 would end up as a ' figure of fun ' when he appears on the @entity18 ’s @entity33 later this week , but was told : ' we ’ll see who makes whom a figure of fun			1
i normally do n’t mind exchanging acerbities if that ’s what people want to do			0
' @entity2 , whose empire once included the @entity111 , the @entity112 and small papers across the @entity57 and @entity114 , returned to prison last september to finish serving his sentence , and was released in may			0
on monday night @entity2 , who was released from a @entity57 jail earlier this year , accused @entity19 of being a ' priggish , gullible , @entity42 fool ' for taking seriously the ' ghastly ' @entity57 justice system			1
' let me tell you something , i am proud of having gone through the terribly difficult process of being falsely charged , falsely convicted and ultimately almost completely vindicated without losing my mind , becoming irrational , ceasing to be a penitent and reasonable person and actually being able to endure a discussion like this without getting up and smashing your face in , which is what most people would do if they had been through what i had been			0
' @entity2 and his wife @entity133 , pictured at a court last year , have stayed strong despite the former media mogul 's time in prison coming out fighting : @entity2 insists he is not a criminal and made no ' ethical mistakes ' @entity19 said : ' well , you go ahead			1
' ' no , i do n’t believe in violence , ' @entity2 replied			0
asked if he expected to retain his seat in the @entity55 he said : ' well , why not ? first of all there is not a prohibition on a convicted criminal sitting in that @entity55			2
' he told @entity19 he had been ' persecuted half to death ' , before announcing : ' i do n't have any shame ' when questioned about his conviction , reiterating : ' i am not a criminal			1
' he insisted he was innocent , saying the accusations are ' rubbish , and anyone can see they are rubbish			0
i 'm not a convicted fraudster			0
' however , he did concede to a bemused - looking @entity19 that he had been too easy - going before his disgrace			1
he said : ' i will agree that i probably became a bit insouciant and , to that extent , my downfall was justified			0
' but he also insisted he was not a criminal and had a morally clean record : ' i have made a lot of mistake , but not ethical ones			1
' as his tense interview with @entity19 continued , he also complained that he was ' going to throw up ' when @entity19 quizzed him about @entity2 's wife , journalist @entity133 , and asked if she was extravagant with money			1
he said : ' after seven years away , my first morning back in @entity42 and i have to be subjected to this ? she 's a magnificent wife			2
' @entity2 , who owned a number of other world newspapers , was raised to the peerage as @entity2 in 2001			0
@entity2 showed that he was in no mood to tolerate any uncomfortable questions @entity19 threw at him in the @entity17 interview			1
his most belligerent lines included him telling @entity19 that he was a priggish , gullible , @entity42 fool			1
' he also told him that @entity19 's grasp of the @entity57 judicial system was lacking : ' your problem is that you have no idea how that system operates			1
' he demanded that @entity19 stop being so ' bourgeois ' with his questions , and told him that he was ' not a criminal			1
' he branded the bemused interviewer a ' priggish , gullible fool ' for daring to suggest that convicted @entity2 was a criminal			2
clearly feeling fired up after his appearance on @entity17 , an exasperated - looking @entity2 was interviewed by @entity10 on @entity82			1
the disgraced former media tycoon said he was only tolerating @entity10 's ' somewhat predictable questions ' because he is promoting his memoir			1
in another stinging swipe , @entity2 carelessly asked @entity10 his name again , as he had forgotten it earlier			2
he also told the political editor that he had ' no idea what he was talking about '			0
as a leaving remark , he assured @entity10 , who questioned him about his appearance on @entity202 , that he could defend himself against the notoriously acerbic wit of the pannelists			1
it started in 2003 when shareholders accused @entity2 of skimming off millions of dollars from his global newspaper empire between 1999 and 2001			0
he was charged , alongside his associates at @entity210 holding company , and eventually convicted of stealing $ 6.1 million			0
they were accused of amassing the cash by handing themselves tax - free bonuses , from the selling off of their newspapers , without the consent of the firm 's board			2
@entity2 was sentenced , in 2007 , to six and a half years ( 78 months ) in prison			0
but , after he had served 29 months , the @entity222 dissolved the ' honest services ' law that had formed the basis of his conviction			0
he was released in 2010 so that his case could be re-examined , and he succeeded in overturning two of his four initial convictions			0
it meant that he was responsible for de-frauding significantly less money than for what he was first convicted			0
the majority of his sentence pertained to an obstruction of justice - where he is said to have removed 13 boxes from his @entity238 office while under investigation			0
last june he was re-sentenced and was sent back to prison with 13 months left to serve			0
he was released five months in may early for good behaviour .			0
