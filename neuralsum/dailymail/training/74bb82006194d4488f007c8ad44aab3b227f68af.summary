by @entity0 published : 01:14 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 01:15 est , 12 june 2013 president @entity1 held a surprise secret meeting with several reporters at the @entity4 on monday , as he seeks to placate the press over a series of recent scandals			1
while off - the - record meetings are not new at the @entity4 , it was n't until the selected reporters were already in the meeting that the president arrived			1
the briefing had originally been listed as a briefing by @entity4 chief of staff , @entity14			2
clandestine : @entity1 in the @entity16			1
the president joined reporters for an off - the - record meeting the @entity20 has been criticized in the past week after details of the @entity23 's surveillance were leaked			1
the revelations come after reports of the @entity26 collecting @entity28 phone records , and the @entity29 allegedly targeting right - wing groups			0
about 24 reporters attended the meeting , where they were given direct access to the president as he discussed his thoughts on recent events - although they were not able to report what was said			1
when the @entity39 had attempted to hold a similar briefing in the wake of the revelation that it had collected phone records from @entity28 reporters , several news publications protested , and the @entity45 refused publicly to attend			0
with monday 's unexpected meeting , @entity45 reporter @entity46 said if he had known president @entity1 would be attending , he and his editors would have reconsidered whether to go to the briefing			1
pressure : president @entity1 is facing tough questions after revelations about national surveillance programs ' our concern about off - the - record sessions with the president is that they not become substitutes for opportunities to ask questions and get answers on the record which , after all , is our job , ' mr @entity46 told @entity63			1
secret briefings have been a common feature at the @entity4 , since @entity66 used to entertain his favored reporters in his office			0
after the off - the - record meeting , reporters who attended told @entity63 it had been a valuable experience in understanding the president 's thoughts , even if they were unable to share their insight with readers			1
the most recent leak to affect the @entity4 was the revelations about phone record and internet surveillance			0
on friday , the president had sought to address fears over the national security programs			2
one involves the collection of @entity88 @entity87 customers phone records			0
the other , dubbed @entity90 , allows the government to see the internet searches of foreign nationals overseas who use any of nine @entity88 - based internet providers such as @entity95 and @entity96			0
' my assessment and my team 's assessment was that [ the programs ] help us prevent terrorist attacks and that the modest encroachments on privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration [ of calls ] without a name attached ... it was worth us doing , ' he said			0
in his statement at the @entity4 he said @entity113 had approved the two programs			0
' i think it ’s important to understand that you ca n’t have 100 per cent security and then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience , ' the president said			2
tradition : secret meetings with the press have been a feature of the @entity4 since @entity66 's days at a briefing on tuesday , intelligence officials sought to convince @entity4 lawmakers that the collection of phone records and internet usage was necessary and did not trample on privacy rights			2
however , the @entity132 asked a @entity134 court on tuesday to demand that the @entity1 administration end the program and purge the records it has collected			2
polls by the @entity139 and @entity140 showed a majority of @entity88 support some aspects of the spy programs , putting the need to investigate terrorist threats over the need to protect personal privacy , according to @entity28 .			0
