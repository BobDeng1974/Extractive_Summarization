education secretary @entity0 said being bored was an important skill for children to learn children must learn to be bored and entertain themselves , says education secretary @entity0 in a warning to parents not to plan activities around the clock			1
the mother - of - one said parents have to ' grapple ' with limiting the amount of time children have with tablets and games consoles , insisting turning off gadgets forces them to play with traditional toys like @entity16 and cars			1
and she warned parents not to do homework themselves , stressing it does not help their children and good teachers will be catch them out			1
mrs @entity23 married husband @entity24 in 2000 and they have a seven - year - old son , @entity25			1
she balances her job in charge of schools across @entity29 with family life			0
many parents trying to plan extra-curricular activities to keep children occupied for every waking moment , but mrs @entity23 said is important to let children be bored			1
she told @entity36 magazine : ' i do think that , speaking as a mum , when my son says " i ’m bored " , i say " well , just go away and find something to do , you ’ve got lots of toys , lots of things there "			1
' and then suddenly i will find that my son is busy , has dragged something out , he ’s amusing himself , and i think that there is an element of not needing every moment in the day to be filled			2
' i think it ’s an important skill to be learned			1
if we say to him " just go and do something " , it ’s amazing how much the @entity16 will come out , or @entity56 , whatever it might be , and actually it ’s lovely then to see him , he ’s busy building things , @entity62 tracks			1
' however , while her parents ' generation just had to coax youngsters away from watching television , today children have many more hi - tech distractions			1
on one occasion @entity25 woke early one morning wanting to play on his tablet			2
' @entity25 woke us up at half past five			0
and as a result he lost gadget time for the rest of the day			1
' he was deeply unimpressed by that			0
we had a little negotiation about whether " gadget time " meant " tv and screen time "			1
' she went on : ' because of the growth of tablets and everything else and the fact that children are using them younger - which is many ways a good thing , they are great learning tools – i think it ’s all kinds of new challenges			1
' i guess our parents had ‘ tv time ’ , we had the same kind of issue , but i do think it ’s one of those things to grapple with			1
' mr @entity0 said parents have to ' grapple ' with limiting the amount of time children have with tablets and games console last year a study suggested that almost a quarter of parents complete homework with no input from their child			1
but mrs @entity23 said it was counter-productive and does little to help their children in the long run			2
' i think it ’s about parental supervision and support and engagement			0
you know it ’s not them			0
i would trust teachers to make sure they were asking for projects that work , that children are going to be doing			2
' they will make it clear to parents that you ’re not helping necessarily if you ’re doing an awful lot of it			2
' despite being in charge of the nation 's teachers , she confessed to being uneasy about talking to them			1
' i do think as a parent sometimes you want to know what ’s going on in the classroom but do n’t necessarily know how to ask			0
i still get nervous talking to teachers and it reminds you of being at school yourself			1
and seeing what your child is doing is really , really important			2
' education secretary @entity0 said she would like to send her son to a secondary state school when he is older mrs @entity23 said she would ' very much like ' to send her son to a state secondary school when he is older			1
the @entity147 mp , who was educated at the private @entity148 , indicated that she would follow her predecessor @entity149 and prime minister @entity150 in sending her child to a state secondary			0
in the wide - ranging interview , she also stressed the importance of teaching @entity156 values of tolerance and free speech to youngsters in the wake of the terror atrocities in @entity162			0
the @entity164 minister said the attacks by @entity167 extremists in the @entity169 capital were an example of what happens ' when people do n't appear to respect some of those values '			0
she said the attacks on satirical magazine @entity175 and a @entity177 supermarket in the @entity169 capital had shown the need to teach youngsters about the importance of " core values "			0
' one of the other things we are asking of schools is the whole teaching of @entity156 values			0
this applies to all schools , it 's about these core values			0
' we 've seen what can happen last week when people do n't appear to respect some of those values , things like tolerance and mutual respect			0
in the light of recent events ... it 's very , very important			2
' i know this is being discussed in governing boards up and down the country			0
many schools do this without necessarily badging it as such			0
and others are having to think ' how do we bring this in ? ' she said citizenship and social education classes were " very important ' and added ' we must have core common values , that builds us as a country '			2
mrs @entity23 said : " these @entity156 values have been defined in various strategies , by the @entity217 , and we are asking schools to think about how they promote them			0
@entity221 will be looking at them when they visit schools			0
' it 's about that shared history or heritage which i think makes us really strong as a country			0
we have freedom of speech and liberty in this country , we may not have had a revolution in the same way they perhaps had in @entity169 but i do think there are things that are precious and if we do n't guard them and if we do n't appreciate them ... sometimes we think it 's not very @entity156 to talk about them - but i think it 's now clear that we do need to talk about them			2
