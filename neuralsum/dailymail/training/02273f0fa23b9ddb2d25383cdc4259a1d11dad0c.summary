by @entity0 for the @entity1 until now , the humble plant pot has stood the test of time			2
first used by the ancient @entity6 to nurture their seedlings , the basic pot has been hardly altered in millennia			0
but @entity10 innovators claim to have improved on that universal design - and their container is being enthusiastically used by some of the country ’s leading horticulturists			2
each undulating surface is shaped like an egg carton			1
as the roots grow , they travel towards the holes and when they reach fresh air , the tips are naturally pruned as they dry out the @entity17 is based on the simple idea that plant roots need aeration , a concept that can radically improve the health of flowers and boost yield of fruit and vegetables			1
the @entity17 is a plastic container , made from recycled bottles , and perforated with holes			1
each undulating surface is shaped like an egg carton			1
as the roots grow , they travel towards the holes and when they reach fresh air , the tips are naturally pruned as they dry out			1
this encourages fresh , vigorous and bushy growth elsewhere in the root system , increasing the plant ’s uptake of water and nutrients			1
the design has been used by professional nurseries and gardens such as the @entity55 at @entity56 and @entity57 for a decade			0
sizes range from one litre up to 500 litres			0
the full range is only available to commercial growers , at a minimum order of £ 1,000 ( $ 1,680 )			0
online retailers sell the one - litre pot for £ 1.10 ( $ 1.85 )			2
packs of 10 and 14 litre pots are also available to amateur gardeners and a two pack costs £ 16 ( $ 28 ) and £ 18 ( $ 32 ) respectively			0
the plastic containers , which are made from recycled bottles , are perforated with dozens of holes and each undulating surface is shaped like an egg carton			1
in a traditional plant pot , the roots circle round and round the container , which can lead to the plant becoming ‘ pot bound ’			1
but the undulating surface of an @entity17 directs the roots towards the holes			1
when the roots reach fresh air the tips are naturally pruned as they dry out , encouraging fresh , vigorous and bushy growth elsewhere in the root system , increasing the plant ’s uptake of water and nutrients			1
the design has been used by professional nurseries and gardens such as the @entity55 at @entity56 and @entity57 for a decade			0
but now the @entity94 company which invented the @entity17 , @entity95 , is setting out to market the concept for amateur gardeners for the first time			2
when the roots reach fresh air , the tips are naturally pruned as they dry out , encouraging fresh , vigorous and bushy growth elsewhere in the root system			1
this increases the plant ’s uptake of water and nutrients and results in larger plants and produce			1
a carrot grown in an @entity17 is pictured @entity111 , marketing director at the firm , said : ‘ roots are n’t designed to be contained , and in a normal plant container they will just circle round and round , they essentially become deformed			1
‘ in the @entity17 the holes mean the roots are air - pruned , eliminating root circling			1
that encourages root growth , meaning healthier plants			0
‘ until now this has mainly been used for trees , but it works equally well with chillies , peppers , tomatoes , melons , potatoes - pretty much any plant you can think of			2
’ air - pots are available at a number of online retailers , starting at £ 1.10 for a one - litre pot , and the company is planning to ramp up its marketing for gardeners next @entity140			2
a cross-section of a tree growing in an @entity143 range from one litre up to 500 litres			0
the full range is only available to commercial growers , at a minimum order of £ 1,000 ( $ 1,680 )			0
online retailers sell the one - litre pot for £ 1.10 ( $ 1.85 ) the design has been used by professional nurseries and gardens such as the @entity55 at @entity56 and @entity57 for a decade			2
but now the @entity94 firm behind the design is setting out to market the concept for amateur gardeners for the first time @entity156 , head of arboretum at @entity55 , said : ‘ we have been using these to grow most of our trees for some years now and they are excellent			0
‘ they really are the best invention since the flowerpot all those centuries ago			0
‘ the root system is the engine of the tree			0
if you buy a car you have a look under the bonnet to see what the engine is like and it ’s exactly the same with a tree			0
‘ if a plant has a poor root system you are off to a bad start and it will never establish			0
‘ the root system needs oxygen as much as it needs moisture or nutrients and the @entity17 provides that			2
’ the firm said that , until now , the pots have mainly been used for trees , ( pictured ) but added they work equally well with chillies , peppers , tomatoes , melons , potatoes			0

the air - pot is based on the idea that plant roots need aeration
this can improve the health of flowers and boost yield of fruit and vegetables
