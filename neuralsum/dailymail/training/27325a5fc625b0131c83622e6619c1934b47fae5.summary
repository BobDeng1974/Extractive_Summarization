by @entity0 sir @entity1 had hoped to open the first of his new supermarkets on the ground floor of his latest hotel complex but has been scuppered by local planning chiefs the founder of @entity9 is looking for a new location for his first budget supermarket after plans to open it @entity14 , south @entity7 were thwarted by council planning bosses			1
sir @entity1 wanted to launch his new ' @entity16 on the ground floor of his new building , which is also set to become the latest in his @entity20 empire			1
but the idea was ruled out at an early stage by local planning chiefs , who insisted the building was outside the borough 's ' retail zone '			2
@entity14 will instead host a ' mock - up ' store which will be used to test the idea on focus groups before it is potentially launched in other less - affluent areas of the capital			1
@entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 have been mooted as potential locations for the first store , which could open as early as the end of this year if the response is good			0
a spokesman for @entity40 insisted the plans were still at an early stage and no store was likely to open until the group had seen the response of focus groups to the trial store			2
@entity40 , run by sir @entity1 , owns the brand which is now licenced to a range of businesses , including a car hire company , an office space rental firm , a hotel chain and a network of gyms			1
he remains the largest single shareholder in @entity9 , which he founded in 1995			0
annoucing his plans to open supermarkets last year , he said : ' i have a feeling that there is a gap in the food retail market – a niche below some of the current budget operators such as @entity68 and @entity69			0
' he said of the store : ' concentrating on affordable , basic " no - brand - name " packet and tinned foods at bargain prices , @entity16 underlines the need for additional reliable day - to - day provision of basic foodstuffs			0
' he then set out his hopes that the former @entity80 building the company had taken over in @entity14 would combine the brand 's hotels , offices , a gym and the first of his supermarkets			0
the new supermarket was earmarked to open on the ground floor of the converted @entity80 in @entity14 ( pictured ) , which is due to be turned into an @entity90 , @entity20 and @entity91 but it emerged today that planners rejected his bid to install the new shop in the area , forcing him to look elsewhere			1
the news came after sir @entity1 announced plans to list his budget hotel chain on the stock market on friday			1
his @entity20 business , which currently runs 20 hotels , wants to raise £ 60m in the move , the first flotation the tycoon has attempted since his airline floated in 2000			0
the firm currently runs two hotels it owns , as well as having 17 franchised units			0
it operates in cities such as @entity7 , @entity113 , and @entity114 as well as sir @entity1 's native @entity115			2
sir @entity1 said : ' i see @entity20 as one of the best , most natural extensions of the easy brand from the airline			1
@entity20 is raising money to accelerate growth at a much faster rate than i could have grown it as a private company			0

sir @entity1 had planned to open a trial store in @entity14
it would have formed the ground floor of an @entity20 and office complex
but his plans were *nipped* in the bud by local planning bosses
the site will now host a *closed* mock - up of how the store will look
this will be tested on shoppers before the chain is potentially *expanded*
