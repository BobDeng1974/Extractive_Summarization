by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 10:54 est , 11 september 2012 @entity2 fans are looking forwards with keen anticipation to the expected launch of the @entity6 tomorrow			1
but it is possible @entity2 might surprise us ' one last thing ' by the end of tomorrow 's presentation - an @entity10 , a shrunken - down , pocket - friendly of the iconic tablet which ushered in the post-pc era			1
now , a leak from @entity16 website shows us the potential size of @entity2 's new range and - even if all we are looking at is cases - is the first image to show us how an enthusiast 's collection will stack up			0
is this the new @entity23 ? this image purports to show us the scale of the @entity25			0
from bottom left , the current @entity27 , the ' @entity6 ' , the ' @entity10 ' , and the @entity10 if the @entity32 does not arrive tomorrow , a number of leaks and images of prototypes imply the device will be on shelves before @entity35			1
these images appeared on a @entity16 supplier 's website , before being spotted by @entity40 website nowhereelse.fr			0
@entity41 said the images conform to previous leaks about the @entity10 , and their own mocked - up @entity10 , based on specifications revealed over the last few months , matched these covers ' perfectly '			2
the blog website added : ' in addition , the location of the holes cut into multiple accessory supposedly designed to protect the @entity10 correspond perfectly with the positioning of components			0
' the leak shows off the purported size of the @entity10 : this is not an actual model , but a mock - up based on the leaks from suppliers since june the @entity32 is believed to sport an eight - inch screen , making it a shrunken version of the @entity10 's ten - inches			1
this will allow a higher degree of portability over previous models , and also give @entity2 the ammunition to compete with @entity67 , which recently brought out a seven - inch range of @entity70 tablets			2
it is also believed to be a 3g - capable model , meaning you can use data on the go			0
while @entity80 was famously against smaller @entity25 , the success of the @entity70 and @entity78 's ' fire ' of budget tablets appears to have convinced @entity2 there is a market for the slim - line device			1
rumours from @entity2 suppliers suggest the innards of the @entity10 will be equivalent to an ipad 2 , which analysts suggest will be more than enough to power the shrunken device			2
the third @entity10 had a specification increase but also increased slightly in weight due to the demands of the high - definition @entity93 .			0

@entity10 device expected to have a screen of eight inches
will go head - to - head with @entity70 7 in the pocket tablet market
launch expected in *october*
