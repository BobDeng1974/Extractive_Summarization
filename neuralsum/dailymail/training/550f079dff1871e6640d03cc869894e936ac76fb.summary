by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 10:57 est , 24 may 2013 wearing lycra has long been considered a crime against fashion			0
but cyclist @entity4 was surprised when he was stopped by police who pulled him over for not sporting the stretchy fabric			1
an officer considered mr @entity4 ’s preferred outfit of scruffy jeans and a t - shirt not to be the attire of a serious cyclist – and thought he must have stolen the high - end bicycle he was riding			1
pulled over : @entity4 was accused of stealing his bike when the police officer saw that he was n't wearing expensive cycling clothes @entity19 @entity18 , of @entity20 , explained that because mr @entity4 was not clad in @entity1 or wearing a cycling helmet , he was likely to have pinched the £ 500 bike			1
but after checking the serial number on the bicycle which confirmed it did belong to mr @entity4 , the officer sent him on his way			1
the 25 - year - old cyclist then tweeted a picture of the incident in @entity30 , @entity31 , writing : ‘ just got stopped by the police for ‘ ‘ not wearing @entity1 ’ ’ but being on a road bike			1
he says i was n’t dressed in appropriate gear for riding my bike so i had stolen it			1
’ he went on : ‘ i was clipped in			0
no scruffy trainers but clean ( ish ) shoes			0
‘ maybe i did not look hipster enough ? apparently there have been some shed break - ins locally			0
the bike looks too good for me to own , obviously ! ‘ it is nice to see them looking out for pinched bikes , i told the policeman i appreciated it			2
’ lycra : because @entity4 was n't wearing expensive cycling clothing , the police officer assumed that he was not the owner of the bike explaining his actions @entity19 @entity18 later said : ‘ bike thefts are a priority for us in this area as we ’ve had a number of garage and shed break - ins			1
‘ i ’m a cyclist myself and it was unusual to see an expensive bike being ridden by someone in non-cycling clothes and without a helmet			2
’ he continued : ‘ it soon became clear that mr @entity4 was the genuine owner and i ’m glad he ’s supportive of what we ’re doing to try to catch bike thieves			1
’ mr @entity4 later told his followers on @entity74 that he found the experience amusing , writing : ‘ i thanked them for stopping me			1
i was just amused at the reasoning being that i was n’t @entity1 - clad			1
‘ i do n’t think it needs a complaint against @ @entity80			0
i ’m not wearing normal attire and it probably looked dodgy			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s fair enough			2
i ’m not saying they were wrong			0
it ’s amusing that i ’ve been stopped for no lycra			0
jeans and a tee are so last season			0
’ @entity1 is a relative newcomer to the textile scene , having been invented in 1959 by chemists at @entity90 in @entity91			2
it was marketed under the trademark spandex – a play on the words ‘ it expands ’ and quickly became essential cycling gear			0
its association with the sport has resulted in the nickname ‘ @entity102 ’ for aggressive cyclists			0
portly weekend riders have popularised the acronym ‘ @entity105 ’ – @entity106 in @entity1 , a common sight on @entity109 ’s roads .			2

@entity4 was pulled over in @entity111 as he was n't dressed appropriately
@entity19 thought that he may have stolen his fixed gear bike as he had no @entity1
@entity4 was *shocked* but added that he was glad police were looking into cycle thefts
