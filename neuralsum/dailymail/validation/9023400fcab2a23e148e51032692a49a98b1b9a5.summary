after months of defending @entity4 's work , the late @entity2 singer 's family breathed a sigh of relief in court on tuesday as a jury decided that the @entity10 song ' @entity11 ' ripped off @entity4 's 1977 hit ' @entity12 '			1
following the decision , @entity4 's ex-wife and children sat down for interviews to describe the emotional legal battle to stand up for his music and how they hold no ill - feelings towards the song 's producer , @entity22			1
' it 's gratifying , i just felt filled , ' ex-wife @entity4 told @entity26			2
from left to right : @entity4 's son @entity35 , daughter @entity36 , and ex-wife @entity4 overcome with emotion : tears welled in @entity36 's eyes as she reflected on the multi-million dollar lawsuit the success of the family 's lawsuit in court is also sparking discussion online as to whether some of @entity22 's other work infringed on @entity4 , with many drawing comparisons between his 2013 hit ' happy ' and @entity4 's ' @entity50 '			1
' i 'm not going to lie			0
i do think they sound alike , ' @entity4 's 40 - year - old daughter @entity36 told @entity53			1
while the family hears the similarities , they say they are not interested in going back to court anytime soon			0
' we 're not in that space , ' @entity36 added			2
furthermore , the @entity61 are open to mending ties with @entity22 , and said they would be willing to include him in a tribute show to the late @entity66 star			0
in court on tuesday , @entity36 cried in court as a jury decided to award her family $ 4million in damages and $ 3.4 million in profits from the song			1
@entity10 will be forced to pay $ 1.7million from his own pocket and @entity22 $ 1.6million			1
got to give it up : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity22 ( right ) are seen leaving court last week during the trial			2
they were not present when the decision was read on thursday ' i feel free , free from ... @entity22 ’ & @entity10 ’s chains , ' said @entity36 in an emotional statement outside the courtroom following the verdict on tuesday the verdict could tarnish the legacy of @entity22 , a reliable hit - maker who has won @entity86 and appears on @entity88 's music competition show @entity89			1
it was previously revealed that the song had made a staggering $ 16million for @entity22 , @entity10 , rapper @entity92 and the record company , though @entity92 and various record and music companies had previously been cleared of copyright infringement charges			1
an attorney for @entity10 and @entity22 has said a decision in favor of @entity4 's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist 's sound			1
all three later released a statement , saying ; ' while we respect the judicial process , we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today , which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward			0
' @entity11 ’ was created from the heart and minds of @entity22 , @entity10 and @entity92 and not taken from anyone or anywhere else			1
we are reviewing the decision , considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter			0
' ' right now , i feel free , ' an emotional @entity36 said after the verdict			2
' free from ... @entity22 and @entity10 's chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told			1
' tragic death : @entity4 , best known for such classics as @entity132 , @entity130 ( to be loved by you ) , was tragically murdered by his father when he was just 44 - years - old this was no doubt in response to the fact that @entity22 and @entity10 had filed a lawsuit against @entity4 's estate back in august 2013 in an attempt to stop his family from suing them for copyright infringement			1
' plaintiffs , who have the utmost respect for and admiration of @entity4 , @entity150 and their musical legacies , reluctantly file this action in the face of multiple adverse claims from alleged successors in interest to those artists			0
defendants continue to insist that plaintiffs ' massively successful composition , ' @entity11 , ' copies ' their ' compositions , ' read the suit			0
this suit however was thrown out in october of that year , when a judge ruled that the family had made a sufficient showing that the two songs were similar			0
' we did not start this fight … @entity22 and @entity10 started this lawsuit , ” @entity171 said outside of the courthouse			2
' we fought this fight with one arm tied behind our back			0
' victory speech : @entity36 ( second from left ) , daughter of late singer @entity4 , and her lawyer @entity171 ( front right ) speak to the media following the verdict on tuesday the @entity183 ' lawyer branded @entity22 and @entity10 liars who went beyond trying to emulate the sound of @entity4 's late - 1970s music and copied the @entity66 legend 's hit got to give it up outright			1
he also brought up the fact after the verdict that the defense 's legal team did everything they could to stop the jury from hearing @entity4 's song during the proceedings , allowing them to just listen to certain snippets of the music			1
for this reason the infringement charge only applied to the sheet music for the two songs , making the case against @entity10 and @entity22 that much more difficult for the @entity4 family			1
@entity171 however pointed out during his argument that @entity10 said in interviews while promoting the single that he and @entity22 were trying to write something like @entity4 's @entity12			1
@entity10 told jurors he did n't write @entity11 , which @entity22 testified he crafted in about an hour in mid- 2012 , as he was too high on painkillers and alcohol			1
' the biggest hit of my career was written by somebody else , and i was jealous and wanted credit , ' said @entity10			0
he also took time on the stand to play a variety of songs that sound similar in music and tone in an attempt to strengthen his case @entity22 told jurors that @entity4 's music was part of the soundtrack of his youth , but the seven - time @entity86 winner said he did n't use any of it to create @entity11 and that the songs were alike in genre only			1
the pair 's lawyer maintained their innocence even after the verdict , saying ; ' they 're unwavering in their absolute conviction that they wrote this song independently			2
' heads held high : @entity171 , far left , walks with the late singer , @entity4 's family members , from left , daughter , @entity36 , ex-wife , @entity247 , and son , @entity248 , on tuesday according to the @entity250 , he song brought in $ 5.6 million for @entity10 , $ 5.2 million for @entity22 and another $ 5 million to $ 6 million for the record company , as well as an additional $ 8 million in publishing revenue @entity4 's children - @entity36 , @entity248 and @entity35 - sued the singers in 2013 and were present when the verdict was read			1
the family had initially asked for $ 40million in damages , but later lowered that number to $ 25million			0
this was based on the amount of money they believed @entity4 would have been paid had he signed off on the rights to his song			2
@entity4 's ex-wife @entity266 testified that as soon as she heard the song she recognized the similarities and was thrilled thinking that this would introduce the music of her late husband to a new generation of music lovers			1
that quickly turned to anger however when she learned the rights to @entity4 's song had not been licensed			1
sales of the 2013 song , which has already sold 7.3million copies in the @entity280 alone , are still going strong too , and have seen a drastic increase over the course of the trial this past few weeks			0
@entity4 , best known for such classics as @entity132 , @entity130 ( to be loved by you ) , was tragically murdered by his father as he tried to break up a fight between his parents and protect his mother in 1984			2
the singer , just 44 - years - old at the time , had been nominated for 14 @entity86 at that point over the course of his brilliant but all too brief career , and left the rights to all his music to his three children			0
an appeal of the ruling is already being considered by @entity22 and @entity10 's lawyer			2
@entity301 vs. @entity301 : @entity301 's monster hit @entity303 , a song which earned him three @entity86 at this year 's ceremony while also contributing to his @entity307 victory , sounded a little to similar to the @entity308 , something the latter 's lawyers picked up on and took to court			0
the two settled the entire thing like gentlemen however , coming to an agreement out of court that gives @entity301 and composer @entity316 a writing credit on the track and 12.5 % of the royalties			0
the @entity320 : the @entity321 became one of the biggest bands of 1999 thanks to their hit @entity325 , a song which sampled strings from the @entity329 's @entity328			0
the band however was told they could only use a five - note sample , and once they song was released were accused of breaking their promise and using more			0
as a result , @entity336 and @entity337 were given writing credits for the track alongside @entity321 's @entity341 , and the group had to relinquish all royalties they received for the song			0
@entity345 and @entity346 : while @entity346 remains a one - hit wonder , that hit , @entity348 , still receives massive play over 20 years after it was released by the rapper			0
the song clearly borrowed however from the @entity346 and @entity345 tune @entity354 , something the rapper initially denied			0
the case was eventually settled out of court , and the details of the settlement were never revealed , though it is known that @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 and @entity346 all now have songwriting credits			0
@entity365 : in the biggest copyright infringement case prior to tuesday 's ruling , @entity366 was accused of using the @entity370 song he 's @entity371 in creating his solo song @entity373			2
the case dragged on for five years , ultimately making its way to a @entity280 federal court , where @entity366 lost and was forced to pay $ 1,599,987 , a staggering amount at the time			0
@entity380 vs. @entity379 : @entity381 used elements of the @entity380 song @entity383 in his song of the same name , and as a result ended up having to pay $ 5.4million , when the case went to court , which before tuesday was the largest amount ever awarded in a copyright infringement case .			2

on tuesday , a jury awarded the family of @entity4 $ *7.4million* in their lawsuit against @entity22 and @entity10
@entity4 's children @entity36 , @entity248 and @entity35 sued the singers in 2013 saying they stole the music to @entity11 from their father
following the verdict , the family spoke out in interview , saying they hold no *grudge* against @entity22 and are n't *planning* further suits
@entity10 told jurors he did n't write @entity11 , which @entity22 testified he crafted in about an hour in mid- 2012
the song made a staggering $ 16million for @entity22 , @entity10 and rapper @entity92
