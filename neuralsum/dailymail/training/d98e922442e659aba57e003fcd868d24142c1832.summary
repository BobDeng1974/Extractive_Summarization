the 90 - year - old , who became @entity2 's manager , addressed @entity7 via video link from @entity9 the woman 's testimony is not on the charge sheet because of where and when the alleged incident took place , but she was called as a supporting witness by the prosecution			1

today , his brother told jurors that he accompanied him to a television studio in @entity22 where the incident was alleged to have taken place , and said of the woman 's claims : ' that 's ridiculous			1
he would never do that and i would n't let him do that , and he knew i would n't let him do that			0
' that 's just not possible			0
' the freelancer , who was in her 20s at the time , said he repeatedly put his hands inside her baggy shorts as far as her hips while making a programme in @entity22 in the mid- 1980s			1
but @entity6 said : ' i would have shouted at him , i would have demanded that he stopped			2
but it never happened , it would never have been something that he would have done			0
' i would have taken the elder brother approach to a younger brother misbehaving			2
' the former advertising boss said he had never seen @entity2 behaving inappropriately towards anyone			1
‘ i ’ve never had any problems with that at all , ’ he told the jury			0
' i ’ve never seen him do anything unpleasant to anybody really			0
@entity2 arrived at court today accompanied by his daughter , @entity75 , left , and niece , @entity77 , right ‘ certainly i watched him perform with children - he and i had started a series of programmes over the years called @entity83 , where there were literally hundreds and hundreds of children			2
‘ he worked with them and was always very likeable and helpful in helping the children to perform			0
‘ never did he do anything to cause any problems			0
’ one alleged victim , @entity90 , who has waived her right to anonymity , claimed @entity2 touched her intimately when she met him while touring @entity93 with an @entity22 youth theatre group			1

he said he called the theatre group 's artistic director , @entity124 , to ask her whether she had seen what allegedly happened			1
' in retrospect i kept on niggling away at her , saying " surely you must have seen something " , ' he said			0
' in @entity90 ’s documentary she went into great detail about what happened over a period of time , and i thought that @entity124 must have seen something of this			2
so i kept trying to see			0
i did n’t put any pressure on her			0
' he went on : ' i was n’t trying to get her to change her story , if that ’s what you mean , i was trying to see whether she could back up what this girl was saying			0
' under cross-examination by prosecutor @entity151 , he admitted that in the ' hypothetical ' situation that ms @entity124 had supported the claims , he would not have told the police			2
he said : ' i ’m protective of my brother and i also wanted to see if there was any truth to what was being said			0
i did n’t believe it			0
' the jury has already heard that ms @entity124 could not be certain about what happened on the night of the alleged assault , and that speaking to @entity24 she claimed she ' felt pressured to say that it could n’t have taken place '			1
@entity6 repeatedly denied trying to influence her , and said if his brother had performed for the theatre group while they were having dinner together , he would have been most focused on doing his show			1
' i ca n’t believe if he had done a show like that he would have had time or been bothered to do the kind of things that @entity90 has said , ' he told the court			2
later , a retired tour manager who worked with @entity2 in the 1980s told the court how the entertainer was always ' quiet and nervous ' before he went on stage			1
@entity179 , who was also speaking from @entity22 , said : ' @entity2 was quiet and rather nervous			2
