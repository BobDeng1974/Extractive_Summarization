the moment a flaming meteorite shot across the @entity3 night sky has been captured by a police car			1
stunned traffic officers spotted the ‘ bolide ’ meteor as they travelled on the @entity8 in the @entity9 at 03:00 bst on monday			1
the clip released by @entity11 shows the bright white flash of light hurtling across the sky in front on their vehicle			0
the video was taken from a camera on the front of one of the force ’s traffic cars as it left @entity24 of the motorway near @entity26			1
posting the footage on their @entity29 account , @entity11 said : ' we ’re used to catching suspects on camera but on mon we recorded this meteor fireball in the sky over @ m42motorway			1
' there is no official definition of a bolide , but it is generally taken to be a fireball			0
it comes from the @entity42 ' bolis ' , which means missile			0
particularly bright meteors , such as the one spotted in the @entity3 today , that burn up in the atmosphere are generally regarded as bolides			1
fireballs that explode in the upper atmosphere are also known as bolides			0
bolides that reach exceptional brightness are known as superbolides			0
experts said the meteor was spotted over the @entity56 , @entity57 and the @entity9 in the early hours of monday morning			1
the rock broke into pieces as it entered the earth ’s atmosphere but did not cause any damage			1
spotting meteors like this is rare in the @entity3 and astronomers said catching one on camera is a huge achievement			1
the incredible sight was also captured by two cameras operated by the @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73			1
this is the moment a flaming meteorite was captured shooting across the @entity3 night sky - from a camera in a police car			1
the meteorite is visible at about the 12.30 position in this image			0

the video was taken from a camera on the front of one of the force 's traffic cars as it left @entity24 of the @entity8 near @entity26 @entity105 , of the @entity3 @entity106 , said it was by far the largest fireball ever spotted by the observatory			1
he added : ' we have two cameras that watch for meteors during darkness , so upon hearing the news i logged in to check our data and see if we had captured anything			0
' fortunately the meteor passed in front of both of our cameras so we ended up with two videos of the same event			1
' due to cloud and raindrops on the camera lenses the image was not as clear as we would like , however the sheer size and brightness of this object burning up in our atmosphere almost overwhelmed our cameras as it was so bright			1
' the dashcam video was taken from a camera on the front of one of the force 's traffic cars as it left @entity24 of the @entity8 near @entity26 in the early hours of monday morning the discovery was first made by cameras at the @entity71 in @entity141 , @entity73 at 03:04 bst on monday			1
events such as this in the @entity3 are rare , so spotting one on camera is a huge achievement			2
some eyewitnesses are reported to have said it was green in colour , and it was said to even cast shadows due to its brightness			0
astronomers at the @entity71 in @entity141 heard reports that a massive shooting star had been spotted streaking across the sky in the early hours			1
they rewound the observatory ’s two fixed cameras and were thrilled to find a perfect clip of a flaming meteor arcing across the sky at 3:04 before disappearing behind clouds			2
built in 1912 and situated 15 miles south of @entity164 , the @entity71 is used by students , researchers and amateur astronomers			0
thanks to its coastal location and the lack of light pollution , it is renowned as one of the best places in the @entity3 for spectral analysis			2
a meteor has been spotted streaking over skies of the @entity3			1
it was caught on two camera operated by the @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , shown here in this still from a video			2
it did not cause any damage but shows how vulnerable our planet can be to space rocks such as asteroids and comets this meteor comes on the 106th anniversary of the tunguska event			1
on 30 june 1908 a giant explosion occurred over the @entity193 in @entity194 , believed to have been caused by an asteroid or comet exploding in the atmosphere			0
it flattened 770 square miles ( 2,000 square kilometres ) of forest ( picture taken in 1929 ) meteors that enter our atmosphere often undergo this intense event as they are heated during re-entry			2
on occasion rocks make it all the way through and impact the ground , forming craters			2
more often than not though the debris merely burns up in the atmosphere , in some cases as a super-heated fireball known as a bolide			2
some even explode in the upper atmosphere and , if they ’re big enough , can cause widespread damage like the tunguska event 106 years ago			2
on 30 june 1908 a giant explosion occurred over the @entity193 in @entity194 , believed to have been caused by an asteroid or comet exploding in the atmosphere			0
the tunguska event , as it would be known , flattened 770 square miles ( 2,000 square kilometres ) of forest			0
and on its 106th anniversary the @entity3 has experienced a tunguska event of its own , albeit on a much smaller scale			1
an asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system			0
most are located between @entity236 and @entity237 in the @entity238			0
a comet is a rock covered in ice , methane and other compounds			0
their orbits take them much further out of the solar system			0
a meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up			2
this debris itself is known as a meteoroid			0
most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere			0
if any of this meteoroid makes it to @entity263 , it is called a meteorite			0
@entity265 , meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets .			0

new footage of the meteor that streaked across the @entity3 has been revealed
@entity274 was captured by a police car on monday morning near @entity26
the meteor was first spotted by an observatory in @entity141 , @entity73
the explosive fireball was seen in the early hours of monday morning
it became extremely bright high up in the atmosphere after burning up
it then broke up into pieces due to the heat before damaging nearby ground
it came on the 106th anniversary of @entity294 meteor impact event
