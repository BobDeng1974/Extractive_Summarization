fashionable anti-cancer superfoods and supplements do not prevent the disease and may even cause it , according to a scientist who helped discover the structure of @entity5			0
@entity6 said the cure for many cancers will remain elusive unless scientists rethink the role of antioxidants , which include vitamin pills and food such as blueberries and broccoli			1
it is widely believed they boost health and fight cancer by mopping up oxygen molecules called free radicals			1
but dr @entity6 argues these may be key to preventing and treating cancer – and depleting the body of them may be counter-productive			1
counter productive ? it is widely believed foods such as blueberries , left , and broccoli , right , help boost health and fight cancer by mopping up oxygen molecules called free radicals free radicals not only help keep diseased cells under control , they are also pivotal in making many cancer drugs , as well as radiotherapy , effective , he believes			1
writing in a journal published by the @entity43 , the 84 - year - old @entity41 laureate stated that antioxidants ‘ may have caused more cancers than they have prevented ’			1
‘ for as long as i have been focused on the curing of cancer , well - intentioned individuals have been consuming antioxidative nutritional supplements as cancer preventatives , if not actual therapies , ’ he said			2
‘ in light of recent data strongly hinting that much of late - stage cancer ’s untreatability may arise from its possession of too many antioxidants , the time has come to seriously ask whether antioxidant use much more likely causes than prevents cancer			1
’ he said a vast number of studies had found antioxidants including vitamins a , @entity68 and @entity69 and the mineral selenium , to have ‘ no obvious effectiveness ’ in preventing stomach cancer or in lengthening life			2
instead , they seem to slightly shorten the lives of those who take them , and vitamin e may be particularly dangerous			0
the @entity79 , who describes his theory as among his most important work since the @entity5 breakthrough with @entity84 colleague @entity83 in 1953 , said blueberries may taste good but give no protection against cancer			2
the study by @entity89 , based at the @entity90 in @entity91 , is published in the journal @entity93			0
he has caused uproar in the past with his opinions on race , intelligence , beauty and homosexuality			0
professor @entity102 , of @entity103 , agreed that studies showed antioxidants were ineffective for cancer prevention in healthy people and can even slightly increase the risk of the disease			0
he said vitamins and minerals should be obtained through a healthy and balanced diet .			0

it is widely believed that superfoods like blueberries and broccoli help fight cancer by defending against oxygen molecules called free radicals
dr @entity6 has now said such free radicals may be key to preventing and treating cancer
the 84 - year - old @entity41 laureate has said antioxidants ' may have caused more cancers than they have prevented '
