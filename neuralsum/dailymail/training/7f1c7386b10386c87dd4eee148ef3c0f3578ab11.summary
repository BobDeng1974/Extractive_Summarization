by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 is ready to make an impact following his £ 16million move to @entity6 ... on @entity9 forwards ' shins that is			1
the @entity11 defender sealed his switch from @entity13 on wednesday and will add much - needed steel to @entity6 's brittle defence , which was breached twice on the opening day of the season in a miserable defeat against @entity19			1
a quick glance at @entity3 's disciplinary statistics from his time in @entity23 reveal a player not afraid to get stuck in to the opposition - whether within the rules of the game or outside of them			1
not only that , @entity3 also saw red in the @entity23 cup against @entity47 making it five reds in two seasons at @entity13			1
the 24 - year - old from @entity52 also gave a hint of what was to come for @entity9 referees when he collected his second yellow card of the @entity36 in the last - 16 win over @entity58			0
@entity3 took down @entity59 to earn himself a booking which would rule him out of the quarter - final against @entity32			0
the left back 's absence from that match does not seem to have concerned @entity64 , who was able to scout @entity3 first - hand as @entity67 manger in the semi-final			2
but if @entity3 is suspended for , say , @entity6 's visit to @entity71 on march 21 then the @entity69 might think differently			1
@entity6 were forced to field 20 - year - old @entity72 at centre half and @entity74 at left back during the defeat by @entity19 , such is the paucity of top - class options available to @entity78			0
supporters will hope that @entity3 's signing will ensure their new boss does not need to expose such a makeshift defence again			2
over the top : @entity85 forward @entity84 gets a clattering from @entity3 at the @entity88 last season @entity3 could be the latest in a long line of @entity91 hard men to have left their own stud marks on the game			0
in recent years @entity94 was a fans ' favourite at @entity97 , while @entity98 became a fearsome figure in @entity101 's midfield			0
no @entity103 fan will forget @entity105 's role in @entity11 's midfield at the @entity36 in 1998 , and the nation 's reputation for dirty play was cemented during the vicious @entity36 quarter - final defeat by the @entity103 at @entity111 in 1966			2
further evidence of @entity3 's hot - headedness came when he refused to train at @entity13 in a bid to force through his move to @entity6			1
the message was loud and clear : do n't mess with me			0
@entity9 strikers take note : this one could be a real @entity32			0
* @entity3 was also shown one red card in a @entity23 cup match			2

@entity3 has signed for @entity6 for £ 16m
@entity11 defender 's *discipinary* record reveals a *feisty* player
@entity3 collected four red cards in two seasons at @entity13
