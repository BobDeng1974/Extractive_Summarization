by @entity0 for the @entity1 for all @entity4 ’s attacking flair last season , there were times when the cavalier approach bordered on the naive and a certain fragility was apparent			1
we need only think back to the last time @entity13 side ’s faced monday night 's opponents on that emotional afternoon in april			1
@entity14 won 3 - 2 because @entity4 were too open and were torn to pieces in a scorching first half			2
ultimately , it did not matter			0
as @entity14 stumbled in the title race , @entity4 pulled away			2
it was , however , an instructive afternoon for @entity13 , who will also be concerned that @entity4 last season lost home and away to @entity21 and failed to win at @entity22			1
it is those results that perhaps persuaded @entity4 to push through a £ 12million deal for @entity31 ’s @entity26 , after almost sealing a move in january			1
@entity13 favours adventurous football but the acquisition of @entity26 suggests we may see a cuter city this season			1
@entity4 will now have muscularity to complement the elegance			2
@entity4 already boast @entity23 and @entity48 in central positions but there was a suspicion that at times they neglected their defensive duties			1
now , @entity4 could field a three - man midfield with @entity26 , providing greater protection in front of the defence			1
@entity23 sees his new team - mate as a positive addition			0
‘ @entity26 is a big signing for us , ’ he said			0
‘ the club is not just thinking about defending the title but also the @entity63			0
‘ our target is to reach the @entity63 final and i ’m sure he can help us do it			0
whether it is me , @entity48 or @entity26 who plays , we have the quality to win the @entity63			2
’ attacking force : he will be hoping to complement the creative talents of @entity48 in @entity4 's midfield competition : and he will likely be challenging fellow @entity75 @entity23 for the second central rol @entity13 may opt to experiment for the first time with all three in the same midfield tonight			1
@entity23 , though available , is also still working towards full fitness after returning late from the @entity79 , so if @entity13 plays with only two in there , he may a face a battle with compatriot @entity26 for a starting place			1
‘ that does n’t matter , ’ said @entity23			0
‘ if he plays one game , i can play another , and sometimes we can play together			0
’ the @entity75 did not know each other before @entity26 ’s arrival but have hit it off			2
@entity23 added : ‘ we have worked and lived together and done things socially			0
i told him to find a house near me			0
he is like me , calm and quiet			0

new man @entity26 will be hope to add muscularity to @entity4 's midfield
@entity13 's side caught out at times last season in centre of the park
@entity26 will be competing with fellow @entity75 @entity23 for a role
both will hope to complement the attacking talents of @entity48
