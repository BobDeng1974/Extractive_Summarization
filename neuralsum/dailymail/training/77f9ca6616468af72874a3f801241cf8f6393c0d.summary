click here for our brilliant @entity1 including @entity4 's stunning free - kick order and progress it says on the @entity9 flag			1
it ’s impossible not to avoid the green , yellow and blue colours which decorate this vast country from the bunting in the streets to the paint on the faces of children			0
on friday night , there was progress into the last four , thanks to an early strike by @entity22 and a delicious free - kick by @entity4 , but there was very little order in evidence , at least not on the pitch			1
the game was a frantic spectacle where hearts ruled heads , unleashed like a 90 - minute sugar - rush			0
it could have been a runaway home win or quite easily another tear - jerker for the host nation , as @entity36 summoned a noble finish			1
ultimately , the progress of @entity40 ’s team into the last four of the @entity41 will ensure order on the cities of @entity44 , and that may be for the best			1

the fears and anxieties of 200 million people are soothed for the time being			0
@entity36 have added rhythm and flair to this tournament but could not overcome the collective will inside @entity66 ’s @entity155 , a collective will which at times , it has to be said , seemed to include the officials			2
before the game , @entity160 fans suspected they would not be allowed to win ; a feeling reinforced when they had a goal by @entity118 controversially ruled out for offside when 1 - 0 down			2
no - one was off when @entity118 shot , but there was a marginal call earlier in the sequence which unfolded from a free - kick			1
referee @entity145 could not avoid awarding them a penalty , however , when @entity95 completely wiped - out substitute @entity172 and @entity84 scored , his sixth of the @entity41			1
it made for a tense finish			0
@entity44 clung on , although not without collateral damage			2
@entity22 is out of the semi-final against @entity178 after a yellow card and @entity46 was carried off late in the game after falling awkwardly			1
as it is , @entity36 ’s 23 - year winless run against their neighbours goes on , and so does @entity44 ’s @entity184 beat			1
@entity40 ’s players collapsed at the final whistle and raised their hands to the sky			0
they must be on the brink of nervous exhaustion but into the semi-finals they go			0
that it should be @entity22 who struck first was a sweet twist in the narrative of the campaign			2
he caught @entity121 napping at the back post to turn in with his left knee a corner won and delivered by @entity46			2
less than seven minutes were gone and @entity44 had the nerve - settler of an early lead but , just as they in the previous round against @entity204 , they were unable to make it count			2
nerves would still be in shreds by the final whistle			0
making a point : @entity4 and @entity107 console a tearful @entity84 at the full - time whistle commiserations : @entity4 puts his arm around @entity84 as @entity97 also consoles the @entity36 wideman disallowed : @entity118 put the ball in the net for @entity36 but the strike was ruled out by the referee not impressed : @entity118 and fellow @entity36 defender @entity119 scream at the referee 's decision tough tackler : @entity98 and fellow midfielder @entity120 both slide to challenge for the ball high foot : @entity98 attempts to rob the ball from the boot of @entity36 's @entity84 late : @entity84 goes flying following @entity98 's challenge but the @entity9 protests his innocence still , after a week of questions , it was impossible not to share @entity22 ’s relief			1
off he ran to the opposite corner flag , beating his chest , soon to be mobbed by delirious team - mates as the roof lifted off the @entity77 , freed by a rapid response to a week of debate in @entity44 , when some claimed he should be stripped of the captaincy			2
emotions had got the better of him in against @entity204 and his ability to focus was questioned but here his mind was clear			0
he intercepted a cross and twice hurled his body in the line of shots from @entity122			0
when @entity84 slipped @entity98 and @entity36 threatened to swamp @entity44 in the first half , who was on the edge of the penalty area , winning back the ball ? it was the captain			1
@entity36 ’s greatest threat came from @entity84 , drifting into spaces behind @entity126 and @entity44 were without @entity253 , who was banned			1
agony : @entity46 screams in pain on the floor after being fouled deep into the second - half up and over : the @entity36 wall jumps in an attempt to stop @entity46 's free - kick for @entity44 head over heels : @entity46 fails in his attempt to stop the ball from going out of play with his head painful : @entity46 reacts after being challenged by @entity36 midfielder @entity121 eyes wide shut : @entity44 playmaker @entity100 looks on as @entity124 climbs highest to head the ball on calm down , lads ! @entity271 referee @entity145 intervenes to stop an argument from ensuing aerial duel : goalscorer @entity22 gets the better of @entity36 frontman @entity124 in the air on the march : @entity36 frontman @entity84 marauds forward as three @entity9 watch on @entity98 started well , winning the ball and passing it well , both long and short			1
it was the @entity278 midfielder who unzipped @entity36 and released @entity46 to win the corner for the first goal			1
he did n’t always have @entity84 under control , although that is no disgrace			0
few people in this tournament have contained him			0
@entity98 did it well , and he was making crucial tackles deep in stoppage time			0
at times , referee @entity290 was too lenient			0
@entity84 was targeted , and then booked when he made his first foul , one which led the free - kick scored by @entity4 from 30 yards			1
@entity142 ’s side leave with credit			0
they refused to roll over after their early setback in a suffocating atmosphere with the game locked in a frantic tempo , pinging back and forth like table - tennis			0
a break by @entity4 summed everything up			0
charging up - field the over-lapping centre - half seemed set on a slalom wonder - goal , only to lose the ball to @entity117 and hurtle back in pursuit of the full - back , head back , hair trailing , until he had landed a little physical contact after the ball had moved on			2
the crowd cheered but and the @entity36 bench leapt to their feet in fury but the breathless game had moved on			0
@entity4 is incredibly popular and will probably be captain on tuesday in @entity22 ’s absence , but he flexes between pure majesty and total liability			1
where he goes , chaos usually follows , but what a free - kick he fired into the top corner to settle the game			1
hanging on : @entity36 defender @entity118 puts his arms around @entity44 frontman @entity104 in the area bend it like @entity84 : the @entity36 winger curls a free - kick towards goal but @entity46 jumps in the way to block tussle : @entity44 frontman @entity102 and @entity36 wideman @entity122 do battle for the ball out wide strong : @entity44 defender @entity4 charges past @entity36 centre back @entity118 hanging in the air : @entity46 brings the ball down under control during the first - half of friday 's clash talking tactics : @entity4 whispers behind his hand to former @entity346 team - mate @entity100 thumbs up : @entity44 boss @entity40 acknowledges one of his players from the touchline			1

@entity44 progress to the semi-finals of the @entity41 with 2 - 1 *victory* over @entity354 rivals @entity36
@entity22 opened the scoring for host nation before @entity4 netted stunning free - kick
@entity360 man @entity46 was taken off on a stretcher with a back injury and looks set to miss the rest of the tournament
@entity84 scored a consolation for @entity36 from the penalty spot
