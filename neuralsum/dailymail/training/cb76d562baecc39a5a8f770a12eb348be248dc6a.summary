lord @entity0 said older people had to stop being a ' negative burden on the state ' the elderly should earn their pensions by doing voluntary work in their communities to avoid being a ‘ burden on the state ’ , a retired mandarin has suggested			1
@entity0 , formerly head of the @entity12 , made the controversial suggestion at a @entity15 discussion on how to meet the costs of @entity18 ’s ageing population			1
last night his plans were branded ‘ @entity21 for the over- 60s ’ by angry pensioner groups			1
the cross-bench peer , a former permanent secretary at the @entity25 , retired from the civil service at just 53			0
his taxpayer - funded pension is estimated to be £ 120,000 a year			0
@entity0 , 65 , drew a parallel between the workshy claiming unemployment benefits and retirees drawing their pensions			1
he said : ‘ we are now prepared to say to people who are not looking for work , if you do n’t look for work you do n’t get benefits			0
so if you are old and you are not contributing in some way or another , maybe there is some penalty attached to that			0
’ he called for ‘ imaginative ’ ideas such as making old people care for the very old			0
lord @entity0 added : ‘ are we using all of the incentives at our disposal to encourage older people not just to be a negative burden on the state but actually be a positive part of society ? ‘ it is quite possible , for example , to envisage a world where civil society is making a greater contribution to the care of the very old , and older people who are not very old could be making a useful contribution to civil society in that respect , if they were given some incentive or some recognition for doing so			1
’ he later pledged to investigate the idea further as part of his work for the @entity68 and @entity69			0
@entity0 , who led the inquiry into the @entity72 murders , said it would be difficult for politicians to sell to the public , but added : ‘ so was tuition fees			1
’ pensioner groups reacted with fury at the suggestion that the elderly should have to ‘ earn ’ their pension after a lifetime of working and contributing taxes			0
lord @entity0 wants a system where civil society is making a ' greater contribution to the care of the very old ' @entity88 , general secretary of the @entity89 , said : ‘ this amounts to little more than @entity21 for the over- 60s and is absolutely outrageous			1
‘ those who have paid their national insurance contributions for 30 or more years are entitled to receive their state pension and there should be no attempt to put further barriers in their way			2
‘ we already have one of the lowest state pensions in @entity102 and one in five older people in @entity18 live below the poverty line			1
‘ @entity0 ’s comments are also extremely divisive – trying to pitch younger people against older people – when the truth is that the real division in our society is between rich and poor			1
the general secretary of the @entity89 said nothing should be put in the way of retirees receiving their pension frankly , @entity0 needs to think twice before making such silly and ill - informed remarks			2
’ @entity117 , director general of the charity @entity118 , said : ‘ older people are a hugely positive part of society			1
‘ over a third of people aged between 65 and 74 volunteer , a percentage that only drops slightly for the over- 75s			2
in addition , nearly a million older people provide unpaid care to family or friends , saving the state millions of pounds			1
’ dr @entity131 , director general of @entity132 , added : ‘ this is a very strange idea indeed			0
‘ those who have retired have already made huge contributions to our society and are already the largest group of charity and community volunteers			2
‘ @entity0 ’s suggestion smacks of social engineering of a dangerous kind			1
he seems to be suggesting that if you decide to stop working , even once you reach the age that society determines it is reasonable to stop , civil servants should assess you and decide whether you are fit to be assigned to do work that they decide you should do			0
’ professor @entity149 , of @entity150 , @entity151 , a former adviser to the @entity152 , appeared to back @entity0			2
he told the committee he could not understand why young people were not taking to the streets in protest , because they were subsidising the older generation			2
he told peers : ‘ i think they should be angry			0
‘ i think the deal they are getting is poor			0
’ lord @entity149 , who is also an analyst at the @entity164 - owned @entity163 bank , said research he was carrying out at @entity150 , suggested that ‘ the current generation are very heavy contributors to the public purse , whereas previous generations have benefited from the public purse ’ .			0

@entity172 chief @entity0 says older people must stop being a ' negative burden ' on the state
pensions ' should be linked to contributions to the community as an incentive for people to look after the " very old " '
*campaigners* *condemn* the idea as ' @entity21 for the over- 60s ' which they claim ' smacks of social engineering '
