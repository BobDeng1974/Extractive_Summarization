as day two of the @entity0 gets underway , thousands of ladies dressed in outrageous or elegant outfits as they compete in the style stakes and take in some high - class racing throughout the day			1
the popular event has seen over 45,000 descend on @entity6 for the perfect build - up ahead of saturday 's main event , the @entity9			2
seven races make up the day as they saw @entity11 , ridden by @entity12 , take home the @entity14 and following up from his second place at the @entity16 at @entity17			0
@entity18 rides @entity19 and @entity20 in what is his last ever @entity0 festival , as he looks to leave the racing scene and his legacy with a bang			1
side boob alert ! some of the racegoers ended up flashing a bit more flesh than they bargained for hoping to be noticed : ms @entity30 had certainly dressed to attract the attention of photographers in her newsprint dress and scarlet heels steady ! a lady needs some help getting off @entity6 's racing simulator , but a bride - to - be had no problems hanging on glugging on the go : ladies enjoy a drink while moving through the racecourse ahead of the first race uh oh ! ms @entity30 also fell victim to the day 's first wardrobe malfunction when a breeze blew her skirt up to reveal a paucity of underwear getting the giggles : a lady chats seriously on the phone while another just ca n't hide her smile as she strolls around the course great day out : two ladies burst into peals of laughter as they enjoy their day out at @entity6 full length : floor - length dresses in summery floral print also proved a hit , with many ladies teaming them with summery sandals and relax : ladies perch on a piece of astro - turf and check their phones while enjoying a drink ladies in red : along with bridal white , cheerful crimson also struck a chord with the ladies and it proved a popular choice nice dress ! a quartet of ladies show off their stylish side as they strike a pose for photographers while making their way into the course colourful : many of the racegoers arriving for @entity89 had plumped for bold brights - red was among the favourites showing some skin : a couple of ladies opted to flash the flesh and showed off plenty of cleavage as well as a few tattoos go on ! a lady roars her horse home to victory during the second race of @entity89 at @entity6 purple reign : a lady shows off her spectacular @entity107 - inspired dress and her matching purple hat bright spark : bold colour was a popular choice for the second day in a row with bright pink and pale blue taking an early lead tenterhooks : earlier , the lady had looked nervous while watching the second race of the day , the @entity119 stripes galore : one of summer 's hottest trends is stripes - and the ladies of @entity6 were happy to make the most of it dancing queen : a lady gives the cameras a twirl while crossing the racecourse in her high heels oops ! one lady 's champagne swigging plans did n't quite go to plan and she ended up with booze splashed across her face on trend : a range of different summer trends were on show , including the ever - popular black and white ( left ) , lace ( centre ) and print ( right ) hats you win : many of the ladies arrived sporting spectacular hats , which they offset with simple dresses looking lovely : ladies sported a variety of different looks , with black and white , maxi dresses and peplums all proving popular quite the look : a lady steps out in a floor - length orange dress slashed to somewhere beyond the thigh along with low - cut dresses , the clunky platform shoes that have become a @entity0 staple in recent years were very much on show as were some unflatteringly tight get - ups			1
most , however , were simply intent on enjoying the sunshine and , in some cases , the revels with many opting to start their day with a mini bottle of champagne , quaffed with the help of a booze funnel			0
but while many joined in with the fun , the sight of so many early morning drinkers has left bookmakers panicking at the prospect of a bumper payout following @entity180 's decision to offer odds on such wardrobe malfunctions as falling over while drunk and showing off too much cleavage			0
' if some of yesterday 's outfits were anything to go by , we 're in for a treat today for @entity89 at @entity6 , ' said @entity180 's @entity189 , whose company has priced falling over at 1/2 and exposed breasts and bottoms at 2/1			2
cheers ! a pair of ladies , both in spectacular fascinators , enjoy a bottle of @entity199 champagne flashing the flesh : some of the ladies had clearly ignored the part of the style code that advises against excess cleavage time for a touch up : a lady freshens up her eye make - up from her perch on a spare bit of asphalt much better ! a lady kicks off her platform shoes and replaces them with a comfy pair of flip flops afternoon pint : some of the ladies looked content to ignore the racing and got stuck into the beer instead mwah ! two ladies pose for a selfie and manage to juggle brightly coloured cocktails at the same time good for a giggle : a cheerful pair of ladies pose for a selfie while tucking into a box of chips colourful : some ladies chose particularly bright ensembles , especially the lady on the left who combined pink hair with an orange skirt hint of flesh : some ladies opted for dresses with cut outs , although some revealed more than others bottoms up ! a pair of ladies enjoy a glass of champagne as they wait for the racing action to start making merry : a lady kicks off her heels and enjoys a sit down ( left ) while another flashes a thigh at photographers watching the action : racegoers clad in an array of cheerful summery brights watch the action unfold careful ! a lady teeters forward as she watches her horse gallop home in the second race of the day break to pose ! the ladies left drinking and sunbathing alone briefly while waving cheerfully at a passing photographer brilliant fun : a hen party appears to be making the most of their day out and make a bright splash of colour against the grey concrete getting the giggles : a lady chats seriously on the phone while another just ca n't hide her smile as she strolls around the course party ! racegoers are clearly having a great time as they share a bottle of champagne while enjoying the sunshine hello sunshine : many racegoers appeared to have dressed for august and clearly wanted to make the most of the lovely weather sunbathing : ladies huddle on a tarmac concourse as they enjoy a drink while topping up their tans first faller ! a lady 's high heels prove unequal to the task of dealing with grass - but at least she 's still smiling place your bets ! some of the ladies appeared intent on checking the latest odds on their phones ready for action : three ladies arrive for their day out at the races sporting pretty dresses in patriotic red and blue colourful : many of the guests opted for colourful ensembles , including , in one case , an impressively large feather headdress ( right ) getting stuck in : some guests opted to get the day off to a flying start with a glass or two of bubbly enjoying themselves : most of the ladies arriving were anticipating a fun day out on day two of the @entity319 's @entity318 coordinating : several couples and groups of friends opted for complementary ensembles in a wide range of hues comparing notes ? a quintet of ladies enjoy a chat as they arrive for a day 's racing at @entity6 ' with the sun shining down , we 're predicting the hemlines to shorten and the necklines to deepen so we could be in for a big payout by the end of the day if our odds are anything to go by			1
' such episodes are something @entity6 bosses had hoped to avoid this year , with the strict style code just one of a raft of measures designed to add some class to the image of the event which has suffered in recent years			0
along with expecting ' @entity350 - inspired ' get - ups from female racegoers , the management has also threatened to kick out any photographers caught taking photos of drunken racegoers			0
' our event is full of character , it ’s fun , and that ’s generated by the personality of the @entity360 people , ' said @entity6 managing director @entity361 in the run - up to this year 's event			2
' we have to absolutely protect that because it ’s at the core of what we are , and we have a responsibility to our customers to project the correct image			0
' eye - catching : a trio of brightly dressed ladies and a glamorous woman in black strike a pose for the cameras strapless : with the sun shining down on @entity6 , many of the ladies opted for bustier - style dresses having a laugh : a pair of ladies dissolve into fits of laughter as they enjoy their day in the sunshine at @entity6 dressed to the nines : a trio of racegoers show off their style nous as they arrive for a day out at @entity6 good day out : excited racegoers were clearly looking forward to their day out and were all smiles as they arrived at the racecourse lovely : many of the ladies opted for summery shades such as coral , while others kept things coordinated in navy and cream , and purple looking good : local girl @entity400 wowed onlookers in her bold pink dress and jewelled purple pumps and they 're off ! a group of ladies show off their race day looks , several complete with gorgeous cocktail hats featuring plenty of feathers having a ball : a lady looks wonderful in pink and white florals while right , a quartet of ladies blow a kiss for the cameras @entity419 mania : a quartet of ladies arrive dressed in chic all - black ensembles , with one , unusually , opting for trousers instead of the usual dress @entity425 touches : a lady , who appears to have entered the racecourse 's style competition , applies a final slick of lipstick making an entrance : a lady inspects a stall selling cut - price fascinators as she prepares to make her entrance quirky : one lady showed off a rather unique sense of style courtesy of pair of fun @entity442 - inspired heels sunshine : @entity30 strikes a pose in front of the fountain that sits at the entrance of the @entity6 racecourse final preparations : a @entity451 employee puts the finishing touches to the racecourse as the first ladies arrive			1
