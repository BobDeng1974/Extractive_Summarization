by @entity0 tourism chiefs in @entity2 have claimed the crippling lack of mobile and internet signal in rural areas is a good thing - because it is sparking ' digital detox ' holidays			1
the report by @entity11 said the ' joy of missing out ' on e-mails , texts and @entity15 is creating a generation of niche breaks devoted to the ' novelty of @entity19 ! ' but business leaders attacked the plan - pointing out visit @entity11 's own figures which say visitors complain about internet access more than any other issue			1

tourism agency @entity11 has said the lack of mobile and internet signal can be marketed as a good thing for ' digital detoxes ' ' hello ? we 're in @entity2 ! ' the idea was one of 17 trends but was criticised by business leaders the idea was listed as one of 17 ' trends for 2014 ' in a report for the taxpayer - funded body which included ' @entity43 ' ( ' embracing the past through the comforts of today ' ) , ' techspectations ' ( ' life is becoming more digital every day ' ) and ' never pay full price for pizza '			1
the report said : ' overuse of smartphones , the rejection of technology will see consumers seeking meaningful and emotional experiences			1
@entity2 ’s off - grid locations will enable this			2
signal failures : the service for mobile operator @entity60 is notably lacking in the @entity61 ' the novelty of @entity19 ! although technology is and will be a driving force for many years to come with tourism , some providers have identified a niche market for those who want to escape digital life ( albeit temporarily )			1
' @entity70 and wellbeing tourism has excelled in recent years with the use of low cost gyms , and healthy eating			2
' psychological health is also identified as an area for growth , with many providers offering packages such as " @entity81 " breaks in the @entity61 as a means of escape from everyday digital life , providing an opportunity for consumers to detach from life , and regenerate			0
' the report did admit the breaks - which were identified as something that had grown through 2013 - would not be popular with everyone			1
it added : ' although the majority of consumers would not see this as a positive aspect , many would identify @entity2 as a destination to escape and " detach " from the digital world			0
' much of @entity2 's most beautiful and isolated countryside is poorly - served by mobile phone firms			2
the @entity61 and islands are affected especially badly , because of their difficult terrain and thinly - spread population			0
in @entity11 's latest visitor report , 45 per cent of people said they had not been satisfied with internet access - more than for any other issue			1
it compared to 42 per cent who complained about the cost of travel , 41 per cent about the convenience of sea routes and 34 per cent about mobile reception			1

the @entity61 have been a popular getaway for centuries the idea has caught on among some - with one new firm , @entity127 , offering £ 299 - a - head breaks in a @entity130 cottage with strictly no screens allowed			0
the firm took a group on a ' secret ' trip to @entity135 earlier this year and plans a visit to @entity2 in may			0
but @entity137 , chief executive of the @entity138 , criticised the idea			0
' for 25 per cent of the country not to have proper mobile phone access is just not good enough for the modern day , ' he said			2
