one of the best preserved skeletons of a woolly mammoth , complete with 8ft tusks , is going up for auction			1
the 50,000 - year - old mammoth , named @entity5 , is expected to spark a fierce bidding war on wednesday 26th november , with some experts suggesting it will sell for £ 250,000 ( $ 409,000 )			1
the specimen , which is an incredible 11.4ft ( 3.5 metres ) high and 18ft ( 5.5 metres ) long , could attract bidders from both museums and private collectors			1
' this is a virtually complete mammoth skeleton with beautiful tusks , which makes it particularly rare , ' said curator @entity26			2
' imagine the mammoth covered in fur - long fur on top with a shorter undercoat - and although quite similar to today 's elephant , it had smaller ears and a shorter tail to minimise frostbite and heat loss , so it was well adapted for the ice age			1
' its habitat was the mammoth steppe , stretching across northern @entity40 and @entity41 , so its diet was mainly grass and sedges , which explains why it only had four molar teeth , and also stunning long , curved tusks			1
' rare find : @entity5 is one the best preserved skeletons of a woolly mammoth and still has his huge tusks bidding war : the specimen , which is an incredible 11.4ft ( 3.5 metres ) high and 18ft ( 5.5 metres ) long , is expected to attract bidders from both museums and private collectors @entity56 and @entity57 from @entity58 give the enormous mammoth a final dusting			1
anyone with with enough room to house this skeleton can bid for it at @entity58 in @entity21 the woolly mammoth is thought to be a male who would have weighed over six tonnes when it roamed @entity68			1
@entity69 , of @entity19 , said : ' what 's exceptional about this one is it 's more or less complete with two magnificent tusks			0
there are one or two toes missing			0
' it looks very impressive , the inside curve of the tusks is about 8ft ( 2.4 metres )			2
it 's bigger than an elephant			0
' the woolly mammoth co-existed with early humans , who hunted them for food and used their bones and tusks for making art. back from the dead ? scientists hope to bring woolly mammoths back from extinction woolly mammoths could be brought back from extinction after a preserved body of one of the ancient animals was found frozen in the snowy wastes of @entity18 , scientists hope			2
the mammoth , which took its last steps around 40,000 years ago , is in such good condition that biologists believe they may be able to clone the creature			2
an autopsy of the @entity104 beast , which has been nicknamed @entity105 by scientists , will be shown in a documentary later this month			0
the @entity109 programme will also examine pioneering work on cloning the woolly mammoth , which is taking place in @entity113 and the @entity114			2
scientists hope that , eventually , they will be able to reintroduce the huge creatures back into the wild , tens of thousands of years after they became extinct			0
@entity119 , a @entity113 geneticist , told the @entity120 : ' bringing back the mammoth either through cloning or genetic engineering would be an extremely long process			1
we 're trying hard to make this possible within our generation			0
' that 's why we have to start discussing the implications now			0
some of our colleagues are still working on analysing the genome from @entity105 's specimen			2
this is a long and complicated process that is unlikely to be finished anytime in the near future			2

' to the best of my knowledge , i do n't think there has been one sold at auction , certainly not in the @entity150 and i do n't think in @entity151 , so it 's a first in that respect , ' said mr @entity69			1
' it could either go to a museum or if you have a big conservatory it would definitely make a serious statement			0
