by @entity0 published : 11:26 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 13:44 est , 14 march 2014 having fertility treatment can be very stressful for hopeful parents , but now one clinic has found a way of making it slightly easier			1
a fertility clinic in @entity8 has created an app that allows parents - to - be to see their embryos in the lab in real - time			1
the @entity13 fertility clinic offers the service to couples who are having ivf and whose embryos are being incubated in an ‘ @entity18 ’			1
this state - of - the - art incubator contains a camera which takes a photograph of the embryo every 20 minutes for the three to five days that it is being incubated after fertilisation , and before it is transferred to the mother - to - be			1
a fertility clinic has created an app which allows hopeful parents to see their embryos developing in the lab these images can then be accessed be the parents via an app – known as ‘ @entity31 ’ - on their smartphones			1
dr @entity33 , fertility specialist at @entity13 fertility clinic , told @entity35 : ‘ this app helps parents - to - be feel close to their embryos and it makes them feel empowered			1
‘ it allows them to feel more in touch with the embryo			2
’ she added : ‘ we have had very positive feedback			0
during trials 100 per cent of people said seeing the images was very powerful and 87 per cent said it was a powerfully positive experience			2
‘ people also say it makes them feel calmer and they say it is amazing to see the creation of new life			1
the images are taken by a camera in the incubator every 20 minutes			1
they are also used by the embryologists to track which are likely to be the best quality for transfer to the mother ‘ they are amazed to be able to see their children being created and they say it makes them feel part of the process			2
’ dr @entity64 said the images are also beneficial for the embryologists as seeing how the embryo changes can allow them to detect which are of good quality and which are not			0
this allows them to select the strongest embryos for transfer to the woman , giving the best chance of a successful pregnancy			0
dr @entity64 said : ‘ most people are extremely impressed by the images – parents are watching the beginning of their child ’s life			2
’ she compared the experience to the first antenatal scan and said the average couple look at the images three or four times a day			0
dr @entity33 at the @entity13 fertility clinic ( pictured ) says the app allows parents to feel closer to their embryos and to feel part of the process one hopeful parent said : ‘ it 's definitively incredible			1
it 's an awesome view of the origin of a human life			0
i 've studied biology and my husband and me feel really rewarded and full of joy for being the witnesses of such an amazing event			0
’ another added : ‘ i have seen the creation of life and it is something very special when you know they are yours			0
’ only hopeful parents who pay an extra 500 euros to have the special incubator are able to use the app. if the embryo is successfully transferred to the woman , and the pregnancy is successful , the parents receive a dvd showing a slideshow of the images			2
the fertility clinic has also established that there is a greater chance of fertilisation if eggs in the lab are played music			2
@entity124 ( pictured ) was the first @entity125 baby to be born thanks to the technique the @entity13 fertility clinic hit the headlines last year for using a technique which sees music played to embryos while they were in a petri dish			1
the first @entity125 baby born thanks to the technique was born in 2012			0
@entity124 was played pop songs by @entity139 and @entity140 as well as tracks from @entity142 and @entity143 while in the dish			0
researchers believe the vibrations caused by the music aid fertilisation			0
the scientists found that the chance of fertilisation during @entity152 treatment is five per cent higher if music is played in the incubators .			0

the @entity13 fertility clinic in @entity157 has created ' @entity31 '
allows people to log in from their phones and see images of their embryos
they are taken every 20 minutes for the 3 to 5 days the embryo is in an incubator - means the parents can see the development in real - time
the clinic says it makes parents feel empowered and calmer
it says it also makes them feel closer to their embryos
