by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 20:32 est , 11 april 2012 she was the woman whose own tragic childhood inspired her to create the world 's most famous nanny			0
and now @entity7 ' dramatic life and her long feud with @entity9 over @entity10 , the 1964 film that catapulted her character to worldwide stardom is set to hit the big screen			1
almost 50 years ago @entity9 gave @entity15 her @entity17 debut as the magical nanny and @entity19 the chance to play one man band @entity10 , the @entity22 with the questionable accent who befriends @entity10 and the children in her care			1
but despite being one of the world 's most loved movies @entity7 vowed never to work with @entity9 again because she was so appalled by it			1
dramatic : @entity7 , pictured , and her siblings were left destitute when her alcoholic father died , inspiring her to create @entity10 she hated the script , in particular that it included the famous animated scenes and she considered that @entity15 ' @entity10 was too pretty			1
@entity7 also disapproved of the film for ignoring the harsher aspects of the nanny 's character and did not like a lot of the music			2
the new film @entity43 , starring @entity44 and @entity45 , will centre around her dramatic journey to stardom and her lesser - known battle with icon @entity9			1
born @entity7 in 1899 , she suffered an impoverished childhood , which inspired her magical stories and characters			2
her father was a banker who turned to alcohol , lost all his money and died young - it is widely considered that the character mr @entity55 was based on him			0
as a young woman she was an actress , dancer and a poet before concentrating on fiction			0
row : the 1964 movie is still loved all over the world but @entity7 never forgave @entity9 for what she thought was an appalling film anger : it was the animated scenes starring @entity15 and @entity19 that caused the author to cry throughout its premiere , which she had to sneak into ten years after leaving @entity73 for @entity74 , with little money , her first @entity10 book was published in 1934 with huge success			1
under her pen name @entity7 several other books were written but it was her own personality and life that also fascinated people			2
she never married and as a single mother adopted an @entity85 child at 40 , @entity86 , but she refused to take her child 's twin too			0
meanwhile @entity9 began a 14 - year campaign to buy the rights to the @entity10 stories and make them into a film			1
@entity9 knew her books and bombarded @entity7 with ' attention , flattery , transcontinental telegrams and visits '			2
hit : @entity7 , right , with @entity9 , centre , and @entity15 , left , but despite the huge success of the film the author disliked it greatly and refused to work with @entity9 again success : despite her tragic start in life @entity7 became an actress , pictured left in @entity107 , and right in another play in her native @entity73 travers spent years rejecting attempts by @entity9 executives , who had spotted the film potential of the stories			1
after refusing offers from most @entity117 film studios she finally gave in to @entity9 , accepting a $ 100,000 advance , around $ 2 million dollars today , as well as five per cent of the film 's profits and the chance to approve the script personally			1
bestseller : the author wrote eight books before she died aged 96 , selling many copies across the world but from there the relationship then turned sour			0
she constantly contacted the studio throughout filming with objections and attacked its producers and director			0
this culminated in her being stopped from attending the film 's premiere , but she managed to sneak in and watched the film in floods of tears			0
she then refused ever to work with @entity9 on any other project , preventing them doing a sequel to the much - loved film			1
' @entity15 , a friend of mine , has all the necessary integrity to play the part â€“ she was just directed wrongly			0
' she was quite prepared to put on a black wig , with a knob of hair at the back , and a turned - up nose			0
she 's a great trooper and very honest			0
but to her surprise , as well as mine , @entity9 turned her into a very pretty girl , which really loses the point			2
' her experiences with @entity9 were so bruising that when the stage version was first mooted she agreed on the proviso that ' no @entity117 ' would be involved			0
she died aged 96 still upset about what had happened			0
the new film is expected to be released in 2014 , fifty years after @entity10 hit the big screen .			1

creator @entity7 never forgave @entity9 because she was so appalled by the film that made her rich
@entity10 was too pretty , too nice and the author also disliked the songs and animations in the much - loved musical
@entity7 resisted @entity9 's advances for 14 years but after she gave in and the *classic* film was made in 1964 she *regretted* it
@entity44 and @entity45 will star in a *biopic* movie @entity43 set to be released in 2014
