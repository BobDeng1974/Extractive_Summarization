a seven - year - old girl battling cancer has arrived in @entity2 for proton beam therapy , after strangers helped raise more than £ 180,000 so her parents did n't have to sell their family home			1
@entity8 , left the @entity9 on tuesday with her parents @entity10 and @entity12 , and brothers @entity13 , 11 , and @entity15 , five			1
@entity17 beam therapy , which the family hope will save @entity8 ’s life after her tumour tripled in size , will start at a clinic in @entity24 this week			1
the family faced a setback before they got on the plane as there were fears that @entity8 , who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in august , would not be fit to fly			1
@entity8 , seven , has arrived in @entity2 to receive proton beam therapy treatment for her cancer			1
well - wishers donated £ 180,00 for her treatment			2
here , @entity8 is pictured thanking readers for their donations @entity8 's parents @entity10 and @entity12 updated her @entity42 followers , revealing the family were off to @entity2 on monday afternoon			1
she said a ' heartfelt thanks ' to all their supporters initially , @entity10 and @entity12 , pictured with their sons @entity13 ( right ) and @entity15 ( left ) had vowed sell their family home in a bid to raise £ 160,000 to fund treatment for @entity8 ( centre )			1
but their story received widespread publicity , spurring donations from well - wishers a scan revealed a dangerous build of fluid on her brain which indicated she might have needed surgery			2
the news came shortly after her family and friends raised funds for the treatment , which is not currently available in the @entity9			2
@entity8 was admitted to hospital last wednesday where it was originally feared a shunt on her brain to drain a build - up of fluid had stopped working and she would need to undergo emergency brain surgery			1
but her parents were relieved when doctors found the shunt was working , and successfully cleared the build up without the need for surgery			2
they were then given the green light to fly to @entity2 for the treatment they hope will save @entity8 ’s life			1
the family initially put their home on the market for £ 50,000 less than it 's market value to try and raise the money for @entity8 's treatment quickly			1
but her plight gained a huge amount of publicity and donations from well wishers meant the family have raised £ 185,371 to date			1
doctors said the proton beam therapy treatment offers @entity8 the best chance of survival			1
without it , she may not live past @entity105 , they said doctors misdiagnosed @entity8 's brain tumour as growing pains five times before her parents were told she was battling cancer			1
she is pictured left and right during treatment this means they will no longer have to sell their family home in @entity116			1
the family will now stay together in accommodation near the hospital in @entity24 where @entity8 will be treated for one hour a day between monday and friday for two months			1
it means they will be able to spend @entity105 together in @entity2			2
before she left for @entity2 , mother @entity10 , 36 , a dinner lady , revealed the family had been told that the @entity123 would not have funded @entity8 to have proton beam therapy because her tumour is too aggressive			1
@entity17 beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision			2
the radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy x-rays , used in conventional radiotherapy			0
unlike an x-ray , the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body			0
it enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely			0
the beam can be more finely controlled , in both its width and its depth , so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours , with less risk to healthy tissues			0
the treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many different tumours , including those found in the head and neck , eye , central nervous system , lung , prostate and gastrointestinal tract			0
the precision of the pencil beam scanning makes it especially beneficial in treating tumours adjacent to critical and sensitive organs , such as the eye , brain and spinal cord			0
source : @entity173 she said : ‘ even if we had have applied for funding we would n’t have got it so thank goodness we started fundraising			0
’ she also spoke of her joy at not having to sell the family home and the importance of being able to stay together as a family			2
she said : ‘ friends , family , everyone that donated , thank you , from the bottom of our hearts			1
‘ it ’s so important for us to be able to stay together at a time like this			0
as parents you want to be there for all your children and that is what keeps you strong			0
‘ i ’m in awe of the way people have rallied together to help us , our friends and family have been incredible and the kindness of complete strangers has restored my faith in everything			2
’ but she added that she hoped her daughter ’s case would highlight the need for proton beam therapy to be available in the @entity9 sooner rather than later			1
she said : ‘ we are the lucky ones because we have amazing friends and family who have helped us and the public support has been overwhelming , but we still feel that @entity8 and every other patient should be able to access this therapy in the @entity9			1
‘ when you are dealing with the news that your child or someone you love has cancer you want to be supporting them and spending time together not desperately fundraising and searching for treatment to try and save them			0
‘ we need it here now , not in five years time and i hope what happened to us helps make that possible for another family so they do n’t have to go through this			0
’ they now plan to keep their 9,000 followers on @entity42 updated with @entity8 ’s progress and on monday evening posted a status with the news that they were set to travel to the states			0
it said : ' dear friends , family , donators and well wishers … everyone who has helped us achieve the following			0
' we are off to @entity2 at 6am tomorrow morning			0
our heartfelt thanks to you all for your help it means we will be together at @entity105 getting the best medicine we can			0
see you next year … feeling positive			0
’ mr and mrs @entity251 had planned to cancel their august wedding , after @entity8 , was diagnosed the same month			1
but the seven - year - old told her parents she was desperate to be a bridesmaid the comment was met with a surge of over 2,000 likes from supporters			1
a family friend told @entity262 and her parents were in good spirits when they left their south @entity264 home yesterday morning			2
she said : ‘ they were feeling really happy and positive to be on their way at last			0
it ’s been a rollercoaster but they got there and @entity8 was smiling			0
‘ i can not express how much they appreciate the support they have had from the public across @entity9 and even worldwide as well as all their family and friends in @entity264			0
' everyone has worked so hard to make this possible and it means so much to them			0
‘ they they were just so pleased and relieved to be on their way to getting their daughter the best medicine			0
’ though the target has been met to cover the initial cost of treatment the fund raising page remains open to help meet the ongoing cost of after care and future treatment @entity8 might need			2
