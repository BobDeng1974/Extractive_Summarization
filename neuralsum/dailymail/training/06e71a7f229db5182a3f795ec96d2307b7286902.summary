archaeologists have discovered an ' epic ' new fossil site they could change what we know about animal evolution			1
the secret site is revealing fossils at an ' astonishing ' rate , researchers say			1
they claim it will significantly increase our understanding of animals in the cambrian period			0
this new finding is the latest in a recent string of @entity21 discoveries , including confirmation that @entity34 , found only in @entity22 , is the most primitive known vertebrate and therefore the ancestor of all descendant vertebrates , including humans			1
now , more than a century after its discovery , a compelling sequel has been unearthed : 42 kilometres away in @entity41 , a new @entity21 fossil site has been located that appears to equal the importance of the original discovery , and may one day even surpass it			1
approximately 200 animal species had been identified at the original @entity22 site in over 600 field days			2
in just 15 days of field collecting , 50 animal species have already been unearthed at the new site			2
the site , discovered in the summer of 2012 by an international research team led by @entity54 ecology and evolutionary biologist @entity55 , is described in a paper released today in @entity57			2
' this is an epic new chapter in a research story that began more than 100 years ago and there is no doubt in my mind that this new material will significantly increase our understanding of early animal evolution , ' said @entity14			0
' the rate at which we are finding animals — many of which are new — is astonishing , and there is a significant possibility that we ’ll eventually find more species here than at the original @entity22 site , and potentially more than from anywhere else in the world			1
' protected by @entity77 , the exact location of the new site remains confidential to protect its integrity - though future visitor opportunities have not been ruled out			1
researchers say they are finding fossils at an ' astonishing ' rate the remote location is being kept secret to avoid fossil hunters descending on it ' we were already aware of the presence of some @entity21 fossils in @entity41 , ' said research team member @entity90 of @entity91			1
' we had a hunch that if we followed the formation along the mountain topography into new areas with the right rock types , maybe , just maybe , we would get lucky – though we never in our wildest dreams thought we ’d track down a motherlode like this			0
' it did n’t take us very long at all to realize that we had dug up something special			0
a panoramic image of the area ' to me , the @entity21 is a grand tale in every way imaginable , and we are incredibly proud to be part of this new chapter and to keep the story alive and thriving in everyone ’s imagination			1
' some species found at the new @entity41 site are also found in @entity116 's famous @entity115 fossil beds , which are 10 million years older			1
this contributes to the pool of evidence suggesting that the local and worldwide distribution of @entity122 animals , as well as their longevity , might have been underestimated			0
some of the fossil finds - in just 15 days of field collecting , 50 animal species have already been unearthed at the new site			1
the team is set to return to the area soon to continue their hunt ' we know that we have barely scratched the site and nonetheless found at least 12 new species to describe , ' said @entity134 , a phd student in @entity54 's @entity135			2
' what awaits us there , only the mountain knows , but chances are high that the discoveries will fuel a lot more research			0
' the full potential of these new fossil beds has yet to be revealed			2
' approximately 200 animal species had been identified at the original @entity22 site in over 600 field days			2
in just 15 days of field collecting , 50 animal species have already been unearthed at the new @entity41 site			2
the @entity122 explosion , or @entity122 radiation , was the relatively rapid appearance , around 530million years ago , of most major animal phyla , as demonstrated in the fossil record			0
before about 580million years ago , most organisms were simple , composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies			0
over the following 70 or 80million years , the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude ( as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species ) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today			0
it ended with the @entity122 – @entity170 extinction event , approximately 488million years ago			0
a paper published today in the prestigious scientific journal @entity57 describes @entity41 's new ' @entity174 ' fossil beds for the first time			0
the authors suggest that the area and its extraordinary fossils will greatly further our understanding of the sudden explosion of animal life during the @entity122			0
the remote site is only accessible by helicopter the team it could help us understand how early animals evolved this new finding is the latest in a recent string of @entity21 discoveries , including confirmation that @entity34 , found only in @entity22 , is the most primitive known vertebrate and therefore the ancestor of all descendant vertebrates , including humans			1
in over 100 years of research , approximately 200 animal species have been identified at the original @entity21 discovery in @entity22 in over 600 field days			1
in just 15 days of field collecting , 50 animal species have already been unearthed at the new @entity41 site .			0

site close to @entity21 , one of the most important fossil sites
exact location being kept secret to avoid thieves *targetting* it
researchers say they are find fossils at an ' astonishing ' rate
