the device is made up of a curved plastic arm and a nylon carry - strap that is attached to a flat base , creating the perfect balance to stop anything from spilling it can even be rotated around above head height , twirled in circles , or swung from side to side as it is carried without losing any liquid			1
the gadget uses centripetal force , a physics concept that means an object is forced to move in a curved line , to make the mug remain perfectly balanced			2
the clever contraption uses centripedal force to to ensure none of the drink spills - even if you swing it around			1
the makers claim that it doesn ¿ t matter how much or how little you move , it will not spill , and that is due to the curvature in the arm of the holder it can carry any mug or glass that is less than 4.5 inches wide and can be used by adults or children with hot or cold drinks			2
the @entity9 can carry any mug that is less than 4.5 inches wide and can be used by adults and children the @entity9 costs around £ 10 from thinkgeek.com , a company based in @entity58			1
@entity59 , 32 , from @entity60 , said : ' staff were walking around our office and as they carried hot drinks they were spilling them			0
' we thought there must be a way to stop them spilling and after researching it we found a company , @entity9 , who made these holders			1
' the @entity9 keeps you dry and stops clothes , shoes , and carpets getting stained , as well as stopping people being scalded by a hot beverage			1
' it is good for people who might stumble or trip and in our office now , we have at least four or five people using the holders at any one time			0
' it can be used by children as well as adults and is not only good for hot drinks , but also for cold ones			0
' it works using physics , centripetal force , so as you move and swing your arm the downward force goes to the base of the device			2
' it is a simple concept made into something that works well in every day life			0
' it does n’t matter how much or how little you move , it will not spill , and that is due to the curvature in the arm of the holder			0
' you can even swing and twirl it around			0

@entity9 holder uses *centritedal* force to stop water *escaping* from a *cup*
@entity110 , based in @entity58 , is so effective that users can even swing their drink in circles without losing so much as a *sip*
