‘ they were suffering from hypothermia and dehydration			1
one person had died within the container – that gives you an indication of what the conditions were like			1
’ detectives declined to say where the migrants had started their journey on the grounds that releasing the information might compromise their inquiry into what they described as a human - trafficking incident			2
the container had been loaded from a lorry on to @entity21 ’s @entity41 ferry at @entity24 on friday night.the ship arrived at @entity14 just after 5am yesterday and the alarm was raised nearly an hour and a half later when the desperate pleas for help were heard			1

‘ it is a homicide investigation			0
we will be looking to see what gangs may be involved in this conspiracy to bring these people in this way over to this country			2
clearly we need to try to bring them to justice			0
’ @entity125 said possible charges could include murder and manslaughter , although there was no suggestion anyone from the container was a suspect			1
he added : ‘ all of the victims – and i will call them victims – are recovering fairly quickly in most cases , and are obviously being detained under immigration powers			2
they will be taken to a reception centre within the port of @entity14			1
