by @entity0 and @entity1 controversial : deputy children 's commissioner @entity2 said the ' model ' of @entity5 men targeting white girls was just one of ' a number of models ' the author of report into gang sex abuse today hit back at government criticism of her findings that there was no particular problem among @entity5 groups			1
the study by deputy children ’s commissioner @entity2 came to the controversial conclusion , despite figures in her own report revealing that more than a quarter of perpetrators of gang - based child abuse known to the authorities are @entity5			1
senior @entity27 figures have branded the report ' hysterical ' and ' highly emotional '			2
last night a @entity30 source said it was ‘ difficult to overstate the contempt ’ with which ministers viewed the report ’s conclusions			2
and the @entity36 said the report exposed the danger of ‘ turning a blind eye ’ to the ethnicity of abusers			1
miss @entity2 said the ‘ model ’ of @entity5 men targeting white girls was just one of ‘ a number of models ’ , and warned that if investigators concentrated on those patterns , victims could fall through the net			1
and today she challenged ministers to take her report seriously , warning them it was a ' wake - up call '			0
' this is a very calm , measured report , ' she told @entity55 's today programme			2
' we have left out the most harrowing details , really shocking distressing stories that children have told us , that we have heard form police			2
i would say to the government : this is a wake up call			0
' this is the most comprehensive pulling together of sexual abuse in @entity66			0
they need to take it very seriously and show some leadership			0
' she denied that the problem of @entity5 men targeting white girls had been ' left out ' of her report , but repeatedly insisted it ' is only one model ' of abuse			1
she also appeared to blame police forces and councils for failing to collect information on the race and faith of perpetrators			0
of the information , of the data sent to us by the police and local authorities about perpetrators , in six out of 10 cases there was no information available - the ethnicity and faith was not identified			2
' where children are falling through the net because people think it there is only one model of abuse this is a wake up call , ' she added			2
' we have heard evidence from the police forces that there are white males doing this across the country in fairly large numbers			0
' dim light : figures in the report state that out of 1,514 perpetrators identified , some 415 were @entity5 ( file photo ) she said there was not evidence to conclude that there was a particular issue with @entity5 gangs			1
instead , her report says simply that abuse is carried out by men of all backgrounds			0
in may , nine @entity5 men who groomed white girls as young as 13 in @entity125 with drink and drugs were jailed at @entity128			1
judge @entity129 told them one of the reasons they targeted their victims was because they were not part of their community or religion			0
last year @entity138 was jailed for his role as ringleader of a @entity142 gang that cruised streets for girls as young as 12 who were plied with vodka and cocaine before being raped or abused			0
@entity149 origin : @entity138 was jailed for his role as ringleader of a @entity142 gang that cruised streets for girls as young as 12 before raping or abusing them @entity138 , who is of @entity149 origin , took the vulnerable young girls to ‘ parties ’ in hotels or flats with other gang members			0
two months ago , documents emerged which allegedly showed agencies in @entity159 were aware of allegations of widespread targeted abuse of teenage girls in the town by groups of @entity5 men – but did nothing for fear of looking racist			1
@entity168 , chief executive of the @entity36 , said : ‘ if there is a problem with one community in a particular area we must be bold enough to address it and not just turn a blind eye			1
’ a government source said : ‘ it is difficult to overstate the contempt the government has for the methodology and analysis in this report			0
the whole thing is half - baked			0
’ figures in the report state that out of 1,514 perpetrators identified , some 415 were @entity5			1
this is 27 per cent of the total , far in excess of the proportion of @entity5 people in the community at large , which is 6 per cent			1
some 545 are described as white , 244 as black , 49 as mixed , while the rest were undisclosed			0
but miss @entity2 ’s report said : ‘ different models of exploitation have been identified			1
the evidence is clear that perpetrators come from all ethnic groups and so do their victims – contrary to what some may wish to believe			0
’ the report suggested the proportion of @entity5 perpetrators in the figures may be higher than whites because the authorities were targeting non-whites			1
unhappy : @entity210 mp @entity209 said it was ' very disappointing ' that the report shied away from tackling a ' specific problem in certain @entity5 communities - specifically the @entity149 community ' it even concluded that the data on ethnicity was ‘ unreliable ’ because victims sometimes changed their description of their abuser			1
' on the face of it , this is an issue for all ethnicities , but there is a specific problem in certain @entity5 communities – specifically the @entity149 community – in too many cities to ignore the phenomenon			1
unless we recognise the problem , we wo n’t be able to devise a strategy for tackling it ' @entity210 mp @entity209 a @entity27 source said last week : ‘ it ’s important we do n’t take a politically correct approach and pretend there is not a real problem here			0
' obviously abuse has been carried out by men from all sorts of ethnic background			0
but that does n’t mean we can not say there is an issue about groups of @entity149 men systematically targeting young white girls			2
’ @entity210 mp @entity209 said : ‘ on the face of it , this is an issue for all ethnicities , but there is a specific problem in certain @entity5 communities – specifically the @entity149 community – in too many cities to ignore the phenomenon			1
‘ unless we recognise the problem , we wo n’t be able to devise a strategy for tackling it			0
' it is very disappointing that this report has shied away from it , given the fact that some leadership is coming from within the @entity5 community			2

fury at result of deputy children 's commissioner @entity2 's study
said figures on @entity5 gangs were *n't* enough to conclude particular issue
@entity36 says there is danger of ' turning a blind eye ' to abusers ' ethnicity
