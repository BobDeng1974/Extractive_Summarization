by @entity0 @entity1 is bored with the ' controversy ' rumbling around her photographs			1
the portrait artist 's beautifully stylised and highly emotive images of very young , damp - cheeked children sobbing up close to her camera lens drew accusations of ' child abuse ' when they were first seen in 2006			1
but the @entity17 - based mother - of - two , who has now released a collection of the photos as a stunning hardback art book with @entity14 and @entity16 - based @entity15 , says she had no intention of creating such a stir with her images , and was shocked to have actually received hate mail as a result of them			1
the truth : @entity1 's photos depict crying children but were intended to reflect her dissatisfaction with @entity29 - era politics in 2006 the @entity30 : @entity1 used her daughter , her daughter 's friends and some child models in the photos speaking to @entity36 , @entity1 said : ' children at that age cry as a form of communication since they ca n't use their words , its not evidence of pain			1
' ' making children cry for a photographer can be considered mean , ' she continued in @entity46			1
' but i would say that making children laugh and show off their jeans for an apparel ad is just as exploitative and less natural			1
toddlers ' natural state , like 30 per cent of the time , is crying			2
' to get the children welling up , @entity1 and the infants ' mothers would offer the tots sweets and chocolate or something just as tantalising , such as a mobile phone , then stop short of handing them over , prompting a tantrum			1
in a statement about the collection on her website , @entity1 says : ' nothing is more pure than the anguish of a child			1
pictures of children crying capture raw emotion : sputtering rage and profound loss			1
' in many ways we ’ve become desensitized to disturbing image			1
but the honesty of a child 's feelings is undeniable and it draws you in to the photograph			1
perhaps because kids experience the kind of powerful emotions that we , as adults , have suppressed in ourselves			2

and , as a mother , i am quite aware of how easily toddlers can cry			1
storms of grief sweep across their features without warning ; a joyful smile can dissolve into a grimace of despair			2
' the first little boy i shot , @entity118 , suddenly became hysterically upset			2
it reminded me of helplessness and anger i feel about our current political and social situation			2
' it made me think of my outrage at our false reasons for going to war in @entity128 and the scandalous way in which the conflict was sold to the @entity132 people			2
i thought of @entity29 , then just sworn into his second term in office , and i decided to call the image " four more years "			1

their pain is a precursor of that is to come ' ' as any new parent will tell you , the future suddenly becomes a very serious concern			2
as ecstatic as i was at the birth of my daughter , i felt selfish bringing her , and later my son into our screwed - up world			1
i seemed to become a mother at exactly the moment things went awry			0
' of course , human beings have always been greedy , violent and dishonest			0
but the rise of the @entity166 right as a political force in this country has made the situation dire			0
the most dangerous fundamentalists are n’t just waging war in @entity128 ; they 're attacking evolution , blocking medical research and ignoring the environment			0
' it 's as if they believe the apocalyptic end time is near , therefore protecting the earth and the future of all our children is futile			1
