a @entity1 paleontologist has discovered not one , but two new species of dinosaur while studying fossils in a @entity7 museum			1
dr @entity8 was examining fossilised bones from two horned dinosaurs , which had been kept in the @entity11 for 75 years			1
and he found that , while they had previously been classified as a species from @entity7 , they more closely resembled dinosaurs from the @entity16 south west - suggesting they are a new species			1
this illustration shows @entity18 , a new species of dinosaur discovered by a @entity1 paleontologist in a @entity7 museum			1
dr @entity8 was examining fossilised bones from two horned dinosaurs , which had been kept in the @entity11 for 75 years , when he made the finding the fossils had previously been classified as @entity25 and @entity26 , species known to be from @entity7 , but now that classification may need to be changed			1
one represents a new species of @entity30 , said dr @entity8 , named @entity30 aquilonius - a buffalo - sized plant - eating dinosaur from around 75 million years ago			1
the second appears to be a new species of @entity37 , a dinosaur with an ornate skull from @entity40 , though more complete fossils are needed to confirm this			2
back in september , scientists announced they had discovered a supermassive dinosaur measuring 85ft ( 26m ) long and weighing 59,300kg ( about 65 tons )			0
the skeleton of the @entity46 , seven times bigger than @entity48 , was also the most complete skeleton ever found of its type , with more than 70 per cent of its bones - excluding the head			0
because all previously discovered supermassive dinosaurs are only known from partial remains , @entity53 offers an unprecedented window into the largest animals to ever walk on @entity58			2
dr @entity8 , from the @entity59 , said his find revealed dinosaur species from the region were much more diverse than previously thought			1
' we thought we had discovered most of the species , but it seems there are many undiscovered dinosaurs left , ' said dr @entity8 , from the university 's @entity68			1
' the total dinosaur diversity must have been extraordinarily high			0
' we 've really only just scratched the surface			0
' pentaceratops was a smaller cousin of @entity74 , belonging to a group of large , horned dinosaurs with a long brow horn and elongate frills called the @entity79			0
the dinosaurs were based in western @entity81 at the end of the @entity83 , around 75 million years ago			1
up until now , ten @entity85 species have been recognised from that period , with distinct species occurring in the northern and southern parts of the continent			0
dr @entity8 believes that , although distinct northern and southern provinces existed , there was contact between them			2
dinosaurs would spread from one part of the continent to the other , then diverge to form new species			0
competition between the different species then prevented the dinosaurs from moving between the northern and southern regions			0
pictured here is the fossil previously believed to be @entity25 ornatus at the @entity11 , @entity105 , @entity106			2
but dr @entity8 said it may have been classified incorrectly this image shows what was previously thought to be @entity26			1
dr @entity8 said his find revealed dinosaur species from @entity81 were much more diverse than had been previously thought ' the distribution of dinosaur species was very different from the patterns seen in living mammals , ' dr @entity8 said			1
' in living mammals , there tend to be relatively few large species , and they have large ranges			0
with @entity83 dinosaurs , we see a lot of large species in a single habitat			2
' they also tend to be very regional - as you move from one habitat to another you get a completely different set of species			0
' the patterns help explain why paleontologists keep finding more species , as they discover them when examining different habitats			0
dr @entity8 believes such patterns are caused by dinosaur biology			1
' in this sense , dinosaur biology seems quite different from mammal biology , ' he said			0
' it could be that mammals are more intelligent and so they tend to have more flexible behaviour , and adapt their behaviour to their habitat ' on the other hand , dinosaurs may have had to adapt themselves physically to survive in a different habitat , and evolved new species			0
' dr @entity8 's study appears in the academic journal @entity153 .			2

dr @entity8 from @entity59 has discovered new species of dinosaur
he made the finding while working at the @entity11
the fossilised bones from two dinosaurs had been *stored* for 75 years
previously they were thought to be species from @entity7 called @entity25 and @entity26
but dr @entity8 said they are new species from western @entity81
one is a species of @entity30 , and the other is @entity37
both lived in the @entity83 about 75 million years ago
