' two thirds was building waste , rubble and plasterboard but the front of the pile was mainly black bag waste and looked mostly like household waste such as food containers and cans			1
' in the landlord 's defence , i do n't think the black bag waste has come from that house			1
' the council 's environmental health team did some bag searches and have traced the rubbish to other houses so those residents will be getting a visit			2

' we are working with the local businesses and communities , to create a better understanding of how they should dispose of their domestic waste , and are actively tackling fly - tipping by investigating the unscrupulous people who consider dumping waste at the roadside to be acceptable			1
let me be clear , it is not			0
