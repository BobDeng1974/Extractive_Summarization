in an unprecedented move , the @entity3 have extended @entity7 ’s @entity6 exemption for one more year to enable him to bow out at @entity8 in 2015			1
given this will also be the 40th anniversary of the first of his five victories , at @entity15 in 1975 , it ’s hard to imagine anyone will think the @entity17 have called this one wrong			0
‘ if i have to crawl , i ’ll be there , ’ said the 64 - year - old , who will make his 36th appearance at the @entity6 at @entity21 in a fortnight ’s time			1

’ veteran : @entity27 have extended @entity7 's @entity6 exemption for one more year still going : @entity7 will make his 36th appearance at the @entity6 at @entity21 @entity7 will be wearing two hats , of course , when he turns up at @entity31 , given he is also @entity33 ’s @entity32 captain			1
to that end , he could hardly keep the excitement out of his voice when asked about @entity38 ’s imminent return to major championship action			0
‘ it is great to see him back and i just hope he is able to play free from pain , ’ he said			0
but he did insert a caveat when it came to a possible appearance at @entity46 in september			2
‘ i want him on the team if he is healthy and playing well , ’ he added			0
the announcement of @entity7 ’s invite came on the same day as almost 300 golfers competing at four great courses went after the 12 precious spots up for grabs for this year ’s championship at final qualifying			1
they included @entity56 , who gave up the spot he earned as @entity58 when he turned professional a fortnight ago			2
the 19 - year - old never really recovered from a poor finish to his first round and has one last chance to make it at the @entity6 this week , where three spots are available to the highest - placed finishers not already qualified			1
@entity67 ’s promising amateur @entity66 , 21 , posted an impressive 36 - hole total of 10 under par to book his place			0
@entity46 : @entity7 plays a shot on the 9th during an event to mark the legacy of the @entity75 @entity76 : @entity77 holds the @entity78 as he stands with runner up @entity7 after winning the 2009 @entity80			2
