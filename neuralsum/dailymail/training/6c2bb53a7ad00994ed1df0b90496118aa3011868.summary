sixth - formers at a highly - rated secondary school were asked to discuss myths about @entity3 , pictured , using a @entity5 kit a fresh row over ‘ dumbing down ’ in the classroom has broken out after a-level students were taught about @entity3 using @entity5 people			1
sixth - formers at a highly - rated secondary school were asked to discuss myths about @entity3 using a @entity5 kit containing figures and building blocks			1
the exercise involved pupils being asked questions such as ‘ why is @entity3 wearing a witch ’s hat ? ’ , which prompted the response ‘ to show the spell that @entity3 put on @entity21 ’			1
the teacher responsible for the lesson at @entity24 in @entity25 posted details on his blog as an example for others to follow , leading to it being circulated widely on @entity31			1
an online backlash ensued on student and teacher forums , with critics branding the exercise ‘ unacceptable dumbing down ’			1
the row follows the revelation in 2013 by former education secretary @entity39 that @entity41 pupils were being encouraged to learn about the @entity42 using mr @entity44 characters			0
he highlighted a teaching resources website – @entity46 - which suggested ‘ depicting @entity3 ’s rise as a mr @entity44 story ’			1
he told teachers ‘ it reduces the history of @entity21 ’s darkest years to a falling out between mr @entity52 and mr @entity53 ’			0
mr @entity39 insisted reforms to the curriculum and exams being phased in from 2014 onwards would improve lessons			0
but critics claimed little had been learned from the mr men debacle after details emerged of the @entity5 lesson for @entity64 students			1
@entity65 , the teacher who delivered the lesson , insisted it was ‘ creative ’ and ‘ memorable ’ while not compromising on ‘ depth and detail ’			2
he said it had produced ‘ high quality ’ work that was ‘ better than it would have been ’ had the lesson followed its usual course			0
the lesson , which took place during the autumn term , used a @entity80 kit produced by @entity5 for pupils in key stages one and two – ages four to 11			2
it contained assorted characters , animals accessories and basic bricks			0
pupils were required to investigate the personality cult created around @entity3 by @entity91 propagandist @entity90 using @entity5 scenes			1
the lesson , which took place during the autumn term , used a @entity80 kit produced by @entity5 for pupils in key stages one and two – ages four to 11 on his blog , mr @entity65 recalled : ‘ the students were really engaged on the task and produced very creative solutions			1
‘ “ why is @entity3 wearing a witches hat ? ” “ to show the spell that @entity3 put on @entity21			2
” ‘ “ why is @entity3 waving to a cat ? ” “ he is giving up his personal happiness to devote himself to the nation			2
” ‘ “ why is the spider laid like that ? ” “ he is giving the @entity42 salute showing how devoted all his people were ”			0
’ but one critic on the @entity114 website said they were ‘ most concerned by the embarrassingly low demand of the task ’ and the ‘ laughably shallow ’ level of analysis required			0
another wrote : ‘ i think creative teaching methods are great but if this – “ why is @entity3 wearing a witch ’s hat ? ” “ to show the spell that @entity3 put on @entity21 ” - is the quality of analysis your as students are producing then i ’d say that ’s a problem			1
’ there was further criticism from fellow teachers on the @entity135 forum , with one dismissing the lesson as ‘ anti-intellectual nonsense ’			0
one said : ‘ i do n’t believe such a lightweight exercise delivered through such as trivial , jokey medium would prompt any serious thought or insight into @entity3 or propaganda			1
’ another mocked mr @entity65 ’s ‘ fancy ’ title - leadership secondment for @entity145 – and said it was ‘ worrying ’ that he believed ‘ getting 6th formers to play with lego is a valid teaching strategy ’			1
the teacher responsible for the lesson at @entity24 in @entity25 , pictured , posted details on his blog as an example for others to follow and they said : ‘ i encounter a lot of younger colleagues who appear to believe that a productive lesson somehow involves entertainment			1
it ’s an attitude usually accompanied by the almost constant use of the words guys and bud			0
’ following the backlash , mr @entity65 wrote a follow - up blog describing his experience of being ‘ panned ’ on the internet and complaining about ‘ incredibly negative and offensive posts ’			1
‘ having discussed this with my colleagues , and with several of my sixth form students , i have been struck by support i have received , ’ he said			2
‘ several students have spoken to me about how much they got out of the lesson and how it has helped them think about the topic of propaganda			0
‘ i realise how lucky i am to work where i do			0
‘ in the face of this abuse i have had to be resilient , it would have been easy to delete my blog , it would be easy to stop sharing my work , it would be easy to stop innovating , it would be easy to keep my head down and let the bullies win			0
’ but he said ‘ there is absolutely no way that i will stop trying to innovate ’			0
the school where he works has been rated ‘ outstanding ’ by @entity190			2
there is debate in some quarters , however , over the extent to which the watchdog is dismissive of traditional teaching and welcoming of practices such as ‘ independent learning ’ , group work and bite - size activities			2
sir @entity201 , the chief inspector , said he was ‘ enraged ’ by claims made in a report in march 2014 that some inspectors prefer certain teaching styles			0
however he insisted it was incorrect to suggest that @entity190 was ‘ full of lefty , hippy types ’ .			0
