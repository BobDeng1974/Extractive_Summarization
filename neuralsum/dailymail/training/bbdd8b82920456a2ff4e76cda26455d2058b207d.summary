by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will sit down with sir @entity3 for the first time over the weekend when the former @entity6 manager joins the club ’s pre-season tour in @entity9			1
new @entity6 boss @entity10 said last week that he was keen to have coffee with @entity3 and is understood to be keen to pick the @entity14 icon ’s brains about life at @entity14			1
@entity3 has spent much of the summer on holiday but is flying out to @entity17 on saturday and will be with the @entity18 in @entity9 and then @entity19			1
with @entity6 having got their tour off to a good start in @entity35 with a 7 - 0 defeat of @entity37 , @entity10 ’s team face @entity38 in @entity39 this afternoon			1
centre forward @entity20 scored twice against @entity37 at @entity40 on wednesday and is hoping to thrive in @entity10 ’s new 3 - 5 - 2 system			1
the @entity43 coach has said that this system is designed to incorporate two strikers and a ‘ number ten ’ and @entity20 hopes that will help him forget about the disappointment of @entity49 ’s @entity48 summer			1
' of course the system is good for me , ' said @entity20			1
' it ’s great to hear the manager say he wants to play two strikers as we have a few			2
it ’s a good formation and it ’s good to work on it in training for a few days			2
tin hat : @entity10 poses with the @entity39 fire department during their @entity17 tour gesture : @entity10 presents complimentary tickets for their match against @entity38 to the military and service personnel in @entity39 through the @entity69 campaign main man ? @entity10 seems to be focusing on @entity20 's development in the @entity6 squad ' it was always going to be interesting to see how it worked in a game and it worked well , which is good			1
it was a good result and good to get 45 minutes under my belt			2
' i ’ve only had a few days but he ’s a strong guy who has been good in training and it ’s been enjoyable			2
' he is bringing in a new style of play and wants us all to adapt to that and that ’s been enjoyable			2
it was good to see it work against @entity37			1
' @entity20 would have hoped to joined @entity6 ’s tour later , given that progress for @entity49 in @entity91 would have delayed his arrival in @entity17			1
however , the 28 - year - old claimed this week that he has already put the @entity48 – and the criticism that came on the back of @entity49 ’s early exit – behind him			1
' was i criticised in the @entity48 ? ' he asked			2
' i honestly did n’t know			2
but i think that happens			2
it ’s the world we live in			2
no messing about : @entity10 appears to have made his mark on the @entity6 squad already since joining ' i came to understand that a few years ago			1
i ’m not concerned about it at all			0
it was disappointing the way the @entity48 went but i said at the time it was time for me to look forward and concentrate on @entity6			1
' that is what i am doing			0
i am just trying to get fit and get ready for the season			0
it was always the plan for me to come on the tour			1
' we had a schedule depending on how we did in the @entity48			0
the @entity117 lads are here as well			0
but it ’s great to be here			0
i have had a good break and i ’m happy to be here			0
' we have a few weeks before the season starts and all this is just preparing for the first game against @entity123			0
we have to try and put our efforts in to what @entity125 wants			0
' @entity10 has not indicated yet who he feels will be his captain at @entity6			1
@entity20 , who would have been handed the role had @entity130 still been in charge , would love the job and feels that @entity6 can launch a serious assault on the @entity135 title this season			1
on target : @entity20 scored a first - half penalty in @entity6 's 7 - 0 pre-season friendly win against @entity37 ' of course we can win the title , ' he said			1
' last season was a bad one , we know that , but we are confident we can put it right			0
we have to believe we can win the title			1
' of course i would like the captaincy but it ’s the managers decision who he chooses			0
' i think he wants to work with the players and then choose a captain from there			0
i do n’t think he was ever going to just walk in and choose a player from the off			0
i ’m sure he will look at the players now and make his decision in a couple of weeks			0
' he ’s very honest in training			0
if you are not doing well in training he will tell you but if you do well he will praise you			0
' if you are n’t doing things right in training you need to know so that you can put them right			0
in @entity91 i watched the way @entity168 were playing and i carried on doing that when i came home			0
' however you can watch as much as you want but it ’s when you hear him getting his point across in training that you start to learn			0
