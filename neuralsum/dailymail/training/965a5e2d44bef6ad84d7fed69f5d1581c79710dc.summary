@entity0 insists @entity1 wo n't sign any more ' t * * * * rs ' who are n't interested in playing for the club following @entity6 ' recent struggles in the @entity7			1
@entity0 's side go into the new campaign having been promoted through the play - offs , spending just one season away from the elite , and with a squad that bares almost no resemblance to that which slipped down to the @entity16 in 2013			1
@entity17 was criticised for laughing and joking as he left the field following the dire goalless draw with @entity20 that sealed both sides ' @entity7 fate , but he was not the only marquee signing to fail at @entity24			1
no nonsense : @entity1 manager @entity0 insists the club wo n't sign the wrong type of player again parted : @entity1 boss @entity0 split with defensive coach @entity29 before the @entity7 season video new teams wo n't break into top seven - @entity0 the likes of @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 all came in on high wages and were soon deemed to be unwanted by the man in charge			1
former @entity41 and @entity43 captain @entity42 penned a one - year contract at @entity24 on thursday , becoming @entity0 's first new signing of the summer			1
the duo worked together at @entity47 , with @entity0 handing a 17 - year - old @entity42 his professional debut in 1996 , and both will be hoping for a positive reunion			1
in signing 35 - year - old @entity42 , @entity0 is certain he is not falling into the same trap for a second time			1
' we are determined not to make those mistakes again , ' he said			0
' i think @entity56 ( @entity57 , chairman ) and the board have learned from that so we have got to make sure this time , as best we can , we make the right decisions and get the right characters in here			2
@entity63 : @entity42 brings experience to @entity1 having signed a one - year contract next in line : @entity68 's @entity67 could follow @entity42 to @entity24 and play alongside him ' we do n't want people who are going to come here just for the money and not be interested in the club			1
we want people who genuinely want to come here and play and do well for us			0
' you have to do your homework on people			0
if they are a t * * * * r you find out do n't you ? you talk to people and there is always someone in the game you know , who might be a good player and played with them			2
you say ' what 's he like ? '			0
' and @entity57 tweeted : ' this season is all about players who want to play for us			0
some will move to bigger clubs most will stay some will come			0
' with a clothing brand , online magazine and record label , as well as working as a pundit for the @entity95 during the @entity96 , @entity42 has many interests that could have seen him move away from a playing career			1
but , with reports that @entity42 's basic wage at @entity1 will be as low as Â£ 40,000 a week , @entity0 feels there are enough factors which prove his desire to continue			1
experience : @entity42 won six @entity7 titles and a @entity106 during his time at @entity43 the future : @entity42 was a big part of the @entity95 's coverage at the @entity111 ' the money he has come here for , he does n't need to put himself out , ' he added			1
' how many championships has he won ? he 's been there and done everything			0
what we are paying him here is n't going to change his life			0
' you 've seen what he 's done at the @entity95 , he 's on the a-team			0
last game of the @entity96 , he 's there , him and ( @entity129 and @entity129 ( @entity130 ) , all those other pundits that were doing the shows but then they went " bosh " - this is the day we pick our top three			2
' he 's got a great future if he wants in television , or whatever he wants to do in his life			0
he could have been an ambassador , i think @entity43 wanted him			2
' he wants to play football			0
he 's like a little boy - ' i 've not been sleeping i 've been so excited about coming to play '			2
' he has got other business interests but i think he is n't going to come here unless he 's sure			0
why would you mug yourself off now when you 've been a top player ? ' why would he put himself under that pressure ? he is n't thick , he 's not stupid			2
why would he do it for the few quid that he 's going to earn here ? so he 's here to play			0
' meanwhile , the club have announced that midfielder @entity146 has joined @entity148 side @entity147 on a season - long loan			2
excited : @entity42 has wasted no time getting started at @entity1 with pre-season training underway new team - mates : @entity42 chats with @entity152 at @entity1 's training ground			1

@entity1 were relegated from the @entity7 in 2012 - 13 in bottom place
@entity0 got them promoted back to the top *flight* in 2013 - 14
@entity0 has signed former @entity43 defender @entity42
@entity1 could also complete signing of @entity68 defender @entity67
@entity0 says only good characters will be bought into club from now on
