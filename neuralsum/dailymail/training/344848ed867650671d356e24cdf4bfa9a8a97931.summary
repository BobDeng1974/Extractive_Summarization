the researchers expected to notice an improvement in reported pain among the third group , working on the hypothesis that many patients do n't find paracetamol effective because they take inadequate quantities of the drug			0
however , the researchers found that no matter how much paracetamol was taken by participants it made no difference to pain relief or speed of recovery			0
