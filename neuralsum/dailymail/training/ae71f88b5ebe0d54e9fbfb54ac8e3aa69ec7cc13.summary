by @entity1 reporter published : 10:12 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 12:19 est , 13 november 2012 @entity3 ' biographer - turned - mistress @entity2 sent an anonymous email to general @entity5 about @entity7 housewife and military social liaison @entity9 , as @entity2 suspected @entity9 of having a romantic relationship with @entity3 as well			1
the cyber love triangle expanded as it was revealed today that @entity5 was electronically connected with @entity2 after he received an email from one of her dummy accounts			1
he then went on to tell @entity9 , a married mom that he denies having an affair with , who in turn reported the emails to the @entity18			1
because of their respective involvement in the unfolding case , the @entity19 has requested access to the 20,000 - 30,000 pages of communications between @entity5 , the commander of @entity27 and @entity28 forces in @entity29 , and @entity9			1
one divulged example reported in the @entity51 was @entity5 's use of the word ' sweetheart ' in referring to married mom @entity9 , but a senior @entity19 official said that proves nothing as the 58 - year - old general is from @entity59 and the word is used in the south as a platonic phrase and not one demonstrating a romantic relationship			1
mrs @entity9 runs in the same social circle as both @entity3 and @entity5 as she serves as an unpaid social liaison for the military and often hosts events at her million - dollar home located only a couple of miles from @entity72			1
@entity5 served there from july 2008 to june 2011			0
@entity5 , a four - star @entity74 general , succeeded @entity3 as the top @entity27 commander in @entity29 in july 2011			2
request : gen @entity3 , pictured with his biographer and mistress @entity2 , asked her to stop when he found out she was sending threatening emails to family friend @entity9 brothers in arms : @entity5 ( left ) took over for @entity3 ( center , seen with defense secretary @entity83 ) as the commander of the @entity27 and @entity28 forces in @entity29 after @entity3 left to become the director of the @entity87 regarding the nature of the emails between @entity5 and @entity9 , an unidentified senior government official would not disclose whether they were inappropriate in a sexual nature or because classified documents were disclosed			1
denial : a government spokesman said that @entity5 never had an affair with @entity9 both of those misgivings were found in the case of @entity2 , who was discovered to be the person behind the ' harassing ' emails sent to @entity9 and @entity5			1
@entity2 entered the fold when she began writing a biography of @entity3 , and at some point in november 2011 the two began an affair			2
@entity3 was shocked to hear his mistress had been sending harassing emails to mrs @entity9 , who she saw as a rival for the ex-cia boss ' affections			1
when @entity9 told @entity3 that @entity2 was behind the emails , the four - star general told his biographer to knock it off , the @entity51 reported			1
the associate spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential conversations with @entity3			0
the @entity87 director resigned on friday after confessing to and apologizing for the affair			0
@entity2 reportedly sent the emails from dummy accounts she had set up to mrs @entity9 , @entity121 reported			1
spooked by the bullying in her inbox , mrs @entity9 notified the @entity18			2
victim : @entity9 , a family friend of gen @entity3 , went to the @entity18 after she received the threatening emails mistress : @entity2 's close contact with gen @entity3 raised red flags among his advisers a government official told the @entity133 that the emails contained such language as : ' i know what you did , ' ' back off ' and ' stay away from my guy			1
' the official added : ' [ @entity2 ] clearly thought something was going on ' and felt she was in a ' lovers triangle			0
' what followed was an intense @entity18 probe in which @entity2 and @entity3 - both married with two children - admitted to investigators that they had engaged in on - the - side sexual trysts			2
a senior federal law enforcement official told @entity150 that the probe concluded on november 2 , just four days before the presidential election			0
the network reported that director of national intelligence @entity153 was n't notified of the investigation until @entity156			0
indiscreet : aides have said @entity2 posted @entity160 postings about her adventures in @entity29 that crossed the line into potentially leaking sensitive operational details insensitive : @entity2 traveled frequently to interview @entity3 during his time in @entity29 but sources said her immodest attire made her stick out like a sore thumb in the conservative culture skeptical : those close to @entity3 were shocked the military chief placed so much confidence in @entity2 since they say she lacked the credibility and credentials of a biographer the emails were not the first time @entity2 had raised red flags while behind a computer			2
advisers to @entity3 had become suspicious @entity40 due to her playful @entity160 status updates they claim disclosed sensitive details about military operations in @entity29			2
she became a cause of concern back in 2009 when those in @entity3 ' inner circle saw her lighthearted postings on @entity160			0
former @entity3 aides told the @entity51 that @entity2 's behavior at the time seemed odd and her closeness to the notoriously straight - laced family man was not without controversy			0
without any specific examples of her @entity160 postings , aides said they were stunned that @entity2 was so free to describe her daily movements in @entity29 on the networking site , so her friends back home could chronicle her adventures			0
another social media no - no occurred when @entity2 posted a picture to her @entity160 page of @entity3 with actress @entity206 , that had been captured at his 7th floor office at @entity87 headquarters , where only the official agency photographer is allowed			0
it is believed he had given the picture to @entity2 but the break with protocol was uncharacteristic for someone in his position			0
video : top @entity27 official in @entity29 now under investigation			0

details of @entity3 ' affair with @entity2 *emerged* when she *allegedly* sent threatening *messages* to another woman , later revealed to be @entity226 military liaison @entity9
the @entity18 was contacted by mrs @entity9 - and the emails were tracked to dummy accounts linked to @entity40
@entity2 also anonymously emailed gen. @entity5 who is also friends with married mom @entity9
@entity234 denies @entity9 and @entity5 were having an affair but @entity19 still *combing* through 20,000 - 30,000 pages of communications between the two
