@entity0 has found a unique planet which wobbles on its axis - causing weather conditions to be even more erratic than those on @entity4			1
astronomers were stunned to find the planet , designated kepler - 413b wobbles wildly on its spin axis , much like a child 's top			1
the tilt of the planet 's spin axis can vary by as much as 30 degrees over 11 years , leading to rapid and erratic changes in seasons			1
@entity5 wobbles wildly on its spin axis , much like a child 's top			1
the tilt of the planet 's spin axis can vary by as much as 30 degrees over 11 years , leading to rapid and erratic changes in seasons			1
this illustration shows the unusual orbit of planet @entity5 around a close pair of orange and red dwarf stars			2
@entity5 413 - b is located 2,300 light - years away in the constellation @entity26			2
it circles a close pair of orange and red dwarf stars every 66 days			0
the next transit visible from @entity4 's point of view is not predicted to occur until 2020 , because the orbit moves up and down , a result of the wobbling , in such a great degree that it sometimes does not transit the stars as viewed from @entity4			2
' imagine living on a planet with seasons so erratic you would hardly know whether to wear @entity39 shorts or a heavy overcoat , ' @entity0 said			1
in contrast , @entity4 's rotational precession is 23.5 degrees over 26,000 years			1
researchers are amazed that this far - off planet is precessing on a human timescale			2
@entity5 413 - b is located 2,300 light - years away in the constellation @entity26			2
it circles a close pair of orange and red dwarf stars every 66 days			0
the planet 's orbit around the binary stars appears to wobble , too , because the plane of its orbit is tilted 2.5 degrees with respect to the plane of the star pair 's orbit			1
as seen from @entity4 , the wobbling orbit moves up and down continuously			0
@entity59 finds planets by noticing the dimming of a star or stars when a planet transits , or travels in front of them			2
this is the space telescope @entity59 's field of view , superimposed on the night sky so that the main stars are visible			1
in its four - year history , @entity59 has confirmed 132 planets , and found 2,700 new ones			0
some of the discoveries may harbour life astronomers using @entity5 discovered the wobbling when they found an unusual pattern of transiting for @entity5			2
' looking at the @entity5 data over the course of 1,500 days , we saw three transits in the first 180 days -- one transit every 66 days -- then we had 800 days with no transits at all			0
' after that , we saw five more transits in a row , ' said @entity88 , the principal investigator on the observation			0
the next transit visible from @entity4 's point of view is not predicted to occur until 2020 , because the orbit moves up and down , a result of the wobbling , in such a great degree that it sometimes does not transit the stars as viewed from @entity4			2
astronomers are still trying to explain why this planet is out of alignment with its stars			0
the kepler space telescope orbits around the @entity102 , 40 million miles from @entity4			1
it is named after @entity104 astronomer @entity59			0
it was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets			0
during that time it has confirmed 132 planets and spotted more than 2,700 potential ones			0
in december 2011 , @entity59 found a new @entity4 - sized planet orbiting a star just 352 light years away			1
it was found lurking in the @entity5 star field and was named @entity116			0
its parent star , the hd 179070 , is so close it can be viewed with a home telescope			0
@entity5 is a space observatory launched by @entity0 to discover @entity4 - like planets orbiting other stars			1
data from @entity5 could help humans find alien life however , @entity0 scientists said there ’s very little chance of it hosting life because the surface is a @entity133 ( @entity134 )			1
@entity5 's mission was supposed to be over by now , but last year @entity0 agreed to keep @entity5 running through 2016 at a cost of about £ 13 million ( $ 20 million ) a year			1
according to @entity0 scientists , there is , what 's dubbed , a ' @entity139 ' in space where the temperature is not too hot , or too cold , for water to exist in liquid form			1
any planets found in this zone could have life on them			0
if @entity5 is retired , @entity0 scientists believe the search for other lives on planets could be severely hindered			1
there could be other planetary bodies in the system that tilted the orbit			0
or , it could be that a third star nearby that is a visual companion may actually be gravitationally bound to the system and exerting an influence			0
' presumably there are planets out there like this one that we 're not seeing because we 're in the unfavorable period , ' said @entity168 , a team member with the @entity169 and @entity170			0
' and that 's one of the things that @entity88 is researching : is there a silent majority of things that we 're not seeing ? ' even with its changing seasons , @entity5 is too warm for life as we know it			1
because it orbits so close to the stars , its temperatures are too high for liquid water to exist , making it inhabitable			0
it also is a super @entity185 - a giant gas planet with a mass about 65 times that of @entity4 -- so there is no surface on which to stand .			0

unique planet discovered by @entity0 's kepler telescope wobbles on its axis
scientists say it could have extremely erratic seasons
tilt of the planet 's spin axis can vary by as much as 30 degrees over 11 years
