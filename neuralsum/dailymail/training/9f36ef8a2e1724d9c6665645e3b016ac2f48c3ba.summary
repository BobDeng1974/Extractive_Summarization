tragedy : a child died at a popular @entity26 campsite after shooting herself with her father 's gun emergency responders were unable to resuscitate the girl after her mother called emergency dispatchers according to a statement from park spokesperson @entity34			2
@entity34 described the tragedy as ' the kind of thing that is n't supposed to happen here			0
' a @entity39 law that took effect in 2010 allowed people to carry guns into national parks as long as federal , state and local firearms laws were met , according to the @entity46			0
the death comes three years after enactment of a federal law that lifted a decades - old ban on the possession of firearms by visitors to most national parks , including @entity11			2
uncommon : the girl was killed in a more populated section of the park known as @entity13 , which features a ranger station , stores , and other amenities			2
