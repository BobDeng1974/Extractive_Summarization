under the tough new ' no jab , no pay ' laws , social services minister @entity7 has announced on sunday that parents will no longer be able to access childcare benefits simply by signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on ' personal , philosophical or religious ' reasons			1
parents who refuse to immunised their children are set to lose up to $ 15,000 a year for every child when the changes come into force from january 1 , 2016			1
meanwhile , families who do vaccinate their kids are eligible for the $ 7,500 - a - year childcare rebate , $ 200 - a - week childcare benefit and the $ 726 @entity24 a end of year supplement			1
' we have had discussions with the @entity41 and have formed the view that this exemption is no longer current or necessary and will therefore be removed , ' minister @entity7 said			2
' having been informed the religion is not advising members to avoid vaccinating their children and following engagement with members , the government no longer sees that the exemption is current and the authorisation for this exemption has been withdrawn			2
