and now city cyclists could soon benefit from remote mobile technologies , with a new wave of smartphone gadgets , which promise to increase speed and improve security			0
@entity20 , for instance , provides riders with not only the ability to speed up with minimal effort but also to monitor and track their bicycle			2
once a rider starts peddling , the motor in the £ 340 @entity20 starts up , and begins making the ride easier			2
it has the ability to travel at up to 20 miles per hour for up to 30 miles and is powered by a lithium battery that can be fully recharged in just two to three hours			0
to use the @entity20 , riders set a top speed on the device ’s app , which is compatible with @entity46 and @entity48 devices			1
the @entity20 also acts as a gps tracker for the bike in the event it gets stolen and works as a security device by remotely locking the motor using the app the @entity56 is a standard bike u-lock that has a control unit and bluetooth module the @entity20 acts as a gps tracker for the bike in the event it gets stolen			1
it also works as a security device by remotely locking the motor using the app. the group behind the device have started a @entity69 campaign that now only has 39 days to go			1
they are currently $ 70,426 towards their $ 100,000			0
a separate project on @entity69 is hoping to speed the end for keys , by using a lock that can be opened with a press of a button if your phone is nearby			1
the @entity56 is a standard bike u-lock that has a control unit and bluetooth module			2
it has just one button , which you press to open - if the owner ’s phone is within range			0
press it again , and the lock is secured			0
it can communicate with @entity48 and @entity46 devices , and users can even give their friends access at set times , effectively running their own bike sharing scheme			0
the @entity56 also remembers where you 've parked using gps , and can send your bike ’s exact location to friends - or remind you			1

the lock is currently raising funds on @entity69 , and @entity114 inventor @entity113 claims it ‘ uses encryption found in online banking systems ’			1
however , he does warn ‘ you should not share access with anyone you do n’t trust			0
’ it ’s claimed the battery on the lock will last for 20 years , it 'll cost around £ 50 , and the u-lock itself is made from heat - treated steel and is reinforced for security .			0

the @entity20 can be monitored and tracked remotely via an app
the @entity56 , meanwhile , is a lock that can be opened only if you *'re* nearby
both projects are still raising funds via crowd - *sourcing* site @entity69
