another entry in @entity2 ’s little book , another dilemma for @entity4			1
how do you rest a man who , on current form , will comfortably keep @entity8 in the @entity9 ? that was the question niggling at @entity11 this weekend , barely a week after admitting he did not enjoy watching his side play			1
that he spent much of saturday wearing a huge grin says everything about the impact of a striker who has scored twice in three league games			2
@entity8 manager @entity4 ( right ) is delighted with the impact of striker @entity2 @entity2 ( third right ) scored for @entity8 in their 1 - 1 draw against @entity23 in the @entity9 @entity2 ( right ) celebrates with his @entity8 team - mates after scoring his second @entity8 goal @entity23 have not lost against a side from the bottom half of the table this season			1
the latest of those , a delightful strike against @entity23 , means he is the only striker to have scored against all 20 clubs in the @entity9			2
trivial , maybe , but goals are what @entity8 have lacked and they keep @entity2 interested			1
‘ things like that are always special to me , ’ @entity2 said			2
‘ i keep a note of things i ’ve done , a little incentive			0
‘ i just write down lists — sometimes it ’s things i ’ve done , sometimes it ’s things i want to do			0
it has n’t been much of a surprise			0
when you ’ve spent your whole career in the @entity9 it should not take you too long to get back into the swing of things			0
’ to that end , @entity4 is hoping for 10 goals from the 32 - year - old			1
@entity4 said : ‘ it was a perfect deal , signing @entity2			1
sometimes things happen for a reason and i hope it was that we deserved to get a player like @entity2			0
if he gets 10 goals we ’re going to finish in a very nice place			0
’ @entity57 ( centre ) scored @entity23 's goal as the match against @entity8 was drawn @entity4 believes that he can not afford to give @entity2 a rest while he keeps on finding the back of the net the dilemma comes from knowing @entity2 , whose opener on saturday was cancelled out by @entity57 , must be handed a break at some point			1
@entity4 said : ‘ when someone scores goals you can not drop him			0
he ’s going to have to die on the pitch			0

@entity2 has scored twice in his first three @entity8 games
he earned them a point in a 1 - 1 draw against @entity23 on saturday
manager @entity4 does not want to rest the in - form 32 - year - old
