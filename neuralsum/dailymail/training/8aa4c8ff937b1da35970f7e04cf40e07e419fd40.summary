he said : ' in the @entity36 one , all the regulators involved , whether it be in the @entity29 or in @entity38 , produced coordinated publication of reports which came out after the investigation was completed and they had made their judgments			0
' that 's very different from what 's happened in the @entity9 case where one regulator , but not the others , has gone public while the investigation is still going on			1
' but he insisted @entity29 authorities were not singling out @entity10 banks for attention , adding : ' clearly , if there has been wrongdoing , then action should certainly be taken			2
' @entity9 said yesterday it was continuing to cooperate with the @entity14 and four other @entity29 authorities : the @entity55 , the @entity56 , the @entity57 of @entity4 and the @entity58 of @entity4			1

the committee was also in charge of the company ’s ‘ speaking up ’ policy where staff could raise concerns in confidence			0
although there is no suggestion of wrong doing by @entity67 , the close ties with @entity9 are acutely embarrassing for the peer who has been touted as a leading contender to replace sir @entity2 as governor of the @entity7			2
the news comes amid calls for a full parliamentary inquiry into money laundering , prompted by the revelation that @entity130 is to be fined up to £ 600million for handling billions of pounds from @entity132 drug lords and rogue states			0

lord @entity149 , a former boss of @entity130 and another tip for the job , has been fending off calls to resign as trade minister after the bank was accused of money laundering			0
and @entity156 , @entity9 ’s chief executive , had also been tipped as an outside bet for the top job at @entity159			2
he is now fighting to salvage the bank ’s battered reputation and reassure panicked investors			0
@entity9 was accused on monday of being a ‘ rogue institution ’ and conspiring with @entity163 for much of the past decade to breach @entity29 sanctions			2
the @entity166 of @entity92 accused the bank of handling 60,000 secret transfers amounting to at least £ 160billion from @entity12 clients through its @entity4 office			1
these included state - owned banks suspected of funding the regime ’s nuclear weapons programme and groups such as @entity176 , @entity177 and the @entity72			0

this is alleged to have occurred between 2001 and 2010			0
according to the regulator ’s report lord @entity67 ’s committee was informed of the suspect behaviour in 2006			0
sources close to the peer point out that he had limited powers to stop payments and would have relied on information within the bank			0
@entity194 mp , a member of the @entity195 , yesterday called for a @entity10 parliamentary inquiry into money laundering			2
but he also accused @entity29 regulators of an @entity200 bias			0
