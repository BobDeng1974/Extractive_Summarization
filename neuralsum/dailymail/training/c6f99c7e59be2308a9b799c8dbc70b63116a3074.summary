@entity1 coach @entity0 is confident his side can overcome the shock of losing new captain @entity4 for their opening @entity7 clash with @entity8			1
the influential @entity9 loose forward , who was the logical choice to succeed @entity11 as captain of the national team , has failed to recover from a quad strain sustained in the @entity16 ' grand - final defeat by @entity17 10 days ago			1
former @entity17 skipper @entity18 will lead the side out at @entity21 's @entity20 for the first part of saturday 's double - header while @entity25 loose forward @entity24 will take over the number 13 jersey and win his first cap			1
@entity9 loose forward @entity4 will miss @entity1 's opening @entity7 clash with @entity8			1
' @entity4 tried his best and our medical staff tried their best but the @entity8 match has come too soon , ' @entity0 said			1
' we thought it was right that we made an early decision but we remain confident he 'll be ready for @entity36 the week after			2
' it 's a blow because he 's our leader and obviously he 's a really , really good player			2
' but i 'm really happy with his replacement			2
@entity24 had a great season for @entity25 , a team that did n't make the top eight , and to be a real stand - out for them shows what a quality player he is			1
@entity1 coach @entity0 is confident his team will cope without @entity4 ' @entity18 will step in as captain for this week and he 's a tremendous leader			1
we saw that with the ( @entity51 ) @entity50 towards the back end of the season when he single - handedly more or less led them to the @entity55			1
' he leads by example and gives 100 per cent effort in everything he does			2
he inspires everyone around him to follow his lead			1
' @entity18 , who is set to skipper his club in 2015 , took over the captaincy for @entity1 's 2010 @entity7 campaign in the southern hemisphere when @entity65 was forced to return home due to injury			1
@entity0 has named two other debutants in his starting line - up - @entity9 scrum - half @entity70 and @entity73 hooker @entity72 - while 2014 @entity75 @entity74 is set to make his @entity1 bow from the bench			1
former @entity17 skipper @entity18 will lead @entity1 against @entity8 at @entity21 's @entity20 ' there is a slight evolution to the squad this year with some new faces on show , ' @entity0 said			1
' the debutants are exciting and they can prove themselves on the international stage			2
' @entity72 , who will stay on in @entity36 at the end of the tour to take up a two - year contract with @entity88 , has been given the number nine jersey but @entity0 also expects the @entity90 - bound @entity74 to make an impact			2
' @entity92 ( the ) @entity75 and has been the best player in the competition this season so there is no doubting his ability , ' he said			2
' @entity72 is a tough , tenacious player and i think for this game , his robust start will help us			0
i think @entity103 's undoubted electric speed will also help us when he comes on when the sting goes out of the game			0
' @entity106 ( @entity16 ) ; @entity107 ( @entity9 ) , @entity108 ( @entity109 ) , @entity110 ( @entity111 ) , @entity112 ( @entity109 ) ; @entity113 ( @entity114 ) , @entity115 ( @entity9 ) ; @entity116 ( @entity117 ) , @entity118 ( @entity73 ) , @entity119 ( @entity50 , capt ) , @entity120 ( @entity9 ) , @entity121 ( @entity9 ) , @entity122 ( @entity25 )			1
replacements : @entity124 ( @entity111 ) , @entity125 ( @entity126 ) , @entity127 ( @entity117 ) , @entity128 ( @entity90 )			0
the only surprise is the selection of @entity131 , whose appearance in the @entity55 was only his seventh in rugby league since his return from a three - year stint in the 15 - man code , ahead of @entity140 second rower @entity138			0
' @entity131 is very experienced and a very good player , ' @entity0 said			0
' he fought his way back into the @entity9 team , played in a @entity55 and has been in this group before			1
he brings a whole lot of leadership and energy into the group			0
he 's a tremendous player to have back with us			0
' it will be @entity121 ' first appearance for three years alongside younger brother @entity151 , who is one of nine survivors from the team that lost 20 - 18 to @entity154 in their last match , their @entity157 semi-final at @entity158 11 months ago			0
the @entity140 - based players have been in @entity36 for less than a week but @entity0 is confident that by saturday his side will be ready for what could be a tricky opening test			0
' we 've only had nine days to get ready but we knew that from the outset , ' @entity0 said			0
' the thing with this group is that they are very intelligent players and you generally only have to tell them once or twice and they pick it up			0
' we 've got some great combinations going			0
ideally you would like to test them out in a game situation before the tournament but i 'm really confident			0
' @entity8 will make their @entity7 debut under a cloud after three players - @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 - were not considered for selection after it was revealed they are the subject of an @entity184 review into an alleged nightclub brawl in @entity21 over the weekend			1
' come game day , they will be past all of that , ' @entity0 said			0
' they will be ready for this game			0
i do n't think it will affect them			0
