by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s players have been losing up to two kilogrammes in weight in each training session during their @entity8 preparations			1
@entity9 has been keen to get his squad accustomed to the smouldering heat and humidity of @entity13 , in the @entity15 rainforest , where @entity3 start their campaign against @entity17 on saturday week			1
first he took them to @entity19 , where they trained in thermal layers and hats and gloves and then back to @entity24 where players were sent into the special heat chambers , where the temperature can be carefully controlled as they work on exercise machines			1
water break : @entity30 takes a drink during the training session ' we ’ve been really busy as well , ' said goalkeeper @entity34			0
' at @entity24 last week we were doing double sessions			1
we trained in the morning , had lunch and then everybody would literally have to go and have a bit of a sleep			0
' it ’s been kind of like pre-season and then at night we were doing bike sessions and heat chambers , where basically , you ’re in a sauna on a bike			2
we ’ve been doing half - hour sessions in there and it ’s brutal , really hard work			2
no one ’s grumbled or moaned about it , just got on with it			0
' when we were in @entity54 we wore under - armour , t - shirts , zip - up tops with wet top over that			0
so it ’s a lot of layers			0
when it was 22 degrees , the lads were losing two kilos in sweat in every training session			0
hot , hot heat : @entity68 and @entity69 take on fluids during the training session training in the heat : @entity9 stands in front of a giant fan as @entity3 train ' it ’s what goes with it			1
it ’s trying to replicate the heat and humidity out here			2
so we ’d be weighed before and after training , so you ’d know how much fluid you ’ve got to replace			0
' @entity9 has a large sports science team at his disposal to help get the necessary salts , minerals and electrolytes back into the players ’ bodies after they have sweated so heavily in the tropical climates			1
thirsty work : @entity95 drinks water during training the running boys : @entity3 goalkeepers @entity34 , @entity100 and @entity101 warm up in @entity102 as they trained in @entity102 ’s @entity105 ahead of wednesday 's friendly against @entity104 , the backroom team pulled out large drinks tubs , carefully labelled with the players ’ names because they all have individually tailored recovery drinks			1
some players will sweat more than others and in different ways , losing different minerals , and this has been carefully monitored by a series of tests taken since the squad first assembled two weeks ago			2
the pitch - side temperature in @entity102 yesterday was 27 degrees at 10.15am and there were four enormous propeller fans by the side of the pitch to help players cool down as they took drinks breaks between exercises			0
the game against @entity104 will kick - off at 3pm local time , so it is expected to be warmer , but still not as warm and humid as it is likely to be against @entity17 in @entity13			0
@entity130 will allow water - breaks during the @entity8 game if both teams agree , which @entity3 and @entity17 have .			1
