by @entity0 for @entity1 a man who was told he would never walk again after a childhood brain tumour left him confined to a wheelchair has defied the odds stacked against him to become a personal trainer			1
@entity7 , of @entity8 in @entity9 , underwent emergency surgery for a brain tumour when he was just nine years old			1
but the tumour robbed the now 22 - year - old of his sense of balance			1
he was left with permanent double vision and was confined to a wheelchair for the next two years , with specialists warning he would never stand or walk again			1
but after watching his school friends race around and play football in the park mr @entity7 was determined to defy their predictions			1
@entity26 , 22 , of @entity8 in @entity9 defied medics to become a personal trainer , even though doctors had told him he would never walk again after a childhood brain tumour left him in a wheelchair with the help of an eye patch mr @entity7 ( pictured left ) eventually overcame his lack of balance and embarked on his dream career - as a fitness instructor ( pictured right ) during his childhood @entity7 endured gruelling physio sessions to teach him to walk again , and he was so determined to play football he would practice for another five or six hours a day his resolve meant that over the course of his teens he slowly learned to stand and walk , then to run and play sports			1
and with the help of an eye patch he eventually overcame his lack of balance and embarked on his dream career - as a fitness instructor			1
mr @entity7 said it was devastating for a boy who loved sport to be told he would never walk again			1
he said : ‘ they told me that i would never walk again			2
i was absolutely gutted - i loved sport , i loved playing football			0
‘ lying in the hospital bed i was trying to get up on feet , mum and dad would help me down to try to stand up			0
‘ when i got home i saw my friends out playing football and i could n’t do anything			0
the brain tumour left mr @entity7 with double vision , with balance problems , and unable to walk before being diagnosed with a brain tumour that was causing excruciating headaches , mr @entity7 loved sports and games , especially playing football with his friends but practising every day meant he began to see positive results			1
he said : ‘ i had one hour ’s physio every other day but i would practise a good five to six hours every day			2
‘ i had to teach myself to walk again from scratch - it took a good two years			2
‘ but as soon as i started walking again , i noticed changes in myself , and i wanted to help others who had difficulty with fitness			0
’ wanting to spend his life helping people , mr @entity7 launched a personal training business as soon as he left school mr @entity7 started developing excruciating headaches as a boy and went to the doctors			1
eventually he was sent to a specialist who recognised the symptoms and rushed him into surgery that same day			1
the operation was a success , removing 90 per cent of the life threatening tumour , but left him wheelchair - bound with severe balance problems			1
determined not to give up on sport , he immediately started teaching himself how to walk and would get his parents to help him out of his hospital bed so he could attempt a few steps			0
he soon began gruelling hour - long physiotherapy sessions every other day , practising in his hallway for up to six hours a day , using the walls for balance			2
after two years he was finally able to walk and by the time he reached 15 he was back playing football with his friends			2
he decided he wanted to spend his life helping other people and after leaving school launched his own business , @entity107			0
he now hosts fitness classes , intense cardio sessions and goes to the gym himself five times a week			0
he said : ‘ i knew as soon as i left school what i wanted to do			0
‘ i did my first qualification about four years ago when i was 18 , ever since then i have been doing more			0
‘ my initial plan was to help people with disabilities , but i thought there would n’t be enough , so i started to help people who wanted to lose weight as well			0
’ he added that although he is still affected by his ordeal , his personal training allows him to focus on helping others achieve difficult goals			2
he said : ‘ my balance is still not perfect ; when i ’m walking i sometimes stumble			0
‘ i ’ve learnt to live with it and correct it and to just get on with it			0
now the goal is inspire others to overcome their biggest challenges			0
