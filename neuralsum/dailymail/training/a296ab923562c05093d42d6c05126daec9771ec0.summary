by @entity0 in 2006 , 12 - year - old in 2006 @entity1 saw a video comprising hundreds of self - portraits and was so inspired he began taking selfies and has become obsessed about taking one every day.saw a video of self - portraits that photographer @entity9 had uploaded to @entity10 – and decided to copy the idea			1
from that day , mr @entity1 has taken a selfie and now the resulting almost 3,000 photographs form the basis of a new video he has posted , three years ago , five years into his project he posted the video on social news site @entity18 ’s r / @entity20 section			1
he has compiled all the nearly 3,000 shots into a video and the last image taken when he was 19 is above right the one - minute video was so popular it appeared on the section ’s front page until it was taken down without explanation by moderators			1
at the time , mr @entity1 said that although he had missed a day or two , he was obsessed by selfies : ‘ i would take my laptop everywhere my family went			1
whether it was a holiday or to visit family for a few days , i always had to take my photo every single day , no matter what			1
hair tpday , gone tomorrow : @entity1 has missed only a couple of days of taking selfies the eyes have it : in none of the selfies does mr @entity1 crack a smile that was three years ago and mr @entity1 shows no sign of flagging as the new video lasting 1 minute 34 seconds shows			1
' it all started because my dad bought a time - lapse camera			2
i 'd seen similar videos but i realized no one had done it to document their teenage years			2
and i thought , " i want to create one , " ' he told the @entity62			2
' i knew i was going to change a lot physically in the next few years			2
' @entity1 was right - in the video , he goes from a smooth - cheeked pre-teen to a young man , complete with beard and requisite hair experimentation			1
it 's riveting to watch , and for @entity1 , the video has n't lost any of its fascination			1
' even single time i look at it it remind it 's amazing			0
it still has an effect on me , ' he said			0
even more amazing is that @entity1 did n't lose interest in the project in a bout of teen apathy			1
' i took the first 50 pictures and made a time - lapse video with them , and it was so cool			1
i did n't want to stop after that , ' he told @entity62			0
it became a habit for @entity1 , and he made sure to keep it up even while traveling in @entity92 or holidaying in @entity93 , using whatever method possible , including his mom 's @entity95			1
over seven years - roughly 2,500 days - he estimates he 's only missed about 50 days			1
' every time i would miss a day , i would feel bad			0
i would go on holiday and i 'd take a camera			2
no matter where i went , i really just had to do my photo			0
' hairy look : having experimented with an elaborate goatee , mr @entity1 goes the whole hog with a full beard mr @entity1 takes his selfies on his laptop and at times multi-tasks listening to his sounds ( right ) occasionally mr @entity1 ventured outside to take his selfies ( left ) and once in a while went for a new hairstyle and matched it with a beard but eschewed a moustache when he first began to post his videos , he called the project ' @entity114			1
' but with the rise of the selfie , @entity1 thought he 'd capture the zeitgeist and changed it to ' @entity120 , ' which he says has made his traffic rise exponentially			1
' changing it helped , ' he said of the name			0
' the trend has definitely helped my video			2
' but even @entity1 is amazed by the response to his latest cut			1
' i never expected it , it 's gone crazy			0
every two minutes there 's a comment , ' he said			0
the video has received hundreds of comments from its viewers			2
so far it has been seen by almost one and a half million people and the reaction has , it is fair to say , been mixed			0
while a viewer compliments @entity1 's looks , another compares watching the video to taking drugs another viewer thought that while @entity150 's 2014 film boyhood - shot over a 12 - year period - was not very good , she liked @entity1 's effort while @entity153 does not care for the video but cares enough to post a comment about it and while seven years is a long time to commit to a project , @entity1 has no plans to stop			1
' i 'm absolutely going to keep going			0
i 'm never going to stop			0
i 'm going to keep doing it forever , ' he told @entity62			0
' i 'm going to do it until i get old			0
the video will be me from 12 until literally wrinkles on my face			2
thinking about that is what makes me keep going			0
' my entire life in three minutes			0
that 's what inspires me to keep doing it			0
