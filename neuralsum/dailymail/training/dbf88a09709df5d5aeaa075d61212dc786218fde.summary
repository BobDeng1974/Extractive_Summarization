in the @entity2 boardroom on saturday there were hushed tones and quiet conversations taking place between the club ’s owners			1
it was the first time they had met since the resignation of sporting director @entity11 on thursday and the decision to pull the plug on the potential appointment of @entity15			1
they are numb , shocked by the nature of the allegations and disappointed that a valued member of the technical set - up at @entity21 has left			2
still , they have vowed to fill the void			0
decision maker : @entity25 ( right ) will choose @entity27 ' successor when the right candidate comes up tall order : parish knows he will find it hard in choosing someone who can match @entity34 ' success at the club @entity2 need a manager , someone to take them through the transfer window and beyond as they attempt to establish themselves in the @entity42			1
there is a temptation to appoint @entity45 , who served under @entity46 and @entity27 , as the interim manager until another name emerges			1
the transfer window is another added pressure and there is a feeling within the club that they need to add some names to a squad who finished 11th in the @entity42 last season			0
@entity45 has been speaking with the club ’s scouting staff this week and intends to put forward some names as @entity2 plan for the future			1
there is a perception within the game that @entity2 ’s co-chairman @entity25 picks the players and is reluctant to spend big on new recruits			2
the reality is he prefers to cut out the middle man , negotiating directly with the selling club in an attempt to cut costs			0
it is sensible planning , even if it grates with some agents			0
temporary charge : @entity45 has led @entity2 to two straight defeats in the club 's opening fixtures destroyer : @entity83 added more salt to @entity2 's wound by scoring @entity87 's third at @entity21 when @entity2 wanted to buy @entity88 from @entity89 in the summer , @entity25 phoned their chairman @entity90			1
a few days later , when @entity90 was trimming the fat from his squad at @entity89 , he offered @entity95 midfielder @entity94 to @entity2			2
in the summer , when @entity27 was plotting @entity2 ’s strategy , a budget of around £ 25 million was set aside for incoming players			1
@entity27 ’ name is a ghost in the corridors at @entity21 , stalking the club after he left , by mutual consent , 48 hours before the season ’s opener against @entity108			1
@entity2 are still wondering why he really left			2
until @entity27 breaks his silence , no one really knows			2
this week , in @entity2 ’s central @entity115 offices , @entity113 ’s email has been going off every few seconds with the cvs of managers all over the world			1
sometimes the introductions are so vague it is impossible to tell whether the candidate concerned even knows he has applied for the job			0
some managers have three , sometimes four , people claiming to be their official representative			0
unexpected departure : @entity27 decided the time was right to leave @entity2 after just 10 months at the club resignation : sporting director @entity11 ( centre ) had no choice but to resign from his role at @entity21 earlier in the week he had @entity133 there to help him , talking to agents and potential managers about the prospect of succeeding @entity27			1
all that changed when @entity11 went ‘ white as a sheet ’ after receiving a call from @entity140 about the text messages he exchanged with @entity15 when they were together at @entity142			0
within minutes he was sprinting to his lawyers and attempting to stop the story that ultimately led to his demise			0
identifying the next @entity2 manager is @entity113 ’s world now , sifting through applicants ranging from former @entity152 @entity151 captain @entity150 to @entity154 ’s @entity151 coach @entity153			1
in the running : @entity154 boss @entity153 ( left ) and @entity158 's @entity157 - winning captain @entity150 ( right ) have thrown their name in the hat none of them fits the bill			1
@entity113 wants someone who knows the ropes , a manager who has worked in the @entity42 and kept teams out of the bottom three			0
he is prepared to wait , just as he did when @entity46 left last october			0
until thursday , @entity113 had the option to appoint former @entity89 manager @entity171 , but he since withdrawn himself from a race he described yesterday as ‘ like the grand national ’			2
@entity2 want a manager with pedigree , a name the players will respond to on the training ground			0
@entity27 had that aura and was a commanding figure when he addressed the players			0
replacing him will not be easy .			0

former @entity2 boss @entity27 left 48 hours before @entity2 's league opener
