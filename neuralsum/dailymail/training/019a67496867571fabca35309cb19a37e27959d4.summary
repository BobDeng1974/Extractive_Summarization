by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 01:45 est , 21 june 2013 @entity2 passengers could see reduced fares after the @entity4 warned @entity5 and @entity6 they faced court action unless charges for passenger and freight trains using the @entity11 were reduced			1
the @entity4 said the illegally high track access charges result in higher ticket prices for passengers of the high - speed @entity2 service linking @entity16 with @entity17 and @entity18			1
both countries have been given two months to respond to the request			0
good news : @entity2 passengers could see a reduction in fares a spokesman for the @entity4 said today : ' passengers are paying over the odds for their tickets , freight operators and their customers are being overcharged , and overall the current regime is stifling growth in the rail sector			1
' she added the high charges meant only 43 per cent of the tunnel 's capacity was used			0
tunnel operator @entity37 charges a reservation fee of 4,320 euros one way for @entity2 trains and 16.60 euros per passenger			2
@entity43 officials said the charges should be roughly half that amount			0
@entity43 officials said if the charges were lower , the tunnel could make up the difference through increased freight traffic , forecasting a doubling of the amount of daily freight trains			2
under @entity43 law , rail companies are only allowed to charge fees consistent with the amount of wear caused by a train journey			0
clampdown : the @entity4 has said passengers are paying over the odds for their tickets			1
a @entity37 freight train is pictured emerging from the @entity11 but the officials said the @entity4 investigation found operators of the @entity11 were charging more than necessary and using the income to subsidise the operator 's car shuttle service , which does not pay such charges			1
officials said the tunnel had sought an exception to levy higher access charges to pay construction costs			2
they said the investigation did not find evidence to support this , and noted that @entity37 's financing costs declined significantly after a write - off in 2007			0
in addition to access charges , @entity4 regulators found that a 65 - year usage agreement that reserves 50 percent of traffic for @entity5 national rail operator @entity83 and @entity85 's @entity84 , a unit of @entity86 , violated @entity43 rules because of its length			1
the tunnel 's own rail regulator is also too weak , they said , and the railway operators have too much control .			0

@entity5 and @entity6 told to reduce charges for trains using @entity11
@entity4 said charges result in higher prices for passengers
