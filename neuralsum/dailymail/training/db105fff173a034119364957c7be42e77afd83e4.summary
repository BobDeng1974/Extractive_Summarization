extreme by @entity0 & @entity1 what kind of people are drawn to spend time in extreme environments ? not you or i , obviously			1
we ’ll read about such places , but we do n’t want to go there			2
but who are the men and women who climb the highest mountains , explore the poles , dive to the bottom of oceans and spend months on space stations ? not to put too fine a point on it , are they all halfway round the bend ? this is n’t actually a frivolous question , and psychologists @entity0 and @entity1 have seriously attempted to answer it in this rich and often compelling book			1
@entity28 ( left ) with his beard frozen during the @entity31 expedition and @entity32 ( right ) who was a member of captain @entity35 ’s @entity34 back - up team , and described polar exploration as ‘ the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised ’ test pilots , round - the - world yachtsmen and deep - cave explorers are not like the rest of us : they can not be			1
so what psychological and emotional qualities does a person need to survive , even thrive , in such circumstances ? some can not prepare enough			0
@entity32 was a member of captain @entity35 ’s @entity34 back - up team , and described polar exploration as ‘ the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised ’			1
the winter before @entity35 walked to the @entity50 — and his death — @entity32 and two companions were sent off into the @entity34 wilderness to collect emperor penguin eggs			1
it was pitch dark , temperatures hit minus 60c and each man needed rescuing after falling into deep crevasses			0
the cold was so intense that their teeth started to split			0
they even became frostbitten in their sleeping bags			0
five weeks later , they returned with three penguin eggs , but a decade later , @entity32 said that the expedition ‘ had beggared the language : no words could express its horror ’			1
@entity70 said people with endurance had ' the right stuff ' you may have what @entity70 called ‘ the right stuff ’			1
in 1952 , a test pilot called @entity78 took off in a jet aircraft minutes after seeing a fellow pilot die in a horrific crash			0
‘ @entity78 , who still had burn marks from a crash he had survived nine days earlier , was forced to taxi along one edge of the runway to avoid the smouldering wreckage of his friend ’s plane			1
the ability to overcome fear and manage anxiety is a prerequisite for coping with extremes			0
’ a chapter on loneliness is followed by a chapter on the difficulty of dealing with other people			1
even this is n’t as simple as it sounds			0
the traveller @entity103 was never lonely while walking barefoot across the @entity105 deserts , perennially thirsty , baking through the day , freezing at night			0
but put him down in a @entity107 city where he knew no one and he was miserable			0
‘ the worst loneliness , ’ he wrote , ‘ is to be lonely in a crowd			1
’ anxiety , meanwhile , afflicts even the best of them			2
@entity114 , skipper of the yacht that won the gruelling @entity117 race in 2009 - 10 , attributed his success , in part , to meticulous planning			0
‘ but thinking about all the potential dangers gave him sleepless nights before the start of every leg of the race			2
’ some experience such anxiety in real life they turn to extreme activities as a way of managing it			1
here ’s @entity131 , a cave diver known for chasing depth records : ‘ my personal life was this world of confusion , stress and fear in which i struggled on a daily basis to cope			1
diving was a place of peace and calm in which i excelled			0
’ many people go looking for excitement and find , instead , monotony			1
@entity146 , who went to the @entity147 with @entity148 , later wrote : ‘ funny thing happened on the way to the @entity147 : not much			1
should have brought some crossword puzzles			0
’ @entity146 , who went to the @entity147 with @entity148 , later wrote : ‘ funny thing happened on the way to the @entity147 : not much			1

’ so when @entity154 built the @entity156 space station in the early @entity157 , it brought in the industrial designer @entity159 for advice on habitability			2
many of his suggestions are now standard in confined environments : moveable furniture , varied colour schemes , plants for you to water			2
for @entity156 , his most controversial suggestion was a window for the astronauts to look out of			0
but for the mental health of the astronauts , it turned out to be essential			0
as one said , ‘ all the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18ft by 20ft and leave them together for two months ’			2
people do indeed fall out			2
in 1959 , a @entity187 scientist killed another scientist with an ice pick after an argument over a game of chess			0
the @entity187 ’s response was to ban chess at its @entity34 stations			1
and what of the loved ones all these maniacs leave behind ? the climber @entity199 argued that mountaineers who keep on taking big risks are ‘ either profoundly selfish , or incapable of sympathy for those who love them ’			1
one climber ’s wife even admitted to feeling an instant of relief when she heard her husband had died , because at least she would n’t have worry about him dying any longer			2
it will probably be no surprise that there is n’t one sort of person who is drawn to these exploits , or one sort of person who excels at them			0
as in real life , it takes all sorts			0
the climber @entity199 argued that mountaineers who keep on taking big risks are ‘ either profoundly selfish , or incapable of sympathy for those who love them ’ there ’s only one kind of individual you really want to avoid			1
as the guitar - playing astronaut @entity235 put it : ‘ no one wants to go into space with a jerk			2

what draws people to extreme environments ?
psychologists explore whether the most adventurous are also *unstable*

@entity70 said people with endurance had ' the right stuff '
@entity146 went to the @entity147 with @entity148
he said it was a dull experience
