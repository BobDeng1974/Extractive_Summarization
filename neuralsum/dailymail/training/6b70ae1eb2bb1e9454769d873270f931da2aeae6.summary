by @entity1 reporter published : 14:15 est , 7 february 2014 @entity3 : 15:37 est , 7 february 2014 as @entity1 diarist @entity5 revealed in his column this morning , the busy @entity4 have proved a touch forgetful when it comes to their pets			1
family goldfish @entity11 has spent the last month ensconced in a tank at their @entity15 neighbour 's home after @entity17 dropped her off on @entity18 and forgot ( or so we assume ) to pick her up			1
' you can forgive the @entity4 for being a little distracted following their move to a new £ 30 million mansion in @entity15 ’s @entity23 , ' wrote @entity5			2
' but could they not spare a thought for their lonely goldfish ? ' @entity28 goldfish he continued : ' @entity17 dropped off the pet fish with a neighbour to look after for the holiday season on @entity18 last year — and is yet to reclaim it			1
' ' the goldfish just came with some fish food , ’ says neighbour , military historian @entity34 , who lives on the street in @entity23 where the @entity4 rented prior to their move			1
‘ we believe it belongs to their son @entity40 , so we ’ve called it @entity11			2
’ mr @entity34 , who with his wife is caring for the fish , added : ‘ it seems quite chirpy , but i ca n’t help thinking it ’s pining for its celebrity lifestyle			1
’ and it seems mr @entity34 could be correct			2
speaking to @entity5 , animal psychologist dr @entity49 revealed the fish may indeed be pining for its ritzy owners			0
busy : the @entity4 dropped @entity11 off with neighbours on @entity18 and have n't been back since luxurious : the leafy @entity55 street where @entity56 and @entity17 recently bought a £ 30m mansion ‘ goldfish are pretty adaptable			1
but they are also incredibly olfactory			0
they notice smell , lighting , pollution , ' he explained			0
‘ so this fish could pick up the different body perfumes in its new home , as odours can dissolve in the water in their tank			2
’ @entity49 also believes @entity11 needs a piscatorial pal , reports @entity5			0
‘ i think it ’s a bad idea to keep just one goldfish — they are fundamentally sociable animals			0
and it is horrible to think about a fish swimming round and round in circles with nothing to do			0
they need structured tanks with places to hide , and architecture to explore			0
’ adds mr @entity34 : ‘ the fish came in a plain bowl , but we ’ve bought it a tank with a filter as the water was getting murky			1
we ’re happy to keep it , but it would be nice too , if they came to collect it			0

the fish , named @entity11 , has been at a *neigbour* 's home since @entity18
@entity17 apparently dropped the creature off and has n't been back since
@entity34 says he hopes the @entity4 will return for their pet fish
