the player who two years ago declared his desire to stay at @entity2 forever is set to become only the seventh to leave the club for @entity5			1
@entity6 is expected to put pen to paper on a transfer that is almost as curious as it is rare			2
it is understood that the @entity13 defender has agreed verbally to terms worth £ 100,000 - a - week to join @entity15 at @entity16 , with a fee of less than £ 10million mooted for the 28 - year - old			1
the passage for such a move – not as contentious as @entity21 ’s a couple of years back but surprising nonetheless – has been partially cleared by @entity6 sharing an agent with @entity24 and , with only one year remaining on his deal , @entity6 is believed to want a change			1
per @entity43 has emerged into a quality centre - half after initial , significant doubts that he could adapt to the pace of @entity48 ’s top division			0
@entity49 has tended to use @entity50 alongside him , meaning @entity2 ’s captain has been in the strange position of commanding respect but not holding a place in the team			0
@entity49 is believed to want to keep him , but the trends for @entity6 have largely convinced him to make a move			2
he made 33 @entity59 appearances in his first season after joining from @entity61 , but missed large chunks of 2010 and 2011 with an @entity64 problem			0
he recovered to reclaim his place in the side , and resumed his threat as a goal - scoring centre - half , but last season played only 14 top - flight games , seven of which were starts , and was often used on the left			2
first choice : @entity77 central defender @entity43 has kept @entity6 out of the side at the @entity79 @entity5 no more : @entity81 columnist @entity80 also left @entity16 at the end of last season on the stretch : @entity6 is currently away at the @entity35 in @entity84 with @entity85 all of which might make him seem a curious choice for @entity5 , as they look to rebuild the centre of their defence following the fantastic pairing of @entity39 and @entity80			1
@entity80 is currently without a club having apparently come to the end of a long line at the top of the top level , while @entity39 has been handed a lucrative deal at @entity40			1
at the time the move was agreed , @entity41 said it was a move that suited both parties , though there are plenty who disagree			0
now it looks as though @entity6 will step into the breach			0
@entity107 does n’t tend to get much wrong , by all accounts , so it will be fascinating to see what kind of impact @entity6 makes if and when a fee is agreed .			0

@entity6 set for £ 10m move to @entity16 from the @entity115
central defender primed to earn £ 100,000 - a - week
@entity80 and @entity39 left @entity5 at the end of the season
