by @entity0 last updated at 1:04 am on 26th december 2011 the thugs behind this summer ’s riots were no worse than @entity6 ’s bankers , the archbishop of @entity2 suggested yesterday			2
delivering his @entity9 sermon at @entity10 , @entity7 claimed society had been torn apart by the violence that erupted in august			1
‘ the most pressing question we now face , we might well say , is who and where we are as a society , ’ said dr @entity7			1
‘ @entity19 have been broken , trust abused and lost			1
the archbishop of @entity2 , dr @entity7 gives his @entity9 address at @entity10 ‘ whether it is an urban rioter mindlessly burning down a small shop that serves his community , or a speculator turning his back on the question of who bears the ultimate cost for his acquisitive adventures in the virtual reality of today ’s financial world , the picture is of atoms spinning apart in the dark			1
‘ and into that dark the @entity38 has entered , in love and judgment , and has not been overcome ; in the darkness the question sounds as clear as ever , to each of us and to our church and our society : “ @entity6 , where are you ? ” where are the words we can use to answer ? ’ he asked the congregation to learn lessons about mutual obligation from the events of the past year			1
his comments , which formed part of his closing remarks , will undoubtedly spark debate among those who claim the rioters were crying out for help and those who believe their behaviour was wanton vandalism			2
making reference to the @entity62 , which reaches its 350th anniversary next year , the @entity1 said it was an example of how ideas of duty and common interest can be expressed			2
@entity68 : silhouetted against a blazing building , riot officers in formation prepare for the next wave of attack during the summer 's riots ‘ the world has changed , the very rhythms of our speech have changed , our society is irreversibly more plural , and we have – with varying degrees of reluctance – found other and usually less resonant ways of talking to @entity84 and identifying who we are in his presence , ’ he said			0
‘ if we used only the @entity87 these days we ’d risk confusing the strangeness of the mysteries of faith with the strangeness of antique and lovely language			0
' but we ’re much the poorer for forgetting it and pushing it to the margins as much as we often do in the @entity96			0
and it is crucial to remember the point about the @entity87 as something for a whole society , binding together our obligations to @entity84 and to one another , in a dense interweaving of love and duty joyfully performed			0
’ it is not the first time the archbishop has highlighted august ’s disturbances , which spread from @entity68 in @entity110 to cities across the country , including @entity113 and @entity114			0
earlier this month he spoke about the ‘ enormous sadness ’ he felt during the riots , watching homes and shops being destroyed			0
in his spiritual message , the archbishop of @entity121 , dr @entity120 , called for @entity6 to turn their backs on materialism and remember the meaning of @entity9			1
‘ the message of @entity9 is clearly about that authentic peace child , @entity127 , ’ he said .			0

' @entity19 have been broken , trust abused and lost ' , dr @entity7 tells congregation
