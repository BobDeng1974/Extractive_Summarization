by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 17:45 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 17:49 est , 14 october 2013 ministers were accused last night of betraying pensioners over a pledge they will not have to sell their homes to fund care			2
the @entity7 had promised that no one would have to meet the cost while they were alive			0
it said government - backed loans would cover hiring home helps and care home fees , and be repaid from the person ’s estate after they had died			2
but yesterday it emerged that , far from being universal as billed , the ‘ deferred payment ’ scheme will apply as a matter of course only to those with other assets of less than £ 23,500			1
ministers have been accused of betraying thousands of middle class pensioners over a pledge they would not have to sell their home to fund care in old age the @entity29 heard that the apparent u-turn means tens of thousands of middle - class pensioners will still have to go through the trauma of selling their homes , denying their children an inheritance			1
‘ this has been done in a back - door manner which disgraces the government , ’ said @entity37			1
‘ the government has welshed on the deal			0
’ it will be up to local councils to decide whether pensioners with assets that exceed £ 23,250 , excluding their property , can have a loan , the @entity29 heard			0
restricting funding to people with assets less than £ 23,500 means up to 40,000 people might have to sell up every year to fund care when @entity54 , then health secretary , announced the scheme in july last year , it was called ‘ universal deferred payments ’ – making no mention of a cut - off and giving the clear impression that everyone would be covered			1
‘ from april 2015 , we will ensure that people will be able to delay selling their home to pay for residential care , ’ he said his announcement followed a report in 2011 by the @entity67 – set up by the @entity7 to examine how to fund the spiralling cost of care , which currently forces tens of thousands to sell their homes each year			2
its main recommendation was to limit individuals ’ contribution to social care costs to £ 35,000 , after which the state would pay			0
the government is proposing to implement a cap on care costs of £ 71,000 to come into force in 2016			0
however this cap will not include the ‘ bed and board ’ costs of a care home – some £ 10,000 a year			1
@entity37 , a member of a @entity86 in the 1990s on the funding of care for the elderly , told peers : ‘ the original scheme as put forward by the @entity67 has had its b * * * * cut off by the government			2
‘ there is now a huge restriction which will mean that very few people will take advantage of the deferred payment scheme			1
@entity99 said the ' huge restriction means ' very few people ' will use the scheme when @entity54 , then health secretary , announced the scheme , it was called ' universal deferred payments ' ¿ making no mention of a cut - off ‘ if you have got more than that you have to spend down until you get to £ 23,250 in the bank or wherever it is and then you can consider a deferred payment scheme			1
‘ most people who have reasonably valuable houses – and they are most of the people who are likely to be wanting this – will have far more than £ 23,250 in other assets and most of them wo n’t feel the least bit happy if before they can get any help from the deferred payment scheme they have to spend down until they have got less than £ 23,250			1
’ health minister @entity119 admitted up to 40,000 people might have to sell their homes every year but denied that the @entity67 recommendations had been emasculated			1
he said there would be circumstances where local authorities must offer deferred payments but the proposed legislation provided additional powers to offer deferred payments more widely			0
the government was consulting on this			0
‘ we need to ensure that this arrangement is rolled out in a way that is financially sustainable for the local authority in each case , ’ he said			0
urging ministers to think again , @entity37 warned of a ‘ tsunami ’ of opposition to the government ’s plans			0
@entity143 ’s lord @entity142 , a member of the @entity67 , said it was ‘ pretty rough ’ for the government to give the impression that it was implementing its recommendations on deferred payments ‘ when they palpably are n’t ’ .			0
