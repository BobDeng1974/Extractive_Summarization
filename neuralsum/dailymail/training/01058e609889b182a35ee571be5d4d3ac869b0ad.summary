in the era of social networking sites , it has become common practice to tailor our photos so we come across in a certain way			1
but now there 's a whole new audience that ' selfie ' fans need to take into consideration			0
big brands have started using state - of - the - art computer software to scan the swathes of photos posted on sites such as @entity17 for clues about their prospective customers			1
companies such as @entity21 are using a new image recognition software to track their logos - as well as 2,500 other ' details ' - in the 1.8billion photos that flood social networking sites each day			1
the program , created by @entity45 in @entity46 , also ' reads ' the background , the person 's clothing and even the location of the photo in a bid to glean as much information as possible as the customer and how they view the product or brand			1
the wealth of information is then used to set up a profile which spells out exactly how that customer should be targeted by advertisers			1
the pioneering software is a dream for marketing firms , allowing them to carry out extensive research while barely lifting a finger			0
but liberty rights campaigners have warned the process goes ' far beyond ' what most users should expect and that companies should seek permission before passing on the information to third parties			1
@entity77 , director of @entity78 , a campaign group set up to challenge policies which it believes threatens privacy , told @entity81 : ' social media companies are well within their rights to scan photos for marketing purposes , which will certainly come as a surprise to many users			1
' we are all very used to receiving targeted adverts based on the information we provide about ourselves online , whether that be via our emails or status updates , but scanning our photos for logos and certain backdrops will go far beyond what many would expect companies to do with the photos we post			1
the website shows how the @entity102 software scans photos of a range of brands so companies can garner information about prospective customers ' if companies want to use our data in this way , explicit permission should be sought			1
it is also only right that users ask for complete transparency about what data will be collected , analysed and who it will be sold on to			0
' the program - which computer scientists began creating more than a decade ago - is already being used by brands owned by @entity123 , which handles hair care company @entity124 and @entity126 other brands include @entity128 , which , through the program , discovered that 13 per cent of its ' @entity128 population ' are also interested in @entity130			1
ditto - which also has companies such as @entity134 and @entity135 's within its portfolio - has also already worked with @entity137 , helping it find that beer drinking generally peaks at 11pm			2
according to @entity102 , the software ' unlocks brand data hidden inside the millions of photos uploaded each day ' in a bid to ' discover photos with brands and make those photos actionable for marketers '			1
the proprietary logo detection engine within the software is trained to scan for up to 2,500 details in each photo - ranging from brand logos to fabric patterns			0
the software also uses geocoding information - which uses longitude and latitude statistics - to find where the image has been taken			2
the program then uses an interface to access information about who posts images with the logo , by analysing faces in the image and their ' corresponding facial mood score ( @entity170 ) '			2
the software works across a range of social media platforms , including @entity17 , @entity174 and @entity175			1
@entity176 , chief executive , told @entity177 that the primary use of the software was ' listening ' , adding : ' so they know how the product packaging should be changed or who they should be aligning with for sponsorship			0
' say that you 're @entity185			0
how does @entity185 make a good case for bringing in new sponsorship ? they can look at photos of people in @entity185 branded clothing and see what other brands appear			2
' according to the site , the software ' unlocks brand data hidden inside the millions of photos uploaded each day '			2
it claims to identify brands in every photo to ' make those photos actionable for marketers '			2
the website explains that the company 's ' proprietary computer vision ' is trained to scan for 2,500 details in each photo , ranging from brand logos to fabric patterns			0
the software can also detect where the photo is taken by using geocoding information			0
the geocoding uses longitude and latitude statistics to locate the exact position of the camera			0
the company describes how the software can also ' access information about who posts images with your logo ' by tracking ' faces in the image and their corresponding facial mood score ( @entity170 ) '			1
earlier this year , a team of @entity231 researchers developed an advanced image classification and detection program called @entity234 the programme can locate and distinguish between a range of object sizes within a single image			0
it can also determine an object within , or on top of , an object , within the photo			0
@entity231 has made the software open to other developers , to help increase its accuracy			0
in the future , the technology could be used to improve @entity250 searches			0
it could also scour @entity253 videos for specific objects or shapes .			0

1.8bn photos are posted every day to social media sites such as @entity17
