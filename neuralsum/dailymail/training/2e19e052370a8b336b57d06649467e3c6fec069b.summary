the @entity10 put in two fast runs in the final 12 - minute qualifying session to claim an eighth pole of the season as he looks to close the three - point gap @entity5 holds at the top of the championship standings			1

@entity5 was quicker in @entity36 , albeit by just 0.060 seconds , with @entity0 setting the pace in @entity38 with an even smaller gap back to his team - mate			1
the top three qualifiers @entity5 ( left ) , @entity0 and @entity30 ( right ) wave to fans in @entity44 but @entity5 , who had crashed out late on in final practice , had no answer to his rival in the final and most telling session as @entity0 , who expressed his disappointment on missing out on pole in @entity51 with a cry of ' damn it ' over his team radio , was much happier this time out			1
the gap between the title contenders was less than two tenths with the @entity8 locking out the top two spots for every session of the weekend			2

@entity5 and @entity8 team - mate @entity0 locked out the top two spots for every qualifying session @entity63 , who looks to be moving on from @entity64 with @entity65 set to step in , took fifth and was over eight - tenths quicker than team - mate @entity67 - who was 10th , having had a new power unit installed before qualifying began			1
@entity65 's departure from @entity71 was confirmed on saturday morning and he had a poor session , only able to seal ninth place having had problems in free practice			2
the sister @entity71 of @entity77 qualified sixth , with the @entity79 pair of @entity80 and @entity81 also quicker than @entity65			0
both @entity0 and @entity5 are now preparing for what looks increasingly like being a wet race , with the former of the opinion that rain could increase their margin over the chasing pack			2
@entity65 , whose departure from @entity71 was confirmed on saturday , was only able to seal ninth place ' i 'm here to try and win and it was a great day today , ' said @entity0			0
' it is only one step on the way but it was a real pleasure today because the car is so amazing to drive			0
' we are as prepared as we can be - we are expecting it to be wet			0

' @entity5 ( left ) praised the speed shown by @entity0 @entity5 praised the speed shown by @entity0 and admitted he was not quite hooked up for the session			2

@entity125 struggled to 14th with the @entity126 of @entity127 and @entity128 15th and 16th respectively			0
it was a disappointing qualifying session for @entity130 - who lost both cars in @entity36 as pastor @entity133 and @entity134 were pushed into the knock - out zone by two impressive late laps by the @entity138 pair			1
@entity133 will start at the back of the grid after being handed a 10 - place grid penalty after fitting a sixth engine of the season , with his lowly qualifying performance meaning five of those penalty places will be carried over to the @entity147 next weekend			1
@entity148 has looked quicker than his @entity150 team - mate , as well as the @entity152 cars , and he once again beat all three of his nearest competitors and will start 18th			1
@entity154 is the lead @entity152 as he out - qualified @entity156 , with the home favourite @entity158 sandwiched in - between the duo in the second @entity150			0
