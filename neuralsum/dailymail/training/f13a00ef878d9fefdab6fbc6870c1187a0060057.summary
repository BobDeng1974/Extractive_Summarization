@entity0 , the 10 - year - old @entity1 girl suffering from cystic fibrosis whose parents launched a national campaign to get onto an adult organ donor list , has successfully undergone surgery and received a new set of lungs			1
her mother , @entity9 posted on @entity10 at around 8 p.m. wednesday that her daughter was out of surgery and that doctors are ' very pleased with both her progress during the procedure and her prognosis for recovery			1
' @entity0 went into surgery at around 11 a.m. this morning , and her parents were briefed on her progress throughout the six hour procedure			2
surgeons had no challenges resizing or transplanting the lungs			0
now out of surgery , @entity0 is settling into an intensive care unit - the beginning of her recovery			2
' we expect it will be a long road , but we 're not going for easy , we 're going for possible , ' @entity0 's mother wrote on @entity10			1
' and an organ donor has made this possible for her			0
' @entity43 is great ! he moved the mountain ! @entity0 got the call , ' a statement posted on her @entity10 page wednesday read			1
' please pray for @entity0 's donor , her hero , who has given her the gift of life			1
' the plight of the ailing child suffering from an end - stage lung disease has touched off a national debate over organ transplant policies , which until now barred children younger than 12 from the adult waiting list			1
at around 11am wednesday , @entity0 's mother shared with her @entity10 followers that her daughter will be heading to the operating room in 30 minutes after the family were notified that a set of lungs has become available for transplant , as @entity69 first reported			1
' please pray for @entity0 and her surgical team and our whole family ! we are overwhelmed with emotions ! ! ! ! thank you to all of you for the unending support , ' she wrote			2
' today is the start of @entity0 's new beginning and new life ! ' on wednesday afternoon , @entity0 's mother spoke to a reporter from @entity80 about her daughter 's searching , describing the family as being nervous but ' excited ' about the surgery because doctors had given her child about a week to live , and they were out of options			1
the mother went on to say that they got the news that a set of suitable lungs have become available at around 10.30pm tuesday			2
however , the @entity92 waited until this morning to share the good news with their supporters and the media in case the surgery got canceled in the last minute , which had happened three times in the past			0
' we 're just so thankful for the donor , ' @entity9 said , adding that while it is a great day for her , it is not lost on her that it is a tragic day for the donor 's family , who had lost a loved one , and that they are grateful to them			0
recalling her final moments before @entity0 was wheeled into surgery , her mother said that she gave her a kiss but was unable to say tell her anything because the 10 - year - old has been in a medically induced coma since saturday			1
' they intubated her , she 's paralyzed , she 's not breathing on her own , so i â€™m not sure how much she 's understanding me , ' the mother said			2
according to the girl 's mother , it may take as long as eight hours before @entity0 wakes up , and the fact that she had spent two days in a coma would likely make her recovery more difficult , but the family remain optimistic			1
last - minute miracle : @entity0 's mother , @entity128 , described the family as being nervous but ' excited ' about the surgery because doctors had given her child about a week to live ' we 're getting new lungs , so she has a chance , ' she said			1
' she 's a fighter			0
' last week , the @entity92 scored a major victory when a judge ordered the @entity137 to add the 10 - year - old to the list for adult lungs			1
the family 's battle waged in the media and on social networks has inspired other parents of children in dire need of organ transplants to challenge the existing lung allocation process			2
@entity150 , 11 , who suffers from the same illness as @entity0 , is now also awaiting a new set of lungs at @entity154 , where the little girl is currently undergoing surgery			2
on wednesday , mrs @entity0 said that had it not been for the judge 's recent ruling , they would not have gotten this set of lungs , which likely came from an adult or teenager			1
' @entity0 would 've been number 400 or something on the list , ' she said			2
the @entity137 added the 10 - year - old to the list on wednesday night after @entity172 district judge @entity171 's original ruling on june 5th @entity172 @entity174 secretary @entity173 said last thursday			1
the little girl , also remains on the priority list for a lung from a pediatric donor , @entity173 said			2
however , her family , through their official spokeswoman , said @entity0 's condition had worsened			1
@entity0 's parents had challenged existing transplant policy that made children under 12 wait for pediatric lungs to become available , or be offered lungs donated by adults after adolescents and adults on the waiting list had been considered			1
' we are beyond thrilled , ' @entity191 told @entity193 on wednesday			0
' obviously we still need a match			0
' the ruling applied only to @entity0 , who has end - stage cystic fibrosis and has been awaiting a transplant at the @entity154			2
an expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds			0
in this may 30 , 2013 file photo provided by the @entity0 family , @entity0 , center , celebrates the 100th day of her stay in @entity154 with her father , @entity205 , left , and mother , @entity206 loved : her mother @entity206 , pictured , has just learned her daughter has a chance to live - after being approved for the adult organ transplant waiting list lung transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants , and children fare worse than adults , which is one reason for the existing policy , said dr. @entity218 , a bioethicist at @entity219			1
he called it troubling , and perhaps precedent - setting , for a judge to overrule that medical judgment , and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who do n't like their place on the waiting list			1
' i 'm not sure i want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside , ' @entity218 said			0
@entity0 's family , who live @entity236 in suburban @entity237 , filed suit wednesday			1
the @entity92 say pediatric lungs are rarely donated , so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations			0
@entity171 suspended the age limit in the nation 's transplant rules for 10 days for @entity0 , who has been at the @entity237 hospital for three months			1
a june 14 hearing on the request has been scheduled for a broader injunction			0
holding on : @entity0 's mother said her eldest daughter has just three to five weeks left to live support : @entity0 , who has been living in hospital since february , is pictured with her three younger siblings nationwide , about 1,700 people are on the waiting list for a lung transplant , including 31 children under age 11 , according to the @entity137			1
@entity173 had declined to become involved in the case earlier this week , despite urgent pleas from several @entity1 congressmen			0
@entity173 said there were three other children at @entity154 alone in the same condition as @entity0			2
she has called for a review of pediatric transplant policies amid the higher death rates for pediatric patients , but the @entity92 say @entity0 does n't have time for that			2
@entity0 's doctors , one of whom testified wednesday at an emergency hearing before @entity171 , believe they can perform a successful transplant on her with adult lungs			1
' she definitely understands things have improved quite a bit , ' the girl 's aunt , @entity34 , said after the ruling			0
the @entity92 ' attorney , @entity284 , said a committee of the organization that sets transplants policy may meet next week and he hoped it would change the policy			0
' i hope that they decide to discontinue it completely for children under 12			0
i wo n't be satisfied until @entity0 receives a set of lungs , ' he said			0
' the risk of her dying until she gets those lungs is high			0
' @entity298 , spokesman for the @entity137 that operates the nation 's transplant network , said he was unaware of any previous court order that overruled a transplant policy			1
' incredibly agonizing ' : @entity172 @entity174 secretary @entity173 told a congressional panel on tuesday that she would n't overrule federal regulations to help save young @entity206 @entity306 : despite her poor prognosis , @entity0 remains upbeat about her chances of getting a transplant fears : @entity206 and @entity311 are now hopeful their daughter 's life will be saved after she was placed on the adult transplant list while many more adult lungs than children 's lungs wind up being donated , the ruling does n't guarantee @entity0 a new set of lungs			1
the matches are based on blood type , the risk of dying , the chance of surviving a transplant and other medical factors			0
the donor lungs would also have to be an appropriate size for her chest			0
@entity298 said some lungs donated from deceased adults have been offered for children 's transplants over the past two years , although he could n't give a number			0
but he said all were turned down by the children 's surgeons			0
the @entity137 system was established to avoid bias in determining who gets organs , thus ensuring that the rich or celebrities , for example , do n't have a better chance , @entity218 noted			0
he said it is transparent , with policies open to public comment and scrutiny before they 're enacted			0
' when a judge steps in and says , ' i do n't like these rules , i think they 're arbitrary , ' they better be very arbitrary or he 's undermining the authority of the whole system			0
why would n't anybody sue ? '			0

at around 8 p.m. wednesday , @entity0 's mother *announced* on @entity10 that her daughter was out of surgery and that doctor 's said it went well
the national organ transplant network has complied with a judge 's *unusual* order and placed @entity0 , 10 , on the adult waiting list
doctors gave her only three to five weeks without a lung transplant
@entity172 health secretary @entity173 refused on tuesday to overrule a federal regulation which states a patient has to 12 to get an adult transplant
