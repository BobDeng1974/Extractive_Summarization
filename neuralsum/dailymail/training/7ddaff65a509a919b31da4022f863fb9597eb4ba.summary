by @entity0 students will be asked to analyse the speeches of @entity3 and @entity4 as part of their @entity7 gcses			1
they are also scrutinising the commentaries of international cricket matches and transcripts of @entity12 tv cookery programmes			2
it comes after recent exams have asked pupils to analyse the rambling armchair stories of @entity17 and @entity19 ’s performances , fuelling the argument of those who claim the exams are being ‘ dumbed down ’			2
former prime minister @entity3 , left , and @entity22 mayor @entity4 , right , are both politicians who could see their speeches analysed in the exams			2
@entity3 's addresses on the death of princess @entity28 and the eve of the @entity30 are two of the texts students could find themselves studying transcripts of television programmes , such as cookery show the @entity12 , will also form part of the exams pupils studying @entity7 with the @entity41 exam board must write an essay on extracts of spoken language – worth 10 per cent of the marks			1
but critics have questioned why pupils are being encouraged to study the language of tv hosts and entertainers rather than great orators such as @entity51 and @entity52			2
the exams are among those facing the axe in a radical exam overhaul			0
even the commentaries on sporting events , such as international cricket matches , could form part of courses education secretary @entity62 has ordered examiners to rethink gcses in @entity7 and other core subjects to counter apparent dumbing down			1
as part of the changes , being phased in from next year , so - called ‘ controlled assessments ’ – such as the spoken language assignment – will be scrapped and all marks will rest on performance in final exams			1
but teachers preparing pupils for exams in 2015 have been told that youngsters can study either @entity3 , @entity22 mayor @entity4 or comic @entity78			0
critics of the courses say students should study history 's great orators , such as @entity85 's prime minister during the @entity86 , @entity51 , left , and @entity88 's president during the country 's civil war , @entity52 , right , who gave famous speeches such as the @entity92 they are then given four hours of classroom time to complete a 1,000 - word essay on the spoken language of their chosen person			1
education secretary @entity62 has launched a crusade against what he sees as the ' dumbing down ' of exams schools are allowed free rein as to which of @entity3 ’s speeches they select but his ‘ @entity28 ’ speech on the death of @entity28 is known to be among those chosen , as is his address to the @entity111 people on the eve of war			1
guidance to schools says pupils should focus on how the speaker establishes a rapport with the audience , how they create impact with their speech and how they use techniques such as timing and pace			1
the interviews of @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 have also made it onto the syllabus , as have transcripts of commentaries of cricket matches and the men ’s @entity136 singles final			0
extracts from cookery shows hosted by the @entity12 , @entity140 and @entity141 have also been considered suitable material			0
one recent year saw the examining board use the @entity144 , @entity145 and comedian @entity146 as speakers to be studied			0
@entity148 , chairman of the @entity149 , said : ‘ it is important that children are not denied access to speeches that have stood the test of time			0
the interviews of @entity158 presenter @entity128 , top , chatshow host @entity129 , bottom left , and radio 4 today programme presenter @entity130 , bottom right , will also be texts for study ‘ @entity52 and @entity51 , for example , provide a much richer source of oratory than contemporary radio show hosts and tv comedians			0
in a study of spoken @entity7 the only real justification for studying the words of @entity3 or @entity17 is to expose the limitations of their language in comparison with truly great oratory			1
’ an @entity41 spokesman said : ‘ where speakers are selected for the controlled assessment task , schools are given the flexibility to choose speakers or topics which will engage and interest their students			0
‘ speakers are selected because they are public figures whose speeches are widely available and have the breadth to sustain a critical appraisal			0

speeches , sports commentaries and comedy transcripts are just some of the texts students will be studying
it has led to *accusations* that @entity7 exams are being ' dumbed down '
ten per cent of marks come from an analysis of spoken language
@entity62 will be phasing out the ' controlled assignments ' of which this is a part but it will still affect children studying in 2015
students must analyses how orators strike up a rapport with the audience and how they use timing and pace to make an impact
