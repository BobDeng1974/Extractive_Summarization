two in three parents are putting their children 's lives at risk by strapping them in to wrongly fitted car seats			1
and that has soared by more than a third in just five years - putting up to seven out of ten youngsters in danger			0
the figures come just days after the @entity9 revealed the number of children killed or seriously injured on @entity13 's roads has risen for the first time in two decades			2
the number of youngsters killed or seriously injured rose by 3 per cent to 2,060 in the year to september 2014 , official statistics revealed			0
two in three parents are putting their children 's lives at risk by strapping them into seats incorrectly ( file pic ) a study revealed that 71 per cent of seats in @entity24 and @entity25 did not meet minimum fitting standards it also coincides with government measures for a new safer child - seat system - based on a child 's height rather than their age - which is now going through parliament			1
details are revealed in a new report into car - seat safety problems by road safety campaign group @entity38 , which has tested 20,500 child safety seats in @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity41 since 2002			1
it found 71 per cent of seats tested last year in @entity24 and @entity25 and 64 per cent in @entity41 did not meet minimum fitting standards			1
this was a significant increase from 47 per cent in 2010 and the average of 57 per cent the last five years			0
online purchases and second - hand seats have also contributed to the rise in incorrect fitting			1
a which ? survey last year revealed nine out of ten shops – including major high street names – made ' potentially lethal mistakes ' when showing parents how to install their child and baby car seats properly			1
the table shows the checklist a parent should follow when purchasing the right seat for their child @entity64 , chief executive of @entity65 said : ' two thirds of the children and babies in @entity13 are now at risk as a result of the seat being improperly fitted , incorrect for the size and weight of the child , or wrong for the make and model of vehicle			1
' she added : ' the saddest thing is most parents and grandparent genuinely want what is best for their children , they just do n't know how to choose the right seats nor how to fit them			0
' the safety group says parents who buy a child seat in a shop should insist a trained sales assistant helps fit the seat , and parents should specify their child 's height and weight and the car 's model before buying			1
its report says : ' if the seat arrives without clear instructions for fitting and testing , then send it back			0
' if you 're offered a second hand seat , just politely decline			0
there is very little chance that a second hand seat will be right for your car and your child			2
you would n't entrust your child with a stranger yet that 's exactly what you are doing if you place them in a seat without knowing its history '			0
however tempting the price may be , road safety officers advise against buying second hand child car seats – most only have a life span of about five years , and if they have ever been involved in an accident they might not offer full protection			1
even if you want a bargain , you should buy new			0
transport minister @entity126 said : ' we are in the process of signing a new child seat specification			2
' it gives a higher degree of protection and new standards that go on the height of a child , not the age			0
' ministers say that moving to a system based on the child 's height – rather than age - will make it much easier for parents to choose and fit the correct seat			2
legislation currently going through @entity146 will allow a new and safer standard of child seat - known as ' i - size ' – to be used alongside existing ones in @entity13			1
it will require a child to travel in a rearward position until the age of 15 months , provide side impact protection for better protection of the head and neck , and involve a more rigorous testing procedure for new designs , including an improved crash test dummy			0
@entity162 , group manager at the @entity163 ( @entity164 ) in @entity165 said it was developing a new ' star rating ' system which will help consumers make an informed choice when buying a child seat and will include an assessment of the usability of the seat .			2
