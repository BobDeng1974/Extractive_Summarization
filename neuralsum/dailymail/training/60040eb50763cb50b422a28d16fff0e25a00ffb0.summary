@entity0 would not prevent his players from ' making a meal ' out of contact if it meant his @entity6 side were given the decisions they deserved			1
the @entity6 boss was left irked by referee @entity9 during sunday 's 2 - 1 @entity11 defeat to @entity12 at @entity13 after the @entity14 were awarded a penalty and the hosts were denied a late spot - kick			1
@entity18 was adjudged to have felled @entity19 in the box , with @entity9 pointing to the spot as the @entity22 went to ground under the challenge , but - with @entity6 chasing a stoppage - time equaliser - @entity24 decided to stay on his feet when challenged by @entity27			1
@entity12 's @entity19 is tripped by @entity6 defender @entity18 for the penalty incident @entity0 was left annoyed by referee @entity9 after the @entity11 defeat against @entity12 @entity18 of @entity6 and @entity30 react as referee @entity9 awards a penalty to @entity12 at @entity13 @entity19 won and scored the penalty against @entity6 during the 2 - 1 win for @entity12 at @entity13 with both @entity35 and @entity36 profiting from controversial penalty decisions against the @entity6 in recent weeks , @entity0 believes going to ground when caught by the opposition may be the only way to bring a foul to the attention of the officials			1
' as long as it 's not simulation - as long as you get the right decision from it , ' he said when asked if a player needed to fall over to get a foul			2
' if you 're not touched and you go down because you 're not touched , that 's not the way forward			0
but if you ca n't get what you ordinarily should get , then you 've got to consider the fact that if you make a meal of it , you make a meal of it because the contact is sufficient enough			1
' the contact on @entity24 was sufficient enough to put him off getting the ball cleanly in that position to try to help us score a goal			2
it impeded him from getting a better contact on the ball			0
' like i said , that 's where a penalty should be given and if that 's the case then it would be much better across the board			0
' as difficult as it is for referees , those are the decisions that they should be capable of giving			0
all the other infringements are here and there , if you like , but then when it comes to major decisions , it 's how the goal is judged and how the referee is judged			0
' a very good game from a referee ca n't evolve being 99 per cent great and then the one per cent being one major decision he 's got wrong , because then he 's had a bad game - like a goalkeeper can be brilliant and then all of a sudden he drops one ball and it gets put in the net and he 's had it			0
@entity0 believes going to ground when caught may be the only way to bring a foul to the attention of officials @entity99 is suspended and @entity100 ( pictured ) will play no part in @entity6 's game vs @entity103 @entity99 ( left ) is suspended for their match at @entity13 against @entity103 on @entity106 ' unfortunately the referees are not brave enough to give those penalties because , in the surroundings and the atmosphere in the stadiums , it does n't look like one , but their job is to identify if it is or not			1
' @entity6 welcome managerless @entity103 to @entity13 on @entity106 looking to halt a run of two defeats over the festive period , albeit to @entity35 and @entity12 , with @entity0 having an almost - full squad to select from for the visit of the @entity103			1
@entity99 is suspended and @entity100 will play no part as a loan move across @entity122 to @entity124 edges closer			0
fellow summer recruit @entity125 is likely to be involved and the @entity128 striker is hoping to start 2015 with his first goal in front of the @entity6 fans to extend the club 's fine start to the season			1
' i 'm working hard and i want to score a goal at home as soon as possible to thank all the fans for supporting me and making me feel welcome , ' the 25 - year - old told the club 's official website			2
' i 'm doing all i can to make sure @entity6 stay near the top of the @entity11			2
we 've suffered two painful losses recently and we 've dropped down the table slightly			0
' we know the game against @entity103 is a very important one and we 'll do our best to get the three points			0
we want to get 2015 started on the right foot and have a good rest of the season			0
i know that if i perform well i can help @entity6 stay in the upper reaches of the table , so that is my main aim for next year			2
' @entity125 is likely to be involved and is hoping to start 2015 with his first goal in front of @entity6 fans @entity0 would not prevent his players from ' making a meal ' out of contact if it meant they got the decisions			1
