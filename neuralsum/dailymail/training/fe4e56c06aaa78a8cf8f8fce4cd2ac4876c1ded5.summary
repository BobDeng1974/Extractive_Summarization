the friend of @entity2 patient , @entity0 , who visited the man on the day he was admitted to hospital has been told he can return to work as a nursing assistant			1
but the agony of uncertainty is not over for @entity8 , 43 , and his family			1
in a confusing twist his wife , @entity10 35 , mr @entity0 ’s stepdaughter , as ms @entity10 and the couple ’s four children aged between two and 11 have been told they must remain in quarantine with only mr @entity8 free to come and go			1
the family had been left a full 24 hours without information and cut off from all communication due to power cuts brought on by the violent electrical storms that hit the city on thursday			2
he said : ‘ i have been told i can go back to work but they will decide if there are duties i can do and duties i can not			1
‘ they will give me a clearance document and speak to my employer			0
but they will still monitor me every day			0
’ it is a strange halfway house for the family , all of whom have been exposed to mr @entity0 during his most violent phase of symptoms			1
mr @entity8 explained , ‘ @entity48 must stay here with the children because she had more contact than me			1
she was in the ambulance and she helped clean it and she tended to her father			0
’ ms @entity10 , also a nursing assistant , sat on a fold up chair outside the front door of the apartment that has been the family ’s holding cell since mr @entity0 ’s diagnosis last week			1
she expressed relief for her husband ’s situation and explained the conflicting news delivered by the @entity24 officials who had left just moments before @entity20 arrived			1
she said : ‘ they have said he can go out			0
i can sit here and the children can come outside this far but that we can not go downstairs or any further than this			0
’ she gestured , drawing an imaginary boundary on the exterior stairwell , two chairs ’ breadth from the apartment ’s front door			0
the children , aged two , four , six and 11 , smiled broadly , clearly delighted with even this small freedom			2
danger : @entity0 ( left ) is still being treated for @entity82 in @entity83 , and @entity10 must remain in isolation at home because she touched @entity0 - her stepfather - to - be - when she gave him tea in hospital sanitizing : a hazmat team finally arrived to @entity0 's flat yesterday to sanitize the premises earlier ms @entity10 had appeared sticky eyed and congested but as dusk crept in she looked simply weary and glad for the fresh air now afforded her and her children			1
@entity82 is only contagious when the infected person is exhibiting symptoms			0
but it can then be transmitted by an exchange of body fluids including blood , saliva , semen and feces if contact is at a point of entry like a cut or graze , mouth , nose or eyes			0
the entire family has had exposure during the time when mr @entity0 was exhibiting increasingly violent symptoms			2
both mr @entity8 and ms @entity10 visited the sick man on the day he was taken into hospital and the children all spent the night in the apartment where their grandmother often cared for them while their parents – both nursing assistants – worked			1
they are among the ten considered high risk by health officials yet the extent to which they have been left adrift in the midst of this crisis is breathtaking			0
yesterday ms @entity132 ’s mother , @entity131 , along with the other quarantined occupants of the @entity130 unit in which mr @entity0 briefly stayed , was finally moved to another location as @entity135 suited teams moved in to begin the two phases of cleaning and securing the contaminated apartment			1
in a brief telephone conversation with @entity20 shortly before the family were moved ms @entity131 insisted , ‘ i am fine			1
thank @entity141 we are all fine			0
’ she would not comment on her worries for the man who had travelled to this country from @entity145 to marry her and who now lies in a hospital bed , too weak to pray or communicate with family			2
ms @entity10 last saw her mother when she visited the now empty @entity150 last sunday			2
she told the @entity151 that she found him in bed , fully dressed and shivering			0
after going to buy him a blanket she brought the man she calls @entity157 some hot tea when she noticed redness in his eyes , a well publicized sign of @entity82			2
evacuated : there are ten people who are considered high - risk , and were moved to an isolated apartment moving : here an official can be seen leading a young man from the block in @entity22 , @entity83 , to transportation with his temperature at @entity172 , ms @entity10 who , like her husband mr @entity8 is a nursing assistant , called 911			1
when the ambulance arrived ms @entity10 brought the blanket in which she had wrapped her stepfather to the hospital			1
earlier this week mr @entity8 told @entity20 his own brief conversation with his friend that day			1
he said , ‘ the last time i saw @entity0 was sunday , the day he went to hospital			2
i had seen him after he went to hospital the first time and he was looking fine , he had been just fine			2
‘ but that day i passed by on sunday he was lying down on the bed in the room and i asked him how he was			0
he said , “ i ’m not okay			0
” ‘ he said he had been having diarrhea all night			0
’ mr @entity0 was diagnosed on tuesday , and mr @entity8 said that he was told the news the very day he was supposed to go back to work at the @entity189 home			1
last night , though visibly relieved at the news he had received from @entity24 and @entity25 officials mr @entity8 said that he did not intend to return to work for several days at least			1
he said , ‘ i am glad but right now i want to be here for my family			0
i need to look after them			0
money is not easy but sometimes things are more important than money			0
‘ family is more important			0
