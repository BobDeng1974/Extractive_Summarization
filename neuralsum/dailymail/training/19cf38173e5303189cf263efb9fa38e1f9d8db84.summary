@entity0 has teamed up with @entity1 to offer one lucky reader the chance to win a signed @entity6 @entity5 shirt and a photo of the @entity9 star @entity6 ’s multi-million pound return to @entity11 at the end of this season is a scenario that potentially suits everyone : @entity5 get a large part of their £ 80million outlay on the player they bought in 2009 back ; @entity6 gets to be the returning hero ; and the @entity21 get to put right one of their biggest regrets as @entity25 owners – letting their prize asset leave the club			1
what none of the parties involved will do just now , is admit it ’s a possibility			0
@entity5 have lost two of their opening three games of the season and the president , @entity34 , is under pressure – the last message he needs to be sending out is that at the end of the campaign he will sell a player who after just five seasons already has club legend @entity42 all - time top goalscorer record in his sights			1
@entity6 likewise will not want to be seen to be the bad guy agitating for a move			1
he is happy in the @entity47 capital playing for a manager he likes and with a group of players whose company he enjoys			2
@entity54 was a friend but best pal @entity55 is still at the club and @entity57 is also now part of the former @entity25 man ’s inner circle			1
@entity6 shows off his skills as @entity5 train while @entity63 ( left ) and @entity64 watch on @entity6 is reportedly unhappy with life at @entity5 and is considering quitting the club @entity57 ( second right ) and @entity55 ( right ) watch on as @entity6 shows off his footwork @entity6 and his @entity5 team - mates are preparing to face @entity70 in the @entity71 @entity6 is reported to be unhappy with @entity5 's decision to sell @entity54 to @entity25 @entity5 ( 2009 - ) appearances : 251 goals : 256 major honours : 1 @entity76 , 1 @entity71 , 1 @entity77 , 2 @entity78 @entity25 ( 2003 - 2009 ) appearances : 292 goals : 118 major honours : 3 @entity82 titles , 1 @entity71 , 1 @entity83 , 1 @entity84 , 2 @entity85 but still , in spite of that contentment in @entity47 , there is a doubt			1
@entity5 remain an instable club – perhaps the only club in the world that would respond to winning the @entity71 by selling two of its best players			1
the summer transfer activity did not entirely please @entity6 and he made sure people knew it			1
' if i was in charge i would have done things differently , ’ he said			0
that was a slap around the face for a president who just a year earlier had made @entity6 the highest paid player in the club ’s history			1
@entity34 said publicly several days later that he in no way saw it as a show of dissent but there was really no other way to see it and the quote will come back to haunt both men if the season does not go well for @entity5			2
doing his best to pour a little gasoline over the smoldering flames was former @entity5 president @entity118 on monday , when he said he believed a @entity6 return to @entity11 was possible			1
@entity6 enjoyed a glittering six - year spell with @entity25 and could return to @entity11 @entity6 is still considered a hero at @entity25 - five years after he left the club @entity6 won the @entity71 with @entity25 on a rainy night in @entity123 in 2008 ‘ my impression is he is fed up with the policy of the current president , ’ said @entity118 of his sworn enemy @entity34			1
‘ when he came to @entity5 with [ @entity130 ] @entity129 he thought he would be a good colleague for him in the team but then he was sold			2
‘ [ @entity133 ] @entity132 was sold and he did n’t like that			0
last year he thought it was a mistake to let [ @entity137 ] @entity136 leave and the last straw was selling @entity139 and @entity54 this summer , ’ he went on			2
some of @entity118 ’s comments are fanciful			0
@entity6 was not disappointed that @entity129 was sold in 2009 , he was too busy being delighted about taking his place in the team			2
and any disappointment at @entity136 leaving last year soon evaporated as @entity57 came in and helped @entity6 win another @entity71			2
neither was he particularly close to @entity139 to be too fussed by his departure but after his years spent in the secure bosom of @entity11 where sir @entity147 built and rebuilt his squad with care , he has been somewhat dismayed by the ripping apart of last season ’s @entity151 champions			0
@entity6 could link up with old friend @entity153 once more if he returned to @entity25 @entity6 felt @entity5 should have signed @entity154 , who also signed on loan for @entity25 @entity6 would be reunited with old friend and team - mate @entity157 if returned to @entity25 he also shares an agent – @entity159 – with @entity154 , who he feels should have been signed in the summer , and @entity153 who he would have liked to have seen stay			1
he would be reunited with both at @entity11 if he returns , providing @entity154 is kept on beyond his initial season - long loan deal			1
that might be another card that @entity25 can play at the end of this season			0
they might also remind @entity6 that @entity25 fans have never stopped singing his name			1
at @entity5 he is now the adored talisman he feels he always should have been but he has had to fight hard for the adulation and the jeers and whistles for @entity172 at the weekend will have reminded him that this club does not always appreciate its legends			1
the @entity5 keeper has been at the club for 15 years but that has not stopped the boo - boys demanding he be dropped			1
there would be hero worship at @entity11 , a reunion with @entity153 and with @entity157 and if @entity34 can get his money back on @entity6 and swoop for several stars – it will take a least two huge new signings to appease the fans if @entity6 is sold – then maybe , just maybe it can happen			1
for now , however , everyone at @entity5 will go on pretending it is out of the question			0
too much is at stake for them to say anything else			0
everyone knows that — i have said it many times			0
@entity193 is in my heart			0
i left many good friends there , the supporters are amazing and i wish i can come back one day			0
i am happy here in @entity5 and have four more years , but in the future you never know because they treated me unbelievably there			2
@entity6 opens up in an interview with the @entity205 ( 2014 ) i loved it there , i was 18 years old , i win everything there , the people treat me like a god there so i appreciate and the future nobody know			2
it ’s crazy that they still sing my name			0
i ’ll not forget it so i appreciate it a lot			0
i love @entity193 , to be back , i never know , you never know , football you never know			0
of course i ’m happy at @entity5			0
it ’s my home , it ’s my club but @entity193 treat me unbelievable so we never know			0
ronaldo in an interview with @entity226 ( 2014 ) i did think about @entity25			2
they are still in my heart			0
it is a club where i played for six years and i love that club			0
i have a lot of friends there and i wish them all the best @entity6 , speaking after winning 2013 @entity233 , says he considered @entity25 return that summer			1

doubts remain over the long - term future of @entity6 at @entity5
@entity9 star ronaldo has been linked with a move back to @entity11
the 29 - year - old was reportedly unhappy with the club 's summer transfers
@entity6 is content in @entity47 but knows life at @entity5 remains *unpredictable*
@entity6 also knows @entity5 's boo - boys could one day turn on him
fans have already turned on *goalkeeper* @entity172
@entity25 fans still worship @entity6
