the @entity1 economy took a dramatic tumble last fall as retail sales declined and and foreign imports increased			0
the @entity5 revealed on friday that the gross domestic product ( gdp ) - one of the primary indicators used to gauge the health of a country 's economy - shrank by more than half in the 2014 fourth quarter to just 2.2 per cent			1
it marked a major slowdown from the third quarter 's robust 5.0 percent pace , which had been the strongest growth in 11 years			1
economists , however , remain optimistic that the deceleration was temporary			1
the @entity5 said gross domestic product grew 2.2 percent between october to december last year - it marked a major slowdown from the third quarter 's robust 5.0 percent pace ( seen above , right ) many forecast that growth will rise above 3 per cent in 2015 , which would give the country the strongest economic growth in a decade			1
they say the job market has healed enough to generate strong consumer spending going forward			0
the economy is ' doing just fine , ' said @entity29 , chief @entity1 economist at @entity30 , who noted that although gdp growth slowed in the fourth quarter , the @entity1 added an average of 284,000 new jobs from october through december			1
for all of 2014 , the economy expanded 2.4 percent , up slightly from 2.2 percent growth in 2013			1
consumer spending , which accounts for 70 per cent of economic activity , was a bright spot in the fourth quarter			2
it expanded at an annual rate of 4.2 per cent , down slightly from the first estimate of 4.3 percent growth but still the best showing since the first quarter of 2006			1
friday 's report was the second of three estimates for fourth quarter gdp , the broadest measure of the economy 's total output of goods and services			1
economists , however , remain optimistic that the deceleration was temporary @entity57 , senior economist at @entity58 , said that ' while the economy ended the year with less momentum than in the summer and fall , average annual growth of 2.9 percent in the past six quarters still denotes a meaningful upward shift from 2.1 percent in the first four years of the recovery			1
' the downward revision stemmed largely from slower stockpiling by businesses			0
last month , the rise in inventories was estimated to have added 0.8 percentage points to fourth quarter growth			1
but that was lowered to a contribution of just 0.1 percentage point in the new estimate			0
the change , however , will likely translate into stronger growth in the current quarter because businesses will not have to work down an overhang of unsold goods			2
@entity83 also weighed more heavily on growth than first thought , subtracting 1.2 percentage points as imports grew much more strongly than first thought			2
that could be a reflection of the rising value of the dollar , which makes imported products cheaper for @entity1 consumers			0
many analysts believe 2015 will start slowly , in part reflecting the disruptions caused by a rough winter			0
however , it 's unlikely to be as bad as the first quarter of 2014 , when heavy snow and cold contributed to a 2.1 percent plunge in growth in the first quarter of 2014			1
that big drop was followed by sizzling growth rates of 4.6 percent in the second quarter and 5 percent in the third quarter			2
analysts are looking for less of a roller - coaster ride this year			0
@entity112 economists say growth will come in around 2.5 percent in the current quarter and then hover between 2.5 percent to 3 percent for the rest of the year			1
they are forecasting growth of 3.1 percent for the entire year , a significant improvement from the 2.4 percent growth seen in 2014			2
if the forecast proves accurate , it would be the best gdp performance since the economy grew by 3.3 percent in 2005 , two years before the beginning of worst economic downturn the country has experienced since the 1930s			2
the @entity1 economy took a dramatic tumble last fall as retail sales declined and and foreign imports increased @entity130 , chief economist at @entity131 , is even more optimistic			2
he 's forecasting economic growth of 3.5 percent this year			1
@entity130 and other economists believe the key to the economy shifting into a higher gear will be further improvements in the labor market , when stronger job gains leading to rising wage gains			0
' i see 2015 as a really good year for consumer spending because of the wage gains , ' @entity130 said			0
even though the recession ended nearly six years ago , wage growth has been weak as businesses were able to pay less with so many unemployed looking for jobs			2
several large companies have already signaled a willingness to pay more to retain workers			0
retailers like @entity151 and @entity152 , as well as the health insurer @entity153			0
news last week that @entity156 , the nation 's largest private employer , would also increase its minimum pay could be a sign that a tighter labor market are finally leading to increased wages , some analysts believe			0
the unemployment has fallen to 5.7 percent			0
@entity164 chair @entity163 , testifying to @entity165 this week , listed stronger wage growth as one of the elements the central bank is looking for before deciding to start raising interest rates			0
she said as long as wage gains remained weak and inflation low , the @entity164 was prepared to remain ' patient ' in moving to raise rates			0
many private economists believe the @entity164 's first move to increase its key rate , which has been near a record low of zero for six years , will not come until june at the earliest .			1

the @entity5 said friday that gross domestic product grew 2.2 percent between october to december last year
it was weaker than its previous *2.6* per cent estimate
it marked a major slowdown from the third quarter 's robust 5.0 percent pace , which had been the strongest growth in 11 years
economists , however , remain optimistic the deceleration was temporary
the trend *apparently* reflectd a smaller rise in inventories and a larger increase in imports
