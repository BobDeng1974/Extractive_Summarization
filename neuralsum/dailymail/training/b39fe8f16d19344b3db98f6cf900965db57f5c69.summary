by @entity0 @entity1 has given himself a great chance of making it two wins in a row heading into the @entity6 at @entity7 this week			0
the popular @entity8 posted a wonderful 66 to be tied for the lead with home hope @entity10 going into the final round of the @entity13			1
@entity14 arrived at @entity15 full of confidence following a gutsy victory in his last outing in @entity21 ’s capital at the @entity23 event , where he prevailed on the first hole of a sudden - death play - off			1
on top : @entity1 celebrates his birdie on the 16th hole during the third round on saturday on the tee : @entity14 hits off the 17th tee as the @entity8 takes a share of the lead into the final day that has shown over the first three rounds as the 33 - year - old closes in on another success			1
the only worry for @entity14 if he wins , of course , would be whether it meant he has peaked too early when it comes to the @entity44 , for how many players win three events in a row ? against that , @entity14 is such a classy and tough competitor these days he might be one of the few who could handle the expectation			2
he showed just how good he has become over the supposedly more difficult back nine , as he mustered no fewer than five birdies to make his statement of intent			0
‘ that was as good as i have played all year , ’ enthused @entity14			2
‘ i am on a nice little run right now and so the goal now is to keep it going and pull off my first pro win in @entity60			0
’ @entity10 however , has every incentive to win himself on what promises to be an intriguing final day as he seeks an afternoon of redemption and make up for the worst day of his professional life in this event two years ago			0
back then , @entity10 led by three shots with just five holes to go , only to lose to @entity68 from @entity69			0
‘ at the end of the day i ca n’t change what happened but i can dream about making amends and winning it this year , ’ said the @entity70			0
@entity14 and @entity10 will begin one shot ahead of little - known @entity77 @entity76 , who does have four @entity78 wins to his name			2
@entity80 recovered from his latest friday horror show to shoot 68 and stand seven shots back , with defending champion @entity83 a further shot adrift			1
spot of bother : @entity60 's @entity10 plays out of the thick rough on the 12th hole popular : @entity80 tees off on the 4th hole at @entity15 as a large crowd watches on @entity83 : @entity83 appears in good spirits as he walks onto the 18th tee at the @entity13			1

@entity14 posted a third - round 66 to tie for the lead with @entity94 at @entity15
the @entity96 won the @entity23 in @entity21 last month
@entity80 is seven shots back , with @entity83 a further shot adrift
