a rocket scientist has urged @entity1 to ' stay out of the space business ' and ' go sell mobile phones ' in the wake of a fatal explosion aboard one of its spacecraft			1
@entity8 , a rocket propulsion scientist at the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , said @entity12 's private space line should ' give up ' following the test flight crash in which a pilot was killed			1
@entity15 , 39 , died at the controls of @entity1 's experimental @entity18 vessel on friday after the sub-orbital plane exploded at 45,000ft shortly after engaging its engines			1
his co-pilot , @entity21 , who was seriously injured , is now ' alert and talking ' , according to the company			0
experts have said they warned the company repeatedly over its safety procedures disaster : moments after @entity18 detached from its mothership ( left ) and engaged its engines ( center ) , it blew apart in the skies ( right )			1
the precise causes of the crash have yet to be established co-operation : @entity12 said @entity1 were complying with an independent investigation into the crash mrs @entity8 said : ' they should stop , give up			1
go away and do something they might be good at like selling mobile phones - they should stay out of the space business			0
' she claimed she had contacted those involved in the project in around 2009 or 2010 to raise her concerns about the use of nitrous oxide , which she said can ' go bang in a very unpredictable way '			0
but she stressed it was not yet clear what caused the latest incident , adding : ' there ’s any number of things that could have brought it down			0
' mrs @entity8 , co-partner of @entity75 , an engineering project , is one of a number of space flight experts who have accused @entity1 of ignoring warnings over its safety procedures in the wake of a fatal explosion aboard one of its spacecraft			1
senior engineers and propulsion scientists say they spent years telling @entity12 's private space line its procedures are ' outdated ' , needlessly secretive , and could lead to people getting killed			1
and , in a further sign of upheaval at @entity1 , it was also revealed yesterday that top engineers in charge of safety , aerodynamics and the propulsion system have all recently quit the company			1
many of the warnings stem from a 2007 disaster where an engine part exploded at a test facility in the @entity38 , killing three employees of @entity1 's partner company , @entity107			1
some have accused @entity12 's project of ignoring industry standards and refusing to share its procedures in its eagerness to perfect commercial space flight , which it has regularly estimated is just months from completion			1
one expert called the design and testing process a ' russian roulette ' which was bound to kill someone			0
victim : @entity15 , pictured , died in the crash yesterday @entity8 , a rocket propulsion scientist at the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , told the @entity124 she had been warning @entity1 for seven years about its safety record			1
she said : ' this explosion is not a surprise			0
none whatsoever , i am sorry to say			0
it is exactly what i was expecting			0
it was @entity134 roulette which test flight blew up			0
' the executive director of the @entity10 also said that @entity1 refused to let scientists from outside the company review its procedures , and snubbed industry gatherings			1
@entity141 , a former head of safety for the @entity143 , said : ' they operated in secrecy , which is difficult to understand			2
' they do n’t use modern techniques in putting safety into the design ... i have been saying for some years now this was an accident waiting to happen			2
' @entity153 , a concerned rocket scientist , also revealed that he wrote to the @entity155 urging them to do something about his safety concerns over @entity18			2
writing in july 2013 , he said even the company 's own engineers privately doubted that their venture was safe			2
at the time @entity1 had said they were just five months away from taking their first passengers , including children , into space			1
he said : ' sir @entity12 , his two children , @entity169 and one other will be the first passengers to fly into space during this coming december 2013 , and everyone realises there is a problem , even the engineers ... have said so off the record			1
' the disaster came in the wake of three top engineers at @entity1 quitting since late 2013			2
@entity180 , formerly the vice-president of safety , reportedly left just before @entity182			2
the @entity184 blog reported that @entity1 spent months unsuccessfully advertising for a successor to the job			2
the outlet also reported that @entity188 , the vice-president of propulsion , left @entity1 in january 2014 to work on a company sending unmanned satellites into space instead			1
senior figures were walking out of the development facility as recently as last month , according to a biographer of @entity196 who said the ' crude ' @entity18 's destruction was ' inevitable '			1
speaking to the @entity201 's @entity200 yesterday , @entity199 said : ' all the engineers in @entity203 working on the project i 've spoken to said it was very dangerous , just a few weeks ago the last of many of the @entity1 engineers walked out of the factory and said he 'd never work there again			1
' he added : ' the most important issue was in 2007 - three engineers were killed in an explosion when a rocket exploded on the ground rocket explosion on the ground			2
' ever since then it has become apparent that the science used to create this rocket is completely unreliable			0
' the explosion seven years ago , which killed @entity107 employees @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 , has been the focus of many criticisms			2
some say it ought to have been a wake - up call for the company			0
the fatal accident took place at a ground facility while testing an engine filled with nitrous oxide , a liquid fuel which is part of @entity18 's hybrid rocket engine			2
explosion : one expert called the design and testing process a ' russian roulette ' which was bound to kill someone ' dangerous ' : flight safety experts claim they repeatedly voiced their concerns over the private space line debris : a small part of the doomed spacecraft lies in the @entity203 desert			1
experts have said they were not surprised by the crash wreckage : officers keep watch over what remains of @entity18 , which crashed into the @entity203 desert on friday findings : investigators take photographs of the wreckage of @entity18 , which crashed into the @entity203 desert investigations failed to discover why the tank blew up - especially as the test was not meant to ignite the fuel			2
a study published by the @entity10 said : ' we are not confident that … we yet know enough about @entity268 [ nitrous oxide ] to consider it a safe oxidiser for use in passenger flight			0
in the light of what we do know , safety must remain a major concern			0
' @entity153 , the rocket scientists , also referenced the fatal event , and wrote to the @entity280 urging them to review @entity1 's premit to operate space flights			1
he said : ' we respectfully request a response from you on what actions the @entity280 will be taking with respect to the permit issued and the operations as planned in the @entity38 and @entity292 facilities			0
' remember three people have been killed and numerous persons injured by a prior explosion involving @entity268 in this motor design			0
we do not need another incident on the ground / flight line or in the air			0
' fatal : test pilot @entity15 died on friday morning after the spacecraft exploded at 45,000ft standing firm : virgin founder @entity12 denied his company had ignored any warnings , and insisted that nothing can be known until the official investigation is finished speaking today at his @entity306 , @entity1 founder @entity12 denied that the company had ignored warnings			1
he said : ' to be honest i find it slightly irresponsible that people who know nothing about what they are saying can be saying things before the @entity34 [ one body investigating the crash ] makes their comments			0
' we are n’t going to push on blindly			0
to do so would be an insult to all those affected by this tragedy			0
we are going to learn from what went wrong , discover how we can improve safety and performance and then move forwards together			0
' we owe it to our test pilots to find out exactly what went wrong and once we find out what went wrong , if we can overcome it , we ’ll make absolutely certain that the dream lives on			0

rocket scientists and space flight experts say they have worried for years over the safety of @entity1
head of an international space safety group said explosion was inevitable after group snubbed industry findings
@entity1 reportedly ignored *invitations* to industry events and was ' secretive ' about their procedures
senior staff in charge of the private space line 's safety , aerodynamics and propulsion quit in 2014
@entity12 denied that any warnings had been *missed* and said company was *cooperating* with investigation
