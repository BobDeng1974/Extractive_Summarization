he has been a colossus of the game			0
he has made 700 professional club appearances and won 81 caps for @entity5 , six @entity7 titles , the @entity8 and the @entity9			2
in his pomp , he was the stuff of strikers ' nightmares , driving some of the world 's greatest goalscorers to distraction with lightning - sharp reactions and an instinctive reading of the game			0
that 's why it 's such a shame that what is likely to be @entity21 's farewell year in the @entity23 game has fizzled out			1
@entity21 pictured in training at @entity25 last week			1
the 36 - year - old defender started regularly in the first part of the season but has been unable to hold down his spot in the side @entity21 started the first seven matches of @entity25 's @entity7 campaign before being dropped @entity21 has enjoyed a fantastic career , winning six @entity7 titles , but a fairytale finish is unlikely @entity21 and @entity36 lift the @entity9 for @entity37 in @entity38 back in 2008 @entity21 also won 81 caps for @entity5 during his glittering career he would love to be out there , hunting down and hassling opponents , robbing attackers of the ball , winning the aerial duels , playing his part in @entity25 ' survival mission			1
keeping them up would be a fitting curtain call			0
instead , @entity21 's season has been one spent on the margins - either suspended , benched or out of the squad altogether			2
once again , the 36 - year - old was forced to watch on from the sidelines as @entity25 claimed a potentially crucial point away to @entity57 on tuesday night			1
@entity21 had picked up a slight knock and was ruled out			2
he has played just five times since the start of october - not much of a swansong			2
on sunday , he posted a @entity63 picture of a pile of chicken bones after lunch at his mum 's			0
he had not been involved in the 4 - 1 win at @entity69 24 hours earlier and it weirdly seemed to sum up his peripheral role at the moment			0
by contrast , @entity21 had started @entity25 's first seven games of the campaign , lasting the full 90 minutes in all of them			1
@entity77 had grand plans and the best of intentions last summer			0
having called time on his @entity37 career after 12 trophy - laden seasons , @entity21 moved to @entity84 in what @entity77 described as a ' remarkable coup for the club			1
' @entity77 described @entity21 's signing last summer as a ' remarkable coup ' for the club but after initial promise , @entity21 has largely spent the season on the bench @entity7 ( 6 ) : 2002 - 03 , 2006 - 07 , 2007 - 08 , 2008 - 09 , 2010 - 11 , 2012 - 13 @entity8 ( 1 ) : 2003 - 04 @entity94 ( 2 ) : 2005 - 06 , 2008 - 09 @entity95 ( 5 ) : 2003 , 2007 , 2008 , 2011 , 2013 @entity9 ( 1 ) : 2007 - 08 @entity96 ( 1 ) : 2008 even in his mid-thirties , @entity77 believed @entity21 would bring ' quality , class , experience and know - how ' as @entity25 returned to the top flight			1
he envisaged @entity102 in a sweeper role , the central pivot of a three - man defence in an in - vogue 3 - 5 - 2 system			1
he would bring all that experience to bear , helping @entity108 and @entity109 keep opposition attacks at bay			0
unfortunately , it just did n't work			0
in their first seven @entity7 games of the season , @entity25 won one , drew one and lost five			2
they leaked 15 goals and the scale of their task in staying in the top division was clear			0
@entity21 was demoted to the bench , @entity120 and @entity121 were introduced and the dye was cast for the season			0
his suspension for using the word ' sket ' in a tweet did n't help and by the time that was served , @entity21 was down the pecking order			0
@entity21 has shown glimpses of his imperious best for @entity25 this season but @entity21 's farewell season in @entity23 football has not lived up to his expectations @entity135 has played @entity21 on three occasions since taking over from @entity77 @entity25 find themselves two points from safety after their 3 - 3 draw at @entity57 on tuesday as you would expect , @entity21 has conducted himself like a model professional on the training ground , maintaining his fitness in case he was called upon			1
and there have been such occasions , notably the 2 - 0 win at @entity148 in february - @entity135 's second game in charge after replacing @entity77 , that ended @entity25 's 11 - game losing run on the road			1
@entity21 may yet be called upon again in the run - in , with @entity25 sitting two points shy of safety , but the season so far will have fallen short of his hopes and expectations			1
that fairytale finale , with @entity21 leading an heroic resistance to keep @entity25 in the @entity7 , seems unlikely			1
there are rumours that clubs in the money - soaked @entity164 are preparing to tempt @entity21 with one final payday but that remains to be seen			2
for now , @entity169 's farewell has sadly fallen a bit flat			0
the fixtures remaining for the bottom six in the @entity7			0

@entity21 missed 3 - 3 *thriller* with @entity57 through *injury*
he has featured in just five @entity25 matches since the start of october
@entity77 initially wanted him to be at centre of a back three
but the plan *backfired* as @entity25 made a poor start in @entity7
@entity21 has found it *difficult* to regain his place in farewell year
