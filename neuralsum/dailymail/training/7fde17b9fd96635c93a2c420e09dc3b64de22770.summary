he was less than impressed when he heard that @entity1 and @entity2 were planning to assassinate him in spoof @entity4 movie @entity3 , but it seems there are some films that @entity10 's @entity9 does approve of			1
but with titles like @entity12 comes to get married , a @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , sitting through them might prove a challenge			2
despite the uninspiring titles , @entity10 boasts a thriving film industry , with the biggest film studio , which has sets that include a @entity22 and an @entity24 country village , just outside @entity25			1
' so was their dear leader @entity59 , who described it as " the most powerful medium for educating the masses "			0
in fact , he liked it so much , he even kidnapped @entity37 director @entity65 and his wife in 1978 and held them until 1986			0
' despite the @entity69 escape , @entity10 continues to make films , although most double as propaganda with tales of perfidious @entity38 and heroic @entity10 dominating the script			0
apart from within universities where films like @entity79 and @entity80 are shown to language students , @entity76 films are not allowed , although that did n't stop @entity9 from taking exception to @entity3			1
indeed , so offended was @entity9 by his cinematic death , he declared it ' an act of war ' while hackers allegedly funded by @entity10 tapped into computers belonging to backers @entity91 and stole thousands of documents - including some extremely embarrassing emails			1
one saw producer @entity94 describe @entity95 as ' a minimally talented spoilt brat ' , while another exchange saw @entity94 claim to have no idea who actor @entity100 was before going on to crack jokes about the star 's manhood			0
favourites : popular titles include urban girl comes to get married and a @entity13 welcome : those visiting the @entity109 are greeted by this rousing fresco disciplined : film shoots are run along military lines with everyone expected to know what to do and say at all times backstage : extras leave their clothes and shoes in a single large changing room , staffed by a pair of dressers on guard : a soldier left to guard the piles of clothes opts for having a sleep on them instead looking good : a pair of extras in traditional dress have their hair attended to by two of the studio 's legion hair and make - up artists starring role : an elderly actor has his beard carefully neatened by a hairdresser - ironically sporting a cap emblazoned with the @entity144 logo tidying up : the hair and make - up artist completes the job , slicking down the actor 's beard with a little oil such theatrics would never happen in @entity10 , says @entity47 , where all actors are state - sponsored and tourists frequently find themselves becoming accidental guest stars			1
' the actors have to reread their scripts just before shooting starts , ' says @entity47 of his day on set with @entity10 's acting a-list			1
' there 's a real military atmosphere and discipline is very strict			0
' @entity10 's love of film began with @entity59 who , according to the regime , once shot a film personally - about the founding member of the dynasty , @entity168 - and earned himself the title of ' @entity171 ' in the process			1
he also managed more than 600 visits to the @entity57 during his tenure and was instrumental in ensuring a film about the 2009 release of two @entity178 tourists held prisoner by the regime was made			0
the story of the release , which came during the visit of former president @entity183 , was given a @entity10 twist and turned into an epic about the strength and power of a dynasty that could ' force ' @entity178 leaders to do its bidding			2
getting ready : extras sit down en masse on a tarmac road cutting through one of the sets as the director explains their role and action ! the extras , who are playing the role of demonstrators , get to work as the camera ( right ) starts rolling protest : according to @entity47 , this staged protest - set in @entity207 - was the only one that he saw during his visit to the country @entity212 : a group of young extras have their hats adjusted - overseen by a group of soldiers perfect : a regime official signs off an actress ' hairdo as filming at the @entity221 gets underway all smiles : a group of extras , dressed in @entity226 style garb and sitting in the @entity228 set , smile for the camera superstars : these photos are of @entity10 's most talented stars but unlike @entity4 's talent , they are paid by the government so important are these films to the @entity10 regime , according to @entity47 , visits to the cinema are completely free			1
' people do n't usually have to pay an entrance fee , ' he confirms			0
' it is seen by people as an opportunity to relax and have fun			0
' sometimes there is a real fight to enter the movie theatre as so many people who want to go at the same time			0
my guide told me that he sometimes had to stand up to see the film as all the seats are full			0
' those who ca n't make it into the cinema can not avoid the propaganda that accompanies the films , however			0
according to @entity47 , @entity25 and other cities are peppered with film posters , many of which are painted onto the walls and all of which push regime messages			2
' most of the time , the posters show @entity10 heroes who suffered for their nation , not people smiling , ' says @entity47			2
' they look more like the usual propaganda posters than movie ads. ' and while @entity1 and @entity2 remain unlikely to ever find themselves adorning a @entity10 wall , one much - loved @entity76 figure can be spotted everywhere			2
' @entity275 is really popular , ' says @entity47			1
' they even use old @entity275 movies to teach video editing techniques			0
most of the @entity10 think @entity275 is @entity280 though			1
' heroine : films such as @entity15 and @entity283 focus on the heroics of @entity10 's soldiers permanent : in @entity25 and other cities , the posters are painted onto walls and remain in place for years new releases : film posters show some of the new movies available to watch , many of which offer a @entity10 take on current events power : others , such as this one about the country 's rocket programme , emphasise the power of @entity10 unsmiling : according to @entity47 , it is rare to see a smiling actor on a film poster because most films are preoccupied with martyrdom loved : old @entity275 films are used to teach video editing techniques , although most of the students believe @entity275 is @entity280 looks familiar ? this part of the @entity109 is supposed to stand in for @entity228 home from home : the @entity315 countryside is also represented , in the shape of a series of picturesque period cottages free : because of its use as propaganda , going to the cinema is completely free in @entity10 knock - offs : despite @entity76 films ostensibly being banned , some @entity280 copies - as well as local films - are available as copied dvds			1

@entity329 was hacked by @entity10 after making film that features the assassination of @entity9
hackers have released embarrassing emails from the studio and forced @entity3 's release to be cancelled
but @entity10 has its own movie industry , and its leader enjoys such titles as a @entity13
photographer @entity47 went behind the scenes in the country and *revealed* its deep love of cinema
@entity275 is also popular with @entity10 but only because they think @entity275 is @entity280
