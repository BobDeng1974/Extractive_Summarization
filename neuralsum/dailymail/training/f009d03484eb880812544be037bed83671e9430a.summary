by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:44 am on 29th june 2011 major film studios battling online piracy launched a test case action at the @entity5 yesterday against @entity7 's biggest internet service provider			2
they are urging a judge in @entity10 to grant an order which would force @entity12 to cut off customers ' access to a website accused of ' flagrant ' copyright infringement			0
@entity18 studios - including @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 - have brought the proceedings over the @entity24 website , which has around 700,000 members			1
' social evil ' : major film studios battling online piracy have launched a test case action at the @entity5 against @entity12 , @entity7 's biggest internet service provider @entity30 , arguing for an injunction on behalf of the applicants , told mr @entity33 at the start of an estimated three - day hearing that the @entity24 copyright infringement was being carried out on a ' grand scale '			1
the general economic impact of piracy on the film and tv industry was , he said , ' nothing short of staggering '			1
describing the illegal activity as a ' social evil ' , mr @entity43 said the loss to the industry was estimated to be ' several hundred millions of pounds '			1
a report published last year estimated overall loss to the film industry to be £ 477million in 2009 and £ 58million to the tv industry			1
the @entity5 action , which is being brought on behalf of all members of the @entity54 , is believed to be the first in @entity7 where an attempt is being made to force an internet provider to block a site under the @entity59 ( @entity59 )			0
filmmakers want @entity12 to block @entity24 with the same system that stops access to sites hosting child sex abuse images			2
mr @entity43 said the order sought was a simple one for @entity12 to implement and ' costs nothing '			0
the @entity67 told the judge : ' the applicants and others have been making huge efforts , not only against the @entity24 website , but against piracy in general and yet the industries are still suffering huge losses to piracy			1
' if the order is not made , websites such as @entity24 will simply be able to move offshore , anonymise the individuals behind the website and cock a snook at the courts and at rights holders who put their trust in the courts			1
' studios - including @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 - have brought the proceedings over the @entity24 website , which has 700,000 members @entity12 is contesting the claim for an injunction , arguing that there is no jurisdiction for the court to make the order sought against it under the @entity59			1
mr @entity43 said the background to the dispute was a successful @entity5 action last year against @entity24			2
as a result of orders made by a judge in those proceedings the @entity24 website was taken offline and the company that operated it was put into liquidation ' avoiding the payment of the costs order and any damages '			1
but the website was only offline for a ' very short while ' and was now back up and running and continued to focus on providing movies and tv			2
the @entity67 told the judge that apart from the addition of the digit ' 2 ' to the name to make it @entity24 ' the only difference appears to be that the operation has been moved offshore '			2
the upshot was that , despite ' considerable effort and expense ' in bringing a successful action against the website operators , those behind it ' continue flagrantly to infringe the applicants ' copyrights '			0
the ' very large ' number of subscribers to the @entity24 website ' continue to infringe the applicants ' copyrights by downloading copies of many commercially important motion pictures and television programmes '			1
mr @entity43 told the judge : ' the applicants have no realistic means of bringing this wide - scale infringement to an end by pursuing the operators of the website or its subscribers			0
' in written argument before the court , submitting that the injunction application should be dismissed , @entity140 , for @entity12 , argued that if the court ordered it to block access to the newzbin2 website ' there would be nothing to stop countless other claimants coming forward demanding that @entity12 block other websites alleged to contain unlawful material '			0
rights holders in the music and movie industries ' have already identified 100 copyright infringing websites which they would like to see blocked '			0
@entity12 had heard ' verbal indications from rights holders ' representatives to the effect that they would like to see 400 sites a year blocked by @entity165 '			0
mr @entity166 added : ' nor would this flood of claims be restricted to copyright infringement			0
' claimants would seek orders blocking access to websites alleged to contain defamatory allegations or private and confidential information			0
' the case continues .			0

proceedings have been brought over the @entity24 website
loss to the film industry estimated at £ 477m in 2009 and £ 58m to the tv industry
