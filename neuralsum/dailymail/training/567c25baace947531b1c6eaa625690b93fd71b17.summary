by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 08:19 est , 15 january 2013 brave : @entity2 became the first person to survive a drop over the @entity5 in a barrel in 1901 before @entity8 , or even @entity9 , there was a daredevil with much humbler ambitions - but by no means less mettle			1
@entity2 was the first person to survive a trip over the @entity5 in a barrel in 1901			1
and her story is all the more extraordinary because it seems she never set out to become a record - breaker			2
after the death of her husband @entity19 in the @entity20 , she had lived a nomadic existing teaching on opposite coasts of the @entity23			2
but at the age of 62 , she was facing a grim financial future and possible retirement in the poorhouse			0
in a bid to secure her financial future , she decided to become the first person to drop over the @entity5 on her 63rd birthday			0
@entity2 believed her feat would bring her fame and fortune by selling memorabilia , group signings and giving talks			1
but although her achievement made headlines around the world at the time , it did n't quite work out as planned and she lived the rest of her life in relative poverty			1
the @entity44 reported how thousands of people gathered at the bottom of the @entity47 to witness her attempt , despite most thinking she stood little chance of surviving			2
@entity50 , @entity2 's manager , had been warned he could be charged with manslaughter if she died during the attempt the barrel was made from oak and iron and padded inside with a mattress @entity2 believed she would make fame and fortune through her death - defying feat over the @entity5 the tension was even more palpable for @entity2 's manager @entity62 who had been warned he could be prosecuted for manslaughter by both @entity65 and @entity23 police if she died			1
the custom - built barrel was around 1.4metres tall by 1m wide , made of oak and iron and padded with a mattress			2
after she got in a lid was put in place and a bicycle pump used to pressurize it			0
a 200lb anvil was used to weight it and it floated in an upright position through the rapids and down the 174 - foot fall			0
a crowd of thousands reportedly gathered to watch the attempt although most did n't believe @entity2 would survive her first words after emerging from the barrel were ' i prayed every second except when i went unconscious ' there were apparently several delays before the launch - particularly because no one wanted to be part of the potential suicide			1
much to their amazement , the crowd saw the barrel bob back to the surface after a 20 - minute journey over the edge			0
many then doubted that the woman inside would still be alive			0
but @entity2 emerged unscathed and suffering only from a degree of shock			1
she told reporters how she had momentarily gone unconscious during the trip but thanked @entity101 for her survival			0
according to reports , @entity2 's first words were : ' i prayed every second i was in the barrel except for a few seconds after the fall when i went unconscious			2
' ' nobody ought ever to do that again			0
if it was with my dying breath , i would caution anyone against attempting the feat. ' i would sooner walk up to the mouth of a cannon , knowing it was going to blow me to pieces than make another trip over the @entity120			0
' despite her achievement , @entity2 never achieved the wealth she desired , partly because her manager decamped with her barrel , and most of her savings were used towards private detectives hired to find it .			1

@entity2 made the attempt because she did n't want to be poor
*school* teacher thought the feat would bring her fame and fortune
police had *threatened* to charge her manager with manslaughter if she died
