’ an amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but serious condition that occurs when amniotic fluid — the fluid that surrounds a baby in the uterus during pregnancy — or foetal material , such as hair , enters the maternal bloodstream			1
why an amniotic fluid embolism occurs is n't well understood			1
it 's possible the fluid or foetal material enters the maternal bloodstream , possibly by passing through tears in the fetal membranes			0
it 's likely that amniotic fluid contains components that cause an inflammatory reaction and activate clotting in the mother 's lungs and blood vessels			1
however , amniotic fluid embolisms are rare - and it 's likely that some amniotic fluid commonly enters the maternal bloodstream during delivery without causing problems			1
it 's not clear why in some cases this leads to an amniotic fluid embolism .			1

@entity11 , 29 , died five hours after her daughter was delivered stillborn
inquest heard she died of a rare condition called amniotic fluid embolism
caused fluid from the baby to travel to her lungs and trigger a heart attack
