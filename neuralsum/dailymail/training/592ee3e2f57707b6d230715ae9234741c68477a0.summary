@entity1 was threatened with expulsion from the @entity3 for at least a decade if it dared to press ahead with a referendum on the single currency rescue deal , it emerged last night			1
on a day of drama worthy of the @entity1 stage , prime minister @entity6 hovered between defying @entity9 , resigning and forming a new government of national unity			1
a vote of confidence , expected at around 10pm tonight in the @entity1 parliament , could yet see the present government collapse			1
threat : @entity17 , pictured with @entity18 , has warned @entity1 not to reject the bailout package it was offered last week last night it was still not entirely clear what the @entity1 government has decided to do – though it is certain that mr @entity6 has been cowed into calling off his proposed referendum			1
@entity27 details then emerged of how @entity28 chancellor @entity17 threatened the @entity1 not only with an end to bailout cash and ejection from the single currency , but also expulsion from the @entity3 for at least ten years			2
but hopes in @entity9 that a new coalition government led by someone other than mr @entity6 could be installed were scuppered when the opposition insisted it would not join such an administration and instead demanded elections within six weeks			2
mr @entity6 had horrified other @entity3 leaders days ago by announcing that he would seek popular support for an agreement that would see half of @entity1 ’s towering debts written off in return for a decade of deeply unpopular austerity measures			1
pension payments are being slashed by 20 per cent , @entity46 has been hugely increased and a new property tax is being introduced			0
but economists argue the debt write - down is not dramatic enough to offer @entity1 any hope of emerging with a stronger economy			0
defiant : @entity1 's prime minister @entity6 speaking in parliament yesterday , when he insisted he was the right man for the job last night the @entity1 prime minister suggested he would be ready to drop a referendum on the bailout deal , as long as he could secure opposition support in @entity60			1
‘ if we had a consensus we would n’t have to go to a referendum , ’ he said			0
‘ if the opposition is willing to negotiate then we are ready to ratify this deal and implement it			0
’ however , mr @entity6 said the government was not afraid of asking the @entity1 people for their opinion in a referendum if necessary			1
@entity28 and @entity71 , fearing the single currency could collapse if the @entity1 voted ‘ no ’ , had already threatened to cut off existing cash lifelines for @entity73 until the vote was held			1
they also insisted any referendum must be on the country ’s future membership of the @entity3 and eurozone , rather than a more narrow question relating to deeply unpopular austerity measures , to maximise the chances of a ‘ yes ’ vote			0
and as the day went on , their threats escalated – culminating in the suggestion that @entity1 would not only have to ditch the euro and reinstate the drachma unless it supported the rescue deal , but also leave the @entity3			0
on his way out : mr @entity6 leaving the @entity92 summit on wednesday former @entity94 chancellor @entity93 said @entity1 was ‘ clearly going to fall out of the eurozone ’			1
but former @entity97 chancellor @entity96 insisted the eurozone bailout deal had unravelled and said throwing @entity1 out of the single currency is ‘ not going to solve the problem ’			2
he said : ‘ the real problem is that the @entity1 fix was never going to work			0
even if it had worked , it was still going to be left with a debt of 120 per cent of its gdp and that does n’t work			0
‘ the deal that they were being offered should never have been on the table			0
’ in a lengthy speech to the @entity1 parliament , mr @entity6 declared : ‘ for the last two years we have waged a battle of titanic proportions			2
our first duty being to fend off bankruptcy , to prevent the country collapsing			0
we were a guinea pig in a monetary union			0
‘ we are bearing a cross and , on top of that , they are throwing stones at us			1
’ he attacked mrs @entity17 and @entity71 president @entity125 for publicly humiliating @entity1 by ‘ telling us how to hold our referendum , defining the rules ’ .			2

@entity1 @entity130 's government could collapse as he faces confidence vote at 10pm tonight
@entity6 calls @entity134 referendum
he tells *mps* : ' we are bearing a cross and , on top of that , that they are throwing stones at us '
