by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity4 's promise to guarantee patients a @entity7 appointment within 48 hours could cost £ 3billion , doctors warned today			1
@entity8 has set aside just £ 100million to pay for the policy , launched last night to bolster support as polls put the @entity12 ahead for the first time in two years			1
today the @entity14 said the £ 3billion would need to be found from elsewhere in the @entity15 to reverse the ' erosion ' of funding to local surgeries over recent years			1
labour leader @entity4 announced plans to guarantee patients can get an appointment with their gp within 48 hours in a speech last night mr @entity4 said it was a ‘ scandal ’ that many patients have to wait days to be seen by a gp , and said his party would plough hundreds of millions of pounds into cutting waiting times			1
he claimed the £ 100million a year needed to fund shorter waiting times would be found by cutting back on @entity15 red tape and highly - paid consultants			2
but @entity30 , chairman of the @entity14 , said the money was not enough to fulfil the pledge			1
she told @entity33 's today programme : ' the £ 100 million is a start and it ’s a welcome start			0
it ’s not actually anywhere near enough to give any sort of guarantee			0
' when you look at it , it ’s around about £ 10,000 per practice			0
it certainly wo n’t go anywhere near employing at practice level more nurses , more gps			0
' at the moment the share of @entity15 funding that goes to general practice is just over 8 per cent			0
we see about 90 per cent of all @entity15 consultations			0
we believe that our share should be around about 11 per cent			0
' she said this was the equivalent of ' a rebalancing of £ 3billion because that is the share of the @entity15 budget that historically came to general practice that let us provide the service that patients value and want '			1
dr @entity30 added : ' that funding has been eroded over the years and we need to be able to balance @entity15 funding to deliver a proper general practice service			0
' @entity8 claimed that the number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent under the @entity69 , with one in four people have to wait a week to be seen			1
mr @entity4 visited @entity71 in @entity72 ahead of his policy launch , which has since been criticised for a lack of funding mr @entity4 said his ‘ guarantee ’ would prevent patients who can not get an appointment with their gp flooding @entity79 departments and would save the @entity15 more than £ 300million			1
‘ this will be better for patients , because they have better access to their gp surgery ; better for the @entity15 , because it will save money currently spent in @entity79 ; and better for @entity87 , because it is the kind of health service we need ’ , he said			0
the conservatives called it an ‘ unfunded pie in the sky policy ’ and said they had scrapped the 48 hour target because doctors found it counter-productive to patient care			1
mr @entity4 told an audience in @entity100 that @entity8 would allow patients to speak to a doctor or triage nurse , rather than a receptionist on the phone straightaway			1
if their condition is judged to need immediate attention they can see a gp the same day			0
all patients would have the right to see a gp at their own practice within 48 hours if they want to , although not necessarily the gp of their choice			0
the number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent under the @entity69 , mr @entity4 @entity116 at the @entity117 said last year when this policy was suggested that ‘ arbitrary targets , even for limited periods , are unlikely to alleviate the pressures on the @entity15 and could make the situation worse			1
he added : ‘ it is likely to result in a rush for appointments when practices open which could overwhelm gp services and restrict the freedom of @entity129 to schedule appointments beyond 48 hours for patients with long - term conditions			1
’ labour sources claimed the 48 hour guarantee would not be the same as the previous target , as patients who want to wait more than two days to see their own gp will still be able to			2
gps can spend the extra funding as they see fit , by hiring more staff or asking @entity129 to work longer hours			2
the cost would be funded by cutting £ 78million of administration and legal fees associated with @entity147 competition law , and reining in the £ 3million a month spending on consultants by three health quangos – monitor , the @entity152 and @entity153			0
mr @entity4 also told an audience of health workers that he would repeal the @entity156 – the law putting gps back in charge of health budgets			2
a @entity162 spokesman said : ' once again @entity8 's sums simply do n't add up			2
@entity4 promised ' iron discipline ' on spending , but he 's too weak to stick to it			2
he 's got no economic plan to secure @entity87 's future			0
' all he does offer are more of the same old failed @entity8 policies from the past - more spending , more borrowing and more taxes			2

@entity14 of @entity129 says £ 3billion is needed to fulfil the *ambitious* pledge
@entity4 said patients will have right to see family doctor in two days
last @entity8 government imposed target but was scrapped by *coalition*
doctors have previously warned against the setting more *regulations*
