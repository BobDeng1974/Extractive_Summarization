when biting , diving , brilliant @entity1 departed for @entity2 , the @entity0 had a vacancy for a bad - boy striker to be revered and detested in equal measures			1
after a successful six - month probation period , you can safely say @entity8 has landed himself the job			2
@entity11 's centre forward has been the single-most newsworthy player of the season			1
just like @entity1 , and @entity14 before him , sports editors can rely on at least 50 back - page splash stories a season from @entity8			1
@entity11 's 1 - 0 win against @entity18 on tuesday night to book a place in the @entity21 final at @entity22 was virtually a footnote alongside the @entity8 show			1
@entity8 is forging a reputation as the @entity0 's most explosive striker since @entity1 ( right ) @entity8 has been deadly in front of goal since his move to @entity11 , as this strike against @entity31 showed @entity1 was also a lethal finisher at @entity18 , with this long - range volley against @entity34 a highlight @entity8 showed his dark side with this stamp on @entity38 , for which he was somehow not sent off @entity1 was never far away from controversy , and he bit @entity11 's @entity41 at @entity42 in april 2013 he trod on @entity43 and @entity38 – @entity18 manager @entity44 broke off usual diplomatic protocol to use the term ' stamp ' to describe the challenge on can - failed to win a certain penalty because of his reputation for diving , and was regularly taunted by @entity18 fans			1
in terms of having the emotions stirred , it was like having @entity1 back			2
@entity56 does is tinged with controversy , and of course he can play too			0
@entity59 wo n't care , of course			2
he bought @entity8 from @entity61 not for his silky technical skills but for his goalscoring ability and refusal to back away from a fight			2
born in @entity66 and honed in @entity67 , @entity8 has strength and power , and uses it			1
he ignored the common consensus that it takes time for outsiders to adjust to the @entity0 and banged in seven goals in his first four games , leaving @entity59 to make favourable comparisons with @entity76 , a genuine club legend			1
@entity8 also appeared to stamp on @entity43 's right leg during tuesday 's feisty @entity21 semi-final @entity8 is never one to back down from a fight , and he clashed with can after the incident at @entity81 @entity8 and @entity38 also squared up after the other stamp incident against @entity18 @entity8 was unlucky not to win a penalty , however , when @entity38 clearly tripped him in the area @entity8 also appeared to grab @entity18 captain @entity86 's throat in yet another violent incident @entity86 grabbed @entity8 after the scuffle and the pair had to be separated by team - mates the controversial striker celebrates after @entity41 's winner at @entity81 in extra-time he irritates opponents in a way @entity1 used to			1
the @entity96 thought nothing of diving , handling , biting , snarling at officials or abusing opponents in order to win			0
@entity8 arrived in @entity102 with a reputation			2
@entity61 fans loved him for clashing with @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 in a @entity61 derby			0
it was harder to excuse a headbutt on a @entity112 player that got him a red card in the @entity114			1
but he arrived with pedigree too			0
his goals fired @entity61 to the @entity118 title and a @entity114 final last season			0
the price tag of £ 32million certainly was n't cheap but @entity121 paid around the same for @entity122 , so it was n't extortionate either			2
in only his third game , @entity8 showed he is different			2
following a hard - fought tussle with @entity128 , the @entity126 defender scored an own goal , and @entity8 felt obliged to give him an earful about it			0
@entity126 were n't happy , @entity11 fans loved it			0
their man had been the subject of some rough treatment and was getting revenge			0
since then , he 's hardly been out of the news			0
against @entity31 , @entity8 scored a hat - trick and lashed out at @entity139			0
frustrated by @entity140 , he caught @entity141 with a flailing arm and picked up a fifth booking that got him suspended			0
he was booked against @entity144 for simulation			0
he 's argued with countless defenders including @entity121 's @entity147			1
@entity148 of @entity149 is on the wrong end of some foul play by @entity1 at @entity42 in 2012 @entity1 was not afraid to cheat to win , as this clear handball before scoring against @entity154 in 2013 showed he was also not shy of diving , such as when he tumbled over @entity156 to win a penalty in january last year @entity1 became infamous across the globe when he bit @entity160 defender @entity159 at the @entity161 the @entity163 striker , who has now joined @entity2 ( right ) , gives a linesman a piece of his mind in 2011 but he is no @entity167 , @entity168 or @entity169 , who deal exclusively in controversy			1
like @entity1 , @entity8 is among the best players in the @entity0 and should @entity11 go on to win the title he will be a leading contender for @entity173			1
when someone is that good , you can get away with plenty			0
@entity8 has scored 17 goals in 19 @entity0 games and at the age of 26 is just about to enter his prime			1
@entity76 was 26 when he first signed for @entity11 and got better with age			0
no wonder @entity59 is prepared to defend his star man			0
the @entity184 are looking to clamp down on stamping incidents , but he has already ruled that @entity8 's contact with can was ' accidental '			1
asked if the player 's aggressive nature could be a problem , @entity59 snapped back : ' i do n't agree '			2
we feared the @entity0 would be a duller place without @entity1			1
with @entity8 around , the vacuum has been filled			0
the next headline ca n't be far away			0
@entity8 shows off his ripped shirt following another physical battle against @entity18 in november last year the @entity67 striker got away with striking @entity31 's @entity139 in september 2014 @entity128 ( left ) received a tongue - lashing from @entity8 after scoring an own goal in august			1

@entity8 helped @entity11 beat @entity18 in @entity21 semi-final
but @entity8 was *accused* of stamping on @entity43 and @entity38
@entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 said @entity8 *deserved* red card
@entity59 has *blasted* @entity8 's *critics* *...* but he could be banned for title *showdown* with @entity121 on *saturday*
the @entity67 striker is the natural heir to @entity1 in the @entity0
both strikers have outrageous talent but volatile *temperament*
