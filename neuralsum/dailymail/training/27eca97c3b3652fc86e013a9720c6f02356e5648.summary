@entity0 and @entity1 have been shielded from spending cuts of around £ 800million because of ‘ flaws ’ in the formula used to calculate how much public money they should receive			1
a report from the @entity8 revealed the unfairness of the so - called @entity10 – which decides how funds are distributed between nations of the @entity13 – is getting worse , with every person in @entity0 an extra £ 113 better off than people in @entity16 and @entity17 , and £ 110 per person in @entity1			1
as a result of spending reviews in 2010 and 2013 , devolved administrations were spared cuts totalling around £ 600million in @entity0 and £ 200million in @entity1			1
the @entity10 creator , @entity23 , who died earlier this month			1
a new report has revealed the growing unfairness of the system the formula ’s creator , @entity23 , who died earlier this month , had called for reform of the 35 - year - old system , which he said was unfair and out of date			1
but the @entity32 insisted it ‘ will continue ’			0
the report ’s author , @entity33 , said : ‘ @entity0 and @entity1 avoided cuts that @entity16 and @entity17 have faced			1
’ @entity37 mps said the report will fuel new pressure on ministers to reform the spending formula which dates from the 1970s			2
but the @entity32 insisted the @entity43 formula ‘ will continue ’			0
former minister @entity44 said the report would fuel public anger about the injustice of the formula – and insisted it could not remain in place			2
‘ what this shows is that the formula is flawed and is not fit for purpose			0
any suggestion that it can be left in place unchanged is not going to be acceptable to people in other parts of the @entity13			2
’ ‘ this is one further example of the injustice of it and the lack of transparency			0
’ ‘ my constituents are concerned that they can not get free prescriptions and help with long term care for the elderly and free tuition fees , when these are things that are freely available in @entity0			2
’ the existing formula , which has been the source of resentment in @entity16 for many years , means that public spending per head is £ 1,623 a year higher in @entity0 than in @entity16			1
around two thirds of @entity16 mps want to axe @entity23 , including 83 per cent of conservatives			2
but during the @entity0 referendum campaign , amid panic about the prospect of a yes vote for independence , all three party leaders pledged to continue using the formula			2
today ’s report reveals that technical details in the way business rates are allocated across different parts of the country is making the discrepancy worse			2
as a result of the spending reviews in 2010 and 2013 , devolved administrations were spared cuts totalling around £ 600 million in @entity0 and £ 200 million in @entity1 , compared to @entity16 and @entity17 , the @entity95 , pictured , were spared spending cuts worth £ 600million in 2010 and 2013 , according to the research in the decade from 2000 , the flaw was worth some £ 400million to @entity0 – meaning it is now some £ 1billion higher than it otherwise would be			1
that amounts to three per cent of the @entity103 ’s budget			0
the problem could get even worse , as further taxes when further taxes - stamp duty , land and landfill taxes - are to be devolved early next year			0
ministers are yet to decide how the grants will be adjusted as a result – raising fears it could mean @entity16 and @entity17 are even more worse off			2
the report ’s author @entity33 , a senior research economist at the @entity8 , called for the issue to be corrected ‘ the @entity23 formula looks set to remain in place for some years to come			0
this appears to rule out a move to a needs - based formula , ’ said mr @entity33			0
‘ but it makes it more important than ever to examine the @entity23 formula to see if it is working in the way intended , and if flaws are found , to fix them			0
‘ problems with the way the @entity23 formula treats business rates mean that @entity0 and @entity1 have avoided hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts that they would have faced under a corrected formula - cuts that @entity16 and @entity17 have faced			1
‘ it is important to get the interaction between devolved taxes and the @entity23 formula right			0
whatever is decided about which taxes should be devolved , it is crucial to get right the seemingly technical issue of exactly how changes in revenues from those taxes translate into changes in funding			0
’ in @entity0 and @entity1 , business rates are fully devolved to the administrations in @entity146 and @entity147 , pictured the @entity23 formula decides how central funds are distributed between the nations of the @entity13			1
in @entity0 and @entity1 , business rates are fully devolved to the administrations in @entity146 and @entity147 , while in @entity16 the formula treats them as a contribution towards the @entity154 ’s budget for local authorities			1
the anomaly means block grants to @entity0 and @entity1 being cut by much less than the average reduction faced by departments serving @entity16 , the @entity8 said			1
business rates are only partially devolved to @entity17 at present , with full devolution set to occur in april 2015			0
a @entity32 spokesman said : ‘ the arrangements for business rates in @entity0 and @entity1 have been in place since devolution in the late 1990s			1
‘ like all other areas of spending , the treatment of local government spending in the @entity10 is based on the level of devolution of services , not on individual revenue streams like business rates			1
‘ the leaders of all three main @entity13 parties have been clear that the @entity23 formula will continue			0
as the report suggests , we will therefore need to put in place arrangements to ensure that neither the @entity182 or @entity183 gain or lose from further devolution			0
ensuring that the risks and rewards associated with decisions taken by the devolved administrations are borne by them , and that mechanisms exist to adjust the block grant accordingly , will be a key consideration			0

a new report has revealed the growing unfairness of the @entity10
every person in @entity0 is an extra £ 113 better of than people in @entity16
in @entity1 people are £ 110 per person better off , the report says
spending reviews mean devolved *parliaments* were spared cuts worth £ 800million *combined*
