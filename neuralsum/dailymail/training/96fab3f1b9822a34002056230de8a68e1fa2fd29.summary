royal tours are often thought to be a modern phenomenon but as these rare photos demonstrate , the @entity2 has been travelling abroad on diplomatic missions for hundreds of years			0
but while the international efforts of the likes of @entity12 and @entity13 are only remembered in paintings , the future @entity7 's 1862 tour of the @entity8 was documented by a photographer - the first time a royal tour had been recorded this way			1
like prince @entity18 and the @entity19 in @entity20 and @entity21 , the then @entity7 spent much of his time meeting local dignitaries and politicians , although at four - months , the visit was considerably longer than today 's short tours			2
royal tour : the @entity7 ( centre , in white ) exploring the @entity30 at @entity31 ( near @entity33 capital @entity34 ) on 5th march 1862 lunch in the @entity35 : @entity7 ( second left ) and his companions have lunch on the shores of the @entity39 and while modern royal tours have an entirely diplomatic function , @entity42 - as he was then known - was sent abroad by his mother @entity43 for a different reason - to keep him occupied between finishing university and getting married			1
despite coming just two months after the death of @entity42 senior , @entity43 was determined that the visit should go ahead			0
travelling in unusually low - key style , the bereaved prince got around on horseback and slept in tents as he toured the region , meeting rulers , politicians and ambassadors as he went			0
accompanying the two princes on the tour , which took in @entity33 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , was photographer @entity65 who used techniques that had been pioneered barely 20 years before			1
at the time , the idea of photographing a royal tour was a new concept , with @entity72 's presence on the tour the result of @entity43 and @entity42 's interest in photography			1
@entity65 had already impressed the @entity43 with his photographs of places associated with @entity42 's childhood in @entity80 , an earlier royal commission which secured his place on the trip			1
impressive : @entity7 and his companions take a break during their visit to the @entity86 at @entity87 during his 1862 visit to @entity33 striking : the temple complex , which is close to the modern city of @entity91 , was founded in 3200 bc and is dedicated to @entity92 pilgrimage : also on @entity7 's agenda was a visit to @entity96 ( pictured ) and @entity97 , which today , is the capital of @entity60 busy : although a diplomatic mission , the future @entity7 's trip to the @entity8 was also designed , by his mother @entity43 , to keep him occupied in mid-february 1862 , the @entity103 announced that the @entity7 was to be accompanied by ' eight gentlemen only ' , including mr @entity65 , on a tour to be undertaken ' in as private a manner as possible '			1
the main purpose of @entity65 's work was to capture historic and sacred landscapes – the young prince and his companions appear in only three of the 191 surviving photographs , all of which are to go on display in the @entity117 at @entity118 from this weekend			1
two of these were taken in @entity33 , showing the party in front of the pyramids at @entity31 and at the @entity124 at @entity87 , ancient @entity125			1
in the third , they are having lunch under a fig tree at @entity129 , on the northern shore of the @entity39			2
the rest of the photographs reflect a growing public demand for romantic images of biblical sites , @entity33 and @entity137 ruins , and mosques			0
by the 1860s leisure travel to the @entity8 was increasing , stimulated by major archaeological discoveries in the region			0
the introduction of steamships to @entity144 in 1840 also gave @entity33 's fledgling tourism industry a boost , thanks to the reduction in journey times which made the area more accessible for @entity152 pilgrims and tourists			2
in his lifetime , @entity65 was considered one of the greatest @entity157 photographers , and on his return from the @entity8 many of his photographs of the royal tour were exhibited to the public in a gallery on new @entity164			1
among those now on display for the first time since then are views of the @entity169 of @entity170 and of the @entity86 at @entity171 on the west bank of the @entity173 , in which @entity65 's portable darkroom can be seen in the shadow of the temple			0
@entity65 would have had to take a large amount of equipment with him , including plates , tripods , lenses , chemicals and a darkroom , as well as the camera itself			0
' today royal tours are widely photographed , and the pictures are transmitted instantly around the world , ' comments curator @entity189			0
' @entity72 's photographs were not seen by the public until over a month after the royal party 's return to @entity194 , but his presence on the tour was widely reported in the press			0
' the intense interest in his work at the time shows just how innovative and ground - breaking a move it was to invite @entity65 to accompany the tour			2
' but @entity65 's photos are n't the only record of the tour			2
@entity42 splashed out on antiquities , picking up ancient @entity33 papyri and other artifacts as he went along			0
one , which will go on display alongside @entity65 's photographs , is an ancient @entity33 papyrus inscribed with the @entity213 , a funerary text which describes the journey of regeneration of @entity92 , the @entity33 sun god			1
others include pottery vessels from an excavation on the island of @entity222 and a poignant marble fragment from @entity61 inscribed ' from the remains of the @entity225 at @entity226 , may			0
then , as now , the country was beset by a bloody war , this time between the @entity227 and the @entity228 , which saw the @entity230 quarter in @entity226 burned to the ground			0
all change : modern royal tours attract hordes of photographers ( back ) and are both less formal and considerably shorter collector : @entity7 also used his tour of the @entity8 as an opportunity to purchase antiquities such as this papyrus scroll ruler : the then @entity42 later went on to rule @entity7 and became father to @entity245 and grandfather to @entity247 technology : like his parents who championed photography , @entity7 loved new technology and championed the car			1

the future @entity7 's tour of the @entity8 in 1862 was the first to be documented by a photographer
@entity257 , which was made on horseback and involved camping , took in @entity33 , @entity61 , @entity60 , @entity64 , @entity63 and @entity62
photographer @entity65 was one of the small group to travel with the @entity7 on the tour
was commissioned by @entity43 who took a keen interest in photography , which was then just 20 years old
@entity7 is seen visiting the @entity30 and the @entity124 at @entity87 , and having lunch by the @entity39
@entity34 to @entity269 : @entity270 of the @entity8 opens on *friday* in @entity271 , @entity118
