growing up , @entity0 always dreamed of following in the footsteps of his idol @entity2			1
his journey to @entity4 , signing for @entity5 for £ 7million this summer , and development as a player have been so similar to the @entity8 great they could practically have worn the same shoes			1
both were born in @entity12 , @entity13 , but travelled through @entity14 to gain their footballing education as teenagers in various countries before ending up in the @entity18			1
@entity2 moved to @entity19 and then @entity20 before landing in @entity21 at @entity8			1
@entity0 ’s route was even longer			1
in pursuit of football he moved first to @entity25 , leaving his family behind , then to @entity19 and finally @entity27 before he found @entity4 this summer			2
@entity29 man : new @entity5 man @entity0 joined the @entity5 from @entity30 in a £ 7million deal but their similarities stretch further than simple geography			1
they are both 6ft 4in and of a similar imposing build			2
both are known on the football field for their immense physicality and tough tackling			2
t was not long before the comparisons came when @entity0 finally broke into the first - team at @entity44 in 2007 aged 18			1
‘ when i started playing in @entity27 i played 10 matches and people began comparing me with @entity2 , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ it was an immense pleasure to be compared to such a fantastic player because he was a role model for us @entity13 and an inspiration			2
‘ when he showed how good he was , he made us dream and aspire to achieve similar things			2
i know it will be tough			2
now it is up to me that i deserve the comparison			0
‘ to do that , i need to give the best to my team			0
i hope to achieve just a bit of what he achieved			0
i know it will be difficult			0
it is now up to me to show my qualities and play like i can			0
’ idol : @entity0 has followed in the footsteps of his hero @entity2 in making it to the @entity18 thumbs up : @entity0 poses with fellow @entity5 new boys @entity70 ( left ) and @entity71 ( centre ) it was that ‘ obsession , ’ as @entity0 describes it , to get to @entity21 that drove him on when he felt lonely and homesick and wanted to give it all up			1
the first three months away from home were the hardest , but it is this experience which , he believes , gives him the mental strength for the @entity21 top flight			0
‘ it was so difficult that i wanted to go back to @entity13 , ’ he said			0
‘ it was the first time i had left my country without my family , i had nothing and was completely on my own			0
it was the first time i had seen snow			0
‘ but i spoke to my grandmother and my mum on the telephone and they told me to stay put			0
i was on my own a lot of the time , but i got used to it			0
it was then my mental strength began to increase , i became tougher			0
’ big move : @entity0 moved to @entity27 from @entity13 and made his debut for @entity30 at the age of 18 in 2007 his mother and brother are getting loose ends tied up with work in @entity13 but plan to move over here			1
there is talk of december , but they may wait until next summer so the temperature is not such a shock to the system			2
luckily , through his travels , @entity0 is fully prepared for the cold , wet and windy evening and afternoon games ahead			1
he played with @entity111 at @entity30 , where he signed from this summer , and garnered advice from him			1
he also spoke to other @entity13 players @entity114 and @entity115			0
he added : ‘ @entity114 said i need to work hard , concentrate in training and that i must n’t hold back			0
’ when @entity0 takes to the field at @entity118 against @entity119 this afternoon [ @entity120 ] , provided he does not hold back he will be a step closer to emulating his idol .			1
