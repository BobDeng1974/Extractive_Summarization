the government is planning to mitigate the damage caused by adding vat to pasties by introducing a new ‘ green ’ tax on chilled champagne			1
a @entity6 leaked today proposes a ‘ @entity8 ( @entity7 ) ’ that would add a nine per cent duty to all chilled champagne sold in public places			1
if implemented , the average price of a bottle sold in a restaurant would rise from £ 37.50 to £ 40.86			1
topped up : an unidentified delivery man waits to deliver boxes of champagne to 11 @entity18 chancellor @entity19 plans to present this as an environmental measure			1
experts agree that champagne is best served at about 43 to @entity24 ( 6 to @entity25 )			1
this can be achieved by placing a room - temperature bottle in a fridge on a medium setting for three to four hours			2
however , this increases the carbon footprint of the typical wine bar by 0.05 per cent			2
multiplied many times over the course of a typical evening , the @entity6 argues , this is a significant amount			2
chancellor @entity19 plans to present the move as an environmental measure according to the government , some establishments in the @entity39 , and in @entity40 , the @entity41 village infamous as a playground for footballers ’ wives , use as much energy chilling champagne in a single evening as a medium - size hospital expends on light and heating			1
serving warm champagne , says no 10 , is good for the environment			1
the @entity54 attack on champagne drinkers could be seen as a political manoeuvre to counter angry concerns that the ‘ pasty tax ’ was an upper - class assault on a working - class snack			1
but the sight of ten crates of champagne being delivered to no 11 @entity18 ahead of the ‘ bubbly tax ’ is unlikely to convince voters that ‘ we ’re all in this together ’			1
meanwhile , wine merchants are demanding to know why champagne is targeted but not prosecco and cava , as bar owners and restaurateurs protest over what they see as an attack on their livelihoods			1
and the @entity76 say that they have always been against the levy – but claim they successfully lobbied their @entity79 partners to exempt @entity80 and @entity81			2
a host of @entity84 pages have been set up to oppose the measure			2
‘ @entity86 , @entity7 ’ , purporting to have been created by the @entity87 , the notorious @entity89 drinking society for aristocrats , has attracted more than 800 ‘ likes ’			1
another , called ‘ chill , @entity94 ! ’ , claiming to represent staff at the investment bank @entity96 , has 500 supporters			0
a group of backbench @entity99 hurriedly formed their own protest group which they gleefully named ‘ @entity102 ’ , all memories of @entity105 ’s politically damaging cider tax of 2010 conveniently forgotten			0
@entity106 : @entity107 became embroiled in a pasty tax fiasco when he was apparently caught telling fibs about his love of the hot snacks the @entity102 ’ chosen spokesman was , perhaps inevitably , @entity113 , mp for @entity114			0
he said in a statement : ‘ @entity7 is what toffs quaff			1
if the @entity118 want to punish the people who vote for them with this brut - al tax , that ’s their look - out			0
on the other hand , why should n’t the working man have a glass of bubbly ? after all , he ’s earned it			0
’ and the newly elected mp for @entity128 , @entity129 , of the @entity131 party , and a teetotaller , declared : ‘ this government has popped its cork , lost its fizz and gone flat			0
it is a government of champagne charlies in a parliament of pusillanimous poltroons			2
it is a tyranny of tipsy tycoons			0
’ but the government has already started to backtrack			0
a @entity143 source said : ‘ look , this was something dreamed up by the pm and @entity19 over a couple of bottles of @entity148 ’ 66 to try to show that they ’re just regular guys			0
‘ we never said it was going to be policy			0
they ’re just for larks , really			0
‘ there ’s no doubt that march has been a very bad month for us but we ’re going to draw a line under it and move on			0
‘ we wo n’t be april fools			0

' @entity8 ( @entity7 ) would add 9 *%* duty to all chilled champagne sold in public places
