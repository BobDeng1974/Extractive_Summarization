triple @entity1 champion @entity0 admits he has had to bulk up to keep pace with the changing dynamics of the men 's sprint			1
@entity0 won gold in both the team and individual sprint at @entity9 , having been selected ahead of sir @entity10 for the latter , having taken his first @entity1 gold in the team event four years earlier			1
but the 26 - year - old @entity15 boy was jolted back to reality in the @entity17 at @entity18 in march when he was edged into fifth place			2
improve : @entity0 ( right ) has had to bulk up to keep pace with the changing dynamics of men all of the men who finished above him there were heavier , more powerful riders than @entity0			1
having failed to beat them in @entity29 , @entity0 's next plan is to join them by tipping the scales when he rides for @entity32 at next week 's @entity33 in @entity34			1
' i was fifth at the @entity37 and everyone in front of me was bigger , the average was probably 10 kilos more than me , ' he said			0
' a lot of big guys are winning races now so i have to kind of step up and match that			0
' i 've had to gain a bit of weight and strength because the landscape 's changing a bit in sprint racing			0
' since the @entity17 i 've gained four kilos and that does n't sound a lot but it is for me because i 'm really consistent with my weight			0
' right now is the heaviest i 've ever been but you have to gain useful weight			0
you do put a bit of chub on , it 's impossible not too , but i try and overshoot then come back down again			0
' @entity0 and girlfriend @entity61 , who also hopes to be among the medals for @entity32 , made some waves in recent weeks for suggesting the @entity33 did not feature too high on their agendas			1
ready : @entity0 takes part in a @entity32 training session ahead of the 2014 @entity33 he does not deny that remains the case , but is warming to the task ahead of him - as well as the chance to complete a hat - trick of @entity1 , @entity72 and @entity33 titles			1
' i always try to be honest			0
@entity61 and i were honest when we said the programme was n't funded for the @entity76 , it 's funded for the @entity1			2
' individually we 're funded for the @entity1 too and that 's just the truth			2
' when you look at the programme sat in an office or at a team meeting that 's all that matters , but when you start training and put the fast wheels on these things get a bit more serious and come race day this will be really important			0
' ideally i 'd like to compete the set with @entity33 gold because that would be the three major championships - olympics , @entity37 and @entity94 for me			1
' at the double : @entity0 won gold in both the team and individual sprint at @entity9			2

@entity0 *reveals* he has had to bulk up ahead of the 2014 @entity33
