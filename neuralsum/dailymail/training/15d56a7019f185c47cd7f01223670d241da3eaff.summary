what started as simple shapes made from pancake batter to amuse his children has turned into three - dimensional sculptures and replicas of famous artworks			1
@entity15 spends hours creating edible art , sharing photographs of his pancake masterpieces on his blog before it is gobbled up for breakfast in what he calls his ‘ madness ’			1
that 's pancake batter : cook @entity15 started making letters out of pancake batter to amuse his children but now spends hours creating amazing replicas like this plate of tacos , steak , chips and salad on his blog @entity33 , the 53 - year - old calls himself a ' pancake artist ' and that ' the time has come to reveal my madness '			1
breakfast never looked so artistic , with pancake batter whipped into replicas of other foods such as tacos , steak and chips , @entity46 trees or a mouse caught in a trap complete with red syrup to show his sticky end			1
artist @entity52 would surely be licking his lips had he seen mr @entity15 ’s attempt to recreate his famous painting @entity56			2
intricate eating : mr @entity15 uses a bottle with nozzle to create intricate designs such as this mouse caught in a mousetrap complete with red syrup to show his sticky end from paint to pancake : the cook adjusts the cooking heat to control the colour and texture of the batter to recreate famous artworks such as @entity56 by @entity52 ( left ) mr @entity15 , a professional juggler from @entity74 , @entity75 said : ‘ i make pancakes for breakfast for my children @entity79 , 10 , and @entity80 , 12			1
‘ this started when they were very young			0
i wanted to make something that would get them excited about eating so i made the first letter of each of their names			0
‘ they loved them and their excitement led me to up my game			0
’ breakfast blog : mr @entity15 takes photos of his edible art , posting them on his @entity33 blog before they are gobbled up three dimensional breakfast : the ' next step into crazy ' was three dimensional animals , mr @entity15 said			1
he used a breakfast sausage to thread several pancakes together to create a pig ( right ) the pancake artist uses a bottle with a nozzle to pipe intricate sections and adjusts the cooking heat to control the colour and texture of the batter			1
he said : ‘ i put the batter into a squeeze bottle , and i found i could do letters and easy shapes and designs			2
‘ for the first couple of years i only worked with getting different tones of brown by timing the placement of different parts of the batter			0
syrup for slime : this pancake snail left a trail of slime ( syrup ) on the breakfast plate amusing breakfast : mr @entity15 started with letters to get his children @entity80 , 12 , and @entity79 ( pictured ) , 10 , excited about eating ‘ the next step into crazy was the idea that i could make a three dimensional pancake			2
‘ i made a pig 's face , several regular pancakes and a pig 's butt and threaded them all onto a breakfast sausage and put the whole thing into a pool of syrup			0
‘ that lead to the @entity146 snail with a syrup trail all the way across the table and then into a new technique of stacking different pancake pieces to build something complex			0
favourite food : once he discovered that pancake batter takes on food colouring really well to make vibrant colours , mr @entity15 extended his creations to trees			1
his favourite is the @entity160 ( right ) mr @entity15 then experimented with food colouring , using it to recreate almost real looking replicas			0
he said : ‘ my next discovery was how well pancake batter accepts food colouring , if you put in a lot of it you get very vibrant colours			2
‘ i made a colour wheel to demonstrate this but my favourite version of these is the christmas tree			0
‘ it combines the simple stacking with the bright colours and makes what i think is a beautiful and very simple pancake			0
