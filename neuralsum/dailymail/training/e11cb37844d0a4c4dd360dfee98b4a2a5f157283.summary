@entity0 has opened the world 's longest cross-sea bridge - which stretches five miles further than the distance between @entity4 and @entity5			1
the @entity6 is 26.4 miles long and links @entity0 's eastern port city of @entity8 to the offshore island @entity10			1
the road bridge , which is 110ft wide and is the longest of its kind , cost nearly £ 1billion to build			0
a bridge over misty waters : the immense £ 1billion structure which is supported by more than 5,000 pillars stretches for 24 miles along @entity0 's eastern port city of @entity8 to the offshore island @entity10 engineering feat : the vast bridge , the largest cross-ocean bridge in the world , cost £ 960million and took four years to build @entity0 tv reports said the bridge passed construction appraisals on monday and it , along with an undersea tunnel , would be opened for traffic today			1
it took four years to build the bridge , which is supported by more than 5,000 pillars across the bay , and it is almost three miles longer than the previous record - holder - the @entity33 in @entity34			1
lengthy : the bridge stretches into the distance further than the eye can see and right , the first few cars roll out across the surface open road : drivers pass through the mist as they make some of the first passes over the 110ft wide bridge which is longer than any others of its kind flowers : the first vehicle runs into toll station to the applause of staff and passers - by after the bridge opened to traffic today musical mileage : a brass band plays on the sides of the road as flags and banners herald in the opening of the bridge the start of things to come : two cars edge through the toll gates that will raise revenue to maintain the £ 1billion bridge that structure features two bridges running side by side and is 23.87 miles long			1
the three - way @entity75 bridge is 174 times longer than @entity77 's @entity76 , spanning the @entity78 , but cuts only 19 miles off the drive from @entity8 to @entity10			2
two separate groups of workers have been building it from different ends of the structure since 2006			0
after linking the two ends of the bridge on december 22 , one engineer said : ' the computer models and calculations are all very well but you ca n't relax until the two sides are bolted together			0
do n't keep me hanging : the suspension beams form an imposing sight as the reach through the clouds and look down upon colourful flags marking the bridge 's grand opening the long road home : the two roads which run alongside each other wind across the @entity6 ' even a few centimetres out would have been a disaster			2
' the engineering feat will only hold the record as the longest sea bridge for a few years - it will be beaten by another @entity0 bridge in the next decade			0
last december officials announced workers had begun constructing a bridge to link southern @entity113 province with @entity114 and @entity115			0
set to be completed in 2016 , officials said the £ 6.5billion bridge will span nearly 30 miles			2
it will be designed to cope with earthquakes up to magnitude 8.0 , strong typhoons and the impact of a 300,000 tonne vessel			0
but both structures will still be dwarfed by the longest bridge in the world , also in @entity0			0
the @entity125 is an astonishing 102 miles in length			2
record breaker : the @entity129 bay bridge , spanning 26.4 miles between @entity8 and @entity10 , will open for traffic today impressive : testing on the bridge was completed on monday and it is expected to be opened to traffic for the first time today a driver 's dream : twenty - four miles of fresh untouched tarmac stretch from @entity8 to @entity138			1

at 26.4 miles long , it is five miles further than the distance between @entity4 and @entity5
