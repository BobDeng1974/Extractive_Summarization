it could be the mightiest wind ever seen - strong enouigh to stop a galaxy from producing stars			0
@entity5 's @entity4 ( @entity4 ) and @entity6 's ( @entity6 ) @entity8 telescope have spotted fierce winds from a supermassive black hole blow outward in all directions			1
the phenomenon had been suspected , but now researchers have proved the winds are powerful enough to inhibit the host galaxy 's ability to make new stars			0
observations have revealed cosmic winds emerging from near the black hole at the center of @entity19 and galaxies like it			1
supermassive black holes blast matter into their host galaxies , with x-ray - emitting winds traveling at up to one - third the speed of light			1
in the new study , astronomers determined @entity34 , an extremely bright black hole known as a quasar more than 2 billion light - years away , sustains winds that carry more energy every second than is emitted by more than a trillion suns			1
' we know black holes in the centers of galaxies can feed on matter , and this process can produce winds			2
this is thought to regulate the growth of the galaxies , ' said @entity49 of the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) in @entity51 , @entity52 , the led the study			0
@entity54 is the principal investigator of @entity4 and a co-author on a new paper about these results appearing in the journal @entity59			0
' knowing the speed , shape and size of the winds , we can now figure out how powerful they are			0

in the new study , astronomers determined @entity34 , an extremely bright black hole known as a quasar more than 2 billion light - years away , sustains winds that carry more energy every second than is emitted by more than a trillion suns			1
' now we know quasar winds significantly contribute to mass loss in a galaxy , driving out its supply of gas , which is fuel for star formation , ' said the study 's lead author @entity82 of @entity84 in @entity85			0
@entity4 and @entity8 simultaneously observed @entity34 on five separate occasions in 2013 and 2014			2
the space telescopes complement each other by observing different parts of the x-ray light spectrum : @entity8 views low - energy and @entity4 views high - energy			2
previous @entity8 observations had identified black hole winds blowing toward us , but could not determine whether the winds also blew in all directions			1
@entity8 had detected iron atoms , which are carried by the winds along with other matter , only directly in front of the black hole , where they block x-rays			1
combining higher - energy x-ray data from @entity4 with observations from @entity8 , scientists were able to find signatures of iron scattered from the sides , proving the winds emanate from the black hole not in a beam , but in a nearly spherical fashion			1
supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies blast out radiation and ultra-fast winds , as illustrated in this artist 's conception			2
@entity5 's @entity4 and @entity6 's @entity8 telescopes show that these winds , containing highly ionized atoms , blow in a nearly spherical fashion			0
' this is a great example of the synergy between @entity8 and @entity4 , ' said @entity129 , @entity8 project scientist at @entity6			0
' the complementarity of these two x-ray observatories is enabling us to unveil previously hidden details about the powerful side of the universe			0
' with the shape and extent of the winds known , the researchers could then determine the strength of the winds and the degree to which they can inhibit the formation of new stars			0
astronomers think supermassive black holes and their home galaxies evolve together and regulate each other 's growth			0
evidence for this comes in part from observations of the central bulges of galaxies -- the more massive the central bulge , the larger the supermassive black hole			2
@entity4 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) simultaneously observed @entity34 on five separate occasions in 2013 and 2014			2
this latest report demonstrates a supermassive black hole and its high - speed winds greatly affect the host galaxy			1
as the black hole bulks up in size , its winds push vast amounts of matter outward through the galaxy , which ultimately stops new stars from forming			1
because @entity34 is relatively close , by cosmic standards , it is bright and can be studied in detail			2
this black hole gives astronomers a unique look into a distant era of our universe , around 10 billion years ago , when supermassive black holes and their raging winds were more common and possibly shaped galaxies as we see them today			1
' for an astronomer , studying @entity34 is like a paleontologist being given a living dinosaur to study , ' said study co-author @entity187 of @entity5 's @entity188 ( @entity188 ) in @entity51			0
' we are able to investigate the physics of these important systems with a level of detail not possible for those found at more typical distances , during the ' @entity196			0

@entity34 , an extremely bright black hole 2 billion light - years away studied
sustains winds that carry more energy every second than is emitted by more than a trillion suns
