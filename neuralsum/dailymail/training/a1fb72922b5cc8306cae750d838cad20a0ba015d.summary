and the benefits of bottled water are so valued that it costs up to 1,000 times more than what comes out of our taps			1
but far from being healthier , the bottled variety is subject to far less stringent safety tests than tap water			1

the warning suggests that much of the £ 1.5billion - plus @entity23 pay for bottled water each year in the belief that it is better for us is spent mistakenly			1

almost a quarter of people who drink bottled water at home say they do so because they believe it is ‘ better for them ’ than tap water , according to market researchers @entity38			1
but what these consumers may not realise is that tap water must be checked daily under a rigorous inspection regime			2

‘ there ’s certainly a greater chance you could find something harmful in bottled water than from your taps			2
‘ ideally it should be drunk on the day it is opened , as it can easily pick up bacteria from someone ’s hands or face			0
’ batches of bottled water have had to be removed from supermarkets shelves because of questions over contamination			2
in 1990 , @entity111 had to withdraw millions of bottles worldwide after traces of benzene were found in the water			0
and in 2004 , @entity116 launched @entity117 , which was ‘ purified ’ tap water taken straight from mains supplies			2
