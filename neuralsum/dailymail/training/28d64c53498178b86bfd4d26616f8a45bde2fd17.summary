@entity7 ( pictured ) hanged himself moments after three @entity3 staff turned up at his store to cut off the electricity supply , an inquest heard mr @entity7 was serving customers at his family run mini market ( pictured ) in @entity10 , @entity11 , when the workmen arrived in a convoy of three vehicles with a warrant saying his shop was going to be ' de-energised ' shortly afterwards , as the workmen called police from outside to alert them about mr @entity7 ' claims , he closed the shop and hanged himself			1
today the energy giant was condemned by mr @entity7 ' family after a coroner said he had been ' put on the spot ' by company staff			1
the tragedy occurred in the same month that regulator @entity44 said the big six energy firms - including @entity3 - were set to double profit margins over the next year			2
mr @entity7 ' father @entity48 , 87 , said : ' i think @entity7 felt he had let us down			1
he was pushed to the point of desperation by a big corporation bullying him because it could n't give a bit of leeway to a single man struggling and he was pushed over the edge			0
i think it is disgusting			0
' i 'm sure they could have arranged for another payment scheme if things were getting that bad			0
i do n't understand why @entity3 had to send three men to his shop without any warning			2
' it was a bit heavy - handed and these companies forget the human side of things			0
where is their humanity ? @entity7 ( pictured ) told the gasmen he could raise £ 1,000 but was told this was not enough before his store was plunged into darkness , an inquest heard ' since they switched off the electricity we have had row upon row of stock going to waste and to add insult to injury we 've had two break - ins because the burglar alarm was rendered useless when the electricity was cut off			1
' i know it must have been difficult for those three @entity3 men and they were only doing their job but when @entity7 said the words he did and stated his intention , why did no one take heed ? is money worth as much as a life ? ' the inquest in @entity98 heard a team of three @entity3 employees , including a locksmith and engineer turned up on july 22 in a convoy of three vehicles at mr @entity7 ' mini market			1
warrant officer @entity106 , one of the @entity3 team members , said in a statement : ' we attend residents and businesses who have not paid their bills			2
we either collect the outstanding debt or " de-energise " the electricity supply			0
' i went into the shop and mr @entity7 was serving customers			1
he confirmed he was @entity7			2
i tried to explain why i was there but it was difficult because he was trying to serve customers			2
we began to talk inside the shop			0
mr @entity7 ' father @entity48 , pictured holding one of the @entity3 bills , has hit out at the company after a coronor ruled his son was ' put on the spot ' by company staff ' i explained why we were there - if he did not pay there was a warrant and his supply would be de-energised			1
' i spoke to a lady who had access to the computer and she confirmed that the debt was still outstanding			0
they give the final say on whether we de-energise or walk away			0
she confirmed we had to de-energise if the debt was not paid in full			0
' he began to talk to them and then he handed the phone to me			0
i think he rang a close friend or relative to get money			0
he said he could get about £ 1,000 but i said that was not enough			1
' he clearly felt he should have been given more time to pay			0
he said " you will have to do it , " referring to us de-energising the electricity supply			0
' but he was getting more anxious and said " i will hang myself "			0
i thought it was just a throw away comment , an idle threat			0
in my line of work i hear people say it quite regularly and think nothing of it			0
' mr @entity7 pulled the window shutters down and told staff to go home and told @entity3 to " go ahead			1
" @entity7 , pictured centre with his father @entity164 , left , and mother @entity165 , right , was heard to say ' i will hang myself ' after @entity167 gas staff ' de-energised ' his store mr @entity7 senior had set up @entity170 ( pictured ) in 1969 with a view to leaving it to his son the inquest was told how he was then heard to repeat ' i will hang myself ' before adding ' i have got the rope ready you know			1
i would have been 49 next month			0
' mr @entity106 said : ' again i just thought this was idle threats and trying to make us feel sorry for him so we would not go ahead			2
he kept trying to hurry us up saying " i want you to leave now "			0
' his window shutters were down and the door inside was shut			0
i thought mr @entity7 was still inside but i had n't been able to watch the door while i was on the phone to the police			1
' police arrived and asked the @entity3 locksmith to pick the lock to gain entry			2
officers found mr @entity7 ' body in a warehouse at the back of the store			1
mr @entity7 senior had set up @entity170 in 1969 with a view to leaving it to his son			1
but the family ran into financial difficulties after building a large property portfolio on the back of a £ 300,000 bank loan			2
when @entity7 , who was single , took over this year , three of the businesses they ran had to temporarily shut down in an attempt to consolidate the debts			2
a coroner recorded a verdict of suicide adding that there was evidence mr @entity7 ( pictured ) had been ' put on the spot ' by @entity3 workers the mini market reopened in february but hit difficulties when the bank called in the debts on the family 's other business interests , the inquest heard			1
mr @entity7 said : ' earlier this year we thought we were doing really nicely and that things were on the mend			1
sales were going up , it was great and then suddenly the bank said three of our properties would have to be sold to pay for the others - and that 's when it all started to go wrong			0
' @entity3 were already charging us thousands for the shop even though it had been shut down for a while			2
how they could have accumulated a bill like that when it was closed i do n't know			0
' @entity7 was paying his current @entity3 bill so as far as we were concerned they had come around to collect money for a bill he should n't have been paying			1
' recording a verdict of suicide @entity244 coroner @entity244 said : ' there is considerable evidence in my mind that @entity7 was under a considerable amount of stress with the financial difficulties of the business			1
' there is evidence that he was put on the spot by the @entity3 officers			1
he closed the shop and sent people away			0
@entity7 ( pictured with his mother @entity165 and father @entity48 ) had ' done his best for a long time to keep the family business ' , the coroner said the family of mr @entity7 say vandals targeted the shop in @entity10 , @entity11 , after the power was cut off ' he took himself to the rear of the building where he took his own life			1
there was no evidence that he was suffering from any psychological conditions or that his judgement was impaired by use of alcohol			2
' he was a man who had done his best for a long time to keep the family business which he took great pride in , in good health for as long as he could			0
he realised he could n't do that for any longer and took a view that all that was left was to end his life			2
' after the case @entity286 of @entity3 said , ' we were very saddened by the death of mr @entity7 and we would like to express our sincere sympathies to his family			1
' @entity3 employees followed our established procedures and contacted the police when they were onsite and stayed there until they arrived			1
' @entity296 is always a last resort and this usually follows a series of discussions including payment plans and support from organisations like @entity304 to try and resolve the issue			0
