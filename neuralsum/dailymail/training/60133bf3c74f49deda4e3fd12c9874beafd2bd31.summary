sunday night 's episode of @entity1 saw @entity2 spend a trial night at boarding school - a desperate bid to avoid spending future weekends with her father after catching him with his mistress			1
it was n't just any boarding school though			1
like most details in @entity1 , there is a real - life historical context , and the choice of @entity17 's , the prestigious @entity18 , @entity19 finishing school that today charges $ 48,500 a term for boarders , is no different			1
early in the episode , @entity2 's mother , @entity22 , tells her ex-husband , @entity24 , that it was the school @entity26 had attended			1
escape ? the latest episode of @entity1 saw @entity2 spend a night at @entity17 's boarding school in @entity18 , @entity19 , in a bid to avoid future weekends with her father and the former first lady is not the only famous alumna			1
since it was founded in 1843 , miss @entity17 's has been responsible for the education of leading female academics and socialites alike , including members of the @entity39 and @entity40 families			1
we know that just two decades before @entity2 's fictional visit , a 16 - year - old @entity42 penned love letters to then - boyfriend @entity45 , a student at @entity46 , on miss @entity17 's headed paper			1
showing a degree of teenage melodrama that could just as easily have been part of @entity2 's @entity1 script , she wrote : ' if these are the happiest days of your life , i 'm hanging myself with my skip rope tonight			2
' in another , she tells ' @entity58 ' that when she goes to parties during a school holiday in @entity61 , she 'll ' make the hours that you stay up look like the curfew for a two - year - old ' and that over @entity65 she ' can commute happily between my doting parents until they both get sick of me			1
' prestigious : since it was founded in 1843 , miss @entity17 's has educated leading female academics and socialites alike , including @entity26 and members of the @entity39 and @entity40 families @entity72 education : today , the @entity18 , @entity19 school charges $ 48,500 a term for boarders it seems that @entity42 was regarded as a model student though			1
for years afterwards , former student @entity79 tells @entity80 , she was held up as an example for girls to follow			2
' @entity83 never ceased rubbing our noses in the fact that @entity42 would have gotten it right , that @entity42 would have said that correctly , ' she said			2
' they were very much , in the early 60s , preparing us for life in the 1930s			2
it was a man ’s world ' shedding light on the type of environment @entity2 might have experienced , @entity92 , author of @entity93 , a novel based on @entity17 's , told the magazine 's same 2009 article that ' they were very much , in the early 60s , preparing us for life in the 1930s			2
' it was a man ’s world , ' she wrote			2
' and @entity18 was making it clear to us that we should learn to survive and learn to be our best selves within those strictures			2
' the year @entity2 would have visited , however , the school was going through its own major changes : in 1968 , miss @entity17 's enrolled its first black student , @entity109			1
now a doctor in @entity112 , dr @entity110 tells @entity80 how then - headmaster @entity113 told her that the school was ' taking a chance ' on her			1
@entity117 dreams : just two decades before @entity2 's fictional visit , a 16 - year - old @entity26 penned love letters to her then - boyfriend on miss @entity17 's headed paper names of note : famous alumni also include @entity125 , who graduated from @entity126 's in 1941 ' if i did well they would then believe what they had heard , which was that many people of color may not be good test takers but could be good students , ' she recalled			1
' and so , therefore , i had that burden			2
' fired : former miss @entity17 's teacher @entity136 was accused of having sex with a 17 - year - old student in a classroom closet it would seem that dr @entity110 had a warmer reception than @entity2 , who found that students embraced her - more so , even , than their parents			2
but miss @entity17 's had a tough reputation by all accounts			2
@entity148 and @entity147 , who were headteachers between 1917 and 1943 , apparently forbade students from playing cards , chewing gum , reading popular novels and leaving the school grounds without permission			1
they breakfasted at 7am and were forbidden from touching their hair at mealtimes or crumbling cookies into ice cream			0
and indeed there would be no cookies or ice cream if a girl was deemed overweight			0
there was a ' fat table ' and ' thin table ' at mealtimes for girls who the school felt needed to lose or gain weight , @entity166 actress @entity165 , who graduated in 1955 , says			1
there were also reports of hazing for new girls - and a recent lawsuit accusing the school of allowing ritual bullying to take place			1
in 2008 , former student @entity182 claimed she had a nervous breakdown following harassment from a secret student society of ' @entity186 ' who call themselves the @entity189 after @entity191 's secret police			0
miss @entity182 , who was expelled for cheating on an art history test , claims she was villified by these @entity193 after suggesting that miss @entity17 's students participate in a multi-school prom , and was branded ' retarded ' over her attention deficit disorder			0
unwanted advances : when @entity200 disappears into a room with @entity202 , however , his friend tries to seduce @entity2 with the words : ' i 've been with lots of girls			0
i know what i 'm doing ' a hit with the @entity193 : such drama apparently impresses the @entity17 's girls , as @entity211 later informs @entity2 that she has earned herself glowing reviews former student @entity213 , who graduated from @entity17 's in 1990 , told the @entity214 how the fearsome name came about			0
' we learned about the 16th - century @entity217 @entity189 in @entity220 @entity219 history , ' she said			0
' at the time , as precocious teenagers , it seemed like a clever idea to name ourselves ' because it was ' underground and cryptic			0
' there were other scandals that rocked the school too			1
in 1976 , an apparently overweight student gave birth to a baby boy in a bathroom			0
the situation was only discovered afterwards when the girl began bleeding heavily , and the infant 's body was later found			0
and earlier this year , a former teacher was accused of having sex with a 17 - year - old student in a classroom closet			0
@entity136 , 42 , who taught physics and coached soccer and track since august 2009 , was fired on march 4 and charged with sexual assault following claims that he had been making advances on the girl since she was 15 and had sexually inappropriate conversations and text messages with at least five other students ages 15 to 18			0
regardless of bad press , the school 's alumni , or @entity251 as they are known to each other , remain fiercely loyal to their school			1
@entity255 , who graduated in 1974 , told the @entity214 : ' the traditions are n’t really sinister			0
maybe there ’s nervousness in the beginning , but it ’s a bonding moment			0
' of course , as the @entity1 episode proved , an elite reputation does not prevent mischief - and the antics of @entity2 and her dorm - mates @entity202 and @entity265 were typical of girls at boarding school today			1
in a bid to impress the two existing students with whom she is sharing a room and will cast verdict on her after the stay , @entity2 invites her friend @entity274 , who brings alcohol , marijuana - and a friend - to get a dorm room party started			0
when @entity200 disappears into a room with @entity202 , however , his friend tries to seduce @entity2 with the words : ' i 've been with lots of girls			0
i know what i 'm doing			0
' @entity2 is not won over though , and when he gets pushy , she calls on @entity200 to rescue her , prompting a fist - fight between the two boys before they are made to leave for fear that a teacher will hear them			0
such drama apparently impresses the @entity17 's girls , though , as @entity211 later informs @entity2 that she has earned herself glowing reviews			0
but whether @entity17 's will prove the escape @entity2 so desires remains to be seen			0
clearly both her parents ' daughter , she can hold her own - the desire to run to boarding school , though , may see her thrown from the frying pan into the fire .			1
