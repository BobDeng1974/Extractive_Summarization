when beautician @entity1 set up a fundraising page for @entity3 she hoped to raise a respectable £ 500 to help the disabled pensioner feel safer in his home after he was mugged and left with a broken collarbone as he put the bins out			1
but the 21 - year - old never expected to inspire people from as far afield as @entity10 and @entity11 to donate in their droves so that the money would be enough to buy mr @entity3 a new house			1
as donations exceeded £ 300,000 in just four days people are calling for miss @entity1 herself to be rewarded for her philanthropic attitude			1
a separate fundraising campaign has also been launched for her , which has so far raised £ 500 - despite the mother - of - one insisting she does not want the money			1
police have also renewed their efforts and appealed for information to help find the thug who carried out the ' cowardly ' attack on the pensioner , outside his @entity39 home at about 6.30pm last sunday			1
detective constable @entity40 said the assault had left the 67 - year - old feeling vulnerable , but he had been boosted by the support of people who had donated to help him			1
he said : ' but the main thing for us is to find the person responsible for this cowardly assault against a man unable to defend himself and we need the public 's help			2
' we do not have a description or direction of travel of the offender but someone will know something about the man involved			0
' @entity59 said they had some forensic evidence but little information about the culprit			0
donations to the @entity3 fund , through website gofundme , tipped £ 300,000 this afternoon and pledges are still being made almost every minute			1
mr @entity3 plans to use the money raised by miss @entity1 's fundraising page to buy himself a new house @entity71 , of @entity72 , has launched the fundraising page for 21 - year - old miss @entity1			1

all funds will be handed to @entity1 via @entity83 in order for her to spend as she wishes			0
' wellwishers left comments on the new funding page , showing their support for miss @entity1			1
thousands of people from across the globe have donated and in four days the fund has exceeded £ 300,000 mr @entity3 said the selfless act by @entity93 and other people who had donated had restored his faith @entity96 said : ' @entity1 , you will go far in life with your selfless attitude			1
you 've become something of a celebrity , and the @entity3 fund is gon na be something in your cv that people will always remember you for			0
' in your wildest dreams , you could never have imagined last week , that by now you 'd have raised enough to buy @entity3 a home outright ! true serendipity , and a story that 's taken the world by it 's heartstrings			2

' under the @entity138 rules , miss @entity1 and mr @entity3 can request access to the funds which have been donated at any time , and it will be paid to them within a week			1
some supporters have called for the website to waive its five per cent fee on the donations - set to add up to at least £ 14,000			1
miss @entity1 and mr @entity3 have spoken of their amazement at the reaction to the fundraising appeal however the organisation said it would not be able to waive its fees in this case			1
a spokeswoman said : ' as you might imagine , we receive many requests to waive fees , along with other concessions			0
in order to be fair , if we waive fees for one cause , we 're obligated to also waive fees for others			0
' unfortunately , if we began waiving fees on a regular basis , there would be no way for us to build and maintain the website			0
simply put , there would be no @entity138			0
' our hearts go out to @entity3 and his family during this difficult time			0
the campaign set up for @entity3 is a shining example of what can happen when @entity138 is used to its full potential			2
the campaign has been shared on @entity114 a staggering 25,000 times , and on @entity175 nearly 3,000 times			0
' as donations tipped £ 300,000 miss @entity1 said she was pleased so many people had donated to help mr @entity3 but said she felt she did not deserve any recognition or fundraising for herself			1
' this is so incredibly kind but i really ca n't accept anything , ' she said			0
' i have my full life to work and i ca n't help but feel that there are people out there who would really need it			0
i 'm not in any hurry to get married too but honestly i do n't deserve this			0
