by @entity0 @entity1 is threatening to pull out of the biggest fight in this country ’s boxing history if any @entity6 officials are appointed for his re-match with @entity8			1
that ultimatum ignited the first war of words between these two sworn enemies , even as the first tranche of 60,000 @entity15 tickets sold out within an hour of going online			1
that verbal exchange was followed by a shoving match as the pair posed for photographs at the @entity20 , with @entity8 pushing @entity1 in the chest			1
video : scroll down to watch the press conference no love lost : @entity8 and @entity1 pose for the cameras on the side of the @entity15 pitch look into my eyes : @entity8 refuses to make eye contact with @entity1 up close : @entity8 pushes @entity1 on the side of the @entity15 pitch getting physical : @entity8 shoves @entity1 away during the pitch side photo call push off : @entity8 shoves @entity1 during the stare down stand off : @entity8 and @entity1 argue as tempers flare up step away : @entity8 and @entity1 are separated after a minor altercation and the fight is still two months away			1
@entity8 took patriotic exception to @entity1 demanding that the referee and all three judges on may 31 are foreigners			1
the financial stakes are astonishingly high			0
what is now certain to become the first 80,000 boxing crowd on home soil will , alone , generate £ 6million			0
@entity44 are projecting one million pay - per - view buys , potentially worth £ 17m			0
even if the tv audience falls short of that prediction , broadcasting rights in the @entity49 and another 100 countries world - wide will ensure that @entity51 breaks the £ 20m barrier			0
then , as promoter @entity53 was able to joke as 1,000 internet ticket sales per minute justified his gamble of committing to @entity15 even though @entity56 play a @entity58 match at the @entity20 the night before : ‘ we also have the ice cream sales			1
’ what the world is waiting for : @entity8 and @entity1 pose infront of the cameras after their press conference [ caption yet @entity1 insists he is prepared to walk away from his first seven - figure pay night - @entity8 as champion gets the lion ’s share of at least £ 5m - if his demands are not met			1
he says : ‘ one @entity6 official , no ring walk			2
unless the ref and the judges are from abroad the fight wo n’t happen			2
’ @entity1 has inserted a clause to that effect into his contract but @entity8 counters : ‘ this is a huge @entity6 fight and it makes a mockery of our @entity79 to ask them to sanction the fight but not invite them to the party			1
’ the first clash ended in that controversy of a premature ninth round stoppage by top @entity6 referee @entity89 in favour of @entity8 , even though @entity1 was ahead on the scorecards after inflicting a shock round - one knock down			1
@entity1 argues now : ‘ given the long , heated build up for this second fight i want neutral officials who do n’t live here so wo n’t be affected , either consciously or subconsciously , by all the hype on tv and in the press			1
’ mind games : @entity1 plays with a @entity101 while @entity8 speaks to the press matchmaker : promoter @entity53 poses with both boxers says @entity8 : ‘ @entity1 is just worried about a backlash from @entity6 judges after the way he has hung @entity89 out to dry following the first fight			1
but it ’s not right			0
i have complete respect for the @entity111 and we have some of the finest , most knowledgeable referees and judges in the world			2
although the stoppage was early @entity89 made an honest decision to protect @entity1 when i had him in trouble			2
in @entity49 , the referees tend to let fighters keep taking so much punishment that it becomes up to the corners to throw in the towel			2
’ the @entity124 , whose world super-middleweight title is the principle championship on the line , have been asked provisionally by the @entity129 to include at least one @entity6 judge			2
at a meeting last week , @entity53 asked if they would settle for the appointment of a @entity6 supervisor , probably @entity79 general secretary @entity135 who is on the roster of @entity124 officials			2
@entity53 adds : ‘ it ’s situation we have to resolve in the coming weeks , as @entity1 does have this condition in his contract			2
but i ca n’t believe he would pull out of a fight of the magnitude even if the @entity79 took absolute exception			0
’ record breakers : tickets for @entity147 sold out in an hour not playing the game : @entity8 refuses to look @entity1 in the eye after their press conference @entity8 doubts it , too			1
although @entity1 may be less willing to compromise after @entity8 levered him away with two hands to the chest at this , their first head - to - head meeting since their november collision in november – after @entity8 ’s brother @entity159 loudly challenged him to an impromptu scrap			1
the latter incident took place during the media launch of the event , at @entity15 , and of itself was laughed off by @entity1			1
the confrontation between the two boxers themselves came after @entity8 had refused to engage with @entity1 in the traditional stare - down for publicity pictures and then declined the proffered handshake , although he did say : ‘ thank you , @entity1			1
’ both men had presented themselves initially as more calm , composed and respectful than in the build - up to their first fight			0
then came the difference of opinion about the officials , as well as barbs about @entity1 having played with a @entity101 while @entity8 was addressing the tv cameras			1
@entity1 jibed : ‘ @entity8 is such a simple puzzle to solve			1
i wanted a harder one			0
’ @entity8 reacted : ‘ i bet he did n’t work it out			2
in one email he spelled pretence as pretense			0
’ know your enemy : @entity1 talks to one of @entity8 's entourage each denied hating the other , although the animosity clearly lingers on			1
@entity1 said he would not want to spend time in room with his rival unless he had to			2
@entity8 waved hand under his challenger ’s nose by way of repeating his familiar claim that @entity1 has bad breath			1
so while the physical brush was more handbags than harmful , it was not a publicity stunt.not that this event needs one			0
as those 60,000 tickets flew out over the ether , @entity53 was seeking talks with the @entity212 to gain their approval for the sale of another 20,000 seats			1
he may have to agree to bring the timing of the first bell forward , to the irritation of some overseas broadcasters , in the interests of safety as the crowd go home at night			0
if so , it would be a small price to pay for breaking the live gate record of 70,000 set by @entity227 and @entity228 back in the mists of time			0
the highest attendances claimed by @entity15 are some 50,000 each for @entity232 versus @entity233 and @entity234 versus @entity235			2
the biggest turn out hitherto this century is 56,000 for @entity238 ’s fight with @entity239 at his beloved @entity241 ’s ground in 2008 – and that record has gone already			0
fingers crossed : @entity1 is hoping for a different outcome in the re-match all smiles : @entity8 looks relaxed at the press conference on one point the two boxers did agree			1
both are hugely excited by being at the centre of such a momentous occasion			0
@entity1 said : ‘ everything happens for a reason , even that stonewall robbery in @entity256 which has made this happen			0
i ’m doubly thrilled because its in my home city			0
that ’s one round to me			0
’ @entity8 said : ‘ this is the national stadium , not anyone ’s local football ground			0
i feel humbled to be part of this			0
i ’m going to enjoy this , and so should everyone else			0
’ of course , each thinks he will win			0
@entity1 said : ‘ @entity8 has been forced into taking a fight he did n’t want and after how badly i hurt him first time he knows he ca n’t win			1
if i decide to go for him early this will be like the old @entity272 classic , all over in three fantastic rounds			0
’ @entity8 said : ‘ i had a bad night at the office in @entity256 while @entity1 was the best he can ever be – but i still won			1
there will be no arguments after i knock him out here			0
’ the hype goes on .			0

tickets sell out in just one hour , talks taking place to sell a further 20,000
@entity8 v @entity285 re-match set to be the biggest *post-war* fight held in @entity6
