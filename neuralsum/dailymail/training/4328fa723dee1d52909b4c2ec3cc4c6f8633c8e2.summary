tax experts said the @entity15 estate would have hired appraisers to determine how much his assets were worth at the time of his death , including his likeness			0
however , with few estates valuable enough to have to file with the @entity3 , @entity15 's worth is generally hard to measure			2
' this is something unusual , ' @entity99 , an estate tax expert at the law firm @entity101 , told the @entity12			0
' he was one of the premier entertainers of our time			0
so there are really no comparables , and it leaves the valuation question open to a huge range of possibilities			0

the tax court documents show that @entity15 had three @entity151 and a 2001 @entity119 that the @entity3 said were worth $ 250,000 , not the $ 91,600 the estate placed on them			1
