two musicians have staged a creative - and virtual - protest against @entity2 after they were banned from boarding a commuter flight with their instruments			1
@entity5 and @entity6 were outraged when they were told that they could not bring their violins on board with them on @entity9			1
when they were refused entry to the plane in @entity15 , @entity16 because the flight crew would not let them carry the instruments on board , mr @entity10 started playing his violin furiously on the tarmac			1
@entity40 ! ' mr @entity5 wrote in the @entity42 video caption			0
' are violins dangerous ? it 's hard enough to make it as a classical musician			2
cut us some slack , please ! ! ! ' the @entity48 spoke to representatives from the airline who portray the situation slightly differently			0
they said that while it is company policy to allow instruments on as either carry on luggage or checked baggage , that is left up to the flight crew 's discretion			1
in this case , the flight attendants apparently felt that there was not enough room in the cabin to fit the instruments , but that was not a sufficient explanation for the musicians			1
on their way : @entity5 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) were connecting in @entity15 for a flight to @entity73 where they would meet their third bandmate in order to perform in a music festival verbalizing their problems : the band updated their followers on @entity82 after being rebooked to a second flight ' i used to think that captains knew about art but i guess not , ' mr @entity10 says in the video			1
' @entity89 would be very upset			0
' the duo was on their way to @entity73 , @entity93 to meet their third band member in order to play at the @entity97			2
after complaining on @entity82 and being rebooked on a second flight , the two men were able to get to their final destination			2
the frustration did n't end when they boarded the second flight , however , since they thought it was the same sized plane as the first			0
the video has been viewed more than 22,000 times since it was uploaded on monday			0
it appears as if the internet is on their side , since more than 1,000 viewers liked the video while only 87 have disliked it .			0

@entity2 says that it is up to the flight attendants discretion whether instruments can be brought on board
