it was previously believed that ‘ @entity6 ’ and ‘ @entity7 ’ - the most recent common ancestors to males and females - lived at completely different times			1
but a new study of 69 men from around the world found ‘ @entity6 ’ walked the @entity14 between 120,000 and 156,000 years ago , much earlier than previously believed			1

but the researchers say it is ‘ extremely unlikely ’ they were exact contemporaries			1
initial estimates for the male @entity28 ranged from between 50,000 to 115,000 years ago			1
geneticist professor @entity29 , of @entity30 , @entity31 , said : ' previous research has indicated the male most recent common ancestor ( @entity28 ) lived much more recently than the female @entity28			0
but now our research shows there is no discrepancy			0
' @entity7 and @entity6 are the two individuals who passed down a portion of their genomes to the vast expanse of humanity			1
but many aspects of their existence , including when they lived , are shrouded in mystery			0
the researchers compared y - chromosome variations among participants from nine globally distinct areas , including some that have only recently been available , such as @entity54 , the @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			2

the annual mutation rate was then estimated by comparing it with a known event , the human settlement of the @entity78 about 15,000 years ago but despite the @entity2 monikers , which evoke a single couple whose children peopled the world , they were not the only man and woman alive at the time , or the only ones to have present day descendants			1
they simply had the good fortune to successfully pass on the y chromosome and the mitochondrial genome across thousands of years to most of us			2
powerful , state of the art microscopes allowed the identification of about 11,000 mutations , enabling the researchers to establish genetic links and timelines with unprecedented accuracy			2

but it is also possible it represents a time when only a few sequences were passed on and many died out due to an external event that has not yet been identified they repeated the analysis with the individuals ’ mitochondrial dna to generate the two estimates for @entity2 , showing for the first time they overlap			2
professor @entity29 said : ‘ we can now date certain events very precisely			0
we found a single variant that shows how three ancient lineages came together about 48,000 years ago , plus or minus only a couple of hundred years			1

‘ for the most part , it is a random process			0
some lineages die out , some are successful , ’ said @entity136 , a graduate student in prof @entity29 ’s lab. ‘ but it is also possible there may be elements of human demographic history that predispose these lineages to coalesce at certain times			2

' @entity6 ’ is thought to have walked the @entity14 between 120,000 and 156,000 years ago
this places him nearer to eve who was around 99,000 to 148,000 years ago
