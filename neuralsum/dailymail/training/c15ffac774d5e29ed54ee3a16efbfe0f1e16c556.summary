@entity0 celebrated his 63rd birthday on friday			0
next weekend , the next chapter in his life begins in earnest when @entity5 play @entity6 in the first @entity8 game under his charge			1
relatively elderly managers have n’t always fared well when working in @entity11 for the first time			1
@entity13 did n’t have the patience or inclination to learn @entity16 properly after a career in @entity18 and @entity19			1
@entity20 used a chauffeur to ferry him about because he felt he was too old to learn how to drive on the left			2
video : scroll down to see footage of @entity5 signings @entity25 and @entity27 getting his message across : @entity0 is confident of success at @entity5 after taking over this summer jubilant : the 63 - year - old says he will be active as @entity5 boss , and will drive himself to work , despite his age @entity36 wants reinforcements @entity36 insists he wo n’t be a fossil			1
‘ i ’ll drive myself to the training ground , ’ he promises			0
‘ i have already driven in @entity11 , in 1996 in a brand new @entity40			2
‘ i was invited by the @entity42 president and i drove myself			0
it ’s an easy job ! it is only a problem when it is late and there are no other cars there , otherwise you can just follow the car in front of you			0
‘ i think i ’ll be able to adapt though i ’ll only know for certain when the @entity8 begins			2
football is football everywhere and , i ’m sorry , but i have survived			0
’ for all the warnings about @entity36 being authoritarian and demanding , he cuts an affable and relaxed figure as he sits down with the @entity57 ahead of the big kick off			1
he likes to intersperse his pantomime glares with plenty of smiles and laughter			0
back to winning ways : @entity5 claimed the @entity64 on their pre-season tour of the @entity66 undoubtedly , he ’s had an intense start to life at @entity70			1
delayed by @entity72 ’s run to the @entity74 semi-finals , he ’s been in his new job just three weeks and travelled nearly 15,000 miles in that time			2
a positive omen is the club have already won two trophies under his leadership ; the @entity64 by beating @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 in @entity66 , and the @entity84 , in which 18 - year - old striker @entity85 scored four goals in the final against @entity88			2
only two new players have arrived so far , @entity27 and @entity25 but @entity36 does n’t gloss over the fact that the team , who finished seventh last year under @entity93 , are short in certain areas			1
@entity27 who 's talking : @entity27 admits it will be a dream come to true to make his @entity70 debut new signing : @entity25 ( centre ) was overwhelmed by @entity5 's support in the @entity100 interestingly , he does little to dampen speculation that he ’d be interested in securing @entity82 ’s £ 55million winger @entity102 and £ 15million @entity105 wing - back @entity103 , particularly after @entity106 secured the signing of @entity109 defender @entity108			1
@entity80 ’s @entity110 is a january target			2
‘ you can not compare players how the players will do under the guidance of @entity93 with those same players under the guidance of @entity0			0
every trainer and coach and manager wants a different style of play and different tactics , ’ he outlines			2
‘ now we have five number 9s and four number 10s and we do n’t have wingers to play attacking width , not at the highest level , of @entity130 or @entity102 or something like that			1
so i have to play also in another way and you have seen that			0
’ ‘ it ’s a strategy of @entity5 to buy players who are on the way up and getting better , but i only buy when i think we need to			1
’ @entity139 : @entity36 says @entity5 do not possess wingers as good as @entity82 's @entity102 physical challenge : @entity103 admitted that he would prefer @entity142 to @entity11 , despite @entity36 's interest in him he acknowledges that could include one or two from the group of players he worked with as @entity72 manager			1
‘ if they are at the level i want them to be , then i will sign @entity153 players , ’ he states			1
‘ @entity153 players are usually cheaper than players of other nationalities and they have usually been very well educated in the @entity153 , i believe			1
‘ but they have to be of a level than can play well in the @entity8			1
you have to ask yourself if that is the case with every player			0
’ much has been made of @entity36 ’s success in the past with young players , something in line with the @entity5 philosophy dating back to the @entity166 and continued by sir @entity167			1
@entity36 won the @entity168 with @entity105 when @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 were emerging			2
at @entity106 , he gave @entity174 and @entity175 their big break			0
lean on me : the @entity5 boss says he will look to his assistant manager @entity179 for support this season he ’d like to do the same at @entity5 and will lean on assistant - manager @entity179 on who deserves a chance			1
but he is also keen to stress the players have to be good enough as well as young enough			2
‘ @entity179 is my assistant manager because i always want someone on my staff who knows and understands the culture of the club , ’ adds @entity36 , whose methods have won trophies in their bucketload at @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity187 and @entity188			1
‘ @entity179 has mentioned some players to me and i have seen some of them play in the matches			1
‘ i have one rule for young players ; to get in my team they have to be better than the player they are replacing			2
‘ it is n't tough for me to put young players into my team			0
when they are better , they play			0
for me , age is not important and experience is not important			0
it is the ability of the player that is the important thing			0
’ the likes of @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 , and @entity85 will wait with baited breath to see if their chance comes this season or if a loan period elsewhere is required first			0
impressed : @entity153 praises @entity220 but insists physical training will carry on until first league game the partnership of @entity220 and @entity224 is one that neither sir @entity167 nor @entity93 got to grips with properly			1
@entity36 knows @entity226 personally and with the @entity153 absent so far after a @entity228 break , has got to see @entity220 close hand			1
before , @entity220 has been a threat to @entity36 ’s teams , particularly in 2010 when @entity187 played @entity5 in the @entity168 semi-final			1
‘ i liked him when i was the manager of his opponent , ’ said @entity36			2
‘ he is always working very hard , has a high level and can make goals			0
he did that in @entity66 , four goal in his first three matches is not so bad i think ! ‘ but we have to wait and see , we are now in the beginning of the preparation			0
the physical training will go on before our first league match			0
’ the hidden warning to @entity220 could have come out of @entity167 ’s mouth			1
the legendary @entity5 boss was occasionally irritated by the player ’s fluctuating physical condition			1
good luck : @entity36 says former @entity5 boss sir @entity167 has wished him all the best ahead of season @entity167 wo n’t be a overbearing presence to @entity36 as he was to @entity93			1
the @entity153 says he will pick the @entity256 ’s brains over coffee or dinner at some stage , but their initial communication has been brief and to the point			2
‘ he just wished me luck and that was it			0
it is n’t disappointing , it is normal			0
i did the same when i was in the same position as him			0
@entity167 was the consummate man - manager , getting good players to feel right about themselves and perform on the pitch			1
@entity93 liked the coaching side of the game			0
@entity36 ’s strength is he can do both			2
a natural people person who nonetheless thinks a manager can orchestrate success through tactics			0
‘ @entity278 did n’t teach us anything new			0
every system has been tried before in football			0
it ’s how you prepare your team to do against the system of the opponents , that is the thing that always makes the difference			0

@entity36 said he is impressed by @entity220 but issued a *veiled* warning about player 's physical condition ahead of the start of the @entity8
@entity5 boss admitted he does not have wingers of the *calibre* of @entity130 and long - term target @entity102
@entity36 also said he would not *shy* away from signing @entity153 players , as long as they are good enough to play at @entity70
@entity153 coach is *adamant* he will be a success at @entity5 despite elderly managers like @entity13 and @entity20 *struggling* in @entity11
former @entity72 boss says he will lean on assistant @entity179 for support
