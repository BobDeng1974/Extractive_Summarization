@entity0 not only faked his own death but had also been claiming pensions relating to his late father - in - law from a previous marriage fraudster @entity0 had everything in place to pocket a hefty £ 520,000 life insurance pay - out			1
after faking his own death the pensioner impersonated his wife and claimed he had been knocked down and killed by a cabbage lorry in @entity11			1
but , unlike canoe man @entity12 , who fooled insurers into making a payout , @entity0 did n’t get a penny			1
his suspicious insurance company contacted the police – who found the conman ’s fingerprints on his own bogus death certificate			2
the twice - married former insurance salesman was jailed for six years yesterday after admitting fraud and stealing £ 68,000 by claiming two pensions in the name of his late father - in - law			1
@entity28 , 66 , who has convictions dating back to 1963 , judge @entity27 told him the ' deliberate and calculated fraud ’ had been carried out ' to gratify your overweening greed ’			1
his case at @entity34 bears striking similarities to that of @entity12 who faked his demise with wife @entity38 in a £ 680,000 insurance swindle before fleeing to @entity40			1
he and his wife were jailed in 2008 after he reappeared claiming to have lost his memory			1
@entity0 ’s bogus claim was made to @entity44 - based @entity43 in the name of father - of - two @entity0 ’s @entity11 wife @entity47			1
the fake witness statement , from a man named @entity50 , recounted the tragic account of how @entity0 was killed in december 2009			2
he was , apparently , knocked over as he tried to change a tyre on his vehicle during a wildlife photography trip in @entity11			0
the fake death certificate on which , in a complete giveaway , insurers found @entity0 's own fingerprints the ' witness ’ described how farm workers transported @entity0 to a small village where local people ' took care of the body ’			2
the following month insurers received documents , reputedly from @entity0 ’s wife , which included a death certificate , police report into the crash and a claim form for the conman ’s accidental death policy			1
at an earlier hearing at @entity34 prosecutor @entity76 said : ' the company expressed some suspicions about the claim			2
’ detectives found @entity0 ’s fingerprints on the bogus death certificate and matched them to prints already held			0
the conman had served three and a half years behind bars in 1975 for robbery			0
he was arrested and during police interviews said he ' did n’t want to be destitute in old age ’ , claiming he got into £ 150,000 worth of debts while looking after his terminally ill first wife			0
he said his second wife had no knowledge of the scam and that he had obtained the documents by bribing officials in @entity11			0
after being charged with fraud earlier this year @entity0 was freed on strict bail conditions banning him from trying to leave the @entity98			0
but the day after his release from custody last march he applied for a new passport claiming he had lost his last one – which had been seized by police			0

hideout : @entity107 's home in @entity108 where he tried to hide away with his wife after his ' death ' @entity0 claimed that he had been killed by a cabbage lorry in @entity11 lies : the ' witness statement ' for @entity0 's scam @entity0 , of @entity108 , @entity115 , also admitted claiming pensions relating to his late father - in - law from his previous marriage , who died in 2007			1
the conman ’s grown - up son and daughter from his previous marriage only learnt of his scam when he was arrested			0

@entity128 there said his first wife @entity129 died of cancer and he married @entity131 , who was ten years younger than him			2
in 2009 they moved to @entity11 , where she is still believed to be living			0
she was not treated as a suspect in the case			0
echoes : the case bears similarities to that of back - from - the - dead @entity12 , right , who faked his own death in a canoe accident off @entity142 in 2002 to help him and his wife @entity38 , left , claim insurance and pension cash			1

jailed for six years for ' deliberate and calculated ' fraud
he impersonated his wife to claim he was killed by a lorry carrying cabbages
similarities to @entity12 who faked his own death in a canoe accident
