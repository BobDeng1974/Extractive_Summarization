by @entity0 published : 18:57 est , 7 december 2013 updated : 19:01 est , 7 december 2013 reunited : @entity1 went her whole life believing that her mother abandoned her at an orphanage when she was a child , but learned the other side of the story when her mother requested to be her friend on @entity9 last month @entity1 got the ultimate early @entity11 gift this year when she reconnected with her mother on @entity9			1
the 44 - year - old @entity14 woman was born in @entity15 where she was raised by her father , @entity16 , who told her that her mother abandoned her as a child			1
but @entity1 learned the other side of the story when a woman named @entity20 from @entity21 asked to be her friend on @entity9 , a week before @entity22			1
like most people , @entity1 ignored the friend request at first , but then @entity20 sent her a message she could n't ignore			1
' she said she was my mother			0
i was shocked because my mother had abandoned me when i was a baby , ' @entity1 told @entity27			1
@entity1 was suspicious at first , but was soon convinced when @entity20 sent her daughter 's birth certificate and pictures of her as a child , answering questions only her mother would know			1
that 's when the two started a conversation that would lead @entity1 to learn the truth about her upbringing			2
for years , @entity1 believed the story that her father told her : that when her mother gained full custody , she dropped her off at an orphanage			1
' later my father took me in , and although he was an alcoholic and mentally and physically abusive , he was the only parent i knew , ' she said			0
confirmed : @entity20 proved she was @entity1 's mother with a birth certificate and several family photos like the one above @entity20 says she did get full custody , because @entity16 was physically abusive but that she never willingly gave up her daughter			1
' one day , under the guise of taking me to a doctor appointment - because my mother could n't afford it - he took me and never came back , ' @entity1 told @entity52			2
@entity20 told her daughter that he kidnapped her because his parents refused to financially support him unless he had custody of his daughter			2
while @entity20 tried to get her daughter back , she had a hard time tracking her ex-husband down since he moved so often			0
according to @entity1 , she and her dad moved 12 times in 18 years			1
' what he was telling us was he was a traveling salesman , so we would have to move from area to area to get new clients and so on , ' @entity1 told @entity67 6 , ' when in all actuality he was wanted by the @entity15 government			2
' first time : @entity67 's @entity70 set up a @entity72 meeting between mother and daughter , marking the first time they 've seen each other face to face seeing her daughter : @entity20 , calling from @entity21 , was clearly choked up in the call			1
@entity1 is currently fundraising to buy a ticket for her mom to visit the @entity82 while living with her father in @entity84 , @entity1 had contact with her mother just once - on her sixteenth birthday			1
' a family member said my aunt was on the phone so i picked up and it was my mom , ' she rememebrs			0
' she started to explain but i hung up on her , angry that she had abandoned me			0
' @entity1 soon left her father to go to attend school in @entity96 at age 18 and never went back			2
the last she heard , he died a few years ago			0
now knowing the true reason behind her mother 's separation , @entity1 is working on organizing a face to face meeting			1
she has set up a fundraising campaign on @entity103 , hoping to get 4,000 dollars to bring her mother to the @entity82 for a visit			2
as of saturday evening , the campaign had raised 3,310 of the goal			0
' there 's so much catching up to do and so much that needs to be filled in			0
until last friday [ nov. 15 ] , i had no family			0
now i have a mother â€¦ a big extended family			0
i do n't know how to explain it			0
it just makes for a nice holiday , ' @entity1 said .			0
