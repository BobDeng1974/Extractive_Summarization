' but after about a year i felt well enough to start going out and meeting new people			0

' the couple got engaged in january 2013 in @entity37			0
mr @entity5 ( pictured as a baby ) said : ' i ca n't believe how lucky i was to not only get my lung transplant , but then to go on to meet the woman of my dream ' mr @entity5 ( pictured as a child ) said : ' without the transplant i almost certainly would n't have survived and gone on to meet @entity13 ' project manager @entity81 said : ' @entity5 did everything properly - he asked my parents two days before we went away and took the ring with us			1

' cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus			1
symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough , recurring chest infections and failure to thrive			0
as the condition develops , a lung transplant may be required			0
there is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long - term damage caused by infections			1
the most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs , and antibiotics to treat infections			0
the condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build - up of mucus			0
for a child to inherit the condition , both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene			0
in this situation , there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes , a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer , and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition			0
about one in every 2,500 babies born in the @entity190 are born with cystic fibrosis			1
as treatments have improved , the outlook for these children has improved dramatically			0
but , life expectancy remains in the 40s			0

@entity5 , 34 , was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at 18 months old
his health slowly deteriorated until he was housebound
he also needed help *breathing* and used a wheelchair to get around
he believes he was close to death when told he could have a transplant
since the operation , he has met and married his partner , @entity13
