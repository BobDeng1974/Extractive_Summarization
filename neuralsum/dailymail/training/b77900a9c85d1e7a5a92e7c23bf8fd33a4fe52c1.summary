by @entity1 reporter an anonymous @entity3 account which enraged parents in @entity5 , @entity6 , after it started posting incriminating photos of drunken teenagers in uncompromising positions has been suspended			1
the account , @ @entity10 , had encouraged teens to send in photos taken at house parties which typically consisted of kids misbehaving by drinking alcohol , throwing up , fighting , posing naked or lying passed out			1
the parents of @entity19 and @entity21 counties were outraged last week when they learned of the account , which quickly amassed more than 25,000 followers			1
' kids do stupid things			0
we 've probably all done stupid things , now you 've got social media to be able to publish to the world how dumb you are forever , ' @entity50 parent @entity49 had told @entity55 @entity6 when the account first gained public attention last week			1
images posted to the account ran the gamut from a fairly innocuous shot of two girls shotgunning beers to students stripping for no apparent reason			1
since teens have been underage drinking since the dawn of time , the resulting images are pretty unsurprising			1
other posts included several students peeing in unconventional places like a sink or the corner of a dining room			0
drunk stories : some of the pictures were fairly innocuous , like the girls on the left shotgunning beers , or the picture on the right of two boys showing up to the party with a cheetah statue sick : but others were more concerning , like the several shots of high schoolers throwing up			2
this girl made it into a waste bin - many did n't when you got ta go , you got ta go : many of the high - schoolers did n't have the patience to wait for an empty bathroom when the photographed teens had had too much to drink , they usually ended up either throwing up ( sometimes successfully making it to the toilet , and many times not ) , or passing out			2
those that made the mistake of falling asleep before everyone else , were usually subjected to such pranks as being surrounded by beer bottles or drawn on with a pen			0
in addition to concerns about the teens ' health , local parents were also concerned that the pictures could come back to haunt their children when they apply for colleges or for jobs			1
tired : when the teens had had too much to drink , they usually passed out before finding a bed do n't move ! this teen is in for a surprise when he awakes from his drunken nap should n't have gone to sleep : the girl who passed out in this photo had crude images scrawled on her face and arm including the phrase ' this is what friends are for ' @entity133 works for @entity134 , a nonprofit organization that educates teens about the dangers of drinking and driving			0
' once it ’s out in cyberspace there ’s no taking it back , ' she told @entity55			0
' if an employer is going to be looking for someone to represent their company you ’re not going to want somebody that ’s been all over the web			0
' before bowing to pressure to suspend the account , the owner had maintained that all they were doing was giving people ' a good laugh			2
' ' listen , we simply made this page for something kids can look at and have a good laugh , ' the unknown account owner had previously told the @entity162			0
' the pictures we post are pictures we are being sent			0

the person behind @ @entity10 has bowed to pressure from parents and the media and suspended the *controversial* @entity3 account
parents raised concerns last week about the incriminating party pictures being posted online
local teens had been sending in pictures taken at underage parties and the account was retweeting the snaps to its more than 25,000 followers
