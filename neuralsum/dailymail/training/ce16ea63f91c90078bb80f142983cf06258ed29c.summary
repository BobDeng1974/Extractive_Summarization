by @entity1 reporter the @entity2 , one of the seven wonders of the natural world , is facing the most serious threats to its existence since it became a @entity9 park 95 years ago as nascent developments jostle over its dwindling water supplies			1
the menace is two-fold , say @entity14 officials , and both would alter the park 's vistas and jeopardize its fragile ecology and water supply			1
the most immediate comes from the east on the floor of the canyon , where few visitors ever venture			2
the @entity25 wants to change that by making the area more accessible to tourists			2
the group has proposed a @entity31 gondola to ferry people from planned hotels and restaurants on its reservation abutting the park along the @entity37 to the point where it intersects with the @entity37			1
visitors paddle whitewater rafts and kayaks along the @entity37 surrounded by the steep walls of the @entity2 in 2013			0
several planned developments threaten to alter the canyon 's natural vistas and jeopardize its water supply the @entity37 , seen here winding through the canyon from @entity49 , is said to be at risk from the planned developments			1
a proposed gondola ride would ferry tourists from the @entity25 to the east to this area to give tourists rare access to the canyon floor this is the view from the @entity2 of the park , the point where most of the 5 million annual visitors enjoy the magnificent view and snap photos for their scrapbooks this image released by @entity67 shows a proposed @entity69 cultural center in @entity70 , a tiny @entity71 town on the road to the @entity2 's @entity2 the native americans contend that they have rights to the property above the high - water mark of both rivers , the @entity73 reports			1
the @entity14 says that the proposal would disrupt the natural beauty of the canyon and creep in on its boundaries			1
the other threat comes from the south , where a tiny two - block town recently approved a major housing and commercial development that would put significant pressure on the ecology and water supply of the arid @entity2 plateau			1
@entity70 , population 555 , wants to build 2,200 houses and 3 million square feet of commercial space			1
they are serious threats to the future of the park , ' park superintendent			0
' when you have that size and scope of potential development that close to the park , it will impact our visitor experience			2
' a bus ferries tourists to @entity110 from @entity70 , a small community that serves as the main gateway to the park tourists board the train in @entity116 to the @entity2 of the @entity2			1
more than five million people visit the park every year the @entity2 , carved out over the eons by rushing river water , began to form 17 million years ago , making it nearly three times older than previously thought , scientists said in 2008			1
the canyon is 277 miles long , 18 miles wide and represents two billion years of the @entity125 's geological history			2
@entity126 of @entity127 was the first @entity128 known to have visited the canyon in 1540 , and it became a @entity131 in 1979			0
more than five million tourists visit the @entity2 every year , making it one of the most popular destinations in the @entity9			0
most of them go only so far as the @entity2 to take in - and digitally chronicle - the seemingly endless expanse of receding canyons and rock walls that descend down to the @entity37 a mile below			0
only the most tenacious and experienced of hikers ever take the long , meandering path to the canyon floor			1
park managers have struggled to preserve the @entity2 natural vista for years , but the developments are testing their limits in their push to give tourists easier access to the rivers and make a bundle of cash in the process			1
the @entity69 tribes around the park have already in recent years been pursuing developments to cash in on more of the canyon 's tourism dollars			1
@entity161 , on land owned by the @entity160 tribe , runs the @entity163 attraction , a glass walkway that juts out past the cliff walls			0
since 2007 , it has also given helicopter tours that land on tribal property next to the river			0
tourists walk along the @entity161 overlooking the @entity2 on the @entity160 near @entity172 in 2011 this artist rendering depicts the @entity25 's proposed aerial tramway that would ferry tourists from the cliff tops of the east rim of the @entity2 to the water 's edge of the @entity37 and @entity180 below the @entity25 's planned gondola would give more visitors that rare opportunity to see the canyon floor , developer @entity185 , who is working with the tribe , told @entity99			1
the park service offers nothing more than ' a drive - by wilderness experience ' , @entity185 said			0
' the average person ca n't ride a mule to the bottom of the canyon			0
we want them to feel the canyon from the bottom			0
' but park officials say the @entity200 's claims to the land by the river are mistaken			2
they say the federal government owns all the land a quarter - mile on either side of the @entity37 , and development is n't allowed within that area			0
the @entity25 still must officially approve the plan , and some within the tribe oppose it for spiritual reasons			2
they believe the two rivers represent male and female , and life begins at their confluence			0
the bigger threat is the development planned two miles from the canyon 's front entrance because of how it would diminish the small amount of water found naturally on the plateau			1
tourists enjoy sunset at @entity225 on the @entity2			0
if development plans go through , they may soon also have a view of a hive of construction workers building restaurants , hotels and shops the town of @entity70 has approved a plan that would increase its demand for water fourfold , the @entity73 reported , without detailing where it would all come from			1
@entity71 is currently suffering its worst drought in at least 110 years , leaving not enough water to support both wildlife and a new development			1
' that kind of water just is n't around there , ' @entity98 said			0
yet the city continues ' to pursue a full buildout and full development at whatever pace the developer wants			0
' @entity70 developer @entity251 and partners in @entity67 , backed by @entity254 investors , have been trying to build at the @entity2 since 1991 , when they began systematically acquiring private land within nearby @entity257 , according to @entity99			2
the town has the right to extract water from the plateau 's aquifer , and its wells have drained water resources by 10 per cent in recent years			2
the park service is urging @entity70 to downsize its plans			2
as they stand , the developments represent ' profound and enormous threats to the park ' , said @entity270 of the @entity271			0
' it 's a grim forecast			0
' the sun rises over @entity274 and is reflected in the @entity37 in @entity110 in september 2013			0

the @entity14 says two planned developments would alter the national park 's vistas and jeopardize its fragile ecology and water supply in the middle of the worst drought on record
@entity25 @entity285 have proposed a development of restaurants and hotels with a gondola ferrying tourists along the river to the canyon floor
the tiny @entity71 town of @entity70 recently approved a plan to build 2,200 homes and three million square feet of commercial space , significantly increasing the pressure on the dwindling natural water supplies
