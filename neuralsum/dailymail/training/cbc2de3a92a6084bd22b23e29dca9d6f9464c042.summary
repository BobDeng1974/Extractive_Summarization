one of @entity2 's largest @entity1 associations has written a letter to @entity5 ministers asking for gun laws to be relaxed to allow @entity1 to arm themselves to protect against terror attacks			1
rabbi @entity8 , the head of the @entity9 , made the request in the wake of the @entity13 attacks in which four @entity1 were killed inside a deli in the @entity16 capital			1
in the letter , dated january 13 , he asks for permission for ' people in the @entity1 communities and institutions to own weapons ' to protect against ' anti-semitism , racism , and intolerance '			2
rabbi @entity8 warned that ' anti-semitism , racism , and intolerance ' were threatening @entity1 in @entity2 while calling for relaxed gun laws ( pictured , @entity16 soldiers guard jewish quarter of @entity13 ) mr @entity8 , who is also the head of the @entity32 of @entity2 , speaks of the need ' stop talking and start acting ' while seeking to reassure ministers by saying the guns will be for ' self - protection only '			1
the letter speaks about the need for protection after @entity40 gunned down four @entity1 shoppers in cold blood in a @entity13 deli last friday before he was shot by armed police			1
the fanatic said he had deliberately chosen a @entity1 shop , claiming his victims were legitimate targets in revenge for the deaths of @entity51 in @entity52			2
police later found he had maps showing the locations of @entity1 schools in @entity13			2
hundreds of armed police have been dispatched to guard @entity1 schools around @entity16 since the attacks last week , with military units standing in reserve			1
the letter also comes amid warnings of a tide of antisemitism across @entity16 as a @entity1 emigration agency warned a record 15,000 @entity1 are expected to flee the country for @entity68 this year			1
in 2014 a total of 7,086 @entity1 emigrated from @entity16 to @entity68 , the highest number in the world , up from 3,293 in 2013			0
@entity68 prime minister @entity72 has set up committee to look at ways of boosting @entity1 immigration from @entity16 and other @entity5 countries ' which are being hit by terrible anti-semitism '			0
his letter comes after @entity79 attacked a @entity1 deli , killing four			0
a letter was found justifying @entity1 as legitimate targets for attacks , along with a map marking @entity1 schools in @entity13 @entity72 's said that every jew who wanted to move to @entity68 would be ' welcomed with a warm heart and open arms			0
' in @entity90 , a survey also found that half of @entity90 believed at least one antisemetic value to be ' definitely or probably true ' when presented with a list of statements			0
one in eight believed @entity1 talked about the @entity95 to get sympathy , one in four believed @entity1 people ' chase money more than others ' , while one in six felt @entity1 thought they were better than other people			0
nobody from the @entity102 was immediately available for comment on the letter when contacted by @entity105 this afternoon			0
mr @entity8 was also unavailable to speak with @entity105 , but told the @entity106 : ' we demanded from the @entity2 governments some time ago that action should be taken [ and ] were not surprised to see the results in @entity13			1
' many people today are not coming to synagogue because of the issue and they â€™d be more comfortable if they knew people were trained to react in an emergency			0

asked for law to allow ' designated ' @entity1 to be armed for ' self - *defence* '
comes after *organistations* warn of rising tide of @entity124 in @entity2
