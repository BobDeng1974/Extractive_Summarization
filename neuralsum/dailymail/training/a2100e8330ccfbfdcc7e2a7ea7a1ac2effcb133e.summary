the photo shows the band walking in the ' wrong ' direction across the famous @entity10 zebra crossing - and more importantly shows @entity5 wearing a pair of white leather sandals			1
for decades fans of the @entity2 have suggested the singer was killed in a car crash and replaced with a lookalike - pointing to his barefoot appearance on the @entity10 album cover as proof			2
iconic image : taken at the same time as the famous @entity10 album cover in 1969 , this picture clearly shows @entity5 , third from left , wearing a pair of sandals the photo on the album cover was in fact just one of ten taken during the same 1969 shoot by photographer @entity31 the outtake has been kept hidden away by a music memorabilia expert who put it up for sale at auctioneers @entity37 in @entity38 on tuesday			1
the print had an estimate of £ 10,000 but it ended up selling for nearly twice that amount , to an anonymous private @entity43 collector who bid £ 19,600			2
alive and well : @entity5 on stage in @entity45 last week @entity46 , the music specialist at auctioneers @entity37 , said : ' both we and the vendor are thrilled with the price it achieved			1
' although there were 25 chromogenic prints of frame two of the shoot made at the time , it is still very rare for one to come on the market			2
' the market is also very strong for @entity2 memorabilia and it is these two reasons why it did so well			0
' @entity31 , who died in 2006 , was chosen for the shoot in @entity38 because he was friends with @entity66			0
it was staged in august 1969 and featured @entity68 leading the band over the zebra crossing next to the @entity10 studios			0
the location has become something of a mecca for @entity2 fans , and thousands of tourists have the photographs taken at the pedestrian crossing every year			0
in 2010 the crossing was given @entity80 listed status so it can be preserved for the future			0
according to a theory at the time , @entity5 died in an accident and was replaced with a lookalike			2
conspiracy theorists believed the @entity10 cover contained clues , as the band wanted to reveal the truth of their guilty secret			0
@entity68 , in white was seen as a preacher leading a funeral procession , @entity94 ’s black outfit indicated he was an undertaker , while a denim - clad @entity98 was the grave - digger			0
this left @entity5 as the corpse because he was barefoot and out of step with the rest of the band			2
other so - called ‘ clues ’ include a car number plate relating to his age - 28 - if he had been alive , and the grouping of onlookers			0
it was also claimed that the fact left - handed @entity5 had a cigarette in his right hand had significance			1
the theorists constructed a back - story that @entity5 had been beheaded in a car crash earlier in the 1960s and the @entity2 had continued with a replacement the band , and @entity121 , always denied this			1
