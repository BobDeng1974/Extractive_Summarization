by @entity0 a bus driver in @entity2 had a ' soul - touching ' moment on saturday when he watched as one selfless passenger gave his shoes and socks to a perfect stranger whose only footwear was a couple of plastic hairnets			1
bus driver @entity11 - a 16 - year veteran driver for the @entity12 in @entity13 - was off duty and returning from the @entity17 ’s @entity16 parade when he witnessed the random act of kindness			1
@entity11 managed to snap a few photos of the exchange and shared them on social media			0
the man on the right noticed that the man on the left had no shoes when he saw him on a bus in @entity2			1
so he gave him the shoes he was wearing and walked home barefoot ' it made my heart melt , ' he told @entity35 , a @entity2 media company			2
' he just took his shoes and socks off and said , " you can take these , do n't worry about me — i live close by and can walk			2
" ' people usually do n't care or even look at other people on the bus , they did n't even want to sit beside this guy because of how he was dressed			0
' the kind - hearted man who selflessly handed over his shoes to his less - fortunate fellow passenger was reached by phone , but asked the news outlet to not identify him by name because his @entity51 faith requires that charitable acts be done anonymously			1
