a new @entity1 documentary has revealed the daily front line battle between pro-choice and anti-abortion campaigners in @entity4			1
separate laws to the rest of the @entity7 mean that abortion there is illegal unless a woman ’s life is in danger , even when the baby has no chance of survival			2
in the @entity17 , the law is similar , but there is the added rule that an unborn foetus has the same rights as the pregnant woman			0
a new tv show reveals the battle women face to have an abortion in @entity4 and the @entity17 , including @entity26 , pictured , from @entity27 , who had to spend £ 1,000 to travel to @entity28 to undergo a termination the law means 5,000 women from @entity17 travel to @entity33 every year to undergo a termination			1
despite the law already working in their favour , pro-life campaigners like @entity36 frequently organises rallies through busy town and city centres , brandishing placards that are plastered in pictures of unborn foetuses			2
not content with the rules already in place , these groups are trying to change the minds of pregnant women who may be considering travelling the hundreds of miles to a place like @entity28 , where a termination will be legal			2
but there is a growing movement of opposition in the country – of young men and women who want to change the laws on abortion			1
the @entity1 documentary , called @entity61 : @entity4 's @entity62 ? follows four women as they show how the current law in the country has affected them			1
in the show , the presenter meets 16 - year - old @entity68 from @entity69 , who is an active member of the pro-life group @entity36			1
@entity68 , 16 , from @entity69 is a pro-lifer who campaigns against abortions every week in the city centre every weekend , @entity68 and her friend @entity74 erect a stall in @entity69 city centre that host a range of pictures and lie - size models of unborn foetuses			0
@entity68 ’s fervour comes from her belief that she is representing the voice-less – the babies that ca n’t speak up for themselves			0
for her , there are no exceptions , including if a woman has been raped			0
she tells the cameras : ‘ no , because one child is never any more important than another			0
' i think that not killing a human life is far more important than for a woman to choose if she wants to have a baby or not			0
' in the rest of the @entity7 , abortions up to 27 weeks were legalised for women in 1967 because of growing concerns about the highly dangerous backstreet terminations that were taking place			1
in @entity33 , @entity102 and @entity103 , women can get a termination on the @entity105 if they decide that they are unable to cope with a child			2
but in @entity4 , women can face up to 10 years in prison for undergoing a termination			1
this law means thousands of women every year are forced to pay for flights to @entity33 and to pay for their termination			2
pro-life campaigners gather in @entity116 , @entity117 , as @entity17 prepares to legislate and introduce regulations to allow abortion if there is a real and substantial risk to a woman 's life , including the threat of suicide			1
in january 2013 the tv show visits the home of a young woman in @entity27 , who has fallen pregnant with her live - in boyfriend ’s baby , despite being on the contraceptive pill			1
@entity26 has invited the cameras to follow her on her journey to @entity134 in west @entity28 to undergo her termination because she wants to show how difficult the laws in @entity4 make it for young women like her			1
she says : ‘ someone needs to tell their story - there are women having to go over on a daily basis to @entity33 for an abortion , yet nobody is talking about it , all the same			1
‘ the stigma that 's attached to it , the fact that you have to actually leave the country for it			0
' i 'm just not ready to have a child , we 're not ready			0
' i think that i can offer so much more to a child ten years down the line than now , that 's what i want for me and that 's what i want for my future kids			1
‘ i 'm sure there are people out there who will think that i am the devil for doing this but i know it 's the only option that seems right to me right now			2
' @entity26 and her boyfriend then spend £ 1,000 on flights , accommodation and medical aid on a 24 - hour trip to @entity28 to undergo the termination			0
despite putting on a brave face , @entity26 is visibly shaken when she leaves the centre where the abortion took place			1
a pro-life campaigner protesting outside the @entity181 in @entity69 , where the @entity182 claimed tight abortion restrictions in @entity4 were exposing pregnant women to an increased risk of death @entity26 says : ‘ i feel really but i also feel guilty for feeling relieved at the same time			1
' i ’d love to be at home just cuddling my dog now , in my own bed			0
it has been a long day and it has been tough			0
' i feel really angry that they 're ignoring women ( at home in @entity4 ) at the moment and ignoring the fact that they should have this choice			1
' this could have been so simple , it could have happened two weeks ago when i found out			0
' they should n't have control over my uterus - i deserve that choice and it was taken away from me by my government			0
' you deserve to be treated as a human and not as a criminal			0
’ despite the very strict laws in the country , some women are fighting back			2
the programme meets a pro-choice campaigner who is actively promoting abortion in @entity4			1
@entity216 , 25 , from @entity69 recently graduated from university and is training to become an adult education teacher			0
she had an abortion two years ago by purchasing pills over the internet that started a miscarriage			2
she is now putting up stickers in her local neighbourhood directing other women to the site , so that they can also go through with a termination if they ca n’t afford the costs involved in travelling to the @entity7			2
she said : ' i have a @entity7 passport but it is completely different to a @entity7 passport of someone in @entity28 , because i can not have an abortion in an @entity105 hospital			0
‘ i have to travel			0
‘ the only way that things will progress here is to show that the law is completely unworkable			0
' abortion : @entity4 's @entity62 ? is on @entity243 tonight at 9pm .			1
