controversial : @entity0 was given a £ 74,000 increase in his pension and a £ 20,000 salary rise after being promoted two months before retirement a senior police officer retired two months after securing a promotion that boosted his taxpayer - funded pension by £ 375,000 , it has emerged			1
chief superintendent @entity0 was made assistant chief constable in november and given a £ 20,000 pay rise			1
but by january the officer was working his last shift after significantly bumping up his retirement fund			0
it came just weeks before a colleague at @entity15 also left with up to £ 450,000 extra in a similar arrangement			1
@entity17 completed her final working day in may – just five months after being promoted from assistant chief constable to temporary deputy chief constable			0
altogether , the two promotions could cost taxpayers more than £ 830,000 in additional pension payments if the pair live to their average @entity25 life expectancies			0
yesterday it emerged that mr @entity0 , 48 , was interviewed for the new role just eight days after the force said that he would have to quit in january under the controversial @entity30 rule , when he would have reached 30 years ’ service			1
on november 11 he was promoted to assistant chief constable , which exempted him from the measure – and boosted his annual salary from around £ 74,000 to £ 94,000			1
taking into account his lump sump entitlement and an annual pension pot for a life expectancy of 78 , it means he can rake in an astonishing extra £ 374,829			0
he officially retired on april 1 after owed holiday was taken into account			0
in miss @entity17 ’s case – reported in the @entity44 last week – promotion saw her salary increase by 40 per cent to £ 140,000			2
that equated to an extra £ 83,493 lump sum and £ 373,280 annual pension , taking her total promotion - linked payouts to £ 456,773			0
home : mr @entity0 , who lives in this £ 475,000 detached house in @entity54 , is now believed to have secured a taxpayer - funded pension lump sum worth more than £ 350,000 like mr @entity0 , @entity56 , 50 , also had time off owed for holidays and only officially retired last month			1
@entity58 , a @entity58 mp in @entity59 , condemned the payouts as ‘ common ploys ’ to boost retirement packages across the public sector			0
the revelations also come at a time when @entity15 is carrying out recruitment freezes in an effort to save £ 150million			1
the news of mr @entity0 's promotion comes a week after assistant chief constable @entity17 ( pictured with @entity70 in 2011 ) was set for a £ 450,000 pension bonus seven months after being promoted @entity72 , 75 , who worked for the force for 28 years , added : ‘ it is morally repugnant that these two senior officers are being allowed to cash in large sums by hoodwinking the powers that be			1
it is just sheer greed			0
’ next year , pay reforms will see police pensions based on average career earnings instead of a final salary figure			0
@entity15 said both officers were promoted after a recruitment process led by the chief constable			2
mr @entity0 yesterday declined to comment at his detached home in @entity54			0
boost : mr @entity0 's promotion earned him £ 49,333 in the two months before his retirement the salary rise from £ 74,000 to £ 94,000 led to a huge boost to mr @entity0 ’ pension pot and potential tax - free lump sum			1
officers receive two thirds of their salary as annual pension upon retirement - but based on the best or highest salary year of their final three years			1
mr @entity0 ’ final year salary was a combination of 225 days at the salary at £ 74,000 and 140 days at £ 94,000 , working out at around £ 82,000			1
under his chief superintendent salary , the senior officer would have received two thirds of his £ 74,0000 salary as an annual pension , working out at £ 49,333			1
but his final year promotion means his annual pension rocketed to around £ 62,666 - a rise of £ 12,700 per annum			2
officers can cash in the maximum 25 per cent allowed of their pensions upon retirement , called commutation , to receive a lump sum and a reduced annual income			0
if mr @entity0 cashed in the maximum 25 per cent of his former chief superintendent ’s pension , he could have banked a £ 276,878 lump sum and a reduced annual pension payment of £ 47,000			1
but his new final year salary means he can cash in the maximum 25 per cent and receive a £ 351,707 lump sum - an increase of £ 74,829			2
his annual pension would then be set at £ 47,000 - up £ 10,000 on his previous figure			2
that means if mr @entity0 had commuted the full 25 per cent of his pension by the time he reaches the average male life expectancy age of 78 he would have netted an extra £ 300,0000 annual pension			2
this includes an extra £ 4,829 lump sum bonus - taking his total promotion - linked payouts to £ 374,829			0
if the officer had not cashed in his lump sum and claimed his full £ 49,333 annual pension income on his old salary , he would have received around £ 1,479,990 million by the time he had reached 78			0
but after promotion that figure , without any commutation , would have risen to £ 1,879,980 - a rise of around £ 400,000 .			0

chief superintendent @entity0 was earning £ 74,000 a year
the 48 - year - old was set to retire from @entity15 after 30 years
but he was given a £ 20,000 salary hike weeks before he was *due* to leave
move was *criticised* as the force faces cuts of almost £ 150million
