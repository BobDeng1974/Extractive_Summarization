a bear in @entity1 has learned how to walk after being found with spinal problems that made it difficult for the young cub to move			1
@entity5 , a sun bear who lives at @entity8 near the capital @entity10 , used to be able to only take a few steps before becoming tired			0
the cub was found in a blue basket by @entity14 , an organization that works to rescue bears that have been captured by black market bear farmers			1
@entity5 , who weighs 24lbs would have likely been kept as a pet in a small cage and ' he would likely be dead as he has a curved spine , ' @entity14 told @entity40			2
physical trauma at an extremely young age most likely caused the cub 's spinal troubles			1
sometimes he would give up altogether and stop moving			0
the organization consulted veterinarians after @entity5 's rescue and said that it faced ' difficult consideration of euthanasia if he began to show signs of chronic pain '			1

he still becomes tired , but is building up his strength			0
free the @entity14 used money from donations of care kits to provide 24 - hour assistance to the animal from local bear keepers			1
he was bottle - fed at least eight times a day and given joint supplement and anti-inflammatory medicine			0
@entity5 and @entity57 live in an enclosure with pools , rocks , hammocks , climbing frames , plants and toys			0
they will eventually grow to around 145lbs , but it will be difficult to release them into the wild because of their time spent in captivity and the rapid destruction of their habitat			0
thousands of @entity110 bears are farmed for their bile , which contains a chemical called ursedeoxycholic acid used in traditional medicine , according to the @entity116			0
there are an estimated 10,000 farmed bears in @entity119 , where it is legal			0
the animals live in cages where they are unable to move and some of their gall bladders swell to the size of watermelons			2
