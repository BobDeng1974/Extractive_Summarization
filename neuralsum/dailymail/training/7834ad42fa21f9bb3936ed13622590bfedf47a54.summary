@entity0 , 23 , of @entity8 , was killed in february this year , just weeks after @entity9 was placed into a medically - induced coma following a similar accident			1
a coroner has now called for safety improvements at an @entity3 ski resort and urged @entity15 heading off on skiing holidays this winter to wear helmets			1
mr @entity18 lost control on a steep run in @entity22 during the first day of a holiday with his parents , younger brother and godfather			1
the it worker - who was an experienced skier - fractured his skull when he collided with the 15ft long boom arm of a snow machine while skiing on a black run			1
his inquest in @entity35 heard that the boom arm was left across the ski run and was not padded , although the machine and its pedestal were			1
recording a verdict of accidental death today , @entity41 coroner @entity40 urged further safety precautions			2
he said : ' this is a tragic matter			0
these snow making machines are increasingly used , and i suspect this year more than ever , as resorts try and have a full season and can not afford to lose customers if there is not adequate amounts of snow			1
' one finds snow making machines at many modern resorts across @entity56			1
it seems to me that the marking of this snow making machine was probably inadequate			1
' witnesses referred to other resorts where they have bright , luminous tape and certainly a @entity63 also note that the pedestal and the machine itself were padded but not the boom			1
' sadly , i think @entity0 did not appreciate the difficulties he was facing coming down the slope			0
' what i think happened is that for some reason he fell or lost control , probably coming down onto the blue run , and as a result he hit the boom with enormous force			1
mr @entity18 - an experienced skier - either ' lost control or fell ' in the moments before the crash			1
pictured on a earlier holiday in the resort he added : ' his father , who was not present , said he was probably flying through the air			1
' whether padding on the boom would have assisted ... it certainly might have helped			2
also i do urge everyone these days to wear helmets			1
' one reads and hears of many cases where people 's lives are saved			1
sadly he died very shortly after the incident			0
' mr @entity40 said that he would be writing to the @entity98 highlighting his concerns and depending on its response , he would consider raising the matter directly with the @entity3 authorities			1
' certainly there should have been padding on the boom			2
i am very unhappy about the position of snow making machines and i think that the primary cause of this accident , ' the coroner said			2
the accident happened at the skiing resort of @entity22 , @entity112 , where the 23 - year - old was on holiday with his parents , younger brother and godfather in february this year mr @entity40 concluded : ' if the boom had been pointing to the side of the ski slope i doubt i would be sitting here today for this very tragic incident			1
' @entity122 told the inquest that he saw mr @entity18 set off in front of him on the slope but did not see the collision			2
mr @entity122 , from @entity35 , who is mr @entity18 's godfather , said he did not learn of the tragedy until he returned to his hotel later that day			0
mr @entity18 graduated from @entity8 with an economics degree last year			0
pictured with girlfriend @entity131 ' the skiing conditions were perfect , the weather was perfect and there was not a cloud in the sky , ' he said			0
' @entity0 was not wearing a helmet			2
it was really , really hot , around zero degrees , which does n't seem a lot but when you are in @entity112 it 's hot			0
' the boom was across the slope , rather than down the slope			0
it was the way they left it - it presented a 15ft target to hit			0
' going back the following day it looked to me a little bit negligent to leave it in that position - in my mind it was negligent			0
' mr @entity18 had recently graduated from the @entity8 with a degree in economics and had started a job at an it firm			0
his family , who have since moved to @entity161 , were not present at the hearing			0
speaking after his death , his father @entity163 said he wanted changes to be made to prevent any similar accidents			0
' there 's an element of risk [ in skiing ] but what i have said is that it should n't be any more risky than it needs to be , ' he told get @entity8			0
' if you stick a 15ft - long steel bar across a slope in a position , if someone comes down at speed and loses control they will be thrown into it at 50mph , that 's not helpful			0
' it 's a tragic accident but what they have to do is think about the placement of the obstacles on the ski slopes , especially on black slopes where if you lose control it 's going to be at speed			2
' in december 2013 , just over a month before mr @entity18 's accident , @entity9 was seriously injured in an accident at @entity195 in the @entity196			0
the racing driver was wearing a helmet , which shattered due to the force of the impact when he fell onto a partially - covered rock			2
