a training memo issued to @entity2 agents appeared to tell them that they should not detain drunk drivers on one of the busiest sections of the @entity10 - @entity9 border			1
the @entity12 memo told @entity13 and @entity2 ( @entity14 ) agents in the @entity17 , @entity18 , sector of the border that they have three options when they encounter intoxicated drivers : detain them at the request of local law enforcement , detain them without the involvement of another agency or let them go on their way			1
@entity10 @entity2 agents in @entity18 received a training memo that appeared to tell them they should let drunk drivers go on their way due to fears of a civil suit and a jurisdictional grey area with local law enforcement the memo examined the civil liability of each of the three options , given that @entity2 has no legal authority to arrest drunk drivers			1
it acknowledged that it may feel counter-intuitive for an agent to let a drunk driver go on their way			0
' there is no legal requirement for a @entity2 agent to intervene in a state crime , including @entity45 , ' and ' therefore there is generally no liability that will attach to the agent or agency for failing to act in this situation '			0
should local law enforcement officers ask for an individual to be detained , border agents have no duty to detain the suspect - and doing so can increase the civil liability for the agent and the agency			1
however , the memo goes on to say that policy is to cooperate with local and state law enforcement officers who alert @entity2 of suspected violations under state law			1
local @entity2 remember agent @entity65 who was killed by a drunk driver in 2010			1
it is unlikely they would let a drunk driver go today the third option is to detain a drunk driver with no request from local law enforcement			1
this poses the greatest liability for the agent and agency in the form of a civil law suit , according to the memo			0
only by letting a drunk driver go free is the agent and agency free from liability			2
the memo does concede that an officer who chooses to detain a drunk driver is still ' acting within the course and scope of his employment '			2
conservative groups have been quick to decry the contents of the memo which was first brought to light by @entity93			0
' families across @entity10 are now at risk on the roads , as president @entity97 and his appointees at the @entity12 have given illegal aliens a license to drive drunk , ' said @entity93 president @entity101			0
however , @entity102 , president of the local 2544 , the union that represents @entity2 agents , told @entity105 5 : ' i can assure you that the agents i represent and the people i work with just would not release someone who was severely intoxicated			1
' he added that agents carry a certain moral authority after the 2010 death of agent @entity65 near @entity115			2
@entity65 was killed on duty by a drunk driver			0
' especially since we were hit hard by the death of one of our own			0
how could we release them ? ' @entity102 said			0
the group @entity122 ( @entity122 ) , said in a statement : ' @entity122 urges all law enforcement officers to protect the public by following standard procedures when encountering anyone suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs			0
law enforcement is the first line of defense in preventing drunk and drugged driving , and their efforts are crucial to keep our roadways safe			2
' @entity13 and @entity2 released a statement to make clear that the intent of the memo was to inform agents of their legal options when encountering drunk drivers based on judicial precedent , ' not direct [ them ] to detain or not detain these drivers '			1
' in cases where @entity2 agents encounter possibly impaired drivers , they are trained to exercise their professional judgment when assessing the current situation			0

a leaked training memo from the @entity12 tells @entity2 agents they can let drunks driver go on their way
agents in @entity18 were **advise*d* that the could be liable in civil lawsuits if they detain drunks drivers , but not if they let them go
@entity2 has no legal authority to arrest drunk drivers but is encouraged to cooperate with local law enforcement
a local union for @entity2 said they would not let intoxicated drivers go free , especially after the 2010 death of an agent killed by a drunk driver
@entity2 officials were quick to *clarify* that the memo was to *advise* agents of legal standing , not to direct them to *ignore* drunk driving
