by @entity0 by tuesday afternoon the @entity1 had leaked much of president @entity2 's @entity4 speech , but one detail was as closely guarded as the nation 's nuclear launch codes : who 's the designated survivor ? the answer : energy secretary @entity11 , an @entity13 nuclear physicist , will stay behind to run the government in case the worst happens and the entire @entity16 disintegrates in a hail of radioactive cannon - fire			1
the idea is a relic from the @entity21 : if the @entity23 were to launch a missile attack on @entity25 during the annual address – when the president , vice president , cabinet members , @entity31 justices and every member of @entity33 gather in one chamber – someone had to live on to lead the country and mount a response			1
' designated survivor ' : secretary of energy @entity11 was chosen to watch @entity2 's speech from an undisclosed location this year , to guarantee the continuity of government if the rest of @entity45 's leading officials were attacked and killed when they gathered in a single place when president @entity2 delivers his annual @entity4 address , one of his cabinet members will be somewhere else , tucked away for the sake of the @entity51 @entity45 officials in charge of all three branches of government will gather tuesday night in the @entity56 to hear @entity2 speak			1
what would happen if the unthinkable should occur while every @entity45 political target was in the same place ? line of succession : vice president @entity63 would become president if @entity2 should die in office , putting him literally ' a heartbeat away ' from the @entity67 speaker of the house @entity68 would take over the presidency if both @entity2 and @entity63 were dead or unable to perform their duties , providing an unprecedented party switch since @entity68 is a @entity74 he or she – the @entity1 chief of staff typically chooses from among members of the president 's cabinet – is whisked away well in advance of the speech to one of @entity25 's famed ' undisclosed locations , ' just in case			1
and the public only learns who drew the short straw a few minutes before the president arrives at the @entity16			2
the practice is believed to date back to the late 1950s , but the public was n't made aware of it until the @entity93 administration			1
some have gone out of town			0
others escaped to @entity25 's suburbs for dinner			0
one , hhs secretary @entity99 , hung out in the @entity100 of the @entity1 in 1996 , at the opposite end of @entity102 from the @entity16			1
after the 9/11 terror attacks , however , the routine became more serious and the locations more clandestine			0
the @entity106 keeps records of which presidential cabinet member has set out on @entity4 night			1
any of them could have become president in an instant if a terrorist attack or a nuclear missile had killed the rest of the federal government 's leaders.2014 : energy secretary @entity117 : energy secretary @entity118 : agriculture secretary @entity119 : interior secretary @entity120 : hud secretary @entity121 : attorney general @entity122 : interior secretary @entity123 : attorney general @entity124 : @entity126 secretary @entity125 : commerce secretary @entity127 : commerce secretary @entity128 : attorney general @entity129 and transportation secretary @entity130 : interior secretary @entity131 : @entity126 secretary @entity132 : energy secretary @entity134 : hud secretary @entity135 : commerce secretary @entity136 : agriculture secretary @entity137 : @entity139 secretary @entity138 : transportation secretary @entity140 1994 : agriculture secretary @entity141 : interior secretary @entity142 : agriculture secretary @entity143 1991 : interior secretary @entity144 : @entity126 secretary @entity145 1989 : education secretary @entity146 1988 : interior secretary @entity147 1987 : agriculture secretary @entity148 1986 : agriculture secretary @entity149 1985 : commerce secretary @entity150 : hud secretary @entity151 * speeches given in the first year of a presidency are not called @entity4 addresses , but presidential addresses before @entity155 of @entity33 the practice of setting aside a designated survivor is n't confined to @entity4 speeches			1
several presidential inaugurations have featured a designated odd - man - out to respect the @entity51 in case the federal government 's leaders simultaneously go kablooey as the result of what homeland security analysts call a ' decapitation attack ' on the @entity45 since 2003 a handful of members of @entity33 have also been asked to stay away from the @entity16 during the annual presidential address , in order to keep the legislative branch of the government alive in case of a terrorist attack			1
the @entity45 @entity51 provides for a line of succession in case the president should die while in office			2
the sitting vice president takes over immediately , as @entity181 did after @entity183 's assassination			1
but if the veep should die too , the @entity184 becomes acting president , and then the president pro tempore of the @entity189			0
if they 're all dead , the @entity67 goes , in order , to the secretaries of state , treasury and defense , and then to the attorney general , and so on – a list 18 names long			0
everyone on the list is currently eligible to serve as president with one exception : secretary of the interior @entity203 is a naturailzed @entity45 citizen who was born in the @entity206 , so she ca n't assume the office			2
the @entity208 officially controls the movements of the designated ' survivor ' each year			0
@entity210 , the former interior secretary who sat out the speech in 2011 , told @entity212 that ' there are serious preparations and serious consideration of different scenarios ' when the time comes			0
the designated survivor is sworn to secrecy and briefed on the procedures involved with ensuring the continuity of government			0
' they walked you through the @entity1 and showed you the @entity224 and talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor , ' @entity99 told @entity212			0
so someone from president @entity2 's leadership team – although it wo n't be clear who until just before 9:00 p.m. est – will be absent when he uncorks his annual stemwinder			1
in 2010 , hud secretary @entity231 was the designated ' survivor ' for president @entity2 's speech			1
but then - secretary of state @entity233 was also out of town , attending a @entity236 conference on battling radical @entity238 sects in @entity239			0
because the public knew where to find her , @entity240 could n't be the official ' survivor			0
' but if calamity had struck , she would have become @entity45 's first female president , since the @entity248 comes well before the @entity249 in the order of presidential succession			2
but had her husband @entity253 and his entire administration , plus the @entity33 , all bitten the dust in 1996 , @entity99 would have beaten her to it			0
the odds of a president dying in office are slim enough , but the chance the his entire cabinet and the leaders in both houses of @entity33 kicking off at the same time are astronomical			2
the @entity265 estimates , based on @entity45 history , that a @entity45 president has a 1 - in - 27 chance of dying in office each year			2
compound that across the 18 people in the line of succession , and calculate their odds of all dying on the same day , and it comes to 1 in 357 quattuordecillion			0
that 's 357 with 47 zeros after it			0
whoever is sitting the speech out tuesday night had better not quit his or her day job : the @entity67 curtains are n't due for a change until january 2017			1
after @entity68 , the presidency would fall to @entity286 , the @entity288 @entity287 who serves as president pro tempore of the @entity189 @entity290 in the @entity1 mess : secretary of state @entity292 is the first cabinet member in line to take over the top job if the others above him in line are all dead or incapacitated treasury secretary @entity297 could be president , provided @entity2 , @entity63 , @entity68 , @entity286 and @entity292 were all dead -- and @entity297 himself had managed to survive if a sitting @entity45 president dies while in office , the @entity51 provides for an order of succession to ensure the continuity of the executive branch of government			1
here are the lucky officials , in the order in which the job of president would fall to them			0
* @entity309 is a naturalized @entity45 citizen born outside the @entity45 , so she can not be sworn in as president			2

' official survivors ' have been **tapped** by @entity313 since at least the late 1950s
for @entity4 speeches and some inaugurations , a single cabinet member stays with a secret service protection detail instead of attending
the plan is in place in case a terror attack or a nuclear strike were to hit the @entity45 @entity16 while every top federal government official was present
the vice president , @entity31 justices , cabinet members and every member of @entity33 will gather to hear @entity2 's speech tuesday night
agriculture and interior secretaries are more *frequently* **tapped** for the *assignment* ; the @entity1 chief of staff *traditionally* chooses
