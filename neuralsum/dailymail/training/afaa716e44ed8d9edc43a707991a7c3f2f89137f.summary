@entity0 is ' quietly confident ' tighthead prop @entity1 will be fit in time to ease @entity3 's front - row injury crisis against @entity4			1
@entity5 boss @entity0 conceded it is a worry @entity1 has not featured in a month through groin trouble , but still backed the 34 - year - old to cope against the @entity4 next weekend			1
@entity10 tighthead @entity9 had been lined up for his @entity11 against @entity4 , but suffered biceps tendon damage in a training clash on thursday			1
tighthead prop @entity1 has n't featured in a month but will be required against @entity4 in november @entity10 tighthead @entity9 had been lined up for his test debut but injured his bicep in training @entity17 and @entity18 you are standing by to cover @entity1 from the bench , but the duo boast just three caps and no @entity11 starts between them			1
@entity0 lamented the ' @entity23 ' of sending undercooked @entity17 , @entity24 and further tightheads @entity25 and @entity27 into provincial action this weekend just a week away from facing the @entity4			1
' @entity9 sustained some tendon damage in his biceps in an incredibly innocuous event , but a frustrating one for both him and us , ' said @entity0 of the @entity10 prop now sidelined for 16 weeks			1
@entity5 coach @entity0 addresses his squad in training on friday ahead of the @entity37 internationals ' he just caught a player running past him , and it was just the angle , just the way it happened ; it 's just one of those things			1
' @entity1 is progressing pretty well , so we are quietly confident			0
he 's taken part in some of the more static aspects of training			2
and he involves himself in some of the more static aspects of the game , so hopefully he comes through and can be involved in some of those			0
' absolutely it 's a concern ( that @entity1 has not played for a month )			2
but @entity1 has been working really hard , in his defence			0
' there 's nothing like game conditions though , to bring game awareness			2
you want guys to have had that ; you want it to be second nature , what they are doing			0
@entity63 ( centre ) and the rest of the @entity5 squad are put through their paces at the @entity68 ' if it was a perfect world things might different but you work in the world that 's available to you , and i 'd still say it 's an incredibly exciting challenge to play one of the form teams in the world , and certainly one of the top - ranked			1
' @entity5 will launch their three - test @entity80 series against @entity4 at the @entity68 on saturday , november 8 , without at least 15 regulars missing through injury			1
@entity83 will miss the entire series with ankle trouble , compounding loosehead prop resources and adding to @entity88 's workload with @entity89 a long - term absentee			2
@entity0 admitted he had to resist the temptation to pull the likes of @entity24 and @entity17 out of club action this weekend , believing they must sharpen up ahead of potential @entity11 action			2
the @entity5 squad held an open training session to the public on friday in @entity98 at the @entity68 ' obviously @entity99 is playing for @entity10 against the @entity100 , and @entity17 will have some time at @entity101 , ' he said			1
' @entity27 will play for @entity102 and @entity25 for @entity103 , those are our other options			0
' it 's a @entity23 , because @entity9 was the starting prop at @entity10 and has really dominated the starting time ( and ) @entity18 needs the game time			0
' @entity27 certainly needs to play ; he 's been sat behind @entity109			0
@entity101 winger @entity110 poses for pictures with fans at the @entity68 in @entity98 on friday ' @entity25 has been massively underplayed because he 's had a succession of injuries and @entity17 the same			0
' so it 's not a lot of rugby for those guys in the last two weeks to then have a week off and go into a test match , it would be pretty difficult			0
' so we 're just going to hold our breath and hope that those guys come through okay and that we 'll have some options live from that group			0
