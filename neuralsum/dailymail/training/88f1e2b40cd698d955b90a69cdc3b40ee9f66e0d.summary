by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:30 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 11:41 est , 19 september 2012 the @entity2 today admitted it must do more to tackle racism in football as it prepares to interrogate @entity5 over allegedly abusing rival player @entity6			1
a report by a powerful committee of @entity9 today warned problems still exist with racism in the game , with @entity12 acting as a new platform for abuse			1
next week @entity5 will face an independent panel after he was charged by the @entity2 of using racially abusive language towards @entity6 last october			1
@entity20 ' @entity19 defender @entity6 ( left ) avoided shaking hands with @entity22 's defender @entity5 ( right ) before saturday 's match between @entity20 and @entity22 at @entity24 he was found not guilty by @entity25 in a criminal trial , but faces another fight to clear his name next week after being charged by @entity2 chiefs			1
@entity31 mp @entity30 , chairman of the @entity32 , said : ‘ recent incidents of racist abuse in the @entity35 , both on and off the pitch , have highlighted the fact that there remain significant problems			1
’ he said social media has become a ‘ tool for the spread of racist and abusive content , but it is also a potential means of combating the ignorance and prejudice that lie behind such behaviour ’			2
football authorities should use online forum to spread ‘ positive messages ’ about equality and diversity , he added			0
‘ more needs to be done to increase the diversity of the pool of candidates for coaches and referees , to embed the values of equality and diversity at all levels of the game			0
’ in response to the committee ’s report , the @entity2 said much progress had been made to tackle racism in the game but there remained room for improvement			1
in a statement the @entity2 said : ‘ we agree with the @entity73 that whilst substantial progress has been made to promote equality and tackle discrimination in the game , challenges remain for all of the football authorities			2
‘ we remain committed , along with all of our stakeholders , to promoting equality and diversity within the game and to the eradication of all forms of discrimination in football			0
‘ we will continue to work across the entire breadth of the sport to deliver our inclusion and anti-discrimination agenda			0
in doing so , we will consider in detail how the @entity73 ’s recommendations can support and influence this work			0
’ @entity5 was acquitted of abusing @entity20 defender @entity6 in a criminal trial at @entity25 court but was later charged by the @entity2 the report also called for more candidates from ethnic minorities to be trained as coaches and referees , with more transparent recruitment of managers and directors to encourage greater ethnic diversity			1
but it stopped short of recommending the @entity104 be adopted - the system used in @entity85 in the @entity106 where shortlists for any head coach or senior management vacancy have to have at least one ethnic minority candidate			0
@entity111 , executive director of @entity113 anti-discrimination network fare , said the @entity9 had missed an opportunity to set out clear ways of achieving more black managers and coaches			1
@entity111 said : ‘ there have been headline issues that @entity19 football has experienced over the last year , the @entity119 and @entity5 cases , and those are very big issues that we need to deal with			2
‘ but the report had no clear direction on diversity hiring practices			0
“ we now have less racism in football because people respect the achievements of black players but where is their role in the game as coaches and managers			2
football needs to be given the lead			0
‘ we have a significant @entity140 population in @entity35 but where are the @entity140 players ? '			0

@entity32 says @entity12 is *fueling* the problem
next week @entity5 will face an @entity2 panel over alleged racist abuse aimed at @entity6
