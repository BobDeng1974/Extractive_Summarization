@entity0 has received the backing of @entity3 legend @entity2 , who strongly believes the @entity4 should n't be sacked - even if the club fails to finish in the top four			1
@entity3 , who were beaten by @entity8 on saturday , are currently fourth but face strong competition from @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 for a place in the @entity15 elite			2
speaking on @entity16 , @entity2 says he is fully behind @entity17 , who has come under pressure in recent weeks , despite his side only losing once in their last five			1
@entity0 is being backed by @entity2 to carry on as @entity3 boss even if they fail to finish fourth @entity2 did admit however that finishing outside the @entity25 places would be a failure he said : ' @entity0 should not be sacked [ if @entity3 fail to make the top four ]			1
' it would be a terrible season for @entity3 and @entity0			1
he would probably say it was a big failure because he knows his job this season			0
' he has to get in the @entity25 but , on the other hand , if he did n't , no , you ca n't just sack a manager one year and then sack another manager the year after			2
where do you go from there ? @entity39 ( centre ) slots the ball past @entity42 to equalise for the home side during their 2 - 1 win ' there has to be a level of continuity			0
i absolutely believe this time there will be continuity at @entity3 and they will stand by him even if he does n't finish in the top four and that 's the right thing to do			1
' @entity2 is still hopeful his former side can qualify for the @entity25 but admits they need to step up and make the final part of the season count			1
' i still think @entity3 will finish in the top four , he added			1
' i think they will scrape in			0
@entity60 had given @entity17 's side the lead at the @entity63 but they were still beaten ' at the start of the season i thought they 'd finish third			2
' there is a period in march where they have @entity71 in an @entity73 quarter - final , then they have @entity12 the sunday after and @entity11 after that			0
there is an international break and then they have got @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
' that will be a big period but , actually , @entity17 and @entity3 started the season really poorly and these big games came along and they seemed to grow			1
' i 'd like to think these games will inspire some of the bigger players at @entity3			0
they need to step up their performances			0
there is no doubt about that			0
' @entity90 fires a shot into the @entity3 goal - with the help of a @entity95 deflection			2

@entity2 believes that @entity0 should *remain* as @entity3 boss - even if they fail to finish in the top four
the *pundit* admitted it would have been a terrible season if they failed to finish in the @entity25 places
@entity2 told @entity16 that he still thinks they will finish in the top four
