' @entity13 talks to @entity8 about her political future more than anyone else , ' a long - time @entity12 insider said monday in @entity16			1
that ' anyone else ' presumably includes @entity12 , the former president			0
' everyone else is just guessing at this point , but her daughter will have more influence than all the fundraisers and political operatives put together			1
' in a wide - ranging profile of the would - be @entity27 candidate , @entity24 reported sunday night that ' it would be hard to overstate the closeness between @entity8 and her only child , who is known to have more of her mother ’s signature caution and private approach , than her father ’s more free - wheeling style			2
' the former first daughter , now a married 33 - year - old , has her famous mother 's ear at a critical time in the decision - making process playing it coy : ' i am very strongly exercising my prerogative as a daughter to make sure my mom has this year to rest and reflect , ' @entity3 said in october @entity47 : @entity8 , pictured here with husband @entity12 at @entity50 's inauguration as @entity52 mayor last week , is the subject of constant speculation over her political ambitions that closeness , it seems now , is carrying over into her mother 's political decision tree			1
' @entity8 has met with political professionals who want her to run , of course , ' the strategist with decades - long @entity12 ties told @entity64			1
' but you can count those meetings on one hand			0
' ' she talks to her daughter several times a week , and they 're not just chatting about the foundation , or when @entity12 and @entity8 are getting a grandchild			1
they 're talking about the family legacy , and that includes a 2016 @entity77 run			0
' @entity13 , now 33 , has become an articulate spokeswoman for the @entity79 , a charitable project of the foundation that now bears her name alongside those of her parents			0
as the newest family standard - bearer , she 's asked often for insight into what could be a second @entity12 presidency			2
' before anything else , she is my mom , ' the younger @entity12 said in october during @entity93 's ' @entity92 ' in @entity16			0
' so i want her to do whatever she wants to do			0
… i am very strongly exercising my prerogative as a daughter to make sure my mom has this year to rest and reflect			0
' she was confident , she said , that her mother would ' make the right choice			0
' that choice is already a work in progress : one @entity103 political reporter noted the presence of @entity12 national adviser @entity105 in the @entity103 on monday			2
@entity8 is seeking advice from several long - time advisers , including long - time insider @entity108 ( r ) @entity103 's first - in - the - nation primary election is often a predictor or @entity27 and @entity112 nominations , although @entity12 herself won that contest in 2008 and failed to close the deal			1
bosom buddies : @entity8 discusses more with @entity13 than just her future grandkids , an insider told @entity64 @entity12 advisers plan to visit @entity120 , another bellwether primary state , later in january			1
the portion of the campaigns - and - elections industry that 's loyal to @entity27 politics has been busy recruiting @entity8 to run , according to @entity24			1

but competing outside organizations are building a shadow campaign , partially without @entity12 's input or permission			1
it includes a national ' @entity140 ' effort , which splashed a bumper - sticker campaign on sunday with help from retired army general @entity144			0
' one of the best ways to spark these conversations about @entity8 potentially running in 2016 is by showing your support right now , ' @entity144 wrote in an email to @entity12 's supporters			2
@entity12 's campaign organization , which lost the @entity27 nomination to @entity153 in 2008 , rented its list to ready for @entity8			1
priorities @entity1 , a pro-obama super pac , is another organization that is grooming itself to launch a more formal @entity12 campaign the moment the formal secretary of state gives the nod			2
