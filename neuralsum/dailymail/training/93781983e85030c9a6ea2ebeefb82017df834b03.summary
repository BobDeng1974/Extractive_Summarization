@entity0 hung on to draw the fourth and final test against @entity2 in @entity3 as @entity4 and @entity5 frustrated the home bowlers			1
@entity2 appeared on course for victory as @entity0 slipped from 178 for two to 217 for seven but , on a pitch that had offered little throughout , the decision to take the new ball soon after the seventh wicket had fallen backfired for captain @entity13 with his bowlers unable to find any further movement			1
that allowed @entity4 and @entity5 to steer the tourists through to the close , with @entity4 finishing on 38 not out and @entity5 an unbeaten 20 , with @entity0 97 short of their victory target as they made 252 for seven			1
@entity21 ( pictured ) and @entity2 were left frustrated on the final day of the fourth test against @entity0 @entity4 ( left ) dug in with @entity5 to earn the tourists a draw at the @entity25 but @entity13 's side still won the series 2 - 1 as the captain ( centre ) celebrated the test victory @entity31 poses with his son @entity32 inside the @entity34 dressing room afterwards @entity35 and his fianc√©e @entity36 alongside their daughter @entity37 @entity13 embraces partner @entity39 as @entity2 managed to sweep aside @entity0 taking the new ball was a rare mis - step from @entity13 , who was named man of the match and man of the series after taking over from @entity46 , who was injured in the first test			1
@entity13 has steered @entity2 to an emotional 2 - 0 series win after the death of @entity50 prior to the series opener			1

' there was a little bit of spin and a few opportunities that did n't go our way			0
it was one of those days			0
the wicket was still playing pretty well , for the fast bowlers it was still up and down , and i thought the boys toiled well today			0
' it 's been a good series for me , batting out there and captaining these boys			0
i 've had a great time			0
we could n't quite get home today but i 've really enjoyed being able to captain the boys throughout this series			2

@entity13 - pictured holding the @entity89 - is could be bringing in a new dawn of @entity34 cricket it had looked as if the hosts would win comfortably after @entity94 ( left ) took the wicket of @entity96 when @entity96 followed for 46 , pushing @entity98 into the slips , the wickets began to fall quickly , with @entity100 and @entity101 out for ducks and @entity103 making just one			1
at the end of the next over , with @entity0 on 218 for seven , @entity13 took the new ball , and @entity2 's chances swiftly dried up as they went back to bowling short deliveries			1
@entity4 and @entity5 saw off 12 overs before handshakes signalled the end of the match			1
' it has been a hard fought series , ' @entity0 captain @entity96 said in the presentations			1
' we wanted to play hard cricket , give a fight , and that is what the boys have done			0
in @entity122 , and even today we thought we had a chance , but @entity2 kept coming back			2
' the way they have composed themselves after the ( @entity50 ) incident and come out is commendable			0
at tea time , i was not 100 % sure if we wanted to go for the target			0
after @entity79 got out , i thought why not take a chance , we are not coming back here for a while , if it does not happen it does not			0
' the intent and character the side is showing is important			0
these guys have stepped up and shown they have the character and game at the international level , @entity141 especially after the kind of debut he had			0
it is tough in @entity2 , i have experienced that before			2
' both teams will now turn their attentions to the coming @entity148 , but for @entity2 this was a series win made all the more significant for the poignant tributes to @entity50 throughout			1
