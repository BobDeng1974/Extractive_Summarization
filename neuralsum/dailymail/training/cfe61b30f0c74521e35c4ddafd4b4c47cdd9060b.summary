@entity0 wants @entity1 to build on their impressive victory over @entity3 by going on a long unbeaten run			1
@entity1 pulled off one of the most impressive results of the season on sunday when they defeated @entity3 2 - 0 at the @entity7			1
@entity9 's team have a poor record against their top - four rivals , but the @entity12 rarely looked in trouble during their trip to the north west and the result means they remain within one point of fourth place			1
@entity0 has urged his team - mates to build on their impressive 2 - 0 win at @entity3 @entity1 striker @entity21 celebrates scoring against @entity3 @entity0 battles for possession with @entity3 captain @entity24 @entity1 would be much higher in the table had they performed more consistently this season			1
the @entity12 have not won more than two successive @entity28 games this season , but @entity0 hopes that will now change in light of sunday 's victory over the champions			1
' we have got a lot to play for this year so hopefully now we can build on this performance and that will give us even more confidence going into the business end of the season , ' the @entity1 midfielder said			1
' there is still a long way to go in this league			2
many teams are taking points off each other			0
we will just have to concentrate on our own game and hopefully go on a big run and see where that takes us at the end			0
' it was important to win because all the other teams won			0
the pressure was on us			0
' @entity3 have made this place a fortress over the years			2
not many teams come away with three points so we are delighted with the way we went about it and we are happy we closed the gap			0
' @entity21 surges forward past @entity24 ( right ) and @entity61 ( left ) @entity1 forward @entity62 dribbles with the ball @entity64 jostles with @entity65 on sunday sunday 's win was the first time @entity9 had beaten @entity3 in the league since april 2012			1
the @entity12 have failed to beat @entity69 in just over three years and they have only beaten @entity70 once since 2008			2
@entity1 's ability to open up the top teams in the country has never been in doubt			2
last year they scored three times at the @entity7 , but on sunday they also matched that attacking verve with solid , disciplined defending			1
@entity21 heads past @entity3 keeper @entity77 to make it 2 - 0 to @entity1 @entity79 celebrates with @entity21 after scoring his side 's opening goal from the penalty spot @entity0 hopes @entity1 's defence will grow in confidence as a result of the win			1
' it was important to [ get a win away from home against a big team ] , ' the @entity87 said			2
' we have always been confident coming into these games but we have been a bit too open in the past and we have paid the price for that			0
' on sunday , we defended really well			2
we kept our team shape tight defensively and we took our chances when we needed to			2
' we have shown what we are capable of doing			0
we are going to have chances in games			0
' we are a team that can always create opportunities to score so the important thing is to defend as a team and stop them from scoring because we are always going to get opportunities to score			0
' so if we can keep a clean sheet like we did yesterday , we are always going to have a chance to win			0
' @entity62 sets off on a mazy run through @entity3 's defence surprisingly , no one personified that defensive solidity more than @entity115 , who kept @entity3 star @entity116 in check all match			1
@entity115 has made only 13 @entity28 starts in his @entity1 career and just last month he was on loan at @entity122 side @entity121			1
but @entity0 thinks @entity115 is now starting to show why @entity9 recruited him as a 17 - year - old			1
@entity115 was able to keep @entity3 playmaker @entity116 quiet ' he 's at that age now where he understands the game a lot more and he has done really well in the last few weeks , ' @entity0 said of the 23 - year - old , who has also had loan spells at @entity131 and @entity132			1
' it 's funny how quickly things can change in football			0
' one week he was on loan at @entity121 and then he comes back in and he has been in the team every week			0
he has done a very good job defensively for the team			0
' he wins it back , keeps it simple and just keeps things ticking over			0
' hopefully he can build on his performances that he has been showing of late and he has got every chance of turning into a top defensive midfielder			0
' @entity0 is backing @entity115 to shine after a solid display against the champions @entity115 was signed by @entity9 from @entity148 as a 17 - year - old			1

the @entity1 midfielder has *issued* a *rallying* call to his team - mates
@entity1 ran out 2 - 0 winners at the @entity7 on sunday
it was the first time they had beaten @entity3 in the league since 2012
