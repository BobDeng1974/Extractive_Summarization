@entity0 said : ‘ we wrote to @entity32 ’s people , “ why do n’t we cut to chase and do the fight in march ? ” they have not even responded to say “ s * * off ” or “ not interested ”			1
‘ i ’ve heard nothing at all			0
the fight will be mandated by the @entity15 after his next fight			0
they will then have to sit down with us			0
’ should @entity6 vacate it will validate a prediction unbeaten fury made three years ago			1
