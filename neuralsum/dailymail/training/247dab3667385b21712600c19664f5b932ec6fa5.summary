president @entity0 will remain at the @entity1 on both monday and tuesday as voters head to the polls to determine whether to oust his political party from power in the @entity6			1
a copy of his public schedule reveals the president 's plans to return to @entity11 on sunday after campaign events in @entity13 and @entity14 and stay there through @entity16			2
on monday @entity0 will sit down with @entity18 chair @entity17			2
the following day he 'll take other meetings at the @entity1 instead of barnstorming the country , campaigning for endangered @entity21			1
while the president will be out of sight this week , republicans , who have framed the off - year elections as a ' referendum ' on @entity0 , hope he will not be out of mind			1
a final pre-election survey conducted by @entity29 and the @entity30 shows that the second - term president 's approval rating is still down in the dumps			0
election forecasts now give his party a 74 percent chance of losing the @entity6 to @entity37			1
today he 'll stump for democrats in @entity13 and @entity14 , but tonight he 'll head back to the @entity1 @entity45 : president @entity0 is participating in get out the vote activities this weekend for @entity21 but he 'll stay out of sight at the @entity1 on monday and tuesday as his party barrells toward defeat in the midterm elections the percentage of @entity54 who disapprove of the job @entity0 's doing has stayed steady at 51 percent over the last month and a half , data released by the @entity30 shows			1
his net approval rating is only slightly better than it was in early october , up from 40 percent to 43 percent			0
the president 's inability to win over the electorate before tuesday 's elections was the overriding theme during the final round of weekend prognosticating			2
' this is really the last chance for @entity54 to pass judgment on the @entity0 administration and on its policies , ' 2012 @entity37 presidential nominee @entity66 told @entity72 host @entity71			2
' and the president himself said he 's not on the ballot , but his policies are - that includes hesitancy and weakness abroad , which has led to a certain degree , to the rise of @entity82			0
it also includes the violation of the most fundamental promise of @entity86 , to let people to keep their doctor and their insurance if they wanted to keep it			0
' it 's a policy of basic amnesty for those that come to the country illegally , ' @entity66 said , pointing to @entity0 's promise that he would take immigration reform into his own hands before the end of the year if @entity100 does n't make changes of it 's own to the flawed system			1
@entity66 , a top @entity37 surrogate this election cycle , said his party wants to ' take a different direction			0
' ' we 're to break the blockade in @entity11 by having a @entity37 @entity6			1
we 'll have an energy policy , which means we 're gon na have the @entity110 pipeline			0
we 're going to secure the border			0
we 're jump - start the economy , ' he said , adding that the @entity37 would ' help get people out of poverty ' and ensure ' their kids will have better schools			0
' another favorite campaign buddy of @entity37 challengers this year , @entity37 sen. @entity120 , also cast tuesday as a ' repudiation of the president 's policies			2
' ' this is a referendum on the president			0
so no question , this is a big message to the president , ' @entity120 told @entity130 host @entity129 during an appearance on @entity132			0
after @entity129 asked him if a @entity37 victory this week would serve as a ' mandate ' in favor of @entity37 policies , @entity120 said it 's a ' combination ' of unhappiness with @entity0 and a desire to see an end to the ' gridlock ' in @entity100			2
' it 's a message that people are tired of nothing getting done , ' he said			0
' so i think if we win , you will see legislation passed , and you will see legislation sent to the desk of the president			0
' despite @entity0 's efforts this weekend , democrats are have a 74 percent chance of losing the @entity6 on tuesday , forecasts show @entity157 founder and statistician @entity156 gave @entity37 on sunday a 73 - 74 percent chance of taking of winning the majority in the @entity6			1
the @entity162 's analysts came to roughly the same conclusion , putting the number a tick higher at 75 percent			2
polling site @entity166 now gives @entity37 a two - seat advantage over @entity21 in the @entity6 , though the status of eight contested races is still in flux - two of which may take additional run - off elections to decide			1
if key elections and @entity175 and @entity176 both go to a run - off , it could be two months before the fate of the @entity6 is decided			1
republicans may win enough competitions to take control of the @entity6 outright , however , regardless of what happens in either run - off scenario			1
although republicans are widely predicted to retire several of her colleagues on tuesday , @entity185 sen. @entity184 said sunday morning she still has hope for her comrades			2
she acknowledged that the president is better liked in some areas of the country than others , then argued that @entity21 @entity6 candidates were able to win statewide in 2012 , when @entity0 was last on the ballot , in parts of the country that voted for @entity66			1
' i think a lot of that has to do with the fact that we have candidates that are independent of whatever the administration 's policies are , ' she told @entity208 host @entity209			0
' you certainly see them disagreeing with him on number of policy issues			0
' these are moderate @entity21 , ' she said , who ' for the most part who have shown that kind of civility that we want in @entity11			1
' taking a jab at outspoken conservative sen. @entity223 of @entity224 and his filibuster last year , she said , ' courage is n't just standing by yourself giving speech on @entity229			0
courage is whether or not you 're willing to stand next to someone you do n't always agree with			0
' @entity21 senators fighting for their political lives this year are willing to do that , she added			1
@entity184 rejected the narrative that president @entity0 has not stuck his neck out to save his party this year because of his own political problems			1
' i think first of all we have to acknowledge that the president has helped these candidates in terms of fundraising for the @entity6 campaign committee , ' she said			2
' he 's been out there			0
he 's done a lot of work			0
' president @entity0 will not be out there , standing arm in arm with his party , win or lose , on tuesday , however			1
in fact , if @entity21 do keep control of the @entity6 , @entity0 wo n't be around to celebrate their success when they triumphantly return to @entity11 the president will embark on a trip to @entity260 next sunday evening and wo n't return for nine days			1
@entity100 , on the other hand , is schedule to reconvene next wednesday			0
political parties traditionally hold new member orientation that week , as well , to help the newest additions of the rank and file get settled in before they take the oath of office in january			2
because of his trip , @entity0 will not be on hand to meet and greet new @entity21 lawmakers if and when they first arrive .			1

@entity0 will take meetings in @entity11 on monday and tuesday instead of barnstorming the country for his political party
@entity21 have roughly a 74 percent chance of losing the @entity6 to republicans
while out of sight this week , republicans , who have framed the off - year elections as a ' referendum ' on @entity0 , hope he will not be out of mind
