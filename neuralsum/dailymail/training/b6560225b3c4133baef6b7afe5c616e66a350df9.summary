@entity0 are ready to make another move for @entity2 in the january transfer window following the defensive injury crisis that has engulfed them since losing @entity6 last weekend			1
despite @entity2 ’s failure to live up to expectations at @entity10 , @entity7 still rates the central defender , having been on the point of signing him from @entity14 in january 2010 , before a last - minute intervention by sir @entity16 saw the defender opt for @entity10			2
last month @entity7 had insisted on @entity2 being part of any swap deal that took place with @entity10 for @entity21 – but @entity10 refused to include him and @entity21 ended up at @entity22			2
@entity7 is considering another move for @entity10 defender @entity2 @entity0 tried to sign @entity2 ( above ) in the summer following the loss of @entity21 to @entity22 @entity2 has struggled to live up to expectations himself at @entity10 , though new manager @entity27 has started with him in games and the centre half is currently on his way back from a groin injury and available to play against @entity33 today ( @entity34 )			1
but van @entity27 has also indicated that he wants to add to his defensive positions in january and if that means @entity2 is left out , @entity0 will make their move			2
@entity7 inquired about the availability of @entity2 and @entity40 , another player @entity0 tried to sign in 2010 , when @entity10 and @entity0 were in talks about a potential @entity21 move last month but was told neither was available			1
@entity10 might be sensitive to a deal perceived to be helping @entity0 ’s situation , given the criticism the club received for letting @entity47 joining @entity0 for £ 16m on transfer deadline day and the fact the two clubs are likely to be battling for @entity52 places			0
@entity0 require defensive cover after @entity6 was injured against @entity54 @entity0 players celebrate @entity57 's goal in their 3 - 0 victory over @entity59 only last weekend @entity7 was insisting that three centre halves could be enough to see @entity0 through the season , but with @entity6 now out , possibly for three months if he needs surgery , the club look incredibly frail at the back			1
@entity65 can fill in at right back but is also the club ’s first choice back - up in central defence and is only 19 years old			0
@entity69 played at right back against @entity70 but struggled in a poor @entity0 performance			0
@entity0 are already looking at possible free agents they could sign to bolster their defence in the short term but ultimately it looks as if they will need to make the move to sign another established defender			0
