by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:18 est , 9 june 2012 updated : 16:29 est , 16 june 2012 @entity3 's biggest high - street stores have been accused of preying on vulnerable families by encouraging customers to gamble on their online shopping			1
boots , @entity8 's and @entity9 are among the 150 well - known retailers that offered their internet customers the chance to win their shopping by placing a £ 1 stake on the spin of a roulette wheel			1
shoppers using the stores ' own websites to buy everyday items are told they have an ' unbeatable way to win anything you want '			1
@entity9 is one of the stores accused of preying on vulnerable families by encouraging customers to gamble on their online shopping but last night mps and anti- gambling charities condemned the stores for introducing gambling into the home as an everyday activity – and said families already facing economic hardship risked losing hundreds of pounds while doing their shopping			1
to take part , customers open an online account with a gaming company			1
this allows them to browse through the stores ' catalogues			1
when they find an item they want , they can choose to ' play ' or ' shop '			0
if they click on ' play ' , £ 1 is deducted from their account and a roulette wheel pops up			1
if it lands on red , the user has won the item			1
if they do n't win , they are not required to buy the product			2
but they are encouraged by various incentives , including discounts on future purchases and up to 25 ' free plays ' , to spin the wheel again			1
@entity66 giant boots said it has suspended its account with @entity68 pending further investigation the scheme is operated by @entity71 , a @entity73 gambling business , unregulated by @entity3 watchdogs			1
hours after @entity76 started raising ethical questions about the scheme , several stores began withdrawing from it , apparently concerned over the damage it might do to their reputations			1
@entity68 says that the odds of winning vary according to a complex mathematical formula , but that 85p in every £ 1 spent is returned to prizewinners , with the remaining 15p used to cover profit and costs			2
the site lures customers with promises of ' free ' goods worth up to £ 30,000 and a pledge that ' with @entity68 , you never lose '			1
a tool has also been developed that makes the @entity97 roulette wheel appear each time someone logs on to one of the participating retailers ' websites			0
but although customers were able to play the game directly on the stores ' own sites , many of retailers told @entity76 they were not aware of it , and blamed third - party operators who link between websites to attract more customers			1
@entity116 , @entity9 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity8 's , boots , @entity113 and @entity114 last night said they were in the process of withdrawing from the scheme			2
business secretary @entity121 said he was ' disturbed ' to hear of the scheme , saying : ' gambling is quite rightly highly regulated because of the damage it can cause and it 's clearly unacceptable to blur the boundaries between gambling and retail shopping			1
i am pleased to hear that responsible retailers are moving away from this			0
' business secretary @entity121 said the scheme was ' disturbing ' conservative mp @entity132 said he felt ' very uneasy ' about the scheme , adding : ' online gambling is a terrible evil and if store websites are encouraging people to gamble , i strongly oppose it			1
' if the majority of stores are withdrawing their names from the scheme it sounds very questionable			1
' @entity141 , of the @entity142 , added : ' these companies have behaved in an irresponsible and deplorable way			0
schemes like this are particularly dangerous for people on low incomes because they feel they can get out of their financial difficulties by gambling			0
but the result is often wrecked families and wrecked lives			0
' @entity155 founder @entity154 , an @entity156 businessman , told @entity76 he thought his scheme would work well in this country because the @entity3 are ' confident ' with online shopping and ' love a flutter '			1
his company is run from an office in the @entity73 capital , @entity164 , and is not subject to @entity3 regulation or supervision			1
it is licensed by only one body , the @entity169 and @entity170 of @entity73 , and , as a foreign firm , does not have to register with @entity3 's @entity172 – although proposals to close that loophole were announced in the @entity175			1
a @entity172 spokesman confirmed : ' you do not need a licence from us to run a remote gambling service if all of your remote gambling equipment is located outside @entity3			0
' psychologist @entity184 , who has written a book on the psychology of saving and spending , said : ' over time , you can not win			2
all you can be certain of is that you will get less back than you paid in			0
that is the essence of the bet			0
' sites such as these promote the idea that gambling is acceptable and that the expectation of getting something for nothing is a normal way of life			0
' @entity97 users are encouraged to keep gambling by a variety of incentives , including the promise of discounts on future purchases and special offers of free spins of the roulette wheel			2
another ruse to keep customers on the site as long as possible is to compensate for a failed bet by offering free entry to online competitions			2
shoppers are automatically logged off after an hour as a safeguard against overspending , though there is nothing to stop them logging on again straight away			2
the @entity155 website says players must be 18 or over but customers are required only to tick a box confirming their age			1
if they win a prize , however , they are asked to send a photocopy of their passport or driving licence to obtain the item			2
players can top up their account by up to £ 50 a time , up to £ 200 day			2
@entity3 retailers have become increasingly keen on using affiliate websites , such as @entity68 , to attract new customers			2
an industry source explained : ' there are salesmen out there whose job is to target fledgling websites and link them up to established brands			1
@entity68 did not disclose that it was a gaming site or the stores did not bother to check			2
' when a @entity76 reporter visited @entity97 's registered address – a first - floor office just off @entity251 in the centre of @entity164 – the receptionist said she had never heard of the company but would make inquiries through another firm , called @entity256			0
a man who claimed to represent @entity256 then told our reporter to leave the building , saying : ' ok , enough now			0
can you leave ? it 's private property			0
' last night mr @entity154 admitted he had never struck any deals directly with the @entity3 stores , despite describing them on his website as ' trusted partners '			1
he said : ' @entity97 is here to benefit @entity3 consumers , not mislead them in any way			0
' we are incredibly transparent about our model and we believe it is the first of its kind			0
we have all sorts of processes in place that ensure people can not use the site irresponsibly			0
for example , there are maximum amounts that they can credit to their account at any one time and alerts if they have been on the site for a specific period of time			0
' mr @entity154 said the decision to base the business in @entity73 had nothing to do with reducing tax liability but because ' the process for setting up a licensed gaming business is much faster there ' – and regulators were ' genuinely interested ' in licensing his business			1
last night several retailers said they were launching their own inquiries following @entity76 's investigation			0
@entity116 said : @entity304 & @entity305 has taken action to withdraw from the @entity97 service			0
' @entity9 said : ' having reviewed the nature of the site we have taken the decision to remove it from our affiliate programme '			0
@entity117 said : ' once we were made aware of how this affiliate operated , we ended the arrangement			0
' @entity118 said : ' our legal team is contacting the administrator [ of the @entity155 website ] to request our logo is removed			2
' @entity8 's said : ' we have asked that our name is removed immediately			0
' boots said : ' we have suspended the account with @entity68 pending further investigation			0
' @entity114 said : ' we closely monitor the internet for inappropriate brand associations such as gambling sites and take action when required			0
' @entity327 said : ' we are looking into this			0
' an earlier version of this article said @entity76 on sunday reporters had spent £ 162 on @entity97 plays but won only a £ 20 toy goldfish bowl			1
in fact , one reporter used ‘ free plays ’ acquired during the experiment and went on to win an @entity335 worth up to £ 400			1
and in a different experiment another journalist spent £ 40 and won £ 35 of flowers and a £ 101 @entity341			1
we apologise to @entity97 for not mentioning these			0
also , we said customers can top up their accounts as often as they like			2
in fact , top - ups are limited to £ 200 per day .			0

customers encouraged not to pay for shopping but to gamble to win it
@entity66 giants accused of preying on their most vulnerable customers
trusted brands link up with @entity73 website that tells you to ' spin to win '
shoppers lose £ 15 on every £ 100 they gamble ( but we only won a fish bowl )
