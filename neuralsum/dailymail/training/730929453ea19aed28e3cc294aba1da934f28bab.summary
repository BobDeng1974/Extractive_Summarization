by @entity0 published : 08:56 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 10:46 est , 23 august 2013 stress fuels cancer by triggering a ' master switch ' gene which allows the disease to spread , according to new research			1
the ' unexpected ' discovery could lead to the development of drugs that target the protein and stop tumours spreading to other organs and causing death			0
stress has long been linked to many forms of the disease including breast and prostate cancer , but the reason has remained a mystery			2
doctors have discovered the ' stress gene ' @entity22 can make immune cells behave erratically , giving cancer an ' escape route ' to other areas of the body now a team at @entity29 say our own bodies help turn cancer against us by turning on a ' master switch ' gene known as @entity22 which is expressed in response to stressful conditions in all types of cells			1
usually , it causes normal and benign cells to commit suicide if they decide they have been irrevocably damaged			0
but cancer cells somehow coax immune - system cells recruited to the site of a tumour to express @entity22			1
it is unclear exactly how , but the gene promotes the immune cells to act erratically and give cancer an escape route to other areas of the body			1
professor @entity53 said : ' if your body does not help cancer cells , they can not spread as far			2
so really , the rest of the cells in the body help cancer cells to move , to set up shop at distant sites			2
and one of the unifying themes here is stress			0
' her researchers first linked the expression of @entity22 in immune - system cells to worse outcomes among a sample of almost 300 breast cancer patients			1
experiments on mice then found those lacking the gene had less extensive spread of breast tumour cells to their lungs than ones that could activate it			2
' the cancer cells were always the same , but we had different hosts			0
the primary tumors were similar in size , but only in the host that can express @entity22 - the stress gene - did the cancer cells metastasize efficiently			1
the ' stress gene ' could one day function as a drug target to combat cancer spread ' this suggests that the host stress response can help cancer to metastasize			1
' if the body is in perfect balance , there is n't much of a problem			0
when the body gets stressed , that changes the immune system			1
and the immune system is a double - edged sword , ' she said			1
in general , when cancer cells first appear , the immune system recognises them as foreign and various immune cells travel to the site to attack them			1
prof @entity53 said if further research bear out the results ' the stress gene could one day function as a drug target to combat cancer spread , or metastasis as it is known medically			1
' meanwhile , the results published in the @entity119 provide important insights into how tumour cells use their signalling power to co-opt the rest of the body into aiding cancer 's survival and movement to distant organs			2
although the work suggests a drug to dampen @entity22 's effect could lower the risk for metastasis , prof @entity53 noted scientists do not fully understand what the overall effects would be			2
she said : ' we have this gene for a reason			0
it is a gene that helps us adapt to changes			0
so it is a question of how and when to target @entity22			0
' another new study has found restricting calories for a set period of time - combined with targeted cancer therapy - can increase the success of cancer treatment in mice			1
the journal @entity150 reports that we eat , the body metabolises food to produce energy and assist in the building of proteins			0
if we consume less , the amount of nutrients available to the body 's cells are reduced , which slows the metabolic process and limits the function of certain proteins - including one protein associated with several cancers			0
dr @entity166 , of the @entity167 in @entity168 , said : ' by understanding the link between metabolism and the body 's natural cancer suppressors and activators , we can perhaps improve the efficacy of therapy and improve survival for patients suffering from specific types of cancer			0
' although more research in a clinical setting is needed , the promising results are believed to apply to humans too			0
' we next want to examine what component of a reduced - calorie diet - fats , sugars , or another food compound - influenced the lymphoma cells ' improved sensitivity to treatment			0

study found that stress triggers a ' master switch ' gene called @entity22
this *corrupts* the immune system , giving cancer an fast - track around body
@entity203 could help develop drugs to dampen the ' stress gene '
