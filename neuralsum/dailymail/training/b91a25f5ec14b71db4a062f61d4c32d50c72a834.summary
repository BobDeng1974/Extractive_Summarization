by @entity0 a ' slip - shod ' tradesman who fitted a stone mantelpiece that collapsed and crushed a six - year - old girl to death wept in a court dock today as he was jailed for eight months			1
@entity6 - known as @entity8 - suffered massive head injuries after the heavy stone fireplace installed by @entity10 , 39 , of @entity11 , west @entity12 , crashed on top of her			1
the girl , who attended £ 10,000 - a - year @entity17 ’s @entity16 in @entity18 , @entity19 , was taken to hospital where she died from her catastrophic injuries			1
crushed to death : @entity6 ( left ) - known as @entity8 - suffered massive head injuries after the heavy stone fireplace installed by @entity10 ( right ) , 39 , of @entity11 , west @entity12 , crashed on top of her @entity8 was believed to have been swinging from the mantelpiece when it came away from the wall			1
@entity10 was jailed after a judge branded his work ‘ slip - shod ’ and said he was ‘ guilty of carelessness			1
’ he had taken shortcuts and only sparingly used adhesive to attach the 13st 8lb ( 86kg ) limestones to the wall , @entity32 in @entity33 heard			1
@entity38 , prosecuting , said : ‘ she [ @entity8 ] suffered catastrophic and non-survivable head injuries when a limestone fireplace surround collapsed on top of her , probably as a result of her having swung on it in play			1
‘ the fatal incident occurred on july 7 , 2012 , just over eight months after the fire surround had been fitted by this defendant who at the time was a self - employed fireplace fitter			2
‘ the subsequent investigation into his work on this installation showed a number of shortcomings , amongst which was a reliance purely on adhesive only sparingly applied as the sole means to secure the two uppermost and heaviest stones to the wall			1
‘ it was these stones , with a combined weight of some 86kg , which fell on @entity67 and which killed her almost instantly			0
’ @entity10 had been employed by fireplace manufacturers @entity69 as a warehouse operative and driver between 2005 and 2007 , the court heard			1
in 2007 he handed in his notice and became a self - employed fireplace fitter after shadowing others for just three months			2
the court heard that there were no instructional courses available in fireplace fitting			0
hearing : @entity32 ( pictured ) in @entity33 was told he had taken shortcuts and only sparingly used adhesive to attach the limestones to the wall mr @entity38 explained that @entity84 started building a new home for the @entity87 family in january 2011 in @entity88 , @entity19			1
@entity8 ’s father visited @entity90 in @entity88 , and chose the @entity92 limestone fireplace for the ground floor formal living room - and @entity95 ’s contracted @entity10 to fit it			1
the judge heard that the @entity98 had a substantial mantle shelf and was made from extremely heavy limestone			0
mr @entity38 said that there were no specific instructions tailored to the particular mantelpiece and the workman would have been expected to use his own fittings , knowledge and experience			2
' slip - shod ' tradesman : @entity10 hanged his head and cried as details of the case were outlined he added : ‘ it is self - evident that the fitting of such heavy items requires some expertise and considerable care on the part of the fitter			1
this is not a task for the unsupervised @entity120 enthusiast to have a go at			0
’ mr @entity38 explained that despite there being no industry guidelines or standards as to how a stone fireplace should be fitted , a competent installer should be able to approach each job with ‘ sufficient skill and judgement to adopt to the requirements			0
’ ‘ in the case of the @entity133 it should have been self - evident to a competent and careful fitter that the mantelpiece required more that high strength adhesive to ensure a fail - safe bound , ’ he said			2
the court heard that this would have been achievable by drilling into the back of the mantle so that mechanical fittings could be applied to the fire surround and wall			2
@entity10 had only used @entity146 , a high strength adhesive , to the mantle and even that was applied sparingly , the court was told			1
laboratory tests carried out at @entity149 following the tragedy found that if mechanical fixings had been applied to the same mantelpiece it would have required a downforce of 2,290kg to move it , but not cause the collapse			0
the prosecution contacted a number of experts as they built up the case against @entity10 and they unanimously said that they would not have solely relied on adhesive to secure the mantle in place			1
@entity10 , who appeared in court wearing a smart grey suit , grey tie and white shirt , hanged his head and cried as details of the case were outlined			1
@entity10 admitted a @entity170 breach on what should have been the first day of his trial earlier this year			2
@entity173 , defending , said : ‘ this is a 39 - year - old man who thought he had learned a trade , a trade which was going to be the career for the rest of his life			0
‘ he will never fit another fireplace again ... he understands this has destroyed the @entity87 family ’s life and not a day goes by he does n’t himself think about what happened			0
‘ the sense of guilt he feels is immense			0
this is a tragedy of unimaginable proportion			0
’ the court heard that as a result of the accident @entity10 had recently been working as an @entity192 driver			2
judge @entity193 told him : ‘ this is a dreadful tragedy			0
‘ your failure to properly and safely to fix a very heavy stone fireplace in the @entity183 home led to it coming away from the wall and falling on @entity67 , a six year old little girl , killing her			0
' the effect of the dreadful events upon her parents and three brothers will last the rest of their lives			0
there will be a void in their lives ' judge @entity193 ‘ the effect of the dreadful events upon her parents and three brothers will last the rest of their lives			0
there will be a void in their lives			0
‘ as has been said the loss of a life , particularly that of a child , can not possibly be measured in terms of a sentence that the court imposes upon the person deemed responsible			0
’ judge @entity193 branded @entity10 ’s work ‘ slip - shod ’ and said he gave no thought to the risks			2
on jailing @entity10 for eight months and ordering him to pay £ 1,000 towards costs , he added : ‘ it must be made clear to persons that go into homes professing to be a skilled workman and carry out slip - shod and unsafe work that result in death , that they must be punished			1
’ @entity8 ’s father attended the hearing but did not comment after @entity10 had been jailed			1
at the time of her death , her headmistress said : ‘ she was a very special little girl with an infectious love of life			0
she will be remembered for her wonderful smile , her laughter and her caring gentle nature			0
