westerners fighting for @entity1 are taking part in a sickening circle of violent one - upmanship in order to prove themselves to commanders who consider @entity9 militants little more than cannon fodder			1
ranked well below battle - hardened foreign jihadis from warzones such as @entity13 and @entity14 , the @entity0 believe ultra-violence is the only way to make their name in @entity18 and @entity19			2
this would partly explain why so many @entity22 extremists are eager to take part in the terror group 's sickening propaganda releases , such as the seven savage filmed beheading videos featuring depraved @entity28 terrorist @entity27 , also known by the name @entity30			0
militants : ranked well below battle - hardened foreign jihadis from warzones such as @entity13 and @entity14 , westerners believe ultra-violence is the only way for them to rise up the ranks in @entity18 and @entity19 @entity22 fighters waging jihad in @entity18 and @entity19 often appear disillusioned by the mundane jobs they are given upon arrival			1
@entity28 militants have previously been known to complain on social media about being ordered to clean toilets or wash the plates of senior terrorists			0
by far the most common job for @entity22 jihadis , however , is guarding prisoners			1
while some complain that this involves little more than standing bored in a doorway or handing over meals , others have used their unlimited access to these defenceless so - called ' enemies of the state ' to build a reputation for the kind of shocking cruelty and sadism @entity1 commanders appreciate			1
one former prisoner has now revealed that many of the thousands of @entity9 who have flocked to join @entity1 over the past year have been shocked to find themselves marginalised within an organisation where @entity19 and @entity65 nationals rule			1
' they come ­ expecting a heaven and when they see the reality they are shocked , ' a @entity18 former prisoner identified only by the name @entity68 told @entity74			0
' there is a hierarchy in @entity1 and the foreign fighters and the @entity18 are at the bottom of it , ' he added , revealing that fighters from @entity81 consider themselves the group 's military wing , while @entity65 are largely dominate religious affairs			1
doomed : the @entity18 former prisoner , identified only by the name @entity68 , revealed he had been held for a short time alongside @entity85 before the @entity87 journalist ( left ) was savagely murder by @entity30 ( right ) flying the flag : it is widely - understood that @entity28 travelling to @entity19 and @entity18 to join the @entity91 are so unfit and badly trained that they are used as little more than cannon fodder @entity68 , who was sentenced to death and spent six months in an @entity1 prison 18 miles north of @entity95 before taking part in a daring but successful jailbreak three - months ago , also revealed that he had been held for a short time alongside @entity87 journalist @entity85			2
@entity85 was later transferred to another prison by @entity99 , before being savagely murdered by the aforementioned @entity100 on january 31			0
' there are two ways to prove your allegiance to @entity105 : either by getting married or by carrying out the punishments , ' @entity68 said , using an alternative acronym for the terrorist organisation			0
they were merciless - the ­ foreign fighters and the ­ @entity18 treated us the worst because they are the lowest in @entity1 , ' he went on to say			2
it is widely - understood that @entity28 travelling to @entity19 and @entity18 to join @entity113 militant group @entity1 are so unfit and badly trained that they are used as little more than cannon fodder			2
many of them are unable to communicate in @entity117 and when not cleaning and cleaning for senior commanders tend to while away their days on social media where they pretend to be vital cogs in the @entity1 wheel for their gullible sympathisers in the @entity123			0
outcast : many of the thousands of @entity9 who have flocked to join @entity1 ( pictured ) over the past year have been shocked to find themselves marginalised within an organisation where @entity19 and @entity65 nationals rule speaking last year , @entity130 - director of the @entity131 at @entity132 - said @entity28 fighters in particular are poorly rated			1
' in a context like @entity1 in @entity18 you have all these battle - hardy @entity13 and then you have some fat guy from @entity137 turning up , ' he told the @entity138			0
while many of the @entity9 extremists joining @entity1 tell their commanders they will be willing killers , very few of them have ever even held a gun by the time they arrive in @entity18 or @entity19			1
useless in combat and a liability in situations when a simple mistakes can cost lives , the few @entity145 who do make it on to the battlefield are used as little more than cannon fodder			0
leading the line when the odds are stacked against them , or acting as suicide bombers to clear the path for more experienced and important fighters , @entity1 commanders convince the young men that their lives on earth are worthless and that to die for the terror group is somehow praiseworthy			2
these arguments are lapped up by the idealistic young fighters who appear not to notice that it is never the commanders or other senior figures within @entity1 who have the ' honour ' of losing their lives .			0

@entity22 jihadis are ranked well below @entity19 and @entity65 nationals by @entity1
they are forced to cook and clean for the more experienced fighters
to prove their worth and build a reputation , @entity9 fighters treat their prisoners with shocking cruelty and sadism
seen as the only way for *inexperienced* terrorists to climb the @entity1 ranks
