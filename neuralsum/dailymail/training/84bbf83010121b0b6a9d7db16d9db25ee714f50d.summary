@entity0 had a penalty shout in the first half when @entity34 looked to have brought down @entity75 inside the area on the half hour but the referee waved away the young winger ’s appeals			2
@entity75 was a constant threat for @entity1 ’ team as @entity0 tried to break the deadlock			1
midfielder @entity52 , starting the game in place of the rested @entity85 and @entity86 , also had a deflected shot go just wide before the break but @entity89 defended well and deserved to go in at half - time on level terms			2
@entity54 had the first chance of the second half but the @entity0 midfielder headed straight at @entity7 keeper @entity95 after connecting with @entity56 ’s free - kick			1
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity49 ( right ) had to be quick to stop @entity97 in the second half @entity54 went close again with a shot from distance as @entity0 pushed for the away goal			0
they were playing without top scorer @entity102 whose hat - trick helped @entity10 to his first win at the club last friday			0
leading the line in place of the rested @entity111 and the injured @entity112 was the @entity107 international @entity51 and his best chance came on the hour when @entity56 crossed from the left but from six yards out he failed to beat @entity33			0
@entity113 ( left ) hugs @entity7 goalkeeper @entity33 after the pair are involved in an incident late in the match @entity53 ( left ) was promptly booked by the referee after his involvement with @entity33 the @entity7 keeper was in fine form blocking a @entity56 shot moments later			2
but the home side were also forcing chances and @entity124 volleyed over from six yards out			0
the chance seem to invigorate the minnows and when @entity29 tumbled over @entity30 ’ outstretched leg there were calls for a penalty from @entity89 ’s players			0
the referee waved away the appeals and sent coach @entity134 off for protesting			1
the teams take the 0 - 0 first - leg scoreline into the return game in @entity13 in two week ’s time			1
the match comes just after three days after the @entity15 derby with @entity16			0
@entity1 may be tempted to play a more first - choice side to ensure progression in the @entity6 .			1

@entity6 match was @entity1 ' first taste as @entity0 boss

return leg takes place on *december* *17* in @entity13
