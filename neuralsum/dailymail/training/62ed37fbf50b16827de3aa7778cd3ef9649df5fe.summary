it 's a fake ! the ruling brings to an end a 46 - year tradition in the town , and a plastic @entity9 will be placed on the float instead - while the human @entity9 walks alongside the float , collecting money from residents the @entity29 's fundraising float has been a highlight of the festive calendar , raising more than £ 130,000 for local charities since it started in 1966			1
in recent years it has been taken over the @entity34 of @entity29 , and after a health and safety assessment this year they ruled it was too dangerous for @entity9 to sit on top of the 10ft float			1
the float used to travel at walking pace around residential streets of @entity42 and @entity43 with a volunteer dressed as @entity8 on top of it in the three - week run up to @entity8			1
in previous years he stood inside the vehicle , with his upper body above the sun roof - but there are concerns this year over a new vehicle that meant he would have to sit in a bolted - down chair			1
grounding @entity9 has caused a row with former members of @entity29 , which set up the tradition in 1966 , and passed over running the float to the rotary club in 2009			1
an insurance firm willing to insure the float with @entity9 on top was found , but the rotary club still decided to scrap the tradition			1

‘ i had a big row with [ the president of @entity104 ] , but i could n't get him to change his mind			0
i said it was ridiculous			0
common sense has gone out of the window			0
’ mother - of - three @entity110 , 43 , from @entity11 , has gone to see the float every year since she was a child and said it was a family tradition to visit the sleigh			1
she said : ‘ not having him on top for three weeks of the year is ridiculous			0
the kids were like “ where 's @entity9 ? ” ' it 's just taking the magic out of it and they raise so much money for charity			1
it was always the highlight of @entity8			0

from my own point of view we have found it better with @entity9 walking as he is able to interact with the youngsters better			2
