the commission that has investigated doping in cycling will not be recommending that @entity4 ’s lifetime ban from competitive sport is reduced			1
the @entity6 stripped of his seven @entity8 titles for using performance - enhancing drugs was hoping the @entity10 would be more sympathetic after he twice gave evidence to the three - man panel			1
but @entity10 , who submitted their report to the @entity16 last friday and are due to hold a media briefing in @entity18 next week , are not planning to recommend to the @entity19 that they reduce their ban			1
@entity4 was stripped of his seven @entity8 titles for using performance - enhancing drugs @entity4 waves from the podium after winning the 16th stage of the @entity25 some reports suggested on sunday that lawyers representing @entity4 placed certain limitations on what @entity10 could ask , which in turn was being given as a reason for the stance @entity10 have now adopted			1
but @entity4 ’s legal team vehemently deny that , insisting that no restrictions were placed on @entity10 in their two interviews with the @entity37			2
only recently @entity4 suggested to the @entity38 that he had answered all @entity10 ’s questions candidly			2
‘ at this point in my life i ’m not out to protect anybody , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m out to protect seven people and they all have the last name @entity4			0
’ @entity4 told the @entity38 that he is out to protect seven people - ' and they all have the last name @entity4 ' the @entity6 leads ahead of @entity45 during @entity46 of the @entity47 @entity4 is sure to be angered by the fact that a number of his contemporaries – who have also been guilty of doping offences – did not even cooperate with @entity10 and yet remain senior figures in the sport			1
@entity55 , the @entity16 president , had warned that such a lack of cooperation would be frowned upon and it will be interesting to see if he sticks to his promise of introducing a fit - and - proper - person test for cycling team officials in the wake of the @entity10 report			2
@entity55 has said the report will make ‘ uncomfortable ’ reading for his sport			0
‘ when you open a can of worms you find a lot of worms , ’ @entity55 said last month at the world track cycling championships in @entity67			0
‘ i think it ’s going to be very interesting - there will be a lot of uncomfortable things there			0
’ @entity55 , the @entity16 president , has said that the report will make for ' uncomfortable reading ' @entity79 revealed to @entity80 that he has spoken to the @entity10 about the problem of doping but he also took a swipe at @entity4 , accusing him of having an ‘ agenda ’ for revealing he had spoken to @entity10 in the first place			1
@entity4 obviously does have an agenda ; he wants his ban reduced when other dopers from his era have not been hit with the same severe sanctions			1
but criticising anyone for revealing they have spoken to @entity10 seems a curious position to adopt when the promise of anonymity might yet protect those who have n’t come forward			0
only last week @entity79 revealed to @entity80 that he too has spoken to @entity10 , having wanted to give a senior rider ’s perspective on the problems that continue to undermine the @entity16 ’s efforts to clean up the sport			0
particularly at a time when the @entity16 are pushing for the racing licence of the @entity106 team – that boasts current @entity8 champion @entity107 – to be revoked .			0
