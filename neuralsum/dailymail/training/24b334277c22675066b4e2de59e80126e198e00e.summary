@entity0 was designed to light up carvings as though they were on display in a modern museum , a groundbreaking 3d scan of the iconic stones has found			1
the latest 3d laser technology revealed new evidence of the importance of the midwinter sunset to the ancient creators of @entity0 , along with 71 new images invisible to the naked eye due to weathering of the stone			1
it suggests that the stonemasons used the best materials where the rays would hit the stone , ensuring they would glisten in the final light of the setting winter solstice sun , or at dawn on the longest day			1
revealing : the new images suggests that the stonemasons used the best materials where the rays would hit them - shining in the last light of the setting winter solstice sun , or at dawn on the longest day the scans revealed ' hidden ' images on many of the stones			1
here , arrow heads are clearly visible on stone 4 of @entity0			1
the laser scan has also revealed many more prehistoric carvings , including 71 new images of @entity38 axe heads chipped into five of the giant stones , bringing the number of such carvings discovered at @entity0 to 115			1
the previously unknown @entity38 carvings are invisible to the naked eye			1
to find them , researchers analysed 850 gigabytes of information			2
3d scanners were used to record billions of points micro-topographically on the surfaces of the monument ’s 83 surviving stones			2
detailed analysis of that data carried out on behalf of @entity53 found images had been engraved on the stones			1
researchers were able to virtually reconstruct parts of @entity0 to get a closer look - this is stone 56 of the area			0
secrets exposed : the latest 3d laser technology has revealed new evidence of the importance of the midwinter sunset to the ancient creators of @entity0 the team used complex laser scanning at @entity0 to gain new insight into the stones			1
3d scanners and digital imaging cameras were used to record billions of points micro-topographically on the surfaces of the monument ’s 83 surviving stones			0
captured at a resolution of 0.5mm , it is the first time a consistent level of high - resolution data has been collected across all the stone surfaces			0
this was usually done by removing the top 1 - 3 millimetres of weathered ( darker coloured ) rock , to produce different sized shapes			0
although now largely invisible to the naked eye , back in the @entity38 the images would have been clearly visible on unweathered stone			1
the varying techniques and amounts of work confirms not only that the builders intended to align the monument on the axis of the sun at midsummer and midwinter , but also that the view from the north east was particularly important			2
researchers said it was clear the stones were meant to be approached from the north east up the ancient processional avenue towards the direction of the midwinter sunset			0
planning : researchers said it was clear the stones were meant to be approached from the north east up the ancient processional avenue towards the direction of the midwinter sunset discovery : the researchers said that as other stones in the monument have more natural , less neat outlines , it seems that the creators were making a special effort to allow a dramatic passage of sunlight through the stone circle at midsummer and midwinter approaching and viewing the stone circle from this direction meant the winter solstice sunset had particular importance to prehistoric people , and efforts were made to create a dramatic spectacle for those coming from the north east , experts said			2
the stones in the outer circle which could be seen on the approach from the north east have been completely ' pick dressed ' , removing the brown and grey crust of the rock on the surface to reveal the bright , grey - white underneath			0
but the outer faces of those on the other side of the outer circle were not worked in the same way			0
the stones facing the north east are also the largest and most uniform , and the lintels are very well - worked and finished compared to those elsewhere in @entity0			0
stones that flanked the north east / south west axis of the summer and winter solstices were most carefully worked to create straight and narrow rectangular gaps			0
shining through : the researchers said that as some stones in the monument have more natural , less neat outlines , it seems that the creators were making a special effort to allow a dramatic passage of sunlight through the stone circle at midsummer and midwinter study : commissioned by @entity53 , the detailed laser scan and digital imaging of @entity0 showed significant differences in how various stones were shaped and worked the researchers said that as other stones in the monument have more natural , less neat outlines , it seems that the creators were making a special effort to allow a dramatic passage of sunlight through the stone circle at midsummer and midwinter			1
professor @entity178 , emeritus professor of achaeo - astronomy at @entity180 , said : ' this extraordinary new evidence not only confirms the importance of the solstitial alignment at @entity0 , but also show unequivocally that the formal approach was always intended to be from the north east , up the avenue towards the direction of midwinter sunset			0
' we see how the utmost care and attention was devoted to ensuring the pristine appearance of @entity0 for those completing their final approach to the monument at the two times of the year when sunlight shines along the alignment - when those approaching had the midsummer rising sun behind or midwinter setting sun ahead			2
' @entity53 said the new presentation of @entity0 , which includes a new visitor centre 1.5 miles away out of sight , involved closing the @entity206 to reunite the stone circle with the avenue from which it was meant to be approached			0
