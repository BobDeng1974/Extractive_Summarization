i saw a pillow in @entity2 the other day that cost £ 85 and i thought : ‘ how can that aid slumber any better than a pillow costing tens of pounds less ? ’ i do n’t know how much the pillows at the @entity9 @entity8 cost – but i would be prepared to pay at least three figures for just one of them			1
viceroy double : guests are cocooned in luxurious wood and treated to astonishingly comfortable beds i ’d had a scout around the hotel ’s website before arriving , and did n't notice any pillow previews			1
they deserve their own microsite			1
as i lie down , the prospect of wakefulness disappears in a flash			1
my head sinks right into the pillow , yet it feels supported			1
in fact , the whole @entity9 bed is heavenly			2
climbing into one is like falling into the arms of an angel			2
in the morning , the weariness brought on by transatlantic travel is banished			2
so i decide to inspect the rest of the ‘ deluxe ’ twin room that i ’m sharing with my travelling companion - my mum			2
the beds are in a cocoon of rich wooden furnishings , from the bedside wardrobes to the writing table			2
it does n't feel like a hotel room , more like someone ’s trendy @entity49 apartment			1
the bathroom is a work of art , with an impossibly grand round mirror above the sink			2
it is complemented by a satellite shaving mirror that you can swing from side to side on a metal arm			2
a walk - in rain shower completes the set - up			2
the @entity9 @entity8 , which opened last october , has other aces up its sleeve – one being the location			1
for one , it is on @entity67 , which puts you within walking distance of a whole feast of @entity72 musts			1
breakfast in style : mother @entity75 reads up on @entity8 's tourist attractions in the @entity78 restaurant tasty : the @entity78 restaurant 's frittata with crumpets , plus a smooth cup of coffee @entity84 ? two minutes ’ walk away			1
@entity85 ? seven minutes south , by foot			1
@entity87 ? you ’ll measure the time it takes to get there in seconds			1
@entity93 , meanwhile , is practically next door			1
before you head out though , do not skip the @entity9 breakfast			2
it is served in the hotel ’s bistro-esque @entity78 restaurant - where the decor resembles that of the bedrooms , with the same tones , luxurious woods and sumptuous leather			1
the coffee is smooth and strong , the orange juice long and fresh , the frittata with maple bacon spot - on – and the service nothing short of exemplary			2
@entity110 complimentary wi - fi beats by dr. @entity112 audio sound systems in each room @entity115 spa products rooftop bar with amazing views superb dining at the @entity78 restaurant beautifully choreographed styling the dinner experience is similarly enticing			2
i ’m always encouraged by menus that do n’t have too many dishes on them – it ’s usually a sign that quality is the priority			2
and that ’s the case at @entity78			0
it is a fusion of @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 cooking , with offerings such as roasted wild king salmon with asparagus and green onion , braised pork shank with roasted shallots , certified angus 32oz cowboy rib eye and lamb chops with chickpeas and yoghurt			0
me ? i go for the @entity147 with white cheddar and giardiniera relish			0
it is tender and perfectly cooked , but does look a bit lonely on the big white plate			0
i ’m surprised the hotel has n't caught on to the hipster method of burger presentation , using a wooden chopping board , given the hotel ’s love of quality wood			1
mother @entity75 opts for a shaved kale salad with goat cheese and toasted almonds , which also gets the thumbs - up			0
i wash down the burger with a @entity167 sauvignon blanc , which is suitably fruity			0
the quality of the restaurant is underscored by the fact that people not staying at the hotel travel here to dine			1
the rooftop bar is also a destination watering hole – a magnet for trendy young professionals			0
popular : the @entity78 restaurant is a big draw for tourists and @entity181 amazing view : the rooftop bar looks out over @entity84 watering hole : the @entity9 rooftop bar offers drinkers an urbane environment in which to quench their thirst but it ’s the view that is the biggest draw			1
it almost makes me gasp			0
the rooftop looks out over @entity84 and the whole of upper @entity49			1
at 29 floors , the @entity9 is by no means the tallest building in the area , but it does n’t need to be - because it ’s higher than enough of the surrounding structures to facilitate prime cityscape gazing			1
the bar takes mixology seriously			0
@entity203 cocktails include the @entity204 , made using @entity206 whiskey with apricot liquer			1
we stay on a monday and tuesday , and the atmosphere is lively on both nights			0
there is also a bar at the front of the @entity78 restaurant , at street level , which is similarly beguiling			0
there are a few extra snazzy garnishes at the @entity9 that raise its cool factor			0
i like the fact that you sign in by finger - writing your signature on an @entity223 at the reception desk – and that every bedroom comes with a @entity227 beatbox - and a smartphone pre-loaded with information about the hotel , from room service to the cocktail menu			1
@entity234 , meanwhile , is free and very fast			0
are there any downsides ? yes , but we ’re quibbling here			0
@entity9 @entity8 does n't have a lot of girth , and some may find the standard rooms a tad compromised space-wise			0
but for a few nights , they are perfect			0
relaxing : @entity244 reads up on the tourist musts in the lobby roomy : the @entity9 's suites have ample square - footage there are 240 rooms in total , including some pricier suites - 43 of them - with more space for spreading out			0
also , for the room price , you might expect the hotel to offer a swimming pool			1
this is a hotel that inflates your ego – you ’ll want to boast to people that you are staying there			1
it has poise , finesse and beautifully choreographed suave styling that may make you feel as if you are living in an aftershave advert			0
scent - sational : staying at the @entity9 is a bit like being in an aftershave advert @entity9 @entity8 rooms start at $ 309 ( £ 186 ) per night ( $ 309 )			0
