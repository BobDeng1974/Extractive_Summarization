a gay couple who wed earlier this month on a @entity2 airfield after more than 20 years together have secured a legal victory which means their marriage is recognized in their home state of @entity8			1
the decision by federal judge @entity10 to grant @entity11 and his husband @entity12 a temporary restraining order against the 2004 @entity8 law banning recognition of their marriage came despite a warning from the state 's attorney general that it could contribute to a broad rewriting of @entity8 law in favor of such unions , which are currently banned in the state			1
the victory has added significance for the couple because @entity11 is expected to die soon from @entity30 's disease and the decision means his death certificate will show that he was married and that @entity32 is his surviving spouse			1
just married : @entity11 ( right ) , who suffers from @entity33 , grins alongside his partner of 20 years , @entity12 , just moments after they married aboard a plane in @entity2 earlier this month the ruling also means the pair can be buried next to each other in @entity11 's family plot , located at a cemetery that only allows descendants and spouses			1
the couple filed a lawsuit on friday against @entity8 gov. @entity46 , attorney general @entity47 and a @entity49 official responsible for filing death certificates which stated that ‘ they very much want the world to officially remember and record their union as a married couple ’			1
though @entity10 's order was specific to the couple 's case , opponents of @entity8 's ban on gay marriage were encouraged by it			1
‘ this is one more step toward marriage equality in the state of @entity8 , ’ said the couple 's attorney , @entity63 , who said he 's gotten calls from other same - sex couples who married in other states and are exploring their options to have their marriage recognized in @entity8			1
only @entity12 was in court last friday to file the lawsuit as his husband @entity11 is seriously ill and close to death he said that when he told @entity11 and @entity32 about monday 's ruling , they were overjoyed			1
‘ this is more than just a legal form , ’ @entity63 said			0
‘ it 's the state where these men have built their lives , the city where they built their lives , finally turning to them and saying , “ yes , we do recognize that you 're a couple as much as any opposite - sex couple and that your life and now your death will be honored in a way that other married couples would be treated			1
’ ” the couple , determined to marry before @entity11 died , flew in a special jet with medical equipment to @entity2 , which recognizes gay marriage			2
they wed july 11 inside the plane on an airport tarmac before returning to @entity49 the same day , according to court records			0
in his ruling , @entity10 said that historically , @entity8 law has recognized out - of - state marriages as valid as long as they were legal where they took place , pointing to marriages between cousins and involving minors			1
‘ how then can @entity8 , especially given the historical status of @entity8 law , single out same - sex marriages as ones it will not recognize ? ’ @entity10 wrote			1
‘ the short answer is that @entity8 can not			2
’ the ruling means the couple can be buried next to each other in @entity11 's , left , family plot , located at a cemetery that only allows descendants and spouses @entity47 's spokesman , @entity123 , said in a statement that ‘ this is a temporary ruling at a preliminary stage under sad circumstances			1
’ he said @entity47 's office will defend the right of @entity130 to define marriage and that the @entity133 @entity132 has recently emphasized that it is a definition that traditionally lies with states			2
‘ @entity8 's voters are entitled to the choice they have made on this fundamental issue , ’ he said			2
@entity46 spokesman @entity139 said in a statement that the office does n't comment on pending litigation , ‘ other than to say that the governor believes that marriage is between a man and a woman			0
’ @entity10 wrote that the couple would experience irreparable harm without his timely ruling			0
‘ the uncertainty around this issue during mr. @entity11 's final illness is the cause of extreme emotional hardship to the couple , ’ @entity10 wrote			1
‘ dying with an incorrect death certificate that prohibits mr. @entity11 from being buried with dignity constitutes irreparable harm			1
’ together : the couple , pictured with @entity11 's aunt - who married them - decided to exchange vows after the @entity161 was defeated by the @entity132 but could still not do it in @entity8 in an emotional ceremony , @entity11 married @entity12 from his stretcher earlier this month - just two weeks after the @entity132 struck down the @entity161			1
' i 'm overjoyed , ' @entity11 told the @entity165 after the ceremony			2
' i 'm very proud to be an @entity133 and be able to openly share my love for the record			0
i feel like the luckiest guy in the world			0
' when faced with where to go , their options were limited due to @entity11 's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - or @entity33 - a progressive neurological disease that affects patients ' speech and movement , and eventually their breathing			1
he is bedridden and had not left their home since march			0
they decided to marry in @entity2 as only one partner had to go for the license before both went for the wedding			0
@entity11 knew he would be unable to make the journey twice			0
they chartered a small medical plane which cost $ 12,700 to rent with the help of generous donations from relatives and friends - and people they barely knew			0
@entity12 flew to @entity195 before the ceremony to obtain the marriage license and flew back just two days later with @entity11 so their lengthy relationship could finally be legally recognized			1
strong : a sticker on the back of their van shows @entity11 who is confined to a wheelchair due to his @entity33 @entity11 suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , also known as @entity33 or @entity30 's disease after the baseball player who had the illness			2
in sufferers of the disease , nerve cells waste away or die , which leads to muscle weakening , twitching and an inability to move limbs			0
the condition means it is impossible to carry out day - to - day tasks such as walking or swallowing			0
as the condition worsens , the muscles in the chest area stop working and it becomes hard for the sufferer to breathe on their own			0
the disease in incurable and 90 per cent of sufferers die within three to five years of their diagnosis			0
the condition affects around five in 100,000 people worldwide			0
after the 90 - minute flight , they arrived in @entity195 with a nurse , two pilots and @entity11 's aunt , @entity234 , who had been ordained to marry the two men			1
remaining inside the plane , they listened to @entity234 speak as they gripped hands			0
' twenty - six months ago @entity11 was diagnosed with @entity33 , ' she said			2
' since then the amazing relationship between @entity11 and @entity12 has become even closer , even more devoted , even more loving - and it was pretty damn great before @entity11 became ill. ' after the seven - and - a - half minute ceremony was finished , they drank @entity243 and headed back to @entity49 , finally legally recognized as married - although they had felt they were for years			1
' in our minds we 've always been married , but now i can actually say @entity11 's my husband and have a piece of paper , and a @entity132 ruling , and a federal government that says yes , he is your husband , ' @entity12 told the @entity165			1
' i 'm overjoyed that we ’ll now have a piece of paper that confirms what we 've always known in our hearts - that we 're an old , married couple who still love each other			0
' the couple met twice through a friend in 1992 before meeting again at a @entity261 and experiencing ' love at third sight '			0
within weeks , they had swapped rings and months later they moved in together			0
wedding venue : they stayed inside the plane and married on the tarmac at @entity270 at @entity195 / @entity271 just over two years ago , @entity11 felt his left leg dragging during a trip to @entity274 , and when he returned to the @entity133 , he was promptly diagnosed with @entity33			2
his condition has worsened and is no longer able to walk			0
there is no cure for the illness , which eventually affects breathing and claims the sufferer 's life within two to five years after diagnosis			0
with the onset of @entity11 's illness , the couple felt the weight of not being able to marry ; some employers did not allow them to share a health insurance policy , and they had to prepare powers of attorney , which they would not need had they been able to marry			1
they also sold their home and put their new one in @entity12 's name to avoid future problems			2
although their exact rights have not yet been defined , when @entity161 was defeated they knew it was time to get married - and devised their plan			2
' had the @entity132 made this decision one year ago , this would 've been as simple as us taking a trip because i could still walk , ' @entity11 said ahead of the marriage			1
' it 's the progression for me of the @entity33 , it 's just compounded everything			0
i do n't live in a world of regret but i sure wish we were a year in the past			0
' next year , residents of @entity8 will most likely be able to vote on whether to repeal the 2004 ban on gay marriage .			2

@entity11 and @entity12 , both 47 , married earlier this month after @entity161 was struck down by the @entity132
now a federal judge has granted them a temporary restraining order against the 2004 @entity8 law banning recognition of their marriage
the victory has added significance as @entity11 is close to death
his death certificate will now show he was married and that husband @entity12 is his surviving spouse
the pair will also be able to be buried next to each other in @entity11 's family plot - which only allowed for spouses to be buried there
