by @entity0 published : 04:25 est , 1 september 2012 updated : 16:29 est , 1 september 2012 for hardened criminals that have spent a lifetime trying to evade the police , politely offering to get the @entity2 might not come naturally			0
but that 's exactly what inmates from @entity9 and @entity10 will soon be doing when they swap their overalls for aprons and sharp suits to work at a new restaurant inside the high security @entity10 jail			0
you might expect an eatery run by prisoners to serve up stodgy dishes , but the aptly named @entity23 restaurant will provide high quality food in a fine - dining environment			1
the diner will be the second of its kind to be launched in the @entity47 following the opening of @entity23 at @entity49 in @entity50 three years ago			0
employees at the new restaurant in @entity10 will all be criminals who are all close to their release date with no drug addiction or anger management issues			0
@entity56 - formerly a chef at @entity58 in @entity60 's @entity59 , which was once owned by @entity61 , cooked up the concept and is the man behind the @entity65 venture			1
talking about why he decided to embark on the new scheme @entity68 , who will be assisted by head chef @entity69 , said he wanted to help prisoners stand on their own two feet again after their release			1
he said : ' once the prisoners come to prison they 've committed a crime			1
garnish : head chef , @entity69 , left , and director of operations , @entity68 , right , put the finishing touches on some of the new dishes prisoners will be serving up haute cuisine : the meals on the menu are more @entity84 than prison gruel ' if it was your son would you prefer that he was banged up , beaten , treated with disrespect , treated inhumanely ? ' as far as i 'm concerned he 's in prison , he 's lost his freedom and he has to do what he 's told 24 hours a day and that 's his punishment			1
' if he has no qualifications , if he has no prospects , when he is released if they have no job , no family , no accommodation , no qualifications the likelihood is they are going to come back			0
we 're trying to break that cycle			0
' it 's a very short - term view to say get them in , bang them up , treat them bad , they wo n't come back			1
if they have no other choice , no other means of finding a job , of supporting themselves , the chances are they will come back			0
' prisoners will earn £ 14 for a 40 - hour week , working five days a week , 52 weeks of the year , with no holiday			1
they must return to their respective jails at the end of every shift and only inmates with between six to 18 months left on their jail terms qualify for the project			0
fine dining : appropriately named @entity23 restaurant , left , includes dishes such as @entity126 with squid in tomato and garlic sauce served with seasoned salad on the menu , right the goal of the restaurant is to reduce the chances of re-offending as 74 per cent of prisoners with no job or accommodation currently commit another crime within a year			1
the results of the restaurant in @entity50 show a dramatic impact on this with only 10 per cent of those who have worked at the diner reoffending within a year			2
in addition to providing a new employment route after leaving jail the @entity23 charity also assists prisoners with things like cvs and disclosure forms			2
the restaurant has a strict zero tolerance policy – and introduces father figures to prisoners who may never have been told off or indeed praised			2
lags of lamb : porridge is n't likely to feature on the high - class menu for @entity23 restaurant it is also hoped that providing a direct link between prisoners and the public will help to change perceptions about prisoners			1
everything at the restaurant – from full meals to biscuits and bread – is made from scratch by the prisoners			2
even the tables and chairs have been made by offenders , and the food is sourced from a prison farm at @entity9			0
the restaurant , which will open its doors on september 19 will serve breakfast and lunch between monday and friday , but initially at least will not offer alcohol			0
if the restaurant proves as successful as its forerunner in @entity50 the plan is to open two more @entity23 restaurants every year for the next four years at prisons across the country .			2

a total of 30 cateogry @entity36 prisoners will be offered jobs as chefs , waiters and cleaners
prisoners will earn £ 14 for a 40 - hour week , working 52 weeks of the year , with no holiday
