@entity0 tonight launched an extraordinary attack on @entity2 who have defected to @entity4 , claiming they were the sort of people who injure themselves having sex with vacuum cleaners			1
he swept into the @entity11 conference tonight , with senior party aides hoping he will do away with the nervous jitters caused by @entity4 defections and @entity16 's poll lead			1
the @entity18 mayor addressed a rally of conservative activists tonight , mocking @entity4 supporters and suggesting @entity22 should switch to become a conservative			1
and he mocked defectors with an extraordinary sex joke			0
he told delighted @entity11 activists : ' the @entity45 commission wants to ban vacuum cleaners on the grounds that they are too powerful			1
‘ if you do not handle your vacuum cleaner correctly , you may end up inhaling the hamster – the budgerigar through the bars of the cage			0
‘ and i have read that there are some people – probably the type who are thinking of defecting to @entity4 – who present themselves at @entity60 with barely credible injuries sustained through vacuum cleaner abuse			2
’ @entity63 is understood to be enraged by the behaviour of @entity11 mp @entity65 , who tried to derail the start of the conference by announcing he was defecting to @entity4			1
the prime minister is said to have erupted during one private reception at the conference about the mp sitting on his ‘ fat a * * * ’ and relying on activists ’ hard work to get elected , only to betray their trust			1
he was also alleged to have called mr @entity65 a ‘ d * * * h * * * ’			1
the outspoken remark is likely to infuriate @entity4 supporters , and will draw comparisons to when defence minister @entity80 said of mr @entity22 : ' i always think he looks like somebody has put their finger up his bottom and he really rather likes it			2
' standing together : @entity63 and @entity0 have both rounded on the ' quitters ' of the @entity11 party mr @entity0 pulled a remarkable face when asked what is the worse thing he has ever forgotten : he eventually recalled forgetting his mother 's birthday @entity18 mayor @entity0 waves his lanyard to photographers as he arrives at the @entity94 in @entity95 @entity11 strategists hope his arrival at the annual conference will deflect attention from the defection of two @entity11 mps to @entity4 @entity63 is expected to pose for photographs with his old friend - and leadership rival - in an attempt to show he is one of the ' stars in the team '			1

' it is be the first time he has addressed the conference since announcing his plan to stand for election to @entity115 in 2015			0
mr @entity0 said : ' i say to those who made headlines in the last few days – the quitters , and the splitters and the kippers – there ’s only one party that ’s going to sort out the @entity125 issue and there ’s only one party that ’s going to sort out the constitutional anomaly that allows @entity130 mps to vote on matters that only affect @entity132 when @entity132 @entity129 have no corresponding say over questions in @entity130			0
' there ’s only one party and there ’s only one leader in our country who is going to sort that out and that is @entity63 , ' mr @entity0 added			0
mr @entity0 also said he held a pub meeting with mr @entity22 around 20 years ago when he was given ' vodka and caviar ' and asked to defect			0
he added : ‘ i said “ no , @entity22 , you join us ”			0
i repeat my message today , because it is only the conservatives who are able to deliver the kind of things he is talking about and it is only if the great conservative family unites and we stop @entity155 seizing back control of this country that we will be able to deliver the referendum that this country wants and deserves			0
’ mr @entity0 was cheered into the hall in the @entity11 conference in @entity95 this evening the @entity18 mayor 's address to conference delegates comes in the wake of two @entity11 mps defecting to @entity4 the mayor 's speech , which got a standing ovation , came amid growing concern that more eurosceptic @entity11 @entity129 are planning to defect to @entity4			1

mr @entity65 's defection , sparking a by - election in the @entity181 seat of @entity182 and @entity183 , was the first of two blows for the prime minister at the start of this week 's @entity11 conference in @entity95			1

@entity4 leader @entity22 said the party was in talks with more mps to defect after @entity65 left the @entity2 on saturday @entity177 became the first conservative to defect to @entity4 last month , sparking speculation that up to eight @entity129 were considering leaving the party he has already given his fulsome backing to chancellor @entity201 , who used his speech to conference at lunchtime to announce £ 25billion in spending cuts , including £ billion from freezing benefits for two years			1
speaking during a visit to a factory in @entity208 on his way to the conference , @entity18 mayor @entity0 said : ' if you want to have the cash to pay for the whole of society , then you need the economy to be going gang - busters			1
' the most important thing for us in the @entity220 economy is you 've got to reform welfare and it 's quite right that you should be looking at ways of improving how it 's spent , but you 've got to get the economy moving because that 's the way to pay for the whole she - bang			0
' earlier mr @entity0 tried his hand at making bricks during a visit to @entity230 - under - @entity231 he spent some time closely inspecting rows of unfired brick ready for cutting during a visit to @entity235 the mayor even made , and signed , a brick which was then fired at the factory mr @entity0 has been selected as the @entity11 candidate for @entity240 and @entity241 - a safe @entity11 seat - and hopes to return to government when his term as mayor ends in 2016			1

he told @entity249 's @entity248 show : ' he 's got to finish his term as mayor of @entity18			2
i know that 's what he wants to do and i believe you can be a member of parliament and mayor of @entity18 and do a very effective job			2
' but once he 's finished that , then you know he 's a star and , as i 've always said , i want to have the stars in the team			0
' @entity0 laid out a challenge to @entity63 in a rallying cry to @entity11 voters making clear that he had no problem with @entity220 leaving the @entity45			1
he said it was up to the prime minister to ‘ deliver real change in @entity125 ’ – including controls on @entity45 immigration			1
mr @entity0 said it was important to ‘ sort out our relations with @entity125 ’			0
@entity0 today claimed it would be ' easy ' to leave the @entity45 and sign up to a free trade agreement he said : ‘ we all want reform			2
we want sensible control of the number of people coming in			0
it is the right and the duty of every state to have some idea of how many people want to settle in its boundaries , what jobs they propose to do there and how much it is going to cost its local authorities			0
’ the @entity18 mayor ’s remarks come amid growing embarrassment within the @entity11 hierarchy over the government ’s failure to cut net migration – which is back above 200,000 a year			1
mr @entity63 pledged to slash net migration to ‘ tens of thousands ’ a year			0
the @entity18 mayor – who is the @entity11 candidate in @entity240 and @entity241 – also said it would be ‘ easy ’ for @entity220 to leave the @entity45 but stay in a free trade zone			1
he said the single biggest problem which eurosceptics had to allay about leaving the @entity45 was ‘ the anxieties of international investors into this country ’			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ in an ideal situation what i would like to see is a reformed @entity45 where we remain squarely at the heart [ of the @entity45 ]			2
’ but he said : ‘ if we could n’t remain in the current @entity45 we would remain within that free trade zone			2
‘ i think it would be very easy to set up a free - trade , tariff free zone – so for international investors they would have that reassurance			0
‘ it ’s perfectly possible to construct a vision for this country , where we do better and better on our wits , on our fantastic ability to innovate			0
’ he added : ‘ the @entity45 as a percentage of global gdp has declined over the past 20 years – from about 29 per cent to about 19 per cent			2
it ’s going down and down and down – as the potential target for our exports , that does n’t mean it is not incredibly important			0
‘ what i am trying to argue , we could remain on either view in the single market and it would be absolutely insane and self - destructive of the other major nations to want to kick us out			0
’ he said it was ‘ up to use and up to @entity63 to deliver a real change in @entity125 ’			1
