by @entity0 published : 05:04 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 05:36 est , 1 june 2012 this is the tear - jerking moment a two - year - old deaf boy hears his mother 's voice for the first time			2
the adorable @entity7 child has just been fitted with a hearing aid , and his sheer joy at every sound is beautiful to watch			1
the youngster , addressed only as @entity12 by a woman out of shot , squeals with happiness as he listens to his mother say his name			0
with one hand constantly returning to the ear to which the device is fitted , the boy gurgles merrily and taps building blocks together			2
an incredible 1,800 viewers have ' liked ' the clip since it was posted on thechive.com			0
a typical comment reads : ' i started smiling even before i saw the clip ... amazing ! ' there has been a surge of such clips in recent years as scientists have developed ever more ingenious ways of helping deaf people to hear			0
many are given surgically implanted cochlear implants , which provide a sense of sound to people who are deaf or severely hard of hearing and are often referred to as ' bionic ears '			0
what 's this ? the boy is amazed at the magical capabilities of his new hearing aid last october , a video of an eight - month - old baby hearing for the first time using the electronic implant went viral , with viewers describing the moment as ' magical '			1
another moving video showed 29 - year - old @entity63 hearing fully for the first time using the implant			1
the @entity7 woman , who had been wearing hearing aids from the age of two but was only able to hear very quiet noises , was able to talk about it to a fascinated world			1
one day , perhaps a little later than his peers , @entity12 will be able to speak and tell the world what it is like to hear after spending the first two years of your life in silence .			0
