by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it may not have been a tie that had supporters licking their lips with anticipation , but for the 300 @entity8 fans who did turn up to their pre-season friendly with @entity10 in @entity11 certainly got their fair share of entertainment			2
a change of kick - off time and venue would usually be more than enough drama for one afternoon , but when opposition supporters proceed to throw beer cans and fire crackers on the pitch at half - time then you know it is an unusual game of football			1
@entity10 supporters withdrew banners and then were promptly kicked out of the @entity28 venue when they threw beer cans and fire crackers on to the pitch at half - time			1
but the reason for @entity10 's frustrations was down to their captain @entity72 , who was dismissed for hurtling towards the referee from 15 yards and pushing him to the ground			2
he refused to leave the field , however , and @entity10 proceeded to bring on another player to even up the numbers without the referee noticing			0
@entity80 played for several minutes before the officials noticed and asked him to leave the field of play			0
amazingly , before kick - off the tie was switched from @entity87 ' athletics ground after shot put damage forced the pitch to be deemed unplayable			1
the venue switch also caused a 30 - minute delay to the start of the match , something which further frustrated @entity10 fans			1
@entity8 eventually won the match 2 - 1			0
victory : hearts did manage to win the pre-season friendly 2 - 1 despite all the distractions			0

@entity10 fans threw firecrackers and beer bottles on to pitch at half - time
they were *ejected* but tried to scale perimeter fences to get back in
@entity61 ' captain sent off for running at referee during match
@entity10 brought on another man to replace him until referee noticed
match moved from @entity87 ' athletics ground *due* to damage caused by shot put *competition*
kick - off was delayed by 30 minutes as a result of venue switch
