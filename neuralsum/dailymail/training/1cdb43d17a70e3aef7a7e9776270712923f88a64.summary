by @entity0 published : 13:00 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:50 est , 20 february 2014 @entity3 claims : the officer who arrested @entity5 has experienced significant disciplinary proceedings over the course of the past 11 - years the @entity10 police officer who arrested @entity5 last month for drag racing has been accused of misconduct 15 - times in the past , it has been revealed today			1
officer @entity13 , who claims that @entity5 , 19 , was racing at 60 mph long the beach strip last month , has a checkered history that the popstar 's lawyers hope will help their clients case should it go to trial			1
indeed , @entity5 's legal counsel are now working under the assumption that @entity13 's claims may even be false - as indicated by claims that the gps tracking system from the star 's @entity26 shows that in the middle of the alleged race , the maximum top speed of the cars was 27 mph			1
according to celebrity gossip site , @entity33 , @entity13 has been investigated by internal affairs repeatedly and has been cited for misconduct 15 times from 2001 to 2012			1
out of the 15 times he was accused of misconduct , @entity13 failed to show up for court hearings 5 times			1
and in each of those cases he was reprimanded , with three verbal warnings and two write ups			0
in 2006 , @entity13 committed three offenses , which violated the rules of ' courtesy and respect ' , ' off - duty / secondary employment ' and ' unlawful compensation			2
' he was suspended for these violations			0
watch video here : off the hook ? @entity5 's defense team hope that the questionable record of officer @entity13 will mean the case does not come to trial and in 2007 , @entity13 was accused of offensive conduct and language and this allegation is still open according to @entity33			1
and , embarrassingly , in 2011 , @entity13 was cited for sleeping while on duty			0
and out of the seven remaining cases , @entity13 was exonerated by @entity63			2
last month , according to @entity33 , who claim to have obtained the print - out of the gps records from the @entity68 had rented and was driving at the time of his arrest in @entity10 last week , the records would have shown a higher driving speed if the 19 - year - old had been drag racing his friend @entity75 , as police initially claimed			1
@entity10 police primarily accused @entity5 and @entity75 of racing at speeds of between 50 and 60 miles an hour			1
however , judging by the @entity33 print - out , the maximum speed reached by @entity5 in the car was 44mph , which was when he left @entity84 in @entity10 at 4.07am , before the speed dropped to a maximum speed of 27mph just two minutes later			2
the website claim that the significance behind the figures is that the 27mph reading came on the 3700 block of @entity92 - where the speed limit is 30mph - and that if @entity5 had been drag racing at that point , the reading would have been significantly higher			1
police had originally claimed they caught sight of the drag race on the 2600 block of the road , before @entity5 was pulled over and arrested in the 4100 block			2
there are also discrepancies in the gps reading from the @entity106 which was reported to have been used to block traffic on @entity92 to allow the drag race to take place			0
watch video here : location : police had originally claimed they caught sight of the drag race on the 2600 block of @entity92 ( pictured ) before @entity5 was pulled over and arrested in the 4100 block however , the print - out of the gps show that the vehicle originally stopped outside the club at 2.35am , when @entity5 and his dad , who was in the @entity106 , headed inside and remained for 1.2 hours			1
the vehicle is n't registered to have begun moving again until 4.06am , and did n't stop until @entity5 was pulled over - dismissing claims that it was used to facilitate the race			2
@entity33 claim that if the gps records are correct , the figures will cause issues for prosecutors in the case , as it will mean that @entity5 's car was pulled over for a reason that does n't actually exist			1
involved : gps records from the @entity106 that @entity5 's dad @entity129 ( pictured ) was in also refutes claims that the vehicle had been parked up to facilitate the drag race regardless of the gps records , official toxicology reports from @entity5 's arrest show that the singer had marijuana and the active ingredient of @entity138 in his system when he was arrested on january 23rd			1
the star is pleading not guilty to @entity141 after the arrest			0
meanwhile , in the latest alleged criminal episode earlier this week , @entity5 and five of his entourage are accused of assaulting a limousine driver on december 30 after they were picked up from a nightclub			2
@entity150 police released a statement saying the limo driver and an unnamed passenger had an altercation during which he was hit on the back of the head ' several times '			0
the charge is yet another in a string of recent run - ins with the law , but if @entity5 is convicted of assault , federal law allows that the @entity165 could very well be deported and banned from working in the @entity166			0
meanwhile , former @entity168 star @entity167 is the latest person to offer @entity5 some advice in the wake of his difficult few weeks			0
speaking to @entity171 on the @entity172 , @entity167 said : ' things do n't really change much , do they ? if you 're a teenage idol and all the young girls love you , you can lose that pretty quick			0
' you can lose perspective , but you can also lose them in the long run if you 're not a role model			0
hopefully , what he does on stage and the way he dances and the way he sings , he will apply that to his real life			0
' there 's a discipline in what he 's doing			0
apply that discipline to how you want to behave			0

@entity10 officer who collared @entity5 for drag racing under the influence of *alcohol* has a checkered professional record
officer @entity13 has faced 15 charges of misconduct over an 11 - year period
he was exonerated seven times
@entity5 's defense team believe this casts doubts on the *authenticity* of @entity13
upon his arrest , police had accused @entity5 of racing at speeds of between 50 and 60mph
gps records show that could not be the case
