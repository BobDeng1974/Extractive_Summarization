@entity1 manager @entity0 is promising an exciting summer of recruitment at @entity4 after the club effectively guaranteed their @entity7 survival with a comeback victory at @entity9			1
@entity1 are now 11 points clear of the drop zone and @entity0 can think about building for next season , buoyed by the new @entity14 deal and a possible takeover from @entity17 businessman @entity16			1
recruitment is now uppermost in @entity0 ’s mind and he revealed : ‘ we are getting calls regarding players from @entity22 and @entity23 because they are our market now			1
@entity0 's @entity1 came from behind to beat @entity9 2 - 1 at the @entity25 @entity0 ( left ) congratulates wing wizard @entity26 at full - time after @entity1 's impressive victory @entity29 has scored in his last two games against @entity31 and @entity9 , the first time he ’s netted consecutively since october 2012 in his first spell with @entity1 ‘ @entity1 now come into the same group as everybody below the likes of @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , and the most important thing is to try to trade well			1
‘ it ’s important to preserve your @entity7 status early			1
if you leave it late , it is very difficult to get players			2
you do n’t want other teams putting packages together and working on players before you can			2
‘ we are pretty secure in approaching clubs and players now as a @entity7 side for next season and that ’s what we will do			1
we have the finance to do what we say we are going to do			0
so it does give us a slight advantage			0
’ one player who will remain is reborn winger @entity29 who scored the winner at @entity62 for his first back - to - back goals since 2012			1
in february , @entity29 ( right ) was sad , but according to @entity0 he is now playing with a smile @entity65 signed for @entity66 after @entity1 's promotion , but his career nosedived at @entity69 @entity65 ’s career nosedived after a £ 15million move to @entity66 went sour and he has gone from being capped by @entity72 to not even making the under 21 squad			1
he was ordered to smile more and sulk less by @entity0 last week and celebrated his goal at @entity9 by playfully sticking out his tongue			1
‘ he looked a sad player when i arrived ( from @entity77 in january ) , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ you are never going to play your best football when you 're sad and sometimes good management is not about tactics but inspiring players			2
he was down in the dumps for whatever reason			2
‘ @entity86 players need that exuberance , particularly with the way he plays			2
and smiling and being happy is part of that exuberance			0
’ nonetheless , 22 - year - old @entity65 does n’t plan on transforming himself into a cartoon clown			2
‘ i do smile when i need to ! , ’ he stressed			2
@entity1 players celebrate with @entity94 after he scored a penalty to draw @entity1 level @entity9 manager @entity97 was distraught with two key decisions by referee @entity99 ‘ when it is time to be serious , i ’m serious			1
when it is time to play around i will play around			0
‘ we ’ve got the points we ’ve needed to now so we can play without pressure and enjoy the rest of the season			0
’ there was n’t much hilarity from beaten @entity9 manager @entity97 who felt his side were robbed by two key decisions from referee @entity99 after taking a 14th - minute lead from @entity113			1
@entity97 has joined @entity115 manager @entity114 in saying technology should be brought in immediately to stop the wrong decisions being made			0
the @entity9 boss was furious that mr @entity99 awarded @entity1 a penalty when @entity120 and @entity26 collided and @entity94 levelled from the spot			1
and after @entity65 had put @entity1 ahead , the official waved away a strong appeal for handball against @entity1 defender @entity125			2
@entity97 believes that @entity1 defender @entity125 ( right ) was guilty of handball in the penalty area @entity97 slammed the standard of refereeing in the @entity7 this season @entity97 said : ‘ it was clear to everybody that he has thrown his body , his arms to stop the ball going goalwards			1
it was a shot on target , he was not close to the ball , he was about five yards away so it was a clear penalty			0
‘ i do n’t think the standard of refereeing this year has been as good as it needs to be			0
they need a little bit of help and i ’m an advocate of tv replays			0
‘ i think it is quite simple			0
if a big decision is made , he needs to ask the question : is there any reason why i should not give a penalty , or why i should not give a goal			0
within 10 or 15 seconds they can give the referee an answer and there will be more correct decisions			0
they need to be given that option because at the moment they need a lot more help			0
‘ i think we have reached a tipping point			0
before there were debates one way or the other but now i think it needs to come in			0
