@entity0 has threatened to stand for election to the @entity2 over @entity4 ’s ‘ lies ’ about the @entity5			1
the former prime minister said he would make a dramatic return to frontline politics north of the border to tackle the @entity11 head on			1
his announcement prompted speculation that the former prime minister – who would be a significant figure compared to the those currently representing @entity16 in @entity17 – might even seek to succeed mr @entity4 as @entity17 ’s leader			1
the former prime minister , who is still an mp in @entity19 , said : ‘ i say this to mr @entity4 himself			1
if he continues to peddle this deception then i will want to join @entity23 in fighting him and securing the return of a @entity25 as quickly as possible			1
he even won praise from his old enemy @entity36 this week for ‘ catalysing ’ agreement on a rapid timetable for the devolution of more powers to the parliament in @entity29			2
mr @entity0 will be 65 by the time of the next @entity17 parliament elections in 2016			1
he has insisted he intends to stand in the @entity44 next year , but it is still possible to run in @entity29 elections while remaining an mp at @entity19			0
mr @entity0 ’s surprise threat came as he launched a bid to shore up support for the @entity50 among @entity17 pensioners			1
a @entity53 poll released last night showed the over 65s were overwhelmingly planning to vote ‘ no ’ – by 57 per cent to just 36 per cent in favour			0
mr @entity0 said @entity16 would not devolve @entity17 pensions to @entity30 – because they were safer under the protection of the @entity58			1
but he said mr @entity4 ’s claim that the @entity5 was in danger from @entity61 were bogus because the health service was already controlled by @entity29			1
mr @entity0 also vowed to hand further tax raising powers for the @entity64 to increase funding for the health service			1
he added that if mr @entity4 continued to claim that @entity16 was a threat to the @entity5 he would stand for office in @entity17			1
the revelation that mr @entity0 was prepared to move his political career to @entity30 overshadowed his pitch to pensioners to vote against independence			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ the nationalists want you to believe that if an @entity77 prime minister sought to privatise the @entity5 in @entity17 or cut its budget , @entity17 would be powerless to prevent this from happening			1
‘ they want you to believe that the @entity2 is powerless to act to safeguard our @entity5			0
if mr @entity0 returned to front - line politics in @entity29 it would mark a dramatic resurrection of his career after leaving @entity85 in 2010 ‘ they want you to conclude that separation is the only answer if you care about the @entity5			1
this is a nationalist deception – a claim that does not stand up to the evidence and that is not supported by the facts			0
‘ what the nationalists do n’t tell you is that the @entity17 health service can not be privatised by @entity19 because all decisions about our nhs are made here in @entity17			0
the @entity2 , created by @entity16 in 1998 , has full control over our health service			0
‘ what the nationalists also do n’t tell you is that they are not powerless to fund the @entity5			0
under the @entity106 , they already had the power to raise an extra £ 1,000 million in tax to help pay for the @entity5 in @entity17			2
‘ had they wanted to use it , the @entity11 could have raised the @entity17 healthcare budget from £ 12 billion to £ 13 billion			2
‘ the @entity2 has all the powers it needs to fund the @entity5 in @entity17			2
’ he added : ‘ it is time to nail the nationalist lie			0
’ he said : ‘ do you think that i or anyone else who cares about the @entity5 would let it be privatised in @entity17 or have its funds cut – without a fight ? ‘ would we stand back and do nothing without ensuring that there were laws in place to guarantee that the @entity5 could not be privatised in @entity17 or see its funding cut without our permission ? ’ he also attacked mr @entity4 for rejecting the latest warnings that big businesses would move their headquarters to @entity77 in the event of a @entity131 vote next week			1
paraphrasing a quote attributed to @entity133 , he said : ‘ i say to @entity4 : you can try to dismiss some of the warnings some of the time but you can not dismiss all of the warnings all of the time			0
’ but @entity11 leader mr @entity4 insisted @entity17 was on the ‘ cusp of making history ’ by voting for independence in a week 's time			1
vowing that @entity17 ‘ will vote yes ’ in seven days ' time , he attacked the no camp for being in ‘ terminal decline ’ the day after the leaders of three main @entity146 parties travelled north of the border in a bid to save the union			0
mr @entity4 said : ‘ @entity17 is on the cusp of making history			2
the eyes of the world are upon @entity17			0
and what the world is seeing is an articulate , peaceful , energised debate			0
‘ @entity17 will vote yes next thursday and they will vote yes because last minute , cobbled up promises from the no campaign which unravel at the slightest scrutiny will not fool anyone in this country and neither will the blatant bullying and intimidation of the @entity58			0
‘ the no campaign is in terminal decline			0
in contrast a @entity131 vote is the opportunity of a lifetime			0
an opportunity to build a fairer more prosperous country			0
’ the latest @entity53 poll for the @entity173 puts support for the union at 53 per cent and backing for independence on 47 per cent , when undecided voters are excluded			0
last night an unprecedented list of 200 health workers – including porters , nurses , gps and the country ’s top consultants – signed a letter warning that independence is a ‘ great risk ’ to the @entity5			0
the open letter to the @entity190 stated : ‘ patients from @entity17 can access the care they need anywhere in the @entity146			0
@entity194 would , at best , put them at the back of the @entity196 accused the @entity131 campaign of peddling lies about the @entity5			2
the @entity199 today released independent analysis undermining mr @entity4 ’s claim that independence was necessary to protect the @entity5			1
the respected economic think tank said health was already a devolved matter			0
the @entity199 also revealed that mr @entity4 had spent less on health than the @entity207 in @entity19			1
it said : ‘ this means the @entity5 does not have to make more use of private sector providers just because the @entity210 is ( and indeed , it has n’t been )			0
‘ and the @entity17 government decides how much money to allocate to the @entity5 from the overall block grant it receives from @entity19			2
to a significant extent then , the future of the @entity5 is already in @entity17 hands			1
’ the @entity199 added : ‘ between 2009 - 10 and 2015 - 16 spending on the @entity5 in @entity77 will , on currently announced plans , have risen by about 4 per cent in real terms despite an overall fall of 13 per cent in @entity77 departmental spending			2
‘ over the same period the vagaries of the @entity224 formula mean that @entity17 will have had to cut overall public service spending by less – by about 8 per cent rather than 13 per cent			2
‘ but the @entity17 government has chosen to protect the @entity5 in @entity17 slightly less than it has been protected in @entity77			2
spending on the @entity5 in @entity17 has fallen by 1 per cent			2
‘ @entity17 governments in @entity29 have placed less priority on funding the @entity5 in @entity17 ( and more on funding other services ) than governments in @entity19 have for @entity77			1

former prime minister said he would not tolerate @entity11 ' lies ' about the @entity5
he said he would ' join ' @entity16 's leader in @entity17 @entity23
mr @entity0 *pledged* to fight @entity11 to secure ' return of @entity16 ' in @entity29
@entity11 has cut funding for the @entity5 by more than the @entity207 , figures reveal
@entity199 said ' @entity5 is already in @entity17 hands '
