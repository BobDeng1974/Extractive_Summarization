by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 13:20 est , 19 october 2012 the @entity2 translation was only released on wednesday			1
but already the @entity4 erotic novel @entity3 has become the fastest selling book in @entity2 publishing history			1
the astonishing sales figures - of around 75,000 every day - come after the book was panned by @entity2 critics as ' crass pseudo-porn ' that reads like a @entity12 novel			1
one high - brow reviewer even wrote : ' it 's as close to literature as @entity17 cat food is to gastronomy			1
' but despite the torrent of critical abuse , the ' mummy porn ' bestseller by @entity21 has now overtaken the @entity25 novels as @entity2 's favorite book			1
@entity2 high street giant @entity27 said copies of the novel had been ' flying of the shelves '			1

we have never stocked a book that has sold so fast			0
' we sold 15,000 copies on the day it was released			0
in some shops there were just none left			0
' but the scathing views of of critics from major newspapers and magazines have not matched the huge popularity of @entity2 's latest publishing phenomenon			1

' author @entity21 posing with the @entity72 version of @entity3 in @entity73 news magazine @entity74 wrote : ' the female character 's multiple orgasms are laughably unbelievable			2
this crass , pseudo porn might prove to be a massive boost to the sex toy industry , but it 's got nothing to do with good writing			0
' this may be what pleases the @entity4 public , who can identify with the character @entity88 's conflict between her " conscience " and her " inner goddess " , but it remains to be seen if the @entity2 will regard the book with anything more than curiosity			2
' some couples may say it has helped their sex lives by reading it , but it 's as close to literature as @entity17 cat food is to gastronomy			2
' and the 20 minutes news website added : ' it 's a load of @entity12 - style rubbish			0
' meanwhile , the @entity2 publisher @entity106 has already ordered 500,000 copies - one of the biggest print runs of any @entity2 publishing house in recent years			0
