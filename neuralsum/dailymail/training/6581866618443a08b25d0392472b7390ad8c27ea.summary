troubled @entity1 rock star @entity0 has checked out of his rehab clinic in @entity3 after apparently beating his heroin addiction - despite twisted ' fans ' even sending him heroin by post			1
the 35 - year - old @entity9 and @entity10 frontman – who was consuming an astonishing 3.5 grams of heroin a day before seeking rehab in the @entity12 in october – is now drug - free and recording with band mates in a studio at a secret beach location in @entity3			1

in a video shared exclusively with @entity27 , the musician gives a guided tour of the centre			2
pointing to a fighter plane parked in the grounds of @entity32 , he tells the camera : ' i had this specifically brought in , just in case i need to evacuate in an emergency			0
' but we could n't move the chocks , so i got the bikes instead			0
@entity0 , who went out with @entity69 , checked out of the rehab centre run by recovered addict @entity71 at @entity72 after a programme involving a combination of methadone , counselling , exercise and intense therapy			1
at least one fan tried to send @entity79 in the post			2
' @entity0 has a hard core of fans and followers and they are not all healthy minded , ' said @entity71 , who runs @entity32 with his @entity3 wife @entity85			1
' he received a lot of fan mail which we searched before handing it over			0
sadly , on two occasions , we intercepted drugs we had to destroy			0
it sickened me that there are such disgusting people out there who would go to such lengths to sabotage his treatment			0
' both packages were posted in @entity101 – one arriving two weeks into his stay at @entity32 and the second at @entity72 just before @entity0 left			2
it is not known if the same person sent both packages			0
' when i threw the second package into the fire , i could smell the familiar stench of burning heroin , something i had n't experience since i stopped using it myself 12 years ago , ' said @entity71			0
' whoever did this has a warped mind			0
' on another occasion , @entity71 said , one male fan tried to climb over the wall of the rehab centre to visit @entity0 but was chased away			1
one client , meanwhile , became so obsessed with @entity0 he had to be forcibly discharged and was later arrested and deported			2
band mates : @entity0 ( left ) has signed a deal with @entity63 along with former band mate @entity64 ( right ) tour : pointing to a fighter plane parked in the grounds of @entity32 , @entity0 said : ' i had this specifically brought in , just in case i need to evacuate in an emergency			1
but we could n't move the chocks , so i got the bikes instead ' hope rehab : in a video shared exclusively with @entity27 , the musician gives a guided tour of the centre in video interviews with counsellors shared exclusively with @entity27 by @entity32 , @entity0 – whose career has been blighted by drug abuse and scandal – speaks frankly about his fight against addiction and his sense of pride at writing and performing songs while sober			1
he wrote songs in a @entity151 - era fighter plane parked in the grounds of @entity32 which overlooks a stretch of quiet coastline 90 minutes south of @entity154 , on a plot of land provided by the former head of @entity3 's @entity158 , dr @entity157			1
@entity71 said he was impressed by @entity0 's determination to conquer his heroin habit and said he had never known a client check into rehab with such a heavy drug habit – 3.5 grams of heroin a day			1
in video interviews with counsellors shortly before he checked out , @entity0 - looking plump compared to his previous emaciated appearance – said he realised drugs had crippled his creativity and said he felt ' blessed ' to have survived addiction			1
album deal : @entity64 ( above ) and @entity0 ( below ) will record the first new album by @entity9 for a decade troubled : the career of @entity0 ( centre ) as been blighted by drug abuse and scandal			1
he is pictured here in 2009 being led away from court where he was due to stand trial for driving offences dishevelled : @entity0 now looks healthy , but older photographs of him reveal a darker side to his life ' @entity184 before drugs , it was music that would raise my spirits or just make me want to live or believe in something , ' he said			2
' it 's a great new drug , being clean			1
it 's not really a drug at all – it 's finding myself			2
' drugs do n't make you more creative and one of the great things about being clean is that i 'll be able to fulfill that side of things ( my creativity ) … i feel as if something inside me is shifting			0
' it is almost against my better judgment			0
but my better judgment has got me in ( trouble ) more often than not			0
when i follow what i know is true in my heart , that 's when things turn out right			0
' the wayward singer has struggled with his addictions for the past decade and has been in and out of rehab as far back as 2004			0
he was first arrested for possessing @entity211 substances in october 2005 and was eventually jailed in 2008 after a string of brushes with the law for drugs and driving offences			0
@entity0 was plunged into further controversy after a picture of him allegedly forcing his pet cat to inhale from a crack pipe appeared on the front page of @entity222 in 2007			2
his first stint in rehab came after he was released from prison for burgling the home of former @entity9 bandmate @entity64 in 2003			0
he was sentenced to six months in prison which was later cut to two on appeal and the singer lasted just three days at a treatment centre			0
during his second rehab attempt in 2012 , @entity0 was thrown out after less than three weeks because staff at @entity234 , in @entity235 , @entity3 , deemed him a ' disruptive influence '			1
rehab : @entity71 ( right in left photo ) and @entity85 ( left ) started the @entity1 - run @entity22 in @entity24 where @entity0 has spoken on camera about his battle with addiction the @entity9 : the 35 - year - old frontman was consuming 3.5 grams of heroin a day before seeking rehab although he is now out of rehab , @entity0 continues to travel to @entity32 to attend drug counselling meetings and has made arrangements to be accompanied by a @entity32 counsellor when he goes back on tour with @entity9			1
he has also launched a @entity250 to fund treatment for addicts unable to afford treatment which will be supported in part by proceeds from gigs and record sales and by public donations			1
@entity259 , head counsellor at @entity32 , said @entity0 had achieved his longest drug - free period since his teens while at the rehab centre in @entity263 – but warned that the months ahead will be challenging as he returns to the limelight			1
' we saw @entity0 grow over the course of his treatment at @entity32 , which was reflected in his new found interest in nature , spirituality and positive creativity , ' he said			1
' @entity0 has a one off slip during the course of his treatment which served to help him understand how vulnerable he is in the outside world			2
' after conquering a long and difficult detox it was wonderful to see the real @entity0 emerge with colour and a smile to his face , instead of a wasted , sweaty yellow jaundice pin cushion			2
' @entity0 's one relapse into heroin use came when he went to @entity154 in early december for a short break from @entity32 , which allows its clients to come and go freely			1
@entity259 warned : ' we are painfully aware that of the pressures he will be going out into the world with			0
' the expectations on him are massive , possibly even unreasonable and unrealistic			0
i really wonder how he is going to maintain his recovery with so many people pulling at him from every direction			0
' details of the initiative and the @entity22 are available at @entity295			0
