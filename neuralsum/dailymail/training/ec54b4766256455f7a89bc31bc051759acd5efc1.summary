his family are suing the @entity5 for negligence the family of one of six @entity9 murdered by a mob in @entity3 is suing the @entity5 for up to £ 250,000			1
it follows a landmark ruling by the @entity13 last month that @entity15 soldiers in war zones are covered by human rights laws			1
corporal @entity1 was one of the @entity18 cornered and slaughtered by hundreds of locals at a police station in @entity21 , near @entity22 , in june 2003			1
the killers have never been brought to justice			2
legal papers lodged on behalf of @entity27 ’s family allege commanders failed to take ‘ reasonable ’ measures to keep the @entity9 safe when they were deployed to the hostile town			0
the families of all six soldiers have long maintained the soldiers ’ deaths were preventable			0
they claim commanders failed to give the @entity9 sufficient ammunition to defend themselves as well as roadworthy vehicles and effective communications to call in support			0
an inquest into their deaths in 2006 recorded a verdict of unlawful killing and heard evidence the soldiers had too little ammunition , old radios and no satellite phone when they were ambushed			0
if the @entity1 family claim is successful , it could lead to yet more legal action against the @entity5 @entity53 , father of corporal @entity54 who was also killed in the attack , said he too will sue			1
‘ it could be classed as a blunt sword , but all i ’ve wanted is to get these people into court and for the @entity5 to accept the failings that were identified by the board of enquiry			1
‘ nothing else would give me greater satisfaction , and i know nothing will bring my amazing son back , but if we could get that justice and admission @entity71 ( back row , second from left ) and his comrades were killed when an angry mob of 500 stormed a police station where they were training local police in @entity3 of guilt , my wife and i could turn the chapter and pick up the threads of the life we once had			1
’ ‘ if we could get that justice and admission of guilt , my wife and i could turn the chapter and pick up the threads of the life we once had , ’ he added			0
an @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ our thoughts remain with the families of those who lost their lives			2
however , it would be inappropriate to comment on any forthcoming legal proceedings			0
the five men who died alongside @entity27 , from @entity98 , @entity99 , were @entity101 @entity100 , sergeant @entity103 - @entity102 , corporal @entity54 , lance corporal @entity104 and corporal @entity105			2
an inquest into their deaths in 2006 recorded a verdict of unlawful killing and heard evidence the soldiers had too little ammunition , old radios and no satellite phone when they were ambushed			0
@entity53 , whose son @entity118 was killed in the attack , said he too will sue the @entity120 said : ‘ @entity118 ’s patrol should have had a satellite phone and 150 rounds of ammunition ; they were denied both , they could n’t call for help , they could n’t initiate a firefight because they did n’t have enough ammunition against a mob of 500 firing rocket - propelled grenades and @entity132 assault rifles			2
‘ can anyone imagine that situation and be totally useless under it ? all we want is an admission of guilt from the mod. i ’m so angry and very , very hurt .			0
