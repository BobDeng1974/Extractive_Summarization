hands - on : @entity1 holding his newborn son @entity2 in 2010			1
the @entity4 leader has floated plans to double the length of paternity leave and increase statutory paternity pay from £ 100 a week to £ 260 new fathers are to be offered a month of paternity leave under a £ 150million @entity4 plan to encourage them to be more hands - on with their children			1
labour leader @entity1 today promises a sharp increase in paternity pay to £ 260 - a - week – the equivalent of the minimum wage – so more working fathers can afford to take time off			1
but the plan has faced some criticism from business leaders , who warn it will cause uncertainty and staff shortages for employers , especially small firms			2
it comes after @entity4 has faced sustained criticism for being anti-business			0
but the party claimed ' good ' businesses will welcome the policy as a way to encourage both men and women to stay in work			0
mr @entity1 unveiled the ' @entity38 ' , expected to help 400,000 men a year , as part of a coordinated push of family - friendly policies			1
it includes increasing free childcare for three and four year olds from 15 to 25 hours a week and guaranteeing breakfast and after school clubs from 8am to 6pm			0
he said : ' the modern @entity49 family needs government to be more flexible in what it does to help			0
' parents work long and stressful hours , at different times of the day , and it is increasingly tough to balance this with giving our kids the best start in life they can get			0
' mr @entity1 , a father of two sons , said more and more fathers want to play a hands - on role in childcare particularly but are ' frustrated by out - dated laws and entitlements '			1
he criticised the @entity68 plan for a married couple 's tax break , which will cost £ 700million but only help one in five families with children			1
' at the heart of @entity4 's plan , is the belief that @entity49 succeeds when modern working families succeed , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' that means giving dads , as well as @entity80 , the chance to spend more time at home in the those crucial weeks after babies have been born			0
' the idea of offering fathers a month off work when they have a child was first put forward last year by the left - leaning @entity89 think tank			0
@entity4 claims it would benefit up to 400,000 families a year			0
under existing rules new fathers qualify for a statutory £ 138.18 a week , equivalent to £ 3.45 an hour for a 40 - hour week , with employers encouraged to make up the gap in the employee 's usual pay			1
only just over half of new fathers ( 55 per cent ) take it up at present			0
bringing the taxpayer - funded contribution up to minimum wage level would increase take - up to around 70 per cent , the @entity89 estimates , at a cost to the @entity104 of around £ 150 million in 2015 - 16			2
he insisted that being a father was more important than being @entity4 leader , but struggles to find time for his wife @entity125 and his family			2
appearing on @entity128 's @entity127 , he said : ' i ’ve got two young boys of four and five and the greatest pleasure in life is spending time with them and @entity125			0
' it is really hard because like many , many parents , you ’re working long hours and you become more and more aware of how important that quality time is			0
part of the thing i ’ve learnt to try and do is try and carve out that time with them , mainly obviously at weekends , but to carve out that time because i do n’t want them to think of me as a dad who was n’t around			0
' my job as leader of the @entity4 is important but my most important job is being a good dad			1
' with the party 's spending plans under close scrutiny ahead of the election , @entity4 said @entity150 figures showed its policy of extending free childcare to three and four - year - olds - paid for by a bank levy - would save ' significantly ' more in tax credits than the cost of the extra paternity pay			1
' the modern @entity49 family needs government to be more flexible in what it does to help , ' mr @entity1 said			2
' thanks to the last @entity4 government , fathers have two weeks ' paid paternity leave			1
' millions of families have benefited , with parents saying this has helped them support each other , share caring responsibilities and bond with their children			0
but the money is n't great - and too many dads do n't take up their rights because they feel they have to go back to work so they can provide for their family			0
' he pointed to the party 's weekend announcement that it would end the ' crazy ' situation of underused and mothballed sure start children 's centres by restoring an obligation on councils to provide childcare via them			0
@entity187 education secretary @entity186 said using private and charity providers would mean 50,000 new places could be laid on at no cost to the taxpayer - a claim disputed by campaigners			0
the @entity193 welcomed the commitment to restore facilities but said ' it would be short - sighted to suggest that such an initiative would not require additional funding from government '			0
@entity4 says increased paternity pay will be funded via the current tax credit budget			1
@entity4 's shadow work and pensions secretary @entity202 , who is expecting her second baby , dismissed the concerns , dismissed the concerns of business about the impact of the plan last year when the plans were floated , @entity211 executive director of policy @entity212 said : ' parental leave has changed more than five times already over the past decade , and every time it changes employers face significant adjustment costs			1
' last night @entity221 , @entity211 director general , said : ' the ' father 's month ' amounts to a tax on business			1
' although well - meaning , proposals such as this create very real costs for businesses , which can in turn lead to reduced productivity , reduced growth and fewer jobs , ' he said			2
' it also raises the spectre of a dad being off for a month , returning to work for a couple of weeks , and then asking for shared parental leave as soon as he is eligible – which could be hugely disruptive to small and mid-sized firms whose success depends on the talents and contributions of each employee			2
' but @entity4 's shadow work and pensions secretary @entity202 , who is expecting her second baby , dismissed the concerns			2
she told @entity250 's today programme : ' this is exactly what people used to say about maternity leave , that it was a big burden on businesses			2
but the reality is , what good businesses know , is that it is really important to keep women in the workplace once they have children and not let them drift off because they ca n't manage work and family life			1
that 's increasingly the case for dads			0
' ' good employers like @entity269 , @entity270 and @entity271 are already giving more than the statutory paternity leave			1
' ' what good businesses know is that unless they give that flexibility to mums and dads , they are likely to lose their best employees as they will go to a business that does value them , or they will sadly drop out of the workforce altogether			1
