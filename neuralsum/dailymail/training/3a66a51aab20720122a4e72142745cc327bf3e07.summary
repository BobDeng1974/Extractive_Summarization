by @entity0 last updated at 4:24 pm on 20th december 2011 @entity2 college football analyst @entity1 has announced he is running for the @entity3 as a @entity4 from @entity5			1
the 50 - year - old , who starred as a tailback at @entity8 and with the @entity9 in the 1980s and now appears on the cable network 's weekly game broadcasts , has been flirting with entering politics for more than year			1
@entity4 fundraiser and close friend @entity14 last night said that mr @entity1 has informed him he was running for the 2012 @entity3 seat and is in the process of dropping off his official candidate papers in @entity18			1
candidate : @entity2 college football analyst @entity1 has announced he is running for the @entity3 as a @entity4 from @entity5 mr @entity14 said : ' i think it 's great for @entity5			1
anytime you have someone with @entity1 's street smarts and business sense and willingness to serve the public , it 's a great thing			1
' mr @entity14 said he will now help raise money for mr @entity1 's political campaign			1
although mr @entity1 's name recognition could be an advantage in the race , it could also hurt him			2
he is a polarising figure who was embroiled in @entity38 's 2009 decision to fire popular football coach @entity39 over allegations the coach mistreated mr @entity1 's son , a @entity38 player , after he sustained a concussion			1
he was also a member of the record - setting @entity8 football team in the early 1980s when the program entered a series of scandals that ultimately forced the @entity48 to shut it down			1
his late entry into the @entity3 race puts him in a primary field already crowded with well - known and wealthy candidates who are vying for the seat vacated by retiring @entity4 @entity54			2
lt governor @entity55 , former @entity57 mayor @entity56 and former @entity5 solicitor general @entity58 have spent months raising money and collecting endorsements from prominent @entity4			2
the deadline to enter the race is february 1			2
mr @entity1 , who lives north of @entity57 in @entity62 , has been a board member of the influential conservative think tank the @entity64 in @entity18 and recently founded @entity65 for a @entity66 to promote conservative policies			1
he is likely banking on name recognition from his work for @entity2 and his ties to big - time college football to overcome his late start			1
but that name recognition could prove to be a double - edged sword			2
@entity38 fired mr @entity39 , who had the most wins in school history , after mr @entity1 complained to school administrators that he mistreated his son , @entity78 , by twice ordering him to stand for hours confined in a dark place after he got a concussion			2
back in the day : mr @entity1 's name recognition could be an advantage in the race , but it could also hurt him mr @entity39 denies mistreating the younger @entity84 and has said @entity1 had called coaches trying to get his son more playing time			2
mr @entity39 also said he suspects an $ 800,000 bonus he was due on december 31 , 2009 , was the reason he was fired			0
mr @entity39 sued the university and named @entity1 as a defendant			0
the case is pending before the @entity93			0
he has also sued @entity2 and a @entity57 public relations firm , accusing them of libel and slander after he was fired			1
from 1979 to 1982 , mr @entity1 was a star player at @entity8 and was part of the record - setting ' @entity99 ' backfield with @entity100			0
though the @entity102 won @entity104 championships in 1981 and 1982 , the team was also embroiled in several @entity48 investigations			0
in 1987 , the @entity48 hit @entity8 with the so - called ' death penalty ' for repeated infractions , shutting down the program for a year after finding @entity8 had continued to pay players after promising in 1985 it would stop			0
@entity8 also chose not to play in 1988 because the @entity48 would have limited the @entity102 to only seven games , none at home			0
the scandal is generally considered among the worst in college sports history			1
the sanctions levelled by the @entity48 decimated the @entity102 program and @entity8 remains the only school to be given the ' death penalty '			0
mr @entity1 was never directly implicated in the @entity48 transgressions and he has consistently denied any involvement			0
but he also has had a close relationship with @entity57 real estate developer @entity122 , one of the key boosters involved in the pay - for - play scandal			0
mr @entity122 , who reportedly insisted @entity8 had a ' payroll to meet ' even after the school promised the payments would stop , was mr @entity1 ' agent when he played in the @entity128			0
in his book @entity129 , mr @entity1 wrote : ' i 'm not going to sit here and tell you i never received a nickel during my playing days			0
' but i can say with certainty that no benefits were ever extended to me from anyone associated with the @entity8 administration			0
' after college , mr @entity1 was drafted by the @entity140 in the @entity141 and signed with the @entity9 before the 1985 season			1
he retired from football in 1989			1
as a businessman , he has been involved in ventures providing video content for the internet as well as real estate holdings and development , according to the @entity65 for a @entity66 website .			0
