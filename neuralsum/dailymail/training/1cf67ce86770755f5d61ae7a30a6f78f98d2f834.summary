workers were given the runaround at @entity2 after a swan on the runway delayed more than 20 flights			1
with planes queuing up , and an @entity9 flight dormant on the runway , this hilarious footage shows two members of staff and their efforts to snare the feathered fiend			1
the bird was not going to go quietly , and refused to be scooped up			2
the men resorted to using the car as a kind of battering ram to shepherd the feathered fiend off the runway so using a car to shunt it off the main runway , the two airport workers do their best to get services resuming at @entity24 's busiest airport			2
clapping at the swan to encourage it to fly off did not work , and it was seemingly intent on having a bit of fun on the tarmac			0
the runway was closed for around nine minutes before the swan was pinned down and taken off to @entity2 's bird hazard management team			1
the video was accompanied by a running commentary by those watching the action unfold			0
comments of ' they 're going to come round to shoot it , ' and ' they can have it for @entity42 dinner , ' add to the fun - filed episode			0
flights were queueing for around nine minutes , but @entity2 insist there were ' no delays ' the swan for all intents and purposes seems to be having a bit of fun with his supposed capturers when the video was posted on @entity56 , it led to some unsurprisingly amusing comments			1
@entity58 wrote : ' they were in a bit of a flap there , ' while @entity62 added : ' this has really brightened up my evening ! it 's just too funny			0
' the background commentary from your fellow passengers was equally entertaining			0
' the audio and visual commentary make the video seem somewhat slapstick finally the two men manage to capture the swan and normal service can resume at @entity2 a spokesperson for @entity2 told the @entity76 : ' @entity2 's bird hazard management team responded quickly and safely removed the swan to reopen the runway			1
' once rescued , the swan was taken to our animal reception centre to be properly looked after by the onsite team			0
