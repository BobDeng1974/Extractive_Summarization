by @entity0 published : 10:49 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 11:40 est , 25 january 2013 @entity2 buddies : sgt. @entity3 wanted his service dog @entity5 buried in a national cemetery and his mother is now fighting to make it happen a bomb - sniffing @entity2 dog has been denied burial in a national cemetery , despite having served nine tours of duty in @entity15			1
@entity5 , a @entity16 , was honorably discharged at age 11 with the rank of sergeant and then adopted by his brother in battle , @entity2 sgt. @entity3			1
last week , @entity5 was euthanized at 13 after suffering a debilitating lung ailment			1
as @entity3 continues his service duties , his mother @entity25 got the job of finding a proper burial for @entity5			1
@entity3 asked that @entity5 be buried in @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32			1
but when the @entity34 , @entity32 military reached out to the national cemetery about burying @entity5 , she says she was snubbed			1
' i do n't think he 's ever been asked that question before , ' @entity25 told @entity39			2
' so he was kind of like " no , we do n't do that here			2
" ' according to @entity25 , the cemetery even threw her a little attitude			2
that , she said , does n't sit well with her			2
@entity5 served three tours of duty alongside @entity3			1
the two worked as a team , with @entity5 leading @entity3 to bombs so he could disarm them			2
dangerous work that @entity25 says makes @entity5 deserving of a hero 's burial			1
' they were battle buddies , ' @entity25 said			0
' he brought my son home three times and six other people before him			0
my feeling is you need to honor him			0
' @entity25 's is a thoroughly military family			2
her father and grandparents are all buried at @entity30 and and she expects she expects both her service member sons to be buried there one day , too			0
not forgotten : @entity5 's service won her a sergeant 's rank but does n't earn her a burial in a national cemetery her dedication to the cause , then , is understandable			1
unfortunately , the animal hospital where @entity5 's remains currently reside will only keep them there for two weeks			1
so , the @entity32 mom 's one - woman grass roots campaign to get @entity5 interred at at the cemetery has also become a race against time			1
with the clock ticking , @entity25 has started a @entity85 page to spread word of her dilemma and try to move public support , and the support of @entity91 officials , in her favor			0
the page quickly gained over 500,000 ' likes			0
' @entity94 's burial : his @entity2 handler asked that @entity5 ( left ) be buried in @entity30 ( right ) but the @entity91 says that 's just not how they do things and on thursday , @entity25 even reached out to @entity100 sen. @entity99 for help			1
meanwhile , a statement from @entity103 maintains the @entity32 cemetery 's stance			2
' the @entity103 understands how much service members love and respect their dog comrades , ' the statement reads , ' they do honourable work and also serve our country			0
however , the @entity103 does not permit animals to be buried in any of our cemeteries			0
' but @entity25 is undeterred			0
with a confirmation from the @entity91 that national cemeteries will not bury animals , she is still prepared to take her fight all the way to @entity118 in spite of the odds			0
' now , they ’ve made me mad , ' she said			0
' i ’m not stopping			0
i ’m not one to quit			0

@entity2 mom determined to get @entity5 a hero 's burial
the *labrador* *retriever* died at 13 , having saved *countless* lives
