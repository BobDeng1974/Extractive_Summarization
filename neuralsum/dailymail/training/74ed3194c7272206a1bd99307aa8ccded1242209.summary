these extraordinary pictures show a @entity2 seal devouring a blue shark - one of five that it attacked and ate for dinner			1
the rare event took place off the coast of @entity8 and was witnessed and photographed by a group of shocked divers			2
the seal ate only the stomach and liver of its prey before moving on to its next victim			2
carnage : a @entity8 fur seal grabs a blue shark in its jaws as it dines on five of the deep sea predators ' it was terrible to watch , ' said @entity2 photographer @entity21 , who owns a shark diving company			1
he had been taking a group on an expedition when they found the sharks , which were all around three or four feet long ( 1.1 to 1.4 metres )			2
' suddenly a large @entity8 fur seal arrived and proceeded to catch and kill its first , then second shark , ' he said			1
it ate a further two in quick succession , before another shark drew its attention an hour later and it pounced once more			2
' this was too much for us , ' said mr @entity21			0
' we moved about three miles away			0
we certainly did not want to attract any more sharks to this seal			2
' stopping for a bite : seals compete for food with fishermen , and this one is big enough to beat its toothy target the photographer said it was the second time he has seen a seal attacking and killing a blue shark , but he has never heard anyone else describe the event			1
fur seals have sharp eyesight , keen hearing and can grow to nine feet ( 3m ) long , weighing up to 700lb ( 315kg )			1
it can live for up to 30 years , either gathering in small groups or swimming alone			0
many fur seal populations have not rebounded from extensive hunting - and now have to cope with overfishing , which can limit their prey			1
the @entity2 fur seal lives around the southern and southwestern coast of @entity61 , while the @entity63 sub-species lives in @entity64 , off @entity65 in south - east @entity63 and off @entity66			1
an @entity2 fur seal ’s diet is thought to be 70 per cent fish , 20 per cent squid and 2 per cent crab , although it will eat many other things it finds , including crustaceans , cephalopods and sometimes birds			1
@entity2 fur seals can dive as deep as 204m and for as long as 7.5 minutes			1
he suspects the seal only ate the stomach because it would have contained fish or squid , which form seal ’s preferred diet , and the liver would have been a good source of energy			1
' i guess it just ate the parts that gave it the most use , ' he said			0
the pictures come on the same day as images of a fur seal chewing on a @entity97 octopus , known locally as ' @entity98 ' , off the coast of @entity63			1
photographer @entity100 captured the rare sighting in @entity103 pier on the @entity104 , while out with a group of open - water scuba divers			0
@entity107 , a senior research scientist at the @entity109 ' @entity108 , said : ' it 's usually the other way around			0
there is a lot of footage of great whites eating seals , particularly pups who stray into their paths			0
' @entity120 normally eat fish , and the usual diet for a @entity8 fur seal would be one of two species of hake			1
' one of these species has great commercial value so the seal is in competition with fishermen when it comes to catching them			2
mr @entity107 added : ' it may be that there are not many photos of this happening , but that does n't mean sharks can not be part of a seal 's normal diet			0
' @entity142 can weigh up to 700lbs ( 300 kilos )			0
it 's a question of size			0
if you are smaller than me , i will eat you			0
' the sharks are likely to have been males , which are smaller than the females at around 6ft long and just 60 to 120lbs			0
mr @entity21 added : ' if karma does indeed exist , the seal had better watch out if it returns during the great whites ’ winter hunting season			0

seals usually feed on fish , squid and crab , but will eat what they can find
the @entity8 fur seal can grow to 10ft long and can dive for up to 7.5 minutes
it is in competition for its preferred food - hake - with local fishermen
the male blue shark is usually *lightweight* and small
