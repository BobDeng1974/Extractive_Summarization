by @entity0 for @entity1 six years of construction of the @entity3 has been condensed into a fascinating two - minute timelapse video			1
@entity6 based photographer @entity5 took around 30,000 photographs of the 104 - storey building from the day construction began in 2006 to the day when the final beam was laid in 2012			1
he painstakingly compressed 1,100 photos to create the two - minute timelapse video which shows the 541 metre skyscraper emerging from the @entity14 as the years pass			2
the @entity16 building , which dominates the skyline and is the tallest building in the @entity19 , can be seen from miles around			1
one of the most visible , politicised and high profile buildings in the world , the @entity3 , which was built after the september 11 terrorist attack , lies on @entity24			0
for years the site lay abandoned as authorities and victims ' families argued over the design			0
eventually , a compromise was forged and the building was designed part memorial , part commercial centre and part transportation hub			2
the construction of the @entity3 in @entity16 was captured by photographer @entity5 who took 30,000 images and compressed 1,100 of them into a two - minute time lapse video @entity5 's camera clicked away both day and night as he collected images of the @entity3 to package into a tiny two - minute video showing its construction over six years once plans were agreed and politics put aside , the construction of the building , which is known colloquially as @entity47 , stepped up			1
in the final two years of construction , a new floor went up every week			0
and with it , came a robust security measures designed to withstand a terrorist attack on a building which has already been targeted twice in the past			2
the @entity3 can be seen mid way through construction			0
building took six years while the authorities and families of the victims decided what the purpose of the skyscraper should be the emerging @entity3 is mid construction and sits level with the @entity68 on the @entity14 skyline the first 20 storeys of the tower are a windowless concrete block strong enough to withstand the blast of a truck bomb , taking into account the 1993 bombing where @entity77 drove a truck filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the underground garage of the @entity81			1
the blast opened a 30 metre hole in the building and six people were killed , while 50,000 workers took hours to evacuate the building			2
meanwhile the glass which smashed and fell to the ground like knives during the september 11 attack is now shatter - proof			0
@entity92 and elevator shafts have their own ventilations systems and one staircase has been reserved for the emergency services only			0
all of this was captured in mr @entity99 's two minute video , highlighting the astonishing amount of time and energy that has gone into building one of the world 's most recognisable buildings			1
the @entity3 officially opened in 2014 and houses the likes of @entity107			0
