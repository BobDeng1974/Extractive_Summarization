landlady : @entity1 owns a house on @entity3 , it has emerged after @entity5 lifted the lid on the crime and grime of @entity3 , it might not come as a shock to hear that the area is of quite some interest to the police			1
but surprisingly , one high - ranking member of the force is not there to deal out justice – instead she saw the road as the perfect place to expand her property portfolio			1
@entity1 , deputy police and crime commissioner for the @entity22 , snapped up number 95 @entity3 in @entity24 back in 2002 , it emerged yesterday			1
mrs @entity1 , 49 , and her 57 - year - old husband @entity25 paid £ 30,000 for the property , which neighbours claim is now empty			1
the two - bedroom terraced house , which has increased in value to around £ 88,000 , sits just yards away from the petty criminals and recovering drug addicts who live in the crime - ridden area			0
it is located in the middle of the city ’s deprived @entity37 suburb , and the street is currently the subject of a controversial five - part observational documentary which set out to examine the everyday lives of its inhabitants			1
living only a few doors away are some of the ‘ stars ’ of the series – which has shown residents being threatened with eviction , drinking strong lager in the street and discussing breaking into a delivery driver ’s van in order to steal his sat nav			0
the property is close to the ramshackle address of self - confessed alcoholic and recovering drug addict @entity57 , 44 , who is referred to by his nickname , @entity59 , on the programme			0
some of the other neighbours living close by include @entity62 and @entity81 , both 23 , who openly joked about fiddling their benefits claims in the first episode of the show			0
all the more surprising then that mrs @entity1 , who earns £ 65,000 a year and is currently enjoying a holiday cruise in the @entity87 , would want to put down roots in such an insalubrious part of town			2
the house is by no means the only piece of the police chief ’s property empire			2
according to her register of interests she also owns land in @entity37 , another plot of land in the city ’s @entity101 area – and has bought a £ 450,000 , six - bedroom house on the outskirts of upmarket @entity105			0
mrs @entity1 , whose second role as the @entity108 councillor representing @entity111 ’s @entity110 ward comes with an annual salary of £ 16,267 , has also seen two of her children get on the property ladder at the tender age of just 19 and 22			1
last year they inherited a five - bedroom property in @entity118 where mrs @entity1 ’s parents were born			1
child ' bride ' : a 20 - year - old @entity123 , right , boasted to cameras that his 15 - year - old ' wife ' , left , was ' no problem ' unsightly : the programme shows that there are often large amounts of rubbish heaped up on the street it is unclear whether the @entity3 property was inhabited when @entity3 was being filmed between october 2012 and october last year			1
however records show that @entity135 , 31 , thought to be mr @entity135 ’s son from an earlier relationship , was formerly registered as living at the house – and the property has since been let out to other tenants			0
last night a woman who answered the door at her detached house in sought - after @entity141 in @entity105 said only : ‘ @entity1 is n’t here			2
‘ she ’s on holiday in the @entity87 on a cruise			0
’ the programme has attracted its fair share of controversy , with some of the people filmed for the show claiming they were ‘ duped ’ into taking part in what they were told would be about the street ’s ‘ close - knit community ’			0
@entity5 has strongly denied any suggestion of wrongdoing .			2
