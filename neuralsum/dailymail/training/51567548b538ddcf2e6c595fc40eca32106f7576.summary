mystery : @entity2 mp @entity1 handed over an explosive dossier about a paedophile ring working from @entity5 but the names remain a mystery the explosive dossier compiled by mp @entity1 is believed to be among 114 files ‘ potentially relevant ’ to child abuse now known to have been lost or destroyed by the @entity12			1
in 1983 the @entity2 mp for @entity14 said he had eight names of ' really important , public figures ' who unless they were arrested he would ‘ expose in @entity17 ’			1
based on his descriptions , these are thought to include mps , civil servants , a diplomat and even a @entity25 official			1
some had links to the @entity28 , who wanted sex with children legalised , he said			2
@entity1 handed his ' 40 - page dossier ' to the then home secretary @entity33 , which set out allegations of a paedophile circle ‘ operating and networking within and around ’ the @entity5 elite			1
another copy was kept by mr @entity1 ' wife and another was allegedly handed to the then @entity42 , sir @entity43 and then the police			2
all the copies vanished and nothing came of the investigations but now the @entity1 dossier is central to allegations that there was a high level cover - up to protect those in power			2
there has been speculation about who could have been named in it - @entity57 has considered who the mp could have implicated			1
politicians was @entity60 named ? @entity60 , a notorious paedophile mp , may have been in the dossier in august 1983 , @entity1 told the @entity62 that he had given the names of ‘ eight prominent figures ’ to the @entity42			1
he told the paper : ‘ i ’ve got eight names of big people , really important names , public figures			1
’ he said that , unless action was taken , he would ‘ expose them in @entity17 ’			2
he added : ‘ one of these people is a friend of mine , but you have to be merciless protecting the young			2
these people must not be allowed to get away with it just because they are important in public life			2
’ that ' friend ' may have been @entity79 , who was mrs @entity80 ’s private secretary despite being described by fellow conservative @entity81 as ‘ noted pederast with a liking for young boys ’			1
@entity79 was also caught cottaging in public toilets with underage boys but instead of being pursued through the courts was released with a caution			1
he also went around public gardens ' cruising ' for men to have sex with			0
he died after a heart attack in 1995 aged 51			0
in 2012 @entity94 , a former @entity2 mp and ex-leader of the @entity96 , said he had seen evidence linking sir @entity79 to @entity100 children ’s homes where up to 650 children were sexually , physically and emotionally abused over 20 years			1
another mp in the dossier was likely to be @entity60 , the @entity60 mp for @entity103 exposed as a paedophile after his death			1
@entity60 ’s depravity knew no bounds and was probably known about at the very highest levels of the establishment , including the security services			2
but the plight of his victims was ignored on the grounds of ‘ political expediency ’			0
police submitted files about @entity60 ’s abuse of boys in his hometown of @entity103 in 1970 , 1998 and 1999 , but each time prosecutors recommended that no action should be taken against him			1
a senior @entity2 politician was also said to be part of a @entity5 child sex ring , although he has not been named			1
the former mp was caught by customs with child porn videos after entering the @entity128 at @entity129 after an official saw him ' acting suspiciously '			2
the tapes showed children ' clearly under the age of 12 ' being forced into sex but when the materials were handed to his bossed the man was never arrested or charged			0
last night it emerged at least 12 men have come forward to accuse a @entity141 peer of abusing them when they were children			0
the historical allegations against the man span several decades and include accusations of rape and other serious sexual assaults			0
a source familiar with the police investigation said at least a dozen men had contacted officers to say they were abused by the peer , making a number of ‘ horrendous ’ allegations			0
the peer , who the @entity156 is not naming for legal reasons , has not been arrested or questioned in connection with the claims			0
it is not clear if he was known to @entity1			0
the @entity163 claims : @entity1 told the @entity165 in 1984 that a footman was abused by a royal official @entity1 ' dossier is said to have made links between the @entity28 , a group that campaigned to make sex between adults and children legal , and an official who may have been linked to @entity25 in some way			1
@entity1 told the @entity165 in 1984 that there was a cover - up at the @entity25 and a young footman was abused by a a royal official , which was covered up			1
the civil servant @entity1 said that a senior civil servant was helping to run a paedophile ring from @entity184			2
the mp claimed the man had at least 57 obscene slides of men having sex with children			0
he said : ' i 'm concerned about the cover - up of a senior civil servant who is a paedophile and wants sex with children legalised			1
he is a security risk '			0
secret life : sir @entity196 had a double identity he used to rent a flat to keep child pornography the diplomat in 1981 he used parliamentary privilege to name diplomat sir @entity196 , a decorated diplomat who lived a secret life as a paedophile			1
he was member ‘ 330 ’ of the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children			0
he rented a flat at 95 @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 under the name of @entity212 to store @entity28 literature and graphic correspondence with fellow paedophiles			0
but sir @entity79 made a mistake and left a packet of paedophile material in an envelope on a @entity210 bus			1
it was addressed to mr @entity212 at @entity223 in @entity224 afterwards , in november 1978 , police raided the @entity223 flat			0
what they found there was a huge trove of paedophilia and other extreme pornography			0
among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which sir @entity79 had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies , the latter including sex with minors			1
even the hardened cops of the @entity240 were ‘ revolted ’ by the @entity208 haul			0
he sobbed as he was interviewed and feared he would be exposed and his reputation ruined			0
and yet he was n't			0
much to the anger and disbelief of the @entity240 he was let off with a caution			0
he died in 1992 aged 77 .			0

@entity2 mp had 8 people he wanted to expose - but their names are a mystery
based on his descriptions they are believed to be politicians , civil servants , a diplomat and a royal official
@entity103 mp sir @entity60 , and former parliamentary private secretary sir @entity79 may have been on the list
in 1981 he named diplomat sir @entity196 as a paedophile
