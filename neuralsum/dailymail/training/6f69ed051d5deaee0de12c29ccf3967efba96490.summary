an @entity1 pound dog is now on the road to recovery after his baffled caregivers finally discovered what was making his hair fall out and skin pitifully inflamed : he 's allergic to humans			1
@entity11 , a black lab , showed up to @entity13 in @entity14 back in june			2
caregivers there hoped a healthy diet , baths and some much - needed love would allow his hair to grow back and cracked skin to heal			0
when none of it worked , a blood test revealed @entity11 's surprising diagnosis			1
poor pooch : @entity11 , a rescued black lab in @entity14 , was found blistered and balding with wounds where he 'd bitten and scratched at his body because of unbearable itching nothing worked : @entity11 was given baths , fed the best food and given extra love and attention but the terribly inflamed skin just was n't improving the way his caregivers had hoped ' humans			1
i did n't believe her at first , ' @entity37 , who rescued @entity11 , said of the veterinarian 's verdict			0
' i thought she was kidding			0
' just as humans can be allergic to dogs , they can apparently be allergic to us , @entity41 learned			0
more specifically , @entity11 is allergic to human dander -- the minute particles we constantly shed from our skin and scalp			0
the intolerance was inflaming @entity11 's skin and driving him to scratch and bite at his rapidly balding body constantly			2
shocking diagnosis : a blood test eventually revealed the problem -- @entity11 is allergic to humans just like us : specifically , @entity11 is allergic to human dander -- the minute particles we constantly shed from our skin and scalp when the itching was at its worst , the folks at @entity13 were forced to keep his head in a cone at all times			1
to combat the problem , @entity41 found a vet who could whip up a serum for @entity11 just like the allergy shots so often given to humans			1
and just as in people , the immunotherapy uses proteins of the allergen itself to slowly teach @entity11 's immune system to tolerate people			2
' they just put a serum together , just like with kids ' allergies and other dogs ' allergies , and he starts on allergy shots this week , ' @entity41 told @entity86			0
improving : being in the hands of kind animal lovers dedicated to making him better has already helped @entity11 improve allergy shots : a veterinarian has created a special serum that will hopefully encourage @entity11 's immune system to better tolerate human dander -- then his rescuers intend to find him a good home			1

@entity14 pound dog @entity11 lost much of his hair and was forced to wear a cone at all times because he was biting himself bloody
baffled caregivers tried baths , the best food and *steroids* but @entity11 's recovery was not going well
a blood test eventually revealed his rare allergy -- now he *'ll* receive allergy shots just like humans
