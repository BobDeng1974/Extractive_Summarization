and are you bored of never knowing whether to plump for a small , medium or large in @entity7 ? a revolutionary ' virtual tape measure ' - known as @entity10 fashion - promises to make badly fitting clothes ( and even badly lit fitting rooms ) a thing of the past , advising the user on which size dress , trouser or top they should buy in every retailer			0
currently , between 30 and 60 per cent of all clothes bought online are returned to the shop , and the new virtual tape measure aims to reduce the amount the web - based body - scanner would take detailed measurements of the body via webcam or smartphone , create a 3d image of the user , then advise on which size garment to buy whenever they visit the website of a participating retailer			1
taking multiple measurements of the body , the system aims to ensure the best possible fit , saving shoppers and retailers millions of pounds a year in return postage costs , as well as eliminating the need to send back clothes that are the wrong size or fit			1
currently , between 30 and 60 per cent of all clothes bought online are returned to the shop			1
the new process could revolutionise online clothes - shopping for both the retailer and the consumer body scanning is already starting to make a mark in the clothing retail sector , but these often involve the user stepping into a machine that ' photocopies ' the body			2
the new software - being developed by @entity60 and computer vision experts at the @entity62 - requires only a photo of the user in their underwear , their height , and an internet connection			0
@entity70 from @entity60 said : ' the potential benefits for the fashion industry and for shoppers are huge			0
' currently , it 's common for online shoppers to order two or three different sizes of the same item of clothing at the same time , as they ’re unsure which one will fit best			1
' professor @entity80 from the @entity62 says : ' it 's unrealistic to expect online clothes shoppers to have the time or inclination to take a series of highly accurate body measurements of themselves			2
the new system makes it all very easy			0
' the 18 - month project @entity89 is being developed in collaboration with body - mapping specialists @entity91 and digital creative agency guided			1
some £ 18,000 of funding is being provided by the @entity95 ( @entity95 )			0
the research builds on previous work by the @entity62 in developing @entity99 body - shape templates from single - view images , which has been used commercially in creating animated representations of people for games such as @entity104			1
plans to launch the new system are anticipated within two years the new system builds up a detailed image of body measurements , making it much easier for the shopper to order the correct size for their body dimensions			2

@entity89 builds on *technology* used in the @entity104 computer game
web - based body - scanner would operate via webcam or smartphone

currently , 30 - 60 *%* garments bought online are returned to shop
