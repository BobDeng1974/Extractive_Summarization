by @entity0 former commons speaker @entity1 last night mounted a ferocious attack on @entity3 for breaking ‘ the mould of @entity8 history ’ by downgrading the status of the new @entity5			0
@entity1 , a respected and much - loved figure on all sides at @entity11 , accused the prime minister of a ‘ careless disregard for the way our constitution works ’			0
she even suggested that the position of international development secretary @entity18 should be downgraded to allow the new @entity20 leader @entity19 to enjoy the same rank as all of her predecessors			1
furious : the much - loved @entity1 accused the prime minister of a ‘ careless disregard for the way our constitution works ’ the row has been caused by the prime minister ’s decision not to grant @entity32 full @entity34 status after his reshuffle earlier this month			1
he decided to downgrade @entity32 because of a legal limit on the number of full @entity34 posts and salaries			1
awkward : @entity41 ( left ) has kept his place in the @entity34 despite being demoted by @entity3 ( right ) and he has also kept his salary the problem with numbers arose because @entity41 , in being demoted to @entity46 , has been given @entity34 status – despite the fact that the post did not attract the full @entity34 rank or salary when held by @entity52			1
as a consequence , @entity32 can attend @entity34 but is not allowed to vote , and is being paid the @entity20 ’ minister of state salary of £ 78,891 a year , compared with the £ 101,038 that her predecessor , lord hill , received			1
the unprecedented move has prompted angry protests from senior figures from all three main parties in the @entity20			0
@entity1 has suggested that the position of international development secretary @entity18 ( left ) be downgraded to allow the new @entity20 leader @entity19 ( right ( to enjoy the same rank and priviieges as all of her predecessors @entity1 , speaking in an emergency debate in the upper house last night , warned peers they lived in ‘ dangerous times ’ thanks to mr @entity3 ’s decision			1
‘ the prime minister ’s demotion of this @entity20 in his @entity34 reshuffle challenges its rights , its authority and its long - established role and status in the constitution , ’ she said			2
‘ it breaks the mould of @entity8 history			0
it strikes at the very roots of our bicameral parliament			0
the place of this @entity20 in the @entity34 of every prime minister has never been challenged – until now			2
‘ i never thought i would witness such careless disregard for the way our constitution works			0
’ @entity1 said it was a ‘ dead certainty ’ that @entity32 ’s downgraded status would be used as an excuse to ignore the views of the @entity20			2
and , although international development secretaries have been cabinet ministers since @entity100 ’s @entity99 in 1997 , @entity1 challenged mr @entity3 over the post ’s elevated status			2
she said mr @entity3 ’s claim that his hands were tied by the restrictions on the numbers of full cabinet ministers in the @entity108 was ‘ a pretence ’			0
‘ which section of that act dictated that he promoted the @entity112 [ @entity113 ] to the @entity34 and demoted the @entity5 ? ’ she demanded			0
‘ why is the minister for overseas aid made a secretary of state , with full @entity34 rank and pay , while the salary of the leader of this @entity20 and her status is downgraded ? ’ in an attempt to contain the row , @entity120 said mr @entity3 regarded @entity32 ’s position as ‘ a purely temporary one ’ which he aimed to rectify ‘ at the earliest opportunity ’			1
the prime minister has said he will restore the full @entity34 status of the @entity5 ‘ immediately after the election ’ if he remains in power .			1
