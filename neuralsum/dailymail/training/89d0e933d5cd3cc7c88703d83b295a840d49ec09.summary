@entity9 , 33 , suffocated her daughter @entity10 with a pillow after suffering from ' delusions and hallucinations ' - despite the mother and child being seen by authorities at least 55 times in the space of three years			1
a @entity19 published today revealed that just two months before @entity10 was killed her mother was assessed by an experienced psychiatrist as having no symptoms indicative of a serious mental illness			1
tragedy : a @entity19 has cited a catalogue of failings by authorities after paranoid schizophrenic @entity9 suffocated her four - year - old daughter @entity10 with a pillow after suffering from ' delusions and hallucinations ' each time medical opinion was sought @entity33 was considered not to have any enduring mental health problems , the report said			1
but her own family said @entity33 had been mentally unwell for more than a decade @entity33 , who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2005 , had been smoking cannabis since the age of 12			0
the report said the use of the drug often coincides with an exacerbation of psychosis			0
she was made the subject of a hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at @entity50 last november			1
during the hearing , the court heard the woman feared she was being persecuted by her neighbours , and she suffocated her four - year - old daughter ' out of love ' to protect her			2
there is no evidence to suggest the neighbour did anything wrong			0
when sentencing her , mr @entity61 said : ‘ the day you ended your daughter 's life will , i am sure , be with you forever			2
’ criticisms : a 65 - page @entity19 report on behalf of @entity68 criticised ' poor judgment and a lack of robustness in managerial oversight ' among some of the seven state agencies who had contact with the family the judge said it was not the purpose of the court to punish @entity33 , as doctors on both sides agreed she was and is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia			1
he said : ‘ i fully accept that you did what you did out of your love for and concern for @entity10			2
’ he added : ‘ you were thinking in a distorted and deluded way , but you genuinely believed that you were acting to protect your daughter from harm by persons who wished her ill. you thought that because you were mentally ill at the time			0
’ social services were first made aware of concerns for the child in july 2008 more than three years before her death when @entity33 said her daughter , then 18 months old , wanted to have a sexual relationship with her and that she was hearing voices			1
scene : the police investigation is underway as flowers are left outside the house of @entity9 after she killed her young daughter @entity10 twice police used emergency powers , in july 2009 and october 2010 , taking the child from her mother , but @entity10 was returned with ' undue haste ' , the report said			1
on both occasions @entity33 stripped her daughter naked because she said she wanted to check for signs of sexual abuse			0
parents , nursery staff and even housing association workmen at her flat repeatedly reported concerns but despite a ' @entity126 ' , conferences and strategy meetings there was a ' fairly chaotic ' approach to case planning , the report said			0
damning : the report states parents , nursery staff and even housing association workmen at her flat repeatedly reported concerns just two months before @entity10 was killed her mother was assessed by an experienced psychiatrist as having no symptoms indicative of a serious mental illness			1
on one occasion she hit @entity139 so hard at local shops , three members of the public called police			0
and she told the child on another occasion at a police station : ' it 's just me and you now ; we will have to take each day as it comes and see how long we last			0
at least we know there is a place for us up there			0
' the report says @entity156 received a total of 10 referrals , the first being made in july 2008			2
the common thread in the referrals related to concerns about @entity33 's mental health and her management of her daughter			1
but on one occasion , after @entity10 was placed in emergency foster care in july 2009 , police and a social worker visited her home , where they concluded there was no immediate concerns for the four - year - old 's safety and that she should return home			2
the report concluded @entity10 's death ' could not have been predicted '			1
@entity177 , chairman of @entity68 , said : ' whilst the report finds that the tragic death of this little girl could not have been predicted by any of the agencies working with the family , the recommendations make it clear that agencies could and should have done some things differently			1
' this was a complex case , made all the more so by the mother 's mental health needs , and presenting behaviour			2
' this led to an over-emphasis by agencies on dealing with the mother and her needs , rather than focusing on the child and ensuring her needs were met			0
' @entity10 's father , @entity198 , was living mostly in @entity199 before his daughter 's @entity200 believed she was being persecuted and killed @entity10 ' out of love ' so no one could harm her daughter			1
@entity10 was found by police at their home in @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , on september 22 , 2011 after the defendant turned up at @entity210 with a child 's suitcase			1
she had slashed her arms with a knife and told a nurse she had suffocated her @entity216 will only be released from hospital when cleared by doctors and by a @entity220 independent review panel			2
in the three years leading up to @entity10 's death , the seven agencies had numerous meetings with the mother , often with the daughter present , the report states			1
the agencies saw the mother , either through home visits or through her attending services , at least 55 times			1
this figure includes face - to - face interactions only			0
there was further contact between @entity33 and the services through phone calls and letters			0
@entity156 : @entity33 had at least 17 face - to - face interactions with social workers between 2008 and 2011			0
@entity241 : officers met with @entity33 at least five times , initially in july 2008 when a visit was made to her home with social workers			2
the report says home conditions were seen to be of a ' high standard ' and there was nothing to indicate @entity33 suffered from a mental health condition			0
@entity254 and @entity255 ( children 's centre ) : the report cites several occasions when concerns were raised at the centre where @entity33 attended with her daughter from february 2009			2
