it seems that almost everyday there 's a new advertisement for the last must - have piece of technology			1
but @entity6 just one - upped the competition with the announcement of their 2015 catalogue aka ' bookbook ' - a play on @entity13 's @entity12			1
this parody video is particularly timely as @entity13 gears up to launch the new @entity15 with what will surely be a hyperbolic and exquisitely designed ad campaign			1
but can expand to 15 x 8 inches , ' the narrator explains ' once in awhile , something comes along that changes the way we live , ' the advertisement begins			0
' a device so simple and intuitive , using it feels almost familiar			0
' ' introducing the 2015 @entity6 catalogue			1
' ' the first thing to note is no cables - not even a power cable , ' @entity39 continues			2
' not even a power cable			0
the 2015 @entity6 catalogue comes fully charged and the battery life is eternal			1
' the entire advert is narrated by @entity43 , dubbed the chief design guru the advert demonstrates the ' bookbook 's ' unique ability to expand its interface - simply by opening it ' navigation is based on tactile touch technology			1
to start browsing , scroll right to left to move forward and left to right to move backward			0
' ' notice something else ? that ’s right – no lag			0
each crystal clear page loads instantaneously , no matter how fast you scroll			0
' and when it comes to bookmarking , the ' bookbook ' has that covered , too			2
' if you find something you want to save for later , simply bookmark it , ' the model demonstrates by turning down the top corner of the page			0
' content comes pre-installed via 328 high definition pages , ' @entity39 teases in the video ' even if you close the application , you can easily find the bookmark again			0
' for multiple users , the 2015 @entity6 catalogue offers a colour - coded tab system to avoid confusion			1
' if you want to share a particularly inspiring item , you literally share it			0
' ' another special feature is password protection , which is voice - activated			0
' all you need to say is : ‘ excuse me , that ’s mine ! ’ ' at @entity6 , we feel that technology is life - enhancing and should be at the hands of everyone , ' the advert concludes			1
' so , the 2015 @entity6 catalogue is free			1
' the advert also joking offers voice - activated security protection			2
simply say , ' excuse me ! that 's mine ! ' behold @entity6 's colour - coded system software - if you 'd like to share a page with a friend , simply place a tab on it			2

@entity6 2015 catalogue ad campaign is parody of @entity13 's *macbook* ads
*hilarious* advert *describes* catalogue as latest must - have technology
*adopts* the phrase ' bookbook ' in attempt to make light of hyperbolic ads
