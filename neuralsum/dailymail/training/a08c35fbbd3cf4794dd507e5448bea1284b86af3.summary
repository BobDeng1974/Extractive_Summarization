by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 20:19 est , 1 march 2013 it 's not the sort of fuss you would expect from the well - heeled residents of a sleepy market town – or a former @entity8 presenter for that matter			0
but when it comes to the might of @entity15 , the people of @entity11 in @entity12 are n’t taking any chances			1
out of a population of 9,350 , some 8,500 people – including former @entity8 presenter @entity18 – have joined a campaign to stop the supermarket giant building a superstore near the town			0
one of those backing the campaign is former @entity8 presenter @entity18			0
she is pictured with @entity38 @entity37 and even though @entity15 is yet to submit a planning application to the council , the politely named no thanks @entity15 group , backed by retail guru @entity40 , has already held a protest march			1
hundreds took part , including @entity46 who carried a placard			0
she said : ‘ it ’s incredible how many people have come along			0
i looked over my shoulder and i could n’t believe how many people were there			0
’ @entity15 plans to buy a large hotel to the north of @entity11 and turn it into a 28,000sq ft store , employing 200 people , with more than 200 parking spaces			1
currently the nearest @entity15 outlets are six miles away in @entity59 which has a @entity15 and @entity60			2
local people argue they do not need another supermarket because there is a small @entity64 ’s and co-op near the town centre , while shopkeepers fear they will be forced out of business if locals are tempted to bypass the high street in favour of driving to a big supermarket			1
campaign : unlike most other @entity75 towns , historic @entity11 does not currently have a @entity15			1
@entity76 , head verger of @entity78 , is pictured at a protest as part of the protest , several businesses shut on tuesday afternoon and boarded up their windows to illustrate the impact a @entity15 will have on trade			1
local businessman @entity86 , 53 , who owns a stationers , said : ‘ if people go to @entity15 for all of their shopping they wo n’t be coming to the high street			1
‘ it ’s the same as what is happening all across the country , where @entity15 opens a huge store on the edge of a town and takes away the footfall from independent butchers , bakers and candlestick makers			1
’ he added : ‘ it feels like a @entity27 situation , but we have to make a stand			0
‘ i do n’t think @entity15 has come up against this amount of opposition before they have even submitted a planning application			2
’ @entity109 , co-owner of @entity111 ’s butchers in @entity112 , said : ‘ we have been here since 1840 when my great - great grandfather opened the shop			0
‘ there were four butcher shops here 30 years ago but now we are the only one left			0
‘ the problem is that because @entity15 will be about half - a - mile away , people will go there , and think “ i ca n’t be bothered to drive to @entity111 ’s , let ’s get the meat from here today ”			2
‘ there will be fewer people on the high street so there will be fewer customers coming in and we will end up losing business			1
‘ @entity11 is a very quirky and unique town and a @entity15 will make it just like any other			1
’ @entity129 , 32 , of @entity130 , said : ‘ a @entity15 store will pinch the high street and reduce footfall			1
it would be absolute suicide for the council to accept this			0
‘ @entity15 are n’t really in direct competition with us but if people stop coming into town it will affect us			2
’ @entity11 resident @entity142 , 48 , a married mother of four , said : ‘ anything that changes the fabric of the town and makes it less attractive to live or do business in will affect the quality of life here			2
‘ historically , towns have n’t won in these battles against @entity15 but i think we should remain positive and keep on working together			2
everyone involved thinks we will win			0
' @entity152 : virtually every resident of the ancient capital of @entity155 is fighting to ' hold back the tide ' and prevent @entity11 from turning into a ' @entity157 '			1
local business owners are pictured fears for independent stores : shopkeepers boarded up their windows in protest at the plans @entity165 , 74 , chairman of the @entity11 branch for the @entity167 , fears the @entity15 store would jeopardise @entity11 achieving heritage town status , which is vital for future tourism			1
he said : ‘ the gateway into the town would be a mighty @entity15 store			2
we have 350 listed buildings , @entity11 is an incredibly historic town and that ’s what people come to see			2
but the problem is the mighty @entity15 tends to trample over small towns like ours			0
’ on the no thanks @entity15 website and under the sub-heading ‘ a @entity12 town v. @entity15 ’ it is claimed a recent poll showed 663 people were against the store while 43 were in favour			1
a statement adds : ‘ we can not underestimate the impact @entity15 would have on the very fabric of the town centre and our way of life			0
’ yesterday a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ we are consulting with local people on our proposals and have not submitted an application			0
we know many residents shop in @entity59 and would like to offer them greater choice in @entity11			0

virtually every resident of @entity11 in @entity12 is against plans for a @entity15
they fear for independent shops on quaint high street
politely titled protest group called ' no thanks @entity15 ' has now been launched
