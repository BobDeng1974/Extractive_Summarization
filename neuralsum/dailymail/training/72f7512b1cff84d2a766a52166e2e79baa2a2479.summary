pupils who are led to believe that taking more subjects is a ‘ good thing to do ’ are being misled , said @entity1 , chief executive of the @entity2 board			1
instead of having more subjects on offer for testing , schools should provide more time for extra-curricular activities , community volunteering and work experience , said mr @entity1			1
and pupils should sit a maximum of eight gcses , suggested mr @entity1 , so that a greater focus can be given to developing life skills and preparing teenagers for work			1
his comments were made as @entity2 launched a project predicting how the country ’s education system will evolve over the next 12 years			2
mr @entity1 said that if the number of subjects students are examined in is reduced , education standards will improve			1
he said there is ‘ nothing wrong with a rigorous , solid education system , but not exams for exams sake			0
‘ some students without doubt think – or are encouraged to think – that 14 or 15 gcses is a good thing to do			0
‘ my personal opinion is that it ’s not			0
look at the current @entity53 ’s accountability measure – the best eight , with double weighting for maths and @entity56			0
‘ to me , that does n’t sound like a bad volume			0
what the eight is i do n’t want to get into , but that leaves space in the curriculum for the other things			0

mr @entity1 said that if the number of subjects students are examined in is reduced , education standards will improve mr @entity1 criticised the obsession with achieving high results , and said that little time is given to developing other important skills at school			1
‘ what ’s missed when you are doing these extra gcses ? i think working in the community is an important part of developing social life			2
’ ‘ it ’s a middle - class way of describing it , but i think things like leading a @entity84 pack is an important life skill for young people			0
’ a spokesperson for @entity89 's @entity88 said it should be left to individual schools to decide how many exams their students will take his speech somes as the @entity95 is redesigning league table to track pupil ’s progress in their best eight subjects rather than the number of students getting c grades in five gcses			1
mr @entity1 said the average pupil currently sat around 10 exams but some took up to 15			2
he said a more innovative approach to teaching using digital technology will stop schools from becoming ‘ exam factories ’			2

’ a @entity88 spokesman said : ‘ it is down to schools to decide how many gcse subjects their pupils should study – but it is vital that however many pupils take , it is in their best interests			1
’ ‘ our new ' best eight ' accountability measure will ensure that secondary schools will focus on the progress and performance of pupils in a broad range of eight key gcse subjects , including core academic subjects			2
