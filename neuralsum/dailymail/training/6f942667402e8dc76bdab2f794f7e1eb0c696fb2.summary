by @entity0 thieves , burglars and violent thugs will be free to work in schools , hospitals and care homes after a ruling by judges			2
the @entity9 said thousands of criminals should be allowed to wipe their record clean so they are not haunted forever by past offences			1
the change means people will not be forced to disclose some convictions to prospective employers – because this breaches their human rights			1
those affected by the ruling include people applying for certain kinds of jobs involving work with children or vulnerable adults			2
a man who was forced to reveal two cautions for bike theft aged 11 to his new employers has won his case the the @entity9 ( pictured ) after arguing it breached his human rights up to now , anyone wanting to work in these areas has had to disclose any previous convictions or cautions , which stayed on their records indefinitely			1
but a panel of five @entity9 judges yesterday upheld a @entity40 judgment that blanket checks could breach a person ’s right to a private or family life			2
the @entity45 challenged that judgment , saying it compromised the protection of children and vulnerable groups , but in the meantime introduced a system to filter out single minor convictions or cautions during an enhanced criminal records check			1
this meant that offences including burglary , common assault , shoplifting and trespassing would eventually be expunged from a person ’s record as long as they were not jailed or committed any further crimes			0
under new guidelines from the government 's @entity65 employers will not be able to see or ask about certain old or minor cautions and convictions			1
they will still be able to see convictions relating to violent or sexual offences , or certain offences relation to children or vulnerable people			0
they will also be able to see offences that resulted in a conviction , whether or not the sentence was suspended			0
@entity79 , of the @entity81 think - tank , said the @entity9 ruling was ‘ dangerous ’			1
he added : ‘ with huge numbers of serious , repeat offenders avoiding prison it is time for courts to be tougher on criminals , not recommending that criminal records can be wiped clean			0
’ certain offences for which people are convicted or cautioned will still stay on the record indefinitely , including all serious sexual and violent crimes and all terrorism offences			0
however , under the new rules , adult offenders will see convictions for burglary , shoplifting or common assault , for instance , cleared from their record after 11 years , and cautions after six years , as long as they were not jailed and have not reoffended			2
young offenders will have no visible conviction record after five - and - a - half years , and no caution record after two years			0
this will mean employers will not be able to learn about these offences unless the applicant tells them			0
the case before the @entity9 involved two people who had jobs jeopardised because they had been reprimanded for minor crimes			1
lawyers for @entity117 and @entity118 warned that the ruling could affect hundreds of thousands of job applications where convictions were ' plainly relevant ' one man , known only as @entity123 , had been forced to disclose police warnings he received aged 11 in 2002 in connection with the alleged theft of two bicycles when he applied for a job aged 17 which could have involved working with children			1
a woman , identified as @entity131 , was refused a job in a care home eight years after receiving a caution for stealing a packet of false fingernails from a shop			0
the @entity9 said the disclosures the pair had been forced to make were not based on any rational assessment of risk			1
@entity142 , of the @entity143 , said : ‘ this judgment sensibly recognises that people should not be haunted forever by minor childhood offences			0
’ meanwhile , a parliamentary inquiry led by @entity149 peer @entity148 has said children who commit minor offences should have their record wiped clean when they turn 18 .			0

man complained after being forced to reveal cautions to new employers
identified only as ' t ' , he said forced disclosure breached his human rights
@entity9 ruled in his *favour* , *backing* previous @entity165 ruling
employers now can not ask about certain minor or old convictions
