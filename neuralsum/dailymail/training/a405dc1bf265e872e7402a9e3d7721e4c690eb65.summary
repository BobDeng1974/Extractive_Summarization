by @entity0 published : 12:50 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 13:43 est , 4 july 2013 the origin of our moon has long been debated			0
now , a scientist has claimed that @entity5 effectively ' gave birth ' to the moon four - and - a - half billion years ago			1
a controversial new theory has been proposed that a giant explosion equivalent to 40 billion atomic bombs originating from the @entity5 's core somehow led to the formation of the moon			1
planetary scientist @entity13 believes this violent event took place approximately four - and - a - half billion years ago and could answer the hotly contested question of where our moon comes from			1
a @entity19 scientist has claimed that the moon was created by massive nuclear blast which tore apart our planet four billion years ago the scientist , from @entity24 in @entity25 , told @entity27 magazine that previous explanations about how the moon came to be simply do not add up			1
@entity30 's son , astronomer @entity29 , proposed that the early @entity5 spun so fast that it fell apart , hurling a part of itself into space that became the moon			0
his theory was popular but was then eclipsed by the giant impact hypothesis , or ' big splat ' , which said that a @entity37 - sized object crashed into an infant @entity5 and shattered on impact , the magazine reported			1
in this theory , the debris formed the moon			0
however , it was largely thrown - out when astronauts brought back rocks from the @entity44 moon landings			0
@entity29 , astronomer son of famous scientist @entity30 ( pictured ) proposed that the early @entity5 spun so fast that it fell apart , hurling a part of itself into space that became the moon chemical analysis of the rocks last year by the @entity48 found that they shared identical oxygen , silicon and potassium isotopes with @entity5 , hinting that the @entity53 shares its origin with the @entity5			2
@entity55 said that taken at face value , the findings suggest that the moon was once part of the @entity5 that was blasted into space by an enormous explosion from the @entity5 's fiery core			2
to do this , he believes that there must have been a ' massive energy kick ' delivered quickly and he calculates that the explosion was the strength of 40 billion atomic bombs the size of those dropped on @entity69			0
the idea that the @entity5 's core harbours a huge nuclear reactor has been around for over 60 years			1
there is also evidence of much smaller natural fossil reactors up to 10 metres across in @entity76 that were active around 10 billion years ago			2
@entity55 said that : ' a nuclear blast is the only thing we could come up with that could produce the necessary energy quickly enough ' to blast the moon into space			1
scientists have reasoned that heavy elements like uranium and plutonium in heavy rocks sank deep into the @entity5 after it was formed and collected on its outer core where they formed large liquid reservoirs			0
the radioactive material in the rocks set off mini reactions , which when combined with enough fuel , produced an enormous explosion			0
view of the @entity5 from the moon			0
there have been numerous theories about how the moon was formed including the ' big splat ' theory that a @entity37 - sized piece of rock collided with the @entity5 and the moon was formed from its debris this theory of an internal nuclear reactor could explain why @entity5 gives out more energy than it receives from the sun. however , experts have said that even if evidence of ' global georeactors ' was found , many scientists would need convincing that they were capable of creating the moon			1
there are many conflicting ideas of exactly how the moon came to be and scientists are starting to re-question older theories			0
@entity115 , a planetary scientist at @entity116 said : ' i do n't think you can separate the moon 's formation from a giant impact			2
' but he draws upon @entity30 's idea and the big splat and believes that a peculiar alignment of the sun , earth and moon is the reason why the moon orbits the @entity5 .			2

controversial new theory suggests that a giant explosion originating from the @entity5 's core somehow led to the formation of the moon
planetary scientist @entity13 believes that this violent event took place approximately four - and - a - half billion years ago
some scientists agree that a nuclear blast is the only thing that could produce the necessary energy quickly enough to blast the moon into space
there are many theories about the origin of the moon , including the ' big splat ' theory
