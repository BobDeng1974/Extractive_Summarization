by @entity0 published : 17:20 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 17:30 est , 6 may 2013 a former @entity2 dressmaker has told how her husband died after @entity5 call centre workers failed to recognise the urgency of his condition			1
@entity8 called the controversial helpline last wednesday evening after @entity10 , her husband of 33 years , developed severe abdominal pains			1
but staff who took the call wrongly categorised his case as ' not life - threatening ' and the ambulance took more than three hours to arrive			1
@entity8 and @entity17 , pictured on holiday in @entity19 last year			1
@entity10 , 64 , died of an aortic aneurysm after having to wait an hour for an ambulance after they used the @entity5 phone line mr @entity17 , 64 , was eventually taken to the @entity24 where he later died from a cardiac arrest			1
he had been suffering from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm , a tear to one of the major blood vessels which causes internal bleeding			2
although the condition has a high mortality rate , survival chances are far better the sooner a patient is given surgery to repair the tear			0
if mrs @entity8 , 73 , had spoken to a doctor or nurse rather than a call centre worker , they may have realised the urgency of his illness , especially given his medical history			1
he suffered from high blood pressure – which would have put him at higher risk from an aneurism – and had undergone bypass surgery following a major heart attack in 2002			0
with hindsight , mrs @entity8 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , regrets not calling 999 straight away			1
she says she called 111 shortly before 8pm but an ambulance did not arrive until after 11pm			2
( file picture ) the ambulance took more than three hours to arrive after staff who took the call wrongly categorised mr @entity17 's case as ' not life - threatening ' she said : ' i kept walking down the drive to see if anything was coming			1
@entity10 said , “ do n't bother them @entity64 , there 's probably people more urgent than me ”			1
' after waiting almost an hour she dialled 999			0
' they said , “ you 're on the list and an ambulance will get to you as soon as we 've got one free ” , ' mrs @entity8 said			2
this is because the case had been classed as ' non-life - threatening ' by 111 staff			1
' they told me they had got a lot of urgent cases			0
that 's when i said i said i think he is an emergency			0
he was rolling backwards and forwards in severe pain			2
' i just knew he was going to die			0
' mrs @entity8 's ordeal will prompt concerns that members of the public have been left confused as to whether to dial 999 or @entity5 111			2
at one point , mrs @entity8 , a grandmother of two , said she was told off by the woman @entity5 call centre worker for ' not listening '			1
she said : ' i needed her to speak up a bit as she was so quiet			0
she said , “ you 're not listening to me			0
” i thought she was quite rude			0
' neither the area 's @entity5 organisation @entity95 , nor the firm running 111 there were available for comment			0
there are concerns 111 , which has replaced @entity102 and local out - of - hours gp numbers , is putting lives at risk			2
a survey of 748 gps and hospital doctors by @entity109 found 70 per cent want it scrapped completely , while another 16 per cent say it should be withdrawn until problems are fixed			0
@entity111 , chief nursing officer from @entity112 , said : ' the vast majority of patients who use @entity5 111 are getting a good service , although it is clear that some are not and this is unacceptable			0
