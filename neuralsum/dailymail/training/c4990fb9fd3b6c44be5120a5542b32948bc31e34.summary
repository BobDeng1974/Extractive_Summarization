@entity0 brings you the second column from @entity4 star @entity3			2
the @entity6 driver looks back at his victory in @entity8 and ahead to this weekend 's @entity9			1
my victory at the @entity8 @entity9 was a special moment for the team			1
for us all to be together – and i was with my fiancée @entity16 , too – it was great			2
but we did n't really celebrate too much because it should only be the beginning			2
we swiftly turned our attention and focus to the next race here in @entity22 , which shows that maturity is a huge strength within the team			1
in fact ' mature ' is probably the best word to describe us at the moment			2
we have grown as a team and our time will come very , very soon where we will be winning more races – already to have success is a huge thing for us			1
cheer we go : @entity3 celebrates his victory at the @entity8 @entity9 , and right , with fiancée @entity16 all smiles : @entity3 and his @entity6 team pose for a celebratory picture following the @entity8 @entity9 after the race , i went to @entity40 on holiday with my fiancée and some friends , which was very nice , but throughout the trip , i remained in close contact with the team because there was so much that we learned from @entity50 , and subsequently there was so much information to go through – even while i was on holiday ! despite winning by almost 25 seconds , my victory in @entity8 was not as straightforward as it appeared			1
there were various issues that we had to deal with			0
the tyres , for example , were right on the edge of being too cold , so i had to keep the pace up all the time to ensure they stayed at the right temperature			0
of course , pre-season testing had gone well so we expected to look good in @entity8 , but to have such an advantage was still a surprise			1
understandably , i was very happy with that			0
getting the job done : @entity3 leads the drivers ' standings after romping to victory at the @entity8 @entity9 i 'll drink to that : @entity3 toasts with @entity77 - the @entity75 man was later disqualified from the race in @entity50 , we had the fastest car , but we must be careful because @entity22 is a totally different story , so we must keep an open mind			1
however , it is possible that we can do really well here , too			0
@entity77 was disqualified from the @entity8 @entity9			1
i do n't wish to comment on the details because i do n't have all the information , but it was definitely a big pity because he is @entity8 and to have an @entity8 on the podium was a great thing for the home crowd			1
there have been lots of comments about the new sound of @entity4			0
the thing with this sport is that we always tend to focus on the negatives , but there are so many more positives this year			0
the power units are much more contemporary and fuel efficient			0
the pack has also been shuffled around so there is n't always the same winner and that is very good for @entity4			0
i can understand people 's views about the noise			0
it is n't the same as with the @entity113 engines , but let 's focus on the positives			0
we are going to have some good racing for sure , and the cars are really exciting to drive and watch , from what i saw after the race			2
we should n’t rush into anything but take our time and see how things unfold over the next races			2
i have been in @entity125 since sunday			0
@entity126 are the team 's biggest partner , so i have been representing them and doing a lot of @entity130 we have done a lot of interesting things , like diving with sharks for instance , and it is great to do different activities , but the main thing is the @entity22 people are backing us and they are really enthusiastic about our team which is excellent to see			1
before and after : the @entity6 driver spent time at an aquarium in @entity22 where he dived with sharks it has obviously been a very difficult week for @entity22 with the focus on the tragic events of flight mh370 , and my thoughts and sympathies go to all the families and friends who have been affected			1
i only hope that , with the race this weekend , we can help to focus a more positive light on @entity22 and its wonderful people			1
the @entity22 @entity9 is one of the toughest on the calendar because of the intense heat and humidity , so you have to be very fit			1
i try and acclimatise to the conditions by staying outside as much as possible and doing sport outdoors			0
it is vital to stay hydrated , too			0
in fact , i am drinking right now because during the race i can sweat up to four litres which is massive and probably double the amount of a regular race			1
the race will be very demanding			2
by the end of the grand prix , your concentration levels will not be as high as they were at the beginning nor my fitness which will have reduced , too			0
no hard feelings : @entity175 ( left ) and @entity3 shake hands after last year 's @entity22 @entity9 at last year 's @entity9 , i was asked to ' hold station ' behind my team - mate @entity175 , but i do n't want to go into that because it is history			1
what i can say is that this year we will give you some exciting racing because that is what @entity6 is here to do			2
we want to entertain and put on a good show			0
at the same time there will be circumstances where we as drivers have to put the team first , and they have already been discussed so everything is clear			2
closed chapter : @entity3 says his incident with @entity175 at last year 's race has been consigned to history @entity196 won the @entity198 title earlier this week which is an amazing achievement			1
i am very happy about it			0
they were rewarded with the @entity203 award on wednesday night which was great to see because they fully deserve it			0
i was at the ceremony because it was held here in @entity125 , and i am an ambassador , so it was nice to be there			0
we face @entity212 in the @entity213 next week which could be very exciting			1
@entity212 are n't at the top of their game at the moment so hopefully we will beat them , and i am confident that we can			1
ambassador : @entity3 with future wife @entity218 at this week 's @entity219 in @entity125 @entity3 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity222 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity4 mechanics and their families , putting @entity4 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			0
you can follow @entity3 on @entity234 @ nico_rosberg and @entity6 @ @entity235 .			2

my @entity6 team did n’t really celebrate winning the @entity8 @entity9
victory in @entity50 was n’t as straightforward as it seemed
it ’s a big pity @entity77 got disqualified in season opener
the @entity22 @entity9 is one of the toughest races because of the humidity . i sweat up to four litres - double a regular race
i ’m confident @entity196 will beat @entity212 in the @entity213
