by @entity0 last updated at 11:59 am on 2nd march 2012 it is a common occurrence up and down the country every day			0
groups of mothers with their children get together for a chat and a cup of tea or coffee			1
but mothers who attend one weekly coffee morning have been left furious after health and safety chiefs banned hot drinks from their event			1
not happy : mums who attend a weekly coffee morning have been left furious after health and safety chiefs banned hot drinks from their event			2
pictured is @entity18 with her children @entity19 and @entity21 volunteers have been ordered to change the name of the friday morning sessions from ‘ coffee and play ’ to just ‘ @entity26 ’			1
biscuits have also been replaced by healthy snacks including fruit and bread sticks			0
parents attending the @entity32 in @entity33 , must now catch up over a plastic cup of water			0
the weekly 90 - minute sessions have been running for five years for children aged 18 months and under and no toddler has ever been injured in that time			1
but last week @entity39 introduced the ban after it ruled hot drinks were a hazard to toddlers			1
parents have now branded the ban ' health and safety madness '			2
one young mother , who did not want to be named , said : ' the hot drinks were never served in a cup or a mug			2
controversial : biscuits at the weekly event at @entity51 have also been replaced by healthy snacks including fruit and bread sticks ' they were served in what i regard as a " no spill plastic safety cup " with a lid			1
' there were almost like flasks , with a very small opening			0
everyone is just a bit disappointed			0
' i know it probably does n’t seem much , but having a cup of tea or coffee is quite a nice social thing to do as a new mum			0
' does this mean i should n’t be drinking a cup of coffee in the comfort of my home ? ' to me the ban is yet another example of health and safety madness			2
' children ’s centres across @entity39 can now only serve hot drinks if they are in a separate area from the toddlers			2
mum - of - two @entity84 , 30 , said : ' what the council are saying is if a parent wants a cuppa they must turn their back on their child and walk across to another area of the children ’s centre to make it and drink it			1
' surely it is more dangerous to leave your child unattended than it is to have a cup of tea on a table next to you while you watch them			0
' @entity105 , children ’s centre officer at the council , defended the ban			0
she said : ' to minimise any risk of scalding a child we have introduced a hot drinks policy at all of the county ’s children ’s centres			1
' hot drinks can now only be served at children and baby sessions if the layout of the centre provides a separate area to consume hot drinks away from children playing			1
' @entity122 , spokeswoman for the @entity32 added : ' all families using the centre were informed about this change of arrangements and we invited their feedback			0
' the majority of responses we have received have been positive and supportive as parents understand we want to minimise the chance of any harm being caused to their child			0

mothers forced to change ' @entity139 ' sessions to ' @entity26 '
sessions ran for five years in @entity51 and no child was injured by a hot drink
