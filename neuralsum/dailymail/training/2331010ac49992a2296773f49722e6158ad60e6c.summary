by @entity0 published : 13:41 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 06:58 est , 26 august 2013 the only strip club to successfully become unionized and the first to function as a stripper - run co-operative has announced it is closing its doors after its landlord refused to re-sign the lease			1
the venerable @entity6 first opened in @entity9 's @entity8 area in the @entity11 strip club district of @entity8 in the 1970s			1
the club 's landlord is @entity14 , a strip - joint magnate who is a partner in @entity15 , @entity16 , which owns most of the adult theaters and clubs in @entity9			1
grinding to a halt : the @entity9 @entity6 was given two weeks notice to close its doors motley crew : the @entity6 is known for employing a diverse range of dancers who do n't fit into the perma - tanned blond mold @entity25 business partner is @entity26 , known as the ' @entity27 of @entity28 '			1
according to sfgate , @entity26 's name does not appear on city permit applications for @entity15 , @entity16 's clubs in @entity9 , which are solely attributed to @entity25			1
investigators are now determining whether @entity25 is the sole owner of the company 's interests in @entity35 , because state liquor licensing laws state that all ownership must be disclosed			0
@entity15 , @entity16 , has been quietly taking over many of the city 's strip clubs and night spots			2
the club was the second opened by two business associates , the first being @entity6 in @entity43 , which closed in 2010 citing the financial climate and the online pornography industry for its closure			2
originally , the clubs showed 16mm peep show films , but in 1983 live nude dancers were introduced			0
peepshow : private booths , where customers watch dancers , line the corridors at the @entity6 club co-op : dancer @entity57 reviewing time - cards in the office before her shift onstage in 1997 , following several grievances , the @entity6 became the only successfully unionized sex business in @entity63			1
its dancers , nicknamed @entity65 , differ from the usual blonde , pneumatic and tanned women in mainstream strip - joints and are known for their unusual monikers such as @entity70 and @entity71			1
multi-tasking : dancers at the @entity6 undertake all areas of the running of the business - including its artwork after its owners decided to close the business , the club 's workers bought the club for $ 400,000 in 2003			1
two years earlier , in 2001 , @entity25 had acquired the building housing the @entity6 and more than doubled its rent			0
@entity14 , 71 , told the @entity83 that he 's not evicting the @entity6 because it 's a competitor to his other businesses , which number eight strip clubs just in the @entity6 's @entity8 neighborhood , but because of a default on rent			1
' if i was concerned about [ the competition ] , i ’ve had that building fifteen years now , i could have found a way not to extend their lease for the last ten , ” he told @entity83			0
the @entity95 disagree , saying , ' you can say it was because you ’re delinquent on rent … but the truth is that there ’s $ 80,000 that walks through this door every month that , once you close , is likely going to go to one of [ @entity25 ’s ] other establishments in the neighborhood , ” said @entity106 ' @entity105 ' @entity104 , the @entity6 ’s general manager			1
one @entity6 worker , identified only as @entity109 , was more direct : ' our landlord is a dildo and did n’t want to negotiate , ' she told @entity83			2
unlike the dancers at @entity25 ' clubs who actually pay the club for their stage time and work as independent contractors , the @entity95 belong to the @entity120 and earn hourly wages and overtime			2
according to sfgate , @entity26 , @entity25 and their companies have recently been named in a federal lawsuit that alleges the ' leases ' they force their lap dancers to sign for their stage time are a scam designed to avoid their legal responsibility to pay minimum wage and employment taxes			0
' @entity26 and @entity25 have created an elaborate scheme of corporations , business entities , trusts , straw men , consulting agreements and licensing agreements , all for the specific purpose of concealing their ownership , operation or control of these clubs , and avoid compliance with various federal and state labor laws , ' said the suit , filed in april on behalf of five @entity15 dancers			2
save the last dance : the dancers at the @entity6 are all stake - holders in the business , which is set to close in early september many see this latest closure of a @entity9 institution as a sign the city is losing the eclectic small businesses and liberal attitude that has made it so culturally rich			1
a message on the @entity168 page reads : ' @entity169 in the @entity170 , it is with shaking hands & tear stained cheeks that i write to say , we just heard from our land lord , they will not agree to a new lease , they are closing our doors			0
they have given us just two weeks			0
@entity181 doors and say goodbye on 9/2/13 please help us spread the word , and make it a glorious & glamorous two weeks ! thank you so much for all the love and support over the years ! - the @entity95 ' the two @entity6 strip clubs spawned numerous books , articles and film references			2
@entity192 , who worked in the @entity9 @entity6 documented her experiences there in the 2001 book @entity195 : a stripper 's @entity196			2
@entity198 apart : @entity6 dancers provided a counterpoint to the industry 's standard ' look ' @entity204 ladies : ( left to right ) @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 pose outside the front of the @entity6 strip club in @entity9 on june 27 , 2003 when it first became a co-op @entity213 farewell : the @entity6 website announced its upcoming closure recently another @entity6 alumnus @entity216 , @entity217 , also wrote about the club in @entity219 : chronicles of a @entity221			1
she told blogger @entity223 : ' when i began there in 1990 , it already had a reputation of hiring interesting , edgy women who would not necessarily have fit at other clubs			1
we had punks , dykes , women ’s studies majors plus one sexology grad student , me			0
' a worker at the club , named @entity236 $ $ told the @entity83 that if people want to keep their small local strip clubs , they should support them financially			0
' i tell people , if there ’s a local place they love , hollah with a dollah			0
you ca n’t pay the rent with @entity168 likes , ' she said			0
@entity6 workers once described the worker - owned strip club business model as ' a rare and ideal situation ' but ' not without its challenges , ' but it seems the club could n't overcome its biggest challenge , rising rents and increasing homogenization that has touched even the stripping industry			1
dancer @entity258 told @entity223 that even though the club is closing , the ideals it embraced will live on			0
' despite this pitfall i feel that the @entity6 has started a revolution for the rights of sex workers everywhere			0
and i feel that this revolution will continue long after we ’re gone			0

the landlord of a @entity9 icon , the @entity6 , has refused to re-sign the club 's lease
the @entity6 is the only unionized and worker - owned strip club in the @entity63
the club 's landlord , @entity14 , owns almost all the clubs in the city - including the one next door
@entity25 denies evicting the club to poach its business
the club 's workers say @entity14 refused to negotiate and plans to expand his ' @entity286 ' strip club next door
the club is known for hiring interesting , edgy dancers who do n't fit into the usual generic pneumatic blond mold
