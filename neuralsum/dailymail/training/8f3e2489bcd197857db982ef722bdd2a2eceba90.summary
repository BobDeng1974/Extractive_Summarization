by @entity0 my @entity2 brother : @entity4 poses with @entity5 in the @entity6 as a @entity2 , @entity5 always hankered for the quiet life - it was his eldest sister , @entity9 , told since she was a little girl that she could be the next @entity10 , who longed to be famous			1
neither of them got their wish			2
the former @entity2 died in november 2001 , leaving more than £ 100million in his will , as well as @entity15 , his huge @entity17 pile in @entity18 , just one of a number of lavish homes around the world			1
as for his big sister , she could n’t be further away from the 120 - room mansion splendour of his life - living alone at the age of 82 in a mobile home in @entity29 , @entity30 , and getting by on the uncertain income from a @entity2 tribute band she set up			1
the @entity34 were brought up to be self - reliant and @entity9 says she is not the type to whinge about her lot			1
she tells me she is financially ‘ struggling ’ but quickly adds : ‘ but would n’t you say everyone is ? ’ her one - bedroom mobile home - she has another next door - may not be worth very much , but at least she owns them and the land they are on , unlike the thousands with heavily mortgaged homes they ca n’t afford , she says			1
‘ @entity5 never enjoyed being rich - he said that @entity2 were just targets when they became rich and there was always some predator coming after them			1
every golddigger in the world was after @entity2 , ’ she says			2
‘ i did n’t want to become a millionaire after what happened to him			2
i wo n’t even buy a lottery ticket for fear of winning			2
’ she does n’t mind not living in a castle , she adds			2
she would rather be broke than wealthy and heartless			2
this is perhaps just as well since , as she revealed yesterday , not only was she completely left out of her brother ’s will , but the monthly $ 2,000 ( £ 1,250 ) pension he had set up for her in 1980 - and meant her to have for life - was cut off by his family estate without explanation			1
at the time she did n’t have a job and was living on social security - which in the @entity68 is not much - so it would have been quite a blow			1
she never discovered who took this somewhat heartless decision			2
she insists she has never asked @entity5 ’s widow , @entity74 , or his son , @entity75 , who received most of @entity5 ’s wealth			1
but she knows @entity5 would have been upset			2
a long way from @entity78 : the @entity29 , @entity30 , property that @entity4 calls home			1
she has lived in @entity68 for more than 50 years and says she wants nothing from the family of her famous brother beatle : @entity5 a year before his death at the @entity87 @entity86 in 2000 ( left ) , and during a rare public appearance in @entity89 in 1992 ‘ one of the things my brother said to me back in the @entity94 was that , given his circumstances , there was no reason on this earth why a sister of his should ever experience any financial hardship			1
’ she insists she does n’t care about the money or the implied slight from the family of a brother to whom she was once very close			1
‘ i was quite surprised , but i never argued about it , i just accepted it had been cancelled and got on with my life , ’ she says			2
@entity9 and @entity5 ’s parents taught them to pick themselves up if they fell			2
‘ i grew up in @entity112 during the air raids on @entity114			2
if someone drops a bomb on your house , you just move out and get on with things			2
just because you ’re living in a mobile home , it does n’t mean you ’ll be living there for the rest of your life , ’ she insists			1
and what about being left out of his will ? ‘ i was 11 years older than @entity5 and i do n’t think either of us expected he would die before me , ’ says @entity9			2
sprawling estate : @entity15 , the 120 - room home in @entity18 where @entity5 lived with his wife @entity74 and son , @entity75 , before he passed away in 2001 she may claim she ’s not curious , but others will surely be puzzled to find out why the sister of one of the most famous men in popular music should be living in a trailer in @entity30 , a state famous as the capital of the crystal meth drug industry			1
could her modest financial situation have had anything to do with the falling out she had with her brother , which led to them not speaking for six years ? she plays down the notion that there was a rift , although she concedes ‘ he might have been told some weird things about me ’			1
as children growing up in @entity114 ’s @entity155 district , the siblings had been extremely close and they remained on good terms during his early @entity2 days			0
by then - to borrow a line from the @entity2 - the itchy - footed @entity9 had started down a long and winding road			1
when we were @entity2 : @entity162 with @entity2 @entity163 @entity5 ( died november 2001 ) @entity161 ( died december 1980 ) and @entity164 on the set of the @entity166			1
1964 forbidden by her father from pursuing her dream of becoming a film star by going to stage school , she married @entity172 , a @entity173 mining engineer , when she was 25			0
they moved to @entity175 and then to @entity176 before settling in @entity177 , @entity178			0
when @entity2 formed , she was very excited for her brother			1
‘ i was running around radio stations trying to get their records played , ’ she recalls			0
‘ i was writing to their manager @entity182 every week with my research on the @entity68 music scene			0
' he ’d write back thanking me and asking if i could do the same for some of his other bands			0
i was really quite helpful in getting the band into the @entity68 ’ did she get any reward for that ? ‘ i did n’t need any reward			0
my kid brother had a band and i wanted to see them to succeed , ’ she says			1
she and @entity172 had two sons but divorced in 1970			0
she then moved to @entity198 where she spent a lot of time with @entity5 , staying at the ritzy plaza hotel and partying with him and @entity202			0
in @entity198 , where she briefly ran a travel business , she met her second husband , glass salesman @entity205			0
@entity205 got on famously with @entity5 and the couple would spend a month in @entity207 each year , staying at @entity5 ’s @entity15 home			1
all those years ago : @entity5 with his parents @entity209 and @entity4 at home in @entity114 but the marriage did n’t last and they split up in 1983			1
@entity9 says both her husbands were alcoholics			0
‘ when i got my second divorce , @entity5 said : “ do n’t go getting married , i ’ll take care of you ”			0
’ but instead of growing closer , they moved apart			0
insiders say the privacy - obsessed @entity5 distanced himself from his sister in the mid-nineties because he disapproved of the way she was exploiting her connection with him			1
she would be paid to speak at @entity2 conventions and in 1993 , when she asked him to join the board of a peace project she had set up , he refused			0
the final straw came two years later when her old home in @entity177 was converted into a @entity2 - themed @entity230 called a @entity231			1
@entity9 did n’t own the venture but did supply it with @entity2 memorabilia and helped publicise it			0
for the next six years until his death , they did n’t meet - despite several trips by the @entity2 to the @entity68 - and had minimal communication			1
but almost 20 years on , she questions whether her brother was ever really angry with her			1
‘ if @entity5 had really been upset about something , he could always have called me			0
’ but she concedes that many of her letters to him went unreplied			0
‘ i think he was just too busy , ’ she says			0
the pair did , however , have a final reconciliation			0
@entity9 drove hundreds of miles to see @entity5 at his hospital bedside in @entity248 , @entity198			0
there were reports that the desperately frail @entity5 initially refused to see her , but his wife made him change his mind			0
staggering : @entity207 rock group the @entity2 performing their last live public concert on the rooftop of the @entity258 @entity257 building for director @entity260 's film documentary , ' @entity261 , ' on @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 holding hands , the siblings chatted about old times for 90 minutes , laughing at how he used to be teased for his sticking - out ears			1
@entity9 , who still has another sibling , @entity270 , in @entity207 , says her @entity2 brother apologised to her			1
‘ you know , i could have been a lot more help to you ; i ’m sorry , ’ she later recalled him saying			0
he could , of course , have changed his will at that point but he did n’t			0
given his supposed views on the @entity230 , one wonders what @entity5 would have thought of her @entity2 tribute band , @entity280			0
@entity9 says she set it up only because she needed an income after losing the pension			1
‘ i wanted to get guys who looked and sounded as much like @entity2 as possible but i also wanted the kind of guys that if @entity5 was still here , they would be his friends			0
i ’ve always been very proud of how they ’ve turned out			0
i ’m more like their mum than their manager			0
’ @entity9 , who is a grandmother , moved from @entity178 to @entity29 about seven years ago , effectively to follow the band			1
the town has a profusion of live entertainment venues and they saw a gap in the market for a rock ’ n ’ roll band			0
however , business has been slow , she admits			0
‘ i am struggling for money , like everyone , but i am not on the breadline			0
i am not “ skint ” , as they would say in @entity207			0
i feel very fortunate to own outright the land that my two homes sit on - which is better than most , ’ she says			2
‘ i ’m 82 now and still in good health and good spirits			2
’ in some ways , her famous brother - who once told her of his dream to play guitar for just a handful of people in an obscure little bar - would be jealous of her modest but anonymous life , she says .			1

@entity4 , 82 , now lives alone in a mobile home in @entity29 , @entity30
she has received a £ 1,250 - a - month pension by her brother since 1980
but it was recently cut off without explanation
however , she insists she is happy and wants nothing from the rest of her family , who *inherited* his £ 100million fortune
