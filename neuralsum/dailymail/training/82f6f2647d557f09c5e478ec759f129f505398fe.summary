an unfortunate ball boy was left winded and wincing after being struck in the groin by a @entity2 serve during the @entity4 's second - round match with @entity6 @entity5 at the @entity7			1
@entity2 had served at an estimated speed of 200km/h and the ball boy had no chance to move out of the way			2
grimacing in pain the stunned ball boy spun around after being hit and briefly tried to walk it off			0
but he was soon down on one knee to get his breath back as a worried @entity2 watched on			0
there was no way the ball boy could get out of the way of @entity2 's 200km/h serve the ball boy reacts too late and the ball spins away after it hits him in the tenderest of places the ball boy does his best to regain his composure after the incident , kneeling down to catch his breath the umpire and players stood around the teenager giving words of encouragement , but they could do little to ease his pain			1
minutes later he was forced from the court as an anxious @entity2 walked along with him			0
ironically it was n't the only retirement of the match as @entity2 moved into the third round after @entity5 called it quits in the fourth set , despite leading two sets to one			2
at least in the poor ball boy 's case he probably had a much stronger reason not to play on			0
a worried @entity2 of @entity47 can only look on and hope that the ball boy is ok after the incident @entity2 and his opponent @entity5 of @entity6 try to comfort the injured ball boy on the ground in the end the ball boy is accompanied from the court by the the umpire and @entity2			1
