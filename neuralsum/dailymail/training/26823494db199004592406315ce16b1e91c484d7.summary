whether you use serums , oil or gels , for most of us , lovely locks are an everyday essential			0
but for the @entity7 tribe who live along @entity10 's northeastern border with @entity11 and @entity12 , the pursuit of a gorgeous ' do involves one very unusual ingredient			1
their distinctive ' asdago ' afro hairstyle is created using butter , which lends their locks a slightly ashy appearance as well as protecting it from the sun and keeping it perfectly supple			1
and it 's not just asdago hairdos that benefit from a spot of butter : another look , the ' dayta ' , also relies on dairy as a means of keeping the elaborate curls , created using a stick , in place			1
elaborate : this man 's intricate dayta hairstyle bears clear traces of the large amount of buttery unguent needed to create it looking good : an @entity7 man shows off his buttered asdago haircut , accessorised with a natty beaded grip			1
using butter on hair is common among the @entity7 tribe view from the back : a man shows off his elaborate dayta hairstyle , which is created using a long stick to make the curls that are held in place using butter elaborate : the datya hairstyle starts life as an asdago afro but is transformed into an elaborate curled affair using a long stick and liberal amounts of butter effective : the liberal use of butter keeps curls in place for days , as well as keeping hair supple and moisturised and helping to protect the scalp from the sun ' they apply the butter to keep the curls in place , ' explains photographer @entity69			1
' they look a little bit like @entity73 ladies , or , if you prefer , @entity74			0
the curls are full of cow fat and butter			0
' the @entity7 , who are grouped into unique mini-kingdoms , each ruled by its own sultan , also like across the border in neigbouring @entity12 and suffered much persecution under the @entity86 regime			2
more than 20 years after dictator @entity91 was forced to flee , the people 's fortunes - and talent for hairdressing - have recovered , although like other tribes living traditional lifestyles , they are under threat from encroaching modernity			1
impressive though the @entity7 ' grasp of hair dressing is , they are n't the only @entity10 to use butter to keep their hair in tip top condition			1
the @entity101 , are an ancient nomadic group who live in the @entity103 in the @entity105 district of @entity10 , also create elaborate looks using the foodstuff			2
sadly , like the @entity7 , their way of life is also under threat , largely as a result of persecution during the last century of their ethnic parent group , the @entity115 , as well as the establishment of national parks and the construction of sugar and cotton plantations which have deprived them of their land			2
accessories : the asdago hairstyle , the starting point for the more elaborate dayta hairdo , is often accessorised with beautifully beaded hairpins colourful : a group of afar people show off their elaborate hairstyles and beautifully bright patterned textiles			0
they also carry traditional weapons looking ahead : although encroaching modernity is the greatest threat to the @entity7 way of life , the people are n't averse to embracing innovations such as sunglasses @entity142 : the @entity7 tribe is divided into kingdoms , each with its own sultans - all of whom make a living from their cattle persecuted : the @entity7 tribe suffered appallingly under the regime of dictator @entity91 but their fortunes - and hairdressing skills - have since recovered traditional : men from the @entity101 tribe cover their beautifully cut afro hairstyles , known as gunfura , with butter as a means of keeping the look in place dwindling : thanks to land grabs , the @entity101 , famed for their hairstyle and their traditional @entity166 ceremony , are facing an uncertain future tribesman from the @entity101 tribe wear their head in a distinctive afro hairstyle called a gunfura , and will make a hole in it when married and add butter to it unique : newlywed @entity178 young men make a hole in their gunfura and put some butter in the morning , which runs down their necks as they go about their business the @entity101 also practice the @entity166 system , an ancient and complex form of @entity187 democracy which is traditionally based on the passing on of power from one generation to another every eight years			1
the rules , which divide the tribespeople into around 11 strictly - observed group , governs the life of individuals in @entity115 society from birth to death , controlling everything from economics , art , history , property ownership and making laws			0
every eight years under a full moon , around 10,000 people - strictly no tourists - gather for the @entity166 ceremony to transfer power from one group to the next			0
there 's no such prohibition on watching the @entity101 hairdressers at work however , creating intricate looks that can take up to a day to complete			0
' @entity178 young men who are newly married make a hole in their " gunfura " ( afro haircut ) and put some butter in the morning , reveals @entity69			1
' all day long , the butter goes through the hair and down in the neck			0
it 's natural for them ! ' and the buttery look is n't reserved solely for the men , as @entity69 points out : ' @entity229 girls also put butter on the hair			1
sometimes you can see the men from the family spitting on the top of the head full of butter , which , although it sounds disgusting , is actually a blessing			0
' blessing : a man blesses his sister by spitting on the top of her head as her hairdo is completed and right , a man neatens up his friend 's hairdo a young girl from the @entity229 tribe makes some shampoo with butter			0
sometime men from her family will spit on her butter - covered head , which is seen as a blessing @entity254 women use butter and red soil to put on their dreadlocks and often put some much on that it runs down their backs , looking similar to blood other tribes to embrace butter has an unguent for hair include the @entity265 , who believe it protects their scalps from the sun , and the @entity254 , who mix it with red ochre to spectacular effect			1
the @entity273 , a semi-nomadic tribe of cattle herders , have a set of unique rituals surrounding the use of butter as a beauty product			1
the food is most often used by newly - wed women , who are completely covered in a butter and ochre mixture and shut in their home alone for six months after the wedding to ensure that any child she has belongs to her husband			1
but it 's not solely a wedding tradition : women also use the mixture to keep their dreadlocks in place			0
' @entity254 women use butter and a little red soilto put on their dreadlocks , explains @entity69			2
' they put so much that it streams down the back and looks a lot like blood			0
' to keep the look tidy , regular haircuts are also on offer , although as @entity69 explains , they are n't of the type found in a high street salon			0
' they take a stone and a knife to cut them with , ' he explains			0
' a few minutes and it is done ! ' elaborate : @entity254 women use a mixture of butter and red ochre to keep their dreadlocks neatly in place			2
they are cut using a knife and a stone elegant : the @entity254 's hairstyle of choice is also a practical one , with the mud and butter mixture keeping locks out of the eyes as they do their work intricate : the full extent of the talent needed to create the delicate braids is revealed in this pair of stunning photos			2

the @entity7 tribe is famous for its butter - covered ' asdago ' afro styles and elaborately curled ' dayta ' ' do
but the @entity7 are n't the only ones to use dairy products as an unguent - the @entity339 and @entity254 also do
particularly spectacular is the look adopted by the @entity101 tribe who allow butter to drip through their hair
all four tribes are cattle herders by tradition and make the butter that they use on their hair by hand
although many of their *compatriots* use shea butter , for the @entity7 and @entity254 , using real butter is traditional
