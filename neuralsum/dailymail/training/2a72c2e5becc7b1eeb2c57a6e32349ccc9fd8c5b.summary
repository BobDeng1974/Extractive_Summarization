by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 called on @entity3 fans to roar his team to the @entity7 group stages after they secured a worthy 1 - 1 draw in @entity1			1
@entity9 was the goal hero once again as he fired @entity3 into a sixth - minute lead			1
while @entity1 punished slack defending and equalised through @entity13 soon after , there was little prospect of a repeat of @entity3 ’s @entity17 capitulation which saw them ship four goals after @entity9 had also given them the perfect start			1
12th man : @entity3 manager @entity2 hopes the fans can cheer his side to victory next week now very much in the driving seat , @entity2 is relishing the prospect of the return leg of the play - off encounter and his first experience of a @entity30 night at @entity31 after the temporary home at @entity33			1
‘ that is one of the advantages , we play them at home and i saw on saturday how much it means for the players , ’ he said			2
‘ it is important now that people meet up and give us everything , the way @entity31 is			2
‘ we have a big chance now			2
‘ the second leg is going to be a tough game			1
it could be that @entity1 are more dangerous away than at home because they will play in the same way			1
‘ we have to play with the right balance and attack them the right way			2
but of course we have the advantage of playing at @entity31 and that ’s what we are going to use to get through to the group stages			2
i have a good feeling we can reach it			0
’ after being handed a shock reprieve in the competition thanks to @entity64 ’s administrative blunder , @entity3 last night were a far more composed and controlled force than they had been in the 6 - 1 reverse to the @entity68			1
chance : @entity9 ( right ) is hailed by @entity70 after opening the scoring for @entity3 and @entity2 insisted his side were unfortunate not to travel back to @entity73 with a win			1
‘ i think we were closer to winning than they were , ’ he said			0
‘ but i think the performance was good and we worked very hard for 90 minutes			2
‘ we got into the game in the right way so i am pleased			0
it is going to be very exciting to play them now at @entity31 on tuesday			0
‘ i am very pleased with the performance today			0
we were well prepared and we knew what we were going to meet			0
the players were fantastic for 90 minutes			2
‘ there are things to work on but we are looking like a team now			0
we are working hard and creating chances			0
1 - 1 was a good result but i think we could have won the game			1
‘ we knew they were going to sit deep because we had seen a lot on video and you know what you can expect			0
they are very good on the counter attacks and they showed they are also good to go through the middle			0
but we kept them away for long periods and we created chances ourselves so i am happy today			0
’ back in the game : the @entity1 team celebrate @entity106 ' goal after 14 minutes goal hero @entity9 was singled out for special praise in what was a strong team performance			1
the 20 - year - old , who spent last season on loan at @entity113 , made it four goals in seven games after being given his first - team chance this season			2
‘ he is a fantastic player , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ he works both ways , good in defence and in offence so again a very good player and today he performed fantastic			0
‘ we can be proud he is a product of the @entity3 youth department			1
’ at the other end , @entity126 also stood strong when @entity1 threatened to take advantage of any slackness			1
blameless for the goal which came through weak defending on @entity3 ’s part , @entity2 said of his keeper : ‘ you see every day the hunger he has and wants to get back to the level where he was			1
i think he is almost there now			0
‘ i believe he is an experienced keeper who is calm and knows how to focus and he is a leader in the group now			0
‘ he is so calm when he stands in the goal , he is athletic so i am pleased with him as well today			0

@entity2 hopes @entity3 fans can cheer his side to victory against @entity1
