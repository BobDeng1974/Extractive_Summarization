a great white shark heading for @entity3 waters could be bringing some smaller ferocious fish with her , scientists have revealed			1
the deadly predator – named @entity6 – became the first tagged great white shark to cross the @entity8 and scientists charting her progress have now revealed that the 15ft shark might be swimming towards @entity12 to give birth to pups			1
she is just 800 miles ( 1,255km ) off the coast of @entity16 and @entity17 in the @entity18 and has now turned away from the @entity3			1
she is currently headed west ( pictured ) but experts believe the shark is pregnant and in search of a nursery for her pups and could be en route to the @entity28 very little is known about the reproduction of great white sharks			1
great white sharks are thought to reach sexual maturity aged around 15			1
the oldest female ever recorded was 40 years old			0
the predators are ovoviviparous which means that eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth			2
the great white shark has an 11 month gestation period and the pups ' jaws start to form at one month			1
unborn sharks feed on ova produced by the mother and are born in spring and summer			2
mother sharks typically give birth to between two and 12 pups			1
but experts think she may be aiming for @entity50 in search of a nursery in the long - run			1
@entity6 , who weighs 2,000lb ( 907kg ) has covered more than 19,400 miles in the past year since being fitted with a tracking device			1
she is being tracked as part of a ground - breaking marine life study by @entity57 that aims to learn more about sharks ' movements			2
scientists have been following the ferocious fish for over a year and her progress can be followed on the project ’s website			0
‘ @entity6 pinged in this morning headed @entity65 ! ’ researchers tweeted this morning			2
experts say they are shocked by @entity6 ’s recent dash towards @entity12 and she has travelled 313 miles in the past 72 hours			1
@entity69 , expedition leader and founding chairman of the @entity72 shark tagging project , said @entity6 may be looking for somewhere to rear young			2
he said : ‘ i would guess that @entity6 is pregnant and that she has been out in the open ocean gestating her babies and that this spring she will lead us to where those baby white sharks are born - the nursery			1
’ he thinks her chosen location may end up being off the coast of @entity50			0
record breaker : the deadly predator has become the first tagged shark of its species to cross the @entity8 , an enormous underwater mountain range under the ocean			1
she is currently swimming to the west ( pictured ) deadly cargo : tagging the shark ( pictured ) was a feat in itself , with heavy machinery used to hoist @entity6 from the water in order to fit the tracking device the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) is a ridge found along the floor of the @entity18			1
this rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates , where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor , erupting as lava and producing new crustal material for the plates			0
it forms part of the longest mountain range in the world and separates the @entity112 and @entity113 in the @entity18 , and the @entity114 from the @entity115 in the @entity18			0
@entity116 normally give birth to between two and 12 pups at a time after a gestation period of 11 months			1
blood samples did n't show @entity6 was pregnant when researchers used a 34,000kg hydraulic platform to hoist her from the water to fit her tracking device			2
but mr @entity69 , who has led numerous ocean expeditions , said there is uncertainty over how exactly @entity128 reproduce			2
‘ the sperm from the male comes in a packet with a shell on it			0
they [ the female sharks ] can carry it around for a while until a special organ inside them breaks down the shell and they get pregnant			0
‘ we know its 18 months from when we discover the breeding aggregation to when they lead us to the nursery			0
‘ what we do n't know is how long they carry that sperm packet and how long is it until their body breaks down the shell			0
’ @entity6 had been heading north but made a sharp turn back towards the @entity153 @entity155 bookkeepers revealed odds of 2 - 1 for @entity6 visiting @entity16 as her first port of call			1
@entity6 has become the first tagged great white to cross the @entity8 ( pictured ) - an underwater mountain range which separates the @entity112 and @entity161 - at around 10am on march 9 her gps tag only gives off a signal when she 's near the water 's surface so scientists sometimes have to wait days between new readings			1
mr @entity69 said it was impossible to predict where she 'll head next			0
he said : ‘ if you forced me to guess where that was , i 'd say it was over in the @entity28 , near @entity50 - but that 's long - ball i 'm playing			2
‘ she could turn around right now and head back to @entity174			0
’ she became the first tagged great white to cross the @entity8 - an underwater mountain range which separates the @entity112 and @entity113 tectonic plates - on the morning of march 9			1
great whites are traditionally tracked off the coasts of @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , the west coast of @entity153 from @entity184 up to @entity185 , the @entity186 and @entity187			1
shark biologist @entity188 tweeted : ‘ @entity6 pinged in on the other side of @entity196 ! welcome to the history books , # @entity6 , ’ while @entity69 , who is involved in the project , tweeted : ' # @entity6 turns @entity190 toward # @entity3 continuing first doc @entity193 migration n hist ! ’ @entity6 was tagged by the @entity72 project , which aims to monitor sharks to learn more about their movements dr @entity202 , 52 , senior fisheries biologist with @entity203 , said : ‘ i have no idea what to expect from her next			1
i 've been working with sharks for a very long time now and i have never seen anything like this			0
' ‘ it 's anyone 's guess where she is going to go next but she has been heading east so she might continue to do so			0
’ ‘ she 's just short of 800 miles away from your coast now but in the grand scheme of things that really is n't far for her			1
it 's all very exciting			0
‘ it 's hard to say how long it might take her to get there			0
if she decides she wants to get to @entity221 she could get there in days			0
‘ having said that , she is quite likely to meander			0
it could take her days , it could take her months , or it might not happen at all			0
‘ i think it would be great to see her turn up in the @entity3 though			0
’ though @entity6 's journey is impressive , great whites are known for their marathon migrations			1
in 2003 a great white nicknamed @entity230 travelled from @entity180 to @entity181 and back - some 12,400 miles			1
in recent years there have been several sightings of great whites off the coast of @entity3			1
in september last year , fisherman @entity234 said he had spotted a 14ft beast swimming close to his boat off the coast of @entity238 in southern @entity16			2
the suspected sighting came just a day after a fisherman on board a lobster boat said he spotted a ' giant shark ' get close to his vessel			2
all those who witnessed the shark dismissed the idea it could be a basking shark , saying the creature was much larger , prompting experts to consider the possibility it was a great white			1
great white sharks are the largest predatory fish in the world , reaching up to 20ft in length and more than 4,400lb in weight			1
satellite tracking of the giant species has afforded researchers and scientists more accurate information about their habits and long - distance journeys			2
the @entity265 has tagged around 100 sharks since 2009			2
the study has shown that great whites can travel up to 3,000 miles in three months			1
they are traditionally tracked off the coasts of @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , the west coast of @entity153 from @entity184 up to @entity185 , the @entity186 and @entity187			0
the creatures have a ferocious reputation but are responsible for between a third and a half of the average 100 shark attacks across the world each year			0
they are highly adapted predators , detecting a single drop of blood in 100 litres of water up to three miles away			0
their mouths are lined with around 300 serrated teeth , arranged across several rows			0
gathering speed and approaching their prey from beneath , great whites can leap clear of the water , breaching like whales to attack			1
they commonly feed on sea lions , seals , small toothed whales , and sea turtles			0
the predators live for up to 25 years and eat around 11 tonnes of food each year			0
if food is scarce , the sharks will try to avoid fighting , instead engaging in a tail - slapping contest along the surface of the water			2
the winner delivers the most slaps			0
scientists do not have a reliable idea of the species ' population across the world , but agree their number are decreasing due to overfishing and sharks being caught accidentally in nets			0
they are listed as an endangered species .			0

on *friday* , @entity6 was spotted 1,000 miles from @entity16 and @entity17
the satellite - tagged 15ft , 2,000lb great white is around 800 miles away after she crossed the @entity8 ridge found in the *middle* of the ocean
today gps tag showed she is heading west , but experts think the shark is looking for a nursery in the @entity28 where she can raise some pups
great white sharks typically give birth to between two and 12 pups
@entity6 became the first tagged great white to cross the @entity8
no one understands why she is taking such a *strange* route as great whites are usually found in warmer waters
