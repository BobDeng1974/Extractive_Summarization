@entity0 are prepared to pay an increase on the £ 10million fee they have agreed with @entity4 to accelerate @entity6 ’s release in january			1
the @entity7 forward , whom @entity8 believes will be a ‘ world - class striker ’ , joined @entity0 in august but was immediately loaned back to @entity4 to continue his development before heading to @entity12 next summer			1
but such is @entity0 ’s keenness to bring @entity16 in , they would be ready to pay a premium to get him in the new year			1
@entity8 ’ side have been desperately short of goals , with @entity21 missing 14 games through injury and @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 struggling			2
@entity7 's @entity6 , second left , scores the second goal against @entity30 on wednesday night @entity16 ( right ) celebrates with team - mates after his goal against @entity30 at the @entity35 stadium @entity4 , however , have given no indication that they would be willing to re-jig the original terms of the deal , which meant he would stay the full season in @entity41 , and hand @entity16 to @entity0 early - even if the 19 - year - old has admitted he would be happy to move in january			1
‘ it is not me who makes the decisions but if the club choose to let me go in january i would go , i would like to join @entity0 then , ’ said @entity6 , who scored for @entity7 in their 3 - 1 win over @entity30 on wednesday			1
‘ i said i would stay for the whole season and i wish to remain honourable in that , of course			0
but if there was a decision by the clubs , i would not say i would n’t like to go to @entity0 in january			1
@entity8 is in contact , he ( speaks ) regularly , he wants to know how i am feeling			0
‘ it makes me feel very good and wanted			0
also the medical staff , they stay in touch for the same reason – to keep me involved , telling me that they are looking forward to me coming to the club			0
if there was that chance of joining @entity0 sooner i would take it			2
@entity0 bought @entity16 from @entity4 for £ 10million but loaned him back to the @entity41 side for the season ‘ i would love to move to @entity0 sooner rather than later			1
i am here at @entity4			2
it ’s fine , they are a good club and they have helped me			0
but i ca n’t wait to be playing in the @entity69 because i can now see that it will suit me better			2
i think there are good things waiting for me with @entity0			2
’ @entity6 , who has scored five goals in @entity41 this season , played for @entity4 in both their @entity75 matches against @entity76 recently			1
he has made a point of watching how @entity0 have fared and believes their current position in the @entity69 does not reflect their capabilities			1
‘ i have been following @entity0 closely , the events of what has been going on and i think they have had a difficult time , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ they have a team with a lot of talent , with a lot of good players			0
they also have a very , very good coach			0
‘ but they have had a lot of injuries and this has not helped them			0
it is difficult when you do not have a player like @entity21 , for instance			0
what i believe is that they just have to be more efficient but i also believe that it is only a matter of time before it comes			0
