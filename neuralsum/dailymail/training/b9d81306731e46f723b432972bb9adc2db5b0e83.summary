by @entity0 and @entity1 using confidential patient information from a controversial new @entity4 database for commercial purposes is to be barred in law			1
in an attempt to rescue the scheme , which has stalled amid widespread concern about potential threats to privacy , @entity7 will next week unveil a series of concessions			1
crucially , the health secretary will promise legislation to prevent personal information being shared for any ‘ purely commercial ’ purpose , for example with insurance firms			1
health secretary @entity7 will next week unveil a series of concessions to the @entity24 scheme			1
he will promise legislation to prevent personal information being used for ' purely commercial ' purposes , for example with insurance firms a requirement that a patient ’s opt - out must be respected will also be written into statute			1
critics will welcome the concessions – but many insist the government should go further and give patients the right to opt in , rather than requiring them to make the effort to opt out			0
the @entity40 has repeatedly highlighted growing concerns among gps and patients over the @entity24 project , which was due to begin next month			1
unless patients choose to opt out , confidential information about their illnesses , test results and medication will automatically be uploaded from their gp file to a central database			1
data to be extracted from gp systems includes family history , vaccinations , referrals for treatment , diagnoses and information about prescriptions			2
officials behind the £ 50million scheme say it will improve healthcare and promote medical advances , with researchers using the information to spot trends and identify poor care			0
but critics have raised concerns that the data could be misused – for instance , by firms providing health care insurance and life cover or trying to target particular products			0
now , in a significant move , government sources said new legislation would be introduced to prevent the @entity79 from sharing personal information where there is not a ‘ clear health or care benefit for people ’			2
anyone wishing to use the data will have to demonstrate an ‘ ethical basis ’ on which to do so before any application can be considered			0
this , the source said , puts ‘ beyond doubt ’ that identifiable or potentially identifiable patient data could be released to firms			0
such a use of the information is expected to become an offence under data protection law			0
there will also be legislation to beef up the powers of an expert committee that advises mr @entity7 on releasing identifiable or potentially identifiable patient data			2
dr @entity103 , of @entity105 surgery , @entity106 , said : ' @entity7 is still missing the point though			0
the scheme still puts the onus on the public to opt out if they do not wish to be a part of this ' a source close to the health secretary said : ‘ the principles around this programme , which will bring real benefits to patients , are fundamentally right , and we completely support them			1
‘ but , alongside a new campaign from @entity123 to explain the programme to the public and @entity42 , we also need to ensure that robust legislation is in place to address their concerns			0
’ mr @entity7 is understood to accept that certain critics , including some gps , will still be unhappy , but argues an opt - in system would be pointless due to an expected lack of take - up			2
but one doctor , whose practice was threatened with closure for vowing to opt his patients out of the scheme , called on mr @entity7 to introduce an opt - in system			1
dr @entity103 , of @entity105 surgery , @entity106 , said : ‘ at least by putting it on a statutory basis the government will reassure many of those who have doubts			0
‘ @entity7 is still missing the point though			0
the scheme still puts the onus on the public to opt out if they do not wish to be a part of this , rather than reversing it and saying , “ if you are happy with these conditions , please opt in ”			2
