as wildlife crime is on the rise , a newly - discovered method of recovering fingerprints from feathers and eggs could help catch those guilty , according to scientists			1
researchers at @entity9 based in @entity10 have established which fingerprint powders are most effective at developing fingermarks on the feathers and eggs of birds of prey			1
the discovery means that police can establish whether a bird or egg has been handled by a human			0
researchers at @entity9 , @entity10 have found a method of recovering fingerprints from feathers ( fingerprint on a golden eagle egg above ) and eggs that could help catch those guilty of wildlife crime the discovery of which powders are most effective at developing fingermarks ( a fingerprint on a red kite feather above ) means that police can establish whether a bird or egg has been handled by a human since 2006 , 2,578 incidents of bird crime involving or targeting wild birds of prey have been reported to the @entity43			1
@entity44 , a lecturer in forensic science at @entity9 , said until now , feathers were a surface where recovering fingerprints remained elusive along with human and animal skin			1
he said : ' we had heard anecdotally that it had been achieved and were keen to see if we could develop a method that produced consistent results and could be used by the police in an investigation			0
' he added : ' now , if the police examine a discarded bird of prey for fingerprints following our guidelines , any fingermarks that have been left there will become visible			2
' if a fingermark shows up , it is proof that the bird has been handled and suggests that it was discarded on someone else 's land as the perpetrator tried to get rid of the carcass			0
' even if they do n't manage to recover an identifiable fingermark , the presence of the mark means that they know exactly where to focus their attention to swab for dna and that this particular bird of prey had been handled by a human			2
six species of bird of prey feathers including the kestrel ( pictured left ) and seven species of bird prey eggs including the tawny owl ( pictured right ) were examined in the research ' so , we hope that this research will help the police in their endeavours to bring those guilty of wildlife crime to justice			1
' they will now be able to recover more evidence - and it will be evidence that could potentially link a suspect to the crime			0
' six species of bird of prey feathers ( kestrel , sparrowhawk , buzzard , red kite , golden eagle and white - tailed eagle ) and seven species of bird of prey eggs ( kestrel , sparrowhawk , golden eagle , goshawk , tawny owl , barn owl and long - eared owl ) were examined in the research			2
previously it had not been established which of the many different fingerprint powders available would work and there was always a risk of damaging the evidence			0
the results of the latest research showed that red and green magnetic fluorescent powders were the most successful at recovering fingerprints from feathers			1
black magnetic powder was the most successful at recovering fingermarks from eggs			1
the results of the latest research showed that red and green magnetic fluorescent powders were the most successful at recovering fingerprints from feathers			1
species of bird prey including the sparrowhawk ( above ) was also tested in the research @entity133 , head of investigations at @entity135 , welcomed the research			2
he said : ' since 1994 , almost 750 protected birds of prey have been confirmed as being the victims of illegal poisoning , shooting or trapping in @entity135			1
' this has included some of our rarest breeding species like golden eagles , hen harriers and red kites whose populations continue to be threatened by illegal killing			0
' while government laboratory testing has made it relatively straightforward to identify the cause of death of the victims in many cases , identifying the perpetrator of offences that often take place in some of the remotest areas of our countryside continues to be very difficult			0
' although there has been a reduction in the number of cases of illegal egg collection , the practice still exists and there is evidence that illegal egg collectors are now increasingly operating abroad			0
' this work carried out by @entity9 is a great step forward in the development of forensic techniques and can only assist in the fight against those who threaten some of our most iconic raptors			0
' full details of the methods used have been recorded in a research paper , which has been published in the journal @entity181 and is available online .			0
