by @entity1 reporter published : 04:08 est , 3 april 2012 updated : 06:25 est , 3 april 2012 two men who terrorised an old lady have been jailed after police used a ' facial mapping ' expert to confirm the identity of one of the suspects who had been captured by @entity10			1
@entity11 , 48 , and @entity12 , 42 , robbed an 81 - year old woman at her home in @entity15 , putting a pillow over her face to stifle her screams when she woke to find them in her bedroom at 5am			1
the pair were caught on @entity10 outside their victim 's flat at a sheltered housing complex in @entity25 , @entity15			1
@entity12 's face was partially obscured by his hood but his left cheek was visible			2
a forensic facial mapping scientist was called in to give a positive identification			0
facial mapping : officers noted the contours of @entity12 's left cheek using a still from the @entity10 image			1
they could then search a digital database for the closest match the pair ransacked the woman 's property and stole her handbag , which contained her £ 300 pension money			1
detective constable @entity43 explained , ' officers picked up the pair a couple of days after the robbery as they were acting suspiciously and wearing very similar clothes to the men caught on the @entity10 footage			1
' officers had noticed that in the @entity10 one of the faces was partially uncovered , so we took photographs of one suspect while he was in custody , from the same angle as the video footage			2
' a forensic facial mapping scientist examined both the @entity10 stills and the photographs we 'd taken and supported the prosecution 's case that one of the males in the @entity10 was @entity12			1
' on the day of the trial @entity12 pleaded guilty			0
@entity11 had earlier pleaded guilty as his fingerprints were found in the victim 's flat			2
both men were career villains with a string of convictions and the old lady was targeted because @entity12 knew where she lived , as his late father lived in the same complex			0
the woman told police : ' i was terrified i would be pulled out of the bed and kicked which would make me an invalid			0
i feared i would be raped or murdered			1
identified : @entity11 and @entity12 thought they had got away with their crime initially , but police closely examined the @entity10 footage and used a digital mugshot database to pinpoint the criminals ' however after they left i was able to deal with the incident in my mind as i ’m very religious			1
i believe the robbery was fate and sent to challenge my faith			0
' at @entity95 , @entity11 was jailed four years and five months and @entity12 was jailed for five years and eight months after both pleaded guilty to robbery			0
@entity98 said the aid occurred on august 9 2011 when the pensioner , who lives alone , woke up to find the men in her bedroom searching through her bedside drawer			2
they demanded money , then covered her face with a pillow to stop her from screaming			0
the woman ’s handbag was later found dumped on a nearby street without the money			0
detectives launched inquiries and managed to trace @entity10 footage which showed @entity11 and @entity12 walking towards the victim ’s flat at 5.09am			2
at 7.55am on sunday 14 august 2011 , police officers attended a report of men behaving suspiciously on bikes in @entity120 and arrested @entity11 and @entity12 in relation to other offences			0
@entity11 was wearing a blue top that was identical to the one being worn by one of the men on cctv footage near the victim ’s flat			0
grainy : the cctv of the suspects lurking outside the woman 's flat was captured on august 10 last year @entity11 ’s fingerprints were fast tracked whilst in custody and matched those recovered from the victim ’s flat			1
@entity12 , who had knowledge of the flat complex because his father previously lived there , was later recognised in further @entity10 footage that was recovered showing him without his his face being concealed			2
he denied it was him but a facial mapping expert ’s analysis report provided vital supporting evidence that it was him			0
detective constable @entity43 from @entity98 said : ' this was a terrible crime on a defenceless 81 - year - old lady woman who has been sadly affected as a direct result of @entity11 and @entity12 ’s actions			1
' to be woken and robbed in the middle of the night , in your own home , must be terrifying for anyone but especially an 81 - year - old single woman			1
' @entity98 will always relentlessly pursue anyone who commits this type of crime until they are brought to justice			0
