first former president @entity0 called him ' @entity2 ' at an influential gathering of @entity4			0
then @entity5 repeatedly botched his last name at an endorsement rally			0
she also confused him with his marine corps veteran father			0
last week the @entity9 misidentified the elected office he is seeking in an email to reporters			0
other politicians may have been offended by such high - profile flubs , but @entity16 rep. @entity15 , a @entity15 candidate for the @entity17 , told @entity18 he 's not offended that his prominent backers ca n't seem to get his personal details straight			1
' everyone makes mistakes , ' he said			0
@entity5 came back to @entity16 to stump for @entity15 for the second time this month after a disastrous first appearance at which she repeatedly called him by the wrong name @entity15 , left , shakes hands with a voter after casting his ballot in the @entity17 race on friday			1
@entity15 spent the weekend barnstorming the state , trying to visit as many of @entity16 's 99 counties as possible before the polls close the @entity16 lawmaker explained that he 's no stranger to having people mix up his last name			1
a local newspaper misidentified the last name of two of his three children , @entity44 , @entity46 and @entity47 , in their birth announcements , he said			0
' one of them was listed as @entity50			0
one of them was listed as @entity52 , ' he revealed			0
' these are honest mistakes that people make			0
' what 's more important is that people have been coming to @entity16 to help to inspire @entity16 voters to understand why this election is important , ' he continued			1
@entity15 pointed out that the first lady made jokes at her own expense about the gaffe when she returned to @entity16 to stump for him last week			1
' and you know what , @entity64 are understanding and forgiving because everyone makes mistakes , ' he said of the incident			2
@entity15 , a four - term congressman , is competing against @entity16 state senator @entity69 for the @entity16 's open @entity17 seat			1
their race is one of a handful that will determine whether @entity75 gain control of the legislative branch next year			1
@entity69 has beat out @entity15 in all but two surveys taken of @entity16 voters in the last month			1
in both instances , the lawmakers tied			0
polling site @entity81 continues to rank the competition as one in which either candidate could claim victory as @entity69 's lead has always been within the margin of error			2
with just nine days to go until the midterm elections , both candidates spent the better part of their sunday rushing around the state , trying to visit with voters in all 99 of @entity16 's counties			1
@entity69 began her day with an early morning pancake breakfast in her home town , @entity100 , a small town located in the southwestern part of the state			2
@entity15 's first public event was a meet - and - greet with canvassers in a suburb of @entity106			1
there he thanked them for their support and emphasized the importance of replacing retiring sen. @entity112 with a politician who will carry on the @entity4 lawmaker 's legacy			0
notably absent from his stump speech was a call to action to support the embattled @entity4 leader , president @entity118 , by voting for himself and other @entity16 @entity4			0
still , the @entity75 has played up the @entity4 candidate 's ties to president @entity118			2
a video released by the state 's @entity75 last week asked voters to ' send @entity118 a message ' by voting ' no on his handpicked candidate @entity15			1
' @entity69 has not bet the farm on the @entity128 strategy like @entity75 hopefuls in other states have , however			1
while she has hit @entity15 on his vote for @entity135 and his support for the president 's other ' failed policies ' that she says have driven up the national debt , the conservative 's message has largely focused on her own qualifications			1
she has attracted positive attention with quirky ads highlighting her background in agriculture , the state 's most important industry			1
standing in a pig sty , the @entity75 said in a march commercial , ' i 'm @entity69			1
i grew up castrating pigs on an @entity16 farm , so when i get to @entity152 , i 'll know how to cut pork			0
' the video went viral on the web and propelled her to victory in the @entity75 primary for the @entity17			1
it also put her and the @entity26 race , which was initially considered a lock for @entity15 , on the map			2
in a sequel ad released last week @entity69 revisited the hog theme and compared @entity165 to a bunch of pigs			0
' it 's a mess			0
dirty , noisy , and it stinks			0
not this lot , i 'm talking about the one in @entity152 , ' the state legislator says as she 's surrounded by pigs			0
' too many politicians , hogging , wasting , and full of ... well let 's just say , bad ideas , ' @entity69 adds as the camera pans to an oinking pig covered in manure			2
while the ads have by and large received positive attention , @entity69 's detractors have lodged complaints that they are not specific enough , and @entity16 @entity4 have claimed that she would support a radical @entity186 agenda if elected			1
@entity69 hit back at her critics on sunday in an interview with @entity18			2
' i would not say they 're lacking in substance because the overall goals , cut spending , repeal and replace @entity135 , those are pretty good goals to have			0
' furthermore , she said , ' you ca n't ... lay out in a 30 - second ad really what , what your achievements would be in a @entity17 seat			1
' @entity69 argued that the ads have served their intended purpose			2
' so many people are relating to those ads , ' she said			0
' the hogs that we 've had in the ads , very creative but fun , but it 's agriculture , ' she said			2
' and so many people have come up to me and they 've said , " you know @entity69 , i used to do that when i was a kid , too			2
" ' you know , it 's just part of growing up on a farm in an ag area , ' she said of hog castration			0
@entity69 has also made her military service a focal point of her campaign and has used it as a cudgel against her opponent , who did not serve in the armed forces			0
the @entity229 veteran and @entity230 member reminded friends and family this morning that she was one of those boots on ground in @entity229			0
' so i understand what 's going in that region of the world , ' she told the 50 or so attendees of the sunday am event			0
' and understanding our military affairs is something that is extremely important at a time like today , when we are seeing crises in @entity229 , @entity245 and @entity246 , in @entity247 , in @entity248			0
' there are so many areas that you have mentioned			0
yet we have congressman @entity15 and @entity118 , they are reactive rather than proactive , she argued			2
' so i believe that we need someone that has served her country , her community and her state serving in the @entity17			2
' @entity260 gov. @entity259 , right , greets @entity69 , the @entity75 nominee from @entity16 to the @entity17 , at a birthday bash fundraiser for @entity16 gov. @entity262 on saturday night			1
@entity16 has become a popular place for for @entity75 and @entity4 thinking about running for president to cut their teeth this year because of the competitive federal election @entity69 did not link her opponent to senate majority leader @entity269 today , but her campaign has insinuated in the past that @entity15 is also in the pocket of the high - ranking @entity15			1
' for @entity15 it has become a game of " you scratch my back and i ’ll scratch yours , " which is dangerous for @entity64 given that radical groups like @entity269 ’s @entity279 , the @entity280 and the @entity281 are bankrolling his candidacy , ' @entity69 's spokeswoman , @entity277 , said in a statement posted on the campaign 's website			1
' if elected to the @entity17 , @entity15 will continue to be beholden to these extreme groups – meaning continued support of cap - and - trade , higher taxes , @entity135 , and other job - killing legislation that will hurt @entity64 … just so he can please his out - of - state liberal backers , ' @entity277 accused			1
@entity15 brushed off the suggestion that he would be a rubber stamp for president @entity5 and majority leader @entity269 's agenda if elected to office when he spoke with @entity18 over the weekend			1
' all they [ @entity69 and her campaign ] have to do is look at how i have taken on the president on issue after issue , including the renewable fuel standard , ' he shot back			0
if anyone is being deceitful in this race , it 's @entity69 , he told reporters			1
a key facet of his message in the final days of the campaign , he said , will be : ' what 's @entity69 trying to hide ? ' ' she 's trying to hide that she 's not on your side if you 're in @entity16 on issues like raising the minimum wage , protecting and preserving @entity320 and @entity321 , making college affordable , making sure that employers are n't rewarded for outsourcing jobs , ' he claimed			1
' i stand with @entity64 , and i 've made that very clear in all of the editorial board meetings i 've gone to , in all of the interview i 've done , just like this , in our three debates , ' he said , taking a jab at @entity69 's refusal to sit down with the @entity334 until it apologizes for statements its made about the campaign that she believes are unsavory			1
' there are stark choices in this election , ' @entity15 concluded			0
' and that 's what we 're trying to get across to @entity64 as we travel through the state			2

' what 's more important , ' he told @entity18 , ' is that people have been coming to @entity16 to help to inspire ' @entity64 to vote
@entity15 , a four - term congressman , is competing against @entity16 state senator @entity69 for the @entity16 's open @entity17 seat
their race is one of a handful that will determine whether @entity75 gain control of the legislative branch next year
@entity69 has attracted positive attention with quirky pig ads that highlight her background in agriculture , the state 's most important industry
