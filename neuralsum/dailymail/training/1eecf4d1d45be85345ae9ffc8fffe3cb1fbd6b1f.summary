@entity0 weathered one storm but could not hold off another on friday as he charged to the top of the leaderboard at the @entity5			1
the @entity6 blew away overnight leader @entity7 with six birdies and only one dropped shot in 14 holes to take his tally to 13 - under - par for the tournament			1
but a huge thunder and lightning storm meant the early abandonment of play and forced tournament organisers to contemplate the possibility of a reduced format in the penultimate event of the @entity22 season			0
@entity0 tees off on the fifth hole at the @entity24 on his way to grabbing the lead with more storms expected on saturday , there is a race to conclude the second and third rounds in the space of a day , though on current form that is unlikely to disrupt @entity0			1
the 39 - year - old , who was five under for the day when he was called off , continues to thrive after the equipment change made in the wake of a disappointing @entity36			2
his mediocre @entity36 showing was the latest lowpoint in a year dominated by injuries and poor form , which saw him slide from 12th to 44th in the rankings – leaving him at risk of his lowest year - end ranking since september 2006			0
@entity36 star @entity44 was spotted with tissue stuffed up his nose to stem the flow of a nosebleed the enigmatic @entity49 made for an unusual sight as he was forced to play with the tissue up his nostril but having finished sixth in @entity53 last week , he has used a dusted - off old putter from two years ago to open up a three - shot lead over @entity56			1
his putting has been impressive this week , but his scorching form on the par fives has made the difference , with nine shots gained from the nine long holes he ’s played so far			0
@entity0 , who on thursday reflected on a ‘ * * * * ’ season in which ‘ there was no good ’ , said on friday : ‘ i ’m playing great and to be on the top of the leaderboard is always nice			1
it would have been nice to finish the round off but i guess it was n't meant to be			2
‘ the weather was perfect for a while until we got onto the 11th green and then things changed quite significantly			0
the wind switched 180 degrees and really started to blow 20 , 30 miles ‑ an ‑ hour			0
it was tricky for probably two holes and then obviously the storm come in pretty quick from there			0
@entity7 lost his place on top of the leaderboard to an in - form @entity0 ‘ i ’m playing well			1
it 's obviously a great feeling to be on the golf course when you 're playing like that , and making birdies is always fun			2
right now i 'm pretty happy			0
‘ saturday is just going to be a longer day , so rest up , get to bed nice and early , come out again			2
’ the slim chance of a player snatching the race to @entity95 crown from @entity96 appears all but gone			1
only @entity98 @entity97 , @entity99 or @entity44 – who had to stuff a tissue up his nose on friday to stop a persistent nosebleed - are still able to usurp the @entity103 but would need to win both here and in @entity95 next week while hoping @entity96 fails to finish in the top five in the season - ending event			1
however , none of that trio sits inside the top 55 here in @entity110			0
@entity99 ( left ) gives one shot his full power , while a plaque displays @entity114 's impeccable pose			0

@entity0 leads @entity5 after day two in @entity116
but second round is *incomplete* *due* to *thunderstorms*
@entity0 displaced @entity7 at top of leaderboard
@entity44 took unusual step of playing with tissue up his nose
race to @entity95 looks all but over with @entity96 's *challengers* *fading*
