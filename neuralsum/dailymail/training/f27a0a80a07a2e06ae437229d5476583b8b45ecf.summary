by @entity1 reporter here 's another reason to be thankful this holiday season - the cost of putting @entity4 dinner on the table is down slightly from last year			1
but do n't bank on those savings for any big @entity9 splurges			0
the average @entity4 dinner will cost $ 49.04 , or just 44 cents less this year than it did in 2012			1
and while every penny counts , if you need to do any traveling to belly up to the big meal , increases in airline and train tickets mean that 44 cents wo n't get you very far			1
the good news is that after some steep price hikes during the economic downturn about five years ago , food prices have remained mostly stable this year			0
poultry sum : though the @entity26 found the price for a 16 - pound turkey was down 47 cents on last year it 's a welcome change from 2011 , when the cost of @entity4 dinner jumped $ 5.73 , up from $ 43.47 in 2010 , according to the annual informal survey of consumer grocery prices performed by the @entity26			1
the group estimates the cost by averaging non-sale food prices around the country based on feeding 10 people a meal of turkey , bread stuffing , sweet potatoes , rolls with butter , peas , cranberries , carrots and celery , pumpkin pie with whipped cream , and coffee and milk			1
and yes , their estimates account for the need for those all - important leftovers			0
the credit for this year 's slight drop in price goes to stable commodity and fuel prices , both strong drivers of the prices consumers pay at the store , says @entity62 , a research economist with the @entity64 's @entity63			2
he says overall grocery prices are down about one - tenth of a percent since january			0
though the @entity26 did n't detect a price increase in turkey since last year ( they actually found the price for a 16 - pound bird down 47 cents ) , @entity62 says consumers should n't be surprised if that component of the meal jumps as much as 5 percent over last year			1
higher demand and feed prices are to blame			0
not so fun : the average domestic airfare is up 9.5 percent from last @entity4 to $ 313 , according to the @entity79 however , you might save a bit of cash on gas when you head to the grocer to get your turkey			1
at the moment , drivers are paying about 25 cents less per gallon than they were a year ago , with a national average of $ 3.19 , according to travel tracker @entity90			1
and while the group has n't issued a prediction for gas prices the week of @entity4 , they say that in recent years prices generally have dropped in the weeks leading up to the holiday			2
need another reason to drive ? the average domestic airfare is up 9.5 percent from last @entity4 to $ 313 , according to the @entity97 , which tracks tickets sold by online and by traditional travel agencies			1
meanwhile , @entity102 prices in september ( the most recent month for which data were available ) were up more than 4 percent over a year ago			2
consumers wo n't be able to do much about the cost of travel , but there 's always plenty of ways to spend less - and a lot more - on food			2
the @entity26 estimate budgets $ 2.18 for a dozen brown - and - serve dinner rolls			1
but if you 're willing break out a recipe and bake your own , a home cook could cut almost a dollar off that price			0
on the flip side , if you 'd prefer to leave the cooking to others and purchase a ready - to - eat meal from a grocer , expect to pay a premium for the convenience , maybe $ 75 or more			0
likewise , if your tastes lean to the organic or heirloom end of the food spectrum , you wo n't find turkey for $ 1.36 a pound as the @entity26 did			2
budgeting two or three times that is a safer bet			0
and since it 's impossible to escape holiday creep , we might as well break the bad news about your @entity139 roast			0
beef prices are at or near record highs this year , so you can expect to pay as much as 2.5 percent more than last year for that succulent rib roast you 've been waiting all year for .			0

research comes from a survey by the @entity26
the average @entity4 dinner will cost $ 49.04 , 44 cents less than last year
