they may not be the most glamourous of scientific instruments , but tampons could help experts clean up polluted rivers			1
engineers believe the super absorbent properties of tampons could be used to detect pipes that shunt sewage into streams instead of treatment plants			1
they found that the cotton products absorb chemicals commonly used on toilet paper , laundry detergents and shampoos , which glow under uv light , meaning that they could shed light on previously undetectable misplumbed pathways			1

here , a discharge pipe dumps raw sewage into a river it ’s estimated that around five per cent of homes in the @entity27 have pipes that are misconnected , causing them to leak sewage			0
professor @entity30 , who led the study at the @entity33 's @entity32 , explained : ‘ more than a million homes have their waste water incorrectly connected into the surface water network , which means their sewage is being discharged into a river , rather than going to a treatment plant			1
‘ unfortunately , it 's very difficult to detect where this is happening , as the discharge is intermittent , ca n't always be seen with the naked eye and existing tests are complex and expensive ’ but now his team have shown that tampons can glow in ultra-violet ( @entity50 ) light , because they absorb chemicals found in products containing ‘ optical brighteners ’ which are used to whiten and brighten colours			1
experts think tampons ( pictured left ) could be a cheap solution to detecting pollutants in rivers			1
on the right , professor @entity30 tests for sewage pollution in a stream in @entity64 , @entity27 , using a conductivity and temperature meter - a more expensive but less effective method than using tampons and uv lighting tampons absorb chemicals commonly used on toilet paper , laundry detergents ( pictured with a stock image ) and shampoos , which glow under uv light , meaning that they could shed light on previously undetectable mis - plumbed pathways engineers have shown that tampons can glow in ultra-violet ( @entity50 ) light , because they absorb chemicals found in products containing ‘ optical brighteners ’ which are used to whiten and brighten colours			1
optical brighteners are found in toilet paper , laundry detergents and shampoos			0
lab trials determined that just five seconds exposure in a solution containing 0.01ml of detergent per litre of water - over 300 times more dilute than would be expected in a surface water pipe – enabled a tampon to glow for 30 days			2
therefore , if a tampon is dunked in a river and glows under uv afterwards , experts can be sure there are pollutants in it			2
by using this technique at the opening of different pipes , they can trace the source of the sewage to certain households so that pipes dumping sewage into rivers can be redirected			2
when tampons are suspended in water contaminated by even very small amounts of detergents or sewage , they will pick up these ‘ optical brighteners ’ and glow			2
‘ the main difficulty with detecting sewage pollution by searching for optical brighteners is finding cotton that does not already contain these chemicals , ’ professor @entity30 said			2
‘ that 's why tampons , being explicitly untreated , provide such a neat solution			0
our new method may be unconventional - but it 's cheap and it works			0
’ lab trials determined that just five seconds exposure in a solution containing 0.01ml of detergent per litre of water - over 300 times more dilute than would be expected in a surface water pipe – enabled a tampon to glow for 30 days			2
the technique was then trialled in the field by suspending tampons for three days in sixteen surface water outlets running into streams and rivers in @entity64 and then testing the tampons under uv light			1
the scientists found that nine of the tampons glowed , confirming the presence of optical brighteners - and therefore sewage pollution			2
with the help of @entity149 , the team followed the pipe network back from four of the nine polluted outlets they 'd identified , dipping a tampon in at each manhole to see where the sewage was entering the system			0
this enabled them to successfully isolate the sections of each network where the sewage originated , narrowing down the households which would need to be inspected in more detail			0
a visual inspection in one area immediately revealed a house where both a sink and soil stack were connected to the wrong sewer , according to the results of the study , which were published in @entity149 and @entity171			0

this image shows a ' scum ' caused by detergent in the @entity182 when tampons are suspended in water contaminated by even very small amounts of detergents or sewage , they will pick up ‘ optical brighteners ’ and glow under uv light			1
here , fluorescent powders glow under uv light professor @entity30 said : ‘ often the only way to be sure a house is misconnected is through a dye test - putting dye down a sink or toilet and seeing where the coloured water appears in the sewer			1
’ ‘ it 's clearly impractical for water companies to do this for all the households they supply , but by working back from where pollution is identified and narrowing it down to a particular section of the network , the final step of identifying the source then becomes feasible			0
’ pollutants found in domestic waste water change the bacterial and invertebrate life in rivers , encouraging pollutant tolerant species and leading to the build - up of ' sewage fungus ' , which is visible as a grey lining to the river bed			0
waste water discharges can also carry pathogens such as norovirus			0
most misconnected households are unaware they are discharging their waste water into the wrong system and - once it has been identified - immediately rectify the problem			0
local authorities do have the power to complete the work and charge it back to the householder , but in practice , this power is rarely used			0
now that professor @entity30 has proved his method works in practice in the field , he hopes to trial it at a larger scale to identify all the sources of sewage pollution on the @entity245 , the river which runs through the city of @entity248 .			0

engineers at the @entity33 made the discovery
tampons glow under uv light when they have absorbed detergent
this enables experts to work out where pollution is coming from
*innovation* could stop sewage being *accidently* shunted into rivers
