all eyes will be on @entity1 as he bids for a dream end to his career but i have a strong feeling that a horse he could have ridden is going to come back to haunt him			1
the 19 - time champion jockey could have ridden cause of causes who , like his mount @entity12 , is owned by his boss @entity15			1
he has ridden him three times before			0
while it was ultimately no surprise he chose @entity19 , a runner with strong credentials , @entity22 also has very good reasons why he should be backed			1
cause of @entity11 at @entity24 last month he was second at the 2014 @entity24 and then landed the four - mile @entity25 at last month ’s meeting			0
that marks him down as a quality performer , and he is ridden by a @entity30 winning jockey in @entity31 ( @entity32 , 1999 ) and trained by a race - winning trainer in @entity35 ( @entity36 , 2007 )			1
his four mile @entity24 win indicates reserves of stamina for the four - and - a - half - mile , 30 - fence test which i like to see in my @entity30 hopes			2
@entity12 , the 2014 @entity42 winner , is also strong on that score			2
i like last year ’s runner - up @entity44 and 2014 @entity47 national winner @entity46 , as well as @entity48 , second in that race having won it in 2013			0
for those looking for an each - way punt at more speculative odds , @entity51 is a horse which has caught my eye			1
i will be cheering on my two sons			0
@entity57 rides @entity58 , another runner with a serious chance of a light weight , while @entity61 trains @entity62 , last year ’s seventh owned by a trio of rugby players including former @entity67 captain @entity66			0
he could easily nick a place .			0

@entity1 could have ridden @entity22 in the @entity30 on *saturday*
champion jockey ultimately chose @entity12 for *big* race at @entity73
@entity51 is worth an each - way punt at more speculative odds
