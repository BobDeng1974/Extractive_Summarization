by @entity0 published : 15:51 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 17:13 est , 13 november 2012 pervert : @entity1 , 55 , was arrested after putting a cameraphone into a bottle and videoing a 14 - year - old girl			1
he was banned from the internet but a judge overturned the decision ( file picture ) a perverted snooper who used a secret camera to video a 14 - year old girl in the shower and was banned from using the internet will now be allowed to go online after a judge ruled the ban ' unreasonable '			1
@entity1 , 55 , was arrested after the suspicious youngster spotted a flashing light in a shampoo bottle and found a mobile phone behind a hole			0
the police investigation found hundreds of sex images , featuring animals and children as young as four , stored on his computer			1
@entity1 , of @entity29 in @entity30 , was sentenced to a community order with three years supervision at @entity33 in june this year			2
he was also hit with a sexual offences prevention order ( @entity35 ) , banning him from owning a computer , using a camera in public , coming into contact with children at work and allowing the police to raid his home at any time			0
but after he complained that he was being cut off from the world , appeal court judges ruled it is ' unreasonable nowadays to ban anyone from accessing the internet in their home '			0
mr @entity53 and judge @entity54 , sitting at @entity52 â€™s @entity51 , overturned the strict @entity35 , replacing it with an order that he simply make his internet history available for viewing by the police			2
his lawyers argued that the order imposed by the @entity33 judge - which he said should last until the day @entity1 died - was unnecessary and disproportionate			1
police found hundreds of images on @entity1 's computer , some featuring animals and children as young as four ( file picture ) mr @entity53 told the court : ' the judge imposing the @entity35 said , " i anticipate that you will die subject to this order - that is my wish anyway			1
" they were not appropriate remarks to have made			0
' also criticising the ' lurid language ' used by the judge , he concluded that the @entity35 imposed on @entity1 was ' entirely excessive '			0
' nowadays it is entirely unreasonable to ban anybody from accessing the internet in their home , ' the appeal judge concluded			2
