by @entity0 published : 19:48 est , 13 november 2013 @entity2 : 19:49 est , 13 november 2013 just three cups of tea a day can slash the risk of a stroke by around 20 per cent , new research shows			1
scientists found @entity10 ’s favourite hot drink offers powerful protection against the deadly brain blood clots that kill around 200 people every day in the @entity10			1
the findings , by researchers at the @entity16 in @entity17 , back up research results published earlier this year that suggested four cups a day significantly reduced stroke risk			2
three cups of tea a day can cut the risk of a stroke by around 20 per cent , new research has shown strokes cost the @entity25 an estimated £ 2.3 billion a year to just treat and look after the 100,000 people annually struck down by the life - threatening condition			1
only cancer and heart disease kill more people			0
around 85 per cent of victims are affected by ischaemic strokes , where a clot travels to the brain and shuts off its blood supply			1
the rest are called haemorrhagic strokes , where a blood vessel bursts in the brain , causing potentially fatal bleeding			2
although many studies have highlighted the protective effects of tea on the brain , the evidence has still been inconclusive , with other research questioning whether it ’s tea that really prevents strokes			1
a team from @entity50 trawled through dozens of previous studies to carry out what ’s called a meta - analysis			0
this is where researchers combine the findings of lots of little studies to come up with more powerful data			0
in this case , they brought together the findings from five previous meta - analyses to see if tea really does have a significant impact on stroke risk			0
the results , published online in the @entity68 , showed those drinking the highest amount of tea a day - three cups or more - were 20 per cent less likely to fall ill than those drinking little or no tea			2
previous studies by the same @entity50 team found black tea was just as effective as green tea , as antioxidants in both appear to protect against the kind of damage to arteries that can cause strokes and heart attacks			0
@entity10 consumers get through an estimated 165 million cups every day of mostly black tea			1
it is packed with components called flavonoids that are thought to be good for the heart and brain.in a report on their findings the researchers said : ‘ the strength of this evidence supports the hypothesis that tea consumption might lower the risk of stroke			0

research shows tea offers protection against the deadly brain blood clots
around 200 people die every day in the @entity10 from strokes
