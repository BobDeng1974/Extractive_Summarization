young classicists – usually aged between 16 and 17 – were asked to read and offer a ‘ personal response ’ to an ancient but explicit account of sexual intercourse			1
the passage from @entity12 - one of @entity14 ’s collection of erotic poetry - describes in the racy embrace of two lovers			1
erotic : an erotic scene from @entity14 's @entity12 , as painted by @entity19 , caused controversy among academics after its inclusion in an as - level exam a version of the poem translates on passage as ' ... slip off your chemise without a blush and let him get his thigh well over yours			1
' and let him thrust his tongue as far as it will go into your coral mouth and let passion prompt you to all manner of pretty devices			0

' the addition of the passage , which was part of a longer section of verse from @entity14 's poems published in the 1st century @entity61 , in the exam for children provoked consternation from one leading academic			1
professor @entity65 , a reader in physics at @entity67 , @entity68 , and fellow at @entity70 and @entity71 , said the exam board was not in their ' right minds ' to include the passage for children as young as 16			1
he told the @entity77 : ' how would a school react to such material distributed on their premises ? ' many teachers would have glossed over this extract , assuming no one in their right minds would set it in an exam			2
' the text featured in an as - level @entity6 paper on tuesday set by the @entity68 @entity89 board			2
controversial : the inclusion of passages from explicit erotic poetry in as - level exams - typically sat by pupils aged 16 and 17 - has been criticised by a leading academic			1
( file picture ) students were awarded up to 10 marks out of a total of 100 on the paper for their @entity100 , professor of classics at @entity68 , defended the inclusion of the text , telling the @entity77 : ' please , let 's not go back to the days when kids were not supposed to read some poems of , say , @entity107 , because some old codger had thought they might get corrupted			1
' an @entity89 spokesman said not including the passages would be tantamount to ' censorship ' and would deny students the opportunity to study some of the finest elegiac poems ever written			2
the elegiac style is a poetic technique where each couplet usually makes sense on its own , while forming part of a larger work			0
the spokesman said : ' @entity123 poems are considered by professionals to be some of the finest examples of elegiac poetry that there are			2
' to censor such material would only leave young adults with a false perception of their area of study			0
if such censorship were to be applied to @entity136 literature it would preclude coverage of the works of @entity139 , @entity140 and even @entity141			0

students aged 16 to 17 were marked on their ' personal response ' to the erotic poems
