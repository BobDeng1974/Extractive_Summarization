a historic @entity1 launch that was set to take off today has been scrubbed due to bad weather			1
a historic @entity1 launch that was set to take off today has been scrubbed due to bad weather			1
liftoff of the 208ft ( 63 metre ) tall falcon 9 rocket was scheduled for 4:33pm edt / @entity6 from @entity7 in @entity8			1
but poor weather conditions meant the countdown was halted at the 2 1/2 - minute mark			2
@entity12 , founder of @entity1 , tweeted : ' launch postponed due to lightning from an approaching anvil cloud			1
' the company will now attempt to launch the uncrewed @entity18 rocket from @entity7 , in @entity8 , at 4:10 pm et tomorrow			1
but more bad weather is forecast			2
if the weather holds out , @entity1 is hoping to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform in the @entity22			1
the main aim of the flight is to deliver more than 4,300lb ( 1,950 kg ) of food , clothing , equipment and science experiments to the station , which flies about 260 miles ( 418 km ) above @entity30			2
on board the @entity31 is an experimental espresso machine intended for @entity34 astronaut @entity33 of @entity35			2
@entity1 is hoping to show that affordable , reusuable rockets are possible for future commercial missions			1
the plan is for the capsule to be released on a two - day journey to the @entity34			2
once this takes place , the rocket 's first stage will flip around and fire engines to steer its descent			2
it will then deploy landing legs to touch down on a customised barge stationed about 200 miles ( 322 km ) off the coast of @entity50 , @entity8			2
at a pre-launch press conference on sunday , @entity1 vice president @entity51 put the odds of a successful landing at 75 or 80 per cent			1
@entity55 this morning said : ' the weather remains the primary concern for today with the most recent report calling for a 60 per cent chance of acceptable conditions at launch time			1
' during a previous landing attempt in january , the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins , causing it to crash into the platform			2
a second attempt in february was called off because of high seas , but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart			0
the company will try again tuesday			0
but more bad weather is forecast the launch will be the easy part			1
after liftoff , @entity1 will attempt to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform in the @entity22 liftoff of the 208ft ( 63 metre ) tall falcon 9 rocket was scheduled for 4:33pm edt / @entity6 from @entity7 in @entity8			1
the company will make a second attempt on tuesday the @entity88 machine uses a normal @entity90 coffee capsule , which is posted in the top of the machine			0
water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated			0
the granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch , which is securely fastened to the machine using a ' rapid coupling / uncoupling system			0
' astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw			0
after demonstrating a successful ocean landing , @entity1 intends to bring its rockets back to a landing pad at the launch site so the boosters can be refurbished and reflown , slashing launch costs			1
' it 's a long - term goal , ' @entity51 said			0
as well as the espresso machine , the @entity31 supply ship also holds experiments for @entity55 's one - year space station resident @entity116 , who moved in a couple weeks ago			0
@entity119 cosmonaut @entity118 also will remain on board until march 2016			0
this will be the @entity124 - based @entity1 company 's seventh station supply run since 2012 , all from @entity7			1
a version of the coffee maker is scheduled for launch to the @entity34 aboard a supply capsule which will also include 4,000 pounds of food , science research and other equipment @entity12 - whose @entity124 company delivers supplies to the @entity34 and aims to haul astronauts as well in two years - wants to start retrieving and reusing his rockets to save time and money			1
first - stage boosters normally just slam into the @entity22 and sink			0
@entity12 recently unveiled the images of the @entity18 failed landing after persuasion on @entity141 by the game pioneer behind @entity143 , @entity144			0
the images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month 's attempt			2
after it fails to reduce its speed , the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding			0
@entity153 described the event simply as a ' rapid unscheduled disassembly '			0
@entity1 is one of two companies hired by @entity55 to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles			1
as well as a recently extended 15 - flight , $ 2 billion contract with @entity55 , @entity1 is working on a passenger version of the @entity31 and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit			1
the company also is working on a heavy - lift version of the @entity18 rocket , which uses 27 engines , compared to the nine currently flying			0
the @entity172 is expected to make its first test flight late this year			0
at @entity7 's @entity175 , a @entity18 rocket stands ready to boost a @entity31 on its fifth commercial resupply mission saturday 's mission was the group 's first to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea , which was held in position using deep - sea oil rigs			0
pictured is an image of the fuel and oxygen combining in an explosion once the coffee is brewed , it 's dispensed in a pouch , which astronauts drink straight from using a straw			0
