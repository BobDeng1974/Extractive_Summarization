gallstones patient @entity0 made a desperate 999 call for an ambulance - but his request was refused , an inquest heard			1
a 999 call handler advised a gallstones patient to call back if he fell unconscious as she refused to send him an ambulance - days before he died in agony , an inquest heard			1
@entity0 died just 30 minutes after he eventually arrived at hospital - three days after he first called for an ambulance from his home in @entity13 , @entity14			1
the 41 - year - old had been struck with the painful gallstones - which could have been cured with a routine operation			2
but despite his increasingly desperate pleas on march 29 last year , @entity20 , his requests for an ambulance were refused by a 999 call handler before his case was referred to an out - of - hours gp			1
an inquest in to his death heard harrowing recordings of mr @entity0 ' phone conversations with both the 999 call handler and the @entity24 urgent care unit			1
during a seven - and - a - half minute call , mr @entity0 begs the 999 operator three times to send an ambulance - but is refused each time			1
at one stage the dispatcher told him to call back if he fell unconscious or his condition deteriorated and advised him to take a warm bath			1
mr @entity0 can be heard asking whether he needs to go to hospital , before operator @entity41 says : ' no , you need to stay on the phone for a moment			2
' you could try a warm bath , hot water bottle in the painful area but if you collapse , become unconscious , unresponsive , faint , or become pale , cold or clammy it 's 999			1
' earlier in the conversation , she said : ' from what you 've told me you do n't require an emergency ambulance but we will get somebody to call you back			2
' mr @entity0 replied : ' ca n't i have an ambulance - i 'm in agony			1
' mr @entity59 received no medical treatment over the @entity61 weekend until his carer eventually found him in agony on the floor of his home on april 1 , and raised the alarm			0
on this occasion , an ambulance did attend and took mr @entity0 to @entity68 where he was diagnosed with pancreatitis			1
but minutes after he arrived mr @entity0 died			1
a post mortem revealed his gallstones had blocked his pancreatic duct and triggered a fatal heart attack			0
during the hearing at @entity81 a specialist from the @entity68 said that if he had been taken to hospital sooner he would probably have survived			0
consultant @entity83 criticised a series of computerised questions used by ambulance controllers to decide if callers need help and out - of - hours doctors who failed to ' ring alarm bells '			2
he said : ' six out of 10 people in intensive care with severe pain from this condition come through it - and it is nine out of 10 for those with less severe pain			0
' the algorithm failed to benefit @entity0			0
' it is biased towards heart problems and less towards abdominal pain			0
' paramedics eventually arrived at his home but mr @entity59 went into cardiac arrest			2
despite working to restart his heart throughout the six mile journey to hospital he was pronounced dead minutes after arriving			0
call handler @entity111 said the questions she was told to ask mr @entity0 by a computerised algorithm system ruled he did not need an emergency ambulance			1
she added : ' we can not override this and although there are paramedics in the control room for us to ask , i would not think the system would come up with the wrong answer			0
' after his first call mr @entity0 was advised to take a warm bath to ease the pain and the case was passed on to an out - of - hours @entity24 , the inquest heard			1
he waited 90 - minutes before dr @entity129 called him back , and told the medic he was in excruciating pain and about to pass out			2
but during the three - and - a - half minute conversation , the doctor refused to attend his home and instead told mr @entity0 - who lived alone and could not drive - to come to the surgery himself			1
mr @entity0 died shortly after being rushed to the @entity68 ( pictured ) the inquest heard a harrowing recording of mr @entity0 ' call to @entity139 which took place at 11.09pm on friday , march 29 last year			1
he starts off the call by asking for an ambulance before giving his address			0
mr @entity0 : ' my stomach 's in agony , duck , i 've got lumps in my stomach , i 'm in agony duck			2
' miss @entity41 : ' ok have you got any other symptoms			0
' mr @entity0 : ' no duck , just seating a lot			2
' miss @entity41 : ' how long has this been going on for ? ' mr @entity0 : ' mostly all day duck , a few hours			1
' miss @entity41 : ' ok , put your hand on your tummy or your chest and tell me if it feels a normal temperature			0
if it feels warm ? ' have you had any diarrhoea or vomiting ? ' mr @entity0 : ' yeah , i 've been sick a few times			1
' miss @entity41 : ' have you had diarrhoea ? ' mr @entity0 : ' no. ' miss @entity41 : ' have you brought up any blood ? ' mr @entity0 : ' no. i 've got gallstones in my stomach duck			1
' miss @entity41 : ' have you got any crushing or severe aching pain in your chest , upper back or upper abdomen ? ' mr @entity0 : ' no duck , i 've got just pain in my stomach			1
' miss @entity41 : ' is it below your belly button or above your belly button ? ' mr @entity0 : ' above			2
' miss @entity41 : ' have you got any crushing or severe aching pain in your uper abdomen ? ' mr @entity0 : ' sort of yeah			1
' miss @entity41 : ' what do you mean by sort of when you say " sort of " ? ' ( @entity184 ) miss @entity41 : ' is it a stabbing pain rather than a crushing or severe aching ? ' mr @entity0 : ' more like stabbing pain			2
can i have an ambulance ? ' miss @entity41 : ' have you passed a bowel motion that looks black and tarry or red or maroon			0
' mr @entity0 : ' no. ' miss @entity41 : ' and have you suddenly become confused or more confused than usual ? ' ( inaudible ) you 're going dizzy and that yeah ? mr @entity0 : ' yeah			2
' miss @entity41 : ' now @entity0 , from what you 've told me , you do n't require an emergency ambulance bit what we are going to do is we 're going to get somebody to call you back , ok ? ' mr @entity0 : ' can i have an ambulance ? ' miss @entity41 : ' from the answers you do n't need an ambulance ok ? ' mr @entity0 : ' i 'm in agony duck			1
' miss @entity41 : ' ok , i appreciate that , but from the answers you give me you do n't require an ambulance			0
what you do need to do is to speak to the local gp within the next two hours ok ? ' mr @entity0 : ' do i need to go to the hospital ? ' miss @entity41 : ' no , you need to stay on the phone for a moment ok			2
@entity214 can help with your tummy pain , follow the instructions on the pack , any doubt ask the pharmacist			0
do n't use ibuprofen or any anti-inflammatory such as aspirin as these can make your stomach worse			0
' stomach ache is very common , not often serious and gets better on its own , but you can try a warm bath , hot water bottle on the painful area - but if you collapse , become unconscious , unresponsive , faint or become pale , cold or clammy , it 's 999			1
' when mr @entity0 , who suffered mental and physical problems , failed to turn up for the appointment his records were marked ' did not attend ' and no further checks were made on his condition			1
the inquest heard the tragedy happened over the same weekend the @entity24 out - of - hours service was passed from @entity236 ( @entity236 ) to a new provider based in the north of @entity239			1
dr @entity129 told the hearing : ' i had no doubt he needed to be seen straight away but i thought it would be more effective for him to come in to the base			0
' i did not offer to visit because we had an enormous amount of work that night and it is better to examine patients in a clinical setting than people 's homes			0
' i did not call an ambulance because i knew he had already been told one was not necessary			0
' in hindsight when he said he was in pain i should have explored further what was causing it			0
' the inquest heard he was left in agony over the weekend and was not found until his carer @entity262 found him passed out on the floor of his home on the monday morning			0
mr @entity262 , from the @entity266 mental health charity , dialled 999 again and this time a response car and ambulance were sent			0
@entity270 medical director dr @entity269 said six of @entity272 's 11 services had the algorithm system which had been used on millions of people			0
he said : ' its conclusion to have the case assessed by a gp within two hours was correct and we trust that the other organisation will deal with it			0
' reserving his verdict until november 14 , coroner for @entity14 and @entity81 @entity283 said : ' he fell through gaps in the system because he was not pushy enough			0

@entity0 made desperate call for an ambulance on @entity20 last year
call handler told gallstones patient to take a warm bath and dial 999 again if he fell unconscious or his condition deteriorated
the case was then referred to an out - of - hours @entity24 , an inquest was told
carer found him in pain on @entity304 and called ambulance before he went into cardiac arrest
but mr @entity0 , 41 , died minutes after arriving at @entity68
