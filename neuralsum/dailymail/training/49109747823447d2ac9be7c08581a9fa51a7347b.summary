by @entity0 published : 20:13 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 20:13 est , 28 january 2013 she failed to place in her hurdling events during last summer ’s olympic games , but now , @entity5 has taken home gold			1
the 100 - meter @entity4 hurdler took home gold for her part in the @entity11 team , the first in her very short bobsledding career			1
the wunderkind debuted a disappointing performance at the @entity17 games , in spite of being named the favorite in the 100 - meter hurdles			1
the @entity11 edged @entity35 by 0.24 seconds even though the @entity35 won three of four disciplines on the @entity39 track			1
@entity42 added her first gold medal in her new sport to her two world titles in the indoor 60 - meter hurdles , in 2008 and ' 10			1
the winning @entity11 team included two - man bobsled pilot @entity60 , who earlier sunday lost his title in his main event to the youngest world champion in history			1
at 22 years , 270 days , @entity65 of @entity35 broke a record set in 1935 by @entity41 driver @entity67 , according to bobsled 's world governing body			1
@entity42 , a two - time @entity4 hurdler , was one of 24 athletes announced last october as members of this season 's @entity11 bobsled team , something that gives her the chance to vie for a spot on the @entity27 circuit this winter and , possibly , represent her country at the 2014 @entity82			1
giving it a push : @entity42 and her pilot partner placed second in the first round of trials different attire : the coach of the @entity11 national team has been recruiting track stars for years ' this is a breath of fresh air – cool , very cool , cold air , ' @entity42 said			2
it 's also what she said she desperately needed			0
it 's been a rocky few months for @entity42 , who was criticized by even some of her own track teammates at the @entity101 for the enormous attention she generates – and how that attention is n't always in line with accomplishment			0
she was the gold - medal favorite before hitting a hurdle and finishing seventh at @entity110 in 2008 , then managed only a fourth - place finish in @entity112 this summer			1
so in @entity114 , she 's tried to avoid the spotlight , even asking her new bobsled teammates if they 're comfortable having her around			0
the answer has been a resounding yes			0
' i did n't have a lot of time to get to know @entity5 through the media , ' @entity11 women 's bobsled coach @entity119 said			2
' these three weeks , i 've gotten to know her as an athlete			0
and she surprised me every day with how dedicated she is			0
olympic sprint gold medalist @entity127 – part of the world - record - setting 4x100 - meter relay team in @entity112 – also made the team as a push athlete			2
they 're the ones tasked with helping get the sled moving down the icy chute , then jumping into the back seat for the bumpy ride to the finish			0
the first time she went down the mountain , @entity42 was ready to quit – and remembers looking around for the ambulance , just in case			0
a few runs later , she was hooked			0
' definitely a thrill , ' @entity42 said			0
@entity127 , center , will be a push athlete , tasked with helping get the sled moving down the icy chute , then jumping into the back seat for the bumpy ride to the finish disappointments : @entity42 was favored to win medals in both the @entity155 in 2008 ( left ) and the @entity17 this year ( right ) but neither came to fruition			2

the much *buzzed* - about hurdler helped her @entity11 teammates secure gold at @entity160 , held in @entity40 , @entity41
failed to secure gold metal in 100m hurdles during @entity17 , despite being the favorite
