the asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs 66 million years ago also killed off many mammals , according to new research			1
although the extinction of the dinosaurs is thought to have paved the way for ' placental mammals ' such as humans , to dominate , the study shows that many other mammals died off alongside them			2
this puts a twist on the ' classic story ' that it was just the demise of the dinosaurs the allowed us to thrive - and instead suggests a mass extinction of mammals also played a part , too			1
a study led by @entity20 and @entity21 said two - thirds of our mammalian rivals went extinct with the dinosaurs ( asteroid impact illustrated )			1
so - called metatherian mammals thrived in the shadow of the dinosaurs			1
but many of them were wiped out by the asteroid impact the study was led by an international team of experts on mammal evolution and mass extinctions , and was published in the journal @entity37			1
metatherian mammals - the extinct relatives of living marsupials such as kangaroos - thrived in the shadow of the dinosaurs during the @entity44 period			1
but , the study shows that these once widespread mammals nearly followed the dinosaurs into oblivion			0
scientists have long believed that heavy dust from the asteroid impact blocked out the sun , setting off a disastrous chain of events that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs			2
but now researchers in the @entity58 have found evidence for a theory that major volcanic eruption began just before the impact , possibly also playing a role in the extinction			0
based on their analysis , the researchers determined that the eruption began 250,000 years before the asteroid strike and continued for 500,000 years after the giant impact			0
scientists at @entity70 and @entity71 calculated that the volcano spewed out a total of 932,000 square miles ( 2.4 million square kilometres ) of lava			0
the immense volcanism may have released dangerous levels of volatile chemicals into the air , poisoning the atmosphere and oceans , they say			0
when a 6.2 - mile ( 10km ) wide asteroid struck what is now @entity85 at the end of the @entity44 period and unleashed a global cataclysm of environmental destruction , some two - thirds of all metatherians living in @entity82 perished , according to the study			2
this includes more than 90 per cent of species living in the northern @entity93 of the @entity58 , the best area in the world for preserving the latest @entity44 mammal fossils			0
in the aftermath of the mass extinction , metatherians would never recover their previous diversity , which is why marsupial mammals are rare today and largely restricted to unusual environments in @entity102 and @entity103			0
taking advantage of the metatherian demise were the placental mammals : species that give live birth to well - developed young			2
they are ubiquitous around the globe today , and include everything from mice to men			0
the latest findings were made when the scientists made a more detailed evolutionary tree of mammals before and after the asteroid impact - and found many metatherians went extinct alongside the dinosaurs			1
this image shows a cast of the fossil remnants of @entity124 , one of the metatherian species that used to live on the planet millions of years ago			0
their mass extinction ultimately allowed placental mammals , from mice to man , to dominate @entity133 dr @entity134 , of @entity136 's @entity135 , said : ' the classic tale is that dinosaurs died out and mammals , which had been waiting in the wings for over 100 million years , then finally had their chance			1
but our study shows that many mammals came perilously close to extinction ' ( @entity146 shown ) study lead author dr @entity147 , of the @entity20 and @entity21 , told @entity148 : ' this is a new twist on a classic story			1
' it was n't only that dinosaurs died out , providing an opportunity for mammals to reign , but that many types of mammals , such as most metatherians , died out too - this allowed advanced placental mammals to rise to dominance			1
' dr @entity134 , of @entity136 's @entity135 , added : ' the classic tale is that dinosaurs died out and mammals , which had been waiting in the wings for over 100 million years , then finally had their chance			2
' but our study shows that many mammals came perilously close to extinction			0
' if a few lucky species did n't make it through , then mammals may have gone the way of the dinosaurs and we would n't be here			0

study led by @entity20 and @entity21 says two - thirds of our mammalian rivals went extinct with the dinosaurs
so - called metatherian mammals thrived in the shadow of the dinosaurs
but many of them were wiped out by the asteroid impact
this allowed placental *animals* - from mice to men - to rise to dominance
' this is a new twist on a classic story , ' said dr @entity147
