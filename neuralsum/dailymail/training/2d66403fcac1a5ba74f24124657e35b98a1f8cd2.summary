emergency services were called to the scene but left without clearing the mudslide as their heat - seeking equipment failed to detect any sign of movement			0
the busy a-road had been closed to traffic since the landslide and was not cleared because emergency services and the council said they were dealing with numerous flood alerts in the area			0

' mr @entity26 said : ‘ this was a tragic , freak accident			0
it was a chance in a million that they happened to be driving out of the end of the tunnel when the landslide swept through			2
‘ their car was severely crushed – like being caught up in an avalanche of mud			1
‘ it will be up to the pathologist to decide exactly what was the cause of death , but i would have thought it would have been pretty instantaneous			0

at that time it was n’t suspected that anyone was trapped			0

on the face of it it seems outrageous that somebody was in there for so long and that nobody looked			0
‘ the neighbours of the lady were concerned that they had n’t seen her around and the police broke into her place and found there was no one there			2
