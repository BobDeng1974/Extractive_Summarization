by @entity0 published : 06:57 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 15:52 est , 26 october 2012 the two @entity2 founders , @entity3 and @entity4 , were both aged around 13 when @entity5 was first released			1
so what better way to apply for a job at @entity2 than by making your very own version of every geek 's dream car - the cherished @entity13 which took @entity14 flying backwards and forwards in time ? 29 - year - old @entity18 , from @entity19 , really wants to work at @entity2 - and whether or not he succeeds , his hovercraft - take on the film legend will at least get the search engine 's attention			1
but @entity2 is renowned for liking the quirky types of tech enthusiast - as their own in - house job interview questions have shown - and they must admire the fan - boy dedication which went into producing the car			1
@entity5 was the seminal sci - fi franchise of the 1980s , combining a powerful time - travel concept with a cool car , classic guitar riffs , and a nostalgic look back to high school in the 1950s			2
with a young skate - boarding @entity61 at the helm , the film jumped from 1985 , to the 50s , to the dark distant future of 2015 , and then back to the @entity65 , all thanks to a @entity40 turbo - charged with a ' flux capacitor ' , or time machine to you and me			1
we 're going back ... @entity5 ! ! @entity14 ( @entity61 ) and dr @entity73 ( @entity74 ) test out the real deal high performance : the film @entity40 following its first spin through time and space - once it hits 88 miles and hour and 1.21 gigawatts the original @entity13 was the brainchild of controversial @entity82 businessman @entity13 who managed to secure £ 100 million of funding from the @entity84 to build the car outside @entity86 near @entity87			2
despite having an incredible design which included gullwing doors , the @entity13 was a spectacular failure as a car and a business			0
resurgence : @entity13 went bust but the car became one of the world 's most loved after the @entity98 starring @entity61 , pictured it was slow , unreliable and production ceased after just one year in when the company filed for bankruptcy in 1982			0
just 9,200 models left the factory with around 7,000 thought to remain in existance			0
but @entity107 set up the @entity108 in 1995 , 16 years after leaving the @entity109 in 1979			0
he also acquired the remaining tools , spare parts and distribution rights for the car along with the trademarked name @entity108 - cashing in on the name with deals with the likes of @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			0
he will also sell you a completely re-manufactured @entity40 using unused original parts from £ 37,000			0
a used @entity13 on the @entity109 market normally goes for between £ 15,000 to £ 30,000			0
@entity18 started his project in 2008 , and in 2010 turned to @entity125 , which funds creative projects , to raise the $ 5,000 needed to make the hover - car a reality ( minus the time travel mechanisms )			1
the ' car ' is actually a fibreglass construction , painted and sprayed to take on the classic @entity40 lines - gull - wing doors included			0
placed on an inflating base with an engine , the car can take to the waters around @entity137 - near to the @entity139 's stadium , offfering baseball fans a sprinkling of sci - fi to go with the weekly matches			2
the hover - car has previously featured on the @entity146 's @entity145 screens - after @entity18 took it for a ride during a match			1
he originally made the hovercraft as he ' just wanted to do something big ' on the run - up to leaving college , but what was expected to be a three - month project became a labour of love but if it can land him a job with the company that 's currently testing self - driving cars , it will be a job well done			1
under the skin : the fibreglass construction is lightweight , and sits on top of an inflated hovercraft base taking shape : the hovercraft , with its fan attachment , took more than two years until it was ready to travel through time ... or at least , take to the waters how it looks now : the labour of love led to an almost exact replica of the famous time - travelling car			2

@entity2 fan @entity18 builds back to the future hovercraft in *bid* to get a job with search engine
