by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity2 was accused of being a ‘ snake - oil salesman ’ last night after it emerged he asked the chief medical officer to review the medical effectiveness of homeopathy			1

the @entity14 has derided homeopathy as ‘ witchcraft ’ , and most scientists dismiss it as a placebo			1
@entity2 , pictured , has been accused of being a ' snake - oil salesman ' after it emerged he asked for a review into the medical effectiveness of homeopathy emails show mr @entity2 asked @entity9 to report on the studies , which were funded by @entity26 firm @entity25 , the world ’s largest manufacturer of homeopathic products			1
mr @entity2 has in the past spoken favourably about homeopathy , in which massively diluted ingredients are supposed to cure serious illnesses			2
but last night a source close to him denied he believed in the practice			0
‘ @entity2 is not a supporter of homeopathy and is not persuaded that there is any scientific evidence that it works , ’ he said			2
@entity9 said none of them were robust enough to provide strong evidence that homeopathy is effective			0
@entity44 said mr @entity2 should not have wasted @entity46 time and money on the issue			0
@entity49 , the party ’s health spokesman , said : ‘ put a snake - oil salesman in charge of the @entity46 and this is the inevitable result			1
’ ‘ as staff shortages affect patient care , @entity54 units continue to miss their targets and people struggle to see their gp , patients and medical professionals will be dismayed but not surprised to learn that one of @entity2 ’s first acts as health secretary was to waste time and money on investigating studies into homeopathy			1
‘ the government ’s own @entity70 website states that the evidence for homeopathy is ‘ scientifically implausible ’ but this does n’t appear to be enough for the error - prone health secretary			1
' as his policies continue to damage the @entity46 , i hope he has n’t ordered an investigation into the use of leeches			0
’ @entity49 , pictured , @entity44 's health spokesman , accused @entity2 of being a ' snake - oil salesman ' homeopathy claims to treat and prevent disease by using greatly diluted forms of herbs and minerals			1
it is based on the principle that ‘ like cures like ’ - that an illness can be treated by substances that produce similar symptoms			0
for example , homeopaths claim that onions , which make eyes itchy and tearful , can be used to relieve the symptoms of hay fever			0
but both the @entity14 and the commons science and technology committee say the @entity46 should stop funding homeopathic treatments because of a lack of evidence they work			0
the @entity14 has described homeopathy as ‘ witchcraft ’ , and last summer the @entity108 said homeopaths were putting people ’s lives at risk by discouraging them from seeking medical treatment			1
last month an @entity115 study concluded that homeopathy was no more effective than placebo			0
in a 2007 letter to a constituent , mr @entity2 said ‘ homeopathic care is enormously valued by thousands of people ’ and should continue to be available on @entity123 ’s health service			2
both the @entity14 and the commons science and technology committee say the @entity46 should stop funding homeopathic treatments because of a lack of evidence they work in the same year , he signed a @entity129 motion welcoming the ‘ positive contribution made to the health of the nation by the @entity46 homeopathic hospitals ’			2
and last year he held a private meeting with prince @entity135 , who urged him to ensure alternative medicines will be available on the @entity46			0
emails obtained by the @entity139 website show that in december , mr @entity2 asked @entity9 to review three studies on the medical benefits of homeopathy			1
in an email to a third party , the health secretary ’s office argued it was ‘ important we do not discount different methods of treatment if they prove to be effective ’ and said it would continue to pass on other studies regarding the medical benefits of homeopathy to the chief medical officer			1
the chief medical officer reviewed the three studies forwarded by @entity2 and concluded there were fundamental problems with their scientific method			2
according to emails , @entity9 found that it was ‘ difficult to draw useful conclusions ’ from two of the trials , though mr @entity2 ’s office noted that the analysis had found they were ‘ well - designed , with robust results ’			2
the chief medical officer also said the third trial , into the homeopathic treatment of patients with musculoskeletal disorders , had problems because it was not scientifically randomised and had a ‘ relatively low response rate ’			0
a @entity174 spokesperson said the department does not maintain an official position on homeopathy , and that decisions about use of alternative treatments should be made at a local level			0
‘ it is the responsibility of local @entity46 organisations to make decisions on the commissioning and funding of any healthcare treatments for @entity46 patients , such as homeopathy , ’ the spokesman said .			0
