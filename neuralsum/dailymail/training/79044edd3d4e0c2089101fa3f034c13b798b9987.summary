@entity0 : the @entity2 naturalist @entity1 , whose theory of evolution by natural selection revolutionised understanding of life it was an era of glorious scientific discovery			2
and the reason for the @entity12 unprecedented success is simple – they were ‘ substantially cleverer ’ than us			0
researchers compared reaction times - a reliable indicator of general intelligence – since the late 1800s to the present day and found our fleetness of mind is diminishing			0
they claim our slowing reflexes suggest we are less smart than our ancestors , with a loss of 1.23 iq points per decade or 14 iq points since @entity12			1
while an average man in 1889 had a reaction time of 183 milliseconds , this has slowed to 253ms in 2004			0
they found the same case with women , whose speed deteriorated from 188 to 261ms in the same period			0
the research team from @entity35 , @entity36 , the @entity37 and @entity38 said iq scores are excellent predictors of job performance and those with higher intelligence are both more productive and creative			1
but the scientists were unable to directly compare iq from different eras as earlier generations had limited access to education , improved nutrition and hygiene , which would have boosted modern results			1
instead , they compared reaction times , which they claim ‘ can be used to meaningfully compare historical and contemporary populations in terms of levels of general intelligence ’			0
the figures indicate a decline in brainpower since the @entity2 era , which contradicts the so - called @entity64 effect , which has found a worldwide increase in measured iq scores of three points a decade since the @entity68			1
researcher dr @entity72 said : ‘ they actually indicate a pronounced decline in iq since the @entity2 era , three times bigger than previous theoretical estimates would have us believe			1
’ @entity74 , left , the physicist who discovered the laws of electrolysis and electromagnetic induction			0
right , @entity78 , who invented the his analytic engine , the precursor to the modern computer , in 1837 the report in the journal @entity84 found : ‘ the victorian era was characterized by great accomplishments			0
as great accomplishment is generally a product of high intelligence , we tested the hypothesis that the @entity12 were actually cleverer than modern populations			0
‘ we used a robust elementary cognitive indicator of general intelligence , namely measures of simple reaction times			0
’ and with the research looking at historical reaction time data , the scientists claim the drop in modern iq could be even more dramatic than predicted			2
part of a differential calculating machine on which @entity78 worked for 37 years , only for it to be rejected for a patent by the government ‘ it should also be emphasized that whilst our value of a − 14.1 @entity45 point decline is an estimate based on the best meta - analytical data available , a simple inspection of our figure shows there is a non-negligible amount of scatter around the regression line			1
‘ the real magnitude of the effect might therefore be several iq points lower or even higher , ’ they wrote			1
‘ in conclusion however these findings do indicate that with respect to " genetic g " [ general intelligence ] the @entity12 were indeed substantially cleverer than modern populations			2
’ commenting on the study , dr @entity125 , honorary senior psychology lecturer at @entity126 and member of the @entity128 , said : ‘ this is a very intriguing paper , which seems to give the lie to the comforting notion that we have all been getting brighter for the last three or four generations			2
‘ reaction times are a real measure , with a reasonably large correlation with @entity45 , so this is an alarming finding and needs further investigation			1

study claims we have 14 iq points less than our 19th *century* ancestors
findings contradict the @entity64 effect , which claims @entity45 has risen three points every decade since the @entity68
