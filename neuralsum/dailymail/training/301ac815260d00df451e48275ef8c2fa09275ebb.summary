by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:46 est , 23 march 2013 updated : 19:47 est , 23 march 2013 a senior surgeon has been banned from operating at a children ’s heart unit facing closure after it was condemned for excessive death rates			1
the consultant surgeon at @entity9 last week agreed not to conduct any more procedures until concerns raised about ‘ aspects of his practice ’ were investigated			1
the hospital , already earmarked to lose its cardiac surgery department under an @entity18 review , last night refused to name the surgeon – one of only four in the cardiac department – and had released no public information about his agreement to cease surgery until contacted by @entity24			1
a spokesman said it had a ‘ duty as an employer ’ not to name the surgeon			1
crisis : @entity31 hospital is already earmarked to lose its cardiac surgery unit last year , the @entity33 said it had ‘ major concerns ’ about standards of care at @entity31 , claiming some babies had been sent home to die and called for an investigation following feedback from parents			1
the safety of children ’s heart surgery at @entity31 was also raised two years ago with the @entity46 health watchdog when a report found there had been 20 ‘ excess ’ or unexpected deaths over eight years to 2008			1
hospital bosses stressed the new concerns were not related to mortality or morbidity figures or the row over transferring patients			1
but they admitted the consultant was already under an earlier restriction from carrying out certain procedures			1
in a statement , @entity59 said : ‘ a surgeon in our paediatric cardiac team has agreed not to carry out operations until we have completed an assessment of aspects of his surgical practice			1
he has been subject to a specific restriction on his practice over a period of time and we review the position on a regular basis			1
‘ this professional review is being carried out within the trust			1
it is viewed as best practice and is part of running a safe service			2
’ @entity31 is one of three children ’s heart units to be closed after a review in the wake of the @entity85 heart scandal in the @entity86 in which 35 babies died and dozens more were left brain - damaged			2
it sparked a sea change in the way mortality rates in hospitals are monitored , especially in cardiac care			1
in recent months , a huge legal campaign , backed by publicity , has been mounted to keep heart surgery at @entity31 following last year ’s @entity99 review , which recommended all surgery be transferred to better - equipped @entity101			2
@entity31 is one of three children 's heart units to be closed after a review in the wake of the @entity85 heart scandal in the nineties in which 35 babies died and dozens more were left brain - damaged the campaign won the first round of a @entity110 judicial review , which found parts of the @entity18 consultation had been ‘ flawed ’			2
the @entity18 vowed to continue the closure plans , though another court hearing is due this week			2
last night there were calls for operations at @entity31 to be suspended to protect children from sub-standard surgery			2
one leading paediatric cardiologist said : ‘ we do n’t want another @entity85 where all those children lost their lives			2
there should be decisive action as there was when there similar problems at @entity128 in 2010			0
then they just stopped doing surgery and it never resumed			0
’ a senior expert on children ’s heart surgery last night said @entity134 ‘ ought to put the safety of children first ’			0
he said : ‘ when we were looking at the reorganisation of children ’s heart surgery nationally , @entity31 was bottom of the table			0
if there have been two incidents where surgeons have had stop performing certain operations , it would suggest there are serious issues that need addressing			1
' our number one priority has to be the children needing heart surgery			0
and they should be getting the best care possible , however far they have to travel to get it			0
’ the adviser , who worked for former health secretary @entity154 , said : ‘ we have been trying to reorganise children ’s heart surgery for four years and are still unable to implement our plans because of campaigns like the one in @entity31			0
based on the inspection reports of the various centres , @entity31 did not do very well			0
the case for keeping paediatric surgery at @entity31 is an emotional one			0
‘ one can understand support for a local centre , where some children have done well , but overall , looking at the interests of all patients , @entity31 does not meet the standard			0
‘ on clinical outcomes , they are misguided			0
what the campaigners have to think about is all results , not individual personal experiences			0
’ the reorganisation of paediatric heart surgery has been delayed for many years following publication of the @entity178 into the @entity180 scandal			0
although that report led to the raising of standards , the spread of services over 14 centres is thought to have resulted in children being at risk from surgeons inexperienced in certain types of surgery			1
sir @entity192 , @entity18 medical director , said five years ago it would be a ‘ stain on the profession ’ if paediatric heart surgery was n’t reorganised .			0

one of four consultant surgeons from @entity9 cardiac unit agreed not to conduct further procedures
@entity9 said it had a duty not to reveal the name of the surgeon
