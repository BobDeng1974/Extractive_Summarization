by @entity0 last updated at 10:22 am on 18th october 2011 an obese border collie fed on a diet of takeaways , chocolate and roast dinners has lost half of her weight in just six months after being put on a strict diet			1
@entity10 , who was limited to just two bowls of dry dog food per day , shrunk from nine stone two pounds to just 4.5 stone			1
the seven - year - old had been fed human food all her life when she was taken in by the @entity19 re-homing centre in @entity20 , @entity21			1
fat dog thin : @entity10 was limited to two bowls of dry dog food per day and shrunk from nine stone and two pounds , left , to 4.5 stone , right			2
now she is now much more agile and has a new lease of life portly pooch : @entity10 ballooned after gorging on roast dinners , takeaways , and fish and chips instead of healthy dog food she ended up weighing nine stone after being left to wolf down large dinners			1
but despite shedding 4.5 stone , @entity10 has to continue with her strict routine as she is still very overweight			0
border collies should not weigh more than three stone			0
when the chubby canine was first taken in by the trust two weeks after her elderly owner fell ill , it took three people to lift her			0
she was only able to walk for three minutes at a time when staff first put her on a tough exercise regime , @entity44 reported			0
pot dog : @entity10 weighed three times more than she should and had never eaten normal dog food before she was taken into care			1
now she has lost half her weight walkies is not fun : @entity10 is pictured with her canine carer @entity55 building up a sweat on the treadmill , left , and right , it needed two workers to lift her initially as she was unable to walk for longer than three minutes but now she goes for walks three times a day and works out on the treadmill as she sheds her puppy fat			1
previously she would be given a fish and chip supper on a friday and a full roast dinner on sundays			0
when she was first taken in , she had to have all of the fur on her body shaved off so staff could treat bed sores on her skin			0
she will be given a new owner - but will have to go back to the re-homing centre every two weeks to make sure her weight is not allowed to balloon again			0
big girl : @entity10 , right , weighed about 9 stone			0
a normal border collie should be no more than 3 stone , left carer @entity55 told @entity44 : ' she went on a hunger strike because she had never eaten dog food before , but eventually she relented and has made fantastic progress ever since			1
' @entity10 was left at risk of arthritis , heart disease and liver damage because she was overweight - the same problems faced by an obese human			2
when the border collie arrived at @entity88 , manager @entity86 said : ' unfortunately , when owners treat their pets as if they were humans and feed them the wrong food , they 're simply killing them with kindness			2

border collie was given *fry* - ups , takeaways and chocolate
@entity10 was unable to walk for more than three minutes - and was three times her healthy weight
