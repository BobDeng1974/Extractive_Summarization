by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 15:12 est , 21 december 2012 three @entity2 senators including @entity3 have attacked the makers of ' @entity5 ' , claiming its central claim that torture produced the breakthrough that led the @entity9 to @entity10 is ' grossly inaccurate and misleading			1
' @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity3 - all members of the @entity14 - sent a letter yesterday to the head of @entity17 , @entity18 , to register their complaint			1
they urged @entity18 to ' consider correcting the impression that the @entity9 's use of coercive interrogation techniques led to the operation against @entity10 ' and insisted that the waterboarding of @entity26 's no. 3 leader , @entity25 , did not provide information that led to the @entity10 's compound in @entity29			1
' we depicted a variety of controversial practices and intelligence methods that were used in the name of finding @entity10 , ' said @entity36 and @entity37 in a statement			1
' the film shows that no single method was necessarily responsible for solving the manhunt , nor can any single scene taken in isolation fairly capture the totality of efforts the film dramatizes			2
' in addition , the filmmakers credited the ' hard work and dedication ' of the intelligence community in finding and ultimately killing the mastermind of the 9/11 atrocity in which almost 3,000 people lost their lives			0
@entity14 chairman senator @entity11 ( left ) also added her name to the letter sent to the creators of the movie along with senator @entity12 but the senators said that after viewing the film they were left with the overall impression that torture of detainees led directly to the information on the courier who led @entity2 operatives to the bin laden compound in @entity29			1
' we are fans of many of your movies , and we understand the special role that movies play in our lives , but the fundamental problem is that people who see ' @entity5 ' will believe that the events it portrays are facts , ' the three senators wrote			1
' the film therefore has the potential to shape @entity2 public opinion in a disturbing and misleading manner			2
' ' regardless of what message the filmmakers intended to convey , the movie clearly implies that the @entity9 's coercive interrogation techniques were effective in eliciting important information related to a courier for @entity10			1
we have reviewed @entity9 records and know that this is incorrect , ' they wrote			0
' @entity5 is factually inaccurate , and we believe that you have an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for @entity10 is not based on the facts , but rather part of the film 's fictional narrative			1
' @entity10 hunt : a very different side of the agent was seen days after @entity10 's body was brought back			2
she even started crying last year , @entity3 asked then - cia director @entity121 for the facts , and he said the hunt for @entity10 did not begin with fresh information from @entity25			1
in fact , the name of @entity10 's courier , @entity125 , came from a detainee held in another country			2
@entity11 , who heads the @entity14 , backed up @entity3 's assessment that waterboarding of @entity25 did not produce the tip that led to @entity10			1
in their letter to @entity17 , the lawmakers said the " use of torture in the fight against terrorism did severe damage to @entity2 's values and standing that can not be justified or expunged			2
it remains a stain on our national conscience			0
we can not afford to go back to these dark times , and with the release of ' @entity5 , ' the filmmakers and your production studio are perpetuating the myth that torture is effective			1
you have a social and moral obligation to get the facts right			0
" director @entity36 and screenwriter @entity37 said in a statement from @entity17 that they depicted " a variety of controversial practices and intelligence methods that were used in the name of finding @entity10			2
" @entity36 and @entity37 , who won @entity42 for ' the @entity159 , ' said the new film showed that no single method was responsible in the successful manhunt for @entity10 , and no single scene in isolation captures the total effort the movie dramatizes			1
@entity3 said he watched the movie monday night after receiving a copy			1
' @entity5 ' is opening in @entity169 and @entity170 this week			2
it opens across the country next month			0
the eagerly antiicpated movie was produced in collaboration with @entity9 insiders and oscar winning director @entity36 enjoyed almost unprecedented access to security information about the hunt for @entity10 who was killed in @entity178 , @entity29 on may 2nd 2011			1
@entity9 insiders have confirmed claims by the film ’s director @entity36 that she is entirely justified in focusing on the role played by a junior female @entity9 analyst , named @entity185 in the film and played by @entity187			0
on target : the agent was one of the first to advance the theory that the key to finding @entity10 lay in @entity26 's courier network which led to his compound ( pictured is the attack scene in the movie ) @entity196 : the real - life agent who spearheaded the raid is reportedly furious that other agents - who she feels slowed down the progress of the search - were given awards for their work although the woman is still undercover and has never been identified , @entity5 ’s emphasis on @entity185 ’s importance tallies with the account of a @entity208 involved in the raid who later wrote about it in a book			1
star : many in the @entity9 are reportedly envious of how the female agent is getting so much credit for the assassination of @entity10 @entity216 writes in @entity216 of flying out to @entity217 before the raid with a @entity9 analyst he called ‘ @entity221 ’ who was ‘ wicked smart , kind of feisty ’ and liked to wear expensive high heels			1
she had devoted the best part of a decade to finding @entity10 and had become the @entity208 ’ go - to expert on intelligence matters about their target , he said			2
and while her colleagues were only 60 per cent sure their quarry was in the compound in @entity178 , she told the seal she was 100 per cent certain			0
‘ i ca n’t give her enough credit , i mean , she , in my opinion , she kind of teed up this whole thing , ’ @entity234 said later			0
the commando saw a very different side of her days later when they brought @entity10 ’s body back to their @entity217 hangar			2
having previously told @entity234 she did n’t want to see the body , ‘ @entity221 ’ stayed at the back of the crowd as they unzipped the terrorist ’s body bag			0
she ‘ looked pale and stressed ’ and started crying			0
‘ a couple of the @entity208 put their arms around her and walked her over to the edge of the group to look at the body , ’ wrote @entity234			0
‘ she did n’t say anything			0
with tears rolling down her cheeks , i could tell it was taking a while for @entity221 to process			0
she ’d spent half a decade tracking this man			0
and now there he was at her feet			0
’ although she remains active as a @entity9 analyst , it is believed @entity37 , @entity36 ’s screenwriter , was allowed to interview her at length			0
it has emerged that she is in her 30s and joined the @entity9 after leaving college and before the 9/11 attacks turned @entity2 security upside down .			0

three @entity276 including @entity3 slam @entity10 raid movie @entity5 as misleading for its depiction of torture as *instrumental* in *locating* the @entity26 chief
