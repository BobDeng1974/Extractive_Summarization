' the inquest heard yesterday how mrs @entity11 , who also had another son , suffered from malnutrition as she was unable to absorb nutrients			1
it was also heard that the surgeons who carried out the operation at @entity51 ( @entity51 ) may have got their measurements wrong when carrying out the procedure as it was possible a channel leading to the colon was cut too short			2
fatal operation : @entity11 died in hospital in @entity10 after she lost more than ten stones following a gastric band operation mrs @entity11 , who suffered from type two diabetes , asthma and high blood pressure , had undergone the procedure to help her lose weight on august 31 last year and seemed to be doing well and making the progress expected in the following months			1
however by december she was beginning to have problems keeping food down and was admitted to the @entity70 department at the @entity12 twice that month			0

he said on seeing her again at the hospital , her kidney function appeared to be completely normal and she appeared dehydrated , but not severely			0
her albumin levels , which indicate the amount of protein in the blood and could have pointed to malnutrition at the time , fluctuated but were also said to be normal			0

it was heard that mrs @entity11 , who was previously described as a ' very cheerful ' person by her gp , dr @entity120 , was also a ' stoic ' character who may not have let on to hospital staff just how ill she felt before she was discharged on february 28			0
mr @entity100 said : ' patients are very happy because of the weight loss so sometimes they tend to minimise their symptoms			0
' patients are more inclined to say ' it 's fine '			0
' the inquest heard mrs @entity11 , known as @entity128 , later contracted a blood stream infection , which may have contributed to her death of multiple organ failure .			1
