a woman is demanding compensation from a private plastic surgery clinic after a breast enlargement operation left her chest horribly disfigured			1
@entity5 was looking to make her breasts just slightly larger when she visited the clinic two years ago , and paid £ 3,300 for the implant procedure			1
but when the bandages were removed her breasts were left in such a terrible state that she returned to the clinic repeatedly for corrective follow - up operations , but each time the result was worse			1
@entity5 , pictured left before operation , spent £ 3,300 on the procedure which left her breasts , right , horribly disfigured miss @entity5 , from @entity15 in @entity16 , said : ' i wanted them to be a little bit larger and after reading the literature from the surgeon in @entity22 decided to spend £ 3,300 on the operation two years ago			1
' but afterwards when all the bandages were taken off i was shocked by the results and was asked to pay to go back for corrective surgery , but every time he operated they looked worse			1
' the young woman said that she was now so embarrassed by the way she looked that she could n't wear anything other than frumpy clothing to cover up her figure - and was too embarrassed to even go on the beach in a swimming costume			2
when asked for comment by local media , the surgeon - who has not been named because of privacy laws - said he did n't see why he needed to pay compensation , but admitted : ' her breasts do not look the best , i would n't be exactly thrilled if they were my wife 's			1
' @entity5 was left with uneven , misshapen breasts and nipples as well as huge scars , and is now too embarrassed to wear tight clothes or a swimming costume @entity5 is now hoping the courts will settle the matter , saying : ' i will fight for as long as it takes to expose this man as incompetent			1
' in the @entity51 , the average cost of breast implant surgery is between £ 4,000 and £ 5,000 , but patients must take into account that most implants need to be replaced every 10 to 15 years at further cost			2
an increasing number of women are opting for ' medical tourism ' , travelling abroad to undergo cosmetic procedures which are usually considerably cheaper			2
@entity60 , a consultant plastic surgeon and chair of @entity63 ’s clinical effectiveness committee , explains on the @entity65 website : taking your surgical needs abroad is not without risks ' if you 're considering cosmetic surgery abroad , do your research first			0
cosmetic surgery abroad often costs less than in the @entity51 , but make sure you weigh any potential savings against potential risks			0
both @entity74 ( the @entity75 ) and @entity63 ( the @entity76 ) have voiced concerns about patients having problems after cosmetic surgery procedures abroad			2
no surgery is risk free , and complications can arise after surgery in the @entity51 or abroad			0
if complications arise after an operation carried out in the @entity51 , it 's the surgeon ’s responsibility to provide follow - up treatment			1
it 's part of their duty of care to their patient			0
when patients seek cosmetic treatment abroad , aftercare is not always straightforward			0
some of the overseas clinics do n’t have someone in the @entity51 that you can turn to if problems arise			0
' how to be most prepared : beware of surgery and holiday packages which can often minimise the contact you have with the surgeon who will be carrying out your procedure establish what would happen if you were to have any problems with the treatment			0
what insurance arrangements does the clinic or doctor have , and will these cover you ? what will your own travel insurance cover ? ordinary travel or holiday insurance will not cover you if something goes wrong during or after planned treatment abroad			0

@entity5 spent £ 3,300 on operation in @entity16
had corrective follow - up procedures which made breasts worse
