one victim was four - year - old @entity69 who was bitten by a spider , and to the horror of her mother @entity72 , 28 , sent home from hospital without treatment			1
ms @entity69 took @entity69 to @entity76 , near their home in @entity79 , @entity80 , after the wound started to swell last week			2

‘ when i looked i discovered a lump of black in the middle with yellow around the outside about the size of a 5p piece , ’ the mother said			2
she said a spider bit her but because she is four and she ’s got a wild imagination i did n’t know whether to believe her			2
‘ i ’d read all about these spider bites and showed people on online forums pictures of the wound and they were sure it was a false widow bite			1
' a spokesman from @entity76 and @entity106 said staff did not know what had caused @entity69 ’s injury			0

traditionally they were only found in the south of @entity149 , but there are nests being found in @entity152 and @entity153			0
experts believe that the spiders my be thriving in the @entity5 because of a wet start to the summer followed by a heatwave			0
long - term climate change may also be to blame , leading spiders to set up home in new areas			0
however , some experts say many sightings of false widows could in fact be the common house spider			1
@entity118 , a 22 - year - old footballer from @entity119 also needed emergency surgery after a nasty bite from the spider			2

' poisonous : the false widow spider the spiders are distinctive for their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns			1
millions of false widows , @entity5 's most poisonous spider , are found across the @entity5 and the population is growing			1
also known as steatoda nobilis , it is frequently confused for the black widow , which has deadly venom			2
the false widow was first spotted in the @entity5 in @entity199 , @entity119 , in 1879			1
it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from @entity204 or the @entity205 in a shipment of bananas			0
the species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull			2
they have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size			0
the @entity215 says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the @entity5 , having been found mainly in southern @entity149			2
this theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them			0
how to avoid bites and what to do if you get one the key message is that you should n't disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened			2
to avoid it while asleep , remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs			0
do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight			2
if you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and can not see inside			0
also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing things			0
if you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction , pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention .			0
