a man who found a phone in a lake was amazed to discover it still worked - despite spending a quarter of a year submerged			2
@entity4 contacted the @entity6 page of @entity7 to tell them about how he found his @entity9 800 - lost three months ago - wedged between two rocks in the lake			1
intrigued , he took the phone , which was encrusted with mud , shells and other waste , back to his home and cleaned it up , took it apart and left it to dry on his radiator			1
tough : this @entity19 smartphone was found in a lake by @entity21 @entity4			1
despite three months in the water , it still works when he reassembled it he was stunned to discover it was able to make calls and even the camera still worked			2
the battery too had lost none of its potency , lasting two days from a full charge , reports the @entity33			1
what makes the discovery even more incredible is the phone is not designed to be any more water resistant than any other smartphone on the market			0
even phones marketed as water - resistant are only rated to survive under water for a maximum of 30 minutes , let alone more than three months			0
drowned : the @entity45 smartphone is not even designed to be water - resistant he posted : ' ( @entity47 ) took it home and started to clean as best i could , shells and muck on display , green goo around the entire phone and some other stuff			0
let it dry on a radiator and then i put in the charger cable			0
@entity7 was impressed with his story , posting : ' @entity61 ! really nice story , thanks for sharing it with us '			0
@entity19 user @entity66 was also impressed , writing : ' absolutely incredible , as most other phones break when you drop them from the coffee table height			0
' @entity19 has a legacy of making durable handsets , from the old 3315 to the new @entity9 range .			1

@entity4 lost the @entity9 but *chanced* upon it three weeks ago
he cleaned and dried it out , before *plugging* in the charger
the phone , camera and battery all still function perfectly
