by @entity0 a study has shown that as congressmen and women in the @entity4 voted @entity5 , the people in the states they represented drank more alcohol politicians voting liberal can cause people to drink more , a new study has suggested			1
researchers in the @entity4 found that as congressmen and women voted @entity5 , the people living in their states began to drink more - specifically beer and spirits			1
possible explanations include the fact that liberals are more likely to rebel through drinking , sex , and drugs , to the belief that public healthcare - such as @entity29 - and social systems are more likely to pick up the pieces if their drinking becomes a problem			2
economists behind the study examined all 50 states from 1952 to 2010 and found that the results agreed with previous research showing that socialists in @entity40 were more likely to drink than their more conservative counterparts			2
researchers estimate that if the congressional representatives for @entity44 - just over half of whom are @entity47 - became as liberal as @entity48 - where two thirds voted for @entity50 - the population could be expected to guzzle an extra two gallons of beer per year			1
dr @entity53 , a professor of economics at @entity55 , in @entity56 , added that the numbers were adjusted for economic , demographic and religious differences			0
a separate study of consumer habits by @entity61 found that liberals were 28 per cent more likely to drink both beer and wine compared with conservatives who favoured milk and fizzy drinks			0
another study published in @entity69 also showed that when both liberals and conservatives did drink , @entity47 were more likely to favour new , cheap brands of beer compared with conservatives who preferred pricier and more established names			0
despite his ale - swilling image , data suggests that right - wing voters in the @entity80 - such as @entity82 party leader @entity81 - are less likely to drink than their more liberal counterparts for @entity80 drinkers the same could be true , as 2013 data from the @entity86 showed that most problem drinking occurred in the @entity88 , traditionally a @entity90 stomping ground			1
men in the @entity92 were the heaviest drinkers , with 68 per cent regularly exceeding their daily limit , while those in @entity95 - where the @entity96 attract more votes - were less likely to over-indulge .			0

@entity4 researchers found that politicians voting liberal *increased* drinking
as congressmen and women *backed* the @entity47 , people in the states they represented started drinking more
same could be true for @entity80 where most problem drinking happens in traditional @entity90 *stronghold* of the @entity88
