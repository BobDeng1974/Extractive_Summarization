a twisted sadist has been jailed after he bred dogs to hunt down and kill foxes and badgers so he could film it for a sick thrill			0
@entity7 from @entity8 in @entity9 has been sentenced to 24 weeks behind bars after a photo showed him smiling with glee as he held a still live fox by the throat			2
the 45 - year - old , who captured the stomach - churning acts carried out by his dogs for posterity on video , admitted nine charges when he appeared at @entity22 upon @entity23 on friday			0
shocking : smiling at the camera sick @entity7 caught himself red - handed in this snap that has seen him jailed for using his dogs to hunt and kill foxes and badgers the court was told by the @entity29 ’s prosecution team that @entity7 was responsible for ' incredibly malicious and sadistic cruelty to animals			1
' in addition to his prison sentence of nearly six months @entity7 also received a lifetime ban on keeping all animals and the forfeiture of all his dogs and equipment used for baiting and hunting			1
the nine charges he admitted included causing animals to fight , keeping dogs for the purpose of animal fighting , causing unnecessary suffering and animal welfare offences			1
inspectors from the @entity29 ’s special operations unit spent two years investigating him			2
appalling : @entity7 , 45 , trained his hounds to hunt down and attack wild animals			1
he then filmed the sickening attacks on a digital video camera which he showed to his pals they were able to successfully bring the prosecution to court when forensic examination of badger baiting footage seized from a digital video camera proved a voice heard in the background was that of @entity7			2
the court saw graphic footage of @entity7 ’s black @entity63 terrier and bull lurcher type dog carrying out attacks on two badgers and a fox in separate incidents in 2010			2
in another clip a badger is seen having its leg torn off , while men - including @entity7 - can be heard laughing in the background			0
as well as the harrowing clips which showed the wild animals being attacked , the dogs used by @entity7 also suffered sickening injuries during the attacks			1
the defendant admitted that he would attempt to treat his dogs ’ injuries at home , rather than take them to a vet and raise suspicion			0
both the @entity63 terrier and bull lurcher seen in the footage were found at @entity7 ’ home when a warrant was carried out by police and the @entity29 in march last year			1
brutal : a badger is caught in the teeth of two of @entity7 ' dogs as he carries out one of his nighttime baiting sessions defenceless : the animal tries to escape but has no chance against the powerful jaws of the two hounds @entity101 : as one of the dogs continues to hold the badger 's neck , the second attacks the bottom half of his body and one of the animal 's legs is torn off the @entity113 had suffered huge injuries to its jaw and it was partially blind in one eye			1
four other dogs - also believed to have been bred for fighting and hunting - were seized during the warrant , along with paraphernalia , digging equipment and search lights			0
chief inspector @entity124 , from the @entity29 ’s special operations unit said : ' an enormous amount of time and effort was put into this investigation by our officers and prosecutions team			0
' however , it makes it all worthwhile when you see someone like @entity7 - who was responsible for such abhorrent levels of animal cruelty - admit the charges			1
' after all of my years working in animal welfare , i still find it shocking that someone would deliberately go into the countryside with their dogs , with the sole intention of inflicting unimaginable suffering on a wild animal for their own twisted pleasure			0
' it is even sadder knowing that , there are many others who are still doing this sort of thing in @entity156 and @entity157 to this very day			0
' make no mistake though , we will continue to track them down and the next knock on their door could be from us			0
