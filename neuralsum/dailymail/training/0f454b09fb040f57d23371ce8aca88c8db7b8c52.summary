by @entity0 @entity2 's first goal in @entity4 football gave @entity5 their first @entity7 victory of the season , beating rock - bottom @entity9 1 - 0 at the @entity10			1
the scoreline was hugely flattering to the @entity12 , who were on the back foot for virtually the whole game and offered very little going forward			0
but @entity5 could not take advantage of a number of carefully - crafted chances - and another inspired display from @entity20 - and were rather hanging on at the death			1
match - winner : @entity2 's first goal for @entity5 was enough to give them all three points against @entity9 the winning goal was a worthy one , @entity2 taking his time before finding the bottom corner with his left foot			1
@entity5 : @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity2 ( @entity34 71 ) @entity30 ( @entity35 78 ) , @entity20 ( @entity36 70 ) , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41			1
subs not used : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			0
booked : @entity37 , @entity30			0
@entity9 : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ( @entity51 45 ) , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 66 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 ) , @entity60			1
subs not used : @entity53 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64			0
booked : @entity54 , @entity49 , @entity56			0
goals : @entity2 35 referee : @entity67 att : 12,113 but @entity5 were nearly punished for their profligacy in the second half when @entity9 substitute @entity57 fluffed his lines with the goal gaping			1
@entity9 were nearly ahead inside two minutes , when a dangerous free - kick came in from the right and @entity52 headed wide from close range			2
@entity5 were quickly into their stride , though , and feeding @entity20 as much as possible down the right			2
@entity54 picked up an early yellow card for hauling down the young forward , and @entity5 nearly took the lead moments later			2
@entity40 's cross from the right found @entity2 , who headed over from a good position			1
an @entity30 cross then found skipper @entity38 , who volleyed over from 10 yards			0
the home side squandered a gilt - edged opportunity on the 20 - minute mark when @entity2 did extremely well down the right and crossed into the corridor of uncertainty			2
@entity5 would not have wanted the chance to fall to anyway but the in - form @entity20 , but this time he sliced his effort from eight yards well wide of the mark			2
@entity20 was lucky to escape in one piece when @entity49 went flying in on him on the near touchline and was perhaps fortunate to be given only a yellow card			0
but @entity5 were not to be denied and they took the lead 11 minutes before the break			2
another cross from the right caused all the damage , and @entity32 teed up @entity2 who found the bottom corner with his left foot			1
@entity2 was almost in again moments later but , after some clever footwork , his shot was blocked			0
@entity5 came close to doubling their advantage just before half - time , and again @entity20 was heavily involved			0
euphoria : @entity2 wheels away in delight after putting his side 1 - 0 up against @entity9 at the @entity10 @entity40 's cross from the right looked inch - perfect for @entity20 to tap in , only for @entity52 to somehow get in between his opponent and the goal to clear off the line			1
there was still time for @entity20 to fire inches past the far post , before @entity5 were given a huge warning on the stroke of half - time when @entity55 had a shot that was deflected just past the post			0
the second half started in much the same vein , with @entity20 causing all sorts of trouble down the right and @entity9 desperately trying to get to grips with him			0
he beat three men on one run before firing straight at the goalkeeper - before @entity9 almost levelled completely against the run of play			1
the cross from the left was inviting but substitute ranger poked over from inside the six - yard box			0
after being totally dominant for the entire game , @entity5 then dropped further and further back to protect what they had , which saw the visitors encouraged to think there might still be something in it for them			1
but @entity9 could not find the quality necessary to take advantage of @entity5 nerves and remain pointless in the table .			1

*summer* *recruit* @entity2 scored the only goal of the game at the @entity10
it was the @entity155 's first goal for his new club
@entity5 *recorded* their first league win of the season as a result
@entity9 remain rock bottom after four straight league defeats
