would @entity0 by any other name be as tasty atop your pasta ? a ripening trade battle might put that to the test			2
as part of trade talks , the @entity7 wants to ban the use of @entity12 names like @entity0 , feta and @entity14 on cheese made in the @entity16			1
the argument is that the @entity16 - made cheeses are shadows of the original @entity12 varieties and cut into sales and identity of the @entity12 cheeses			1
the @entity12 say @entity0 should only come from @entity24 , @entity25 , not those familiar green cylinders that @entity16 companies sell			1
feta should only be from @entity29 , even though feta is n't a place			2
the @entity7 argues it ‘ is so closely connected to @entity29 as to be identified as an inherently @entity33 product			1
’ by any other name ... : as part of free trade talks , the @entity7 is expected to propose to ban the @entity16 from using certain @entity12 cheese names if the cheese is made here so , a little ‘ hard - grated cheese ’ for your pasta ? it does n't have quite the same ring as @entity0			1
@entity16 dairy producers , cheesemakers and food companies are all fighting the idea , which they say would hurt the $ 4 billion domestic cheese industry and endlessly confuse consumers			0
‘ it 's really stunning that the @entity12 are trying to claw back products made popular in other countries , ’ says @entity50 , president of the @entity51 , which represents @entity16 dairy farmers			1
the @entity7 would not say exactly what it is proposing or even whether it will be discussed this week as a new round of talks on an @entity7 - @entity16 free trade agreement opens in @entity60			1
@entity62 spokesman @entity61 would only say that the question ‘ is an important issue for the @entity7			0
’ that 's clear from recent agreements with @entity67 and @entity68 , where certain cheese names were restricted unless the cheese came from @entity12			0
under the @entity67 agreement , for example , new feta products manufactured in @entity67 can only be marketed as feta - like or feta - style , and they ca n't use @entity33 letters or other symbols that evoke @entity29			1
it 's @entity33 to me : despite not being named for a specific place , the @entity7 included feta cheese on its list of products they 'd like renamed if produced in the @entity16 though they have not laid out a public proposal , the @entity7 is expected to make similar attempts to restrict marketing of @entity16 - made cheeses , possibly including @entity0 , @entity89 , @entity14 , feta , fontina , grana , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			1
and it may not be just cheese			0
other products could include bologna , @entity99 , @entity33 yogurt , @entity102 oranges and prosciutto , among other foods			1
the trade negotiations are important for the @entity7 as @entity12 has tried to protect its share of agricultural exports and pull itself out of recession			0
the ability to exclusively sell some of the continent 's most famous and traditional products would prevent others from cutting into those markets			0
concerned about the possible impact of changing the label on those popular foods , a bipartisan group of 55 senators wrote @entity16 trade representative @entity119 and agriculture secretary @entity120 this week asking them not to agree to any such proposals by the @entity7			1
led by @entity124 sen. @entity123 , @entity125 , and @entity127 sen. @entity126 , @entity128 , the members wrote that in the states they represent , ‘ many small - or medium - sized , family owned businesses could have their businesses unfairly restricted ’ and that export businesses could be gravely hurt			0
@entity123 said artisanal cheese production is a growing industry across @entity124			0
‘ @entity93 is @entity93 , no matter how you slice it , ’ he said			0
@entity137 , a spokesman for the @entity16 trade representative , said conversations on the issue are in the early stages but that the @entity16 and @entity7 have ‘ different points of view ’ on the topic			1
the agency would n't disclose details of the negotiations , but @entity137 said the @entity16 government is ‘ committed to increasing opportunity for @entity16 businesses , farmers and workers through trade			2
’ large food companies that mass - produce the cheeses are also fighting the idea			0
@entity157 , closely identified with its grated parmesan cheese , says the cheese names have long been considered generic in the @entity16			2
‘ such restrictions could not only be costly to food makers , but also potentially confusing for consumers if the labels of their favorite products using these generic names were required to change , ’ says @entity157 spokesman @entity161			0
feeling bleu : @entity14 was also among the cheeses whose names the @entity7 covets some producers say they are incensed because it was @entity12 who originally brought the cheeses here , and the @entity16 companies have made them more popular and profitable in a huge market			1
@entity177 , president of the @entity179 , @entity180 , company @entity178 , produced cheese with his family in @entity25 until he brought his trade to the @entity16 in 1979			2
‘ we have invested years and years making these cheeses , ’ @entity177 says			0
‘ you can not stop the spreading of culture , especially in the global economy			0
’ he says that companies who make certain cheeses would have to come together and figure out new names for them , which would be almost impossible to do			0
his suggestion for @entity0 ? ‘ i ca n't believe it 's not @entity0 , ’ he jokes			2
@entity197 works for the @entity16 @entity198 and is the director of a group formed to fight the @entity7 changes , the @entity202			1
he says the idea that only great cheese can come from @entity12 ‘ is just not the case anymore			0
’ he points out that artisanal and locally produced foods are more popular than ever here and says some consumers may actually prefer the @entity16 brands			2
@entity12 producers can still lay claim to more place - specific names , like @entity0 , he says			1
‘ this is about rural @entity68 and jobs , ’ he said .			0

the @entity7 says @entity16 - made feta , *gorgonzola* , @entity0 and other products are n't fit to be called by their traditional names
similar demands could also be made over @entity16 - produced bologna , @entity99 , @entity33 yogurt , @entity102 oranges and prosciutto
