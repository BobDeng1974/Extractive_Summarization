a woman who spent 30 years of her life believing that she suffered from cerebral palsy , only to learn that she had in fact been misdiagnosed and almost all of her symptoms could be cured with just one pill , insists she feels no resentment or anger about her doctor ’s life - changing error			1
@entity11 , 38 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , was told she had spastic diplegia , a form of cerebral palsy , when she was just four - years - old , she explained to @entity16			1
but after three decades of suffering from muscle spasms , weakness , near immobility , as well as undergoing painful surgical procedures , she learned at the age of 33 that she actually had dopa - responsive dystonia ( @entity23 ) , a rare , yet treatable , muscle disorder			1
' honestly , i ’ve never had any negative thoughts about what i went through , ' @entity11 told @entity28 of her misdiagnosis , which saw her confined to a bed for much of her childhood			1
the 38 - year - old has now discovered she was misdiagnosed with spastic diplegia , a form of cerebral palsy different life : @entity11 , who is pictured with her husband ( @entity40 ) and by herself ( r ) , used a mobility scooter before she was diagnosed as having dopa - responsive dystonia ( @entity23 ) , a rare , yet treatable , muscle disorder while @entity11 admitted that there ' plenty of times ' she wished she did n't have to deal with the physical symptoms associated with condition , including her dependence on others to complete everyday tasks , she noted that she still had a ' fantastic childhood ' - thanks in large part to the unwavering support of her family and friends			1
' even though i had challenges , my parents were so good with dealing with my disability and did n’t “ baby ” me , ' she explained			0
' also , i had true friendships that i never had to question			0
all of my life experiences made me who i am today - and i like me			2
' when @entity11 was first diagnosed with spastic diplegia , she was considered a textbook case , even though her mris and cat scans did n’t show any typical symptoms of the disorder			1
and because her neurologist was considered one of the best in the field , second opinions never yielded any other conclusions			0
' i had been seen by one of the best in the country , if not the world , and my parents even took me to the leading hospital in the @entity82 for a second opinion , ' she recalled			0
' they confirmed the spastic diplegia diagnosis and said that my doctor taught all of them			1
' @entity11 said she never questioned her original diagnosis and instead chose to accept her physical struggles and focus on living her life to the best of her ability			2
' i was never one to dwell on my disability or to think about it too much , other than when i was at these doctor appointments , ' she said			0
' i guess i was too busy trying to live a normal life and having fun with my friends and family			0
' by the time she was 12 - years - old , @entity11 underwent a ' very painful ' muscle transfer to prevent her knees from knocking together when she walked			1
miracle drug : @entity11 , who was once nearly immobile , completed a 10 - mile hike with her husband ( pictured ) four months after she started taking her @entity23 medication known as l - @entity108 happy family : @entity11 is pictured with her husband and their three children following her correct diagnosis of @entity23 although she compared the physical agony to open heart surgery , she said she was glad her parents encouraged her to have the procedure , which helped her a great deal and helped to prevent her from tripping over herself when she walked			1
@entity11 , who said she ' still ca n't get her knees to touch ' , noted that she was ' happy that it was a permanent procedure ' , although she would have done it again if needed			2
when she was in her late twenties , the mother - of - three had a pump implanted in her body to distribute medicine , but when she ended up over-medicated she visited a specialist who would eventually change her life forever			1
@entity11 's new doctor questioned her original diagnosis and sent her to another neurologist			2
her new neurologist told her she had actually been living with @entity23 , noting that most of her symptoms would improve or disappear with a daily dose of a medication known as @entity108			1
the neurologist explained that the symptoms of @entity23 , including the involuntary muscle contractions and tremors , are often mistaken for cerebral palsy or other disorders			1
but @entity11 ' could n't imagine having anything other than spastic diplegia ' and confessed that she was n't even going to fill the prescription until her husband persuaded to her to try it			1
' when i began taking it , i was the biggest skeptic , ' she said			0
' i was expecting no results whatsoever and could n’t imagine a life any other way			0
' @entity11 was given what she now knows to be her correct diagnosis on @entity154 in 2010 and just two days later , on @entity155 , she stood for the first time without assistance			2
new world : @entity11 can be seen using trekking poles during one of her hikes true love : the happy couple posed for a photo when @entity11 still believed she had spastic diplegia it soon became clear that the medication was working better than @entity11 could have ever imagined			1
as she got stronger , her husband began working with her to increase her walking distance and fourth months later , they celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary by traveling the 1,200 mile road around @entity172 - the location of their first honeymoon			2
and not only was @entity11 able to walk to the touristy locations that she previously had to be carried to , she was actually able to complete a 10 - mile hike along with her husband			1
while @entity11 said that they took their time and had snacks along the way , she was amazed by her physical accomplishment			0
' i was so proud of myself and thought that there are so many people in the world that physically can do stuff like this but choose not to , ' she said			0
' and i began to think of all the places i would love to travel with my family that would n’t have been an option before			0
' and while @entity11 realized that there are so many things she wants to try now that she can , she still insists that she does n't have any regrets about receiving her diagnosis so late in life			1
as someone who believes that everything happens for a reason , she noted that if she had n’t been diagnosed with cerebral palsy , she probably would have chosen a different college , meaning she never would have met her husband and had three children with him			2
' all i know is , i ’ve never been one to live with regrets and i was n’t about to start that thought process as the result of a new diagnosis , ' @entity11 explained			0
' @entity209 , i can do things that i never would have even considered before , so i have no reason to be angry or upset			0
i ’m just so darn happy ! ' night out : @entity11 was wearing heels six months after she started taking @entity108 to relieve her muscle spasms and tremors i began to think of all the places i would love to travel with my family that would n’t have been an option before although @entity108 has drastically changed her life , @entity11 still has to make sure that she gets plenty of sleep and remains as stress free as possible , or she can suffer from incredibly sore muscles and cramps , as well as issues with balance and tremors in her hands			1
' i work really hard to make sure i get the rest i need and not put too much pressure on myself			0
and i exercise every day , ' she said			0
' but it ’s still way better than the alternative			0
' she added : ' i ’m so lucky to have this “ miracle drug ”			0
it has not only changed my life but the lives of my husband and kids			0
' five years after her proper diagnosis , @entity11 has become an advocate for raising awareness for @entity23 , which is often misdiagnosed			1
and eight months ago , she decided to wean herself off of @entity108 for a week so she could film herself walking , both on and off her medication , in order to help others recognize the symptoms of @entity23			1
@entity11 posted the video to @entity248 in september 2014 and has since received emails from people who said her video helped them recognize @entity23 in either themselves or their loved ones			2
she is also blogging about her journey on her website			0
' i feel that my story is so important because i ’m sure there must be others out there who too are misdiagnosed with [ cerebral palsy ] , ' she said			2
' if this story helps just one person i will be thrilled			0
