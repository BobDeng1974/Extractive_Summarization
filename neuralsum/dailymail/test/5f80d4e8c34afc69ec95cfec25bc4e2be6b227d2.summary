break - ups can be hard enough to deal with but two women were left with permanent reminders of their failed relationships thanks to having their ex-partners ' names tattooed on their bodies			1
@entity7 , 23 , from @entity8 , was so desperate to remove her former flame 's name from her forearm when she met her new man , @entity12 , she tried to burn it off with acid			1
' i 'm desperate to get rid of it , i have bad dreams about it , ' she said on @entity20 show tattoo disasters			1
' i came across a @entity31 video about acid peels so i thought that would be the way to get rid of my tattoo			2
the kit cost Â£ 25 online and i thought " bargain "			2
' but instead of removing her tattoo as she hoped , @entity7 's dangerous @entity38 treatment gave her chemical burns			1
a chemical peel should be applied by a beauty professional as it 's designed to damage the skin in a controlled way			1
the body responds to the damage by healing and rejuvenating the skin - supposedly making it look younger			1
but @entity7 applied the acid without diluting it with water or reading the instructions			1
as a result , it immediately caused her skin to burn and blister			1
@entity7 's tattoo , left , featuring the name of her ex , and the burns she suffered , right , after applying acid six painful applications left @entity7 's skin red raw and scabby - and the tattoo remained she said : ' it felt like someone had poured boiling water on my arm and then got a lighter to it			1
' after five minutes it went white and blistered , then started peeling , after three days it went all scabby			0
' i did n't want to get it checked in case the nurses thought i was self - harming and i did n't want them to take the acid off me as i still wanted it			1
' despite her painful first encounter with the acid , @entity7 repeated the treatment another six times			1
her skin became red raw , scabby and inflamed - and worst of all , the tattoo was still visible			1
realising her diy treatments were a painful failure , @entity7 finally sought the advice of tattoo artist @entity87			1
he said : ' i have never seen anything like it before , my first reaction was shock , she should n't have taken such a drastic measure to use acid on her skin			1
' @entity95 , left , regretted getting her ex-boyfriend 's name tattooed on her bikini line , right he recommended laser removal surgery but said @entity7 would have to wait until her skin has healed from the acid burns			1
@entity7 said : ' i regret doing the acid now as i have made process slower			1
it will be another six to nine months till it will be completely gone			0
' another woman keen to get rid of a tattoo featuring the name of an ex is @entity95 , 23 , a dental nurse , from @entity108			1
she appears on @entity109 show @entity110 this week where she reveals her regrets over her tattoo			1
' my boyfriend @entity113 and i got matching tattoos			0
then we broke up and i 'm left with his name tattooed on me in an awkward position below my bikini line			2
' i regret it every single day			0
it upsets me and i 'm constantly reminds me of what happened when i look at it			0
i definitely should n't have done it , it was a really big mistake , ' she said			2
@entity95 said the tattoo had seemed like a good idea at the time but now she 's been dumped by @entity113 , it 's a permanent reminder of the love she 's lost			1
@entity95 realised the tattoo was a big mistake when @entity113 dumped her the dental nurse managed to get the old tattoo covered up with a new one by tattoo artist @entity138 before , left , and after , right , shots reveal how @entity95 no longer has @entity113 's name visible on her body ' i was in love with him and i thought he was in love with me			1
we got matching tattoos as we thought we could be together forever , ' she said			0
' a year - and - a - half later he decided he wanted to be single when he went to uni and broke up with me			0
when he broke up with me , i said " i have your name tattooed on me , what am i going to do ? " ' @entity95 sought the advice of skin expert dr @entity155 who told her : ' you have two options - one is to get rid of it altogether and that would involve using laser , which is quite a long , painstaking process and will cause some discomfort			2
' the other is to change it so the word @entity113 is n't distinguishable			0
' @entity95 decided on the latter and enlisted the help of tattoo artist @entity138 , who is no stranger to ridding people of tattoos featuring the name of an ex. he said : ' i like it when people come to me with a tattoo they hate and i can transform it into one they love			0
' when i first saw @entity95 ' tattoo , i thought , " @entity177 that 's a bad mistake "			2
the " @entity113 " is quite substantial			0
' names are a common cover - up			0
in the tattoo world it 's believed to be a jinx , if you put someone 's name on your body , it will end up bad			2
' @entity138 designed a feminine paisley style tattoo to cover up the name and @entity95 was delighted with the end result			0
she said : ' i love it , it looks amazing , @entity113 is no more , you ca n't see the old tattoo at all			2
i feel like a weight is off my shoulders , it has a closed a chapter for me , now i can finally move on			0
' now i can look down and see a nice tattoo instead of bad memories			0
