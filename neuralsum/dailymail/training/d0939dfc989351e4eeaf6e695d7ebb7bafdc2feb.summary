by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:36 est , 27 february 2014 @entity3 : 12:28 est , 27 february 2014 the families of the soldiers killed in the 1982 @entity8 @entity7 bomb have been accused of ‘ bitterness ’ and failing to move on , by the @entity11 minister who agreed to the scheme which saw a suspect walk free from court			1
former @entity16 secretary @entity15 refused to apologise for the deals which critics say amounted to an ‘ amnesty ’ for nearly 200 suspected @entity7 killers			1
he said that while the feelings of the relatives of the bombing victims were ‘ understandable ’ , the @entity22 government had to help ‘ society as a whole to move on ’			2
convicted @entity7 member @entity28 , 62 , of @entity29 , walked free from court after being given a letter by the @entity33 government telling him he was not wanted by police in a deal agree by then @entity16 secretary @entity15 ( right ) fresh talks are being held today between government ministers and the devolved assembly , after first minister @entity40 threatened to resign after being left in the dark about blunders by police and prosecutors which saw one of the alleged bombers @entity28 walk free from court			1
convicted @entity7 terrorist @entity28 , 62 , was arrested last year and was due to stand trial for the july 1982 nail bomb atrocity which killed four @entity51 soldiers and seven horses and injured 31 people			1
he was told this week that he would not face prosecution because of a letter – dubbed a ‘ get - out - of - jail - free card ’ – mistakenly sent to him saying he was not wanted by police			1
the letter was sent in july 2007 , when @entity33 was prime minister , assuring him he was not wanted for any offence despite a warrant for his arrest existing since may 29 , 1983			1
a judge will be appointed to investigate the operation of a @entity64 scheme to deal with on - the - run republicans , @entity60 has announced			2
the prime minister said he accepted calls for a ' full , independent examination ' of the process after @entity70 ( @entity70 ) first minister @entity40 threatened to @entity71 said : ' the case has already been referred to the @entity73 but , as the first minister has said , we should have a full , independent examination of the whole operation of this scheme			2
' so i can announce today that we will appoint an independent judge to produce a full public account of the operation of this administrative scheme to determine whether any other letters were sent in error			2
' the judge will be given ' full access to government files and officials ' and will report by the end may , mr @entity60 said , with the findings being published			2
the letters scheme was set up in 2005 after public outcry forced mr @entity15 , then @entity92 , to drop legislation that would have written the amnesties into law			1
he has now refused to apologise , saying the deals were necessary to secure peace			1
‘ it was a necessary part of getting to the position where @entity16 escaped from its hideous past of evil and terrorism to almost universal peace and stability			2
i make no apology for that			0
’ however , writing for the @entity107 he repeatedly suggested that the need to reach a deal over-ruled the feelings of the victims ’ families			0
mr @entity15 said : ‘ the bitterness of families and friends of the four soldiers killed in the 1982 @entity8 terrorist atrocity over the @entity28 debacle is understandable , ’ he said			1
‘ after being officially cleared as a suspect , he was prosecuted in circumstances i still find astonishing ; then yesterday that prosecution was aborted			1
no wonder there is anger on all sides			0
’ he insisted that @entity16 today is ‘ light years from where it was ’ , the result of ‘ determined leadership by @entity33 and his ministers ’			0
he said the widows of prison officers killed in the @entity134 would always view the endgame as ‘ betrayal ’			0
mr @entity15 added : ‘ they did n't and still do n't accept the abnormal measures that were necessary to normalise @entity16 , just as bringing closure to other bitter conflicts around the world has required governments to do controversial and difficult things			0
‘ although nobody should presume to ask victims to draw a line under the past , there are times when the government must take a view on the best way for society as a whole to move on , to get closure on the past , difficult as that is			0
’ explosion : a detachment of the @entity156 's @entity51 lay dead , victims of a concealed car bomb detonated in @entity159 's @entity8 two of the four victims : the families of @entity51 soldiers @entity163 ( left ) and @entity164 ( right ) said they ' never ceased in their desire to see that justice be done ' deaths : @entity169 ( left ) and @entity170 ( right ) , the other two soldiers killed in the bombing in 1982 families of the victims of the @entity8 bombing said they felt ‘ devastatingly let down ’ by ‘ catastrophic failures ’ which led to @entity28 's release and called for a review of the ‘ comfort letters ’ issued to @entity7 suspects			1
in a statement , the relatives of corporal @entity164 , 36 , lieutenant @entity181 , 23 , trooper @entity169 and lance corporal @entity170 , both 19 , who were slain when a bomb packed with 30lbs of nails exploded as the @entity184 and @entity185 rode to the @entity187 ceremony , said : ‘ this news has left us all feeling devastatingly let down , even more so when the monumental blunder behind this judgment lies at the feet of the @entity193			1
@entity16 @entity40 threatened to resign if the @entity195 government refuses to order a judicial inquiry into the blunders ‘ the end result is that the opportunity for the full chain of those terrible events will never be put in the public domain for justice to be seen to be done			2
’ @entity204 , 52 , the widow of @entity205 , added : ‘ it ’s the cruellest injustice			0
for 32 years we have waited for justice			0
‘ we all had our hopes raised and this has been a total shock			0
it ’s absolutely staggering how many blunders have happened in this case			0
this case has made a mockery of the criminal justice system			0
’ mr @entity40 effectively gave the government 24 hours to respond to his demand for a public inquiry into how the letters were agreed			0
having asked for the @entity220 to be recalled tomorrow , he has made clear the contents of a motion he would put before the @entity223 would be dependent on the government 's response to his demands - prompting the prospect of a resignation and subsequent election			0
deputy prime minister @entity230 said the government was looking ‘ urgently ’ at mr @entity40 's call for a judicial inquiry , but warned against allowing the @entity28 case to escalate into a ‘ full - blown political crisis ’			1
@entity237 's deputy first minister is to hold talks with the @entity92 as a political crisis triggered by the collapse of the @entity8 bomb case continues to threaten the future of the devolved administration in @entity244			1
@entity246 's @entity245 , the deputy first minister , is to meet with @entity16 secretary @entity248 meet at @entity249 to discuss the controversy .			0

former @entity92 refuses to apologise for deals
suspect @entity28 was told he was not wanted by police in 2007
this was despite there being an outstanding warrant against him
familes *furious* over blunder , saying they feel ' devastatingly let down '
