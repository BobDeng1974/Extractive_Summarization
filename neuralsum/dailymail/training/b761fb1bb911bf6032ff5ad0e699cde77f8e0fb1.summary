the amount of life spent in good general health is increasing in @entity10 and @entity15 but falling in @entity4 and @entity5 , according to data from the @entity17 ( @entity17 )			1
could diet be to blame ? @entity4 youngsters can expect to enjoy fewer healthy years compared to the @entity21 ( file picture ) and health authorities in @entity4 and @entity5 should expect increasing demands on services , researchers concluded			1
boys born in @entity10 between 2008 and 2010 , who are expected to live to the age of 78 , are estimated to spend 64 years in good health			1
those born in @entity4 , who are expected to live for almost 76 years , have a ' health life expectancy ' of just under 60 years , data shows			2
