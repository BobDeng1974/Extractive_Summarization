by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:59 est , 24 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:51 est , 24 february 2014 a week - old nearly frozen panther kitten was rescued from a wildlife refuge in southwest @entity6 in mid-january , and biologists say the tiny feline would have died if researchers had n't discovered him			1
officials from the @entity12 said that the abandoned kitten was found at the @entity14 in @entity15			2
the adorable male kitten weighed one pound , had hypothermia , and was n't responsive			1
the wildlife refuge center has documented the kitten 's healing process in heartwarming photographs and on film			0
' but clearly this kitten was in poor condition and almost certainly would have died without intervention			2
' veterinarians at a @entity54 animal hospital performed life - saving measures and gave the kitten 24 - hour care , reports the @entity57			2
when the kitten was strong enough , he was brought to @entity60 in @entity61			0
eventually he will be taken to a fenced wildlife park in @entity63			0
he adorably plays with stuffed animals as if they were his panther mates , drinks from a baby bottle , and smiles lovingly			0
so far he 's gained more than a pound			0
according to a statement by the zoo , this is the fourth kitten and eight panther to receive rehabilitation at the wildlife center			2
the panther kitten smiles for the camera after receiving a little much needed affection from wildlife staff his smiles are a far cry from his lifeless expression when he was discovered in mid-january the panther cub plays with stuffed animals as if they were his panther mates when the panther is healthy he will be placed in an environment similar to his own natural habitat the little panther does n't have a mother so he will have to learn from humans how to survive biologists say that because the kitten did n't learn survival skills from his mother , he wo n't be released into the wild			1
when the kitten is healthy again it will be taken to the @entity98 where visitors will be able to observe him in his natural habitat			1
the @entity102 reports that less than 100 @entity6 panthers remain in the wild			1
they live in southern @entity6 in swamplands like the @entity106 and @entity107			0
because there are so few of these felines in the wild , the species as a whole is threatened by anything from feline disease , car crashes , and habitat loss			0
there are only 100 wild panthers living in the @entity6 and their entire species is threatened the panther will not be able to be released into the wild because it will not have learned survival skills from its mother the once frozen kitten looks much warmer than he did when he was discovered in january the panther has done well at adapting to his new and much warmer environment this panther was the fourth kitten and the ninth panther to be rescued by the wildlife center			1

when researchers found the one - week old panther kitten in january he was frozen , unresponsive , and weighed one pound
he is *slowly* being *nursed* back to health and is in good condition
since he was not taught survival skills by his mother he will not be released into the wild
when the kitten is healthy again it will be taken to the @entity98 where visitors will be able to observe him in his natural habitat
there are less that 100 panthers remaining in the @entity6 wild
