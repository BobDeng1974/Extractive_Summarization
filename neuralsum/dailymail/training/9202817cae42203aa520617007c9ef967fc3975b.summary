clean - cut : but @entity1 had terrifyingly extreme views the sight of @entity1 – tall , clean - cut and dressed in a police uniform – must have at first seemed a reassuring presence to the young members of @entity8 ’s governing @entity7 when they encountered him at their summer camp on the island of @entity11			1
until the moment he opened fire			0
now the 32 - year - old who reportedly shot dead at least 85 victims in cold blood , and killed another seven with the @entity18 bomb , has emerged as a right - wing extremist bitterly opposed to @entity8 ’s tradition of open - minded liberalism			1
his internet postings betray a hatred of multi-culturalism and include offensive references to ‘ @entity27 immigrants with full @entity8 passports ’ living off state benefits and sending money home to their @entity33 relatives			1
@entity34 is known about his early life , however , and there is no clue so far as to why he should have resorted to such terrible acts of violence			0
@entity1 is thought to have grown up in comfortable circumstances and until recently lived with his mother @entity42 in an affluent @entity18 suburb			1
he studied at the city ’s @entity44 , which offers degrees and postgraduate courses , but it is not clear what qualification , if any , he obtained			0
his former landlady in the @entity52 district of the city said last night : ‘ i can not believe he was capable of doing such a thing			0
’ and a man living in the same block of flats said : ‘ he did not appear to be interested in speaking to people and would just walk past neighbours			0
i got the impression he was a mummy ’s boy who did not want to leave home because he had it so good			0
’ @entity1 had no military background beyond the national service all young @entity8 are obliged to undertake			1
nor did he have a criminal record and police say they knew nothing of him until his arrest on friday			1
he was the registered holder of two weapons – a @entity74 pistol and an automatic rifle – both of which are thought to have been used in the massacre at @entity11			0
home : police believe @entity1 planned a killing spree in the tranquil setting of his lakeside farm supplies : several bags of fertiliser were found at @entity1 's house near @entity18 @entity1 moved out of @entity18 two years ago and bought a farm in the town of @entity90 , where he set up an agricultural enterprise dealing in vegetables , melons , roots and tubers			1
the farm consists of a scattering of outbuildings on a grassy slope leading down to a forest - fringed lake			2
it was in this tranquil setting , police believe , that @entity1 planned his devastating attacks			1
using the farm business as cover , he placed an order for six tons of fertiliser with a local supplier two months ago			2
@entity110 , a spokeswoman for the supply firm , said he seemed like any other customer			0
‘ he contacted us in the normal manner , ordered fertiliser and had it delivered , ’ he said			2
these pictures of @entity1 were taken from his @entity120 page , which has now been blocked police at the home of @entity1 , a farm at @entity90 near @entity18 , where he allegedly planned the entire massacre the @entity8 police and security services are investigating possible links between @entity1 and @entity129 far - right groups , including the @entity130			1
he is thought to have posted messages on a @entity8 website expressing admiration for the @entity130 and an extremist group called @entity135 of @entity129			1
it is @entity1 ’s online profile that has provided the authorities with most information about him so far			1
his @entity120 page , which was blocked soon after the killings , listed his interests as bodybuilding , ‘ conservative politics ’ and freemasonry			0
he also had a liking for violent video games and @entity149 tv drama series @entity147 , about a forensic blood spatter pattern expert with the @entity152 police who hunts down and kills criminals in his spare time			0
@entity1 set up a @entity157 account last week in which he hijacked a quotation by the 19th century @entity161 libertarian and philosopher @entity160 @entity160 said : ‘ one person with a belief is equal to a force of 99 who have only interests			1
’ @entity1 changed this to : ‘ one person with a belief is equal to a force of 100,000 who have only interests			1
’ web : @entity1 's sole tweet , posted last week , is attributed to the @entity176 philosopher @entity160 - whose concept of liberty justified the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state control in another message , he expressed concern about the effects of immigration on @entity8 society			1
‘ there are political forces in @entity18 who want mass - subsidised and low - cost “ islam - blocks ” in @entity193 for “ better integration ” , ’ he wrote			2
and on his contacts with the @entity130 , he wrote : ‘ i have on some occasions discussed with			1
the @entity130 and recommended them to use conscious strategies			1
the tactics of the @entity130 is to “ entice ” an overreaction from @entity201 – something they have succeeded several times [ with ] already			1
’ in another posting , dated december 2009 , @entity1 claimed there was no country where @entity33 lived peacefully alongside non-muslims			1
wrecked : the blast in @entity18 was outside a government office according to friends , @entity1 began to espouse extremist views in his late 20s			1
but he was also a member of the second largest party in the @entity8 parliament from 1999 to 2004			1
other members of the centre - right @entity215 described him as ‘ a modest person who seldom engaged in political discussions ’			2
but @entity1 appears to have become disillusioned with mainstream politics			1
he wrote in one internet message that ‘ the vast majority of new faces in the @entity215 are now politically - correct career politicians and not in any way idealists who are willing to take risks and work for idealistic goals ’			2
last night , however , the authorities were still trying to establish a motive for the killings			0
as @entity1 was charged with multiple counts of murder , police said his internet postings suggested he had ‘ some political traits directed towards the right and @entity239 views ’			2
‘ but whether that was a motivation for the actual act remains to be seen , ’ they added			0
analysis by @entity243 the savage , blood - soaked massacre in @entity8 might seem like the act of a deranged madman			1
but the perpetrator , @entity1 , was nothing of the sort			2
in fact , he appears to have been an intelligent , well - educated individual and a competent businessman , who owned a successful farm			0
nothing in either his life story or even in this unprecedented atrocity smacks of wild insanity			0
he planned the whole operation with utter ruthlessness and precision , from using fertiliser from his farm to make the bomb that was planted at the government ’s offices in @entity18 , to disguising himself as a policeman to gain access to the island summer camp			2
fatal : seven people were killed in the @entity18 bomb blast ( pictured ) even as he carried out the mass shooting , he did not exhibit the behaviour of a frenzied lunatic			0
instead , he coldly beckoned his victims towards him and then , like an iron - willed executioner , systematically fired at them			0
tellingly , unlike so many spree killers , including @entity161 ’s own @entity280 in @entity281 and @entity282 in @entity283 , he did not shoot himself , but instead allowed the police to take him into custody			0
the fact that @entity1 was able to perpetrate this monstrous deed is partly a reflection of the extremely liberal gun laws that operate in @entity290			1
much of this huge region is a wilderness , dominated by the untamed forces of nature , and , as a result , the ownership of firearms for hunting and self - protection is widely accepted , just as in the @entity149 the freedom to carry guns is an integral part of society			2
it was this freedom that gave @entity1 his easy access to high - calibre weaponry moreover , his work as a farmer meant that he could acquire fertiliser for his bomb - making without raising any suspicions			1
but ease of access does not explain why he acted as he did			0
after all , despite the prevalence of guns , there has never previously been a crime like this in @entity8 and even in wider @entity290 such mass shootings are extremely rare			2
the only comparable recent events were massacres in @entity321 at @entity322 in 2007 and @entity323 in 2008			0
@entity290 has extremely low overall rates of crime and murder compared with most advanced countries in the western world			0
yet it is a fundamental paradox of @entity290 that , for all the region ’s stability and order , there are deep - seated anxieties about crime and social disintegration			0
beneath the tranquil surface lurks a dark spirit of foreboding			0
that is why there is such an appetite in @entity290 for the violent crime - fiction genre that conveys this atmosphere of menace , as demonstrated by the smash - hit @entity347 tv series @entity348 or the novels of @entity350 , such as @entity351			0
@entity8 has its own acclaimed writer of bestselling thrillers , @entity352			2
his fictional blond , blue - eyed detective @entity355 specialises in catching spree killers			0
this widespread disquiet has been driven partly by concerns that @entity8 ’s national identity and traditional culture are under threat from mass immigration , multiculturalism and militant @entity364			2
many fear that the social contract of mutual responsibility which once built @entity290 ’s famously generous welfare system is now dissolving in the more fluid , globalised world .			0

@entity1 posted online about ' @entity27 immigrants with full @entity8 passports '
he had no military background or criminal record
@entity8 's *lax* gun laws allowed him to **buy** two firearms
as a farmer , he could **buy** fertiliser to make bombs without arousing suspicion
he had made contact with the @entity130 and other far - right organisations
