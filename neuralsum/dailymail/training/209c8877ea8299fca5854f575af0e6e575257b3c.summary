by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 13:07 est , 28 november 2012 a father helped his son and two friends kidnap a 13 - year - old boy and bundle him into his car boot during ' a stupid prank that went very wrong '			1
the trio of 14 - year - olds wore balaclavas and even put on a fake accent to scare the victim during the bizarre incident in @entity13 , @entity14 , last year			1
a court heard how the young victim had been walking along a street when a black car suddenly pulled up and three older boys got out wearing balaclavas which they had picked up from an earlier go karting party			1
terrifying : the 13 - year - old victim told a youth court he ' thought he was going to die ' during the prank by three older boys wearing balaclavas ( file picture ) and one of their fathers with one speaking in a @entity31 accent , they forced him into the boot before the father drove off			1
a short time later the teenagers uncovered their faces and let the victim out			2
he told @entity37 : ' i really did not know what was happening			0
i thought i was going to die			1
' he added that he thought it was like something ‘ from a movie ’			2
when he realised who the boys were he told his own father and the family contacted police			2
two of the boys were charged with kidnapping and faced prison before the @entity53 eventually agreed to reduce it to common assault			0
but the remaining offender and his father , who were both @entity58 and believed to be the ringleaders of the stunt , moved out of @entity13 and returned to the @entity58 before charges could be brought			1
none of the boys or the adult can be identified for legal reasons			0
legal representatives for the defendants said the group had been driving along the road when they thought it would be ‘ a good idea to play a prank ’ on the 13 - year - old - but that no malice had been intended			2
solicitor @entity75 , representing one of the boys , said it was ' a prank which had gone very wrong '			0
bizarre : the victim had been walking down a street in @entity13 , @entity14 , when a car suddenly pulled up and the trio got out wearing balaclavas he said the @entity58 boy 's father had an ‘ over indulgent relationship with his son and friends ’			1
lawyer @entity91 , for the other defendant , said it was a ‘ stupid plan hatched quickly '			0
he said : ' it beggars belief that an adult in the car drove it off , he should not have stopped the car in the first place			2
it was a completely inappropriate prank which went so wrong			0
' the boys , both from @entity13 , @entity14 , both admitted assault			1
prosecutor @entity103 said the victim ’s mother , who ‘ occupied a responsible position in society ’ , had built bridges with the defendants ’ families and agreed that the charges could be reduced to common assault			1
sitting with their parents , one told the magistrates : ' it was a stupid idea			0
' the other said : ' it was a stupid idea - a good joke at the time			0
' the pair were warned they could have been jailed if the original kidnapping charges had been pursued			0
both boys were given a six month referral order and told to pay £ 50 each to the victim and £ 45 costs each .			0
