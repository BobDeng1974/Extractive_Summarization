crusade : @entity1 , pictured with a chicken , will campaign against a trade deal @entity1 is planning a campaign to stop @entity6 food standards being lowered to allow @entity8 food imports pumped full of pesticides and hormones into the @entity6			1
the tv chef hopes to intervene to stop a trade agreement between the @entity13 and @entity8 aimed at removing trade barriers between member states			1
mr @entity1 , 39 , claims the ' dangerous ' @entity18 ( @entity17 ) deal could undo ' decades of work ' by getting round bans imposed by the @entity13 on putting growth hormones and pesticides in meat			1
the same restrictions do not exist in @entity8 - and at present if @entity8 companies want to export food to the @entity13 they must ensure it meets the higher standards			1
speaking to the @entity28 , mr @entity1 said : ' [ the deal ] has the capacity to be very negative to @entity6 public health and @entity6 companies and @entity6 farmers			2
' we do n't have hormones in our meat , that 's banned			2
we do n't have hundreds of poisons and pesticides that have been proven to be carcinogenic			0
their laws , their set - up , their safety regulations are nowhere near ours			0
' he said he has tried to lobby @entity46 , the former @entity8 secretary of state , on the issue , but was n't able to show her a video message he recorded on the subject			2
the agreement could also open the @entity13 to chickens containing arsenic , poultry that has been chemically washed , and pesticides used on fruit and vegetables			1
a report from the @entity72 , a @entity8 lobby group , raised fears that the negotiations will ' dismantle many food safety regulations that corporations view as impediments to trade and profitmaking ' and criticised the ' shroud of secrecy ' under which negotiations are being conducted			1
mr @entity1 has previously launched food campaigns in the @entity6 , notably on the standard of school dinners			2
profits from @entity1 's cookbooks have started drying up , according to new business records			0
@entity88 , the company which incudes his publishing and tv interests , recorded a £ 3.6million drop in profits this year - a fall of 37 per cent			0
new accounts , seen by the @entity28 , say that 2012 profits were £ 9.8million , while for 2013 they were only £ 6.2million			0
the company said the slump was because ' heavy investment ' had damaged returns in the short term			0
@entity1 cookbooks topped bestellers ' lists in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 - but performed worse last @entity102 .			0
