by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 16 april 2013 hearing : @entity1 has won her employment tribunal claim after she was sacked by @entity3 when they found out she was suing her previous employer for £ 1m a top @entity6 banker sacked from her new job after bosses found out she was suing her old firm for sex discrimination has won her employment tribunal claim			1
@entity1 resigned as vice president and director of financial giant @entity13 and launched a bid to sue the bank for £ 1million over claims men were promoted ahead of her and received bigger bonuses			1
she then moved to rival banking giant @entity3 but was sacked when her new bosses found out about her claim against @entity13 , just a month after she took up her new post			1
she then took that firm to an employment tribunal - claiming victimisation and sex discrimination now she is in line for a major pay - out after the @entity28 tribunal ruled that she was victimised at @entity3 and criticised the firm ’s ' extreme reaction '			1
however , her claim for sex discrimination against @entity3 was dismissed			1
the tribunal ruled : ' we find that the respondent victimised the claimant for having brought sex discrimination proceedings against her former employer and subjected her to the detriment of dismissal			1
' miss @entity1 had told the tribunal that she initially kept her original claim secret from her new employers because she feared they would n’t offer her the £ 150,000 a year post as head of product engineering			1
however , just two weeks after taking up her new job at @entity3 a press report about her employment tribunal claim against @entity13 was seen by her new bosses			1
she was sacked for a ‘ breakdown of trust ’ just five days after the article was published			2
ms @entity1 was escorted to her desk to collect her bag and then to reception to hand in her security passes before being escorted off the premises			1
she received a letter a few days later stating that she had been sacked because she had ' withheld information material to the @entity13			1
' @entity3 strongly refuted her claims , and said that when interviewed for the job she said that she left @entity13 because ' there was a lot of competition for positions ' and she ' wanted a career break '			1
however , the tribunal concluded : ' we find that the reason for the respondent ’s decision to dismiss the claimant was that she had brought tribunal proceedings			0
' the respondent denies this and says that it was her failure to disclose the proceedings rather than the fact she had taken them which was the reason			0
' we do not accept that she misled the respondents at any stage			0
when asked direct questions she gave direct answers			0
they may not have been entirely full answers but that is not a matter of misleading or being dishonest			0
' had the respondent probed deeper , the claimant would have then had to decide whether to answer the more detailed questions or not , but failure to answer questions that were not asked does not in our view amount to a lack of honesty or trust			0
' taking action : ms @entity1 launched a bid to sue @entity13 for sexual discrimination over claims men received bonuses three times larger than hers case : ms @entity1 was then sacked by her new employer @entity3 when they found out about the case			1
she then accused them of unfair dismissal , and won today the tribunal added : ' there is no evidence that the claimant at any stage neglected her duties to the @entity13 and there is no suggestion that she acted unprofessionally in any of her dealings albeit she had not been a the @entity13 very long			2
' in conclusion we find that the respondent had an immediate and emotional response to the claimant ’s disclosure that she had brought discrimination proceedings against her former employer			2
' we find that they were uncomfortable with this and decided not to continue with the relationship because this was not the sort of person they wanted to employ			0
” miss @entity1 had told the tribunal she was likened to a common criminal by @entity3 ’s senior hr partner @entity136 and was left feeling “ distressed , demeaned and humiliated ” by her new bosses			1
she said : ' towards the end of the conversation @entity140 compared me to someone who had been shoplifting and said that should be disclosed			0
' i was shocked and said how could he compare me to a shoplifter , and said there was no similarity between my case and shoplifting			2
' i said that i was the victim in my claims			0
it seemed to me that they were just looking for an excuse to dismiss me			0
the meeting upset me a lot			0
i had been compared to a criminal			0
i felt that for him i was guilty until proven innocent			0
i left the meeting feeling terrible , humiliated and very worried about my future			0
' miss @entity1 was dismissed from her job at @entity3 on june 11 last year - less than a month after she was appointed to the post			1
a @entity3 spokesman said : ' @entity3 welcomes the tribunal ’s decision to dismiss the sexual discrimination claim against the @entity13 and is considering its legal options with regards to the other part of the claim			1
' @entity170 was dismissed for a breach of trust and confidence after having failed adequately to disclose the true reasons for leaving her former employer			2
she , like many employees of @entity3 was in a role of significant trust and responsibility			2
honesty and trustworthiness are paramount to the @entity13 and its customers			2
' we are committed to ensuring a positive , motivating and rewarding working environment that enables staff to reach their full potential with systems of training and support and , unusually for businesses of its kind , a policy of balancing individual needs with those of the bank			0
