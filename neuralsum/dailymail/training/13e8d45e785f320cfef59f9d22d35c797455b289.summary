the @entity0 has agreed to expunge the records of the 31 high school students who were suspended for violating their school ’s sexual harassment policy after making a twerking video on campus			1
an agreement was reached thursday after parents of the juniors and seniors at @entity11 filed two appeal			2
the district will erase mention of the discipline from the student records - meaning the suspensions wo n't show up on the students ' transcripts when applying for college			2
parents of several students went to a lawyer after the school board said it could n't overturn the suspensions			1
attorney @entity34 , who represents three of the girls , says she 's thrilled by the agreement and so are her clients			0
‘ they have been through an enormous amount , ’ the @entity39 professor told @entity40			0
‘ they have been publicly vilified			0
they have been called all kinds of names by all kinds of people			0
’ ' they have been through an enormous amount ' : attorney for three of the girls @entity34 says the @entity0 needs to re-evaluate its policies popular girls : the 31 students , most of them girls , were suspended after the video they shot and edited on campus gained massive attention on @entity61 in may voluntary : the students decided to make a ' twerking ' video during class but say they did n't know where it was going to end up			1
it eventually was cut into a parody music video and put on @entity61 the district , meanwhile , says now it 's time for everyone to move on			1
‘ the parents , students , school and district are ready to move beyond this incident and focus on the upcoming school year , ’ the school district said in a statement			1
‘ the district can not provide any further details since this is a student discipline issue and therefore confidential			0
’ but @entity34 said the incident should be a learning opportunity more than just something to move on from			0
‘ i look forward to having the school resolve some of the internal issues that propelled this and to changing some of their processes and i think they will , ’ she said			2
the drama began when students at @entity11 in @entity23 reportedly volunteered to ' twerk ' on camera , and then another student filmed the video and edited it into a compiled music video in order to get in on the latest internet craze			1
breaking the rules : the video was filmed at the school using school property before being uploaded online no turning back : the video has since been taken down from @entity61 but it was recorded by others administrators at @entity11 argue that the students were in violation of the school 's honor code when they performed the sexually suggestive dance move , which involves girls shaking their hips and boys watching them do so			1
according to @entity116 , the content is considered a breach of the school 's handbook which specifically states that students are barred from ' verbal , visual , or physical conduct of a sexual nature made by someone from or in the educational setting			1
' the whole situation started when student @entity127 , 17 , suggested in journalism class that they ' make a twerking video ' , and his classmates all willingly participated			2
' nobody was offended or anything			0
it was like , " oh , that ’s cool , " ' he told @entity136			0
part of the problem is that it was shot and edited on school grounds , meaning that the school 's honor code allows the school to discipline their behavior			1
breaking code : students thought that they were having fun but now they will be missing out on the fun of prom poor taste : the person who filmed and uploaded the video said that he has not heard of anyone complaining about the suggestive dance moves or the foul - mouthed lyrics blurred : @entity116 blurred the faces of all of the students in the video to hide their identity @entity127 argues that he should not be punished because he did not appear in the video , simply suggesting the idea			1
others feel he is the ' ringleader ' who edited the footage and added the music to go along with the video			2
it is unclear what grades all of the offenders are in , but if the more than 30 students are all seniors , that will make a difference on graduation day as the graduating class is made up of about 600 students			0
it 's a craze : @entity172 has posted photos and videos of herself ' twerking ' had some practice : @entity172 admitted during an interview that she is a fan of twerking			0

the students recorded and edited the video on campus in may
the video quickly went viral on @entity61 and school officials claimed the students had violated sexual harassment policies
many parents quickly hired attorneys and the school board has now backed down
