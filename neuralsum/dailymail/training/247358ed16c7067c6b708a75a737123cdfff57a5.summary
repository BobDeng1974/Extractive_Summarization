your 3 p.m. walk to the office vending machine may soon get a lot happier			1
at least three companies are currently developing vending machines for marijuana after @entity7 and @entity8 recently legalized it 's recreational use			1
retail sale is expected to start in @entity7 by january 2014 with @entity8 following shortly after			1
only one company has an actual model in use , and that 's @entity17 - based @entity16 - run by chiropractor @entity18 , ' the @entity19 of medical marijuana dispensing			1
' @entity21 or @entity22 ? : @entity16 's machine , right , is the only patented marijuana vending machine and can currently be used at medical dispensaries in @entity17			1
a newer option from @entity27 , left , was developed with the recreational user in mind ' we 're the only patented game in town , ' @entity18 told @entity33			1
' i 'm not concerned necessarily about the competition , generally speaking			0
' @entity16 made $ 1.75 million last quarter			0
but there are other companies creeping up on his business model - and tailoring to the two states that have already legalized recreational marijuana			1
@entity42 - based @entity27 has already bought up two smaller firms , @entity43 and @entity44 and aims to distribute machines in legalized states			2
customers of @entity27 's machines would n't be medical patients like @entity16 's users			2
they would be recreational users just wanting to pick up weed , and not deal with the hassle of the middle man			2
users would be able to order an amount of marijuana from the machine 's app on their @entity59 , and then go to a retail center to pick it up			2
at the machine , they would also be able to add rolling papers or a cigarette lighter to their order			0
the machines could also be used to sell pre-packaged cannabis goodies , such as brownies or cookies			0
cannabis confections : in addition to marijuana , @entity71 envisions his machines being able to sell rolling papers , lighters , and even sweets spiked with pot such as pre-packaged brownies and cookies ' the way we see it , when you walk into a shop , you do n't need the expert or aficionado to help with your selection , ' said @entity27 's ceo @entity71			2
' the people who are using this in the recreational space - they know what they want , and they do n't want to hear the whole spiel every time			0
' @entity71 has high hopes for this burgeoning industry : ' it 's like a gold rush			0
once significant investment capital comes to the market who knows ? ' but @entity18 thinks that 's still a ways off - even in legalized states where selling weed in vending machines would need to get approval			1
' i think that 's still a couple of years down the road			0
' slow and steady is how he sees the marijuana vending industry going : ' some people want to see this free - flowing marijuana			1
they want to go from federal and state ban to marijuana for everybody , ' @entity18 said			0
' we do n't believe that can happen			0
in order to gain respect and trust , it 's better to go through gradual , medical adoption			0
' another company , @entity127 , announced in april that they would be entering the marijuana vending business as well			1
@entity129 , who sold @entity43 to @entity27 , has been in the vending machine industry for almost a 10 years and has seen how quickly the industry has changed when it 's come to weed vending			1
' back in 2009 , you 'd go to these conventions and you 'd see people trying to unload 80 pounds of weed , ' @entity129 said			0
' now , you 'll see people buttoned up and trying to figure out solutions for what 's a real industry			0
' not yet : @entity18 believes it 's going to take longer for vending machines to get approved - even in legalized states			2

*entrepreneurs* are looking to cash in on the marijuana vending machine market in @entity7 and @entity8 , where marijuana was recently legalized
there are already a few machines on the market in @entity17 medical dispensaries , but new machines will focus on the recreational user
