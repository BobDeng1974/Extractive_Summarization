by @entity0 @entity1 already watched one son die in agony from @entity4 – helpless to relieve his pain			1
so after hearing a second son had the same rare and terminal condition , she found some solace when doctors said a new procedure could relieve his agony			2
but this small comfort was cruelly taken away when just weeks before @entity15 , 13 , was due to have the operation , @entity13 bosses refused to pay due to funding cuts			1
terminally ill teenager @entity18 was denied @entity13 funding for an operation to reduce his pain			1
but thanks to hundreds of @entity24 readers donating money to his fund , the youngster will be able to have the procedure privately @entity15 ( pictured with his parents , @entity30 and @entity31 ) has a very rare genetic condition called @entity4 , which has already killed one of his brothers @entity15 has lost most of the movement in his muscles , meaning he is in constant pain and confined to a wheelchair			1
while the procedure wo n’t save his life , it could prolong it significantly and at the very least make it a lot more comfortable			0
mrs @entity1 , 45 , said : ‘ all we want to do is make @entity15 as happy and pain - free as possible and they ’ve taken that from us			1
‘ it breaks my heart to hear him cry out in pain at night and not be able to do anything about it			0
there is nothing worse for a mother			0
’ it is not known how many weeks , months , or years @entity15 has left to live , but a child with the genetic disorder is only expected to live to the age of around six or seven			1
the mother of two , who lost her son @entity31 to the disease at the age of just four on christmas eve in 2000 , said : ‘ it makes me angry that a topless model is allowed to have a boob job on the @entity13 for cosmetic reasons or someone can have a tummy tuck , but a poorly child has to suffer			2
’ @entity15 ( pictured as a child with his older brother , @entity71 , who has asperger syndrome ) has lost most of his movement as a result of his illness and it causes him extreme pain ‘ if a child is in pain and something can be done about it , how they can be denied treatment ? ’ @entity15 ’s @entity84 first recommended the procedure , called selective dorsal rhizotomy ( @entity87 ) , which is often also used to treat children with cerebral palsy			1
in october last year he was put on a waiting list for the operation at the @entity92 in @entity93			0
but they received a letter in the post in february , weeks before he was due to have the operation , saying due to @entity13 funding cuts they could no longer fund it			1
aspring glamour model @entity100 sparked outrage after her @entity13 - funded boob job - which has since been reversed - on the @entity13 as the @entity104 reported earlier this year , while children such as @entity15 - and many suffering with cerebral palsy - are being refused funding for life - changing surgery such as a selective dorsal rhizotomy , there is plenty of cash to pay for cosmetic procedures			1
the case of @entity100 sparked outrage when it emerged she had received breast enlargement on the @entity13 - and , after tiring of her new assets , a tax - payer funded reduction , too			1
ms @entity100 had her @entity121 breasts enlarged to a @entity122 with taxpayers ’ money , after saying her flat chest was ‘ ruining her life ’			0
her operation came after she was recommended for funding by her local gp			0
under @entity13 guidelines , cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances when it is needed ‘ to protect a person ’s health ’			1
then there was the case of morbidly obese @entity137 , who cost the @entity13 £ 15,000 by having a gastric band fitted - then having it removed when she decided she preferred being fat			1
' we were all excited about it and getting ready for it , ’ she said			0
‘ we have tried to fight it , tried to re-appeal saying @entity15 is a special case but they just said a blanket “ no ” response			2
it ’s like talking to robots			0
‘ the people making these decisions are n’t from a medical background , so there ’s no talking to them			0
’ mrs @entity1 and her husband , @entity31 , 52 , who live with @entity15 and his brother , @entity71 , 20 , who has @entity160 , have been forced to try and raise the money themselves and have set up a funding page online			1
‘ we will do whatever it takes , ’ she said			0
the couple have so far raised £ 3,000 through local fundraising events – a long way from the £ 9,898 they need for the procedure			0
@entity15 , a ‘ happy child ’ given his circumstances and a @entity174 fan , spends his life in a wheelchair and is unable to sit up by himself			2
the teenager , who is much smaller than most boys his age , has very stiff limbs and one leg is stuck in one position , causing him extreme pain			0
@entity15 ( pictured with his parents ) was offered surgery to reduce his pain by cutting some of the nerves in his back			1
however , the offer of @entity13 funding was then withdrawn due to funding cuts @entity15 's parents , @entity30 and @entity31 ( pictured with their other son , @entity71 ) , are now trying to raise £ 10,000 to pay for him to have the operation very little is known about the inherited disorder that affects the central nervous system and there is little by way of treatment			1
the @entity87 operation is the only way @entity15 ’s pain can be relieved without the risk of serious side - effects			1
it works by cutting the nerves in his back , enabling his limbs to move more freely and therefore making him a lot more comfortable			1
mrs @entity1 , who with her husband is a full time carer for her two boys , but also volunteers to help other parents with disabled children , said : ‘ because he is in so much pain , he is not sleeping			2
‘ it ’s all about energy and when they get tired , they ’re more prone to getting infections and then their health goes downhill			0
‘ at the moment he has fits most evenings which is very frightening which keeps him awake			0
’ mrs @entity1 ( pictured with her husband and sons , @entity15 and @entity71 ) says it is unacceptable the @entity13 will pay for weight loss surgery and for boob jobs but it will not pay for surgery to relieve the suffering of a dying teenager mrs @entity1 ( pictured with her husband , @entity31 ) said : ' all we want to do is make @entity15 as happy and pain - free as possible and they 've taken that from us ' @entity4 is a severe neurological disorder which usually starts to show symptoms during the first year of life			1
it causes the progressive loss of mental abilities and of movement			0
it is usually fatal within a couple of years as it causes respiratory failure			0
severe muscle and movement problems then develop and these cause loss of feeling in the limbs , weakness and balance problems			0
eye , heart and breathing problems are also common in people with @entity4			2
the symptoms are caused by patches of damaged tissue that develop in the brains of patients and these lesions are often accompanied by the loss of the nerve coatings			0
this reduces the ability of the nerves to activate the muscles used for movement and to relay sensory information to the brain			2
the condition occurs in about one in 40,000 babies			0
the condition is caused by mutations in one of more than 30 different genes			2
source : @entity279 @entity15 can only say a few words as the condition also affects the respiratory system			1
but mrs @entity1 said if it was n’t for his condition , @entity15 would be ‘ a typical 13 - year - old ’			1
‘ he ’s such a character and very mischievous , ’ she said			0
‘ he likes the baddies in films			0
most kids are frightened of @entity289 and @entity290 but from a young age he just thought they were funny			0
’ there have been several cases this year where poorly children have been refused funding due to cuts			1
in march two - year - old @entity298 who suffers with cerebral palsy was told she could n’t have an operation that would help her walk			0
a @entity104 campaign helped raise the money so she could have the operation			0
meanwhile , around 5,400 gastric bypasses and 1,300 gastric band procedures are performed by the @entity13 each year and in 2012 it spent £ 3.5million on 790 breast implant operations			2
it is estimated @entity4 occurs in one in every 40,000 live births , though certain populations have considerably higher rates			2
@entity313 , @entity314 , for @entity315 said : ‘ our exceptional funding request to @entity317 for @entity15 ’s surgery was unsuccessful			1
we continue to meet with the family as they explore self - funding @entity15 ’s surgery			1
’ visit www.gofundme.com/8i3518 contribute to @entity15 ’s @entity87 fund .			2
