@entity0 are confident @entity2 ’s punishment for breaching financial fairplay regulations will be lifted this summer which would allow them to bid for stellar names like @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
city boss @entity10 has been hampered over the past year by @entity2 restricting them to a net transfer spend of £ 49million in each window and keeping the club ’s overall wage bill to its current level of £ 205million - a - year			1
@entity2 ’s settlement with @entity0 published in may stated those penalties would remain in place until the end of the 2015/16 season but the club ’s latest financial figures showed drastically - reduced losses of £ 23million which they feel proves they are now compliant with @entity27 regulations			1
@entity10 is hoping that the financial restrictions imposed by @entity2 for a breach of @entity31 rules will be lifted at the end of this season @entity0 have been limited to a net spend of £ 49million in the last two transfer windows - they spent £ 25m bringing @entity34 in from @entity35 in january ahead of monday night ’s trip to @entity37 , @entity10 was certainly talking like a man excited at the prospect of signing ' crack ' players this summer			1
‘ i think that next season we do n’t have any restrictions so we will be in the same position that all the other @entity47 clubs have , ’ said @entity10			2
you have so many strong teams here in @entity47 and in @entity51 , you can not allow them to keep the advantage every year ; having less players to put in your squad or spending less money			0
we spend money , of course we always spend money , but they spent more			0
’ @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 have all paid more in transfer fees in the past 12 months than @entity0 who were traditionally @entity2 ’s biggest spenders after the club was taken over by @entity68 owners in 2008			1
@entity2 also ordered @entity0 to play with a reduced squad from 25 players to 21 in the @entity51 this season and while that restriction has now ended , any time reduction in the penalties on spending and wages is more controversial			1
@entity63 have paid more in transfer fees than @entity0 in the last 12 months , including £ 30m on @entity78 the document published last may by @entity2 ’s @entity81 investigative chamber explicitly said @entity0 ’s financial penalties would run for two seasons at least and there has been no official deviation from that decision			1
the published statement said at the time : ‘ @entity0 agrees to significantly limit spending in the transfer market for the seasons 2014/15 and 2015/16			1
it means @entity0 will have to argue their case with @entity2 that as they have been financially compliant over the past year , they deserve to be free of restrictions moving forward			1
they have successfully argued their case with @entity2 before			2
last summer they persuaded the governing body to allow them to bypass the normal quota of eight homegrown players as their @entity51 squad had been reduced			0
@entity99 joined the champions from @entity101 for £ 32m last summer the reigning @entity103 champions have only paid money for @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity99 and @entity34 in the last two transfer windows and that was part - paid by the sales of @entity110 and @entity111			2
@entity10 admitted they were n’t in a position to compete with neighbours united for established world stars like @entity116 because of the @entity31 penalties			2
it has cost @entity0 on the pitch			2
even if they win their remaining eight @entity103 fixtures their points tally will be lower than last season and they crashed out once again at the last - 16 stage of the @entity51			0
@entity10 and director of football @entity123 both accept the squad needs replenishing and they want to be in the market for the top available players			0
@entity0 have been heavily linked with a move for former @entity129 midfielder @entity8 the club also want to be involved in any race for @entity62 contract rebel @entity6 they have been strongly linked with former @entity129 winger @entity8 who has been one of the best players in the @entity133 with @entity134			1
and if @entity62 do allow @entity6 to leave , @entity0 want to be involved in the chase for one of @entity47 ’s most outstanding talents to help fit in with quotas for homegrown players			0
‘ if you are the manager or a player of a big tem , you are always open to criticism because everyone expects a high level of performance , ’ he said			0
‘ the major issue with our team always seems to be the money but this season i think we were the team that spent less than any other team			0
that is the weird thing			0
‘ for this club trying to be a big team in so few years , maybe we are paying the cost for that			0
’ since the transfer penalties were introduced , @entity0 have spent £ 91million on players in the last two windows ( @entity162 spend £ 68million )			1
that compares to @entity60 £ 145.5million , @entity62 £ 113million , @entity63 £ 92.5million and @entity129 £ 82.6million			0
over the same time period @entity61 spent £ 118.3million on players and @entity165 £ 81.2million though they also broke the world transfer record for @entity7 the previous summer .			0

@entity0 have been restricted to a net transfer spend of £ 49m
club *'s* also had to keep overall wage bill to its current level of £ 205m
punishments imposed by @entity2 for breaching @entity31 rules
the spending restrictions were set for this season and the next one
but @entity0 are confident they will be lifted early after their compliance
