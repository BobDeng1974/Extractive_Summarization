horses are the latest victims of the obesity crisis as they take the burden of their overweight riders , experts have warned			1
a study found a third of recreational riders were too obese for their mounts , leaving the animals at risk of health problems such as back pain and lameness			1
they can also develop behavioural problems , such as bucking , rearing and problems following commands			0
horses are the latest to suffer from the obesity crisis - because riders are too heavy for them , say researchers @entity23 , one of the scientists behind the research , said : ‘ people tend to think horses are such big animals they must be okay , and not to take notice of the weight issue of riders			1
but the health impact on the horse can be quite extreme , quite quickly			2
’ published in the @entity35 , the study assessed 152 horses and their adult riders from stables across @entity39 and @entity40			1
guidelines set by vets state that riders should weigh less than 10 per cent of the weight of their horse			1
but researchers from @entity47 in @entity40 found that just 5 per cent of the riders passed the test			2
riders should weight no more than 10 per cent of their horse 's weight to prevent it from suffering from health problems as it adjusts to its load , scientists at @entity47 said thirty - two per cent weighed more than 15 per cent of the weight of their animal , a level considered to pose a welfare risk			1
the remaining 63 per cent tipped the scales at between 10 and 15 per cent of the weight of their horse – a level seen as ‘ satisfactory ’			1
miss @entity23 , who conducted the study with @entity64 , said guidelines should be put into place to protect horses from overweight riders			2
she added : ‘ the problem is that these ratios are not widely known by people in the horse industry			0
people do seem generally to be a bit heavy for horses			2
that is just a consequence , i suppose , of our average weights going up			0
it is definitely a potential welfare issue			0
these are broad - brush guidelines			0
‘ they do n’t take account of all factors , such as the age of the horse , the breed , the style of riding or the experience of the rider			0
‘ but they are still important and helpful and people are not taking enough notice of them			0
’ @entity96 , president of the @entity97 , said his members spent a large part of their time dealing with lameness and back problems , which is often be caused by ‘ the wrong riders on the wrong horses ’			1
he added : ‘ many riding schools are very aware of these problems and exactly who can ride which horses and who can not , but there are some horse people who may not fully understand the issues			2
‘ there is a discussion which needs to take place in the horse riding community			0
there needs to be an awareness that some larger riders need to ride bigger horses			0

only one in *20* riders are within the *optimum* weight for their horse
a heavy load can mean back pain , lameness and bad behaviour in horses
vet guidelines *advise* that riders weigh less than 10 per cent of their mount
weighing more than 15 per cent of horse 's weight poses health risks
