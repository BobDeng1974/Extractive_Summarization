the @entity10 chief secretary to the treasury told the @entity11 that the first minister should stop ‘ hiding away ’ and go head to head with him			2
the challenge came after mr @entity1 accused the @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity10 of trying to ' bully ' him with an unprecedented cross-party warning that an independent @entity4 would not be allowed to keep the pound			1
clash : @entity1 was challenged to a debate on the future of @entity4 by @entity10 @entity0 , the most senior @entity24 in the @entity26 government mr @entity0 dismissed the @entity28 's claims that an independent @entity4 could or should be able to share the pound as ' pure fiction '			1
conservative chancellor @entity31 insisted the pound was not like a cd collection to be divided in a ' a messy divorce ' and @entity17 's @entity35 accused nationalists of not living in the real world			1
it is a devastating blow for @entity28 first minister mr @entity1 ’s campaign to persuade the @entity4 to vote to break away , leading him to grumble that about a bid by the ' @entity42 establishment to bully and intimidate '			1
mr @entity1 , the leader of the @entity28 , has challenged @entity43 to debate him			0
but the prime minister has declined on the grounds that the independence debate should be between @entity4 and amid fears in @entity48 that a @entity16 leader puts off @entity4 voters			2
today mr @entity0 accused the first minister of cowardice for refusing to debate			2
mr @entity0 told the @entity11 that he – not @entity4 secretary @entity0 or no campaign leader @entity53 – is the most senior @entity24 in the @entity26 government and he should go head - to - head with mr @entity1			1
mr @entity31 used a speech in @entity57 to insist the currency was not like a @entity33 collection to be divided up in the event of a ' messy divorce ' mr @entity0 said : ‘ i ’d like to debate @entity1			1
i will meet him any time , any place , anywhere			0
it ’s time that @entity1 got out of his bunker and started to engage in the debate with people in @entity4 , who have a vote in this referendum , who disagree with him			2
‘ i ’m the most senior @entity24 in the @entity70			0
if he wants to debate the @entity26 government i am available any time			0
he ’s welcome to come to the @entity72 any time			0
‘ it ’s about time that rather than hiding behind the bogus challenge to @entity43			0
‘ it ’s a way to avoid debate rather than seek it out			0
this has to be settled by people in @entity4			2
the participants in this debate should be people who have a vote			0
‘ i ’ve offered to debate him			0
@entity53 — the leader of the @entity82 campaign — has offered to debate him			0
’ mr @entity0 admitted that @entity84 have failed to make a strong enough or a positive enough case			2
‘ we have to step up our argument because this is the most important decision facing our country			0
this is the most important decision we will make in my political lifetime			0
‘ the @entity28 ’s argument is based on asserting things that simply are n’t true			0
they assert that the rest of the @entity26 will sign up to a currency union			1
they assert that an independent @entity4 will have much more money to spend on all the expensive promises they have made — and yet the opposite is the case			1
' mr @entity31 also visited @entity101 near @entity102 , but did not look like he was enjoying it mr @entity31 said is clear that as chancellor he could not recommend that the @entity26 could share the pound with an independent @entity106 conservative chancellor @entity31 : the evidence shows it would n’t work			1
it would cost jobs and cost money and would n’t provide economic security for @entity4 or for the rest of the @entity26			2
people need to know – that is not going to happen			0
' @entity10 chief secretary to the treasury @entity0 : ' this is n't bluff , or bullying , it 's a statement of fact			1
the @entity28 's claims that an independent @entity4 could or should be able to share the pound are pure fiction			1
' @entity17 shadow chancellor @entity35 : ' you ’d be trying to negotiate a monetary union as @entity4 is pulling away from the @entity26			1
it wo n’t happen , i would n’t recommend it			0
@entity4 will not keep the pound if @entity4 chooses independence			2
' the @entity4 government wants to keep the pound if there is a ‘ yes ’ vote in the independence referendum due to take place in september			1
@entity4 nationalists accused the ‘ @entity42 establishment ’ of attempting to bully @entity4 into rejecting independence – and threatening to refuse to assume their share of the @entity26 ’s debts in retaliation			1
mr @entity1 said : ' this is a concerted bid by a @entity16 - led @entity42 establishment to bully and intimidate but their efforts to claim ownership of @entity148 will backfire spectacularly			2
' the stance of any @entity26 government will be very different the day after a @entity152 vote to the campaign rhetoric we are hearing now			0
' but mr @entity31 used a speech in @entity57 today to insist : ' if @entity4 walks away from the @entity26 , it walks away from the @entity26 pound			1
' mr @entity31 went on : ' the @entity4 government say “ it ’s as much @entity4 ’s pound as the rest of the @entity26 ’s ”			1
they are like an angry party to a messy divorce			0
' but the pound is n’t an asset to be divided up between the two countries after break - up as if it were a cd collection			0
' the value of the pound does n’t lie in the paper and ink that ’s used to print it			0
the value of the pound lies in the entire monetary system underpinning it			0
' mr @entity31 insisted he wants @entity4 to keep the pound and the economic security that it brings			1
but he added : ' it is clear to me i could not as chancellor recommend that we could share the pound with an independent @entity4			1
' the evidence shows it would n’t work			0
it would cost jobs and cost money and would n’t provide economic security for @entity4 or for the rest of the @entity26			2
' i do n’t think any other chancellor of the exchequer would come to a different view			0
the @entity4 government says that if @entity4 becomes independent there will be a currency union and @entity4 will share the pound			1
' people need to know – that is not going to happen			0
' the chancellor later visited @entity196 , an export - driven business in @entity198 , @entity4 that specialises in the relocation and installation of industrial machinery and equipment the blunt warning from mr @entity31 was immediately matched by mr @entity0 , the @entity10 chief secretary to the treasury , who dismissed claims @entity4 could keep the pound as ' pure fiction '			1
he said : ' a currency union would leave the rest of the @entity26 highly exposed to fiscal and financial risks from a separate @entity4			1
' as a @entity24 and as @entity10 chief secretary to the @entity212 , on the basis of this analysis , i could n't recommend a currency union to the people of @entity4 and my party could n't agree to such a proposition for the rest of the @entity26			1
' this is n't bluff , or bullying , it 's a statement of fact			2
the @entity28 's claims that an independent @entity4 could or should be able to share the pound are pure fiction			1
' when we vote in september , no one in @entity4 should vote for independence in the belief that we could keep the pound			2
' and @entity17 's @entity35 added : ' it would be bad for @entity4 , it would place an unacceptable burden on the @entity26 taxpayer , it would repeat the mistakes of the euro area			1
' in fact worse , you ’d be trying to negotiate a monetary union as @entity4 is pulling away from the @entity26			2
it wo n’t happen , i would n’t recommend it			0
@entity4 will not keep the pound if @entity4 chooses independence			2
' deputy first minister @entity244 accused @entity42 parties of trying to ' bully ' @entity4 ministers have already said it is ‘ unlikely ’ that the rest of the @entity26 would agree to a currency union , but it is a major blow for mr @entity1 that all three main parties have gone further than that to rule out any such arrangement			1
@entity4 deputy first minister @entity244 said : ‘ people wo n’t take kindly to the @entity42 establishment ganging up to try to bully @entity4 in the decision that we are being asked to take on the referendum			1
' she insisted reports that the chancellor would reject any deal that would allow @entity106 to leave the @entity26 and keep the pound were a ' cack - handed , panicky campaign manoeuvre ' ahead of that historic vote			0
@entity265 , chief executive of the pro-independence @entity106 campaign , told @entity269 @entity4 's @entity268 programme that the ' best currency choice for an independent @entity106 is to be in a currency union with the rest of the @entity26 '			1
deputy first minister @entity244 he said ruling that out before the referendum was a ' very extreme position being taken for the purposes of negotiation ' by the @entity280 parties			0
mr @entity265 insisted : ' it would be so clearly to the detriment of the rest of the @entity26 to impose the additional costs , currency transactions , currency conversion , to threaten growth , to threaten jobs in that way			0
' to go against what we know is the wishes of the majority of people in @entity294 , that @entity4 should continue to use the pound after we vote yes in september , would be ludicrous			0
' however @entity10 former @entity4 secretary @entity296 told the same programme that ruling out a currency union was ' the logical extension of the debate over the last year '			1
he added : ' we 've got a very effective monetary union at the moment as part of a political and fiscal union , and it works very well across the @entity26			0
there are challenges in the economy , but together we have greater resilience and greater opportunities than if we go apart			0

@entity31 rules out currency union with an independent @entity106
