it 's that time of year when everyone vows to get fit and fight the flab to become fitter and healthier			1
but after the initial early january enthusiasm , many people will struggle to keep up with their proposed fitness regime			1
some will complain that they just do n't have time to fit the exercise in , while others will do too much too soon and get injured or give up because it 's too tough			1
and she has an all body workout , which you can view and follow in the video below , which will tone you up and burn fat with the added bonus that it can be completed in less than 15 minutes			1
she told @entity31 : ' at this time of year a lot of people are looking to shed fat and sculpt , strong lean bodies - for those aims , a healthy diet is key , of course , but on the exercise side , high intensity workouts are the ticket			1
jumping jacks : another move for raising the heart rate and burning calories @entity45 : push the feet out behind you , left , and then jump up into the air , right ' @entity50 , more intense workouts challenge our body by making it do things it is n't used to			1
you 're not simply doing more of the same activity just for a bit longer , you 're really pushing your body to places it has n't been before			1
' the workout in the video , taken from @entity16 's book @entity65 , contains just six moves that are all you need to shape up			2
@entity16 demonstrates three ways in which you can do the moves depending on your current fitness - so if it does n't hurt , you need to move on to the next level			1
one circuit of the exercises , as described below , should be done with 30 seconds of doing the move repeatedly followed by a 30 second rest			0
then repeat the circuit again ( or do the more advanced version if you found the beginners ' moves too easy )			0
way to a flat stomach : hold the plank position for 30 seconds the six exercises are as follows : @entity85 30 seconds push ups 30 seconds steam engines 30 seconds jumping jacks 30 seconds plank 30 seconds burpees 30 seconds step ups do all the moves continuously with 30 seconds recovery in between then repeat the circuit beginners , start on knees , advanced with feet propped up on a bench or chair @entity16 explains : ' press ups are an awesome all - body move , again you 're bracing the core and engaging the abdominal muscles to maintain a straight position , which is great for shredding the belly and at the same time you 're sculpting the chest and arms			1
' to do it , start lying flat face down , position your palms face down under your shoulders and then push up so your body is balanced on your hands and toes and your back is straight			0
steam engines start in a standing position then raise one knee to opposite elbow and repeat on the other side			1
move with more speed if you are fitter			0
this move will raise your heart rate while toning the stomach , bottom and legs			0
the plank this move engages your core muscles leading to a tighter , flatter stomach			0
@entity16 explains : ' the plank is one of the best exercises for tightening the tummy because it works the whole midsection of your body , including the deep abdominal muscles			0
it is also great for improving posture and balance and will build core strength to help you perform better many other exercises			0
' begin by lying flat face down			0
position your arms under your shoulders and then rise up onto your hands or your body is balanced on your hands and toes and your back is straight			0
jumping jacks from standing , do a star jump splitting your legs apart and then jumping back to bring them together			1
at the same time , raise your arms up and apart			1
beginners can do the move more slowly			0
this exercise again raises the heart rate burning calories			0
@entity45 burpees are renowned as one of the toughest exercises around - which means they must do you good			1
from standing , lower yourself onto your hands and then push your feet out and back in , then leap up into the air			0
beginners should do the move more slowly or could put one foot back instead of both			0
the moves works up a sweat as well as toning the stomach , arms and legs so is one of the best all body exercises you can do			0
@entity186 if you do n't have an exercise step , use a stair or just mimic the action by raising your knees up and down			1
as the name suggests , the move involves stepping up and down leading with each leg alternatively			1
step up : use a stair if you do n't have the equipment @entity16 said if people follow this workout , which takes less than 15 minutes , twice a week , ' you 'd get fitter and possibly notice some subtle changes in your body shape after just a few weeks			1
' she added : ' obviously , if you did a workout every day , those results would be more dramatic			0
but over time , those results would almost certainly plateau and you 'd need to up the ante by doing longer and / or more intense sessions			1
' one thing is for sure , doing 15 minute workouts is a million times better than not exercising at all			2
' to stay motivated , @entity16 recommends setting yourself a goal and then sharing it with other people so you become accountable to follow it through			2
she also recommends seeking support from like - minded people online			1
while @entity16 's workout can be done at home , there are also short exercises you can do while getting some fresh air that will also take little time but will improve your fitness			1
@entity227 , 49 , head trainer at @entity228 , said it 's easy to get fit in just 15 minutes if you are using the time to working the muscles and raise the heart rate			1
time to get fit : a running session known fartlek ( aka speed play ) can take just 15 minutes he said : ' if you combine these things with good nutrition it will lead to a fitter , healthier , happier life			1
' @entity227 recommends the short sessions below to tone up and burn calories			1
he explains : all of these sessions can be done by any level or standard			2
it is about individual work rate during each session			0
just do what you can and do it as best as you can			0
' they can be adapted to any level , made longer or shorter and you can change the exercises to train different parts of the body			0
' depending on your individual work rate you could burn 20 - 30 calories every minute , so the harder you work , the more you burn			1
' session one : @entity261 â€“ 15 mins this session can be done anywhere and for as long as you wish			2
first , warm up with a steady jog for three minutes			2
then alternate 30 seconds at a fast jog , followed by 30 seconds sprinting then 30 seconds walking			0
to warm down either steady jog or walk for three minutes			2
session two : cardio - 15 minutes this is a @entity271 ( @entity271 ) with five exercises that will condition the whole body			1
start on the minute and complete every exercise as quickly as you can			0
warm up for three minutes with a gentle jog and warm down by stretching for two minutes at the end of this session			2
the time you have left remaining before the next minute starts again is your rest time			2
if you feel you are not getting enough rest then just cut back on the reps until you feel your fitness improving			2
despite their best intentions , many people may take up running this @entity287 and give up by mid-january due to lack of motivation and support			2
but @entity290 , a new running challenge kicking off on january 5 , may be the secret to staying on track			2
it 's an online challenge that 's open to everyone of all abilities , with a range of goals			0
participants set their own personal activity targets for their fitness , health or performance goals and strive to stick them during january , february and march			2
