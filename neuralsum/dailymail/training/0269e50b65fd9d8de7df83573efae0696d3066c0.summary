a fascinating interactive map from security firm norse serves as a stark reminder to just how dangerous the web can be			1
the live graphic plots every attack taking place on the internet , in real - time and reveals the number of attacks , where the attacks originate , and which locations they are aimed at			1
and the map highlights the staggering number of attacks that take place between the @entity17 and @entity18 - who are said to be locked in a cyper - spying war			1
norse 's interactive live map , shown above , allows viewers to watch as live attacks unfold around the world			1
the most popular target seems to be the @entity17 , with many attacks originating in @entity18			1
at certain times , a large attack will take place when hackers try to take a website offline , known as a @entity34 attack			0
the map was designed to work in @entity36 and loading times may vary depending on your browser to gather the data , @entity22 uses a worldwide ' honeypot ' , which is , essentially , a vulnerable network purposefully set up to knows when it is being attacked			2
@entity34 stands for ' distributed denial - of - service ' attack , when hackers use a network of ' zombie ' computers to sabotage a specific web site or server			0
the idea is pretty simple - a hacker tells all the computers on his botnet to contact a specific server or web site repeatedly			0
the sudden increase in traffic can cause the site to load very slowly for legitimate users			0
sometimes the traffic is enough to shut the site down completely			0
this lets the company tell when and where an attack is originating from , creating a live map around the world			2
it also lets the company detect when a huge attack is taking place , perhaps to take down a website or render a service inoperable			2
‘ every second , @entity22 collects and analyses live threat intelligence from darknets in hundreds of locations in over 40 countries , ’ the company wrote			1
a darknet being a private network			0
‘ the attacks shown are based on a small subset of live flows against the @entity22 honeypot infrastructure , representing actual worldwide cyber attacks by bad actors			1
‘ at a glance , one can see which countries are aggressors or targets at the moment			0
’ to gather the data norse uses a worldwide honeypot , in essence a purposefully vulnerable network that knows when it is being attacked			0
this lets the company tell when and where an attack is originating from , creating this live map from around the world the @entity17 @entity102 announced it was subjected to 10 million cyber attacks a day in 2012			1
while the @entity106 , in charge of @entity17 ’s nuclear stockpile , also saw 10 million attacks per day in 2013 , while the @entity109 in total reported 120,000 daily attacks in 2011			2
earlier this month , a security report by security firm @entity112 found that cybercrime is now such big business , it is worth more than the wealth of some countries			0
as a business , cybercrime would be ranked 27th in the world based on revenue , and the attacks are currently costing the world more than £ 238 billion ( $ 400 billion ) a year			1
this is equal to more than 0.5 per cent of the world ’s total gross domestic product , damaging the global economy almost as much as illegal drugs and piracy , according to ‘ the @entity131 ’ report			2
@entity132 experienced an outage on 19 april that meant users were unable to log on for 30 minutes ( pictured )			2
during this time , @entity137 user @entity135 used @entity22 's map to spot a significant distributed denial - of - service ( @entity34 ) attack originating in @entity18 , and appearing to attack the @entity17 @entity132 said the downtime was due to ' an issue that prevented people from posting to @entity132 for a brief period of time ' and did not confirm or deny if it had been hit by an attack security experts , including from @entity150 law enforcement agency @entity149 and @entity151 , have been discussing the report , and what more needs to be done to stop the increasing amount of web attacks			1
the report also found that more than 200,000 jobs have been lost as a result of cybercrime - through reputation damage or loss of assets			0
when @entity132 was down for 30 minutes last week , @entity137 user @entity135 used @entity22 's map to spot a significant distributed denial - of - service ( @entity34 ) attack originating in @entity18 , and appearing to attack the @entity17 @entity132 said at the time the downtime was due to ' an issue that prevented people from posting to @entity132 for a brief period of time ' and did not confirm or deny if it had been hit by an attack			1
this type of attack consists of using bots to overload a website with requests and take it offline			0
hackers have used them to take down other famous websites in the past , including @entity179 and @entity180			0
meanwhile , back in april @entity181 , headquartered in @entity182 , launched its own cyberthreat map			2
using @entity181 's interactive map users can rotate the globe and zoom in to any part of the world to get a closer look at the local threat landscape			1
different types of threats detected in real - time are marked with different colours			2
click on the image to be taken to the full interactive map it similarly visualises cyber security incidents occurring worldwide in real time			1
the types of threats displayed include malicious objects detected during on - access and on - demand scans , email and web antivirus detections , as well as objects identified by vulnerability and intrusion detection sub-systems			0
' every day @entity181 handles more than 300,000 malicious objects , ' said @entity210 , @entity211 at @entity212 ' three years ago the figure was just 70,000 but antivirus technologies have also changed with the times and we have no problem coping with this huge stream of traffic			0
' where do the attacks come from ? where do users click on malicious links most often ? which types of malware are the most prevalent ? these are the sort of questions being asked by lots of users			0
' our new map of the cyberworld threat landscape allows everyone to see the scale of cyber activity in real time and to get a taste of what it feels like to be one of our experts			1

@entity244 - based company @entity22 has released a live interactive *cyber-threat* map showing attacks on the internet
it can be used to see which countries are being targeted , and which are initiating attacks , in real time
@entity255 reveals a seemingly *ongoing* *tussle* between @entity17 and @entity18 with numerous attacks travelling back and forth
and a video using the live interactive map last week claims to show that @entity18 caused @entity132 's 30 - minute outage
millions of cyber attacks take place every day globally - and it costs the world economy £ 238 billion ( $ 400 billion )
