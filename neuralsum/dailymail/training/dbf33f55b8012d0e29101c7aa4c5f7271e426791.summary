the 18inch long reptile was spotted under a seat on a flight which had arrived from @entity8 in @entity9			1
the juvenile @entity11 smooth - scaled racer was found on the plane at @entity13 on tuesday , echoing 2006 film snakes on a plane			2
stowaway : @entity17 , believed to be a juvenile @entity11 smooth - scaled racer , was found on the plane at @entity13 it is unclear if the reptile slithered onto the plane itself or if it escaped from someone ’s hand luggage			1
staff from the @entity27 were called and used a box to contain the snake			2
the snake was taken to the charity ’s animal rescue centre in @entity33 , @entity13 , where staff have named it @entity35 for sneak			1
@entity38 senior inspector @entity37 said : ' we have had the snake examined by a vet and , although we ca n’t be 100 per cent certain , we believe he is of the @entity43 family , which are commonly referred to as @entity11 smooth - scaled racers			0
' @entity46 are n’t venomous but , like all snakes , they can bite and @entity17 is very feisty			2
although small at the moment , he is still a juvenile and has a lot of growing to do			0
' venomous : a still from ' @entity51 ' , featuring @entity52 ( left )			1
the film centered on an outbreak of poisonous reptiles on a flight , with lethal consequences ( right ) inspector @entity37 said staff at @entity13 had ' remained remarkably calm ' after finding the snake			1
he said : ' i can only imagine that @entity17 managed to sneak his way onto the plane while it was waiting to take off in @entity8 , although it is also possible he has hitched a lift in someone ’s hand luggage			0
' we have rescued several exotic creatures from international flights including scorpions , spiders , turtles and even giant land snails , so this is n’t as unusual as many people might think			0
' @entity17 will remain in our care until we can find him an expert home with someone who has the necessary experience and knowledge to be able to look after such a creature			0
' the discovery of @entity17 brings to mind the 2006 action movie snakes on a plane , in which an @entity85 , played by @entity52 , has to contend with a plane full of venomous snakes			1

in an interview with @entity99 , @entity52 said he heard about the movie he called the director , @entity101 , and said , ' you doing a movie about snakes on a plane ? ' ' yeah '			2
' a plane full of poisonous snakes ? ' ' yeah '			0
