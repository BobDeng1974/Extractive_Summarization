by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:00 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 20:00 est , 26 september 2013 unconvinced : @entity2 said mr @entity4 ’s policy could cost consumers more in the long run @entity8 @entity7 have challenged @entity9 to bring down energy bills by cutting green taxes			1
helping smaller firms to compete with the dominant @entity14 would also lower prices , they added			0
this week @entity4 pledged to freeze energy bills for two years if @entity16 wins the next election			1
the proposal has been savaged by power firms , which saw another £ 800million wiped from their values yesterday			1
@entity2 , a @entity8 member of the @entity22 and @entity21 , said mr @entity4 ’s policy could cost consumers more in the long run			1
controlling bills without controlling wholesale and distribution costs would leave energy firms vulnerable to price spikes for gas and oil , he warned			2
this could result in them requiring bail - outs			0
‘ this is what happened in the 1970s , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity38 and @entity39 , nationalised industries , made a loss and the government had to cover it – so the consumer still picks up the tab			0
’ his committee colleague @entity45 , a former @entity8 cabinet minister , said ministers were ‘ aggravating ’ the burden of soaring bills with levies to promote the use of renewable energy			1
green taxes currently account for about 10 per cent of the average electricity bill			1
under government projections this will rise to 33 per cent by 2020			0
not impressed : @entity45 ( left ) said ministers were ‘ aggravating ’ the burden of soaring bills			0
@entity57 ( right ) said such green levies ' put @entity59 on a crash programme of carbon reduction which is very costly ' ‘ the only thing that the government directly controls in terms of energy bills are the additional costs imposed through unjustifiable green energy taxes , ’ mr @entity45 said			1
‘ governments are responsible for all those costs , and yet they pretend price rises are because energy firms are raising profits			0
' we need to abandon these attempts to replace carbon with sources of energy which are twice as expensive , and we need to do more to encourage competition			0
’ price freeze : @entity4 introduced the policy in his flagship speech to the @entity84 conference earlier this week @entity57 , @entity8 chairman of the treasury select committee , said such green levies - introduced as a result of the @entity21 , passed when mr @entity4 was energy secretary in 2008 - ‘ put @entity59 on a crash programme of carbon reduction which is very costly			1
’ he said the legislation , passed with overwhelming cross-party support , was ‘ a profound mistake ’			0
meanwhile , former @entity8 leadership candidate @entity93 and @entity94 both called for the government to invest in a new generation of nuclear power stations			2
this would increase electricity bills but lead to more homegrown energy , securing @entity59 ’s power supplies			2
mr @entity94 admitted that green subsidies ‘ inflate bills ’ , but said encouraging competition with initiatives such as group - switching - when large numbers of customers band together to change suppliers - would ‘ bring bills down , reduce carbon emissions and strengthen consumer clout against the energy giants ’			1
energy firms are currently trying to raise private sector funding for £ 110billion of new infrastructure and nuclear power stations , which they say could be jeopardised by mr @entity4 ’s price freeze			1
when asked about the @entity122 ’s speech , @entity120 said only that it was ‘ excellently delivered ’ , pointedly refusing to comment on its content			0
@entity59 's biggest power companies saw a further £ 800million wiped from their value yesterday in a second day of turmoil			1
shares in @entity131 owner @entity131 and @entity133 were punished again in a relentless investor backlash over @entity4 ’s election vow to freeze power prices			1
the two companies , which between them supply 21million homes across @entity59 , have now seen a staggering £ 2.8billion stripped from their value in the past 48 hours			0
in the day following the @entity122 ’s pledge , which the industry says will increase the likelihood of power cuts , the stock market values of both groups plunged by £ 2billion			2
more than a million small shareholders will have seen their holdings hammered by the fall			0
‘ unfortunately we see this saga dragging on , with impracticality of the proposals juxtaposed against their populist nature , ’ said respected energy analyst @entity149 at @entity150			0
another analyst @entity155 , at @entity156 , warned of ‘ a potentially open - ended loss during the price freeze ’			0
former business secretary @entity159 went further , suggesting mr @entity4 had taken the party backwards			2
‘ at the @entity161 i tried to move on from the conventional choice in industrial policy between state control and laissez - faire , ’ he said			0
@entity159 , one of the architects of @entity16 and its pro-business agenda , came under attack himself from the shadow energy secretary , @entity169 , who called him ‘ plain wrong ’			1
she accused the peer of looking after his own financial interests ; he is a director of @entity175 conglomerate @entity174 , which operates in the oil industry , and earns a reported £ 200,000 a year , plus a share of profits			0
‘ @entity159 may not have to worry about his energy bills , but a lot of consumers and businesses do , ’ she said			1
three of the @entity14 – npower , @entity185 and @entity186 – already give customers the chance to fix their own bills until 2017 , with npower advertising the offer online with the tagline : ‘ why wait for @entity4 ? ’ under the deals , customers pay above - average bills now , in the hope that price rises will eventually outstrip their premium			2
power firms claim that if the government paid the green taxes instead of consumers , everyone would save money			1
@entity7 say that while this would take the heat off energy firms , it would hit consumers just as hard as the money would have to be raised with other taxes .			2

@entity8 *mps* challenge @entity159 to bring down energy bills by cutting green taxes
@entity4 will freeze energy bills for 2 years if @entity16 wins next election
angry power firms saw another £ 800m wiped from their values yesterday
