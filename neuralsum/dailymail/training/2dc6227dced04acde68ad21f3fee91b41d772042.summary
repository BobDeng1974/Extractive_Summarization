by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 3:06 pm on 23rd november 2011 when @entity2 boarded the 218 bus to got go home with her 15 - month - old daughter , she expected a bit of sympathy when she did n’t have the 20p the driver asked for			1
instead , the 26 - year - old was met with a confrontation and after getting off the bus in @entity13 , @entity14 , the driver ‘ flipped the bird ’ at her			2
fortunately for @entity16 worker mrs @entity2 , she had her camera ready and managed to get a picture of the driver and his offensive gesture			1
the driver of the bus objected to having his picture taken and can be seen reacting by sticking his middle finger up she tried to pay a £ 2.20 fare with a £ 10 note for the one - and - a - half mile journey from @entity27 to the stop near her house			1
she was asked for the 20p , but when she said she did n’t have any change on her , mrs @entity2 and her daughter , @entity31 , were ordered off the bus			1
fortunately , a valiant passenger came to her rescue when he saw how embarrassed she became over the exchange and offered her a 20p piece			2
mrs @entity2 completed the journey , but hostilities continued and with the driver refusing to give his name , she took a photograph instead so that she could file a complaint			1
mrs @entity2 with the receipt following the argument with the driver she said : ‘ i was so upset and shocked			1
i was with my little girl at the time			2
i think the way he treated me was just not right			0
‘ he asked if i had 20p and i said “ sorry that ’s all i have ”			0
he said “ you have to get off the bus ”			0
‘ i was so embarrassed			0
all the passengers were looking at me and shook their heads			2
‘ one man asked me how much i needed and he gave me the 20p			0
’ it was only when she returned home on november 11 and looked at the picture , that she realised in the process of having his face photographed , the @entity61 driver had stuck his middle finger up at her			1
‘ as i was getting off the bus i had my phone camera ready to take a photo			0
i took a picture of his face			0
‘ i did n’t realise at first he gave me the middle finger because of the light shining on the window			0
’ she added : ‘ i do n’t think he should treat other people like that			0
i ’m still in shock			0
’ mrs @entity2 conceded that the exchange of words became ‘ heated ’ but added : ‘ he did n’t have to be rude to me over 20p			2
it ’s just not right			0
’ an @entity61 spokesman said : ' we have investigated mrs @entity2 ’ complaint and this investigation has included interviewing our driver and checking the digital cctv images recorded on the journey in question			1
' we can not condone the driver ’s action and he has been suitably disciplined			2
' he is a long - serving employee with a good record and he is extremely sorry that he acted in the way he did but he is adamant that he did not swear at mrs @entity2 and did ensure that she got to her destination			1
' however , he did experience considerable verbal abuse from mrs @entity2 which has been verified by an independent witness and can be seen on the @entity102 footage which also shows her arguing with other passengers			1

@entity105 refused to accept @entity2 ' £ 10 note
@entity61 says woman became abusive to driver and other passengers
he let her off at her end destination and driver has *apologised* for his actions
