so when the model , her husband @entity12 and their 10 - month - old son @entity13 landed in @entity16 from @entity17 earlier this month , the last thing they expected to hear was that one of their two dogs did n't make it			1
' we drove to the dark cargo terminal and on arrival in the hangar were told simply , “ one of them is dead ” by the emotionless worker who seemed more interested in his text messages , ' @entity3 wrote in a heated web post on thursday titled : ' @entity31 killed our golden retriever			2

after a six - hour drive to @entity17 to avoid a connecting flight that could potentially stress or separate their dogs , she says she paid the airline $ 1,800 in addition to their plane tickets to ensure their pets ' safety as passengers			1
however , it seems that the airline failed to keep its promises about the dogs			2
