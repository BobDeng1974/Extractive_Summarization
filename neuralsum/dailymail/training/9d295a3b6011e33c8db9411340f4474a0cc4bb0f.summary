standing in the cold night air at @entity2 , @entity0 could have been forgiven for thinking about the grander stages he has graced in his career			1
the former @entity7 and @entity8 star ’s mind could have wandered to the lucrative offers he turned down to finish his career abroad last summer instead of taking a pay cut to join @entity11 on a free transfer from @entity13			1
but after scoring on his first @entity16 start for @entity11 in a typically full - blooded @entity19 encounter , there was nowhere @entity0 would rather have been than @entity20			1
@entity0 wheels away after scoring his first goal for @entity11 to put them ahead at @entity20 @entity0 's strike was his first since december 2013 , and came on his first start for @entity11 in the league ‘ this is what it ’s all about , playing in the @entity16 , ’ he said			1
‘ i could have gone and filled my pockets , and that ’s not a criticism of the players who do that because it ’s a short career and we ’re not really qualified to do anything else after football			2
‘ i ’ve been lucky enough and the fire still burns for me			0
i just want to play			2
i prefer to be in @entity2 at @entity20 than playing in the @entity40 somewhere in 100 degrees			1
you know what i mean ? it ’s a proper game			0
‘ you have to respect the little kid who just dreamed of playing one minute in the @entity16			0
if you keep that in mind , you can keep playing for as long as you want			0
’ @entity0 has revealed that he turned down the opportunity to play for more money outside of @entity8 this summer the former @entity8 midfielder is mobbed by his team - mates as @entity11 took the lead on saturday @entity0 knows his days at the top of the game , when he was an @entity8 regular , are behind him at 33 , the one - time prodigy of @entity19 football knows his best years are behind him			1
even playing a full game might be asking too much these days			0
but @entity0 was excellent for the 67 minutes he was on the pitch , showing some of his old movement and anticipation to fire @entity11 ahead just before half - time and silence any doubters who question if he still has anything to offer at this level			1
‘ you deal with things like that , ’ he added			0
‘ once you get past 30 nowadays , people tend to question you			0
‘ they always have opinions			0
have you got it , have you not got it ? are you going to be good enough to play for @entity13 , for @entity7 or for @entity8 ? would i be able to go and play in @entity70 ( with @entity71 ) ? ‘ it ’s just how you feel in yourself			1
i ’m hungry to play , i ’ve got the desire			2
while that ’s still there , i ’ll have a go			0
’ @entity78 ' late penalty denied @entity11 all three points , and @entity2 almost snatched a late winner @entity0 ’s first goal since last december was not enough to prevent @entity11 ’s winless run from stretching to nine games after @entity78 equalised with a late penalty for @entity2 and then hit the post in added time			1
that was the cue for a section of @entity11 ’s fans to turn on manager @entity90 who 24 hours earlier had confirmed the shock departure of his no. 2 @entity92			2
first - team coach @entity93 sat alongside @entity90 on the bench on saturday , and afterwards the @entity11 boss said that he will ‘ mull it over for a few weeks ’ before appointing a new assistant			1
@entity90 ’s side are away again on tuesday night at @entity98 while @entity2 have another home game against @entity100 after picking up seven points from their last three games			2
‘ momentum is a big factor , ’ said goalkeeper @entity103			0
‘ it shows how far we ’ve come from the start of the season that we were a goal down in the @entity16 and were disappointed not to have won			2
we ’ll take a point and move forward			0

@entity0 scored his first goal for @entity11 in draw with @entity2
the 33 - year - old still *determined* to play at the *highest* level
@entity0 was offered chance to play abroad , but wanted to stay in @entity8
