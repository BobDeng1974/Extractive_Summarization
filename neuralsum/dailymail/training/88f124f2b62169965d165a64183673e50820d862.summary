underneath his autograph the @entity22 monster wrote the date of march 5 , 1945			2

file copy of @entity1 ( right ) ' @entity2 , in retreat in his bunker in @entity86 could only await the inevitable total destruction of his @entity22			1
' but it is also well known that he believed that via some miracle some sort of surprise counter attack by the @entity44 army would turn the tide in his favour			0
' so on march 5 he presented this book , signing it with his bizarre signature			2
' we do n't know to whom he gave the book , but it was probably a senior member of his staff , and it is quite possible that it was given as a parting gift			0
' the signature is also significant as it shows how much his mental state had degenerated and he must have known his inevitable fate			2
' his signature , once large and bold , had degenerated into a small almost insignificant scribble			0
