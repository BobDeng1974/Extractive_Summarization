a bodybuilder who suffers from a crippling bowel disease has defied by winning his first fitness competition - while wearing his colostomy bag			1
@entity4 , 33 , beat hundreds of hopefuls to be crowned the champion of a national male fitness modelling competition			1
he had been left devastated when he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2003 , just as he was preparing to compete - and his condition forced him to quit			1
medics said his bowel condition would make becoming a fitness model impossible mr @entity4 beat hundreds of other men to win the title , as judges compared his impressive physique to a photo taken just after he left hospital			1
he posed in nothing but a pair of trunks with his stoma bag visible , saying he wanted to show people with a stoma bag that anything is possible mr @entity4 said it took him a while to build his confidence back up , and to talk openly about having a stoma over the next decade , he was treated with a variety of different drugs to keep the chronic bowel disease under control			1
he was forced to stop his strict training regime - which had included two - hour gym sessions six days a week - and lost two stone in weight as his muscle wasted away			2
he thought he would have to give up his dream of entering fitness competitions because his condition meant he was unable to keep his sculpted body in shape			1
he lived with the debilitating disease for 10 years until a flare up at the end of 2012 left him constantly fatigued and needing to go to the toilet 20 times a day			1
by last october , his health had deteriorated so much that he required surgery			2
the father - of - one was admitted to the @entity60 in @entity61 for a sub-total colectomy , meaning his entire colon was removed			1
doctors then performed an ileostomy , where the small intestine was diverted through an opening in the abdomen			0
mr @entity4 - who also needed a further two operations to help him digest food - was then left with a stoma bag on the outside of his body			1
he was discharged from hospital at the end of november and told by doctors that he would never be able to train at the level needed to be a fitness model			1
ulcerative colitis left mr @entity4 tired all the time and needing to go to the toilet 20 times a day ( pictured left )			1
eventually he was admitted for surgery to remove his entire colon ( pictured right ) doctors warned the father - of - one after surgery that he would never be able to train at the level required to be a fitness model - but he decided to try anyway @entity89 ( @entity89 ) is a condition that causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the rectum and colon ( the large bowel )			1
in @entity89 , tiny ulcers develop on the surface of the lining and these may bleed and produce pus			0
the inflamed colon is less able to absorb liquid and this can lead to a larger volume of watery stools			0
also , because the colon can not hold as much as usual , sufferers may have very frequent bowel movements ( six or more a day )			0
it â€™s estimated that @entity89 affects about one in every 420 people in the @entity112			0
viruses , bacteria , diet and stress have all been suggested as environmental triggers , but there is no definite evidence that any one of these factors is the cause of @entity89			0
@entity123 , mr @entity4 - who weighed 11st 12lbs when he left hospital - started going to the gym in january this year and slowly increased his training schedule			1
in july , @entity126 reported he had managed to relaunch his career as a fitness model against the odds , and become a personal trainer			1
less than a year after his surgery , he has now beaten off hundreds of other men to be crowned the champion of a male fitness modelling competition			1
mr @entity4 came first in the male transformation category at the @entity13 event at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , on november 2			2
he posed in nothing but a pair of trunks with his stoma bag visible as judges compared his impressive physique to a photo taken just after he left hospital			2
incredibly , he was also placed in the other two categories he entered by coming 4th out of 20 in ' tattooed muscle model ' and 5th out of 40 in ' fitness model under 75kg '			1
yesterday , mr @entity4 said he hoped his success in his first ever modelling competition would inspire others with serious health problems			2
the personal trainer , who lives with his partner in @entity154 , @entity155 , said : ' it was my first ever competition			1
' i was just starting to get into it over 10 years ago when i was struck down by the ulcerative colitis			2
' it was absolutely amazing to be able to go to a competition and compete against and beat people that have n't had to go through what i have gone through			0
' i am determined to show people and society that having a stoma does n't change who you are ... you can be attractive , and you can lead a normal life ' he said ' i placed in all three categories that i went in , it was really rewarding bearing in mind it was 12 months since i had my last surgery			2
' there is two ways you can react to a major health problem			0
you can either think it 's game over or you can do what i did and say i think i can do it and give it your best shot			0
' i just want to inspire others and i get so many messages from people who have had surgery saying they want to get back into their football or other sports which is great			2
' mr @entity4 was warned by doctors to give up his dream of becoming a fitness model after having the stoma bag fitted last year			1
but incredibly , after leaving hospital weighing just 11st 12lbs , he has now bulked up to 13st and has appeared in ' @entity198 ' and ' @entity200 ' magazines			0
mr @entity4 , who has a son @entity201 , 12 , now plans to give his body a rest before entering another @entity13 event and the @entity206 competition in the @entity112 next april			2
he added : ' when i came out of hospital it was the first time i had in weeks to get used to having a stoma			0
mr @entity4 achieved his sculpted body less than 12 months after having surgery to remove his colon ' it took a while to build my confidence again , to talk to people openly about having a stoma , to show anyone what i had			1
' but over time i realised that this is me and the operation made me feel like a new person , my energy levels were much better and i could enjoy life more			0
' i asked the doctors if i would be able to train and they said there was a risk of hernias and other problems			0
' they said to start lifting weights and training to be a physique model would be very unattainable and unlikely			0
' but i just thought i am going to go in there and train and see what happens			0
you know you 're own body and i just found myself being able to handle it			0
' i did my first photo - shoot at the end of april and after that people began asking more about the bag and i was able to talk about it			0
' i am determined to show people and society that having a stoma does n't change who you are			0
' it does n't mean you 're not normal			0
it means you can achieve anything you want to do , you can be attractive , and you can lead a normal life			0
