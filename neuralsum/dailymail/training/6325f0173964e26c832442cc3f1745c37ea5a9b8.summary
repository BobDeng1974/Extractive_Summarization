@entity1 troops stationed on the @entity3 border ca n't arrest illegal immigrants , but @entity3 gov. @entity5 says the deterrent factor makes sending the troops there worthwhile			1
' it 's a powerful reminder that what you are doing is a crime , ' @entity5 told an online news outlet run by the conservative @entity14			2
' it 's just like a law enforcement effort in your neighborhood , where you see a parked patrol police car on the corner , and the bad guys see it and do n’t commit a crime			0
' their real job is not apprehension , ' @entity5 said			2
' but many of those federal agents have been re-tasked in recent months to glorified babysitting duties , caring for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors flooding the border			0
public outcry , especially among @entity3 ranchers and tea party groups , drove @entity5 to deploy the @entity1			1
he said tuesday that @entity28 @entity27 agents will be grateful for the help			0
' they are n’t displacing @entity27 , ' @entity5 said of the @entity1 troops , who will number as many as 1,000			1
' it 'll be just like how we partner with law enforcement			0
they want to see the border secure , so they wo n’t resist the assistance			0
just the presence and knowledge that they ’re deployed will have a powerful message			0
' the @entity1 will mostly work alongside state law - enforcement officers deployed at the border by @entity5 earlier this month			1
' for those who say , " this is very out of the ordinary , " the @entity1 being at the border is not an unusual situation , ' he added			2
' there ’s troops at the border every year and there ’s troops there now			0
' president @entity79 ordered @entity1 units to patrol @entity28 's southwest border in 2006			1
president @entity82 extended that order in 2010			1
but his 2012 executive order of a virtual amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants brought to the @entity28 as children before 2007 has led to a wave of @entity90 children and teens seeking the same treatment			1
with that development , existing border security measures have proven inadequate			2
flood : hundreds of children and teens from @entity90 countries pour across the border daily and turn themselves in to federal agents , hoping for a ' permiso ' document that will allow them to stay pending an immigration court hearing @entity82 visited @entity3 just weeks ago but decided not to visit the border region			1
@entity5 later said that during a private meeting , @entity82 conceded that he was unaware most @entity27 officers were stationed dozens of miles inside the @entity28 – not on the border itself			1
that arrangement has left them powerless to detain illegal immigrants until they are in the @entity28			1
@entity5 's deployment of @entity114 officers followed that meeting			0
' the responsibility for securing the border rests exclusively on the federal government , ' @entity5 wrote to that agency 's director on june 18			2
' the federal government 's failure to secure the border has created an incentive for families to send their children on a dangerous , and sometimes fatal , journey			0
' ' until the federal government fulfills its duty , ' @entity5 declared , ' it falls on the @entity131 to address those obligations			0

@entity3 governor deployed up to 1,000 @entity1 troops to the @entity28 - @entity3 border this month but did n't give them arrest powers
he *argues* that their deterrent factor alone is worth the exercise
troops will work alongside state police agencies @entity5 activated as a *supplement* to what he says are inadequate measures from @entity149
hundreds of children and teens pour across the border from @entity3 every day , following a 2012 amnesty *announcement* from president @entity82 that only *affects* illegal immigrants brought to @entity28 as children before 2007
