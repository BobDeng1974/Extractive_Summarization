the @entity0 is known for having the highest tidal range in the world			1
and a time - lapse video that captures the rise and fall of the ice - capped tide at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , shows the natural wonder in all its beauty			1
three fishing boats in the video appear to be beached as day breaks and the large sweeping shadow is replaced by sunlight			2
day breaks at @entity6 in @entity7 and the large sweeping shadow is replaced by sunlight suddenly the tide begins to rise in the distance and as water rushes through to the harbour the boats begin to rock on the surface of the bay			1
the surface remains frozen throughout the video , but a gap in the ice on the left shows water flooding onto the side of the bank as the level rises			2
before long the water has risen to be parallel with the harbour and the boats that were once grounded sit awkwardly on the top of the ice			0
as the tide begins to rise water rushes through to the harbour and the boats begin to rock on the surface two men can be seen shovelling snow from one of the boats as the water level begins to decrease once more			1
they leave for the day as nightfall approaches , and darkness soon cloaks the scene			0
the @entity0 , which has contested for world tidal dominance with the @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity8 , achieved the record for the highest water level ever at the head of @entity54 on the night of the ‘ @entity55 ’ on october 4 , 1869			1
in 1975 , the @entity56 declared that @entity57 , @entity7 has the highest tides in the world			0
the water rises to be parallel with the harbour and the boats that were once grounded sit awkwardly on top according to oceanographers , tidal resonance resulting from a coincidence of timing is the cause for the dramatic increase in water levels			0
however , traditional @entity72 folklore attributes the high tides in the @entity0 to a giant whale splashing in the water			2
tens of thousands of people flocked to beauty spots on the coasts of @entity8 , the @entity80 , @entity81 and the @entity82 over the weekend to catch a glimpse of the ‘ tide of the century ’			0
as nightfall approaches , darkness cloaks the scene and the water level begins to fall once more the @entity56 declared that @entity57 , @entity7 has the world 's highest tides it was the first giant tide of the millennium , with experts predicting that it could reach as high as 46ft in north - eastern @entity81			1
although it is dubbed the ‘ tide of the century ’ , the ‘ supertide ’ phenomenon occurs once every 18 years when a rare alignment of the sun , moon and @entity99 create a massive gravitational pull on the sea			0
the next ‘ tide of the century ’ will take place in march 2033 .			0

video captures the rise and fall of the ice - capped tide at @entity6
boats move up and down over the course of the day 's full tidal cycle
men are *featured* shovelling snow from one of the boats as the tide falls
