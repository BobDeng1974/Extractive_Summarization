by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 11:20 est , 16 july 2013 there 's nothing quite like mom 's cooking , and it would appear that one of the country 's biggest fast food chains agrees			2
last year , @entity8 unveiled its first new logo since 1983			0
the burger chain shelved the boxy old @entity12 lettering in favor of a sleeker , modern take on the @entity16 's icon coupled with breezy handwritten lettering			1
if you look carefully , the word ' mom ' can be found in @entity16 's collar			1
everything becomes clear : the word ' mom ' is really obvious when the new logo is seen in certain situations , such as this paper cup do you see it ? the new logo was unveiled in march of this year			1
it has proved to be a popular refresh , but some have claimed the word ' mom ' is written beneath @entity16 's collar old logo : on this logo from 1983 which was used until this year , @entity16 is seen to be wearing a collar			1
the company say the new logo is simply an update on the tried and tested brand the word becomes really obvious in single - color versions of the logo , which are used on @entity43 cups			0
the logo has been steadily rolled out for the last four months and some have noticed a subliminal message in the new logo			0
@entity16 's say that they did n't realize the hidden message within their logo			1
' we are aware of this and find it interesting that it appears our @entity16 cameo has ' mom ' on her ruffled collar			2
we can assure you it was unintentional , ' said a spokesperson from the company			0
one logo - blogging website believes there is more to the logo than the fast food chain is letting on and believe the company are playing off a simple fact that most of us love the taste of home			0
a closer look : when the logo is seen in monochrome , the word ' mom ' becomes very apparent a taste of home : @entity8 says it is not aware of the word ' mom ' in its new logo ... well , until now that is ! ' when growing up our brains learn to love what 's on the menu at home			2
most of us also associate home cooked meals with a safe and loving environment			0
most people have a sentimental attachment to at least a few of the dishes their @entity91 's used to make , ' write @entity92			0
' it should not be a surprise to see the fast food restaurant , @entity16 's associating their refreshed brand with @entity91 's cooking			1
this is something you may not notice consciously for years , but unconsciously it will leave an imprint on your brain and you will associate it with the brand			0
' @entity16 's say the new logo is being fanned out across its 6,000 @entity107 locations			1
restaurants that have already undergone the makeover have said they 're experiencing a 25 percent increase in sales .			2
