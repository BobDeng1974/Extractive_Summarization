staff had to be on their guard at @entity3 in @entity4 this morning when a snake came within inches of getting onto a plane			1

@entity18 - eyed passenger @entity17 , who rather fittingly works as the assistant minister for defence , was on hand to capture the action unfold			1
the snake was halted just inches from entering the main body of the plane by airport staff the snake 's actions were caught on camera by @entity4 's assistant defence minister @entity17 ( file photo ) ' the green snake had slithered up the front stairs so the passengers had to board from the back , ' he told @entity35			1
' it was probably enjoying the warmth of the tarmac and steel and may have made its way up there as people were boarding			0
' i took the photo just as the staff had got the little guy into a bag , so it was n't quite ' @entity48 ' and we did n't have an extra passenger to @entity12			2
' mp @entity17 was full of praise for the way the drama was handled by staff at @entity3			2
delays were minimal at @entity3 today after a snake was halted entering a plane on the tarmac ' the airport staff acted quickly and brought a bag with a rod to gather up the little guy and probably take him back to where he came from			0
' they responded well and the delay was minor			0
' it is not known as to what kind of snake it was			0
@entity69 were expected to return the reptile back to its natural habitat .			0
