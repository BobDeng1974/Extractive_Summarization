by @entity0 @entity1 of @entity2 , @entity3 , who had breast cancer in 2007 and had surgery to remove her left breast a gel rubbed onto the skin to shrink tumours could transform the treatment of breast cancer for thousands of women			1
the lotion , applied daily , contains the same active ingredient found in @entity16 pills , the most commonly used breast cancer drug in @entity18			1
research suggests the gel is as effective as the tablets at controlling the disease but , crucially , has fewer side - effects			1
in pill form , the drug causes nausea and hot flushes in half of women , while one in four will have extreme fatigue			0
more serious complications , such as blood clots that could cause a stroke and an increased risk of womb cancer , affect one in 100 patients on the drug			0
@entity16 works by blocking the effects of the hormone oestrogen			1
many types of breast cancer rely on this hormone to grow and have special receptors that oestrogen can lock onto			1
@entity16 sits on these receptors and gets in the hormone 's way , and is usually given after surgery to reduce the risk of a tumour coming back			2
many women stay on the drug for five years after their diagnosis			0
however , it 's estimated that up to half quit before then because they 're put off by the side - effects			1
these include former care worker @entity1 , 51 , who was diagnosed with breast cancer seven years ago			1
the mother of three had a mastectomy after the discovery of a hormone - sensitive tumour the size of a 50p piece			0
@entity1 was prescribed @entity16 to reduce her chances of the cancer returning and - as her sister had breast cancer at 42 and her mother had died of kidney cancer at 54 - she was happy to give it a go			1
she soon changed her mind			0
' as soon as i started taking it i began to feel sick all day , like morning sickness , ' says @entity1 who lives in @entity2 , @entity3 , with husband , @entity76 , 50 , a gas engineer			1
' i had no appetite and lost a stone in the first few weeks			0
' within two days i had severe hot flushes every couple of minutes , sweating so much people would say my face was streaming			0
i had to change my clothes eight or nine times a day			0
i felt embarrassed and did n't want to go out and socialise - and i was only 44			0
' she also became so sensitive to sunlight that her eyes hurt when she went outside and she had severe night sweats			0
' i had to sleep on a bath towel and get up and change it in the night as it would be soaked , ' says @entity1			2
she was offered treatment with the drug tamoxifen but found the drug side effects too troublesome ' even though i was flushed and sweaty , i also felt cold and shivery			1
the sweats disturbed my husband 's sleep as well as mine and i also felt self - conscious			0
' eventually , she tried sleeping pills , but still woke up in the night drenched in sweat			0
@entity1 had never been depressed before , but @entity16 made her tearful			1
she persevered for 50 days , hoping her body would adjust , but then decided enough was enough and came off the drug			0
' i know all the facts about @entity16 and how it can reduce your chances of breast cancer recurring , but for me the side - effects were too much to bear			1
' the impact on my quality of life was too high a price to pay			0
i would rather take my chances with breast cancer than live with @entity16 's side - effects			1
' a recent study by @entity114 found 400 lives and Â£ 30 million could be saved each year if women continued with @entity16			2
it 's hoped the gel will boost the numbers of women staying on the treatment , increasing their chances of long - term survival			2
it is likely to have fewer side - effects because while the pill has to be broken down by the liver and then circulated round the body , the gel is applied only to the area affected by the tumour			1
it seeps through the skin into the breast tissue			0
@entity16 has been the gold standard in breast cancer treatment for the past 20 years and is credited with playing a major part in a 30 per cent decline in the death toll from the disease			1
it 's not just given to those who have had breast cancer - it 's also recommended for those at high risk of developing the disease			1
last june , the @entity148 for @entity149 and @entity150 - recommended that the drug be given to any women over 35 whose family history gave them more than a 17 per cent risk of developing hormone sensitive breast cancer : 488,000 women in this country			1
there has been a hold - up in putting this recommendation into practice because the drug has not been licensed for women who have yet to develop breast cancer and so doctors are nervous of prescribing it			1
yet even if these women were offered the drug , the side - effects mean many may choose not to take it			1
given that so many women are reluctant to stick with the tablets , scientists at @entity172 , near @entity173 , wanted to see if a daily application of gel would be as good at stopping the return of cancer as pills , with fewer adverse effects			1
they recruited 26 women aged from 45 to 86 with ductal carcinoma in situ , or @entity184 , which accounts for one in four breast cancers			0
it 's a less serious form of the disease , as the cancer cells are inside the ducts of the breast and do not normally spread			2
half the women received the gel , which they applied every day , and half took the oral version of the drug			2
researchers took regular breast tissue samples to monitor levels of a protein , @entity197 - 67 , that is a marker for cancer cell growth			2
raised levels suggest cancer cells are multiplying			0
the results , published in the journal @entity208 last month , showed that after six to ten weeks , @entity197 - 67 levels had been reduced by similar amounts ( 50 to 60 per cent ) in gel and pill patients - suggesting the gel was just as good as the drug			2
@entity1 had never been depressed before , but @entity16 made her tearful but the amount of potentially toxic medicine circulating in patients ' bloodstreams was five times lower in those on the gel			1
researcher professor @entity221 said : ' the gel minimised exposure to the rest of the body and concentrated the drug in the breast where it is needed			2
' the gel reduced the risk of blood clots , but it did not reduce the incidence of hot flushes			0
however , researchers believe this is because the group was too small to give fully accurate results and they expect bigger studies would show a reduction in flushes			2
professor @entity241 says the gel may also be more effective for some women because one in three lack the right enzymes in the liver to properly metabolise oral @entity16			2
@entity247 science information officer dr @entity246 said : ' research looking at ways to make cancer treatment kinder is hugely important and this simple approach shows promise for this type of breast cancer			1
but the study only looked at a small number of women			0
' professor @entity258 , scientific director at the @entity260 prevention charity in @entity261 , said the study was interesting because it found a gel could reduce the risk of blood clots and was as effective as tablets in reducing cancer cell growth			2
however , he added : ' blood clot problems are rare with @entity16 , though , and hot flushes are a much more common side - effect			1
' researchers are in talks with the @entity271 in the @entity272 over plans to set up a much bigger trial - potentially involving hundreds of women			2
if this produces the same positive results , it 's possible the gel could become available within the next two to three years			0
it could make all the difference for women like @entity1 who , in the end , opted to have her ovaries removed to stop her from producing oestrogen			0
' the gynaecologist was sympathetic - he said my family history warranted it , ' she says			0
so , would she have been tempted to have tried the new gel instead ? ' it sounds as if it has a far less toxic effect than the @entity16 i was given and is just as effective at fighting cancer , ' says @entity1			1
' i definitely would have tried it if it had been available at the time			0

@entity1 , 51 , of @entity2 , @entity3 , had breast cancer in 2007
had surgery to remove her left breast and was offered @entity16
she found the side effects were too troublesome to put up with
studies show new gel version - without some of the effects - is just as good
potentially toxic medicine was five times lower in *participants* on the gel
