@entity6 won the contents of an abandoned storage container in @entity9 in november but opened it to find a foul stench inside
stashed inside a sealed ottoman , she found bags containing what appeared to be a small skull and hair
a coroner determined they were the remains of two babies or fetuses
investigations are *underway* to determine if the babies were alive when they were born - if so , murder charges could be *brought*
