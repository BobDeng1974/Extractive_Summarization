@entity1 president @entity0 will not visit @entity2 , the birthplace of his father , during his @entity5 tour when president @entity0 arrives in @entity5 this week , there will be one notable omission from his travel itinerary : @entity2 , the birthplace of his father and home to many of his relatives			1
concerns about @entity2 's political situation have trumped @entity0 's family ties			1
@entity2 's new president is facing charges of crimes against humanity in the @entity22 , accused of orchestrating the violence that marred the country 's 2007 election			1
ahead of @entity28 's victory earlier this year , a top @entity0 administration official warned @entity2 that their ' choices have consequences ' - a remark that now appears prescient given the president 's decision to skip a stop in his ancestral homeland			1
' the optics of that , of a presidential trip , are not what he wants to be demonstrating right now , ' said @entity41 , @entity5 director at the @entity42			0
the president will instead visit @entity44 , @entity5 and @entity45 , all countries that fit more neatly into the democracy and good governance message he 'll tout during his week - long trip			1
@entity0 , first lady @entity51 and daughters @entity52 and @entity54 are scheduled to depart @entity55 wednesday morning			0
the @entity56 did consider a visit to @entity2 when they contemplated an @entity59 swing during the president 's first term , before @entity28 's election			1
that trip never happened , but @entity0 pledged that he would , in fact , visit @entity2 before leaving office			2
' i 'm positive that before my service as president is completed i will visit @entity2 again , ' he said in a 2010 interview with @entity2 's state broadcaster			1
@entity56 officials say they respect the right of @entity2 to choose their own leaders			0
but deputy national security adviser @entity74 said the @entity1 also has ' a commitment to accountability and justice			0
' president @entity0 , first lady @entity51 and their daughters @entity52 and @entity54 ( pictured last week returning from a trip to @entity82 and @entity83 ) are due to leave for @entity5 on wednesday ' given the fact that @entity2 is in the aftermath of their election and the new government has come into place and is going to be reviewing these issues with the @entity22 and the international community , it just was n't the best time for the president to travel to @entity2 , ' @entity74 said			1
@entity2 's government has been muted in its response to the president 's decision to leave the county off his itinerary			1
' it 's for the @entity1 to decide where @entity0 goes , ' spokesman @entity101 said			0
' there are 54 nations on the @entity59 continent and he 's only visiting three , so i do n't see the real big deal about not going to @entity2			0
' but @entity109 , a political activist who lives in @entity110 , @entity111 's largest slum , said the @entity1 president was sending a message about @entity2 's political problems by putting democratic values ahead of his personal connections			2
' it would be a shame for an @entity1 president to come to @entity2 and shake dirty hands , ' @entity109 said			0
by now , @entity0 's ties with @entity2 are a well - known part of his unique family history			2
@entity124 was born in the western @entity2 village of @entity126 , moved to the @entity1 to study , and met and married the president 's mother in @entity129			2
he left the family soon after his son was born			0
return to his roots : @entity0 has not visited @entity2 since 2006 when he was a senator ( pictured ) @entity0 made his first trip to @entity2 in 1988 , after his father 's death , and wrote extensively about the visit in his memoir ' @entity133			1
' ' my name belonged and so i belonged , drawn into a web of relationships , alliances and grudges that i did not yet understand , ' he wrote			0
the president visited @entity2 two more times , most recently in 2006 as a freshman senator			2
he was greeted by cheering crowds in the capital of @entity111 and in @entity126 , where he spent time with his grandmother and visited his father 's grave			2
he and wife @entity51 also publicly took @entity154 tests , part of their campaign at the time to reduce the stigma surrounding the virus			0
but @entity0 's nationally televised speech criticizing the government for failing to curb corruption or instill trust in its people earned him a cold shoulder from @entity2 's leadership			1
@entity2 's presidential spokesman said at the time that @entity0 was ignorant of @entity2 politics and had yet to form an understanding of foreign policy			1
@entity2 's president @entity28 has been charged by the @entity22 as an ' indirect co-perpetrator ' for the crimes of murder , deportation , rape and inhumane acts @entity2 is an important strategic partner for the @entity1 in @entity178			1
but the recent election has complicated the relationship			0
@entity181 , who until april served as head of the @entity184 's @entity5 bureau , said in the lead - up to this year 's election that ' choices have consequences , ' a comment that was viewed as a warning against electing @entity28			2
his remarks were widely criticized as an inappropriate intrusion into a sovereign nation 's elections			0
@entity28 , the son of the country 's first president , has been charged by the @entity22 as an ' indirect co-perpetrator ' for the crimes of murder , deportation , rape , persecution and inhumane acts allegedly committed by his supporters in the aftermath of the 2007 elections			1
he insists he is innocent of any wrongdoing			0
more than 1,000 people were killed in the ethnic violence that followed the flawed 2007 contest			0
