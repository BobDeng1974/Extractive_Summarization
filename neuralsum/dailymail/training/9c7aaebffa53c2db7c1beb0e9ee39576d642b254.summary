by @entity0 last updated at 11:23 am on 27th september 2011 the @entity3 government used taxpayers ' money to buy semi-automatic weapons , then sold them to criminals and allowed the guns to disappear , a leaked document reveals			1
the bombshell disclosure undermines the @entity11 's defence that @entity12 , under which the arms - dealing was sanctioned , was a ' botched ' operation where agents merely ' lost track ' of weapons			1
in the document , obtained by @entity19 , federal agent @entity18 was given signed approval by a supervisor at the @entity22 to purchase six semi-automatic @entity24 pistols			1
@entity26 : a document reveals a federal bureau authorised the purchase of guns and then sold them to criminals			1
this picture shows a cache of seized weapons as part of the operation mr @entity18 then sold the pistols to known illegal buyers , while fellow agents watched from their cars nearby , and ultimately allowed the weapons to vanish into the underworld , @entity19 reported			1
begun in october 2009 as part of @entity44 , which aimed to deprive @entity46 drugs cartels of guns , @entity12 gave agents the go - ahead to sell firearms to smugglers in a bid to gather intelligence and see where the guns ended up			1
in total , @entity3 officials allowed the sale of more than 2,000 guns to the @entity58 , worth $ 1.25million			1
the leaked document reveals that in june 2010 , the @entity22 allowed the @entity3 government to become the actual ' seller ' of guns			2
in a letter dated june 1 , 2010 , then @entity64 supervisor @entity63 instructed a @entity66 in @entity67 to allow for the purchase of ‘ four ( 4 ) @entity69 , @entity24 , 7.62x39 mm pistols , by special agent @entity18			2
’ whistleblower : agent @entity18 was given a signed letter to use when buying the weapons			2
he has since turned whistleblower it read : ' these aforementioned pistols will be used by special agent @entity18 in furtherance of the performance of his official duties			2
' in the lower left - hand margin of the one - page letter is the hand - written note : ' picked guns up 6/10/10 paid cash '			2
mr @entity18 then sold the weapons to known illegal buyers , while fellow agents watched from their cars nearby			0
this was not a sting operation , where police sell to a buyer and then arrest them immediately afterwards , @entity19 reported			0
in this case , agents were ' ordered ' to let the sale go through and follow the weapons to a stash house			0
sources told @entity19 that mr @entity18 felt strongly that the weapons should not be abandoned and the stash house should remain under 24 - hour surveillance			0
however , mr @entity63 disagreed and ordered the surveillance team to return to the office			0
mr @entity18 refused , and for six days in the desert heat kept the house under watch , defying direct orders			0
a week later , a second vehicle showed up to transfer the weapons , @entity107 reported			0
mr @entity18 called for an interdiction team to move in , make the arrest and seize the weapons , but mr @entity63 reportedly refused and the guns disappeared with no surveillance			0
on the defence : the @entity22 is under fire after two of the weapons allowed to ' walk ' as part of @entity12 were were found at the fatal shooting of an @entity3 @entity122 agent according to a story posted on a website dedicated to covering @entity12 , mr @entity63 gave mr @entity18 the assignment to ' dirty him up , ’ since mr @entity18 was a vocal critic of the operation			1
' i think @entity18 demanded the letter from @entity129 to cover both himself and the @entity130 )			0
he did n't want to be hung out to dry by @entity132 , ' a source told the website @entity134			0
mr @entity18 has turned whistleblower on the @entity136 , giving interviews with @entity138 which detail how guns were allowed to ' walk ' across the border into @entity46			0
the practice erupted into the public consciousness in december last year when 40 year - old @entity12 , a member of an elite @entity3 @entity122 tactical team , was shot and killed during a violent gun battle in a remote @entity67 canyon just north of the @entity3 border with @entity46			1
two guns ' walked ' by @entity22 were found at mr @entity12 ’s murder scene , just south of @entity150 .			1
