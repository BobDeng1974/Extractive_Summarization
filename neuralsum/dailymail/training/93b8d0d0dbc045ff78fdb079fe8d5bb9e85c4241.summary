by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:19 est , 14 july 2013 updated : 19:19 est , 14 july 2013 deterrent : a trident missile launches from a nuclear - powered submarine @entity6 plans to downgrade @entity9 ’s @entity8 nuclear deterrent represent a ‘ risk no responsible government would take ’ , defence secretary @entity5 warned last night			1
in a strongly - worded article for the @entity13 , mr @entity5 accuses @entity14 of taking a ‘ reckless ’ gamble with national security by pushing for the trusted @entity8 system to be replaced by a cut - down deterrent			1
his intervention comes as leaked documents reveal an extraordinary @entity6 plan to halve the number of @entity8 submarines from four to two and send them to sea unarmed			2
tomorrow mr @entity5 will publish a formal review of alternatives to the @entity8 system			1
the review was demanded by mr @entity14 , whose party is pushing for an end to the continuous at - sea deterrent that has kept @entity9 safe for 45 years			2
mr @entity5 makes it clear that both he and @entity33 have already rejected any alternative to a full replacement of the existing system			1
he says the government remains ‘ 100 per cent committed to maintaining and renewing the @entity39 ’ , which uses a fleet of submarines to keep @entity9 ’s nuclear missiles permanently at unknown locations at sea			1
tridents are carried on board four @entity48 nuclear - powered submarines operating out of @entity49 on the @entity50			0
the ageing fleet will come to the end of its life in the mid- 2020s			1
the conservatives and @entity55 want to replace it with a new £ 20billion generation of state - of - the - art submarines , which would cost about £ 3billion a year to run			0
a decision will not be taken until 2016			0
the @entity6 are pushing for the fleet to be cut to three , or even two , with the missiles left at vulnerable locations on land most of the time			2
they argue that it is time to move on from the @entity67			0
mr @entity5 says the move would make little difference to the cost of renewing the @entity8 system , but would pose an unacceptable risk at a time when there are more than 17,000 nuclear weapons in the world and a string of hostile states such as @entity79 trying to obtain them			1
ageing : the @entity8 fleet will come to the end of its life in the mid- 2020s but the government is committed to replacing it ‘ history teaches us that the defence of this country means being ready for the unexpected , ’ mr @entity5 says			1
documents leaked to the @entity13 reveal @entity6 proposals to build only two new submarines to replace the current four			0
this would end the requirement for one to be always on patrol at sea			0
the proposal , which will be debated at the party ’s annual conference in september , was finalised by a high - level @entity6 working group involving chief secretary to the treasury @entity100			2
critics said having only two boats meant every other nation would know when the @entity9 had an unarmed submarine at sea , undermining the deterrent effect			0
they also said having a ‘ declaratory policy ’ of deploying only unarmed missiles would be a ‘ gift ’ to other nations			0
a well - placed @entity113 source said : ‘ hostile leaders around the globe would sigh with relief that the @entity9 was no longer a serious military nation			0

defence secretary @entity5 has criticised plan to downgrade
says @entity84 is ' 100 *%* committed ' to replacing ageing fleet
