the most depressing words of this young sporting year were spoken last week by @entity2			1
by common consent , the @entity4 fast bowler is a gentle , pleasant , rather shy individual , whose attitudes change dramatically when he walks on to a cricket pitch			0
he then becomes a stage villain ; angry , confrontational and abrasively insulting			0
one of the more discordant sounds of an @entity11 summer is the distant drone of @entity2 sledging his chosen victim			1
but he has no regrets ; indeed , he is actually proud of his behaviour			0
one of the more discordant sounds of an @entity11 summer is the distant drone of @entity2 sledging @entity4 's @entity2 ( right ) believes sledging is entertaining when done in the right manner ‘ i do n’t think at the moment there is any more sledging than there ’s been in the history of cricket , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n’t think it should disappear from the game			2
i think it ’s quite entertaining when it ’s done in the right manner			0
’ equally smug is the @entity32 wicket keeper @entity31 , who defended @entity33 after the serial buffoon had been heard to bawl ‘ speak @entity11 ! ’ at @entity36 ’s @entity35			1
‘ we know the brand of cricket we want to play and @entity40 ’s no different to all of us , ’ said @entity31			1
‘ every @entity32 team i ’ve played in respects the game of cricket and respects the opposition			2
we ’re pretty comfortable with the way we ’re playing			0
’ he was supported by @entity32 ’s coach @entity46 , aka ‘ @entity47 ’			1
‘ if the @entity49 decides it ’s not in the spirit of the game or we cross the line , it ’ll come down on us , ’ he said			1
‘ we ’re always going to teeter pretty close to it , that ’s just the way we play , but we ’ve got to make sure we do n’t cross it			2
’ interestingly , @entity47 has some form on the disciplinary front			2
there was that unfortunate business in 2003 , when he shouted ‘ black * * * * * ’ in the dressing room after being run out against @entity62 at @entity63			1
he was banned for five matches , thus escaping far too lightly			0
then there was his jibe at @entity4 ’s paceman @entity67 , shortly before the 2013 - 14 ashes series @entity69 : ‘ i just hope the @entity32 public give it to him right from the word go for the whole summer , and i hope he cries and goes home			1
’ that ’s @entity47 , one of nature ’s line - crossers			1
@entity32 's @entity33 argues with @entity36 's @entity35 during their one day international now it is probably true that few people outside @entity32 take @entity46 seriously , but @entity2 ’s position is far more disturbing			1
for he sincerely believes that sledging , the crude , ugly , choreographed abuse of an opponent , is not only legitimate but ‘ quite entertaining ’			1
@entity88 exposed the fallacy of that approach in two concise sentences			0
‘ it seems you can walk onto the field , say anything you want about somebody and then walk off and forget about it , ’ said @entity88			1
‘ you would n’t walk into somebody ’s office and let rip at them for 10 minutes and then go for a cup of tea			2
’ @entity103 , the former @entity4 fast bowler and @entity105 cricket correspondent , expressed his concern rather more vigorously			2
‘ it ’s all you hear on a field — “ knock his head off , knock his head off ” , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity112 has gone too far			2
it should n’t be posturing , abusing			0
’ he defended aggressive bowling , but insisted : ‘ it ’s the histrionics , the nonsense , the prancing , the in - your - face nastiness			1
it ’s become accepted , and actually it ’s not acceptable at all			0
’ @entity103 was absurdly attacked for his stand , on the grounds that cricketers have been behaving badly throughout the history of the game ; as if oafishness was sanctified by custom			2
but he was undeniably correct			0
there is a worrying belief that the game alone is incapable of holding the public ’s attention			0
hence the search for trivial solutions and cheap gimmicks			0
less a game , more a game show , in which nothing succeeds like excess			0
@entity142 ' @entity141 is one of football 's most prolific self - promoting ' characters ' @entity145 has travelled some way along that path , with a turgid cast of self - promoting ‘ characters ’ , along with @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity141 , and lashings of banal banter from mirthless celebs			1
a wonderful game , intelligently administered , yet selling itself short by embracing embarrassing distractions			0
as for professional boxing , it long ago abandoned any ambition to be treated as serious sport			2
the fighters themselves remain wonderful athletes and admirable people , but the sad old game is now a branch of showbusiness , with its ring - walks and its trash - talk , its scripted threats and its phony feuds			2
the sport which once gave us @entity174 and @entity175 now offers @entity176 and @entity177 , not to mention @entity178 and @entity179			1
the well is dry , the end is a matter of time			0
if all this should sound unremittingly bleak , then the impression is false			0
despite the dreary drip of resentful criticism , the @entity186 left our sport in a healthier , more confident condition			0
@entity178 ( right ) and @entity179 face off before their heavyweight fight last november despite an unprecedented number of counter-attractions , sport at large — and most prominently the crown jewel sport of cycling — is fighting the good fight for attention and participation			1
those of us who stood on the packed pavements to watch the @entity205 speed through the glories of the @entity208 countryside will testify that the @entity209 respond to genuine sporting events like no other nation			0
we remain hopelessly in thrall to sport , yet that sport must be valid , authentic , untainted by contrivance			0
and that is why @entity2 ’s remark was so concerning			1
for there is no right to abuse , no licence to insult			0
the belief such behaviour is ‘ quite entertaining ’ is the cod philosophy of the professional wrestling ring			1
it is a great pity , for @entity11 cricket is currently facing all manner of demanding problems			0
@entity2 has made their solution no easier			1
@entity232 ’s reputation dented by his drivel by the knee - jerk standards of television punditry , @entity232 is a serious man			1
but even serious men can be swept away by the pressure to transform the mundane into something guaranteed to start an argument in the pub. hence his reaction when an @entity244 footballer named @entity245 became involved in a foolish spat with his colleague and designated penalty taker , @entity249 , over who should take a penalty in the match with @entity253			1
having insisted on taking the kick , @entity245 missed it , thereby costing his team two crucial points			1
now we can probably agree that @entity245 is an irksome clown , that @entity249 is more docile than an @entity4 defender ought to be and that the @entity244 captain @entity261 has the leadership qualities of a garden gnome			1
@entity245 ( right ) talks to @entity249 and holds the ball in his hands , determined to take the penalty @entity232 described @entity245 ' decision to take the penalty as a ' despicable breach of team orders ' @entity271 said @entity244 's senior players should have intervened and told @entity245 to let @entity249 take it but that did not go nearly far enough for our @entity232			1
it was , he said , ‘ a scandal ’			1
‘ one of the most despicable breaches of team spirit you can possibly have			2
you do not do that at any cost ! ’ and there was more			2
‘ it does n’t get much worse , ’ said @entity232			1
‘ you can punch someone , you can go over the top and break someone ’s leg , which is unnecessary , in a tackle , but to go against team orders in the dressing room is terrible			2
it ’s one of the worst things you can do			0
’ the entire diatribe was delivered with an heroically straight face			0
yet @entity232 was talking the kind of nonsense he would have mocked without mercy in his days as a player			1
does he seriously believe that snapping an opponent ’s leg is merely ‘ unnecessary ’ , but taking a penalty against orders is scandalous , selfish and despicable ? of course not			1
but @entity305 is never knowingly undersold , so he delivered his drivel in apocalyptic tones , while the suits in the studio stared on in mute approval			0
next time controversy comes along , we must hope that @entity232 resists the lure of amateur dramatics			1
for he is a serious man , with points to make and things to say			0
and now , a reputation to retrieve			2
@entity318 he has a formidable record at major football clubs			0
he also enjoys an imperious air , a disdainful stare and a way with an empty platitude			0
and yet , his tactics appear to bewilder his own players and his team is frequently sterile and unappealing			0
if he possessed an ordinary name — something like ‘ @entity331 ’ , perhaps — the manager of @entity333 might be under a great deal of pressure			2
instead , his name is @entity337 and he is currently immune from criticism			0
he really ought to make the most of the truce			0
for it may not last			0
@entity337 has hardly fared any better than @entity331 but has so far been immune from criticism			0

@entity2 said sledging is fine when done in the right way
@entity145 has its own turgid cast of self - promoting ‘ characters ’
boxing gave us @entity174 and @entity175 now offers @entity178 and @entity179
@entity232 has a reputation to retrieve after his @entity245 comments
