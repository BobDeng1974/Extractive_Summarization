by @entity0 nursery nurse @entity1 has been refused the chance to have her dead husband ’s baby because @entity6 bosses said it would make her a single parent			1
mrs @entity1 last night told how she had been refused @entity10 treatment using sperm taken from her husband of only eight months			1
surgeons had even reversed @entity15 ’s vasectomy as he lay dying from bowel cancer , just months after the couple married , so the sperm could be harvested and frozen to fulfil the couple ’s desperate wish to have a baby			1
@entity1 has been denied the chance to have her dead husband @entity23 's baby , after @entity6 bosses refused her £ 3,500 @entity10 treatment , on the grounds she is now single mrs @entity1 said @entity6 staff had turned her down for @entity10 treatment because , as a widow , she was officially single			1
the 32 - year - old married mr @entity15 , 39 , in april 2012 , but just eight months later he died			1
having already discussed names for their unborn child , mr @entity15 ’s dying wish was for his wife to have it using his frozen sperm			1
however , just months after his death , mrs @entity1 was denied the £ 3,500 treatment by her local @entity6 commissioning group			1
still wearing his wedding ring on a chain around her neck , mrs @entity1 said : ‘ i wanted his child more than anything			1
i promised him on his death bed			0
‘ for the names , it was going to be @entity47 for a girl and @entity49 for a boy			0
eight months after the couple married in april 2012 , mr @entity15 died after being diagnosed with bowel cancer			1
while on his deathbed , the 39 - year - old asked doctors to reverse his vasectomy and harvest his sperm so his wife could undergo @entity10 local clinical commissioning groups across the @entity59 decide whether to fund @entity10 on the @entity6			1
the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) has a set of guidelines on treatment for fertility problems			2
it recommends up to three ivf cycles should be available on the @entity6 if : the woman is aged between 23 and 39 at the time of treatment and : women aged 40 - 42 who have not conceived after two years of regular , unprotected sex or after 12 cycles of artificial insemination should be offered one @entity10 cycle if the following criteria are met : implementation of the guidance by @entity79 varies as it is not @entity81 criteria , used by some @entity79 , includes : source : @entity83 ‘ then the @entity84 refused to fund me			1
they told me the policy means they can only give the treatment to couples , so because i ’m a widow living on my own i ’m not allowed to have the treatment			2
i would have a husband if he had n’t died			2
‘ i ’m not single , i ’m widowed			0
’ the decision has left mrs @entity1 , of @entity94 , @entity95 , trying to save up for the treatment , but she says that could take years			1
‘ all i was asking them for was one little bit of help , ’ she said			0
‘ i feel really angry because they ’re letting women have boob jobs and tummy tucks on the @entity6 but wo n’t help someone like me			1
‘ i did n’t ask to be a widow			0
i would either be pregnant or have the baby by now if @entity23 had been here			0
‘ i look at pregnant people now and i think “ why is that not me ? ” it should have been me pushing a pram now or with a bump			0
’ the couple met on @entity112 2010 , and mr @entity15 proposed the following @entity113			2
they married in @entity94 in april 2012 , but just five months later , mr @entity15 was diagnosed with bowel cancer and , despite originally being told he could have more than 18 months to live , he died in january 2013			1
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ as he was slipping away i held his hand and told him i loved him and i promised him i would have the child and take them to @entity119 like we planned			1
‘ on the last breath i saw a little tear roll down his face and then he was gone			0
’ mrs @entity1 ’s mother , @entity125 , 56 , said the experience had been incredibly difficult for the family			1
she said : ‘ my daughter has n’t chosen to be in this situation			0
she always wanted to be a mum and have a child with the husband she loves , the man of her dreams			0
‘ he brought some life into our house and children loved him , he was like the @entity140			0
nobody ever said a bad word about him			0
‘ when they turned her down for the ivf like that , i was so upset and angry			0
‘ i could n’t help my daughter to save her husband but this is one thing i can try to do for her			0
’ @entity148 associate director @entity147 said its policy of not commissioning @entity10 for single parents was in line with other ccgs in the @entity154			1
miss @entity147 added : ‘ the policy is for use when a couple have a medical reason for being unable to conceive a child			0
’ @entity160 from @entity161 , had a boob job on the @entity6 to boost her confidence the number of breast enlargements has soared by 145 per cent in a decade to 10,504 – costing up to £ 52.5million			1
many of these will be reconstructions following cancer treatment , but the increase far outstrips any rise in breast cancer diagnoses			2
in one case , @entity160 had an enlargement after saying her @entity176 chest was ruining her life			0
the former prostitute and wannabe glamour model provoked outrage when it emerged she had a £ 4,800 state - funded boob job at the same @entity183 that refused to pay for surgery to allow a disabled two - year - old to walk			1
she later claimed her breasts , which were boosted from a @entity176 to a @entity187 , were ' so big ' she found them embarrassing , and called on the @entity6 to pay for a reduction			1
and barman @entity190 , 22 , of @entity191 , in the @entity192 , was given a nose job by the @entity6 – and boasted how easy it was to get the £ 5,000 procedure			1
he now says he expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for further surgery , including another nose job , as well as having his ears pinned back and jaw reshaped			0
the obesity epidemic has also had an effect on the surgery bill , with the number of liposuction operations in 2012/13 standing at 1,926 – up 40 per cent in ten years			0
the cost in the most recent year will have been up to £ 9.6million , according to @entity83 which says the operation costs between £ 1,500 and £ 5,000			2
there has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid surgery to 4,966 – costing up to £ 19.9million			2
this operation is supposed to be carried out to treat affected vision			0
and 8,537 nose jobs were carried out in 2013/14 – up 4 per cent and costing £ 34.1million			2
@entity216 , of the @entity217 ’ @entity215 , said : ‘ it ’s ludicrous the @entity6 pays for procedures that are not based on strict medical needs			2
’ the figures were compiled by the @entity222 , following a request from the @entity224			0
it also showed that up to £ 20.3million was spent on breast reduction operations , £ 5.8million on tummy tucks and £ 5.7million on ear pinning			1
however , these totals have declined over the past decade			0
last month health secretary @entity230 told a @entity232 lunch : ‘ we should not be doing cosmetic work on the @entity6			2
’ @entity235 , of pressure group @entity236 , said : ‘ there are two types of cosmetic surgery – the type that happens after illness and the sort where someone is just trying to look better			0
' we agree with the secretary of state that this kind of thing is no longer affordable on the @entity6			2
in fact , it is amazing it was ever considered affordable at all			0

on his deathbed the 39 - year - old asked doctors to reverse his vasectomy and harvest his sperm to *freeze* for @entity10
