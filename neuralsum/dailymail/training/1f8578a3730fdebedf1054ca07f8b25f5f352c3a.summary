by @entity0 published : 19:45 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 19:45 est , 13 june 2013 it is often regarded as the @entity3 ’s greatest military victory			2
led into battle by the @entity7 , @entity5 troops routed @entity8 at the @entity9 , a triumph ushering in almost a century of peace and stability in @entity12			1
but the government is refusing to mark the battle ’s 200th anniversary in 2015 amid suspicions it does not want to offend @entity18			1
that decision is in stark contrast to @entity21 - where the clash took place			1
the government in @entity25 is spending at least £ 20million on commemorative events , including restoring the battlefield			1
a painting of the @entity9 , which will celebrate its bicentennial in 2015			1
the government has pledged little support to the occasion instead , there will only be ‘ initiatives ’ at military museums and ‘ some commemorative activity ’ at the @entity7 ’s former homes			1
the decision also contrasts with the major events organised to mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in 2007 which involved an apology on behalf of the nation by then prime minister @entity45			1
culture minister @entity46 has told the bicentenary campaign group @entity47 that he will not help			2
the government has also declined to hand over a single penny for any events			1
culture minister @entity46 has told the bicentenary campaign group @entity47 that he will not help			2
@entity51 , secretary of @entity52 , which is organising commemorations including a service at @entity56 ’s and a re-enactment of the @entity58 , where @entity5 troops travelled with three captured @entity18 troops to @entity61 to tell the @entity62 of victory , said he was ‘ disappointed ’			2
he said : ‘ the government has given us its blessing but it is difficult to know why they are not being overly supportive			0
‘ they have encouraged us but they have not got behind us			0
‘ the @entity21 government has spent millions on events to commemorate the battle but we have been given zilch , zippo , nothing			1
i think it ’s very disappointing			0
‘ @entity9 was a milestone in @entity12 history which ended over 20 years of conflict in @entity12			1
‘ we ca n’t let the 200th anniversary pass without marking it and learning lessons about why it was so important			0
’ @entity85 , editor of the @entity87 ’s journal , said : ‘ when you look at some of the crazy ideas that the government wastes money on , you would have thought they might have found some for the @entity9 commemorations			0
' it ’s an appalling indictment of where their priorities lie			0
’ @entity99 , director of the @entity101 think - tank , said : ‘ this is very unsatisfactory , especially if the reason is not to insult the @entity18 or because celebrating the victory would be seen as bad or triumphalist			0
‘ it appears to be ludicrous hyper - sensitivity			0
‘ @entity9 was a battle of the most immense importance			2
@entity5 was fighting a tyrant who had conquered @entity12			1
it was a momentous moment that should be commemorated			0
we should be shouting it from the rooftops			0
’ in a message to @entity52 , the 8th @entity7 said : ‘ i am often asked whether we should not now , in these days of @entity12 unity , forget @entity9 and the battles of the past			1
@entity8 , @entity118 , whose power was broken at @entity9 thanks to the @entity5 forces , led by the @entity7 , and a @entity122 force ‘ my reply is , history can not be forgotten and we need to be reminded of the bravery of the thousands of men from many nations who fought and died in a few hours and why their gallantry and sacrifice ensured peace in @entity12 for 50 years			1
’ @entity9 was fought a few miles south of @entity25 on june 18 , 2015			2
@entity7 described his own troops as ‘ very weak and ill - equipped , and a very inexperienced staff ’			0
@entity5 and its allies had 68,000 men , and were joined by about 45,000 @entity137 on the evening of the battle			2
the @entity18 had 72,000 troops			0
heavy rain had turned the battlefield into a swamp			0
the scale of casualties was staggering - around one in four men were killed			0
but the victory brought about the final destruction of @entity8 ’s army and the end of his bloody reign as dictator .			1

the battle ended tyranny of @entity8 and ushered in peace across @entity12
but the 2015 *landmark* is getting no official support
in stark contrast , @entity21 is spending £ 20million on events
