by @entity1 reporter published : 09:26 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 09:40 est , 3 september 2012 recluse : dr @entity4 's medical notes provide a fascinating insight into the later life of heiress @entity7 , pictured aged 24 the head of the hospital where reclusive heiress @entity7 spent the last 20 years of her life said that it was n't his job to ask questions about why the elderly woman continued to stay in the facility for such a long period of time			1
now , as @entity20 's family brings the battle of the former socialite 's nearly half - billion fortune to court , dr. @entity18 has testified that he repeatedly asked for large gifts from the copper heiress but did n't feel it was his place to inquire about her health or her reasons for staying in the hospital instead of returning to her massive @entity33 apartment			1
he ' testified that while he found it unusual that @entity36 refused to leave @entity37 since she was first admitted , and knew that she never left her hospital room , he did nothing to find out why , ' court documents submitted by the @entity20 relatives reveal			1
instead , he referred to her as ' the biggest bucks - contributing potential we 've ever had '			1
at the time of her death , the 104 - year - old @entity20 was worth an estimated $ 400million , but her relatives argue now that said fortune was frequently mined for gifts by her care givers and @entity37 , where she first moved into in 1991 and remained until her death in 2011			1
' the record reveals a pattern at @entity37 of soliciting gifts from @entity36 almost immediately after she entered the hospital in 1991 while ignoring its undeniable duty to evaluate @entity36 â€™s psychiatric condition , provide her with any psychiatric care and establish a plan for her discharge , ' court documents discovered by the @entity70 reveal			2
in a 2005 email , published by the newspaper , @entity18 , who is a board member and former ceo of the facility , wrote : ' @entity76 as you know is the biggest bucks contributing potential we 've ever had - but / and without knocking her past gifts , the potential has been overwhelming ( ly ) unrealized :-) ' care : @entity7 first entered @entity37 ( left ) in 1991 and remained there until her death last year			1
former hospital ceo @entity18 ( right ) wrote in an email that she was ' big bucks ' her relatives are accusing the hospital where the wealthy heiress spent her later life of rinsing her fortune to the tune of more than $ 13million in fees , donations and even a priceless painting			1
as the court case continues , more details emerge about her condition and reclusive lifestyle that was all but a mystery ever since she disappeared off the @entity102 social scene largely after her mid-twenties			2
according to the @entity70 , dr @entity4 describes his first , ' most strange ' encounter with the daughter of industrialist and senator @entity20 in his musings			0
at a friend 's urging , @entity4 visited her 10 - room , 5,000 - square - foot @entity112 apartment in 1991 only to find that she was elderly , emaciated and ' looking like an advanced leper patient ' due to skin cancer			0
her 75 pound frame was clothed in an old , soiled bathrobe and she appeared to be ' nearly at death 's door , ' according to newly published medical notes that give a fascinating account of the notoriously reclusive woman 's final years			0
shut in : @entity20 was found living in just one room of her 5,000 - square - foot apartment at @entity125 , pictured once beautiful : the last photo of ms @entity7 was taken in 1930 and a doctor recently revealed that when he saw her in 1991 , skin cancer had devastated @entity20 's once - attractive face making her look like a leper then 85 - years - old , @entity4 said @entity20 was like ' an apparition ' when he found her living in just one room of the lavish 907 @entity33 apartment - one of three the millionaire owned - using a single candle for light			1
she held a towel over her mouth to hide her partially missing lower lip and ulcers had eaten away at the lid of her right eye and cheek			0
during the visit , he coaxed her out into the light , persuading her to move to the nearby @entity37			0
after a few months at the @entity149 hospital , the heiress was well enough to return home			0
she had gained weight and surgeries had improved her appearance and helped her cancer			0
but she never re-emerged from the facility , and , according to @entity156 , she never said why			0
@entity4 claims @entity20 hinted at her reason for remaining locked in dismal hospital rooms with the shades drawn and the door shut when she read him a poem about a cricket and a butterfly			2
inheritance : @entity20 , pictured with her father and sister , inherited her vast wealth from industrialist and senator @entity20 ' the upshot of it was she wanted to remain a cricket rather than to be this beautiful butterfly that was flying around , because it was basically safer for her and she felt more secure , ' @entity4 wrote in his account			2
@entity4 continued to care for the woman while she was at the $ 800 - a - day hospital and he received monthly payments totaling $ 521,025 between 1997 and 2011			0
he taught the woman solitaire ' and she learned every game in the book , improvising and inventing new games			0
she has a ' steel trap ' memory , ' he wrote , ' but remains shy and reticent			0
' @entity20 paid his malpractice insurance premiums also left the doctor $ 100,000 in her will , which is now being disputed			2
but according to the @entity70 , @entity37 hospital made the most out of @entity20 's impressive wealth , milking her for more than $ 13million in fees , donations and even a @entity191 painting during her 20 - year stay			1
and bosses at the medical centre wanted even more , trying to squeeze a whopping $ 125million out of the heiress to keep the hospital 's outpost alive , her relatives claim in court documents .			1
