@entity0 live for the weekend , which means that a friday or saturday night out lasts well into the following day - and beyond			1
for some peace and quiet in the mornings , the lofty @entity4 on the seafront keeps you away from the throng , but is still only a pleasant 40 - minute walk from the historical centre			1
what ’s more , the neatly curved , man - made beaches , crafted for the @entity11 , are right on your doorstep			1
up all night to get arty : @entity14 is a city that treats the idea of sleep as an optional extra this formerly edgy industrial area has responded brilliantly to the ultimate facelift			1
promenade along the waterfront on a sunday and there are beach volleyball matches , surfers , roller skaters , families looking their best , food stalls and a feeling of festivity			1
further along is the attractive old fishing village , @entity30			2
this triangle of streets was built on land reclaimed from the sea in the 18th century			2
it ’s now a buzzing area and a good spot for a cerveza ( beer ) in a local bar			2
right next door is @entity42 , the famously hippy cultural enclave , where you can buy elegant jewellery from @entity46 designer @entity45 , visit the @entity47 or admire the gothic cathedral			1
the latter 13th - century wonder draws crowds who wander the vaulted interior with @entity52 before them like holy visions			1
i even see a monk snapping away with a digital slr			2
the ceiling is misty with incense from the morning service , and the dark drama of the interior is enough to keep you on the straight and narrow			0
so , too , is the curious @entity63 around the corner			0
this cavernous place , with a collection to rival the ultimate hoarder , is almost deserted			0
the first floor is given over to wooden crucifixes — an arresting sight			0
then there are combs , cigarette cards , crowns , lanterns , ceramics , gold plates , pocket watches , canes , reliquaries and more			0
it is not for everyone			0
a city old and new : the @entity84 at the heart of the @entity86 ( left ) ; the @entity4 on the waterfront ( right ) but @entity88 , a @entity89 sculptor and a man of voracious energy who travelled widely , must have had deep pockets			0
a calmer option is the @entity47			1
his avant - garde work is well known , but it is fascinating to see the early talent of the teenage painter			1
the museum is ( unfashionably ) arranged chronologically - and , as a result , is brilliant			2
the portrait of his father , painted in 1896 when @entity104 would have been 15 , is a sensitive masterwork			0
then there are the attractive pastel landscapes which mark his time in @entity110 , a village south - west of @entity14 ; and the pigeon series ( really ) , painted in 1957 in the @entity113 , and reminiscent of @entity115 ’s bright , patterned works			1
while on @entity14 ’s artistic greats , it would be inconceivable to leave out the wildly imaginative @entity118			1
his @entity120 cathedral - set for completion in 2026 - is covered in cranes			2
but if you want to see a complete building , @entity123 is the other favourite			0
we arrive early and are rewarded by no queues			0
people live in this curvaceous apartment building that is astonishing in its attention to detail and every bit as art nouveau as the sadly damaged @entity135 @entity14 's waterfront was transformed from industrial zone to urban beach in time for the @entity11 the roof is like a surrealist desert painting by @entity141 , and the interior is filled with lovely things - from a retro phone to specially designed floor tiles			1
the other great @entity14 tradition - aside from tapas - is brunch			1
you can snack in the @entity150 , the indoor food market that sells razor clams by the bushel , cured meat on a stick and freshly squeezed juices			0
or make a day of it at the @entity4 - where it ’s a five - course extravaganza - including cuttlefish risotto and eggs benedict followed by a deep snooze			2
it is nice to see families getting together with everyone turned out beautifully			0
the @entity0 have the right idea — the weekend should be savoured			0
flights to @entity14 with @entity169 ( www.easyjet.com ) cost from £ 36.99 per person , one way			1
rates at the @entity4 ( @entity173 ) start at £ 245 per room per night including breakfast .			0

while one of @entity179 's best - known cities , @entity14 packs a visual *punch*
its seafront , restored for the @entity11 , offers a splendid urban beach
the @entity47 shows works by the great artist in his formative years
