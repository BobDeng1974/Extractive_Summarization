@entity1 ( left ) stole a kestrel chick from its nest when he was a boy , sparking a fascination with wildlife			1
he said his actions - which have echoes of the 1969 film @entity15 ( right ) - ' defined the rest of my life ' he said : ‘ i found a nest			2
on june 26 , 1975 , at about 2.15pm , i climbed to it and i removed one of the youngsters illegally			2
’ he added : ‘ i think that what happened as a result of me taking that bird out of the nest was incredibly important and defined the rest of my life			1
i loved that bird and that was the first time that i learned to love something			1
’ @entity1 , now vice-president of the @entity40 , said he resorted to taking the bird only after he was refused a licence which would have allowed him to own one legally			1
his love for his charge recalls the plot line of @entity45 ’s film @entity15 which tells the story of @entity47 , 15 , and his love for the kestrel he steals from a nest on a farm			1
@entity47 , played by @entity52 , raises the bird in secret and the animal becomes a symbol of the boy ’s desperation to escape the humdrum existence of his life in a @entity61 mining town			1
the 1969 film , based on the book @entity63 by @entity64 , is ranked seventh in the @entity66 ’s list of the 100 best @entity68 films ever made , and is in its top ten list of the 50 films every child should see by the time they turn 14			1
@entity1 said : ‘ the relationship between a man and bird is very different than between man and dog			1
it ’s an animal you coax into a tameness			0
you never extract the wildness from the bird			1
you have to give everything to it			0
’ @entity1 , now vice-president of the @entity40 , said he resorted to taking the bird only after he was refused a licence which would have allowed him to own one legally @entity86 ’s obsession with the bird consumed his every waking moment – which is exactly what happens to @entity47 in the film			1
he said : ‘ i got up before school and at six o’clock in the morning i would go down and prepare its food			0
‘ i would go out and would fly it before school			0
i would run to school late and i would run back at lunchtime to make sure it was ok			0
’ ‘ of course the whole thing had to be kept secret			0
no one at school knew			0
’ he recalls the moment of pride when he confided his secret to one of the few people he could trust			0
he said : ‘ the only person i told was @entity105 , who was my biology teacher and an incredibly important early mentor in my life			0
‘ one morning he came to see it fly			0
i was so pleased to be able to stand there with my bird and fly it			1
and it went and sat in a tree			0
it sat in a tree and just looked at us			0
’ the police did visit @entity1 ’s family home in @entity122 and told him that he should not have the bird but they appear not to have taken any further action			1
a tearful @entity86 recalled : ‘ the bird became ill at the end of the summer and i sought the best veterinary care that i could			2
but the condition that it had was invariably fatal			0
‘ on december 6 , a saturday evening , it died in my arms			2
i could n’t speak for days			2
’ the police did visit @entity1 's family home in @entity122 and told him that he should not have the bird but they appear not to have taken any further action @entity1 , who shot to fame in the 1980s on the children ’s programme @entity135 , was last week tipped as a possible successor to sir @entity137 as the face of @entity140 wildlife			2
he said last night that he expected to get ‘ some flak ’ because of his confession , but added : ‘ but if it was n’t for that bird i would n’t be talking to you now			2
we are talking about something which happened in the 1970s when attitudes were different			0
‘ i think i can honestly say i have put a lot more into conservation than i have taken out of it			0
