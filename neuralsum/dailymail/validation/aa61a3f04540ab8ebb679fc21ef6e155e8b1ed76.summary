a politician who sued his rival for calling him ' @entity2 ' in a campaign leaflet is facing a £ 50,000 bill after dropping the lawsuit because he has ' developed thicker skin '			1
@entity7 launched the legal action after @entity10 opponent @entity9 distributed a circular which had his photo superimposed onto the face of the @entity15 character			1
@entity16 's @entity7 , a former deputy leader of @entity17 , claimed the leaflet implied that he was ' not to be trusted '			1
@entity7 ( left ) is facing a £ 50,000 bill after launching legal action against @entity10 opponent @entity9 ( right ) over a campaign leaflet which depicted him as @entity22 and horses but a top judge found it was not defamatory to compare someone to @entity27 's on - screen character , instead labelling it ' the stuff of political disagreement '			1
mr @entity7 later withdrew his @entity33 libel case , saying he regretted bringing the action			1
but he has now been ordered to pay £ 50,000 of his rival 's legal costs			0
speaking after the case , mr @entity7 said : ' with hindsight , i now regret having started this action			1
' i have developed a thicker skin , and in future if i dislike something written about me i will write a leaflet of my own instead of issuing a writ			2
' i do n't think anyone has gained from this case going to court			0
this is the end of it , and it 's time to move on			0
' a judge ruled that comparing mr @entity7 to @entity27 's on - screen character was critical but not defamatory the two councillors had become locked in a legal battle after the leaflet was distributed to around 2,000 homes in the @entity58 area of the @entity60 capital			1
mr @entity7 , a member of @entity60 party @entity16 , had claimed the leaflet ' questioned my probity '			1
his lawyer @entity62 had argued : ' we all know who @entity2 is - @entity2 is best described as a " loveable rogue "			2
' the loveable element of @entity2 's character comes from his good humour , his linguistic faux - pas , the amusing incidents that befall him , and the fact that he is fictional			2
' the newsletters entirely eliminate any suggestion that councillor @entity7 is in any way loveable			0
that leaves him being described as a rogue			0
' he 's not to be trusted			0
which of us would like to be compared to @entity2 ? ' mr @entity9 had maintained it was a ' light - hearted ' leaflet and that he was ' surprised ' anyone was offended by its content			2
he said he had received feedback that people ' enjoyed ' it			0
his lawyer @entity87 argued that the comparison would not have been taken literally by residents			0
high court judge @entity91 , sitting at @entity90 , said the leaflet implied that mr @entity7 was a ‘ money - loving and money - seeking entrepreneur ' who was ‘ prone to unrealistic fantasies and improbable business ideas ’			1
but he ruled that it was not unusual or defamatory to suggest that politicians ' policies are fantasies , or lacking in realism			0
he said : ' the picture and words do not mean the claimant is a roguish character			0
' mr @entity7 , who withdrew the case on legal advice , is covered by libel insurance .			2

@entity7 launched the action against @entity10 opponent @entity9
he distributed leaflet with mr @entity7 's photo imposed onto @entity2 's face
@entity16 's mr @entity7 claimed it implied that he was ' not to be trusted '
but @entity118 high court judge labelled it ' the stuff of political disagreement '
mr @entity7 said he ' regrets ' suing and said he has ' developed thicker skin '
