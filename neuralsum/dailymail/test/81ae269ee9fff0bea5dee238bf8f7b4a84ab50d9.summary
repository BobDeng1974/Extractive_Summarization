the handwritten notes of @entity1 explains in detail how @entity3 were able to take control in @entity5 by infiltrating villages and using spies the rapid growth and establishment of the @entity10 in @entity11 and @entity5 has been far from an accidental rise of religious fanaticism , but a calculated move orchestrated by one of @entity17 's closest men			1
a cache of documents , including the blueprints for an @entity3 secret service and instructions on how to infiltrate and take control of local villages have been discovered in @entity5 , @entity18 reveals			1
the handwritten charts and notes of @entity1 , a former @entity29 @entity28 colonel better known by @entity30 , explains in detail how @entity3 were able to take control in the area			2
earlier this month , @entity34 reported that @entity3 militants are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in @entity17 's army			1
despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the @entity44 extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos , @entity3 ' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late @entity29 dictator 's military			2
almost all of the regional commanders appointed by @entity3 ' leader and self - declared caliph , @entity53 , played prominent roles in the @entity56 army before the 2003 invasion of @entity11 and became involved with @entity3 either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator 's 2006 execution			2
@entity61 is widely considered to have been @entity3 leader @entity53 's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of a rebel group known as the @entity68 in january 2014			0
the new documents detailing the plans to take over @entity5 villages and establish the caliphate , seen by the @entity74 magazine , were found in @entity61 's former home in @entity76 , north of @entity77 in @entity5 , after his death			1
the ' blueprints ' outline exactly how the group intended to infiltrate villages and cities by recruiting young men as spies and establishing a ' @entity87 - like ' secret service for internal surveillance			1
@entity61 writes how the group would open a ' @entity90 office ' , an @entity92 missionary centre , which would be used as a cover to screen young men for potential suitability			0
one or two men , in their late teens or early 20s , would then be asked to spy on their village on behalf of what would then become the @entity10			0
militants : almost all the highly secretive officials overseeing the day - to - day running of the @entity10 ( pictured ) are former members of @entity17 's @entity56 army close : @entity61 is widely considered to have been @entity3 leader @entity53 's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution in january last year one of the most prominent former @entity29 army generals within @entity3 was @entity108 ( left ) who led the terrorists ' operations in @entity11 until he was killed in an @entity113 airstrike last november			1
@entity114 ( right ) , a former colonel in @entity29 @entity116 intelligence now plays a leading role in @entity3 ' military council haji @entity130 specific information the ' spies ' would be required to obtain , including ; ' lists of the most powerful families , their source of income , size of rebel brigades and their leaders ' and potential illegal activities and information which could be used for blackmail in the future			2
@entity61 also outlines that men loyal to @entity3 would be selected to marry the daughters of the most influential families , in order to ' ensure penetration of these families without their knowledge , ' @entity18 writes			0
another document charts a command structure for an internal intelligence organisation , outlining who would spy on who ' in case they do n't do their jobs well			0
' one former @entity5 rebel who became an @entity3 regional commander told the @entity151 that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group 's day - to - day business were ex members of @entity17 's @entity56 army			1
as well as their extensive military expertise , another key element of the commanders ' appointments has been the fact the ex-baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to @entity17 's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s			2
crucially , oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of @entity3 ' £ 2 billion - a - year income			0
influence : despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the @entity44 extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos , @entity3 ' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of @entity17 ( pictured ) past : the process of giving former @entity29 commanders senior roles was started by @entity53 's predecessor @entity181 ( left ) who was a former @entity29 army officer and therefore more trusted than the @entity183 criminal , former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded @entity3 , @entity187 ( right ) the former @entity28 generals ' connections with oil smugglers are crucial to @entity3 ' £ 2 billion - a - year income @entity193 analysts and experts believe one key reason why so many former @entity29 army commanders have joined @entity3 is due to the @entity198 law brought in l. ­ @entity199 - the @entity113 who served as temporary head of the @entity29 state following the ousting of @entity17			1
the law effectively meant that 400,000 members of the defeated @entity29 army could no longer be employed in government roles and were barred from drawing their military pensions			0
many of these highly - trained commanders joined the insurgency in the country in the mid- 2000s , which was dominated by @entity3 who at the time were known by the name @entity216 in @entity11			0
when @entity53 took control of the group in 2010 , many of these commanders were given prominent leadership roles in the hope they might win the support of the @entity44 tribes who dominate @entity11 and who have been largely ignored by the country 's @entity228 - led @entity227 government			0
the process had , however been started by @entity232 's predecessor @entity181 who was himself a former @entity29 army officer and therefore more trusted by the military than the @entity183 criminal , former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded @entity3 , @entity187			0
one of the most prominent former @entity29 army generals within @entity3 was @entity239 , who used the code name @entity108 , and was in charge of all the terrorists ' operations in @entity11 until he was killed in an @entity113 airstrike last november			0
he had previously been a colonel in military intelligence and served in @entity17 's @entity246			2
other senior figures include @entity248 , who currently acts as @entity250 's deputy leader in @entity5 and is a former military general in @entity17 's @entity28 , and @entity114 , a former colonel in @entity29 @entity116 intelligence and now plays a leading role in @entity3 ' military council			1
less prominent militants with an @entity28 backgrounds include @entity257 - a former @entity56 soldier and now an @entity3 military council member , @entity258 - a former @entity29 officer and now in charge of @entity3 suicide bombers and foreign fighters .			1
