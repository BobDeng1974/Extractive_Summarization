by @entity0 published : 04:54 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 11:46 est , 15 january 2014 a murder mystery could be solved after eight decades as scientists use modern dna techniques to identify the unknown victim of a gruesome 1930 killing			1
psychotic killer @entity7 smashed an unidentified man over the head with a mallet , then placed his body in a @entity12 and set the car on fire in a botched attempt to fake his own death			1
he never revealed the identity of the victim - but relatives of @entity20 , a man who disappeared around the same time , are convinced that their ancestor was the murdered man			1
now a group of forensic scientists are examining a sample of the victim 's dna in an attempt to establish the details of the case 83 years on			1
killer : @entity7 murdered an unidentified man after suffering a head wound during the @entity33 crime scene : @entity7 's @entity12 was found burning near @entity35 with a man trapped inside @entity7 made legal history by being convicted of murder even though no one knew who the victim was			1
he had suffered a head wound during the @entity33 , causing a personality disorder which made him ' a promiscuous rake with an enormous sexual appetite '			0
the 36 - year - old had fathered at least two illegitimate children during his post-war career as a travelling salesman , and had been hit by enormous debts which he apparently wanted to escape by faking his death			0
on november 6 1930 , @entity7 battered a man over the head near @entity35 , then put him in his own @entity12 , surrounded the body with his belongings and set the vehicle on fire			1
buried : campaigners believe that the victim , buried in this grave , could have been missing man @entity20 and are conducting dna tests on his remains he tried to escape from the scene , but two young men who were running to investigate the blaze bumped in to him nearby			1
@entity7 fled to @entity67 but was tracked down by police who had used the car 's number plate to link it to him			2
he was arrested , put on trial and hanged for murder - but he would not reveal the name of the man he had killed and took the secret to his grave			1
the victim was buried in the grave of an ' unknown man ' in a @entity82 cemetery , and has lain there ever since			2
shortly before the killing , mr @entity20 had left his @entity86 home for a doctor 's appointment , but disappeared and was never seen again			2
his family grew to believe that he had somehow crossed paths with @entity7 , and in 1957 they asked @entity91 to re-open the murder investigation			2
however , the case was not classified as a cold case because the perpetrator had been brought to justice			0
a few years ago , mr @entity20 's great - niece @entity97 was told of the family 's campaign while researching her background			2
' my nan showed me newspaper clippings together with letters that her aunt had written in 1957 , in an attempt to re-open the murder case , ' she said			0
' my family were convinced that @entity20 was @entity7 's victim			1
' it also seemed plausible that , with the advent of new technologies , we may still have a chance of positive identification			0
' mystery : @entity7 , who was apparently trying to fake his own death , never revealed the identity of his victim @entity119 , or ' @entity119 ' , could prove the key to identifying the remains of @entity7 's murder victim			1
the genetic material is found in the mitochondria of cells rather than their nuclei , and is transmitted in the womb rather than during the reproductive process - meaning that everyone 's @entity119 is an exact copy of their mother 's			0
people have much more @entity119 than nuclear dna , meaning that it is often used to identify long - dead corpses because it is more likely to remain present in the body decades later			0
another advantage of @entity119 is that because it is passed solely from mother to child , rather than being mingled with genetic material from fathers , it remains stable down the generations , providing a more secure link between ancestors and descendants			0
in the past , it has been used to identify the remains of outlaw @entity146 and @entity148 tsar @entity147 , by comparing their @entity119 to that of distant relatives			0
she was put in touch with a team of forensic scientists at the @entity156 , which famously identified a medieval skeleton found in a car park as the body of @entity160 researchers were able to obtain a tissue sample taken from the victim during a post-mortem examination carried out in a pub near the murder scene			1
the sample and the victim 's jawbone were archived in the @entity170 , now part of @entity172			2
' fortunately , the scientists obtained a full single male @entity119 profile from the slide to compare to the family , ' said a spokesman for the team			0
' it 's been very interesting and rewarding working on such a famous local murder case			0
' it was a unique investigation to be involved in , as the perpetrator had been identified long ago and brought to justice while the victim 's identity remained unknown			1
' the scientific and criminological expertise at the @entity156 and @entity188 , working together with the police , could provide answers to this family after 83 years			0
' scientists are due to reveal their results on @entity195 's @entity194 at a future date			0
a spokesman for @entity91 said that its cold case review team would discuss the findings , and could exhume the victim 's remains for further dna testing .			2

@entity7 killed unidentified man near @entity35 in botched attempt to fake his own death
he was hanged for the murder but took victim 's identity to his grave
