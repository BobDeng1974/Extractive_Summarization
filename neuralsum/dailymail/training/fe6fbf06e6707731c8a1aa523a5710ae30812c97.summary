ignoring the figures : @entity2 's @entity1 households will see a ‘ substantial boost to their spending power ’ this year , a major report reveals today			1
wages are set to surge ahead of prices as workers feel the benefit of the growing economy			1
the predictions by economists at influential think tank @entity15 undermine @entity2 ’s campaign on the cost of living			1
yesterday the party ’s deputy leader @entity1 raised the issue eight times in a tv interview as she argued ordinary people are not feeling better off			0
she declared that @entity24 was ‘ wrong ’ last week to praise @entity26 ’s economic recovery when he said it showed the @entity29 ‘ must be doing something right ’			2
and she told @entity30 on @entity32 ’s @entity31 : ‘ that growth is not being felt by people , and it ’s a recovery that ’s being accompanied by stagnation in living standards and that ’s why we ’re saying that people are no better off – the recovery has n’t reached their front door			2
’ but her claims appear to be undermined by forecasts of a buoyant economy , growing wages and falling prices			1
@entity15 ’s experts say that real disposable incomes , which take inflation into account , are expected to rise by 3.7 per cent this year , while interest rates are set to stay at 0.5 per cent until 2016			0
this will ease pressure on overstretched borrowers , although it will prolong the agony of low returns for savers			0
meanwhile , inflation will average ‘ around zero ’ in 2015 , with the economy growing by 2.9 per cent – considerably better than the 2.4 per cent predicted just three months ago			1
later this week , figures to be published by the @entity60 are expected to show that wages are rising nearly four times faster than prices			2
they should also reveal that average earnings , excluding bonuses , are nearly 2 per cent higher than a year ago			0
chancellor @entity67 , ( @entity68 ) pictured with @entity70 treasury minister @entity69 , has hailed the report as ‘ further proof ’ that the government ’s economic plan is working this means that pay is now rising substantially faster than inflation , which has crashed to a record low of 0.5 per cent on the back of falling food and fuel prices			1
the @entity15 ’s report states that the @entity26 is ‘ a clear winner ’ of the oil - price slump from $ 115 a barrel last june to less than $ 50 in recent days			2
its chief economic advisor @entity86 says the lower price will provide ‘ a shot in the arm ’ for @entity26 households , ‘ who are set to benefit from a substantial boost to their spending power ’			1
he went on : ‘ not every economy will be a winner from oil prices collapsing but the @entity26 certainly is			1
the predictions by economists at influential think tank @entity15 undermine @entity2 and @entity101 's campaign on the cost of living ‘ we have described the previous weakness of commodity prices as a silver lining in the storm clouds gathering over the world economy			1
but with oil prices now down over 50 per cent since last june , this silver lining has turned to gold			0
’ chancellor @entity67 has hailed the report as ‘ further proof ’ that the government ’s economic plan is working			2
‘ but the job is not yet done , and so we must keep working through our plan that is securing a better economic future , ’ he added			0
@entity70 treasury minister @entity69 urged companies to pass on price cuts to consumers			0
‘ falling oil prices act like a giant tax cut to the economy and will further boost our already established recovery , ’ he said			1
‘ but the full benefits will only be felt if every last penny of the oil price fall is passed on to consumers – in full and quickly			0
‘ consumers felt the pain when oil prices were high			0
it ’s only fair that they , and the economy , should feel the full benefit when they ’re falling			2
’ in @entity15 ’s report , mr @entity86 says the falling oil prices ‘ come just as the recovery was losing momentum , and will move the game up to a higher level for a year or two			1
‘ the @entity26 consumer has been lashed by rising fuel and food prices for so long , but is now the major beneficiary as these pull back			0
‘ so far , the recovery in our incomes has been driven by larger numbers entering work while earnings have been falling			0
but now , individuals can look forward to a substantial increase in real earnings			0

households to see ‘ substantial boost to their spending power ’ this year
wages will surge ahead of prices as we feel benefit of growing economy
