professor : @entity1 does not exist , according to @entity2 , an economics professor at the @entity3 it has powered the hopes and dreams of @entity8 citizens for generations			1
but the @entity1 does not actually exist , according to one economics professor			0
@entity2 , who works at the @entity3 , claims the national ethos is simply an illusion and that social mobility in the country is no higher than in the rest of the world			1
' @entity8 has no higher rate of social mobility than medieval @entity19 or pre-industrial @entity20 , ' he said			2
' that ’s the most difficult part of talking about social mobility - it 's shattering people 's dreams			2
' after studying figures from the past 100 years and applying a formula to them , mr @entity2 concluded that disadvantaged @entity8 will not be granted more opportunities if they are hard - working			1
instead , they will be stuck in their social status for the rest of their lives - and their position will , in turn , affect the statuses of their children , grandchildren and great - grandchildren , he said			2
' the @entity8 is not exceptional in its rates of social mobility , ' the professor wrote in an essay published by the @entity48			2
' it can perform no special alchemy on the disadvantaged populations of any society in order to transform their life opportunities			0
' speaking to @entity57 , he added : ' the status of your children , grandchildren , great grandchildren , great - great grandchildren will be quite closely related to your average status now			0
' however , not all of mr @entity2 's students agree with his findings , with some pointing out that although parents ' wealth has an effect on a child 's life , ' it is not the ultimate deciding factor '			1
in his essay , the professor also commented on the high number of people uprooting to the @entity8 , saying there is reason to believe they will ' have a much more difficult time ' than previous immigrants			0
' recent evidence suggests that , in reality , social mobility rates are extremely low , ' he wrote , adding that immigrating to the @entity8 ' rarely changes one ’s social status '			1
video courtesy of the @entity90 ' an illusion ' : mr @entity2 claims the national ethos is simply an illusion and that social mobility here is no higher than in the rest of the world , saying : ' @entity8 has no higher rate of social mobility than medieval @entity19 ' ' widening social inequality ' : in an essay published by the @entity48 , the professor cited figures ( pictured ) showing tdescendants of @entity106 immigrants are dropping out of high school at high rates he even went so far as to say that immigrants - particularly , illegal immigrants ( of whom , four out of five are @entity110 ) - are widening social inequality in @entity8			1
he cited 2009 figures relating to the educational attainment of 25 to 34 - year - olds in the @entity8 , which show descendants of @entity106 immigrants are dropping out of high school at significantly high rates			0
these rates are far more excessive than those of descendants of the domestic population and other immigrant groups , mr @entity2 said			0
formula : after studying figures from the past 100 years and applying this formula ( pictured ) to them , mr @entity2 concluded that disadvantaged @entity8 will not be granted more opportunities if they are hard - working they show , he said , that although @entity8 strives to portray itself as a country of opportunity that can transform citizens ' lives , it is actually no different in terms of social mobility than anywhere else			1
concluding his essay , mr @entity2 added : ' the truth is that the @entity1 was always an illusion			0
blindly pursuing that dream now will only lead to a future with dire social challenges			0

@entity2 , of @entity3 , claims @entity8 dream is simply an illusion
instead , social mobility in @entity8 is no higher than in rest of world , he says
disadvantaged citizens ' will not be granted opportunities for hard work '
they will remain stuck in social status for life - and so will their children
mr @entity2 's findings were obtained using figures from the past 100 years
but his students disagree , saying parents ' wealth is not ' deciding factor '
