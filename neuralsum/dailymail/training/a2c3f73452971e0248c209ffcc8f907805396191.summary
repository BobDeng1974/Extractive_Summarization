to those who live in the tiny village of @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity0 brings more than just a visit from @entity6			1
with the queen in residence just over a mile away , it also brings a motley collection of press and well - wishers – as well as the royal family itself			1
luckily for the villagers , they ’ve had nearly two centuries to get used to it – and as these striking images reveal , very little has changed			0
a new collection of images from the @entity22 reveal the festive traditions that the royal family @entity0 entails			1
pictured - the dining room at @entity26 the pictures , which have been taken from the @entity28 , reveal festive celebrations that manage to be both familiar while being grander than most of us will ever experience			1
and if the modern royal family prefers to dial down the grandeur in favour of family celebrations and amusing joke presents , it certainly was n’t always so			1
queen @entity38 , whose husband @entity39 introduced the festive fir to the @entity41 in 1841 , was partial to a sizeable tree as @entity44 ’s 1857 lithograph reveals			1
heavily laden with candles and surrounded by family pictures , it ’s every inch a tree fit for a queen or , indeed , an empress as @entity38 by then was			0
according to the @entity22 there are approximately 10 @entity0 trees at @entity54 castle this year , locations include @entity56 , the @entity57 , and in the @entity58 but while the current @entity49 is no stranger to an impressive pine , her 20ft specimen takes pride of place at @entity3 , while @entity49 @entity38 , in the early days of her reign at least , preferred to celebrate at @entity26			1
not that @entity26 is a tree - free zone , as @entity22 curator @entity66 explains			1
‘ there are approximately 10 trees along the visitor route this year , ’ she reveals			1
‘ locations include @entity56 , the @entity57 , in the @entity71 and in the @entity72			0
’ planning the festive décor takes approximately six months while putting everything up takes three days , with much of the work done at night			0
queen @entity38 's @entity77 - @entity76 ( 1819 - 1900 ) @entity39 driving the @entity49 and princess royal in their @entity79 , at @entity81			1
@entity82 ( lithographer ) , c.1840s the toughest job of all though , involves the 60ft spruce that dominates @entity56 come december			0
‘ it requires 2500 twinkling lights , ’ adds @entity66			0
‘ between 500 and 600 decorations are placed on it , and long ladders are required to reach the top			0
’ but the vast spruce is n’t the only striking addition made to @entity26 ’s already impressive collection of artefacts			2
another , the @entity0 table laid out in the @entity97 , gives a flavour of how the big day would have been celebrated while @entity49 @entity38 was still alive			1
' the special table display in the @entity97 at @entity26 evokes a sense of how the royal family celebrated @entity105 past , ’ explains @entity66 , who masterminded the set - up			1
‘ set with the magnificent silver - gilt grand service commissioned by @entity108 , it also includes a centrepiece which @entity39 designed , which features four of @entity38 and @entity39 's favourite pet dogs			1
' the @entity49 's @entity77 , @entity26 , 1845			1
@entity112 ( 1809 - 1878 ) christmas trees of the @entity114 and the royal children at @entity26 , 1850 @entity116 ( c. 1800 - 67 ) considerably grander , in short , than today ’s incarnation			1
but then , @entity26 , with its 1,000 rooms and a history that began with @entity121 , is itself considerably grander than the ‘ homely ’ @entity3			2
that came into the royal family in 1862 and is only one of two palaces – the other being @entity126 – personally owned by the @entity49 herself			1
originally intended to be the marital home of the then @entity129 , @entity130 and his @entity132 wife , princess @entity131 , it swiftly became a much - loved family residence			0
the current house on the site is also new in comparison to @entity26			2
while that began life as a motte and bailey castle built by @entity121 , @entity3 was designed by @entity4 architect @entity140 and completed in 1870			0
a ballroom was added in 1881 and a guest wing in the early 1890s , although that was n’t enough for its owner who , right up until the moment he died in 1910 , ‘ was continually improving his domain , repairing churches , spending money on the place in one way or another , ’ according to a letter written by a friend			0
with @entity158 gone , ownership of the house passed to @entity159 who described it as ‘ the place i love better than anywhere in the world ’ and began the tradition of spending @entity0 there			2
it was also @entity168 who began another royal @entity0 tradition – the monarch ’s annual speech to the nation			1
the first @entity0 message was broadcast to what was then the @entity176 was in 1932 , with @entity168 calling for nations to work towards peace from @entity3 ’s ‘ business room ’			2
it was a tradition enthusiastically embraced by his successor @entity181 who became king shortly after his brother @entity129 abdicated weeks before christmas 1936			0
the @entity49 's @entity77 , @entity26 , 24 dec 1857 @entity44 ( 1826 - 88 ) @entity129 had been on the throne for less than eight months before standing aside in order to marry @entity188 divorcee @entity187			1
like his father @entity159 , who had been at @entity3 when he died on the 20th january 1936 , @entity181 , who was both born and died at the house , was devoted to his @entity4 home			0
indeed , so happy was he at @entity3 , he fondly wrote of it : ‘ i have always been happy here and i love the place			0
’ under @entity181 , @entity0 at the house became more of a family affair , with his children , princess @entity49 and @entity198 , enjoying a succession of happy christmases at the house – all of which bear more than a little resemblance to the modern incarnation			1
then , as now , guests begin arriving on the 23rd although most descend on christmas eve itself			0
the tree , a 20ft spruce taken from the 20,000 - acre @entity3 , is decorated by the younger members of the family – supervised by the @entity49			0
after tea , the presents are unwrapped – a nod to the @entity131 , who introduced the @entity132 tradition after her marriage to the future @entity158 in 1863			0
@entity217 , @entity218 at @entity0 c. 1873 a formal black - tie dinner follows , with festivities ending at around 10pm when the women withdraw for coffee while the men stay on to enjoy a glass of port			2
christmas morning brings a trip to the @entity229 @entity228 in @entity3 village where the royals greet well - wishers and villagers before continuing on into church			0
@entity49 , who remains devout , goes every day during the @entity0 period , although , as last year showed , does n’t always stop to chat			1
afterwards comes lunch , served at 1pm on the dot , with traditional festive fare , including a turkey raised on the @entity3 , on the menu			0
the @entity49 then withdraws to watch her @entity0 message alone , while the rest of the family gather around the tv to watch			1
this year 's had the theme of reconciliation and included a cameo role for @entity248 and @entity250 politician @entity249			2
both featured in the @entity49 's historic visit to @entity253 in june , which also included the monarch 's first selfie , courtesy of 14 - year - old schoolboy , @entity257			0
on @entity258 comes another royal tradition - prince @entity260 's annual shoot - which will see members of the family , usually including the @entity264 and prince @entity265 , brave the cold for the chance to bag a pheasant or two			2
for @entity270 ’s @entity269 and his wife @entity271 , @entity0 is all about enjoying the snow			0
by contrast , @entity273 ’s @entity39 and princess @entity274 spend the big day making the most of the @entity278 sunshine , although with the princess still in hospital following the birth of twin babies , this year ’s celebrations look set to be a little more muted			1
but what about the rest ? @entity286 , royal expert and managing editor at @entity288 , reveals what the crowned heads of @entity290 did on december 25th			0
‘ finally @entity0 is here again and the royals in @entity290 are celebrating the festive season in many ways			2
‘ some , including @entity296 and @entity49 @entity297 , will be " at work " , while others are taking well - deserved holidays or spreading @entity0 cheer wherever they can			0
‘ in @entity132 41 royals , among them @entity303 and her heir @entity304 , will be gathered around the christmas tree for what is one of the largest royal family @entity308 in @entity290			1
‘ like the queen , @entity303 also sends a @entity0 message to her people , although @entity132 ’s speech is made on @entity314 instead			0
‘ in @entity273 , this year will be all about the twins , although swimming and giving gifts are likely to play a part in keeping with @entity273 tradition			0
‘ the @entity270 royals will enjoy the most low - key celebrations , much of which will revolve around gingerbread which is an essential way to spread @entity0 cheer			2
‘ regardless of which country is involved , the one thing that they all do have in common is that @entity0 is private and all about family			2

a series of photographs revealed by @entity22 *showcase* the royal family 's @entity0 traditions
this year sees around 10 @entity0 trees at @entity26 but experts reveal they have always been a big part of the family 's celebrations
it was @entity39 who introduced the festive fir to the @entity41 in 1841
