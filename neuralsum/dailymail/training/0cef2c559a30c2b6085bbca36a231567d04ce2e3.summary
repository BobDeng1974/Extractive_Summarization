mystery last night surrounded the whereabouts of a portrait of the @entity3 painted by shamed entertainer @entity4			1
the shamed star was commissioned by the @entity6 to mark the monarch ’s 80th birthday and although not well - received by critics , it did , briefly , hang on the walls at @entity11			1
but last night the national broadcaster was denying all knowledge of its whereabouts			1
meanwhile the gallery known last to have it have taken down all references on their website meanwhile the gallery last known to have had possession of it was not answering enquiries - and appeared to have taken all references to @entity4 down from its website			1
even sources close to the presenter and artist said they could not offer a ‘ definitive answer ’ as to where the picture was being stored			0
the @entity3 sat for @entity4 twice at @entity11 in 2005 , with the oil , which took two months to complete , finally being unveiled around the time of her landmark birthday the following year			1
in it she can be seen wearing an emerald green dress , her favourite pearls and a brooch made to mark her late mother ’s 100th birthday			2
the presenter personally unveiled his finished work to the monarch in the @entity50 and later boasted about how she had been ‘ very friendly ’			0
his efforts were filmed by the @entity6 and shown in a special edition of his programme , @entity54 critics lambasted the portrait as ‘ amateurish ’ - singling out her toothy grimace and awkward hands for particular scorn - but the palace duly hung it for a few months in the @entity62 , which is open to the public , as part of their 2006 summer opening display			2
it was handed straight back to the @entity6 afterwards , in around october of that year			2
a royal source said last night : ‘ it was commissioned by the @entity6 for the @entity3 ’s 80th birthday and was returned to the @entity6 – end of story			1
’ the portrait never belonged to the @entity3 and was never gifted to her			0
there was , however , a great deal of interest around the painting and the programme that accompanied it which is why it was displayed in the @entity62 for a short period			0
‘ it was handed back to the @entity6 afterwards and we have n’t seen it since			2
’ but a spokesman for the broadcaster told the @entity84 in a statement yesterday : ‘ we have been asked about this before and out position has n’t changed			0
the @entity6 does not have this painting in its collection			1
’ landmark : the shamed star , pictured arriving at @entity11 , was commissioned to paint the queen to mark her 80th birthday remarkably , given that the @entity6 used public funds to commission both the portrait and programme , a spokesman added : ‘ it was commissioned by us … but i ca n’t speculate as to where it may be			1
’ enquiries have since revealed that the painting was put out on loan again to the @entity102 in @entity103 in 2012 as part of a wider exhibition of paintings by @entity4			2
later that year , it seems that it was handed back to @entity109 , which is understood to deal with the sale and display of all @entity4 ’s personally - owned paintings			1
callers to the firm – which has more than 25 branches across the country and sells work by @entity118 and even , bizarrely , @entity119 - were last night asked to send in their questions by email			0
at the time of going to press , the @entity84 had not received a response			0
intriguingly , while internet searches still show several historic links between @entity4 and @entity109 – he frequently appeared at promotional events for the firm around the country as well as having his artwork sold by them – all references to him appear to have been deleted from their website			1
one source in the art world suggested last night that mr @entity4 may have taken the portrait back for his personal collection			0
whether that was simply for sentimental reasons or that he had an eye on selling it should he have been cleared of the charges he now faces jail for , may never be known			0
the only certainty is that it is unlikely to ever hang in public again .			0
