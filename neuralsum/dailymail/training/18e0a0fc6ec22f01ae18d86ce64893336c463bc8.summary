by @entity0 for @entity1 it looked like spring had come early for @entity4 tennis in mid-february , the spirits buoyed above all by an away @entity8 victory over the @entity9 which put @entity10 in the @entity12 quarter final for the first time in 28 years			1
@entity18 looking on the mend following back surgery , @entity21 returning , @entity14 seemingly poised for the top 100 , a new man at the helm of the @entity16 – revival was in the air			1
yet this @entity23 has been a reminder that tennis in @entity27 ’s host nation rarely takes two steps forward without taking at least one and a half back			1
@entity18 has reached the last 16 , but there were no qualifiers , the country ’s two female entrants failed to win a set while @entity35 – unbeknown in february - is likely to miss the rest of the season as she works her way back from wrist surgery			1
better times : @entity18 ( left ) congratulates @entity41 on his @entity8 victory in @entity43 in february disappointment : @entity21 was knocked out in the first round of the @entity23 at @entity45 the men ’s doubles players , a source of low - key success for the past few years , failed to win a match between them			1
with poignant timing it emerged that @entity53 , junior winner at @entity45 just three years ago , is considering his future in the game			1
now there are big changes afoot at the @entity16 , going well beyond the recently - announced shift of emphasis to the @entity60 at @entity61 , which will become more a junior training base and less of a centre for elite training squads			1
according to one insider at the governing body , ‘ everything is up in the air ’ , with coaches being warned that they need to have a ‘ @entity68 ’ in case they are released			0
some staff are being told to reapply for their jobs while others are being made redundant			0
employees in the regions are fearful too , as the axe is set to be wielded on many of the 19 ‘ @entity79 ’ which for so long have failed to live up to their titles			1
morale is said to have reached a new low			0
uncertain : @entity53 , the 2011 @entity23 junior champion , is considering his future in the sport @entity87 @entity86 is now , in earnest , starting the changes he promised since taking over from @entity90 , who grew the organisation to more than 300 employees but with little to show for it in terms of participation or elite performance			1
@entity90 got many things wrong , although it has been incorrectly reported that he is to blame for the £ 40 million blown on building @entity61 , which he had the foresight to oppose			2
he also spotted the potential in @entity103 as @entity8 captain , but @entity86 is now trying to reverse many of his more damaging strategies , aided by veteran @entity107 coaching guru @entity106 , who has been brought in as @entity108			2
@entity86 and @entity106 worked together when the former ran @entity110 and are both proper grown - ups at 57 and 61			2
although they have affable exteriors they have already shown a ruthlessness that , while inevitably painful for some , is probably necessary to try and turn around a sport that has been underachieving for decades , despite the odd spell of optimism such as last february			0
@entity106 , with a huge list of individual coaching credits to his name such as @entity123 , is a formidable taskmaster and will demand the highest standards			0
in charge : @entity87 @entity86 took over from @entity90 as @entity16 chief executive in january it will be fascinating to see how he views players like @entity14 , who has genuine talent but struggles to come to terms with the demands of the modern game			1
@entity14 , who will be back down below 250 after losing in qualifying here , has gone in and out of the @entity16 giant tent over the years and is a reluctant traveller			2
there has been a desperation to provide assistance to help keep players like him going , because the alternatives are so sparse and , in his case , he has also put in some fine performances for the @entity8 team			0
the fact is that come a week on monday the only @entity4 male within a country mile of @entity18 will be @entity41 , who has had a good season to get within sight of the top 100 , and more definitive decisions may be taken on whether to maintain support for other players			2
on a similar theme @entity106 also has to weigh up the policy on wildcards at @entity4 tournaments , which for so many years have been distributed with little coherent strategy			0
the effect has sometimes been to temporarily inflate home players ’ rankings , but some international research suggests they are counterproductive in the long run			0
drop : @entity14 ' loss in @entity23 qualifying means that he will now be ranked below the 250 mark arguably more worrying is the lack of obvious male prospects in the @entity10 junior ranks , which is highlighted again in this week ’s event for under - 18s at the @entity23			1
talent identification systems are another area rightly under examination			0
the in - trays of @entity86 and @entity106 overflow , with some of their remedies for the long - term malaise expected to be more solidly outlined in the next two months			0
another development to look out for is the possible switch to @entity4 nationality of @entity189 , the longtime @entity185 - based @entity184 ranked 133			0
but it is only more success with the home - grown players that can prevent another @entity23 like this one .			0

there were no @entity4 qualifiers at the @entity23 this year
both @entity21 and @entity200 failed to win a set in @entity202
@entity53 , the 2011 @entity23 junior champion , is considering his future
@entity16 chief executive @entity86 is now starting the changes he promised after taking over from @entity90
