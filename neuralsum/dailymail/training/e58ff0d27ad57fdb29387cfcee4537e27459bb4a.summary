@entity0 yesterday tried to defend his decision to pose for a light - hearted ‘ selfie ’ in the middle of @entity6 ’s memorial service – by claiming he was only being polite			1
the prime minister attempted to laugh off the storm of criticism he provoked after larking around with @entity10 and @entity12 ’s prime minister , @entity11			1
he joked he was being ‘ polite ’ by agreeing to pose for a picture with @entity14 , the glamorous daughter - in - law of former @entity17 leader @entity16			0
perhaps in my defence , you should always remember that the television cameras are always on			2
‘ but in my defence i would say that @entity6 played an extraordinary role in his life and in his death in bringing people together			2
' so of course when a member of the @entity16 family asked me for a photograph , i thought it was only polite to say yes			0
' deputy prime minister @entity58 also came to mr @entity0 's defence today			1
@entity0 cuddling up to the glamorous @entity12 prime minister and @entity10 for an impromptu ' selfie ' was a sight to behold get in shot ! ms @entity11 , who is @entity16 's daughter - in - law , pulls mr @entity0 into the frame president @entity10 and @entity12 prime minister , @entity11 chat during the ceremony mrs @entity11 then points out something of interest in the order of service they then share a joke during the poignant memorial to @entity6 mr @entity0 said he was just being polite in agreeing to the selfie , because he was asked by a member of the @entity16 family the smartphone used in the selfie appears to be a @entity80 , the company 's larger 4.2 - inch touchscreen handset , which came out in march this year			1
judging by the way @entity12 prime minister @entity11 is holding the camera , the snap would have been taken using the handset 's front - facing @entity87 camera - a high resolution for a front - facing lens , but not the best choice when taking a selfie with the leader of the free world			1
the back lens offers a far superior quality - an @entity98 camera complete with auto - focus and auto - stabilisation functions that would avoid any blur when focussing in on one of the three recognisable faces			0
miss @entity11 could have also zoomed in on the faces with the 3x digital zoom to really highlight the cheesy grins being shown off at the time			2
after having taken the photo , she may have used the phone ’s built - in camera app , or downloaded a selfie app such as @entity112 , which would have let her add fun frames to the pictures			2
miss @entity11 would have also been able to share the image instantly using her @entity117 contacts on the @entity119 operating system			2
speaking on his radio phone - in on @entity121 , mr @entity58 said : ' i know some people are n't happy about it			1
i think it was a bit of friendly light - hearted joking around by the three of them			1
i personally do n't feel that people should be too censorious about it at all			0
' he added : ' it was a very celebratory atmosphere , it was a real celebration of the man 's life			0
there was dancing , there was singing , the crowd was in a very jubilant mood			0
' so it was n't as out of keeping with the setting as i think some people have suggested			0
' a photo of the incident at @entity147 ’s @entity146 quickly went viral and featured on front pages on both sides of the @entity150 yesterday			1
the @entity151 described it as a ‘ funeral faux - pas ’ , while a poll for the @entity12 newspaper @entity155 found that two - thirds of @entity12 felt posing for a jokey picture at a funeral was ‘ inappropriate ’			1
the @entity160 political commentator @entity159 said : ‘ why do @entity0 and @entity10 feel the need to behave like idiots ? ’ @entity163 also appeared deeply unamused , staring stonily ahead while the three world leaders joked around			1
in a comment on @entity168 , the @entity166 mep @entity165 said : ‘ one person in that image retains her dignity – @entity172			0
’ the photograph provoked scathing criticism on social media , with many users saying it was inappropriate for world leaders to joke around at an event to mark the death of one of the great statesmen of the 20th century			2
twitter user @entity183 wrote : ‘ what selfish morons take a “ selfie ” at a memorial service ? oh yeah that ’s right , @entity10 and @entity0			1
’ in a message directed at mr @entity0 , @entity188 said : ‘ you have precisely zero class or decorum			1
’ miss @entity11 is married to @entity193 , the son of former @entity160 @entity17 leader @entity16 ( right ) @entity195 said the event was ‘ a celebration of mr @entity6 ’s life ’ rather than a funeral			1
@entity201 photographer @entity200 , who took the now infamous photograph of the three leaders , acknowledged they were ‘ messing about like kids instead of behaving with the mournful gravitas one might expect ’			0
but he defended their behaviour , saying he felt they were ‘ simply acting like human beings ’ , given the ‘ carnival atmosphere ’ inside the stadium			0
tens of thousands of @entity214 filed past @entity6 ’s embalmed body as he lay in state in @entity217 yesterday			2
his body was surrounded by flowers , and dressed in one of his trademark colourful shirts			0
huge crowds began forming in the early hours of yesterday , with the line stretching 2km through the streets			0
many mourners waited for at least four hours in the baking sun. politicians , celebrities and mr @entity6 ’s family had all paid their respects before the public were allowed in			1
the group included mr @entity6 ’s widow @entity234 , his former wife @entity235 , @entity214 president @entity236 , @entity238 singer @entity237 , @entity240 dictator @entity239 and supermodel @entity235 , who wiped away tears and had to be comforted after viewing mr @entity6 ’s body			1
@entity11 was previously given a warm welcome by @entity0 ( below ) when she visited @entity245 on her first official to @entity247 as @entity12 prime minister in november 2011			1
as the daughter - in - law of former @entity17 leader @entity16 , it was joked that a @entity16 had finally managed to get a foot inside @entity195			0
her father - in - law famously lost to @entity254 's conservatives in the 1992 general election after leading the polls for months			2
while he blamed sustained personal attacks on him by the press , critics said voters were turned off by @entity17 ’s tax plans and his premature triumphalism at a @entity264 party rally			0
there had been fears that his son @entity193 's wife could suffer from the same ' @entity16 curse ' in the lead - up to polling day			2
and indeed she was forced to dismiss allegations that she had separated from her husband and that he was gay right before her general election			0
@entity12 prime minister @entity11 speaks during a meeting with @entity277 president @entity10 at the @entity278 in february last year but it did not stop her sweeping to victory to become @entity12 's first female prime minister in september 2011			1
during her time in office , she has also visited @entity10 at the @entity278 in february last year			2
dubbed a ' @entity284 diva ' for her penchant for designer clothes , she led a ' red bloc ' of parties to oust centre - right @entity289 from office			0
stylish : @entity11 has been dubbed a ' @entity284 diva ' for her penchant for designer clothes miss @entity11 , 46 , gained a master 's degree in political science from @entity297 in 1994			1
two years later , she married @entity193 , 42 , whom she met in @entity298			0
they have two daughters - @entity301 , 16 , and @entity302 , 13			0
