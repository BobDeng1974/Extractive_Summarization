reflecting on his work as the first minister ’s bodyguard , mr @entity7 said : ‘ it was a bit unusual			2
i had just returned from @entity66 , where i was evacuating @entity68 peace - keepers on behalf of the @entity69			2
‘ the situation over there was tough			0
there ’s still a huge amount of ordnance – shells and missiles which @entity77 left behind – so it was dangerous 24 hours a day			0
‘ @entity79 made the decision to pull us out , so i was helping with evacuations , and i was among the last to leave			0
it was quite hairy and a few vehicles were shot up			0
‘ my wife suggested , because i ’d had a couple of close shaves , that i should perhaps find more suitable work in @entity13			0
thanks : a letter sent to the bodyguard by @entity3 after his stint working for her in @entity30 ‘ when i got home , the company i work for got in touch and asked if i was free to do some work for mr @entity10 and i was very happy to do it			2
‘ i ’m not doing it for the money – i wanted to make a contribution to @entity13 political history			0
