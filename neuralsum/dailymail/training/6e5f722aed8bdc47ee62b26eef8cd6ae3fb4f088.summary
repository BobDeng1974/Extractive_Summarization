@entity0 will be forever associated with the @entity1 after his part in @entity4 ’s legendary win against @entity5 in the 2005 final			1
@entity0 came on as a half - time substitute with @entity4 trailing 3 - 0 and is credited with helping their remarkable comeback as @entity10 ’s side fought back to draw 3 - 3 and win on penalties			1
with the 2015 @entity1 knockout stages due to begin this week , @entity0 — also a @entity15 @entity14 finalist in 2002 — casts his eye over all the ties with reporter @entity18			1
@entity19 ( right ) celebrates scoring the final goal as @entity21 win the 2014 @entity1 @entity22 ( left ) was part of @entity4 's famous comeback against @entity5 in 2005 @entity25 v @entity26 tues , feb 17 7.45pm , @entity27 @entity28 and @entity26 know what the @entity1 is all about			1
@entity28 has won it with @entity31 and @entity32 and @entity26 lifted the trophy three years ago			1
they know what it takes get a result in @entity38 and finish the job off at @entity40			2
i am yet to be convinced by @entity25 , it takes more than buying quality players to win the @entity1 and they are not proven at this level			1
it ’s amazing that @entity46 has n’t won the competition and @entity48 will be the centre of attention against his former club			0
winners : @entity26 the @entity1 is one of the few trophies that has so far eluded @entity25 striker @entity46 @entity55 v @entity54 tues , feb 17 7.45pm , @entity56 1 this tie would have been hard enough for @entity55 anyway but it has been made even tougher by having to play their home leg in @entity60 because of the troubles in @entity62			1
however , @entity54 have won only one in five matches in @entity65			2
i expect @entity67 to be the key			0
he has been the top scorer in @entity70 for the past 18 months , @entity69 has n’t hit the ground running after his move from @entity73 and @entity75 ’s injuries have limited his playing time			0
winners : @entity54 in - form @entity67 ( left ) holds the key to @entity54 's success in the @entity1 @entity81 v @entity21 weds , feb 18 7.45pm , @entity56 5 @entity82 scored twice at @entity81 last season when @entity21 won 6 - 1			1
i find it strange he is n’t loved by @entity21 fans because i do n’t think he could have done more for them			0
@entity81 have done well since the mid-winter break and will fancy their chances at home , particularly after signing @entity90 on loan			0
he ’s a good defender and i was surprised he did n’t feature more at @entity93			1
@entity81 manager @entity94 knows how to cause a @entity1 shock but even so the holders have so much quality			1
winners : @entity21 it is incredible that @entity21 fans have criticised @entity82 at the @entity101 this season @entity102 v @entity31 wed , feb 18 7.45pm , @entity56 1 i was impressed by @entity102 when i saw them knock out @entity4 in the group stages			1
they have some good young players — defender @entity108 is outstanding , @entity109 is a proper midfielder and @entity110 is still doing a job at 33			0
@entity31 are opponents that wo n’t suit them			0
they have a lot of power in their team and , with goalscorer @entity120 , they might be too powerful			0
winners : @entity31 @entity31 forward @entity120 could pack too much power for surprise package @entity102 @entity124 v @entity73 tues , feb 24 7.45pm , @entity56 1 a fascinating tie			0
i fancied @entity73 when the draw was made but have changed my mind as they are struggling in the @entity130 , while @entity124 are dominating @entity131 and have some great players , such as @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			0
@entity73 have saved their best for @entity137 but recently their priority has been the league because of the relegation danger			0
too many players have been out of form			0
winners : @entity124 @entity135 ( centre ) will be hoping @entity124 ' domestic domination can extend into @entity137 @entity93 v @entity146 tues , feb 24 7.45pm , @entity27 1 @entity146 have started to fire while @entity93 have been so inconsistent , drawing 1 - 1 at home to @entity149 and then winning 4 - 1 at @entity150			1
@entity93 will take heart from last season , when they took @entity146 to the wire at the @entity154			1
but @entity146 have so much @entity137 experience on their side			1
it will be @entity158 ’s first game in @entity159 since he left @entity4 and he has found it difficult in @entity161			2
he was the boss at @entity4 and that suited him , whereas that is not the case at @entity146			1
it has n’t really worked out for him and there is every chance he will leave this summer			0
winners : @entity146 @entity158 ( centre ) will be playing in his first game back in @entity159 since leaving @entity4 for @entity146 @entity171 v @entity170 weds , feb 25 7.45pm , @entity56 5 i expect big things from @entity171 , they are capable of beating any team on their day			1
if only they ’d break the bank for someone like @entity179 from @entity180 and they would be serial trophy winners			0
a lot of people would like to see @entity184 have a proper run in this year ’s competition and they have the best possible draw			0
although @entity170 did well to win their group , they are not the team that spent big money on @entity194 and @entity195			2
if @entity171 have anything about them , they have to get through this game			2
@entity199 is key and can turn matches like this			2
winners : @entity171 @entity171 playmaker @entity199 's sublime skills are tailormade for the @entity1 stage @entity207 v @entity205 wed , feb 25 7.45pm , @entity56 1 @entity205 were so close in the final against @entity21 last year			1
everyone seemed to think they would fade away this season but it has n’t happened			0
i ’m impressed at how @entity214 has got @entity215 going again			0
@entity215 has been woeful for three years , and i always felt the only place he could rediscover his form was at @entity4 or @entity205			2
@entity218 did n’t start too well after the mid-winter break in @entity15 but their @entity221 star @entity220 is now back from the @entity222			2
they have missed him but @entity205 are so well - oiled and hard to break down			0
winners : @entity205 @entity225 is showing more of the sports that matter including the @entity1 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , the @entity230 and @entity231			1
former @entity26 flop @entity215 has discovered a new lease of life since returning to his home club			2

@entity1 last 16 matches begin on tuesday *february* 17
of the @entity227 sides remaining @entity26 face @entity25 , @entity171 host @entity170 and @entity93 meet @entity146
former @entity4 star @entity242 gives his *verdict* on the games
