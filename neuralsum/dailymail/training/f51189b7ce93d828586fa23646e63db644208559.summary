by @entity0 published : 07:36 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 07:41 est , 12 june 2012 a busy mother of two has invented a back - to - front rucksack that acts as an extra pair of hands to help multi-tasking parents			2
@entity6 , from @entity7 , had got used to cooking with one hand while loading the washing machine with the other , but she was certain there was an easier way			1
so the ingenious 43 - year - old came up with the ' @entity14 ' , a simple but effective bag that straps on to the chest of overstretched mothers and fathers			1
too many demands : @entity6 invented the @entity14 after she found she had her hands full when trying to cook , clean and keep control of her children @entity23 , seven , and @entity24 , eight the cheerful printed leaves harassed mothers and fathers them hands - free to cook , clean or look after children while carrying washing , books or stray toys			1
now no matter how many discarded items mrs @entity6 collects as she does the housework , she is ready for any emergency , and the clever rucksack even prevents any strain on the back			1
mrs @entity6 is now selling the rucksack online and has been granted a @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , which protects her design from duplication within the @entity45			1
' i found at the end of the day i was almost crippled after spending all day looking after two young children , picking up toys , washing clothes and it got to the point where i could n’t take it anymore , ' said mrs @entity6			2
' i looked around for something that could help me , something i could attach to me like a backpack but be able to reach more easily			0
the 43 - year - old can now store toys and washing in the back - to - front bag as she goes about her daily business pulled in all directions : mrs @entity6 found it tough to cope with all the demands on her time when @entity23 was born and @entity24 was just one ' i looked everywhere and could n’t find anything suitable , so i decided to invent what i needed			1
' i have had a fantastic response and i have sold 20 in my first two weeks and that ’s just through word of mouth			0
' mrs @entity6 , who lives with it expert husband @entity71 , 46 , and their two children @entity24 , eight , and @entity23 , seven , developed the idea after tying a bedsheet to her chest to help with the housework , following encouragement from her friends and family , she experimented with different designs and different material , using old backpacks for fabric , buckles and netting			2
she hit on the winning idea earlier this year and has now found a manufacturer to finish her product to a professional standard			0
all business : the pouch of the bag is positioned high up to prevent any strain on the back - and it is already proving a hit online the pouch sits high up on the body , to save the constant bending and lifting associated with washing bundles of children ’s clothes			1
mrs @entity6 added : ' i spent a long time testing different ideas and showing them to my husband and he would tell me if he liked them and if he did n’t			2
' the pouch is especially useful for people with back pain			1
i spoke to some medical experts who said the best place for it would be high on the chest which limits the movements you have to take and it is also better for your posture			0
' i hope the invention will help people like me , mothers and fathers			0
i have also used different material such as oil cloth and nylon to be used outdoors			0
' ' i have never done anything like this before but i felt it was something that i needed so i am very pleased with the result			0
' i have even made a smaller one that fits a child of about 10 so mothers can get their children involved in helping around the house			0

made from old rucksacks with pouch positioned high up to reduce back pain
