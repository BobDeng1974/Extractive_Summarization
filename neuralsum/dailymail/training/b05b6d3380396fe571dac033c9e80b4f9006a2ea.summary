by @entity0 published : 16:15 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 21:44 est , 29 september 2013 @entity4 is preparing to launch a @entity6 printer into space next year , a toaster - sized game changer that greatly reduces the need for astronauts to load up with every tool , spare part or supply they might ever need			1
the printers would serve as a flying factory of infinite designs , creating objects by extruding layer upon layer of plastic from long strands coiled around large spools			0
doctors use them to make replacement joints and artists use them to build exquisite jewelry			0
in @entity4 labs , engineers are @entity6 printing small satellites that could shoot out of the @entity30 and transmit data to earth , as well as replacement parts and rocket pieces that can survive extreme temperatures			1
made in space : project manager @entity37 , left , and director of research and development @entity38 test a 3d printer which will eventually be used in space ‘ any time we realize we can 3 - d print something in space , it 's like @entity50 , ’ said inventor @entity42 , who is consulting with @entity4 on the project			1
‘ you can get rid of concepts like rationing , scarce or irreplaceable			0
’ the spools of plastic could eventually replace racks of extra instruments and hardware , although the upcoming mission is just a demonstration printing job			1
‘ if you want to be adaptable , you have to be able to design and manufacture on the fly , and that 's where @entity6 printing in space comes in , ’ said @entity61 , director of engineering at @entity4 's @entity62 at @entity63 , about 35 miles south of @entity64			1
for the first 3 - d printer in space test slated for fall 2014 , @entity4 had more than a dozen machines to choose from , ranging from $ 300 desktop models to $ 500,000 warehouse builders			1
test run : tools and parts made by a 3d printer are displayed			1
one of the biggest obstacles to space exploration is that you need to bring everything with you including tools , equipment , spare parts and satellites all of them , however , were built for use on @entity88 , and space travel presented challenges , from the loads and vibrations of launch to the stresses of working in orbit , including microgravity , differing air pressures , limited power and variable temperatures			1
as a result , @entity4 hired @entity102 startup @entity101 to build something entirely new			2
‘ imagine an astronaut needing to make a life - or - death repair on the @entity108 , ’ said @entity104 , ceo of made in @entity105			1
‘ rather than hoping that the necessary parts and tools are on the station already , what if the parts could be @entity6 printed when they needed them ? ’ when staffing his start up in 2010 , @entity104 and his partners warned engineers there would be ups and downs - nauseating ones			1
in more than a dozen flights in @entity4 's ‘ vomit comet ’ reduced - gravity aircraft , @entity101 scientists tested printer after printer			1
ready for launch : @entity104 , ceo and co-founder of made in @entity105 , looks through some items			2
specialized 3d printers would allow astronauts to produce the things they need on - demand when they 're in space , allowing them to travel farther from the @entity88 last week at their headquarters on @entity4 's campus , made in space engineers in lab coats and hair nets tinkered with a sealed @entity6 printer in a dust free cleanroom , preparing the models for further pre-launch tests			1
as proof of its utility , the team revisited the notorious 1970 moon - bound @entity148 breakdown , when astronauts were forced to jerry - rig a lifesaving carbon dioxide filter holder with a plastic bag , a manual cover and duct tape			2
a 3 - d printer could have solved the problem in minutes			1
‘ safety has been one of our biggest concerns , ’ said strategic officer @entity158			0
sparks , breakages and electric surges can have grave consequences in the space station			2
‘ but when we get it right , we believe these are the only way to manifest living in space , ’ he said			0
space - bound printers will also , eventually , need to capture gasses emitted from the extruded plastics , be able to print their own parts for self - repairs and have some abilities to recycle printed products into new ones			2
@entity183 , who helped develop @entity6 printing technology in 1988 by making a toy frog for his daughter with a glue gun in his kitchen , said he never conceived how pivotal it could be for space travel			2
but he said that until metal becomes commonly used in @entity6 printers , the applications will be limited			0
‘ the good news is that you do n't have to have this huge amount of inventory in space , but the bad news is now you need materials , in this case filament , and a lot of power , ’ he said			0
@entity4 and other international space agencies are pressing forward with 3 - d printing			1
mastering space manufacturing , along with finding and producing water and food on the moon or other planets , could lead to living on space			0
last month , the space agency awarded @entity213 , @entity214			0
- based tethers unlimited $ 500,000 toward a project to use @entity6 printing and robots to build massive antennas and solar power generators in space by 2020			2
it replaces the expensive and cumbersome process of building foldable parts on @entity88 and assembling them in orbit			0
for made in @entity105 's debut , when it 's shuttled up to the space station aboard a spaceflight cargo resupply mission , the initial prints will be tests - different small shapes to be studied for strength and accuracy			1
they 're also discussing with @entity4 about what the first real piece that they should print will be			0
whatever it is , it will be a historic and symbolic item sure to end up in a museum someday			0
‘ it 's not something we 're discussing publicly right now , ’ said ceo @entity104			0
then , @entity245 , the chief technology officer , beckoned , dropping his voice as he grinned			0
‘ we 're going to build a @entity251 , ’ he joked softly , referring to the giant space station in the ‘ @entity250 ’ movies that could blow up planets			0
‘ then it 's all going to be over			0

@entity4 plans to launch a 3 - d printer to the @entity108
the tool will let astronauts replace lost or broken items
launching spares takes up space and adds *weight* to launches
printer will be ready in june for a @entity267 mission to the station
the printer will be used to make tools and parts
inventor : 3 - d printing in space is ' like @entity50 '
