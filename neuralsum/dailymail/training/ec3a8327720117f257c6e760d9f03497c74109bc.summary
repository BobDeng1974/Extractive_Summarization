multi-millionaire @entity0 is by many measures the most impeccably bred landowner in the country a few miles outside @entity3 , on the banks of the river @entity6 in the heart of @entity9 country , sits a spectacular @entity11 mansion called @entity12			1
in 40 acres of parkland and filled with suits of armour , oil paintings and a selection of resident ghosts , the stately home is the family seat of 58 - year - old @entity0			1
you probably have n't heard of mr @entity0 , a tall , somewhat shy accountant with a wife and four children , who inherited a large tranche of @entity26 on the death of his father , @entity28 , in 2009			1
this unassuming multi-millionaire is by many measures the most impeccably bred landowner in the country			1
a cousin by marriage to @entity35 , he is almost the only person in @entity36 whose can trace his lineage back to the @entity38 by uninterrupted male descent			1
@entity41 's paternal ancestors have managed to hold land continuously in the ' manor ' where @entity44 stands for almost a thousand years			1
so evocative is the family history that @entity9 , an occasional house - guest at @entity12 , wrote gushingly about ' the spirit of valiant @entity41 '			1
today , some 400 years later , talk of that ' valiant ' spirit brings a wry smile to the lips of local people			1
for @entity0 finds himself at the centre of a very public skirmish			1
it revolves around some six acres of farmland that he owns on the edge of @entity12 , a couple of miles from the family seat			2
this site — a field crossed by a well - trodden footpath , with views of the @entity65 — is the subject of a fierce planning dispute			1
@entity41 , in partnership with a building company , plans to develop it to create several dozen ' executive ' homes			2
ill - feeling over the proposal has united the local community in opposition			1
more than 400 people — one for every house in @entity12 — have filed written objections to it			2
many see it as emblematic of a wider national malaise			2
for as the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) revealed this week , a staggering 729,000 homes are to be built on greenfield sites such as this			2
almost 200,000 of those will be on supposedly protected @entity90 land			2
the front view of @entity12 , which sits on the banks of the @entity93 in the heart of @entity9 country the battle has not just divided the village but caused tensions among the members of @entity41 's immediate family			1
indeed , i understand that his wife , @entity104 , is vehemently opposed to the development			2
the trouble here began last year , when @entity0 struck a multi-million - pound deal to allow a developer , @entity110 , to build 80 homes on the field , which has been in his family for generations			1
locals , when they found out in september , were outraged by the project , which would increase the size of the pretty village , which has two pubs and one shop , by a fifth			1
they held angry public meetings , signed petitions , met politicians			1
after a planning application was submitted last month , they began bombarding @entity3 - upon - @entity129 's district council with complaints			1
the village is dominated by banners and signs opposing the proposed estate , claiming that it will increase traffic , destroy a well - used footpath and place an intolerable strain on the local school			1
' it 's the scale that is so outrageous , ' says @entity141 , the leader of @entity142 , a lobby group with 200 local members opposing the development			2
' @entity3 council have said our village should have no more than 50 new homes between now and 2031			2
' this will give us 80 in one go , in a highly visible spot			2
it will rip the heart out of our community			2
it just makes my blood boil			2
' much personal anger is directed at @entity0 himself			1
' we never thought the @entity161 would do something like this , ' says @entity164 , 56 , whose grandmother , a parlourmaid , was one of many locals who worked at @entity12			1
@entity12 residents against the proposed development in the village			2
@entity141 , left , @entity171 and @entity172 are pictured in the foreground ' they have always run the village so we never thought they would do something to ruin it , especially when they already have so much money			2
' hostilities nearly spilled over at the @entity183 pub last month when @entity142 held a quiz night to raise funds to oppose the development			0
@entity41 had agreed to attend the event as a guest of @entity189 , a local agent for the @entity190			0
however , a few hours before it began she was advised not to attend due to the ' level of hostility ' her presence might generate			0
an organiser tells me : ' it was for her own safety			0
' i understand that mr @entity0 has not actually sold the field yet , but instead granted @entity110 a legally binding ' option ' to buy it , for several million pounds , provided planning permission is granted			1
but details of the deal are hard to ascertain			0
when a local newspaper got wind of it , mr @entity0 not only refused to comment but even refused to confirm that he owned the field			1
@entity206 documents confirm that it belongs to a family trust based in the @entity209 for tax purposes			0
he did not respond to the @entity212 's requests for comment			0
' a lot of this is about class , ' said a source close to the family			0
' people always want to blame the landowner , but new homes have to go somewhere and half of these villagers who so oppose the development live on an estate built 15 years ago			0
that makes them hypocrites as well as @entity228			0
' if they owned a field and were offered a chance to turn it into a few million quid , i bet they 'd accept			0
' when i called at the farmhouse where the @entity236 live ( these days they lease @entity12 to a luxury hotel chain ) , @entity104 also declined to discuss the affair			0
the area 's @entity190 mp , @entity240 , who backs the project 's opponents however , a friend of mrs @entity41 told me that her sympathies lie with the villagers			0
she was said to be ' very cross ' about her husband 's decision and ' feels passionately ' that planning permission should be refused			0
' @entity0 signed this silly deal without telling @entity104			1
he 's a greedy clot for doing it and she is very , very cross about it , ' said the friend			0
sir @entity254 , mr @entity0 's uncle , is a wealthy businessman married to @entity35 's aunt @entity255 , although friends deny that the landowner has a close relationship with the pm			1
' i believe two branches of the family fell out years ago when @entity0 , or one of his close relatives , was n't invited to @entity35 's fifth birthday party			1
@entity266 though it seems , they 've barely spoken since			0
some extended family members now wo n't vote @entity190 , ' says one			0
as regards the planning battle , though , similar disputes are playing out across rural @entity270 thanks to the housing boom , a loophole in planning regulations and the incompetence of more than half of our local authorities			0
in at least eight villages around @entity3 , developments of between 20 and 100 homes are mooted			0
locals are calling it ' a battle for @entity9 country '			1
some of the building applications go back to 2010 , when the government altered planning law to require every local authority to create a ' core strategy ' outlining where an allotted number of new homes should be built in the coming years			0
it was decreed that , if no such plan was in place , home - builders who were refused planning permission for a project but appealed against that decision to central government would be likely to gain automatic consent			1
the rule was supposed to encourage local government bureaucrats to create housing plans promptly			0
but three years after it came into operation , 178 of the country 's 327 district councils still have n't managed to complete their ' core strategy ' — temporarily giving developers @entity312 to build on almost any rural land they can buy			1
as the @entity85 revealed this week , 38 major developments , involving 8,700 new homes , were given the green light on appeal last year			0
most were in the constituencies of @entity319 , leading some to wonder if anger over the issue could cost the party marginal seats at next year 's election			0
' there are lots of @entity190 landowners benefiting from this planning loophole , ' says @entity141			1
' they all have connections to the party and many of them are donors			0
' which is awkward for the area 's @entity190 mp , @entity240 , who backs the project 's opponents			0
the other day mr @entity240 , a no 10 policy adviser , published an open letter to the government calling for the loophole to be closed			0
it declared that the ' physical harm ' being done by ' rapacious developers ' threatens ' to become the defining legacy of this government '			0
for the longer the loophole remains open , the angrier the voters of @entity350 , and many other villages , will surely get .			0

@entity0 finds himself at the centre of a very public skirmish
he is one of the most impeccably bred landowners in the country
but ill - feeling over the proposal has united locals in opposition
