controversy : thirteen cabinet ministers could face bitter rows over fracking in their constituencies , it emerged last night			0
police are pictured escorting a lorry past protestors at a proposed fracking site in @entity30 , @entity31 while the firms can not go ahead with fracking before seeking permission from the local council , it raises the prospect of more fierce protests from residents concerned that it carries environmental risks and will destroy the countryside			1
there have been angry clashes between campaigners and riot police at @entity30 in @entity31 , where exploratory drilling started last week			0
other members of the @entity48 who have seats in the @entity50 , where limestone rocks are believed to contain a plentiful supply of gas trapped thousands of feet underground , are justice secretary @entity54 , culture secretary @entity55 , science minister @entity56 , chief whip sir @entity57 and @entity58 , a cabinet office minister			0
environment secretary @entity59 has joined mr @entity10 in championing shale gas and both have constituencies within the @entity64 shale area in northern @entity20			1
hot spots : this map shows the constituencies of cabinet ministers which could face rows over fracking the constituencies of foreign secretary @entity72 and minister without portfolio @entity73 also fall within its boundaries			0
according to the @entity76 , it could have reserves of up to 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas – enough to power @entity79 for decades			1
mr @entity10 has said that it would be ‘ a real tragedy ’ if @entity79 did not capitalise on this source of energy			0
‘ it would mean we would have much higher energy costs than other countries , it would mean jobs would go to other countries and we would lose out , ’ he said			0
@entity90 , which is carrying out the drilling in @entity30 , began fracking in @entity93 three years ago			2
other fracking firms , including @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , have licences for unconventional oil and gas in other areas of the @entity103			1
potential battle : companies involved in shale gas drilling have exploration licences in areas represented by chancellor @entity10 , left , and education secretary @entity14 , right @entity109 , which is opposed to fracking , used maps of shale resources produced by the @entity113 to compile a list of ministers who stand to be affected by the industry			1
its energy campaigner , @entity117 , said : ‘ @entity118 have thus far been the most vocal cheerleaders of fracking			0
it will be very interesting to see if the ministers who have talked up shale gas will be so happy when it ’s in their backyard			1
‘ they are beginning to recognise that they could pay a price at the polling booth if they lend their support to it			0
tricky : foreign secretary @entity72 , left , and health secretary @entity15 , right , could also face battles in their constituencies ‘ @entity30 is just the beginning – people wo n’t take the disruption to their communities and countryside lying down			0
’ the @entity138 revealed earlier this year that 35 @entity140 @entity139 have constituencies in areas that could be licensed for fracking			1
@entity109 ’s research shows several marginal seats in shale - rich areas , including four held by the @entity118 and two by the @entity13			2
deep divisions have emerged within the @entity149 over fracking , which involves pumping water and chemicals at high pressure into bore holes to crack open the shale rock and release trapped gas .			2
