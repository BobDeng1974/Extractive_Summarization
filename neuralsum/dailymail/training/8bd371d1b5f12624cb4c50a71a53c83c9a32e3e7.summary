by @entity0 a woman who suffered from a rare condition which made her grow into a 6ft 11ins giant has died suddenly at the age of 34			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , spent the last 12 years trying to find a cure for her acromegaly , which meant she could n't stop growing			1
until the age of 21 , @entity5 was just 5ft 8ins tall and weighed 130lbs			1
she rode horses , went dancing and had a boyfriend			0
by 2010 ( right ) , she was 6ft 6in and more than 400lbs			0
she died suddenly today at the age of 34 an inspiration : @entity5 celebrates her 34th birthday with a friend on november 27 , 2012 struggle : miss @entity5 has died at the age of 34 after her heart failed due to her extreme size but a tumour became wrapped around her pituitary gland , causing massive amounts of growth hormone to be released into her body			1
@entity5 , who became wheelchair - bound , had the most extreme form of acromegaly ever seen , growing to nearly 7ft tall , and more than 400lbs			1
ms @entity5 , who had been working as a supervisor at a @entity33 in @entity34 , was fired from her post when her condition worsened , and was dumped by her boyfriend when his parents questioned whether she was a man			1
but she never gave up searching for a treatment to halt her incredible growth and hoped she could one day have a more normal life			0
in august last year , it seemed like @entity5 and her family had finally seen a breakthrough , when a blood test revealed that her growth hormone levels had fallen at last			1
@entity5 's mother @entity48 said at the time : ' for the first time ever , @entity5 's blood level for her disease is in the normal range			1
' it gives us renewed hope and will give other people renewed hope			0
' sorrow : a message was posted on @entity5 's website that she had sadly passed away on january 14 new treatment : the 34 - year - old was given renewed hope for her condition last year but it was not to last the good news was short - lived			1
@entity5 's insulin - like growth factor levels , which had fallen from 3,000 at the worst of her condition to just 283 , had started to creep back up into the 500 's			2
the normal range for a healthy person is around 250			0
it is thought the extreme pressure on her body , caused by 12 years of coping with her huge size , caused her heart to fail			2
acromegaly , which affects 20,000 people in the @entity78 , is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumour on the pituitary gland			2
ms @entity5 had undergone radiation and surgery three times in an effort to have hers removed , but , as it is wrapped around her carotid artery , it has proved too difficult			2
if left untreated , acromegaly can be life - threatening , as it causes organs such as the heart and lungs to grow along with height and weight			2
sufferers are at higher risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure , while the pressure on their joints causes swelling and early onset of osteoarthritis			0
a notice on @entity5 's website , which has inspired and helped acromegaly sufferers around the world , reads simply : ' it is with deep sorrow that we announce the passing on of our beloved @entity5 at 12.25am on january 14 , 2013 , due to her heart and @entity110			1
rip dear one ' @entity110 ( @entity110 ) is a type of mini-stroke , caused when the blood flow to the brain stops for a period of time			1
@entity5 had suffered a number of @entity118 in recent years			1
describing her acromegaly last year , @entity5 said : ' sometimes i feel really down about it but to me the most important thing is that i have to tell people about it			1
' i read emails that people send in saying : '' you 're my inspiration , '' or , '' you are so strong			0
'' ' if i am helping other people , i feel i can do anything			0
' @entity5 , whose condition caused her to spend many hours sleeping , found her outlet through her website , which helped her gain friends around the world			1
last year , she was able to meet some of them for the first time at an @entity137 in @entity6 , where fellow sufferers told @entity5 how hearing her story had caused them to seek early treatment , and possibly saved their lives			1
during the last 12 years , @entity5 underwent three operations to attempt to remove her tumour , but several different surgeons were unable to reach part of the growth , as it was wrapped around her inner carotid artery			2
her heart , lungs and the joints of her limbs continued to grow as she gained weight and height , causing huge strain on her body			2
change : photographs of ms @entity5 ages 17 ( left ) and 31 ( right ) reveal how acromegaly has affected her face healthier times : before her acromegaly diagnosis , ms @entity5 was a keen horserider her mother @entity163 and stepfather @entity164 continued to search for new ways of tackling her condition , and last year doctors finally agreed to double the dose of @entity5 's growth inhibitor medication , which was administered by painful injections into her spine			1
the treatment seemed to finally be working , until the sad news in october that her growth hormone levels were rising again			0
@entity5 , talking in 2009 about the slow onset of her growth said : ' i could n't understand why , as i was n't eating more			2
what was strange was that my feet seemed to grow as well			0
my face also started to swell and was changing			0
' i felt unhappy with my appearance and spent a fortune on make - up			0
my figure also started to change and become more manly and my voice became deeper			0
' the 34 - year - old , who loved jewellery and enjoyed regular swimming sessions which helped her body feel weightless , continued to remain hopeful throughout her life			0
' without hope you do n't have anything , ' she is quoted as saying			0
' i hope they can stop me growing one day			0
