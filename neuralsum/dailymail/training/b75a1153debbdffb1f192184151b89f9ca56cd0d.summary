@entity1 's @entity0 will take a three - shot lead into the final round of the @entity4 on sunday as he seeks his first @entity6 title			1
@entity0 , mentioned as a potential future @entity8 player by @entity10 captain @entity9 last week , carded seven birdies and one bogey in a third round of 64 to finish 14 under par at @entity15			1
@entity17 's @entity16 , who won a year 's supply of beer for a hole - in - one on friday , is his nearest challenger on 11 under after a 65 , with @entity23 's @entity22 another shot back after equalling the day - old course record with a 62			1
@entity0 leads the @entity4 by three shots after a round of 64 on saturday @entity0 has been earmarked as a potential star since winning on the @entity28 as a 19 - year - old amateur in 2010 , but told @entity30 : ' i 'm not really affected to be honest			1
i know if i play good enough i am going to win one day ; maybe it 's going to be tomorrow , maybe it 's going to be in two years , i do n't really know			1
' the most important thing for me is to play some good golf			1
i am not in the top 100 in the world ( he is currently 125th ) so i ca n't play the best tournaments like the majors and @entity40 events , so i am just trying to improve my game week after week			1
' i am confident and even if i do n't win tomorrow it 's not a big deal , it will have been a good week for me and i am going to try to keep doing exactly the same			1
' @entity16 , who held the halfway lead in the @entity46 last week before fading to eighth place , said : ' my attitude pleased me today			2
i nearly got a hole - in - one on 11 again			2
it was playing tough , a front pin and it was a seven iron to four feet , so three shots in two days on the hole is a good effort			2
' i 've been working on the mental side and being a bit more patient , and i 've worked on the short irons			2
i was making too many mistakes			2
i 've started making birdies now			2
it was a small change but it has worked			0
' i 'm in a lovely position			0
the golf course played great again			0
it 's getting bouncy and favours shotmakers			0
i need the same attitude tomorrow , so i 'm hoping to go out and enjoy it as you do n't get this sort of opportunity all the time			0
' @entity22 had the chance to celebrate the recent birth of his first child by carding the first ever 59 on the @entity6 , the former world number three carding nine birdies in his first 16 holes after starting from the 10th			1
@entity22 equalled the course record and sits in the group chasing the young @entity1 a par on the eighth left @entity22 needing to eagle the ninth to create history and he was only a fraction away as his ball pitched close to the pin and span back to miss the hole by a few inches			1
unfortunately the spin then carried the ball off the green and led to a first bogey of the day , but @entity22 had no complaints after matching @entity97 's course record from friday and moving into contention for a first win of the season			1
' i actually was n't thinking about what i was shooting , but apparently came quite close to shooting a 59 on the last , ' the 37 - year - old said			0
' the disappointment was making a bogey on the last , not in missing out on a 59			0
i 'm just happy i 'm playing some good stuff			0
' becoming a father just a few days ago , i 'll be honest and say this probably is n't the most important thing right now and is n't my immediate focus , or all of my focus			0
@entity97 of @entity112 hits his second shot from the rough on the eighth hole ' there have been times the last few days i would rather have been at home , but although i will be committed tomorrow , i will maintain that carefree attitude			1
whether i win this golf tournament or not , i 'll get to go home to my new baby			0
' @entity97 started the day two clear of the field and appeared to be making serene progress as he followed six pars with a birdie at the long seventh			0
however , an errant tee shot at the short eighth found thick rough and led to a quadruple - bogey seven , the @entity127 eventually signing for a 75 to fall nine shots off the lead .			0

@entity0 hits 64 in third round and is closing in on maiden title
youngster has been mentioned as a future @entity8 star
@entity22 equals course record and is in the group chasing @entity1
