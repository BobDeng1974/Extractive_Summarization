by @entity0 the mental state that contributed to @entity2 turning into an @entity4 extremist was left untreated for most of his stint in prison for terrorist activities and this only escalated his condition , according to his former psychiatrist			1
@entity2 is wanted by the @entity12 for alleged terrorist activities in the @entity14 after he fled the country in december on his brother 's passport			1
an oversight by the then - @entity19 meant the 33 - year - old father - of - five , from @entity21 , did not receive any treatment for his mental health issues until mid- 2008 , just months before he was released from jail in 2009 , according to the @entity25			1
in 2005 , psychiatrist @entity43 - a renowned psychiatrist who sits on the @entity45 - assessed @entity2 's condition and discovered the jihadist had depression , acute schizophrenia , paranoia and had suffered from hallucinations for a number of years , with signs of mental illness showing as early as the 1990s			1
this emerges after @entity2 recently shared a photo of his young son , believed to be seven years old , holding up a severed head on social media , which attracted widespread condemnation			1
a judge residing over @entity2 's case had said his mental issues had driven him to jihad			2
it was heard in court his mental issues had ' predicated him towards extremism and radicalisation by others ' , the @entity25 reported			0
the picture of @entity2 's son caused widespread outrage , attracting comments from @entity72 to @entity74 secretary of state @entity73 but leaving him ' languishing ' without treatment for all those years had done him more harm , dr @entity43 said			2
' there was ample documented evidence of pre-existing mental illness that would have been exacerbated by a lack of treatment when incarcerated , ' he said			0
in 2009 , justice @entity82 said corrective services were too slow in responding and only reacted after ' a good deal of prompting '			0
but when treatment started for @entity2 he did recover for a bit but reverted back to his old ways when he stopped taking medication and returned to seeking out other @entity4 extremists			0
the latest controversy @entity2 has stirred up involves a photo posted on @entity92 last week of his son holding up a severed head , along with a caption : ' thats my boy ! ' it was accompanied by a photo of @entity2 himself holding the same head , written with the words : ' what a head ' , and another of him and three young boys brandishing rifles			1
the photos caused widespread condemnations from @entity72 ( left ) and @entity74 secretary of state @entity73 ( right ) the photos sparked worldwide condemnations from @entity42 prime minister @entity72 and @entity74 secretary of state @entity73			0
@entity72 said photographs such as this one highlighted the ' barbaric ' nature of @entity112 , which he said was trying to establish a ' terrorist state ' in @entity114			0
' i believe there are more photographs in the newspapers in @entity42 today of the kind of hideous atrocities this group is capable of , ' he said			0
mr @entity73 echoed mr @entity72 's comments , saying : ' this image , perhaps even an iconic photograph ... is really one of the most disturbing , stomach - turning , grotesque photographs ever displayed , ' mr @entity73 told reporters			0
' of a 7 - year - old child holding a severed head up with pride and with the support and encouragement of a parent , with brothers there			1
' that child should be in school , that child should be out learning about a future , that child should be playing with other kids - not holding a severed head and out in the field of combat			2

the 33 - year - old did *n't* receive treatment for his mental state until mid- 2008
his former psychiatrist said he had suffered from illnesses since the 1990s
the then - @entity19 was slow to get him care , according to a judge
@entity2 was jailed in 2005 after he was found guilty of terrorist activities
