last week @entity0 took the modelling world by storm with her surprise return to the catwalk , after a six - year hiatus following the death of rumoured boyfriend @entity7			1

the model , who was named as the top ten highest earning model by @entity32 in 2007 gave birth to her first child , a daughter named @entity36 , last year			2
' i just felt really pleased for her			2
it was an important thing for her to come back : she loved modelling , she loves fashion and it just was the right time			1
' ' i 'd spent a very anxious week leading up to it			2
the fashion industry is very fickle and you never really know			2
' @entity46 's return to the modelling world had been highly anticipated since she signed back on to the books of agency @entity50			1
the @entity52 beauty has been modelling since she was 15 , and was reportedly paid $ 20,000 per catwalk at the height of her career , walking for iconic brands including @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
at the time of @entity7 's death , the pair were reported to have been dating , and @entity46 was seemingly shaken by his sudden demise from an accidental drug overdose			1
' there was no one like him and no one will ever be like him			0
' i 'm just so grateful i got to meet him and get as close as i did with him , ' @entity46 said of @entity7 @entity46 took ' a break from the media spotlight for the past few years and it was something spurred by @entity7 's death			1
' ' ( @entity7 and @entity79 ) first met in @entity80 and we were both struggling with things that i wo n't get into , and we bonded over that , ' @entity46 told @entity85 ' there was no one like him and no one will ever be like him			1
' i 'm just so grateful i got to meet him and get as close as i did with him			0
' for @entity46 , retreating from the world of modelling was a ' reassessment of everything ... a commitment to myself to address some things that were coming up to do with @entity7 's passing and also things that were troubling me before we met			1
' ' so it was a retreat from many things in my life and i did think it was important for me to focus on those things			0
' ' i did n't know how long it would take			0
i did n't know if it would solve anything , but i set out to focus inside myself			0
' despite the pain of losing @entity7 , the model 's mum knew it was only a matter of time before the flawless beauty was back			1
' if the fashion industry embraces her like it did before , and if @entity0 can work in a way that has some balance with family life and it does n't get too frantic , i think it would be amazing , ' said the model 's mother despite the pain of losing @entity7 , the model 's mum knew it was only a matter of time before the flawless beauty was back			1
' she got to see that if she chose to she could have a very normal life , ' mrs @entity10 said			0
' i always knew she wanted to go back - she had unfinished business			1
it was kind of hard leaving when she did , she needed to go and spend some time for herself			0
' the model , who was named as the top ten highest earning model by @entity32 in 2007 gave birth to her first child , a daughter named @entity36 , last year			0
' she 's always been very professional and now she 's an adult , she 's a mother and i think she really has grown into someone who can see the value of her work , ' mrs @entity10 said			0
' if the fashion industry embraces her like it did before , and if @entity0 can work in a way that has some balance with family life and it does n't get too frantic , i think it would be amazing			0
' ' i think she has a voice now , she 's a mature woman and is able to say no. ' @entity46 's return to the catwalk saw many in the industry excited ' the industry tells you that the life of a model is very short and you have to say yes to everything and , unfortunately , that 's why girls maybe do things that they would n't do if they sat back and thought about it			1
' since retiring in 2008 , @entity46 has appeared in several films and plays , including a role in @entity154 - winning film @entity153 , @entity155 : on @entity156 , and @entity158 's @entity157			1
' it 's nice to be in a position where you can pick and choose , which i think @entity0 's been able to do			0
she 's said no to an awful lot in the last number of years , ' said mrs @entity10			0
' her partner ( model @entity165 ) had never been to @entity167 before and it was his birthday the day before ( the show ) , so she said ' even if it does n't come off it 'll be a beautiful experience for @entity165 on his birthday '			0
' @entity172 , director of @entity174 's @entity173 , who first signed @entity46 in @entity52 , said she was ' very excited '			2
