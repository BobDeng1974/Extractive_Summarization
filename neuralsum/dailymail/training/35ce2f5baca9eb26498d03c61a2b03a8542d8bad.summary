@entity0 are to raise concerns over @entity3 ’s dual interest in the @entity5 club and @entity6 with government sports minister @entity7			1
the supporters group will write to the @entity9 and ask local politicians to raise the matter in the @entity12			1
they will also lobby the @entity14 , @entity5 and @entity15 over fears @entity0 or @entity6 could potentially be excluded from @entity18 competition for a season under @entity21 regulations			1
@entity3 owns @entity0 and also has a stake in @entity24 giants @entity6 the @entity25 have already charged @entity3 with breaches of their rules on dual ownership , with a hearing due to commence on january 27			1
and @entity0 ’s supporters trust believe their owner is in further danger of breaching article three of @entity21 regulations on the integrity of competitions			1
those ban any club participating in a @entity18 competition from having any influence ‘ either directly or indirectly ... in the management , administration and / or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a @entity21 club competition ’			0
suspected of having pushed for the appointment of @entity46 as @entity6 chief executive at @entity48 , @entity3 has yet to respond to the challenge to his powerbase by former director @entity51 and a second group of supporters , the so - called ‘ @entity58 ’ , who have separately purchased blocks of shares representing 31 per cent of the club			1
@entity6 chairman @entity59 ( left ) and non-executive director @entity46 ( right ) but @entity60 of the @entity0 declared the latest front in a long - running war of attrition with the man blamed for saturday ’s @entity66 defeat to @entity67 by telling @entity68 : ‘ @entity21 ’s article three , regarding the integrity of the competitions , is clear cut			2
‘ read through that and you see that the rules definitely catch @entity3 out			0
‘ he owns 100 per cent of @entity0 and just under 10 per cent of @entity6			1
‘ and he has the merchandising operation , is a major creditor and has tried to tie up various naming rights deals			0
‘ i do n’t think anyone would argue that @entity46 is also his appointment as chief executive at @entity6 and has arranged for two directors to be removed from the board			0
@entity0 are to raise concerns with government sports minister @entity7 ‘ so we do n’t think any reasonable person can dispute that he has a substantial interest in @entity6			1
‘ as a consequence of that he has dual interests in two clubs and once @entity6 recover from their current situation and get back to where a club of their status should be they will definitely be competing in @entity18 competition			2
‘ and the likelihood is that would be in the @entity97 to begin with where they might meet @entity0 because @entity3 ca n’t compete with @entity100 , @entity101 or others			2
‘ because of that we have drafted letters to the secretary of state for sport , the @entity5 , the @entity14 and the @entity15			0
those will be going out next week			0
‘ we will also be approaching some local mps we have good relations with and we will be asking them to raise this issue with the secretary of state for sport in the @entity12			0
second - placed @entity6 are 13 points adrift of @entity114 at the top of the @entity116 ‘ if we do n’t get anything from that we will then write to the sponsors of these competitions asking if they are aware that what they are buying is being sullied by the fact either @entity0 or @entity6 wo n’t be able to compete			2
‘ the product of footballing being a sporting enterprise is being potentially sullied by @entity3 ’s dual interests			2
the @entity25 had led the way on this and we await their judgment later this month with some interest			0
’ @entity0 have denied any potential future breach of @entity21 rules on dual ownership , banning a newspaper which put the specific concerns to @entity21 ’s governing body in september .			0

@entity0 owner @entity3 owns a stake in @entity6
but fans are concerned about issues relating to dual interest
a supporters group has turned to a government minister for help
@entity7 is the @entity9
