@entity1 striker @entity0 has warned that recent injury problems will not stop him having a @entity3 to remember			1
@entity4 has disappointed at recent major tournaments and heads in to tomorrow night ’s opening group b game defending champions @entity9 having recently suffered a groin problem and having escaped with minor cuts following a collision with a kite surfer on a @entity15 beach			1
but the @entity17 star claimed today he is ready to go , saying : ' i should n't even mention my groin injury , frankly			2
' i 'm ready for it			2
besides , i 've been playing six years with aches			2
i 've had to learn to do that			0
' i 'm positive for everything that lies ahead and have faith in our team			0
' the @entity24 are preparing for their final games under coach @entity23 before he leaves to join @entity4 as his new manager at @entity1			1
playmaker @entity38 suggested this week that the @entity22 are more together under @entity39 than they were under @entity40 when they lost the last @entity41 to @entity9 in 2010			1
and @entity4 struck a similar note ahead of @entity22 ’s official pre-match press conference later today			1
he said : ' do not underestimate us , even though @entity9 are a great team			1
all smiles : @entity9 should beware according to @entity0 who says he feels it will be a good tournament frustrating : @entity4 ( left ) endured a difficult season at @entity17 under @entity49 ( centre ) ' in my view they are the best team in the world			1
but we are also very good			0
' of course , we have to prove ourselves again , but it is also a great challenge			1
we will therefore give it everything			0
' our focus is good and it has to be			0
what you saw in the past often , is that in the beginning , many jokes were being made			0
i think that 's less the case now			0
' we are looking forward to it and are really eager to get started			0
' and if we - and i mean not only the players but also the staff and the press - can say that we 've had a good tournament , whatever the outcome , that for us will be a success			0
' celebrate : @entity4 hopes to be celebrating with @entity23 ( right ) after the @entity3 finals			2
