the @entity15 and @entity16 , a collaboration between qualified medical doctor and nutritionist dr @entity20 and fitnessontoast.com exercise blogger @entity22 , takes the faddiness out of the equation and instead recommends eating carbs , feeling full , drinking caffeine , enjoying hot chocolates and not over-exercising			1

and all this without a gym membership or hours on the treadmill			0
' countless hours of fruitless training can often often drain you of the very energy you 're looking to capture , ' explains @entity22 , who has 30,000 followers on her @entity40 account			1
instead @entity22 recommends body weight training , which uses your own body weight for strength exercises			1
' body - weight training is fantastic for strengthening and sculpting the body , ' she says and all you need to start is an exercise resistance band , which retails from Â£ 2			1
the 28 - day programme also includes ' brutally focused cardio ' as well as stretch days and rest days			0
in any one week , the plan recommends three 30 - minute body - weight training days , two rest days , one stretch day and one ' hit ' day of high - intensity cardiovascular exercise			1
a ' hit ' involves sprinting for one minute followed by a minute rest for 20 - 30 minutes			0
the body - weight circuit consists of five different exercise to be done for one minute each with a two - minute rest at the end , repeated six times			1
as well as creating a toned physique , @entity22 explains , ' an increase in muscle mass will speed up the metabolism even whilst at rest '			1
' the thermogenic effect [ increased body heat ] that happens after a solid workout will compound this metabolic boost , ' she adds			2
nutritionist dr @entity20 believes in eating carbs at every meal : ' the elimination of entire food groups , calorie counting and complicated instructions result in eating becoming a chore rather than a pleasure ' the programme also includes a daily meal plan of breakfast , lunch and supper as well as two daily snacks , but dr @entity20 ( founder of thefoodeffect.co.uk ) has a holistic food philosophy			1
she believes in enjoying food and making sure you 're never too hungry are essential elements of a healthy eating plan			2
' the focus of a diet should not only focus on what to exclude , but more importantly what to include , ' she says			2
' the elimination of entire food groups , calorie counting and complicated instructions result in eating becoming a chore rather than a pleasure			0
the end result is inevitable , " when can i come off the diet and eat all the things i miss ? " ' she also believes we should eat slowly to enjoy the experience			2
' focus on the food you 're eating and do n't just wolf it down , ' she says			0
dr @entity20 says drinking coffee and even enjoying a mug of hot chocolate are good for you ' do n't eat dinner in front of the tv or lunch in front of the computer			1
take time out to enjoy your meal and actually pay attention to what you 're eating			0
' taking down the pace also helps to prevent over-eating			0
' eating slowly will also ensure your brain registers you 've eaten enough food ... before it 's too late ! ' she says			0
carbs at every meal , drinking coffee and even enjoying a mug of hot chocolate arealso on teh meal - plan agenda			2
' do n't shun carbs but instead stick to wholegrain , unrefined carbs such as oats , whole - grain bread , brown rice , sweet potato and quinoa , ' she advises			0
dr @entity20 , founder of @entity148 ( left ) and fitnessontoast.com exercise blogger @entity22 ( right ) who wrote the guide ' slow release carbs will give you the get - up - and - go you need to stay active and keep your metabolism burning strong and steady			1
' whilst excess caffeine is obviously no good , caffeine from good quality coffee is packed full of antioxidants and has been shown to have tremendous health benefits , ' says @entity20			2
' it has also been shown to boost performance when exercising if drunk before a work - out			0
' dark chocolate ( with fruit ) or a hot chocolate make a regular appearance as an evening snack in the meal plan			0
