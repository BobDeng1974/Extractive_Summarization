by @entity0 published : 16:25 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 02:10 est , 3 august 2013 with its girlish gossiping about handsome men and parties , it is a classic example of an exchange between young women			2
the writer talks of her heart ‘ fluttering ’ at the sight of a ‘ devastatingly attractive young giant ’ of an officer , and her embarrassment at busybodies listening in on her chat at parties			0
but the signature at the bottom , ‘ @entity20 ’ , gives a clue that it was not written by any ordinary young woman			0
@entity23 : a series of items , including @entity27 letters written by a young princess @entity28 , have been released			1

right , the @entity28 in a lemon gown , with diamonds in her ears and around her neck , dances with commander @entity35 at the @entity36 in @entity37 in 1951 the author was none other than princess @entity28 , writing at the tender age of 19 in the months following the end of the @entity42 – only seven years before she would become queen			1
the carefree tone of the note , to her ‘ darling ’ cousin @entity46 , is in stark contrast to the gravity of the role fate was preparing for @entity28			2
@entity20 – then her pet name among the family – writes excitably about dances , weddings and men , saying she has not been ‘ doing badly in the way of fun ’ and has been ‘ greedily ’ taking opportunities to socialise at @entity59			1
inner thoughts : the signature at the bottom of the letter ' @entity20 ' reveal the identity of its author she reveals that one of the royal family ’s protection officers is ‘ a devastatingly attractive young giant ( with fair hair and blue eyes , of course ) from @entity74 called @entity75 ! ’ she adds : ‘ he caused my @entity83 ’s ( her sister ) heart to flutter a bit , i think ( mine too , a bit )			2
’ to her cousin , who was in @entity86 working with the @entity87 for the @entity88 when @entity28 wrote the letter in november 1945 , she notes that ‘ you must have fun with all your generals ’ and have ‘ made the acquaintance of a good many of the species ’			2
the letter , on six sides of @entity98 - headed notepaper , has come to light as part of a sale of about 400 items related to @entity104 ’s royal children , to commemorate the birth of @entity106 , called two centuries of @entity108			1
@entity28 also gossips about the wedding between @entity110 , 4th @entity111 and @entity112 , saying it was ‘ a tremendous affair '			2
‘ there must have been at least 500 people			0
it became so packed that one could n’t move without some horrid old lady listening to what one said to every man one met ! ’ at the time , the young princess had already fallen for @entity121 , whom she would marry two years later			1
but she seemed to still have half an eye on plenty of other young men			0
taking a more serious tone , @entity28 says that with her cousin in ‘ a place like @entity86 , one is grateful for any small thing , and when one thinks of how much one grumbles back here , then we all ought to be ashamed of ourselves ’			0
she also bemoans the fact her friends keep being posted overseas : ‘ it ’s a great pity so many people who one just got to know have all departed for @entity136 or @entity86 , so one has got to begin all over again			0
’ sombre : appearances suggest not all of the young princess ' encounters were an emotional roller coaster			1
