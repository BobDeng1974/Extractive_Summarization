@entity0 understands just how difficult it is now to hold down a place in the @entity4 side , who he says have been the ' best team in @entity7 ' this year and could lift the title next season if everyone stays fit			1
the @entity12 ' slim hopes of overhauling @entity14 's 10 - point lead at the top of the @entity16 were all but extinguished following a goalless draw at the @entity18 on sunday			1
@entity0 watched on from the bench again before a late substitute appearance , with the forward 's last club start having been back in march			2
@entity0 believes @entity4 have been the ' best team in @entity7 ' in the second half of the season @entity4 had earned eight successive @entity16 victories before the 0 - 0 draw against @entity14 the 26 - year - old - who recovered from a serious knee injury last season , but has yet to agree a new long - term deal - feels such strength in depth can only be positive for the squad , if sometimes frustrating for individuals			1
fellow @entity36 internationals @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 also did not make the first xi against @entity14			0
' there is a lot of competition for places so everyone seems to lift a gear and play extremely well			0
it makes it a bit more difficult for people to get into the team , ' @entity0 said , quoted on the club 's official website , www.arsenal.com			0
' i think , especially this season , not many people thought we would be challenging for the @entity16			1
' in this calendar year , we have been the best team in @entity7			2
' it is the strongest the squad has been and everyone is staying fit as well			0
the @entity64 midfielder ( left ) has struggled to maintain a first team place under @entity66 this season ' there are n't many injuries in the squad , which is important			0
if we had an injury - free season , i think we could lift the title			1
' @entity4 head to @entity73 on bank holiday monday looking to keep pressure on @entity76 in the race for second place , and with it automatic qualification for next season 's @entity81			2
captain @entity83 is set to step up his training this week after an ankle problem hampered recovery from a calf injury , while midfielder @entity88 is another continuing rehabilitation from an inflamed groin which has seen him out since the @entity91 win at @entity92 last month .			0
