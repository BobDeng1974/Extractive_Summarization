protest : @entity0 , shadow secretary of state for international development , says @entity3 players should walk off if they are racially abused @entity3 players should walk off in protest and abandon the match if any of them are racially abused during the @entity8 football competition , @entity4 said last night			1
the unprecedented call for a pitch protest by shadow foreign secretary @entity0 came amid a growing political row over the tournament in @entity13 and @entity14			1
and the view received strong support in a snap poll , which suggested six out of ten backing players who walk off			1
mr @entity0 said that if , as many fear , black @entity3 players are abused when the team plays @entity14 on tuesday week , the match should be stopped – with the points awarded to @entity3			1
@entity14 and @entity13 should face similar sanctions to the sporting boycott of @entity25 in apartheid days , @entity4 added			1
writing in today ’s @entity27 , mr @entity0 argues : ‘ i support referees taking the strongest possible action in the face of racist abuse from the terraces			1
they have the power to stop the game should any racist incidents occur – they should use it and be backed by the governing body			2
‘ however , if a referee ignored blatant racist abuse , and the @entity3 players or their management felt they were justified in walking off , they should be supported in their action			1
‘ if either host country ’s fans misbehave , the teams could be taken off by the referee with the home team forfeiting the points			0
hopefully something like that might encourage players to challenge their supporters			2
’ mr @entity0 also called on @entity52 and the soccer authorities to back @entity4 ’s tough stance : ‘ the @entity56 government should send a clear signal to @entity58 that it wants racism to be dealt with swiftly and robustly			2
’ he was backed by fellow @entity4 front bencher @entity60 who said that as well as calling off matches , all @entity14 and @entity13 players should start the next game with yellow cards to punish racist chants by fans			1
and they should be made to play behind closed doors			0
@entity4 ’s stance is in stark contrast to that of @entity72 , president of @entity58 , @entity75 soccer ’s ruling body , who said players who walk off should be booked			0
the @entity3 team are training at a ground in @entity79 ahead of the @entity8 championship pressed on the race row last week , he brushed it aside saying : ‘ i do n’t think there ’s any more racism in @entity13 and @entity14 than in @entity86 or anywhere else , or even in @entity3			1
it ’s not a footballing problem			0
it ’s a problem for society			0
’ mr @entity0 also accused mr @entity52 of ‘ dithering and delay ’ over his response to the jailing of @entity14 ’s opposition leader @entity95			1
@entity56 ministers are to boycott @entity3 matches in @entity14 in the group stages of the tournament , but have not ruled out attending if the team qualifies for the latter stages			2
members of the @entity3 squad this week visited the factory in @entity13 where @entity105 helped save thousands of @entity106 ‘ if @entity3 go all the way , @entity14 ’s president @entity107 should be left to stand and clap in the vip section alone and not with @entity52 joking and cheering beside him , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
the snap poll which supported @entity4 ’s view also found that only one in five opposed players walking off			2
similarly , half of voters said ministers should boycott all games in @entity14			2
fewer than one in four disagree			0
the @entity119 survey yesterday of 499 people is unweighted , and the figures do not necessarily reflect the views of the population as a whole			0
racism fears : the families of @entity3 players @entity128 , left , and @entity129 , right , have decided not to travel to @entity13 and @entity14 shadow defence secretary mr @entity60 compared the pitch protest plan to the sporting boycott of @entity25 during the apartheid era			1
he said : ‘ there are some who still claim that sport and politics do n’t mix , but they always have done and always will			0
we should celebrate the power of sport to influence societies			0
’ @entity141 last night refused to back @entity4 ’s call for players walking off , insisting it was up to football authorities to decide			0
a spokesman also said there was no change in the ruling on ministers attending matches in @entity14			2
@entity151 marred the opening of @entity8 after @entity154 hooligans attacked stewards at half - time during friday ’s match between @entity154 and the @entity158			0
