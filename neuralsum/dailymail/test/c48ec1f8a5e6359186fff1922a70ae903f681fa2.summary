@entity0 of @entity1 has the power to send sales of high - street designs sky - rocketing , so it 's little surprise that her offspring have the same effect			1
as @entity11 and @entity12 prepare to welcome their second child , there 's no doubt that the royal couple 's favoured childrenswear brands are hoping to cash in on the arrival			0
indeed , if @entity19 's first year - which boosted the economy by £ 247m - is anything to go by , anything that the second - born touches will turn to gold and copycat designs will bring a welcome boost to the high street			1
he said : ' i think there will be an immediate boost of around £ 80m when the baby is born , with around £ 20 to £ 25m spent on souvenirs and the rest on food and drink such as cake and sparkling wine			0
the baby could generate a billion pounds over its lifetime			0
' there is n’t as much excitement when it ’s the second baby , but a girl would have the potential to boost the fashion industry			0
' as well as the boost to baby clothing sales that we have seen from @entity19 , a @entity64 would be able to set trends throughout her life , which will be great for the people who designed her clothes or those who can make quick knock - off copies			1
' the term ' the @entity19 effect ' was coined just three days after his birth when the £ 20 printed white aden + anais cloth in which the @entity1 and @entity11 wrapped their baby son before leaving the @entity79 of @entity80 sold out almost instantly the term ' the @entity19 effect ' was coined just three days after his birth in july 2013 when the £ 20 printed white aden + anais cloth in which the @entity1 and @entity11 wrapped their baby son before leaving the @entity79 of @entity80 sold out almost instantly			1
within 48 hours of being seen for the first time , the £ 44.95 wrap had sold out , while traffic to the brand 's website shot up by 1,960 per cent			0
and it did n't stop there			0
following the family 's portrait for @entity94 in 2013 , when the prince sported a baby blue number with ' @entity19 ' emblazoned on his chest , personalised baby clothes retailer @entity90 sold 1,200 jumpers in just four hours			1
then , the family 's tour of @entity102 and @entity103 in april last year , on which @entity19 played a prominent role , sent brands into a frenzy			2
while most eyes were on the @entity11 's wardrobe choices during the family 's time abroad , she was n't the only royal setting sartorial trends			0
following the family 's portrait for @entity94 in 2013 , when the prince sported a ' @entity19 ' emblazoned jumper , personalised baby clothes retailer @entity90 sold 1,200 jumpers in just four hours much like his mother , @entity19 used his first royal tour to prove he 's quite the trendsetter , with a plethora of stylish outfits			1
designers of the clothes the nine - month - old wore over the fortnight reported a huge surge in sales and the royal tot became something of a fashion icon			1
one such example is the @entity132 romper suit he wore on his arrival in @entity135 - a similar design totally sold out immediately and then had a shipping time of two months			2
the young prince looked dapper in the nautical - style romper suit as he disembarked an @entity102 @entity141 jet			0
he was blissfully unaware of the furore he caused , but within seconds of the royal trio arriving in @entity102 , @entity143 was awash with commentary about his ensemble			0
on a playdate in @entity103 , the tiny tot wore a stylish smocked romper from @entity151 , a @entity43 luxury brand for children , which retails at £ 77 ( aud $ 125 )			0
the family 's tour of @entity102 and @entity103 in april last year , in which @entity19 played a prominent role , sent brands into a frenzy			2
a similar version of the @entity161 romper suit , sold at @entity132 , he wore on his arrival in @entity135 , left , sold out immediately and the @entity151 dungarees , right , sold out in minutes online the classic tailored dungarees with a sailboat smocked design on the front panel sold out immediately in the six month and 12 month sizes on the company 's website			2
the @entity19 's accessories also caused a sales frenzy on the trip			2
stockists of the novelty kangaroo backpack , which the @entity1 was seen carrying after it had been gifted to his son in @entity135 , reported the item had sold out hours after the family 's airport appearance			0
the @entity181 - one of the stockists of the bag - sold out of its remaining stock of the item immediately			1
ceo @entity186 said the sudden rush of orders for the kangaroo bag , which was selling for £ 7 ( aud $ 12.50 ) , was a result of @entity12 seen carrying one			0
photographs released of the young prince wearing an adorable soldier jumper in december last year also sent one high street store into frenzy			1
@entity19 wore a £ 32 @entity32 tank top in his @entity198 snaps last december and , of course , mothers went into a frenzy trying to snap up the royal 's jumper within moments of the photos appearing online , the tills at @entity32 were ringing as parents rushed to get hold of the then 16 - month - old 's £ 32 tank top			1
but as demand skyrocketed , the sailboat - emblazoned top soon sold out - leaving a crowd of frustrated mothers in its wake and gleeful fashion brand executives rushing through a fresh batch			2
then , the knitted tank tops have begun to appear on @entity219 but will cost would - be purchasers far more than they did in the shops			0
ahead of the new royal baby 's birth , brands are already stocking memorabilia			1
indeed , @entity226 , one of @entity11 's favourite shop 's , has launched the @entity229 2015			0
due to the success of the first collection , and inspired by the @entity11 's latest expectancy , the new collection features a moses basket based on the designs store owner @entity235 had while pregnant with her own son , @entity236			2
@entity226 , one of @entity11 's favourite shop 's , has launched the @entity229 2015 inspired by @entity19 @entity238 , said : ' @entity11 has already had a major impact on the fashion market with the dresses that she ’s pictured in flying off the shelves as soon as they hit stores so she ’s destined to have the same effect on the baby wear market , too			1
' when @entity11 was photographed in @entity226 whilst pregnant , interest in @entity250 baskets definitely increased and sales of similar infant beds also boomed			2
' style and brand expert @entity253 added : ' it ’s refreshing to see that he ’s not too trendy he ’s just the perfect @entity257 gent			0
the @entity19 effect is due to him wearing clothes that are not designer labels but are wearable , affordable , on - trend colours and perfect for the royal spotlight			1
' a style icon is someone who creates a trend and with his nautical stripes , dungarees and baby grows with royal blue piping he certainly doing that			0
' and dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog , what @entity19 wore , dedicated to all things baby style			1
but while the @entity11 might still be a dab hand at selling out whatever she wears , even she can not compete with her son when it comes to sheer selling power			0
from £ 44.95 swaddling wraps to knitted tank tops , the royal baby effect shows no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear designers and @entity219 entrepreneurs contemplating another year of buoyant sales to come			1
here 's to a fashionable future for baby number two !			1

@entity32 , aden + anais and @entity295 boosted by @entity19
everything he has worn - and similar designs - sold out instantly
@entity19 effect has boosted high street copy - cat sales
royal baby number two , who is due within weeks , is likely to do the same
