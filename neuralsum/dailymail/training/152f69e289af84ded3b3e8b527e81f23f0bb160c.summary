lost : a boy scout troop on a canoeing trip of the @entity2 were lost all day in an overgrown lake until @entity0 helicopter 's led them back on a route to safety the @entity20 asked the @entity21 for help when searchers could n't locate the troop despite searching for over two hours			1
marine capt. @entity25 says his crew used night - vision goggles to spot the troop in a lake that connects to the river			1
@entity25 says then was able to guide boats carrying sheriff 's personnel to the vicinity , and those boats then escorted the canoes to a landing			1
' the deputies said they knew the @entity38 were lost and were east of the river somewhere , ' @entity25 told the @entity6 ' they had been searching but could n't find them , so they requested aerial support , as it was getting dark			2
' it only took the helicopter crew moments to find the troop after they put on their night vision goggles			1
the troops were hidden behind tall reeds on an overgrown lake			0
' they got themselves pretty deep into the estuaries and could n't find their way back out			0
i can see how someone could easily get lost in there because those reeds are really tall , ' @entity25 said			0
' finding them was actually the easiest part			0
they flashed us with some of their flashlights as well			0
' after locating the troop , the crew hovered over a nearby ridge to let off @entity67 to check on their medical condition			1
' i wanted to make sure everyone was in good health and good condition and that there were no medical injuries that needed to be addressed , ' @entity67 said			2
to the rescue : the troop was saved by the @entity21 troops who wore night vision goggles as they flew a helicopter over the @entity2 looking for the scouts ( stock picture ) ' everybody said they were fine but just a little tired from being lost all day			1
' while @entity67 was doing his well - being check , @entity25 circled the area to find the best place for them to paddle back to the river			1
' when we did find a path for them to leave , the estuary was pretty well enclosed , ' @entity25 said			0
' from the air it was obvious it was a throughway , but from the ground , they probably could n't see that at all			0
' @entity25 flew at a low altitude and dropped biodegradable sticks from the helicopter to the water to show them which way they needed to go			0
@entity67 said he stayed with them to keep them calm			2
' pretty much the whole time i was on the ground with them , it was just keeping them calm and making sure they stayed together , ' @entity67 said			2
' i also instructed the scout masters to have one canoe in front of the group and one in back to make sure everyone got out safely			1
' @entity25 then picked up @entity67 and led the scouts through the reeds by using a spotlight to show where the deputy 's boats were			1
' it was a crew effort			0
it all went pretty smoothly , ' @entity25 said			0
' it was done just like we train			0
' the @entity38 finally met up with the sheriff â€™s deputies who escorted them the rest of the way home while @entity25 and his crew made sure no one was left behind in the dark .			0
