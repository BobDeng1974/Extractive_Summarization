the @entity12 voted 4 - 0 wednesday to tentatively declare @entity15 's 2 - year - old bottling plant a public nuisance			1
if a second vote , scheduled for april 23 , makes the declaration official , @entity15 will have 90 days to stop releasing the spicy smells that neighbors say burn their eyes and throats and make them sneeze and cough			1
if the smells still persist , the @entity24 suburb says it will have the authority to enter the plant , take whatever measures are necessary to kill the odor , and bill the company for its efforts			0
the action on wednesday gives the factory 90 days to make changes to stop the spicy odors that prompted complaints from some residents last fall			1
( @entity0 photo / @entity49 , file ) reaction to the move was swift and heated			0
state sen. @entity54 , who represents the area , advised @entity37 to cool it , saying if the city of 1,400 residents does n't want the maker of arguably the world 's most popular hot sauce , he 's sure there are several other cities in his district that do			1
' i ask that the city of @entity37 reject this inflammatory and unnecessary public nuisance designation and work constructively with @entity15 to resolve these issues , ' he said in a statement			1
the company 's attorney , @entity69 , complained the vote was akin to ' thumbing @entity15 in the eye , ' since it came after he told the city that @entity15 was working with regional air - quality officials on a plan to make the smell go away by june 1			1
@entity37 city manager @entity77 said officials were delighted to hear that , indicating he 's certain everybody will simmer down once they realize the city wants only the smell , and not the company , to go away			2
' obviously this is a council that wants to work with all local businesses regardless of their size , and has never had any interest in having @entity15 shut down or relocating , ' he said			0
@entity77 said city officials plan to work with the company and air - quality officials to ensure @entity15 can get a filtration system in place that will make everyone happy			2
the company opened its $ 40 million bottling plant in @entity37 after it outgrew its old one in nearby @entity97			0
the city says most of the complaints about pungent , spicy smells have come during the last two harvest seasons when as many as 100 million pounds of freshly harvested , red - hot jalapeno peppers were ground between august and october			2
@entity77 said 30 to 35 people have given the city sworn statements that the smell bothers them			0
a couple told city officials the smell made them ill enough that they saw their doctors			0
privately held @entity15 was founded and is still owned by @entity112 immigrant @entity15			0
he began making the fiery sauce in a bucket at his home in 1980 and saw his business take off from there			0
originally a staple in @entity124 restaurants and homes , @entity15 's @entity6 , in its distinctive green - tipped bottles with the rooster on the logo , has spread across all cultures , with people putting it on their hot dogs , tacos , pizza and other foods .			2

@entity37 , @entity2 city council will vote again april 23 on whether to officially give the @entity15 90 days to stop releasing tear - jerking smells
one state *lawmaker* panned the city 's action as an *invitation* for the 2 - year - old factory to take its business and *tax* dollars elsewhere
last year , restaurants across the @entity145 were up in arms when the plant was ordered stop production for 30 days following complaints from locals
