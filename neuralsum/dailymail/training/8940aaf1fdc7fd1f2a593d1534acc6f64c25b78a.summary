by @entity0 published : 16:06 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 16:31 est , 2 august 2013 @entity1 with @entity2 who is seven months old			1
she had thought that radiotherapy would destroy her dreams of motherhood everybody needs good neighbours			1
but in the case of @entity1 , hers went above and beyond the call of duty … and became a surrogate for the child she could n’t have			2
@entity13 offered to help mrs @entity1 after learning of her plight in a doorstep chat			1
mrs @entity1 , 33 , had been diagnosed with cervical cancer and radiotherapy was going to destroy her dream of motherhood			1
her only hope of having a child was to undergo a course of @entity23 with husband @entity24 , 31 , before the treatment and then find a surrogate to carry the embryo			0
mrs @entity13 , a mother of three , happily stepped in and now the @entity28 have been blessed with what they call their ‘ miracle baby ’ , seven - month - old @entity30			1
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ the first thing i said to the consultant when he told me i had cancer was chop my arm off but do n’t tell me i ca n’t have children			1
it was the only thing that was important to me			0
‘ then within a week of being told i would never have children i had found my surrogate			0
@entity2 is a dream baby in more ways than one and is all i focused on throughout my radiotherapy			2
’ the @entity28 , who have been together for three years , had just started trying for a baby in 2011 when @entity1 went for a routine smear test			2
a week later she was told there were some abnormal cells and the following month she was diagnosed with cervical cancer			1
with a great deal of support from @entity48 , a health service where mrs @entity1 worked as a learning and development manager , she had the tumour and surrounding lymph nodes removed			1
but she was told days later that there was a lymph node that had slightly enlarged and she would have to undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy – which would prevent her from having a baby			0
the couple , from @entity59 , were told they could not delay the radiotherapy and try to have a baby first and that their only option was to have one round of @entity23 before the treatment started and find a surrogate mother			0

@entity13 offered to help her neighbour after hearing her plight when chatting on the doorstep mrs @entity1 added : ‘ my friends told me to focus on the treatment and getting better but all that was important to me was having a baby			1
‘ it was frustrating because at that point i had all the right bits to have a baby but every time i went for radiotherapy it felt like it was another step in ruining the chances of me having children			0
‘ i spent the weekend trying to find out about surrogacy but i could n’t find any help and started to think it was more and more uncommon			0
’ on the monday she was stood on her doorstep waiting for a friend to arrive when she started chatting to mrs @entity13 , her neighbour of four years			1
she was outside with her youngest child who was being naughty and jokingly asked @entity91 ‘ do you want her ? ’ mrs @entity1 said : ‘ because of the circumstances i welled up			1
i said i would have her			0
i ended up telling her the news and she said of course i will be your surrogate			0
the couple , from @entity59 , have 12 more eggs frozen so may have another child ‘ i did n’t her expect her to actually do it for us			0
we did n’t know each other too well , we had n’t even been in each other ’s houses			0
’ @entity2 was born five weeks prematurely on january 5 this year after mrs @entity13 was implanted with one of the embryos created by the @entity23			2
she was given the middle name @entity30 – a @entity113 name meaning ‘ miracle ’			0
mrs @entity1 is now clear of cancer and the couple are legal parents to @entity2 , as well as genetic parents			1
the couple have 12 embryos still frozen so have not ruled out having another baby			0
mrs @entity1 added : ‘ for now , just @entity2 is perfect , she ’s beautiful			1
it just shows that if you put your mind to it , anything is possible			0
‘ we were very lucky , @entity13 gave us an incredible gift and we will be thanking her for the rest of our lives			2
