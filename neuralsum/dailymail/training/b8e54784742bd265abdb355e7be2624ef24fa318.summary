' the cheetah population in @entity26 , as well as lions , suffered from a strong impoverishment			1
' the centre started a very special cheetah breeding programme aimed at breeding captive cheetahs for their young to be released into appropriate @entity81 and conservancies around @entity26 where cheetahs once roamed freely but are now at a point of near extinction			1
