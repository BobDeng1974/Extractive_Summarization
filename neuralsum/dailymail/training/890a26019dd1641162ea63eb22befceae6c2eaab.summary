by @entity0 a safe and widely - used arthritis drug stops @entity4 ’s in its tracks , a @entity2 study has found			1
the 20 men and women who were given @entity8 did not descend further into the disease – unlike those who were given a dummy treatment			1
memory , mood and the ability to carry out vital everyday tasks such as washing and dressing were all , on average , stopped from getting worse			0
the results , revealed at a major @entity4 ’s conference and dubbed ‘ quite amazing ’ , are comparable with those for @entity20 , one of the few existing @entity4 ’s treatments			1
a home - screening test is available for to check for early @entity4 's symptoms however , @entity20 and other drugs do not work for everyone and their effects wear off relatively quickly			1
with @entity4 ’s and other forms of dementia affecting more than 800,000 @entity2 and the number predicted to double in a generation as the population ages , @entity27 has described dementia as ‘ the key health challenge of this generation ’			1
a drug already used for something else would be cheaper and quicker to test and get to patients			0
dr @entity39 , director of research and development at the @entity41 , said : ‘ there is a desperate unmet need for new drugs for dementia but we know that getting treatments to market from scratch can cost billions and take decades			2
‘ repurposing existing drugs could see new treatments for dementia available in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost , so it is an opportunity we ca n’t afford to waste			0
’ the study by professor @entity59 , a psychiatrist and @entity4 ’s researcher , focuses on a blood protein called @entity62 , which is key to the pain , inflammation and destruction of the joints in rheumatoid arthritis			1
it is also thought to trigger the death of brain cells in @entity4 ’s – and patients with more of it in their blood do worse than those with low levels			1
@entity8 , which is injected into the stomach or thigh , stops @entity62 from causing damage			1
a safe and widely - used arthritis drug stops @entity4 ’s in its tracks ( file photo ) and given as a weekly jab for six months , it held @entity4 ’s at bay for that time , the @entity83 in @entity84 heard			2
professor @entity59 cautioned that only a small number of patients were treated – but described the results as ‘ quite amazing ’			2
he said : ‘ our results are better than we expected			0
‘ it is the first drug in a long time that has shown such promise			0
’ the professor is now seeking funding for a larger trial			0
many promising @entity4 ’s drugs fail when tested on hundreds and thousands of people ( @entity102 ) but if the drug fulfils its early promise , it could be given to dementia patients in as little as five years			1
so far it has only been given to @entity4 ’s patients for six months			2
but it is hoped that given for longer , it would stall the disease for longer			0
it may even prevent someone with slight memory lapses ever going to suffer full - blown @entity4 ’s			2
professor @entity59 said : ‘ we are not reversing the disease but we may be holding it back , so the earlier we start it the better			0
’ however , he stressed that much more research is needed			0
dr @entity119 , of @entity120 , described the results as ‘ encouraging ’ but cautioned : ‘ we know that clinical trials have a high failure rate and so we need to see @entity8 tested further in larger and longer trials in alzheimer ’s disease			1
’ the jab costs around £ 180 a week			0
however , it is hoped that by the time it is cleared for use in @entity4 ’s , the price will have fallen			2
it may also be available in pill form by then .			0

20 men and women given @entity8 found their symptoms did not worsen
results dubbed ' quite amazing ' at @entity4 's conference
dementia affects more than 800,000 people in the @entity2
