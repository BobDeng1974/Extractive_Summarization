by @entity0 published : 13:35 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 14:00 est , 7 march 2014 the @entity2 on friday found a @entity4 man guilty of sexual assault for poking holes in his condoms before having consensual sex with his girlfriend in order to try to make her pregnant			1
@entity14 's girlfriend , whose name the court has protected , said she had agreed to sex as long as it was with a condom so that she would not get pregnant			2
the country 's top court held 7 - 0 that while she may have consented sex , she had not consented to unprotected sex , and that by poking holes in the condoms first , he had committed sexual assault			2
@entity14 ( right ) poked holes in the condoms because he did n't want his girlfriend to leave him ' we conclude that there was no consent in this case by reason of fraud ... mr @entity14 is therefore guilty of sexual assault , ' chief justice @entity33 and justice @entity34 wrote in arguments joined by two other justices			1
the other three judges came to a similar conclusion by a different legal route			0
the written statement of facts presented by the prosecution said that @entity14 had wanted to get his girlfriend pregnant at the time , in 2006 , in order to keep their deteriorating relationship going			0
her pregnancy did extend the relationship for a short amount of time but she later got an abortion and broke up with him			0
after the couple broke @entity14 told his ex in a text message that he poked holes in the condom			1
' i wanted a baby with you so bad , ' he wrote in the text message , reports @entity61			2
@entity14 committed sexual assault because even though his girlfriend consented to sex , she did n't consent to unprotected sex the complainant ended up pregnant , though it was not clear from the evidence before the court that this was necessarily because of the condom tampering			1
@entity14 , who had been out on bail , will now have to serve an 18 - month prison sentence			0
this particular case was held up against the 1992 case of @entity77 positive @entity76 of @entity78 who had sexual relationships with two women with whom he did n't use condoms nor did he disclose his @entity83 too was found guilty of sexual assault even though the woman tested @entity77 negative			1
he was found guilty because not disclosing his @entity77 counted as fraud			0
similarly , @entity14 's attempt to impregnate his girlfriend was obtained through fraudulent means and therefore criminal .			0

' i wanted a baby with you so bad , ' @entity14 wrote in a *confessional* text message after his girlfriend broke up with him and had an abortion
