a former high school quarterback followed in the steps of one - time pro and college players saturday by suing a sports governing body — in this case the @entity6 — saying it did n't do enough to protect him from concussions when he played and still does n't do enough to protect current players			1
the lawsuit , filed in @entity12 on the same day @entity13 wrapped up its last high school football championship games , is the first instance in which legal action has been taken for former high school players as a whole against a group responsible for prep sports in a state			1
such litigation could snowball , as similar suits targeting associations in other states are planned			0
the lead plaintiff is @entity27 , a star quarterback at @entity28 in @entity29 until 2003			1
he received multiple concussions at the suburban @entity32 school and , a decade on , still suffers frequent migraines and some memory loss , according to the 51 - page suit			1
@entity27 did n't play beyond high school			1
attorneys : @entity38 , left , attorney to @entity27 , a star quarterback at @entity28 in @entity29 from 1999 to 2003 , listens while attorney @entity39 speaks at a news conference ( file photo ) the @entity6 did not have concussion protocols in place , putting @entity27 and other high school players at risk , and those protocols remain deficient , the lawsuit alleges			1
it calls on the @entity49 - based @entity6 to tighten its rules regarding head injuries at the 800 high schools it oversees			2
it does n't seek specific monetary damages			0
' in @entity13 high school football , responsibility — and , ultimately , fault — for the historically poor management of concussions begins with the @entity6 , ' the lawsuit states			1
it calls high school concussions ' an epidemic ' and says the ' most important battle being waged on high school football fields ... is the battle for the health and lives of ' young players			1
in a brief emailed statement , @entity6 executive director @entity70 said he wanted to keep the spotlight saturday on the playoff finals			1
but he said concussion management is ' a top priority ' and that the @entity6 ' will continue to be a leader ' in reducing head - injury risks			1
@entity27 's @entity32 - based attorney @entity38 , who filed a similar lawsuit against the @entity80 in 2011 , provided an advance copy of the new lawsuit to @entity83			2
the college sports governing body agreed this year to settle the @entity80 lawsuit , including by committing $ 70 million for a medical monitoring program to test athletes for brain trauma			0
the deal is awaiting a judge 's approval			0
the @entity6 lawsuit seeks similar medical monitoring of @entity13 high school football players , though it does n't spell out how such a program would operate			1
it contends new regulations should include mandatory baseline testing of all players before each season to help determine the severity of any concussion during the season			2
high school football is n't overseen by a single national body equivalent to the @entity80 , but rather by school boards , state law and 50 separate associations ( file photo ) missing : the lawsuit came as the @entity111 stadium went silent saturday as an announcer called out the name of missing football player @entity114 , pictured , whose mother says he texted her about prior concussions the day he disappeared the lawsuit only targets the @entity13 association			1
high school football is n't overseen by a single national body equivalent to the @entity80 , but rather by school boards , state law and 50 separate associations			1
@entity38 says he intends to file suits against other state governing bodies			0
@entity124 was the first state to pass laws addressing sports concussions in children in 2009 , including by barring concussed players from returning to the same game			2
all 50 states have now adopted such laws			0
but the new lawsuit alleges governing bodies , like the @entity6 , have had patchy implementation of state mandates			2
around 140,000 out of nearly 8 million high school athletes have concussions every year , most of them football players , according to the @entity139			1
some estimates put the number of concussions much higher			2
eight high school students died directly from playing football in 2013 — six from head and two from neck injuries — while there were none last year in college or professional football , a 2014 report by @entity144 says			1
speaking saturday , @entity38 said the legal action was n't intended to undermine @entity156 's most popular sport			0
' this is not a threat or attack on football , ' he said			0
' football is in danger in @entity13 and other states — especially at the high school level — because of how dangerous it is			2
if football does not change internally , it will die			0
the talent well will dry up as parents keep kids out of the sport — and that 's how a sport dies			0
' the lawsuit came as the @entity111 stadium went silent saturday as an announcer called out the name of a missing football player and a police poster seeking information on his disappearance appeared on a monitor			0
twenty - two - year - old @entity114 was the last of 24 @entity184 players recognized before the @entity186 ' game against rival @entity187 on saturday			2
