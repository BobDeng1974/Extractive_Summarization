ever wondered what it would be like to gaze across the surface of @entity3 ? thanks to one photographer , you can - with only a click of the mouse			1
@entity8 spent two weeks creating the interactive image using 407 pictures from the narrow angle and medium angle cameras on the head of @entity15 's @entity14 and a bit of digital retouching			1
' [ the camera ] is only two megapixels , which by today 's standards is not huge , ' he told @entity21			2
' of course , flying these electronic components from @entity23 to @entity3 , and having them survive the radiation and other hazards , means that they were not able to just use off - the - shelf cameras			1
' explore this zoomable panorama image to see what it would be like to stand next to @entity14 on @entity3 @entity14 : @entity3 solar days 136 - 149 in @entity33 @entity8 added the sky and a previous picture of @entity14 to the 90,000 x 45,000 pixel panorama with @entity37			1
earlier this week , @entity15 chiefs were relieved when a computer glitch that had stopped operations for a week was solved , meaning they could get back to examining rock powder found on the planet			2
from april 4 , radio communications between @entity23 and @entity3 will be blocked by the sun , meaning work will be halted again until may 1			2
for now , the £ 2billion six - wheel rover , which landed on the planet in august to begin its two - year mission , will continue to analyse the rock sample , which contains all the chemical ingredients necessary for life			0
@entity8 's panorama uses 407 pictures from the @entity46 's cameras scientists identified sulphur , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and carbon in the powder curiosity drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed in an area known as @entity66 within @entity67			1
they believe that billions of years ago water poured down the rim of the crater and formed streams that might have been up to three feet deep			0
at the time of the discovery project scientist @entity72 said : ' we have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life , that probably if this water was around and you had been there , you would have been able to drink it			0
the £ 2billion six - wheel rover , right , is analysing rock powder found on @entity3 which has been shown to contain all the necessary elements for life @entity86 , lead scientist for @entity15 's @entity87 at the agency 's headquarters in @entity90 , added : ' a fundamental question for this mission is whether @entity3 could have supported a habitable environment			0
' from what we know now , the answer is yes			0
' scientists eventually plan to drive the rover to a three - mile - high mound of what appears to be layered sediment rising from the floor of @entity67 .			0
