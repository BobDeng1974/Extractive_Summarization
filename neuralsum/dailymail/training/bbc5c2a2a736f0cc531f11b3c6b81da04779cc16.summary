an attempt to ban @entity2 bosses from asking employees to hand over their @entity5 login details has been blocked by @entity6			1
a last minute alteration to the controversial @entity8 ( @entity8 ) that would have prevented employers demanding that prospective employees disclose social media passwords as a condition of employment was voted down in the house of representatives			1
the proposal , put forward by @entity17 @entity16 was defeated by a 224 - 189 majority , according to the @entity19			1
invasion of privacy ? an amendment to a new @entity2 bill on cyber attacks aimed at preventing employers asking prospective employees for their @entity5 login has been rejected checking up : @entity8 does nothing to address concerns that @entity2 employers can legitimately ask employees for social media login details as a condition of employment ( file picture ) handing over passwords could legally be a condition of acquiring or keeping a job , said @entity38			1
@entity16 said of his amendment before it was defeated : ' it helps the individual protect his right to privacy and it does n't allow the employer to impersonate that particular employee when other people are interacting with that person across social media platforms			1
he warned of an invasion of privacy and the potential of employers to ' impersonate ' employees online			0
the @entity17 initially proposed the password privacy measure as part of the @entity57 of 2012 and warned that social media users have a reasonable expectation of privacy			1
blocked : the amendment to @entity8 was put forward by @entity17 @entity62 who says that social media users have an expectation of privacy in a statement he added : ' they have an expectation that their right to free speech and religion will be respected when they use social media outlets			1
' no @entity2 should have to provide their confidential personal passwords as a condition of employment			0
' @entity16 faced criticism from bill sponsor @entity80 who claimed that he was trying to kill the act			2
he said that the issue should be addressed in separate legislation			0
but previous attempts to counteract the increasing trend of employers asking for prospective employees social networking login details have failed			2
the @entity89 was introduced to senators and congressman but was not passed			0
the overall act would allow the @entity93 and private companies such as @entity5 to share information with one another should they come under cyber attack			0
but critics of the contentious bill , which initially failed when it was rejected by @entity90 last year , say that it would bypass privacy laws and allow companies to hand over users ' information to the government			0
they claim that it would prevent companies who hand over people 's personal details from facing legal action and effectively justify social media spying			1
but @entity8 recieved support from both @entity114 and @entity115 in the @entity116			2
reassurance : @entity5 told its @entity2 users earlier this month that it has no intention of sharing sensitive personal information although the @entity8 was ratified by the @entity116 , there is a good chance that it could yet fall through			2
@entity8 was also approved by @entity6 in april 2012 , but was rejected by the @entity123			1
the @entity124 even threatened to veto the act at the time			0
republicans @entity80 and @entity128 have once again put @entity8 forward as they say that it is vital that companies have the ability to stop threats materialising in light of an increase in the number of foreign cyber attacks from countries like @entity138			1
@entity5 initially came out in support of @entity8 , but its name has since disappeared from a list of firms fully supporting the bill this time around			0
under threat : @entity8 is aimed at allowing companies to share information to thwart potential cyber attacks and the social networking site vice president of @entity2 public policy @entity149 reassured users that @entity5 has no intention of sharing sensitive personal information with the government			2
he said : ' the overriding goal of any cybersecurity bill should be to protect the security of networks and private data , and we take any concerns about how legislation might negatively impact internet users â€™ privacy seriously			0
' but other big name companies including @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 are in favour of @entity8 .			0
