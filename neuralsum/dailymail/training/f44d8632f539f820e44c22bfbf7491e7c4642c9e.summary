@entity0 's about to gorge itself on turkey , sausages and cheese - but it seems our religious feasts carry a hefty price			1
people of faith are more likely to be obese than the godless , a study has found			0
and with all their hot cross buns and chocolate advent calendars , @entity11 are the worst offenders of all			2
a university researcher examined the body mass indexes ( bmis ) of more than 7,000 people , and found those of believers were almost a point higher than those of atheists			1
sitting comfortably ? people of faith have a @entity17 a point higher than the godless , according to a new study feast : experts believe the role food plays in religious ceremonies could be partly to blame ' evidence of this association was strongest among those affiliated to a @entity35 religion , ' said dr @entity36 , a senior lecturer in dietetics at @entity38			1
' a significantly higher waist - to - hip ratio was also seen in @entity35 and @entity41 men			1
' although religious belief and health have been compared before in the @entity45 , the study is one of the first times the two have been examined together in @entity0			2
writing in the @entity50 , dr @entity36 said she studied 7,414 adults over 16 who were quizzed for the 2012 @entity53			2
she found the @entity17 of those who described themselves as religious were on average 0.91kg per square metre higher			1
only wafer thin : @entity58 may not add much to your waistline , but religion and obesity appear linked people with a @entity17 between 18.5kg and 25kg per square metre have a healthy weight , and people with a @entity17 over 30 are classed as obese			2
but the results were not universal across all religions			0
the most striking correlation was among @entity11 , she said , followed by @entity41 men			1
and appropriately enough , @entity72 - who aim to cleanse their minds of desire , which presumably includes pasties and pies - were found to have a healthier weight than non-believers			0
' the association between religion and obesity is unclear and unexplored in the general @entity84 population , ' dr @entity36 wrote			0
' some of this was explained demographically , but it was not accounted for by smoking status , alcohol consumption or physical activity level			0
' religious communities may need greater healthy weight promotion or benefit from tailored interventions built on their beliefs			1
' exercise : @entity11 were the most overweight , according to the study of more than 7,000 people the link between religion and health has been studied extensively in the @entity45 , where researchers believe the country 's obesity crisis could be tackled through religious means			1
one 2011 study of 5,500 people aged 45 to 84 found participants were more likely to be obese the more religiously active they were - from those who never worshipped to those who attended every week			0
obesity is on the rise in @entity0 , and not just among people of faith			0
the proportion of obese men has risen from 13.2 to 24.4 per cent in the last 20 years , according to government statistics - with the proportion of men up from 16.4 to 25.1 per cent			0
the huge rise has increased the strain on the @entity120 and on the patients themselves , as studies say obesity can shorten life by eight years and blight up to two decades with ill - health .			0

@entity38 *academic* @entity36 examined 7,400 people
believers ' @entity17 readings were almost one point higher than atheists '
@entity11 were the worst - *affected* , followed by @entity41 men , she said
she said religious communities may benefit from ' tailored interventions '
