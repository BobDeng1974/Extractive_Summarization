a new caviar is thought to be the most expensive food in the world with a kilo of the ' white gold ' fetching an incredible £ 200,000 - that 's a staggering £ 27,000 a teaspoon			1
the costly caviar is made from rare albino fish eggs and laced with 22 - carat gold			1
the brand - new product will be served to royalty and the super rich at some of the best restaurants in the world from @entity14 to @entity15			2
a kilo of the white gold @entity19 caviar will fetch a whopping £ 200,000 the powdery caviar , called @entity19 , was invented by fish farmer @entity22 , 51 , and his son @entity23 , 25			1
they say that the price is not just because of its exclusivity or its great taste , but also for its health advantages			1
the @entity32 father and son duo said they decided to also include gold leaf as it was good for the immune system			2
@entity23 , from the central @entity32 city of @entity37 , who along with his father is the first caviar producer in @entity32 , said : ' our @entity19 comes from the white roe of the extremely rare albino sturgeon			1
' the powdery caviar was invented by fish farmer @entity22 ( pictured ) and his son @entity23 the @entity44 were the first group of people to regularly consume the eggs of the sturgeon fish and they believed the @entity49 delicacy enhanced the physical strength and endurance of those who ate it			1
later , the @entity54 also attributed healing and medicinal properties to caviar			0
at present , and with the sturgeon in danger of extinction , white caviar has become a rare delicacy , exclusive and scarce , and now what is essentially the essence of white caviar is set to take it 's place as the world 's most exclusive food			0
the albino beluga sturgeon that produces it originally lived in the @entity49 but is now almost extinct in its native environment , where the last surviving wild albino beluga sturgeon live in the unpolluted areas near @entity74			0
although sturgeon fish usually live more than 100 years , very few of the albino variety reach that age , as the lack of melanin that makes them white is also a genetic disorder that limits their life			2
it also explains why their eggs have become the most sophisticated and expensive food in the world			0
he believes the extremely high standard of water in @entity32 flowing down from mountain snowfields helps to make sure the caviar produced in @entity32 is the best in the world as it has none of the pollution issues other countries have developed			0
he added : ' it is part of the reason why it probably taste so good , that and the fact that it is specially seasoned before being dehydrated , when it loses 80 per cent of its weight			2
' it is then grated extremely finely and mixed with 22 - carat gold , which in very small amounts has a very positive effect on the human immune system			0
' the golden yellow white spreadable powder that we create can quickly be made into a paste , risotto or put on toasted bread with butter			0
it only needs very small quantities for the flavour to be spread to a meal			0
' the taste is very strong and taste distinctly of fresh fish			1
' regular white caviar sold by the father and son duo has been known to fetch a price of up to £ 40,000			2
because the new @entity19 caviar uses five kilos of white caviar , which is then dehydrated to make one kilo of the gold mixture , it would cost at least £ 200,000 for the same amount			1
in order to give people a taste of what they have on offer , however , the producers are currently offering it at the discount price of £ 73,000 to selected customers			1
@entity23 said : ' it is certainly not a product for everyone , but there is definitely a market for extremely exclusive products especially when they are something new			0
' the @entity32 father and son only use older sturgeon , because the eggs are more elegant , smooth , aromatic and better tasting with a spongier texture .			0
