what colour is snow ? at first , it seems like an easy answer			1
anyone who has seen snow will know it is white , the reason being because it reflects almost all visible light incident upon it			1
but if you ’ve ever dug a deep hole in snow and looked down , you will have noticed that sometimes it can actually appear blue - and sometimes even red , in other circumstances - but why ? dreaming of a white @entity15 ? do n't dig too deep into snow , or you might start to notice a bluish tint			1
this is due to more and more of the ice crystals in the snow reflecting blue light , and absorbing other types , although of course in this image the effect is amplified by the shadows as well as mentioned , snow appears white because it reflects most visible light that strikes it			1
anything that does this means you see the whole spectrum of visible light , which looks white			2
snowflakes are understood to be unique - at a molecular level at least			0
but scientists have revealed that each and every one of them can in fact be sorted into 35 general shapes , which in turn tell experts how they formed			0
the shapes , which include column crystals , irregular snow particles and plane crystals - which make ‘ traditional ’ hexagonal snowflakes - vary according to temperature and humidity			1
@entity51 - based chemistry teacher @entity50 , created an infographic based on recent research to show the different shapes , which he published on his blog , @entity55			0
it shows 39 types of ‘ solid precipitation ’ or snow , including the 35 types of snowflakes and their names , which can be further divided into 121 subtypes			0
simpler snowflake shapes such as germ of ice crystals , are more common at low humidities , while more complex flakes , such as plane crystals are formed in areas of high humidity			1
other objects appear different colours because they absorb certain wavelengths of visible light but reflect others - a green apple , for instance , reflects only mostly the green wavelength			2
but , as reported by @entity81 , when snow is deep enough it can actually appear blue			2
the reason for this is due to ice crystals in the snow , according to the @entity87 and @entity88 ( @entity89 ) ‘ as light waves travel into the snow or ice , the ice grains scatter a large amount of light , ’ the @entity89 explains			1
while most of the light is reflected , there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue			2
when you see just the surface of a pack of snow , the scattering of the blue light is almost completely impossible to notice			1
but if you look into a significant amount of snow , about 3.3ft ( one metre ) or so , more photons emerge towards the blue end of the spectrum than the red end			2
‘ for instance , if you were to poke a hole in the snow and look down into the hole , you may see a bluish colour , ’ said the @entity89			2
while most of the light that is incident upon snow and ice is reflected , there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue , giving a slight bluish tint in deep snow and ice , such as this image from @entity129 in @entity130 ‘ as light waves travel into the snow or ice , the ice grains scatter a large amount of light , ’ the @entity87 and @entity88 ( @entity89 ) explains			1
shown is a slight bluish tint in a melting glacier in @entity139 when snow appears red , though , it is for an entirely different reason			1
this effect is due to cold - loving , fresh - water algae known as @entity145 that contain a bright red pigment			1
also known as ‘ watermelon snow ’ , it is ‘ most common during the summertime in high alpine areas as well as along coastal polar regions ’			0
interestingly , @entity153 nivalis cells actually appear green under a microscope			0
the reason they appear pink in snow to our eyes is due to a biochemical called beta - carotene			2
it protects the algae ’s chlorophyll from the sun ’s rays , but in the process gives them a red or pinkish hue , rather than green			0
be careful not to eat watermelon snow , though - it can act as a laxative			0
when snow appears red , though , it is for an entirely different reason			0
this effect is due to cold - loving , fresh - water algae known as @entity145 ( shown ) that contain a bright red pigment also known as ‘ watermelon snow ’ , red snow is most common during the summertime in high alpine areas as well as along coastal polar regions			1
shown is red snow in the @entity187 , @entity188 red snow can also be caused by iron - rich seawater , such as @entity190 in @entity130 ’s @entity191 , shown , where the water leaks from an ancient reservoir under the glacier			1
the iron oxidises when it comes into contact with the atmosphere , turning red last year , meanwhile , a @entity201 photographer spent two month living in a remote base in @entity130 to reveal how the area can be surprisingly colourful			0
@entity204 captured incredible images showing the bright pinks , greens and reds of the area - caused by everything from penguin poo to massive blooms of algae			2
mr @entity204 told @entity214 he was invited to the remote base by the @entity216 as its artist in residence			0
the @entity220 photographer now based in @entity201 spent two months at @entity221 , a permanent research station on @entity130 ’s @entity223			0
@entity204 spent two months at @entity221 , a permanent research station on @entity130 ’s @entity223 , to capture amazing images of coloured snow last year			0
here , the red snow effect is caused by the algae @entity145 the red colour doesnt always come from algae , however			1
adelie penguins transiting to and from the sea shore colour the surface of the snow with whatever substance they drag with their feet			0
the pink colour here is from penguin poo , since they eat mostly krill , a small type of shrimp			0

@entity246 might normally appear white - but it can also appear red and blue
in the @entity251 in @entity252 , snow can appear red due to a type of algae
@entity145 has a pigment that makes it appear red
but a blue colour can also be caused by light scattering in ice crystals
in deep snow , more and more light is scattered
this can give snow a bluish tint , rather the regular white that is seen
