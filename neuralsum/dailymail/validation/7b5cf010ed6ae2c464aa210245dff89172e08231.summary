@entity2 , now two years old , battled though surgery and chemotherapy to beat ovarian cancer happy and smiling in her mother ’s arms , @entity5 looks a picture of health			1
but the two - year - old is one of the youngest ovarian cancer sufferers and has battled through surgery and chemotherapy			1
she first showed symptoms at ten days old but it was not until she was four months old that doctors realised what was wrong			1
her mother @entity3 , of @entity18 , said : ‘ call it mother ’s instinct , but i felt very strongly for months that there was something wrong with @entity2			2
‘ i had spoken to medical professionals at least ten times because of her large belly and because she could n’t keep her milk down			0
i was dismissed as an overanxious first - time mother			0
’ mrs @entity29 and husband @entity31 , a nuclear energy development worker , grew more worried as doctors diagnosed their daughter with everything from constipation to colic			2
they finally found the true cause of her problems when they took her to @entity18 ’s @entity42 where doctors found her stomach swollen with more than a litre of fluid			1
an ultrasound scan revealed a 10cm mass on her right ovary , which was a rare cancerous juvenile granulosa cell tumour			0
mrs @entity29 , 26 , said : ‘ we felt awful			0
far from being a cute pot belly , the fluid had been building up because of the tumour			0
‘ the consultants seemed to know what they were looking for immediately			0
‘ we were stunned to be told our baby had ovarian cancer because you tend to consider it a disease that only affects older ladies			2
’ three days later on february 14 , 2013 , @entity2 underwent an operation , which lasted for three hours , to remove the tumour			2
a picture of health : while @entity2 looked like your average , bouncing baby , she had a rare cancerous juvenile granulosa cell tumour following surgery and chemotherapy , @entity2 's cancer was shown to be in remission by her first birthday following the surgery she needed three weeks of chemotherapy , which caused her to lose all of her blonde hair			1
but the treatment worked , and in august of that year scans showed that the cancer was in remission – all before @entity2 ’s first birthday			1
and , when her delighted parents married in september last year , she was well enough to be one of the bridesmaids .			0

@entity2 first *started* showing symptoms when she was ten days old
she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer after doctors found a 10cm tumour
after surgery and chemotherapy , she was in remission by her first birthday
