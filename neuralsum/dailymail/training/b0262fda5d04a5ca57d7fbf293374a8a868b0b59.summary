@entity1 legend @entity0 is hoping @entity3 fans do the right thing and applaud @entity5 if the @entity7 star breaks the @entity9 goalscoring record during saturday 's @entity10			1
@entity5 can go level with the @entity14 league 's top goalscorer of all - time , @entity15 , if he scores against @entity3 and would set a new record if manages a double at the @entity18			1
' why would @entity3 fans not tribute @entity21 ? ' @entity19 told @entity22 during the week			2
' they do applaud @entity1 players , remember @entity24 scored in the @entity10 and some clapped him			2
@entity5 is currently one goal behind @entity15 's @entity9 goalscoring record @entity5 controls the ball during training at @entity1 's training ground at the @entity30 @entity32 legend @entity0 made 26 appearance for @entity1 in the 1990s ' @entity5 is mythical , it would be arrogant not to applaud a myth			1
that would just show you can not see beyond the football team you play for			0
' likewise , i believe that @entity40 would applaud @entity41			2
' the @entity32 thinks whichever side handles the pressure of the contest between the @entity14 giants at the @entity18 will prevail			0
four - time @entity46 winner @entity5 will come up against @entity3 star @entity41 once more @entity5 takes on @entity41 during last season 's @entity10 clash ; the @entity7 would go on to net a hat - trick ' @entity1 are not as rampant as @entity3 at the moment , ' added @entity0			1
' @entity3 are scoring a lot			0
but they are under pressure and will go seven points behind if they lose to @entity1			0
' it will be a close game and whoever has less nerves will be the winner			0
