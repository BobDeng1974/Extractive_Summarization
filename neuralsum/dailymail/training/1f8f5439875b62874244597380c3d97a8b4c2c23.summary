by @entity0 a badly injured sea turtle 's prospects are looking up - thanks to a new prosthetic fin designed by an @entity5 team and modeled after the tail of a @entity8 fighter jet			1
the green sea turtle , named ' @entity10 , ' the @entity12 word for ' freedom , ' was caught in a fishing net off @entity5 's @entity16 coast in early 2009			1
with his two left flippers badly wounded , rescuers had to amputate , leaving him with a pair of stumps that made it difficult to swim			2
the prosthetic is modeled after the wings of a @entity8 fighter jet			1
inspired by the design of @entity36 's @entity35 warplane , researchers designed the new prosthetic with two fins			1
researchers originally designed a prosthetic based on a fish 's dorsal fin			1
the contraption provided some improvement , but @entity10 still had trouble breathing and rising to the surface			2
then , inspired by the design of @entity36 's @entity35 warplane , they designed a new prosthetic with two fins			1
the device , somewhat resembling the aircraft 's wings , was strapped onto @entity10 's back , allowing him to move easily around his tank			0
@entity54 , director of @entity5 's @entity27 , said @entity10 was initially fitted with a diver 's fin , but it provided little relief and he bumped into things as he tried to swim			1
@entity60 , an industrial design student at @entity63 's @entity62 , read about the animal on the @entity65 and wanted to help			0

the device , somewhat resembling the aircraft 's tail , was strapped onto @entity10 's back on thursday , allowing him to move easily around his tank			2
the ' stealth ' addon being put on @entity10 's back ' i discovered it worked better than one fin on the back , ' @entity60 explained			2
' with two fins , he keeps relatively balanced , even above the water			0
' @entity54 said that @entity10 will never be able to return to the wild			0
however , he shares a tank with a blind female turtle named @entity90 , and researchers are optimistic the pair will mate , potentially adding to the local population of the endangered green sea turtles			0

he said it is difficult to say exactly how old the two turtles are , but they are estimated to be between the ages of 20 and 25 , and approaching the age of sexual maturity			0
' we have great plans for this guy , ' @entity54 said			0
' they will never go back to the wild , but their offspring will be released the minute they hatch and go immediately into the sea and live normally in the wild , ' he added .			0

@entity121 named @entity10 had both his left fins amputated
new prosthetic fin was designed by an @entity5 team and modeled after the tail of a @entity8 fighter jet
@entity129 can now swim normally - and is expected to breed
