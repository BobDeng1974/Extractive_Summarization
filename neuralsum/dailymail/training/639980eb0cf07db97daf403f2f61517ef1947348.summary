a storefront in @entity2 's lower east side is advertising a bar just for pregnant women			1
whether or not it 's a hoax or viral marketing stunt , it 's got @entity8 residents birthing anger			1
the name of the so - called bar is @entity12 and it 's located on @entity13 and @entity14 where pregnant women can supposedly get their alcohol fix for two , reports the @entity16			1
' all you mothers - to - be should come check out our trimester specials and our 9 - month happy hour because now you ’re drinking for two ! , ' reads the storefront that has people fuming			2
too much ? : this advertisement for the first ever pregnant bar in @entity2 's @entity26 has some enraged marketing : the campaign is pregnant with baby jokes like one they posted on their @entity31 that reads , ' never thought we 'd see our baby come to life , especially with a billboard in @entity36 ! ‪ # ‎ gestationsny ‬ ' birthing humor or hatred ? : jokes like this had critics fuming , some of whom who took to @entity44 and @entity31 to bash the campaign for being offensive and insensitive the @entity44 page offers a titillating image of a woman , who appears to have a photo - shopped pregnant belly , popping a champagne bottle			1
the @entity44 page points out the fact that both pregnant women and men can drink more because they have bigger bellies			1
' the bigger the belly , the more you can drink			2
true for men and pregnant women			1
# gestationsny ' says a slogan for what might be a viral marketing stunt			1
' # gestationsny will have free pregnancy test kits when you buy a pitcher			1
check out our profile on # @entity69 to see what else we ’ll carry , ' the @entity44 page says			1
according to the website @entity73 , the racy new bar concept is likely a viral marketing campaign for the bar finding app @entity77			1
despite the attention grabbing technique being successful , it 's a bit of a miscarriage with critics who find the campaign distasteful and offensive			0
it seems some may not have realized that the campaign is a farce			0
for real ? : this is the location where the @entity12 bar will allegedly be opening soon critics : some angry readers did n't catch on to the fact that the campaign may be a hoax concerned for health : this woman voiced her concerns about the health dangers for the unborn child associated with drinking while pregnant ' this is really sick , a real disparate , how would you entice a pregnant woman to drink alcohol which will take effects on the unborn , this is really ridiculous			1
i would call on the @entity108 , to close this stupid peoples door business that are endangering the health of the unborn			0
. ! ! ! ! ! ! , ' writes @entity112 on @entity44			0
@entity44 user @entity113 also had a bone to pick with the campaign			0
' you are promoting actions that are dangerous to the health of an unborn child			0
unfortunately , many babies are born with @entity121 that produces learning and behavior disabilities as well as physical ones as well			0
everyone know , that excessive drinking is equal to using drugs while pregnant			0
why would you promote this kind of behavior , and i hope that this is a joke ? , ' she wrote			0
some however thought the campaign was funny and wrote things like , ' what a perfect place to find women already on the ­ perfect birth control ! ' the @entity16 reports that @entity138 3 leader @entity137 says that the bar has n't applied for a liquor license yet so chances are it is n't a real thing			2
' they ’re saying it ’s a bar , but they have n’t applied for a liquor license			2
at this point it ’s nothing			0
maybe it ’s going to be a milk bar or a juice bar , ' she said			0
' when possible patrons call the business a voice mail of a woman says , ' visit us on october 25 at 504 east fifth street before that water breaks			0
' the campaign is pregnant with baby jokes like one they posted on their @entity31 that reads , ' never thought we 'd see our baby come to life , especially with a billboard in @entity36 ! ‪ # ‎ gestationsny ‬ ' even though patrons of the bar are meant to be expecting , no one knows what to expect from @entity12 .			2
