by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:10 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 17:44 est , 5 august 2013 councils are using millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money to hire private detectives for snooping operations			1
dozens of town halls , several quangos and even one central government department used the investigators to check on both members of the public and their own staff			1
officials spent nearly £ 4million in two years on covert surveillance , background checks and other intrusive investigations by private eyes			1
@entity20 : 999 call centre worker @entity21 , from @entity22 was put under investigation by @entity24 who suspected her of moonlighting while on sick leave the startling scale of the use of private eyes by state bodies came as it emerged investigators employed by a fire brigade fitted a gps tracking device to the family car of a 999 call centre worker			1
@entity21 , 35 , was put under investigation by @entity24 who suspected her of moonlighting while on sick leave			2
the private eyes they employed telephoned her with fake offers of work in an effort to lure her into a confession – but were rumbled when she traced their telephone number on the internet			1
mrs @entity21 – who insists she has done nothing wrong and was not working illicitly – was also tipped off by neighbours who saw investigators acting suspiciously outside her @entity53 home			2
she has now left her job with an £ 11,000 payoff after agreeing not to sue the fire authority for ‘ unnecessary surveillance ’ and intrusion into her private life			1
critics said the case exposed the worrying extent of state snooping by unregulated private investigators ( @entity65 )			1
concerned : @entity66 , chairman of the @entity67 , who has conducted an inquiry into @entity65 , says their use is becoming widespread in recent weeks the so - called ‘ secret ’ hacking scandal has revealed how ‘ shady ’ private eyes employed by blue chip companies , law firms and celebrities hacked , blagged and stole private information			1
@entity78 are demanding the publication of a list of 102 firms and private individuals who engaged corrupt private eyes which is being kept secret by the @entity85 and @entity86			1
there is no suggestion any of those @entity65 engaged by councils and other public bodies have acted unlawfully			1
but they show how the private investigation industry has extended its reach deep into the public sector			1
@entity95 was warned about the use of private investigators by councils , law firms and others during his inquiry into the press , but did not investigate them or mention them in his final report			1
@entity66 , chairman of the @entity67 , who has conducted an inquiry into @entity65 , said : ‘ i am concerned that the use of @entity65 seems to be becoming more and more widespread			1
‘ this is a worrying trend			2
the government must put forward its announced regulation for private investigators as a matter of urgency			1
’ @entity114 , director of pressure group @entity115 , said : ‘ private investigators have been able to hide in the shadows for too long , even when they ’re being paid with taxpayers ’ money			1
‘ the fact that numerous public bodies think it is acceptable to use private investigators to snoop on their own staff should send a chill down the spine			1
‘ as the lengths that some private investigators will go in their work becomes abundantly clear , there ’s a risk of a ‘ ‘ see no evil , hear no evil ’ ’ culture emerging around snooping			1
‘ far more could be done to rein in who is allowed to launch surveillance operations and making them responsible for the investigators working on their behalf			2
’ freedom of information requests by @entity115 revealed some £ 3.9million of taxpayers ’ money was spent on private eyes over two years			1
that included 37 councils , several quangos and the @entity146			2
among the activities investigated by council - sponsored @entity65 were fly - tipping , blue badge fraud , fake insurance claims and housing fraud			1
they were also used to investigate parties in care proceedings			2
in addition , several councils used @entity65 to probe fraud allegations against staff accused of stealing from their employer or faking sick leave			1
the @entity146 said it had used @entity65 to probe driving test fraud and fake personal injury claims			1
the @entity166 litigation authority used @entity65 to examine insurance fraud , and the @entity168 for debt collection			1
the @entity170 used @entity65 to conduct ‘ fisheries surveillance ’			1
the @entity172 said they were used for an ‘ internal discipline investigation ’			2
laws due to come into force next year will see shady private investigators face jail if they fail to abide by new regulations			1
all investigators will be registered , forced to pass a national qualification , and undergo background checks before they are granted a licence			2
operating without a licence will be a criminal offence punishable with a six - month jail term and a £ 5,000 fine			2
overlooked : @entity95 was warned about the use of private investigators by councils , law firms and others during his inquiry into the press , but did not investigate them or mention them in his final report mr @entity114 said the use of the tracking device to snoop on mrs @entity21 was a ‘ staggeringly heavy - handed and intrusive response ’			1
the mother of two , who lives with construction manager husband @entity200 , 37 , and children @entity201 , five , and @entity203 , two , returned to work last october after taking maternity leave			0
while off she had started a part - time balloon decorating business			0
shortly afterwards , she was off sick with stress and began to receive suspicious calls from would - be customers asking her to take on work			0
she checked her @entity211 car and found a gps tracking device had been fitted underneath			0
she said : ‘ i have never felt as scared in my life , i could n’t go out , could n’t do my shopping			0
it stopped me doing anything			0
’ the emergency call handler was given a letter informing her she was under investigation			0
on october 31 she was signed off sick due to stress , depression and a recently diagnosed condition , hypothyroidism , which can cause symptoms such as tiredness , weight gain and aches			0
‘ as soon as i booked sick , i refrained from work			0
my husband took over the reins of the simple stuff but i did n’t work with the balloons			0
i took the website down and did n’t think of doing any more			0
’ within days she began receiving ‘ funny phone calls ’ trying to get her to take on work			0
but searching the internet for the number brought up the private investigator			2
she then found the tracker device which was attached by magnets and fitted with a sim card to allow her every movement to be monitored			0
‘ this is an infringement into my family life , ’ she said			0
‘ the whole situation has made me very ill. it is not right that public money is being used in this way			2
it was horrible to think someone was watching us			0
’ mrs @entity21 , who is now working full - time on her balloon business , added : ‘ i have n’t been a mum during all this			0
it has affected the whole family			0
i ’ve lost what was basically a £ 30,000 - a - year career			2
’ she said the private detective agency was @entity258 - based @entity260 , operating under the internet name ‘ localpi ’			2
the @entity263 fire service refused to comment			0
@entity264 : the tracking device was left on the back of mrs @entity21 's @entity211 while she was off sick			0
their use by @entity65 falls under a very grey area of the law putting a gps tracking device on someone ’s car to monitor their movements sounds like something out of a @entity278 film or an episode of @entity280			1
but covert surveillance techniques such as these are far from the exclusive preserve of spies and police detectives			0
councils and other public bodies can use them to follow both the public and their staff if they suspect them of wrongdoing			1
and their use by unregulated private eyes also falls into a very grey area of the law			2
if surveillance of the public is ordered by the state , it will be covered by the @entity300 ( @entity300 ) which gave councils the right to carry out snooping operations			2
this led to examples such as councils tracking parents to see if they were lying about which school catchment area they lived in			0
recent changes to the law mean town halls must get permission from a magistrate			0
but it appears many cases of state snooping , including that of 999 call operator @entity319 , fall outside this law			0
@entity300 applies only to the actions of councils and other bodies when they are performing their core public functions – such as a fire authority combating bogus 999 calls			1
but the surveillance on mrs @entity21 related to her status as an employee			0
as a result , the law which applies in the case is the @entity334			0
it allows snooping for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime			0
it also requires that monitoring is not undertaken for minor reasons – and requires intelligence or evidence before it can be conducted			0
in accepting a payout , mrs @entity21 has foregone any legal recourse			0
had she not she could have sued for breach of privacy , and the fire authority would have had to justify the level of surveillance and the methods it used .			0

public bodies spent nearly £ 4million on investigators over two years
comes as @entity78 demand publication of names of private firms using @entity65
their use was not investigated by the @entity362 , despite warnings
