the @entity4 was greeted with the most hostile reception he has faced during his time in office as members of the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) warned that they are under intense stress amid major changes to education and the threat of @entity23 inspections			1
mr @entity4 was heckled as he told the @entity17 's conference in @entity25 that they would ' part company ' over concerns about @entity23 , and was jeered by delegates when he suggested that no school would be marked down in national curriculum tests because one child was off sick			1
@entity33 president @entity32 told mr @entity4 children and their teachers had ' never had it so bad ' and described him as a ' fanatical personal trainer ' forcing schools to keep jumping through hoops without realising ' the damage he is causing to the body or the system '			0
as she introduced @entity4 to the conference for a question and answer session , she said : ' you can not fail to be aware that the morale of the profession is at an all time low			1
many are angry at what is happening to the education system			0
' some school leaders are taking early retirement , while others do not want to take on headships because of the pressure			0
' those of us in education , leaders and learners , have never had it so bad			0
it is within your power to put this right			0
' mr @entity4 clashed repeatedly with delegates during the hour - long debate			0
@entity72 , head of @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity71 said : ' the culture we 've got at the moment is one of bullying and fear , you ask why headteachers are going down with stress			0
' it is because they are spending monday , tuesday , wednesday waiting for @entity23 , not because they are not doing well , but because it ( the outcome ) depends on the people that come			0
' it 's because we 're working in a culture of fear , not one of working together			2
' mr @entity4 told the conference : ' if @entity23 causes you stress , then i 'm grateful for your candour , but we are going to have to part company			2
' one delegate responded with ' are you leaving them ? ' in a robust defence , mr @entity4 went on to say : ' what i have heard is repeated statements that the profession faces stress , and insufficient evidence about what can be done about it			0
' he added : ' what i have n't heard over the last hour is a determination to be constructive , critical yes , but not constructive			0
' conflict : mr @entity4 ( pictured speaking at today 's conference in @entity25 ) had a heated debate with headteachers delegates suggested he was the cause of headteachers ' stress and groaned when he responded : ' if people find it stressful that i 'm demanding higher standards , then i 'm not going to stop demanding higher standards			1
' during the morning 's session the union overwhelmingly passed a vote of no confidence in the government 's education policies			1
many of mr @entity4 's reforms are " not in the best interests of children " , it said			2
heads raised particular concerns about the new national curriculum , major test and exam reform and schools being forced into becoming academies			1
@entity143 , proposing the motion , said : ' enough is enough			0
this motion 's intention is to send the strongest message possible to this government that many of their education policies are failing our children , their parents and the very fabric of our school communities			1
' the @entity17 is the first union of headteachers to pass a vote of no confidence in the government 's education reforms			1
the @entity165 's three biggest teachers ' unions , the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) , the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) and the @entity166 passed similar votes at their @entity169 conferences			1
the @entity33 and the @entity166 are planning regional strikes in the @entity171 next month in a continuing row over pay , pensions and workload with the prospect of a national walkout looming in the autumn			0
the latest vote of no confidence is a further sign of the worsening relations between the government and the teaching profession			0
mr @entity143 , a consultant headteacher from @entity185 said that many of the government 's education policies were ' ill - thought - through , not based on empirical evidence and devoid of meaningful consultation and lacking in understanding			1
' conference : @entity4 spoke at the @entity17 event after being given a vote of no confidence by attendees he also suggested that ministers are attempting to push reforms through in a way that is ' disruptive , damaging and pernicious '			1
' with this government it is ideology gone mad , ' mr @entity143 told the conference			2
@entity203 , senior vice principal of @entity204 in @entity205 suggested that the government is trying to reform too much of the education system at once			2
' if the @entity207 had a business plan he would know that to be successful you do n't change everything at the same time			0
' ministers are currently attempting to overhaul the curriculum , assessment , accountability and funding , he said			2
the resolution called on the @entity17 's executive to ensure that the government is left in no doubt that that the union represents the ' serious concerns ' of the profession			1
it was passed with 99.3 per cent of the vote			0
delegates also passed a second resolution raising concerns that ' too much power is currently given to one person to determine national policy on the basis of personal preference and ideologically - driven assumption			0
' @entity235 a deputy headteacher and member of the @entity17 's executive said that he had two children and was concerned about their education			1
' this is so important because i want to stop people playing political ping pong with my children 's education			2
' the @entity17 represents around 85 per cent of primary headteachers and 40 per cent of secondary leaders in @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249			1
heckled : the @entity4 did not get a warm welcome from the conference audience a @entity253 spokesman said : ' we need to raise standards so we have an education system that is on a par with the world 's best			1
' our academies programme is turning around hundreds of underperforming schools , we are introducing a world class curriculum and our reforms to exams will create qualifications that will keep pace with the demands of universities and employers			1
surely this is something the @entity17 should be supporting			1
' we will not stand by when schools are failing our children			0
sponsored academies are turning around hundreds of underperforming schools and ensuring pupils are given every chance to fulfil their potential			2
' we are also overhauling special educational needs provision to put young people and their families at its centre , with more say in where they study and more control over the support they receive			0
