lengthy applause is seen as the ultimate mark of approval on a performance			2
but rather than showing we like what we see , researchers believe the length of time we clap is closely linked to peer pressure			0

applause : once one person starts clapping it spreads like an ' infection ' spreading from one person to another - with the crowd ' instinctively ' responding to the noise , researchers say ( file picture ) crowds continue to clap following a performance until someone is brave , tired or bored enough to stop and the volume of applause starts dropping , according to researchers			1
lead researcher dr @entity29 , from @entity30 in @entity31 , said : ‘ once someone has started clapping , it only takes a couple of seconds for the rest of the crowd to follow			1
most people are n’t making a conscious decision about whether they should applaud			0
‘ as individuals , we do n’t want to be the only ones clapping , nor do we want to clap alone			2
it is a very instinctive form of peer pressure , it is incredibly powerful			0
’ but once the first one or two people stop clapping , the rest of the audience shortly follows			1
however , until this occurs , the group will keep on applauding			2
‘ you can get very different lengths of applause from identical talks , with rounds of applause that were two to three times longer , ’ said dr @entity29			1
‘ we found boredom or tiredness is the main trigger for an individual to stop clapping , and once this happens , the rest of the crowd soon follow			1
’ he said the findings suggest the length of applause is not a safe way to gauge the quality of a performance			0
findings : crowds continue to clap following a performance until someone is brave , tired or bored enough to stop , according to the lead researcher from @entity30 ( pictured ) in @entity31 ‘ you should be wary of encores - often people just keep on clapping as long as everyone else is , ’ said dr @entity29			1
‘ on the plus side , performers can take comfort from this if they get a short round of applause			0
’ the research , which is published in the @entity86 , involved 107 students			0
they were split into six different groups and asked to listen to two presentations each			0
although the length of applause varied from group to group , the average time it took for the whole group to start clapping after the first individual had begun was under three seconds			2
' we found boredom or tiredness is the main trigger for an individual to stop clapping , and once this happens , the rest of the crowd soon follow ' dr @entity29 of @entity30 it also took the crowd less than three seconds to cease clapping after the first person stopped			1
dr @entity29 said that once 5 to 15 per cent of the group ended their applause , the rest were likely to follow			1
the study concluded : ‘ variation in the length of applause can arise even for talks which are equally appreciated by the audience			0
‘ @entity116 in the audience interactions can sometimes result in unusually strong or weak levels of appreciation , independent of the quality of the presentation			0
‘ groups must coordinate the cessation of clapping and on different occasions this can take longer or shorter periods of time to achieve			2
' the social problem an audience must solve after an academic presentation is not how and when to start a round of applause , but it is rather how to coordinate its end			0

crowd ' instinctively ' responds to the noise of one person applauding
clapping continues until someone is brave , tired or bored enough to stop
