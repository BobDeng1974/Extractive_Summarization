by @entity0 @entity1 : @entity2 has become the first @entity3 to have a single - port hysterectomy it is fortunate that @entity2 has an excellent relationship with her surgeon			1
for just eight weeks before her scheduled hysterectomy , he revealed that she would be the first person in the @entity10 to undergo a new technique : he was going to remove her womb through her belly button			1
this incredible procedure sees the hysterectomy performed through a single incision in the belly button			1
it is virtually scar-less and patients recover within a fortnight			2
it ’s all a far cry from the traditional operation that leaves a long scar across the abdomen and involves days spent in hospital and weeks of pain and recovery			2
it is being pioneered in the @entity10 by consultant gynaecologist professor @entity29 , one of the godfathers of laparoscopic , or keyhole , surgery			1
‘ the procedure is a huge advancement as it frees women from discomfort quickly and safely , with little risk of infection , ’ he says			2
‘ it ’s suitable for everyone and i hope it will one day become the most common form of hysterectomy			1
’ a hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus , or womb			1
about 65,000 are performed each year in the @entity10 , and one in five women will undergo the surgery at some point in their lives , usually by the age of 60			1
it is undertaken most commonly due to painful fibroids , endometriosis , severe bleeding , vaginal prolapse or uterine and cervical cancer			2
women may also choose the surgery if they have the @entity62 or @entity64 gene , which significantly raises their chance of ovarian cancer			1
@entity2 needed the operation because of severe endometriosis , where small pieces of endometrial ( womb ) tissue attach to surrounding organs			1
it can cause extreme pain and heavy bleeding and affects about two million women			2
‘ my periods were always heavy and painful , ’ says @entity2 , 31 , who lives in @entity77 with her husband , @entity79 , 38 , a signalling engineer , and their children @entity83 , four , and @entity84 , one			1
‘ but as time went on they got worse and worse			2
’ on one occasion she passed out from the pain and blood loss , so her doctor referred her to professor @entity29			0
‘ i always knew i would need a hysterectomy at some point as my condition kept deteriorating , ’ she says			1
‘ since i was first referred 11 years ago , i ’ve had tissue lasered away six times but it is n’t a long - term solution			0
i ’d imagined intrusive abdominal surgery , so was thrilled to hear about the new operation			1
’ of the 57,000 hysterectomies performed annually in @entity104 hospitals , more than 35,000 are abdominal hysterectomies – where an incision of about 5in is made across the abdomen			1
the hospital stay is around five nights , and a further six to eight weeks are needed for recovery			0
two other main options exist : laparoscopic - assisted vaginal hysterectomy , where the womb is removed through the vagina ( not suitable for women who have had a caesarean ) , and total laparoscopic hysterectomy – keyhole surgery , where three to four incisions are made in the abdomen			1
this method accounts for less than six per cent of @entity10 hysterectomies			1
very occasionally this is done through an incision in the belly button , with the womb removed through the vagina			1
the new operation takes laparoscopic surgery one step further and has been made possible due to new instruments			2
prof @entity29 , who operates at @entity131 in @entity77 , says : ‘ i heard about the new procedure a year ago and have been waiting for the instruments to be refined			0
to my knowledge , this operation has been performed in only one other country – @entity136 – by an ex-pupil of mine			2
i am thrilled to introduce it here			0
’ @entity2 had her surgery two weeks ago , under general anaesthetic as a private patient at @entity143			1
first an incision was made – about half an inch long – into which a ‘ port ’ was inserted			2
this is like a small plate with three tiny holes through which different instruments are inserted into the abdomen			0
the first hole holds a tiny camera , another contains an instrument like minute tweezers that can grasp the womb , and the third takes an instrument that can seal blood vessels and cut tissue using high - frequency thermal energy			0
all the instruments can be used remotely			0
prof @entity29 explains : ‘ the abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to allow better visualisation			0
then one fallopian tube is grasped and the blood vessels are sealed , followed by the second			0
‘ a loop - shaped instrument – like a lasso – is inserted and tightened about the uterus to secure it , then thermal energy cuts it away			0
’ the uterus is cut up in situ and sucked out through the port			0
the whole procedure took just 45 minutes			0
prof @entity29 left an ovary and fallopian tube , so @entity2 wo n’t go through early menopause			1
‘ i was able to walk after less than 24 hours , ’ she says			0
‘ when i went home – after just two nights – i only took paracetamol and ibuprofen as there was n’t much pain			0
‘ after ten days i was able to pick my daughter up and drive around			0
now i feel a little discomfort but nothing compared to the agony of my periods			0
‘ i am so relieved i ’ll never suffer that again , and that my scar will be near - invisible so i ’ll still be able to wear a bikini ! ’ bmihealthcare.co.uk / chelsfieldhospital			0
