professor @entity13 , the government ’s obesity tsar , yesterday called on the chains to offer clear nutrition information , smaller packs and healthy alternatives			2
last week the @entity20 suggested maximum sugar intake should be limited to as few as six teaspoons a day			1
this means a cinemagoer who buys a large popcorn and fizzy drink could be consuming their entire week ’s sugar allowance in just one sitting			1
a 200g box of toffee popcorn at @entity31 comes in at 840 calories and 121g of sugar , equivalent to about 30 teaspoons			1
adding a 32oz @entity34 carries an extra 407 calories and 101.2g of sugar , or 25 teaspoons			1
a large bucket of sweet popcorn at @entity39 amounts to 1,005 calories , which is more than half of a woman ’s recommended daily intake			1
and at @entity46 , a 200g tub of toffee popcorn contains 138.9g of sugar , which is equivalent to about 35 teaspoons			1

‘ the least they should do is provide clear information on calories			0

it also urged cinemas to stop advertising supersize portions as ‘ better value ’ deals			0
@entity65 spokesman @entity89 said : ‘ cinemas are inherently family focused spaces , yet we all recognise them to be one of the worst spaces for promoting portions of high fat , salt and sugar snacks with little or no choice of healthier alternatives			2
’ cinemas do display nutrition but @entity65 blast them as one of the worst spaces for promoting portions of high fat , salt and sugar snacks with few options for healthy alternatives the cinemas do display nutrition information on their websites , with @entity46 also putting calories on menu boards at the tills			2
a @entity31 spokesman said it had trialled healthy choices such as fruit and nuts in the past but these had proved unpopular with customers , adding : ‘ the cinema experience is seen as a treat by most people			0
’ despite this , the chain is testing a smaller 16oz cup for fizzy drinks , which may soon be rolled out across its cinemas			0
both @entity31 and @entity46 said visitors were welcome to bring their own snacks			0
