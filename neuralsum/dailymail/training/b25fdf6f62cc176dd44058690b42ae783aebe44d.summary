by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale former @entity2 chief executive @entity1 is to play a bigger part than expected in the hunt for a manager to replace the axed @entity6			1
@entity7 , whose decision to step down as @entity2 ceo around the time that sir @entity11 retired did the club no favours , has purposely given his successor @entity14 space and played no role in the last two transfer windows , despite remaining on the football club board			1
but @entity7 , who still represents @entity2 at @entity20 meetings with @entity14 , will be one of those closely consulted in the selection process			1
@entity2 have mentioned carrying out due diligence on all candidates for the post			2
but that will be done internally rather than by bringing in headhunters			0
there may be rioting in @entity45 and warnings from @entity48 midfielder @entity47 of team buses being pelted with stones but @entity51 are confident enough about @entity53 arrangements for the @entity54 to include only four security personnel in their party			2
the prestigious @entity58 award decided by football writers looks like going to prolific @entity61 scorer @entity60 or his talismanic captain @entity62			1
but unfortunately neither might be in the country to collect the trophy at the gala dinner on may 15 , when @entity60 is likely to be back in his native @entity67 and @entity62 will be on a much - needed holiday before the @entity54			1
the only previous occasions when the footballer of the year , the most important individual award in the game , has n’t been feted in person were when @entity75 ’s @entity74 was having knee surgery and @entity61 ’s @entity77 was at a racecourse			0
prize winner ? @entity60 could miss the footballer of the year awards if he wins not on our telly , @entity6 axed @entity2 manager @entity6 was loosely sounded out by both @entity83 and @entity84 about being a @entity54 pundit earlier in the season			1
but @entity6 was concerned at the reaction of fans , with @entity2 having such a torrid time , about being seen working on tv when the transfer window had opened			2
turn off : @entity6 is unlikely to be as desirable as a @entity54 tv pundit now he has been sacked talking a good game : @entity94 will be one of the pundits for the @entity83 however , now @entity6 no longer has the cachet of being @entity99 boss , the tv offers might not be so forthcoming			1
@entity83 , who have @entity6 ’s arch critic @entity94 in their line - up as well as his former assistant coach @entity103 , have no plans to add the @entity106 boss to their team and @entity84 say it is unlikely they will			2
@entity110 chairman @entity109 seems unperturbed about upsetting the @entity20 by unveiling his @entity112 findings during the last week of their season			1
the proposals will be outlined to an @entity110 board meeting on may 7 , four days before the final fixtures			0
not afraid : @entity110 chairman @entity109 will release the findings of his meanwhile , @entity119 have started to contact clubs who have breached their financial fair play regulations , so @entity123 can expect a call any time soon			2
the latest @entity110 financial figures do n’t augur well for their huge task of persuading their 17,000 corporate seat - holders , who bankroll the @entity131 business plan , to renew long - term deals , most of which expire in 2017			0
there has been a £ 2million fall in @entity131 revenue from a decline in available box sales			0
@entity131 chief executive @entity139 blames the recession and is confident that sales will pick up			0
they have done so on the boxing front , with all seats and boxes sold for the @entity147 v @entity149 rematch on may 31 , which will be watched by an 80,000 capacity crowd			0
@entity151 are understood to have agreed with a surprisingly conciliatory @entity152 that neither of the networks should put out a press release announcing the pick selection for the @entity157			0
that non-disclosure pact suited @entity151 a lot more as it prevented @entity152 from trumpeting that they have picks 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 7 of @entity163 clubs in the group stages , leaving @entity151 with 4 and 6 .			0

@entity7 to help @entity2 chief @entity14 *appoint* next manager
@entity60 and @entity62 could miss @entity170 ' dinner
@entity6 faces @entity54 pundit snub after sacking
@entity109 not worried about upsetting @entity20 clubs with *commission* findings
