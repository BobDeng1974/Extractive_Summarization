a chameleon balances carefully on a branch , waiting calmly for its prey ... except that if you look closely , you will see that this picture is not all that it seems			2
for the ' creature ' poised to pounce is not a colourful species of lizard but something altogether more human			0
featuring two carefully painted female models , it is a clever piece of sculpture designed to create an amazing illusion			1
it is the work of @entity17 artist @entity16			1
@entity16 daubed water - based body paint on the naked models to create the multicoloured effect , then intertwined them to form the shape of a chameleon			1
to complete the deception , the models rested on a bench painted to match their skin and held the green branch in the air beneath them			1
@entity16 can take weeks to plan one of his pieces and hours to paint it			1
speaking about @entity46 , he said : ' i worked about four days to design the motif bigger and paint it with colours			2
' the body painting took me about six hours with the help of an assistant			0
' i covered the hair with natural clay to make the heads look bald			0
camouflage job : a few finishing touches are applied to the two naked models to complete the transformation ' there are different difficulties on different levels as in every work , but i think that my passion and love to my work is so big , that i figure out a way to deal with difficulties			1
' my main inspirations are nature , my personal life - philosophy , every - day - life and people themselves			0
however , the finished result existed only briefly before the models were able to get up and wash the paint off – with just a video and some photographs to record it			2
the artist added : ' i think that body painting is a good way to learn to let something go , to separate from something			0
that happens again and again in life and it is good to be able to handle with it			0
' also the fast end of the artwork makes us perceive it in a much more intensive way			0
' but there is one way in which the chameleon can still claim to be the unchallenged master of disguise			0
unlike the real thing , @entity16 's models ca n't change their colour – unless he gets his paintbrush out .			1
