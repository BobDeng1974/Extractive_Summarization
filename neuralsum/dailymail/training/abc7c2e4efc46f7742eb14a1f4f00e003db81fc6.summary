by @entity0 from flower - filled meadows to scenic lakes and quaint villages , the photos captured the sights of a newlywed couple as they travelled across the east coast of @entity8 on the eve of @entity10			1
now , the astonishing set of images documenting @entity13 and @entity15 's honeymoon in august 1939 has been recreated in the present day			1
and although the pictures were taken 75 years apart , a remarkable number of things still appear the same			0
then : this remarkable colour photo shows @entity20 and @entity15 's visit to @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , during their honeymoon in august 1939 now : in a photo taken in present day , @entity22 features the same towering cathedral , scenic views and raised platform , but with a higher number of swans surprisingly similar : one honeymoon photo , captured by mr @entity35 's cousin @entity34 , shows a man in a cap riding his bicycle down @entity39 ( left )			1
incredibly , its present day version ( right ) also features a cathedral , an array of shops and a cyclist - albeit , with more road markings , better safety gear and vans instead of horses remarkable : @entity50 @entity39 , in @entity24 , cuts a startling similar scene in both sets of images , with buildings , vehicles and @entity56 overlooking the murky brown river below			2
however , time has seen the red postbox ( left ) replaced by a parking meter ( right ) , while the steps to the river have been demolished entirely popular : meanwhile , the @entity63 in @entity64 was seemingly a popular sight for passersby in august 1939 - just one month before the start of the @entity10 captial : the @entity69 capital looks similar in present day , with @entity70 and the houses of @entity72 in the background			1
but its new additions include the @entity76 couple : the old photos captured the sights of the newlywed couple as they travelled across the east coast of @entity8 on the eve of @entity10			1
@entity83 , the wedding of @entity35 , born 1916 , and @entity15 , born 1913 , at the @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity64 , on april 15 , 1939 one honeymoon photo , captured by mr @entity35 's cousin @entity34 , shows a man in a cap riding his bicycle down @entity39 in @entity24			1
incredibly , its present day version features the same towering cathedral , row of shops and a cyclist - albeit , with more road markings , better safety gear and vans and cars instead of horses			2
meanwhile , @entity50 @entity39 , also in @entity24 , is startlingly similar in both sets of images , with buildings , vehicles and @entity56 overlooking the murky brown river below			0
however , time has seen the red postbox replaced by a parking meter , while boating enthusiasts can no longer venture into the river via a set of stairs			0
well - preserved : one of the best - preserved images in the collection , this photo shows a village sign in @entity121 , @entity122 , which is situated not far from @entity123 faded : the photos were only recently uncovered by the couple 's grandson , @entity125 , who is himself a professional photographer , after spending years hidden away in mrs @entity15 's attic			2
mr @entity125 believes the sign ( above ) may have been taken down during the war to avoid assisting enemy forces in the event of an invasion a sun - lit walk : the honeymoon photos were taken as the @entity137 motored through the country in their @entity139			0
left , @entity140 in @entity141 in 1939 and , right , today a popular ride : the @entity139 was extremely popular at the time and its success propelled its manufacturer to become the biggest car company in @entity69 in the 1940s idyllic : in a present day photo , @entity149 in @entity122 is deserted , picturesque and bathed in a yellow sunset			2
mr and mrs @entity15 visited this spot during their honeymoon ready to sail : just weeks after the couples ' 900 - mile round trip , the peace and tranquility of the country was to be shattered by the outbreak of the @entity10			1
above , a boat is moored on banks of @entity63 in @entity64 in 1939 expensive : a modern white - coloured boat , featuring a @entity69 flag , is pictured on the river , 75 years after the original honeymoon photos were taken by mr @entity125 and the @entity63 in @entity64 seemingly still proves a popular sight for passersby - but with expensive modern ships replacing old sailing boats			2
other recreated images include the @entity174 in @entity122 , @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity140 in @entity141 and a quiet residential street in @entity178 , @entity179			2
the original honeymoon photos , which were taken as the @entity137 motored through the country in their @entity139 , show them camping in sun - lit meadows , driving down country roads and relaxing by stunning lakes			0
spectacular : speaking of the photos , mr @entity125 told @entity186 : ' i do n't remember hearing my grandmother talk about the holiday			0
' @entity83 , @entity125 and mrs @entity15 's car is parked outside a church at upper @entity192 , @entity122 , in august 1939 barely a difference : he added : ' but my mother had told me about the pictures due to my interest in photography			1

@entity267 is known about my great uncle @entity34 , as he died , also from tuberculosis , one year after the photos were taken			0
