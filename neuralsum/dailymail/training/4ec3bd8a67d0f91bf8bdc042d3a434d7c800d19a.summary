if @entity20 would not allow @entity34 to impregnate her naturally , they had to find the means of impregnating her unnaturally ... under fire : the latest allegations about the @entity12 and her mother follow @entity0 's claim that the @entity12 was born to a @entity14 surrogate mother who worked as a royal cook ‘ there was only one course of action			1
artificial insemination had the merit of accommodating both @entity34 and @entity20 ’s needs , insofar as the conception of a legitimate heir to the throne was concerned			0

this book is best read as a work of fiction and it should n’t be taken seriously			1
’ @entity27 claims the sources for her information are ‘ legion ’			0
