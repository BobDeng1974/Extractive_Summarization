by @entity1 reporter published : 12:42 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 05:37 est , 11 december 2012 middle class people will dominate the world in 20 years , a major @entity3 government report said yesterday			1
it said the number of people who can count themselves as middle income will treble to three billion and the number of people living in poverty will halve			0
but the report warned that the increased consumption of millions of newly enriched middle class people may strain resources , including food and water , unless innovation and peace allow rising demand to be met			1
overpowering : by 2030 , @entity26 and @entity27 will replace the @entity3 and @entity28 in terms of power , a study claims growing : the harbour city of @entity32 has a population of over 18 million people ; the report says that people will be competing for resources in 2030 inevitability : the study predicts that @entity26 and @entity27 will hold the most power in coming years , while the @entity3 and @entity28 have been on a steady decline other perspective : any way the power index falls , developing states will overtake developed states consumption : by 2030 , @entity27 and @entity26 's middle class will rise to become major consumers , taking more resources the report , published by the @entity52 , suggested that the economies of @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity54 will generate the new middle class , who will produce better education standards , better health , and the advance of women into greater wealth and power			1
it added : ‘ individual empowerment will accelerate substantially owing to poverty reduction and a huge growth of the global middle class			0
‘ for the first time , a majority of the world ’s population will not be impoverished , and the middle classes will be the most important social and economic sector in the vast majority of countries around the world			0
demand for consumer goods , including cars , ( will ) rise sharply with the growth of the middle class			0
’ the new middle class will be mostly urban , with nearly two - thirds of the world 's population will live in cities by 2030 , with the majority of people connected by technology , protected by advanced health care and linked by countries that work together , perhaps with the @entity3 and @entity26 cooperating to lead the way			1
that 's the best case scenario in a report , @entity91 , released monday by the @entity3 government 's @entity52			2
in the worst case scenarios , rising population leads to conflict over water and food , especially in the @entity99 and @entity100 , and the instability contributes to global economic collapse			1
the study is the intelligence community 's analysis of where current trends will take the world in the next 15 to 20 years , intended to help policymakers plan for the best and worst possible futures to come			0
the report is broken down into what the @entity52 calls megatrends that are likely to occur and game - changers — the what - if 's that are less certain but would be so significant that they ca n't be ignored			0
among the major trends : the rise of a global middle class that is better educated , connected via technology and healthier due to advances in medicine			0
power will no longer reside with one or two key nations , but be spread across networks and coalitions of countries working together			0
in countries where there are declining birth rates and an aging population like the @entity3 , economic growth may slow			2
sixty percent of the world 's population will live in cities			1
globalization : a new global trends report says that two - thirds of the world 's population will be living in cities by 2030 ; here , @entity26 's most bustling seaside city , @entity32 , is seen planning ahead : the study is intended to help policymakers plan for the best and worst possible futures to come ; @entity145 , pictured yet even with these advances , food , water and energy will be more scarce			1
' nearly half of the world 's population will live in areas experiencing severe water stress , ' the report said			1
@entity100 and the @entity99 will be most at risk of food and water shortages , but @entity26 and @entity27 also vulnerable			1
among the anticipated crises is the worry of global economic collapse , fighting among nations that do n't adapt rapidly enough to change and the possible spillover of instability in the @entity99 and @entity164 to the rest of the world			2
technology is seen as a potential savior to head off some of this conflict , boosting economic productivity to keep pockets filled despite rising population , rapid growth of cities and climate @entity176 report outlines several ' @entity178 ' for 2030			2
under the heading ' stalled engines ' , otherwise known as the ' most plausible worst - case scenario , the risks of interstate conflict increase , ' the report said			0
' the @entity3 draws inward and globalization stalls			0
' in the most plausible best - case outcome , called ' @entity187 , ' the report said , ' @entity26 and the @entity3 collaborate on a range of issues , leading to broader global cooperation			1
' and under another heading , the report describes a world where ' inequalities explode as some countries become big winners and others fail			0
... without completely disengaging , the @entity3 is no longer the ' global policeman			0
'' trending : @entity27 is part of a global trend that is advancing towards an increasing urbanization , according to which more than half of the world 's population is living in towns and cities consumers : an @entity27 customer looks at a product on sale at a retail shop in @entity212 , @entity27 ; the middle class in the country will grow exponentially by 2030 and will consume much of the world 's goods the report warns of the mostly catastrophic effect of possible ' @entity219 , ' extraordinary events that can change the course of history			1
these include a severe pandemic that could kill millions in a matter of months and more rapid climate change that could make it hard to feed the world 's population			1
two positive events are also listed , including ' a democratic @entity26 or a reformed @entity231 , ' which could bring more global stability			2
one bright spot for the @entity3 is energy independence			0
' with shale gas , the @entity3 will have sufficient natural gas to meet domestic needs and generate potential global exports for decades to come , ' the report said .			2

@entity241 predicts that two - thirds of the world 's population will live in cities by 2030
also said that @entity26 and @entity27 will overpower long - reigning @entity3 and @entity28
but also predicts *competition* for resources , including food , space , and water , will be *fierce*
global *warming* and climate change also major factors of future decades
