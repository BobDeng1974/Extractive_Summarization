by @entity0 photographers are known to risk life and limb to snap terrible events in war zones			0
but two professionals from @entity6 have braved the destructive power of nature by capturing the moment when lava flows into the sea – from the water			1
@entity13 and @entity14 claim to be the first to bring this unique view of lava flow from the @entity17 in @entity6 to the world			1
the power of nature : the photographers swam in 110 degree water just 20 feet away from the eruption ( pictured ) so they could get closer for short bursts - but would have to swim back right away to get into cooler water and recover they had to enter the water within feet of where the lava was running into the surf , braving the scalding water and dodging ‘ lava bombs ’ floating towards them			1
‘ we swam in 110 ° c water just 20 feet away we could get closer for short bursts but would have to swim back right away to get into cooler water , ' mr @entity13 told @entity36			2
‘ the sand is not really sand it is more like glass and the water is filled with volcanic glass and lava bombs , ’ which he explained are chunks of lava that are hot and float around on the water ’s surface until they cool and sink			1
‘ we both came out of the water pretty cut up but it was worth it to capture a view that has not been done before , ’ he said			2
brave : the intrepid duo had to enter the water within feet of where the lava was running into the surf , braving the scalding water and dodging ‘ lava bombs ’ floating towards them			1
on the left , liquid lava streams into the steaming sea and on the right the light from the glowing rock is reflected on the surface of a wave close shave : the photographers have suffered burns for getting so close to their fiery subjects ( pictured )			0
@entity13 said : ' each volcano photo i capture is truly a unique moment in time never to be captured the same again ' the pair are able to capture dangerous sites and situations together which they say are too risky to enter into alone			2
they had to wait five years for the right conditions to photograph the eruption			2
of course their endeavour to snap the perfect picture is incredibly risky and in 2011 mr @entity13 shattered his ankle by falling into a ‘ lava tube ’			1
mr @entity14 had to rescue his friend using a camera bag and tripod as they had no rope and construct a make - shift splint from a tripod leg and belt to help him walk the mile - and - a - half back to the car			2
mr @entity13 write on his @entity95 page : ‘ i have been asked many times why i take such extreme risks for my photography			0
here is the reason why			0
i do n't want to make fake photos on the computer but i have to compete with people who do			0
’ hot property : @entity13 and @entity14 claim to be the first photographers to bring a unique view of lava flow from the @entity17 in @entity6 to the world - from the surf near the erruption ( pictured ) risky but worth it : mr @entity13 said : ‘ i have been asked many times why i take such extreme risks for my photography			1
here is the reason why			0
i do n't want to make fake photos on the computer but i have to compete with people who do			0
’ the violence of an eruption and a snaking flow of lava is pictured on the left , while a rainbow frames a trickle of lava running down rock into the sea on the right ‘ so to make my images stand out in a world of photoshopped falsehoods i need to take extreme risks to capture things that have n't been done before			1
‘ i do it so i can support my family off of my art. i love being a father and i want the best for my kids			0
i am willing to go to the ends of the earth to give it to them			0
but what father is n't			0
’ mr @entity13 and mr @entity14 use @entity145 surf housings to keep the water out of their specialist @entity150 cameras			1
mr @entity13 was brought up on the @entity151 in @entity6 and told @entity152 : ‘ there is no other place in the world that you can photography within feet of where you stood the day before and capture such dramatically different images			1
‘ each volcano photo i capture is truly a unique moment in time never to be captured the same again			0
’ the photographers both live in @entity162 and run the @entity163 together			0
dodging bombs : while the water might look clear in this picture , the photographers said the sand felt like glass and there were red hot ' lava bombs ' floating in the sea that could have hurt them timing is everything : the duo are able to capture dangerous sites together which they say are too dangerous to do so alone			1
they had to wait five years for the right conditions to photograph the eruption			2
they braved the hot water to take the image on the left and got incredibly close to a lava flow to show it next to the misty sea ( right )			1

@entity13 and @entity14 are the first to capture the lava flow from the @entity17 in @entity6 from the sea
they had to enter the water within feet of where the lava was running into the surf , braving the scalding water and dodging ‘ lava bombs ’ floating towards them - and have got injured for their art in the past
they said that the sand felt like glass , the water scalding and they often had to retreat to *colder* water
@entity209 had to wait five years for the right conditions to photograph the eruption - and do n't use @entity212
