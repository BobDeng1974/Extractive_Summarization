suicide : an autopsy report has confirmed that director @entity2 killed himself in august at least five female motorists reported seeing director @entity2 leap to his death from a @entity6 bridge in mid-august , according to 911 tapes released on tuesday			1
the 68 - year - old filmmaker behind movies like @entity10 and @entity11 committed suicide by jumping off @entity13 linking the @entity14 and @entity15 in broad daylight on august 19 in full view of boaters and passing drivers			1
‘ we are just on the @entity13 and there ’s a guy that looks like he ’s just about to jump off … he ’s jumped , he ’s jumped , [ off ] the @entity13 in @entity27 ! ’ said one 911 caller heard in a recording posted on @entity22			1
another witness reported the fatal leap to 911 operators , and was then transferred to a fire dispatcher			0
during the transfer , she could be heard gasping : ‘ @entity33			0
’ the caller said : ‘ he was a bald white guy			0
oh my gosh , he just jumped off the bridge			2
we actually witnessed the whole thing			0
’ motorists driving over the bridge reported seeing a black @entity41 , lights still flashing , parked on the side , as an older white male climbed a pole before leaping more than 185 feet into the water			0
@entity2 had been preparing to do a sequel to his 1986 @entity47 hit @entity10			2
he and @entity47 were spotted in @entity48 , @entity49 — where the @entity51 ’s @entity10 program had been based before moving to @entity53 — meeting with @entity51 officials , a week before the suicide			2
the mystery surrounding @entity2 's death has deepened after his death certificate was released in late august - listing his cause of death as ' deferred '			1
disheveled : @entity2 was pictured looking pained as he dined out in @entity61 on july 23 instead of the expected verdict of suicide , the @entity63 @entity62 has decided to wait for toxicology and other test results and said the death is ' pending investigation '			1
the certificate states that an autopsy has been performed , that the 68 - year - old died ' under @entity13 ' - but also indicates that a biopsy was not performed on the dead body			1
there has been no confirmation from the @entity62 if the famed director of action films was suffering from cancer as some reports indicated			0
in late august , the coroner 's office said that @entity2 left a suicide note and several messages to loved ones before he jumped to his death , but none of them shed light on why he killed himself			1
coroner ’s officials also said that the notes did n’t mention any health problems , after reports circulated that the 68 - year - old may have been suffering from cancer			1
unclear : his death certificate initially failed to list a cause of death for the well - known director coroner 's office spokesman @entity101 says one of the notes left in @entity2 's black @entity41 was a list of emergency contact numbers and another found in his study included messages to friends and loved ones			1
the note in the car listed names and contact numbers - including that of his wife - so police could call his friends to tell them of his death , @entity22 reported			1
the mystery surrounding the suicide deepened after the chairman of @entity123 said that the director was ' burning with excitement ' over new projects just two weeks before his suicide			2
it also emerged that just two days before 68 - year - old @entity2 leaped to his death he had been with @entity47 discussing a sequel to their 1986 hit ' @entity10 '			1
the pair toured the @entity134 air station in @entity49 , which is home to the @entity135 where the real life @entity10 pilots complete their training			0
' we had a meeting just two weeks ago and he was burning with the excitement of creating stuff , ' said @entity143 , chairman of @entity123			0
@entity2 had more big - budget @entity145 films lined up , but his death has left them in limbo , as well as stunning his family and friends			1
coroner 's officers in @entity63 said that they were still trying to solve the suicide riffle after @entity2 's wife @entity152 said @entity153 reports that her husband had cancer were ' absolutely false '			1
brother : @entity157 is pictured here at his office in @entity145 in the days following his brothers death friends of the director said that he had no marriage or money problems and was focused on the ' @entity10 ' sequel which was preparing to go into production early next year			1
@entity2 was also in pre-production on an underwater drug - trafficking thriller ' @entity169 ' , another smuggling drama ' @entity171 ' and a remake of the 1969 western ' @entity173 '			1
while celebrity website @entity22 reported that @entity2 's wife did n't know of any serious illness that may have been a motive , it raised the possibility that the director of ' @entity11 ' may have kept his illness secret			1
if not there must have been a different reason behind his decision to leap from the @entity13 in @entity15 on sunday afternoon			2
he left a contact list of people to be informed about the tragedy in the @entity41 he abandoned before climbing a fence and jumping into the @entity188			0
the 68 - year - old director , best known for @entity10 , was said to have leaped to his death ' without hesitation ' in an effort to spare his family the pain of watching his slow death , @entity189 reported			1
but hours later , @entity189 backed away from that report and the @entity198 confirmed that @entity2 's family told the corner 's office @entity2 did not have cancer - or any major illness			1
' the family told us it is incorrect that he has inoperable brain cancer , ' @entity204 , a chief at the @entity205 told the newspaper			0
@entity22 were the first to report that @entity2 's wife @entity152 told authorities her husband was healthy , according to unnamed sources			1
@entity215 told investigators that rumors of a return of her husband 's cancer was ' absolutely false ' , @entity22 says			0
the celebrity news site also claims the preliminary results of an autopsy did not reveal the presence of cancer - though more tests are needed			2
it is believed the autopsy report could take several weeks tragic : @entity63 polie officers pulled the body of @entity2 from the water beneath the @entity13 in @entity27 , @entity6 the denial of his brain cancer begs the question - what could have driven the successful director , whose films have grossed more than $ 2 billion and who left behind a young family , to kill himself ? @entity2 's tragic death came just weeks after he was pictured looking pained as he left a @entity61 restaurant on july 23 - but friends denied he had problems in his marriage to wife @entity152			1

he put his foot on the top of the fence and paused again			0
then he threw himself off			0
i immediately thought , that guy is dead			0
