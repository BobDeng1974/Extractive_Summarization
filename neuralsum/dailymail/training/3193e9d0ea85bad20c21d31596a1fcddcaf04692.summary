conman @entity0 , who was dramatically arrested this week after a year on the run , was making millions of dollars running an online betting scheme from his @entity4 hideout , it has been revealed			1
as @entity4 television viewers were being treated to vision of his dramatic arrest , it emerged he had been using a false name to operate the business with a male friend who was sharing a rented house with him near the @entity15 resort town of @entity16			1
but @entity17 has now taken its last bet with the arrest of @entity0 , who will be extradited across the border to @entity22 to serve at least 18 months jail of a three year sentence imposed on him last year for contempt of court			1
magistrate @entity37 formally accepted @entity0 's guilty plea but did not punish him , noting that an outstanding arrest warrant allowed police to take the fugitive to a @entity42 prison to serve the outstanding prison sentence the 52 - year - old conman - who sparked the ' @entity45 ' in 2002 when he helped @entity46 purchase two flats in @entity48 at a discounted price - was said by his solicitor outside the court to have been caring for his ill mother , @entity51 , in @entity4 for the past 11 months			1
private detective @entity52 , who had been working with the television crew to track down @entity0 after many weeks of surveillance , said the conman and the other man ( named in the programme as @entity58 ) had set up @entity17 in such a way ' it was difficult to see who was operating it			2
' footage shows the man with long grey hair , a ragged beard , and barefoot footage shows officers arresting the wanted man , who has let his hair and beard grow long and grey mr @entity52 said he was pleased that @entity0 had been caught ' because he has stolen the dreams of mums and dads of @entity4			2
' the arrest of the self - styled ' international man of mischief ' made for compulsive viewing last night , with half a dozen detectives and uniformed police pouncing on @entity0 in a clump of bushes			2
it was in september last year that the @entity84 in @entity42 found @entity0 guilty of contempt for disregarding a 2005 ban on him being involved in the weight loss industry			1
the ban had been imposed after he conned a $ 6 million - about Â£ 3.5 million - from 90 investors in a nasal spray he claimed help people lose weight			2
when he failed to turn up at the @entity84 in @entity42 , he was sentenced to three years in jail , with at least 18 months of that to be served behind bars			1
@entity0 has previously been jailed in the @entity96 , the @entity97 and @entity4 because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming industry he looked dramatically different on tuesday when he was captured by a number of officers on the @entity15 coast footage from his arrest on tuesday shows officers surrounding the wanted man before pinning him to the ground @entity0 's solicitor 's comment has put into question a number of photographs he posted of himself in october last year - a week after he had been sentenced to three years jail for contempt of court - purporting to show that he was in the @entity116 nation of @entity117			1
the photographs showed him wearing a floral island - style shirt and lifting a coconut shell filled with kava			0
photos also purported to show him reading the current edition of the @entity124 and sitting near a televison set which had the current news programme playing			0
this morning solicitor mr @entity127 said outside the @entity128 magistrates court in northern @entity15 that @entity0 was still coming to terms with what he was facing			1
' he 's a it shell - shocked at the moment , but his main concern is that he gets reunited with his mother because he 's been looking after his mother for the last 11 months			2
he 's effectively been living like a monk			0
' but a news crew from @entity34 took their camera through the house that @entity0 had been renting under the false name of @entity142 and found television screens displaying the online betting club and a number of mobile phones			0
in 2002 @entity46 , wife of of former @entity96 prime minister @entity147 allegedly purchased two apartments with the help of the @entity4 conman during his time in @entity96 , he befriended @entity152 , @entity46 's fitness ' guru ' which is how he came to get close to the @entity147 family @entity0 was jailed for false advertising in the @entity96 and later faced similar punishment in the @entity97 @entity158 , pictured with @entity152 , who at the time was in a relationship with @entity0 the photos convinced many people that they were too good to have been photoshopped , but police who had been ordered to look for him following his failure to appear in court to hear the judge sentence him said they still believed he could be in @entity4			1
there was no record of him leaving the country legally through an airport or a sea port , but @entity0 claimed he had made his escape by wearing a wig and using a false passport			0
during a fierce struggle police were heard telling him to ' let go of the gun ' - his solicitor saying later that @entity0 had not realised he had grabbed one of the officer 's weapons			1
' my client 's stated he was just simply grabbing at it - it could have been a torch , ' said mr @entity127			0
as he was being led to a police car , @entity0 was seen clutching at his chest and then dropping to his knees			0
ambulance officers were called to check him over before his burly frame was lifted up onto a stretcher and he was taken to hospital for observation			0
today , when he appeared before magistrate @entity37 , @entity0 was still wearing a hospital gown			0
but by the end of the week , the man who has boasted of being behind bars in the @entity96 , @entity4 , the @entity97 and @entity197 , will be back in a more familiar outfit - a prison uniform .			0
