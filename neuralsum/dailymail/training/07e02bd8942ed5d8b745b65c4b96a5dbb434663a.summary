on his @entity25 , alongside a picture of @entity6 , he said ( translated ) : " ok we stop talking when you do not know the truth about the history of the injury @entity6 ! please ! because enough is enough ! it was his dream to go to the can with @entity4 but @entity33 decide otherwise , i was present when he was hurt ! @entity6 and i had to take the same plane to join the group but unfortunately he could not fly for six weeks ! but could play in three weeks ! the problem is that the injury he had does not support the aircraft for six weeks ! ! ! want more explanation , or you want to still keep talking ? iamdiafrasakho big brother is coming soon insha allah i do not need t say hahahaha be strong because i know you boy bandit doooryiiiii la			1
" @entity4 lodged an official complaint with @entity2 - demanding that the game ’s governing body take action			1
but @entity11 has emphatically hit back			0

the tournament in @entity70 runs until february 8 , and although @entity4 have already crashed out , @entity2 can stop @entity6 appearing for the @entity0 for the duration of the competition			1

there must be miraculous medicine in @entity94			0
‘ this sets a dangerous precedent because in future you are going to have players claiming they can not catch planes to @entity100 but who can still play football ( for their clubs )			0
it is a debate that deserves more discussion			0
’ @entity6 has come in for criticism on social media after pulling out of the tournament , with one fan writing : ‘ congratulations on your goal , i hope you never play for @entity4 again , the @entity86 people feel betrayed			2
’ @entity6 responded : ‘ i took the time to browse all your reactions on social networks			2
very quickly my joy from scoring and rescuing my club has turned into sadness and anger			0
