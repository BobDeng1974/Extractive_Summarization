@entity23 had been in the @entity17 for two years at the time of his death it was on the descent that the group heard a ' woomph ' sound , indicating that a weak layer of snow had collapsed beneath the surface			1
however , while flt sgt @entity33 sent some students back to the ridge , he concluded the snowpack was stable and the group could continue			0
two instructors stayed at the top and the students descended at 20 metre intervals with everyone intending to meet at the bottom			0
the avalanche struck while the group was halfway down the slope			2
the inquest heard that the slide was caused by sun and wind conditions , although the earlier court martial was told that it could have been triggered by the serviceman skiing over the unstable service in too large groups			1
many of the 23 servicemen were either at the bottom or within their final stages of descent when the 400 metres wide and 200 metres long avalanche hit			2
along with @entity23 , @entity103 and @entity104 were also caught up in the collapse			0
@entity103 was only buried up to his waist and managed for free himself and while @entity104 was completely covered apart from his hand , he was quickly pulled free			2
@entity23 was ' completely buried ' and it took nine minutes later to find him , by which point he was not breathing			1
his comrades tried to revive him and rescue helicopters were sent to the scene but @entity23 was declared dead on the mountainside			2

@entity123 , defence counsel , said : ' this is adventurous training and not a leisure facility			2
the purpose was to make a journey and hopefully get to the next hut , ' he said , adding that ' rules are not to be adhered to slavishly			0
' at the end of the four - week court martial in july 2012 , the six - member board acquitted flt sgt @entity33			1
two other servicemen were caught in the avalanche , but were pulled out in time			2
it was nine minutes before @entity23 was dragged clear of the snow , by which point he had died @entity23 had driven armoured vehicles in @entity29 and was one of the last @entity9 servicemen to leave @entity3 at the time of his death , @entity23 - who had joined the armed forces in 2008 - was praised as a ' brave and determined ' gunner who had been one of the last @entity9 servicemen to leave @entity3			1

in a statement released by his family at the time of his death they said : ' we wish to convey how proud we were of him and we knew how proud he was about being in the @entity17			2

the inquest was told that 11 of the recommendations had been fully implemented and a further four were underway			0
a @entity173 spokesman told @entity184 : ' our thoughts remain with @entity23 ’s family and friends at this difficult time			0
