pictures taken at the dawn of photography depicting pretty seaside towns in the @entity4 show just how little has changed on the coast since the 19th century			1
captured by @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , the stunning landscapes have scarcely changed since when they were taken between 1860 and 1880			1

the curving beach - front street is still instantly recognisable from the photograph taken in the 1800s which was among the first collection of black - and - white images of the area the three men took photos of @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , and pretty @entity18 in @entity19 , which has noticeably fewer houses in its 1870s guise but still looks strikingly similar today			1
another photo of @entity41 , near @entity42 , also shows how time has stood still on the iconic tidal island , with the steep summit and country house sitting atop it looking exactly as it does now			0
pictures of @entity49 in @entity37 however tell a different story as they were taken before the devastating flood of 1952 which killed 34 people			1
the river has since been re-routed and hundreds of houses built			0
the four albums are to be sold on october 9 at @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , where they are expected to fetch around Â£ 500			2
@entity60 has barely changed in more than 100 years with the spires of @entity62 poking out from behind the waterside @entity64 @entity65 in @entity49 , @entity37 , remains at the focal point of both images of the esplanade taken from sea			1
while more houses have popped up in the woodland behind it the tower , the view of the coastal town is very much the same a different view of the seafront town @entity49 taken from the @entity78 shows a similar landscape			1
much of the area was devastated by the 1952 flood which claimed the lives of more than 30 people an early photograph of @entity49 shows the @entity85 flowing between houses and buildings in the 1900s			1
parts of the river had to be rerouted following the flood in 1952 , with roads and houses cropping up in its place ( pictured top ) @entity41 in @entity42 has scarcely changed since 1900 with the exception of a causeway which is only accessible when there is a low tide			1
the rocky island is still home to a small community , with a 14th century @entity104 sitting proudly at its peak a family of women are captured at @entity108 in @entity18 in the 1880s while they work and play ( left )			1
the distinctive concrete arch seen in the photograph is still present today ( right ) the town 's harbour is depicted in the above photographs taken in 2014 and in the 1880s , showing how many homes have been erected since			2
the bell tower at @entity118 can be seen in both @entity119 in north @entity37 is very much the same today as it appeared in the late 19th century , with houses perched on a steep hill before the waterfront in the fishing village @entity126 @entity125 said : ' @entity9 and @entity8 were two of the great @entity128 pioneers of commercial @entity128 landscape photography			2
' in the decades before the picture postcard , the coastlines , villages and local people of @entity37 and @entity19 presented these photographers with endless possibilities to practise their art and to make money			0
' their documentation of the changing @entity140 scene formed an invaluable record and it is striking for us now to see what has changed and what has stayed the same			2
' the sepia tones and the figures that populate some of these photos add a haunting melancholy feel that is completely captivating			0
' @entity8 , who compiled the book , was the first photographer to ever be invited on an official royal tour after visiting @entity151 with the @entity152 in 1862 at the request of @entity155 @entity154			0
