@entity0 : @entity1 was sent to @entity3 's camps when he was just 11 years old			1
in this picture , taken after he was liberated , he is 14 in february of 1945 @entity1 , 13 , was standing in the snow cold , hungry , desperate , and dimly aware that under normal circumstances it would be time for his bar mitzvah			1
but instead of a celebration , @entity1 , staring through the fence of @entity10 , a @entity12 concentration camp , had been put to work for months on end with nothing more than thin prison clothes to protect him from the bitter winter , and a slice of bread a day to sustain him			1
remembering his desperation , @entity1 , now 81 , recalls : ' the camp was in the middle of the forest , and a fence ran through the trees			1
i was praying to @entity31 “ help me , if you let me get out of this place , i shall not ask anything else of you in my life			0
” ' but his liberation was not to come for months , when the @entity35 soldiers would sweep into @entity36 and , horrified , stumble upon the hellish camps where @entity1 and millions like him were held			1
so @entity1 , suffering not only from terrible deprivation and could , but a typhus infection , worked on through the winter			1
the gruelling regime hit him especially badly as , having pretended to be older than he was to avoid being killed , he had to do the work of an adult to keep up the act			1
@entity1 , a @entity45 , was imprisoned in 1944 , after his country had been occupied by the @entity47 for attempting to defect to the @entity48			1
transported : @entity1 was forced on to a crowded railway car and transported to @entity50 in awful conditions ( file picture ) he , his parents and his eight siblings were sent first to @entity55 , where women and children would be separated from men , and killed			1
@entity1 was saved because he mother ordered him to join the adults despite still being a boy			1
the decision saved his life , as his mother and seven of his siblings died in the camps			2
' of course at the start , i ran over to my mother 's side , with the children and the women ' , @entity1 says			1
' i told her : “ i want to come with you , mum			0
” she said : “ no , do n't come here			0
” ' he pleaded but gave in and joined one of his brothers in the other line			0
however , even then he was almost sent back to die by the notorious @entity55 camp dr @entity82			1
' i could see a @entity36 officer with white gloves ' , @entity1 says , ' who we heard later on was dr @entity82			2
he was pointing left and right			0
and as he came to me , he suddenly stopped and said “ how old are you ? ” ' remembering what i was told , i said i was 16			2
fortunately i was big for my age			0
' i 've often , even now after all these years , i can remember his eyes as he was thinking to himself which side he should put me to			0
he must have thought that if i 'm lying i wo n't be strong enough so it does n't matter			0
' in @entity10 for the bitterest months of the year , @entity1 's strength was sorely tested			1
an average meal in the camp was a slice of bread , a cup of hot water and , perhaps , a dab of margarine			2
to protect them from the weather , prisoners had only the infamous black - and - white striped prisoner underclothes and a thin cotton overcoat			0
desperate : these @entity109 survivors , mostly children , were photographed when @entity55 was liberated ( file picture ) @entity111 : children were kept in horrible conditions inside the camps alongside hundreds of others , he was put to work on gruelling projects such as digging underground bases for military equipment with only rudimentary tools			1
order was kept with a combination of fear and extreme force			0
when @entity12 guards realised some prisoners were hiding in a cave to avoid work , they thought nothing of throwing grenades in after them			1
when a register of prisoners was taken in the morning , everyone faced an agonising decision of which group of labourers to join			0
some tasks were easier than others – and the hardest work could easily drive struggling prisoners to death			2
one day @entity1 made a different choice to his brother , and did n't see him for three weeks			1
while his brother was posted to a farm , and allowed to eat decently for a time , @entity1 grew so emaciated and ill that his older sibling did not recognise him			1
marched : @entity149 , marked with a @entity150 , queue on their way into @entity55 in 1944 , the same time @entity1 was taken to the camps ( file picture ) work : children are seen behind barbed wire in @entity55 indeed , at one point @entity1 's typhus , which was ubiquitous in concentration camps , grew so bad he was referred to the camp hospital			1
' the hospital block was laughable ' , @entity1 recalls			2
' twice a day – in the morning a camp doctor would come along , you would uncover yourself , he 'd see how much flesh you had on you , whether you were able to work			2
' those who were not considered workable were pointed towards , and those people had to be taken away to be killed			2
all of us would push our stomach out to pretend we were more healthy than we were			0
' with the help of his brother , @entity1 sneaked out of the hospital , where there was clearly no prospect of getting better			1
haunting : a recent images shows a wintery @entity55 as it is now , with the infamous slogan ' @entity175 ' written above the gate but outside , in the camp , things began to change , as the noise of @entity181 war planes gradually began to fill the air			1
but for those still inside , it was n't a symbol of hope			0
' they said the worse the @entity36 treated us the more we were losing the war , ' @entity1 remembers			2
and indeed , the worst was yet to come			0
after weeks of restlessness in the camp , the order was given that it be abandoned			0
@entity1 and his brother were told that they must march , for days , to a larger camp			1
recollection : @entity1 , pictured recently , was able to start a new life in @entity198 they were given a single loaf of bread to sustain them for several days , and warned that if they finished it too soon there would be nothing else			2
part way through this gruelling journey , with a pace so uncompromising prisoners would die on their feet , it became too much			0
' we were walking along in the mud and suddenly my brother and i accused each other of taking bigger bites than we should have done , ' @entity1 remembers			1
' we started fighting and wrestling in the mud			0
' ' and as we were fighting in the mud suddenly i could see a pair of army boots and the butt of a gun on the floor			0
' the two thought – with good reason – they would soon be brutally punished			0
' then suddenly we heard this soldier talking to us in @entity45 ' , @entity1 says			1
' he said “ do n't fight , because you 'll soon be liberated and then afterwards you 'll be sorry you fought each other			0
” ' that was about the only kindness that i experienced in my camp life			0
' even this was only a blip in the otherwise unrelenting suffering of @entity1 's year under @entity12 persecution			1
but , as he marched towards @entity242 , where he would soon be liberated by the @entity35 forces , it was a sign of better things to come			0
after the war , @entity1 was granted a visa to come to the @entity198			2
he spent his working life in fashion retail , married and has four children and six grandchildren			0
@entity1 shared his story in conjunction with the @entity253			2
