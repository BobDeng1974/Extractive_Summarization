@entity2 ' fluorescent peroxide blond hairstyle from 2007 was voted his biggest style shocker in a poll he may be a champ on the field , a doting father to four children and dutiful husband , but @entity2 is less successful when it comes to fashion			1
from garish hairstyles to bizarre clothes choices , he 's committed his fair share of ' embarrassing dad ' style crimes			2
ahead of his 40th birthday in may , a new poll has revealed @entity2 ' worst fashion fails			2
his biggest style shocker was his fluorescent peroxide blond hairstyle when he was playing for @entity22 in 2007 , which contrasted starkly with a slight burned tan			1
in second place is the matching his - and - hers @entity26 leather outfits worn with @entity27 in 1999			1
in third place was the famous cornrow hairstyle from 2003 , which showed off inches of pink scalp			1
the dodgy sarong @entity2 showcased at the @entity33 while again out with his wife - complete with clunky leather slide - ons - came fourth			1
in fifth place was his now deeply unfashionable ' curtains ' haircut he had during the years when he was first dating @entity27 back in 1996			1
plenty of gel meant his locks were permanently shiny and finely separated			0
and in sixth place was the bushier beard he grew five years ago , which looked more ' i have n't slept in days ' than stylishly manly			2
thankfully , the football star prefers to crop his beard more closely these days			0
the father - of - four is often considered somewhat of a @entity50 style icon , but as well as often hitting the right note , he 's certainly tried and failed many times			2
his seventh biggest howler was the spiky highlighted hair he had in 2002 shortly before leaving @entity56			0
in eighth place was his mohican haircut from 2001 and coming in at ninth place was the disastrous , misspelled @entity61 tattoo in tribute to his wife @entity27 from 2002			1
when translated , it spelled ' @entity66 '			0
in second place is the matching @entity26 his - and - hers leather outfits worn with wife @entity27 in 1999 ( left ) while the dodgy sarong ( left ) he wore at the @entity33 out with his wife came fourth another hairstyle from @entity2 ' @entity22 years is his tenth fashion fail - this time , it was the ponytail he wore to control his growing locks in 2003			1
@entity2 ' fashion disasters were chosen in a poll of 1,000 people by the menswear brand @entity79			0
@entity2 has freely admitted to some spectacular fashion fails in the past - not least those leather jackets			2
he has said : ' what were we thinking			0
i look back on some of the stuff and think , " i ca n't believe i actually wore that			2
" ' i have no regrets , though - i knew at the time it was good ! ' maybe i 've sometimes overstepped the mark with something that a footballer in the past would n't wear , and that 's led to trends or people trying new things			1
' some people would probably look at me wearing the sarong - that 's been mentioned so many times over the years			1
but i thought it was great			0
' @entity2 's famous cornrow hairstyle ( left ) from 2003 was voted third worst look and his deeply unfashionable gelled ' curtains ' haircut ( left ) from 1996 came in at fifth place in sixth place was the bushier beard he grew five years ago , which looked more ' i have n't slept in days ' than stylish ( left ) and his seventh biggest howler was the spiky highlighted hair he rocked in 2002 ( right ) @entity2 is a firm champion of self - expression , which sounds like a promise of further fashion howlers from our national hero			1
' everyone should be allowed to be who they are and dress how they want , ' he said			0
@entity2 said he was adventurous with fashion choices even as a child			0
he explained : ' i was a pageboy and had a choice between wearing a boring old suit or a pair of knickerbockers with ballerina tights and slippers			0
i went with the tights			0
' @entity131 , founder of @entity50 young menswear e-tailer @entity132 , said @entity2 remained a style icon for millions of men and he should be applauded for his boldness when it comes to fashion			0
@entity131 said : ' @entity2 has done more to improve the dress sense of @entity50 men than probably any other man this century			0
1 going platinum blond in 2007 while playing for @entity22			1
2 @entity2 and @entity27 's matching leather jackets at the @entity26 launch in 1999			1
3 his cornrow hairstyle from 2003			1

5 the curtains haircut he had when he was first dating wife @entity27 way back in 1997			1
6 the bushier beard he wore in 2009			2
7 the spiky highlighted hair he had around 2002			0

9 the disastrous @entity61 tattoo which misspelled wife @entity27 's name			1
10 the ponytail haircut he had while playing for @entity22 in 2003			2
@entity2 's @entity154 look ( 2001 ) was only voted eighth worst fail , while his misspelled 2002 tattoo came in ninth @entity2 ' tenth fashion fail is the double ponytail he wore to control his growing locks in 2003 ' but it is notable that only one of his top ten fashion fails has come in the last five years - his rather unfortunate bushy beard			1
' the fact is , @entity2 is now a father - of - four who will be celebrating his 40th birthday in may			0
' he looks as good as ever but there is no doubt that his sense of style is becoming far more conservative			0
' he changes his hairstyle a lot less frequently and has a well - cropped beard more or less constantly			2
' you ca n't imagine him ever having a @entity179 again or going platinum blond			0
' i 'd love to see the sarong - wearing @entity2 re-emerge in his 40s to shake things up again			0
' i guess you have to ask whether the big brands he represents these days want one of their ambassadors sporting a @entity179			0
' as he approaches the big 4 - 0 , @entity2 's sure to have lots more style blunders up his sleeve .			0
