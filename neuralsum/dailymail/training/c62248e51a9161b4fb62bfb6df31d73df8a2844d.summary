when @entity1 is not helping make components for @entity4 ’s car he scores goals , plenty of them , and sometimes in great style			1
not content with the two goals that knocked former winners @entity11 out of the @entity14 first round , the @entity9 forward followed that up last weekend with a wonder strike that drew unlikely comparisons with @entity18 and @entity19			1
the opposition might only have been @entity21 in the @entity22 but his ‘ rabona ’ chip of the goalkeeper was a breathtaking piece of skill that has proved a viral internet hit the world over , with nearly two million hits on social media			1
@entity1 ( centre ) celebrates scoring the first goal for @entity9 against @entity11 @entity1 pictured outside his work where he has made components for @entity37 cars it has all added up to a slightly disconcerting few weeks for the 22 - year - old former @entity40 trainee , who works as a turner at specialist engineering firm @entity42 in the industrial heartlands of the @entity44 , down the road from @entity48 ’s @entity47 stadium			1
in the reception area is a @entity51 poster , signed by @entity4 and @entity52 , sent out to the contractors who made contributions to this year ’s @entity37 championship success			1
yet if they thought their contribution to the sporting world would end with doing some bodywork on @entity4 ’s winning car , they reckoned without the magnetism of the @entity14 , which sees their employee travel with @entity9 to @entity65 today for the second round			1
and then there was the footage of the @entity21 goal going global			1
for @entity1 , who lives a short cycle ride to work , notoriety has taken some getting used to			1
‘ suddenly i ’m getting messages from all over , from a mate who lives in @entity74 , where they ’ve been talking about it apparently , and a friend who is at university in @entity79 , ’ he says			2
‘ there has been a lot about it on @entity83			2
i ’m on @entity83 but do n’t really know it works			2
‘ the rabona is just something i ’ve played around with since i was about eight			1
if i try it in training , a few people tell me to stop messing about			2
but i did n’t really think about it last weekend , it was just something i did on instinct			2
‘ it has been a bit weird and i ’m not really used to this			2
i ’m used to just living a quiet life and getting on with my work and my football			2
’ the day after knocking out @entity11 in front of more than 3,000 travelling @entity9 fans , @entity1 was back in the factory for his shift , which begins at six o’clock each morning			1
@entity1 ( right ) pictured alongside his mother @entity104 ( left ) who also works for the same company as her son @entity1 pictured operating some machinery at his workplace , @entity110 in @entity111 in an era when even non-league players can live off their wages , and sometimes opt not to do much outside their training more strenuous than @entity116 , he is decidedly old school , a proper working man			1
he helps operate the complex moulding machines , learning the trade at the factory where his mum , @entity104 , has worked for seven years , and will sometimes work on saturday mornings before a home fixture			1
‘ we got back from @entity11 and i went to my local pub for a pint but i could n’t really celebrate because i knew i was getting up early in the morning , ’ he says			1
‘ that does n’t bother me			2
i enjoy working and i know that whatever happens football can be a short career			2
‘ i could probably live off my football money but i ’m saving for a deposit to buy a house			0
everyone in the factory is football mad and talks about it all the time but , to be honest , i ’m not that interested in the game other than i just love playing it			0
i do n’t watch much or follow a team			0
’ how much longer he will happily toil away on the shopfloor is unclear because his goalscoring record and what happened against @entity21 has alerted a host of @entity147 clubs			1
‘ i ’d still love to get back into the professional game and i ’m aware that this weekend is another chance to be in the shop window , ’ he says			0
@entity1 is preparing for @entity9 's @entity14 second round game against @entity65 his previous experience of the big time was two years spent at @entity154 as a teenager , where he played in the same teams as @entity158 and @entity159			1
‘ @entity158 was a quiet lad , he was a bit older than me but i was always playing two years above myself so i did n’t know him that well			0
@entity159 was totally the opposite			0
‘ i shared a room with him a few times , they put me in with him because i ’m fairly quiet and sensible and they thought i would calm him down			0
he just wanted to do practical jokes all the time			0
he used to cut my socks off and things like that but i liked him			0
‘ @entity158 was something different , you could tell he was going to be very good			0
@entity159 is also one of the best i ’ve seen			0
if only he knew how good he could be , the way he goes past players and reads the game , he could be playing for @entity177 by now			0
’ having started at @entity11 , @entity1 was at @entity178 from 14 to 16 before moving closer to home for a three - year contract with @entity181			1
‘ i fell out with the manager there			0
he said we were playing well when we were losing a game 4 - 1 to @entity186 and we had an argument			0
he sent me away on loan			0
’ @entity1 is a former @entity40 trainee and grew up alongside the likes of @entity158 ( centre ) he also grew up with @entity159 ( left ) who has since moved on to play for @entity191 and @entity192 after ending up at @entity193 , earlier this season he moved to @entity9 , where he has already scored nine goals in 17 games			1
they lie eighth in their league , although these have been uncertain times at the club , who are currently having to groundshare with @entity202			0
despite that there is a new enthusiasm around and they will not lack for support at @entity65 , who are fourth from bottom in @entity209			0
‘ at @entity11 the fans were unbelievable , singing from start to finish , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ it was the definitely the best moment for me in football and it makes us believe we can go further			0
