@entity1 manager @entity0 is set to escape further punishment from the @entity3 following his rant after monday night 's defeat by @entity6			1
the south @entity8 club were denied a clear penalty inside the opening 25 seconds after @entity11 fouled @entity12 in the box			1
@entity0 was furious with the decision and let his feeling be known after the clash saying : ' i think everyone knows it 's a penalty , the referee says he has n't seen it , but he is in a great position			1
@entity12 is brought down by @entity11 but @entity22 did n't give @entity1 a penalty @entity0 complains to @entity22 but the @entity1 manager will not be punished for his post-match outburst ' i think the only chance we have of getting a penalty at the moment is somebody picking the ball up and throwing it at the referee			1
it 's so disappointing when you 've played so well			0
' even with the second ( penalty appeal ) one with @entity36			2
it might be on the edge of the box but they have given a goal kick			0
' we are going to @entity44 on saturday , we wo n't get many decisions there i suppose ? on another night , major decisions change games - and in the last couple of weeks we 've had major decisions go against us			0
@entity50 was shown a second yellow card for this foul on @entity53 as @entity1 finished with ten men @entity53 fires home for @entity6 as @entity57 's team beat @entity1 at @entity58 ' i said to the fourth official : " how does it feel when you see you 've made a mistake			2
" he said : " it hurts			0
" so there will be one or two people hurting tonight			0
' they ( the decisions ) get you the points , the assault on @entity74 at @entity75 when we were 2 - 0 up and cruising , and @entity78 's penalty there			2
tonight , you wo n't get a clearer penalty than that , the defender 's just taken his legs			0
' you can see it clearly , they should be simple decisions for top class ( referees ) , we are talking about the @entity88 - the best in the world - so i do n't understand it			0
@entity0 is already facing an @entity3 charge for his comments about referees after defeat to @entity96 last month ' it 's no good speaking to @entity98 or anything is it ? we were told we should appeal more , but i ca n't see appealing anymore making a difference , can you ? ' the @entity3 have been made aware of the comments , but it is understood @entity0 will not face disciplinary action			1
