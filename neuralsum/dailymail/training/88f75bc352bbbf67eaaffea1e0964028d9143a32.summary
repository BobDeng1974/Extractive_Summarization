she said : ' just one word could have ended @entity7 's life , but there 's no way on earth i would have done that			1
not when she 's the one who had saved my life			2

incredibly , the tumour had shrunk from 9cm to 5cm , while the cancer on her lymph nodes had been reduced by half			1
the remainder of her treatment was put on hold until @entity7 was born , as a second round of chemotherapy could potentially harm her			1

i called @entity55 and he grabbed the clippers and that was it			0
we shaved my head and i toasted my new look with a glass of champagne			0
' after weeks of gruelling chemotherapy , her next scan came in july , where she discovered the tumour had disappeared completely			1
but she still needed 25 external sessions of radiotherapy across her pelvis , as well as more chemotherapy to blast the cancerous cells still left in her body			2
she said : ' i was whacked but @entity55 made me laugh every day , and he was always there for me			0
' seeing my daughters ' smiles made the fight worthwhile			0
priorities : she said : ' i used to be career orientated , but being a mum is my priority now ' ' at times i felt vulnerable and ugly , but the nurses in the radiation unit were great			0
it 's not always been easy , and there are times when @entity7 , now 11 months old , and @entity54 , now 22 months old , are at the dinner table and there are peas flying everywhere and both of them are crying			1
