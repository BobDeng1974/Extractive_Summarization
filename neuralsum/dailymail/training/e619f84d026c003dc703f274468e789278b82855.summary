a 43 - year - old man caught hacking out chunks of an ancient @entity3 redwood to sell for furniture has been ordered to pay $ 11,000 restitution			1
@entity6 must also undertake 700 hours of community service as part of his one - year suspended sentence for poaching burls from trees in @entity12			1
the @entity3 man was one of two people convicted of felony vandalism after rangers tracked slabs cut from the redwood to a furniture shop last year			1
park rangers say burl poaching has been going on for years due to high unemployment and drug addiction , as the knobby growths can fetch thousands of dollars			1
according to a @entity41 statement , @entity6 and @entity35 were arrested following a year - long investigation			1
on april 19 last year , a bear researcher in the park discovered giant burls cut off a a 10 - foot thick old growth redwood tree just south of the mouth of the @entity48			1
the cut left a scar measuring 8 feet by 10 feet			0
over the course of weeks , the thieves cut the burl into slabs weighing more than 100 pounds each that they dragged behind @entity56 through the woods several hundred yards to a road			2
an anonymous tip led to the discovery of the burls at a local shop in @entity63			2
after matching the wood to pieces left behind at the scarred tree , investigators seized the slabs			0
the dealer had paid $ 1,600 for eight slabs that he was going to sell for $ 700 apiece , for a total of $ 5,600			2
@entity72 indicated that @entity6 had been in possession of the burls taken from the site , and then sold them to the shop			1
the burl shop was not investigated			2
authorities say unemployment and drug addiction have spurred an increase in the destructive practice of cutting off the knobby growths at the base of ancient redwood trees to make decorative pieces like lacey - grained coffee tables and wall clocks			1
the practice — known as burl poaching — has become so prevalent along the @entity3 coast that @entity12 now closes the popular @entity93 at night in a desperate attempt to deter thieves			1
law enforcement ranger @entity96 said that poachers have been stalking the remote reaches of the park with their chain saws and @entity56 for decades , but lately the size and frequency of thefts have been on the rise			2
environmental damage : @entity108 @entity107 shows the damage from redwood burl poaching in @entity36 , @entity3 ' when i interview suspects , that is the ( reason ) they say : their addiction to drugs and they ca n't find jobs , ' she said			1
her husband , park district interpretation supervisor @entity107 , said it is comparable to poor people poaching rare rhinos in @entity122 to sell their horns			0
jobs are hard to come by since the timber and commercial fishing industries went into decline			0
' originally there were two million acres of old growth forest that spanned the coast of @entity3 from @entity132 to @entity133 , ' he said			0
' over the past 150 years , 95 percent of that original forest has been cut			0
the only remaining old growth forest in existence now is almost entirely within the @entity12 national park ' and some state parks			2
a redwood tree can survive the practice , but the legacy of the organism that could be 1,000 years old is threatened , because the burl is where it sprouts a clone before dying			2
@entity146 : the ancient redwoods in @entity3 's @entity12 are about 400 feet tall and 1000 years old sprouting from burls is the prevalent method of redwood propagation , and the source of the @entity154 name for coast redwood , @entity157 semper vierens , or forever living , he added			1
@entity158 is a burl dealer in @entity159 , @entity132			0
he occasionally goes to @entity3 to buy burl , but it is tough to find any more , with almost all of the old growth that makes the best burls protected on public land			1
the good stuff with a lacey grain full of eyes will go for $ 2 to $ 3 a pound , unseasoned			0
finished dining room tables are being offered for $ 1,300 on @entity171			0
' i do n't buy them unless they have proof of where they got it , ' he said			0
' i 've got to have a paper trail			0
if there 's not a paper trail , it can stay in their yard			0
' with few law enforcement rangers — and 133,000 acres of park stretching south from the headquarters in @entity190 , @entity3 — to patrol , arrests are rare , @entity96 said			1
she can recall two or three over the past 12 years			0
while charges can be felonies carrying prison time , convictions usually end up as misdemeanors carrying fines .			0

@entity199 cut burls off redwoods at @entity12 in @entity3 and sold them to a shop
he must complete 700 hours community service as part of his one - year suspended sentence
@entity35 , 34 , also pleaded guilty to vandalism charges
he was sentenced to three years probation and ordered to pay $ 1600 restitution
park rangers say burl poachers make thousands selling the ancient wood to furniture shops and dealers
the cuts leave the 1,000 - year - old trees *vulnerable* to fire and *disease*
