@entity0 was pleasantly surprised by @entity2 's performance at the @entity4 @entity3 despite the fact both he and @entity6 failed to finish the race			1
the @entity2 pair began the race with @entity0 17th and @entity6 18th but were involved in a battle in the middle of the pack for the first half of the race			1
@entity6 was forced to retire , though , after being called in by his team after 21 laps while @entity0 lasted double the amount of time as his team - mate			1
@entity0 was happy to see @entity2 be more competitive at the @entity4 @entity3 @entity6 only lasted 21 laps in @entity22 in his first race of the 2015 season @entity0 seen on the tail of @entity27 driver @entity26 at the @entity28 but @entity0 was happy to see his team challenging again after a lonely @entity29 @entity3 where he could only manage to nurse the car home			1
he told @entity32 : ' i would rather this way around ( being forced to retire ) than get to the end and be nowhere			2
' we were quicker than the @entity37			2
the @entity38 was there and the @entity40 was n't that much quicker			0
it was a nice surprise but it was also good to see where our strengths and weaknesses were compared to the rest of the cars			0
' it was interesting to race with other people and a little bit unexpected			0
it was n't so bad , it was just a little bit messy with the pit stop and safety car			0

both @entity2 drivers forced to retire at @entity4 @entity3
@entity6 was called in by his team after 21 laps in @entity22
@entity0 lasted double the time his @entity60 team - mate did
@entity0 , nevertheless , pleased and surprised to challenge *midfield*
