by @entity1 reporter published : 09:48 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 18:21 est , 13 february 2013 a representative for @entity3 has responded to the outrage over his outfit yesterday that appeared to resemble traditional hasidic jewish clothing			1
the designer , who was fired from @entity8 in march 2011 after several drunken outbursts and anti-semitic remarks in a @entity12 cafe , was seen before the @entity14 show yesterday in a long black jacket , charcoal homburg - style hat and hair in the style of twirled peyos - long sidelocks grown to demonstrate faith			1
but this evening , his spokesperson @entity22 insisted that the look was nothing more than a high fashion one , and that any suggestion that it was a comment on the @entity28 community is ' totally inaccurate '			0
controversial clothing : @entity3 made a small but loud return to the fashion word yesterday , making his way to @entity14 's @entity34 show dressed in an outfit that resembled @entity28 @entity37 clothing ' mr @entity3 has worn big hats and has had long curly hair for many years , ' she told @entity41			1
' he was in designer attire from head - to - toe including a @entity45 hat and @entity47 pants			2
' ms @entity22 did not issue any kind of apology for yesterday 's outfit , but did state that mr @entity3 ' continues to be committed to making amends and seeking forgiveness from the @entity37 community for his insensitive remarks two years ago			1
' she added that ' he remains focused on his sobriety daily ' and ' has met with @entity37 leaders around the world ... ' [ @entity60 ] continues to make a sincere and heartfelt effort to understand his actions and demonstrate his contrition			2
' mr @entity3 , who had been helping @entity14 prepare for last night 's fall 2013 collection , shocked @entity66 's @entity37 community with his enseble yesterday			1
' mr @entity3 has worn big hats and has had long curly hair for many years			1
he was in designer attire from head - to - toe ' @entity72 community leader @entity71 told the @entity73 : ' he ’s trying to embarrass people in the @entity37 community and make money on clothes [ while ] dressed like people he has insulted			1
' it looks like the hairstyle he added was done purposely to insult , ' he added			0
' i would invite mr. @entity14 and @entity3 to come to @entity72 , @entity83 , so i can show them some @entity86 survivors and the clothes they [ wear ]			2
' meanwhile rabbi and fashion designer @entity88 commented : ' this was not very smart , unless he really wants attention			0
i ’m hoping that this is not in any way a mockery through this attire			0
' because @entity3 was nowhere to be seen front - of - house at @entity14 ’s tuesday night show , with visitors unable to enter backstage , it is unclear if the controversial outfit was seen by fashion industry critics at the event			2
but after the incident at @entity12 ' @entity106 cafe , in which @entity3 was video - recorded saying ' i love @entity109 , ' before telling an @entity111 woman , who was n't @entity37 : ' people like you would be dead			1
your mothers , your forefathers , would all be f * * * * * * gassed , ' being seen publicly in the distinguishing outfit was enough to ruffle feathers			0
fashion friends : @entity3 ( left ) returned to the fashion word , temporarily , with a three week stint at @entity14 's ( right ) studio in the lead up to his @entity122 show @entity83 assemblyman @entity123 said : ' who is he mocking ? the way the socks look , the jacket , the peyos			1
my question is , who ’s he laughing at ? ' if it was just anyone else , i would n’t know what to say			0
but considering who this guy is , considering his background and what he ’s said in the past , let him explain it to all of us : are you mocking us ? ' @entity142 users have also expressed their thoughts on mr @entity3 's outfit choice , which many found ' insulting ' and ' shameful '			1
beauty blogger @entity146 wrote : ' @entity3 - why ? the @entity147 that @entity14 built is giving you a chance - must you mock it ? ' ' is @entity3 really so talented that the world must put up with his shameful antics ? ' another tweeted : ' is @entity3 really so talented that the world must put up with his shameful antics ? ' but the fashion industry appears to be coming to the designer 's defense			1
@entity156 , ceo of the @entity157 , said the attacks against the designer were ' unfair			0
' he tweeted this morning : ' that is @entity3 's hair and how he dresses and certainly not a mockery of others , ' before adding , ' lets all take a deep breath , relax and remember it 's just clothes ! ' others disagreed			1
@entity169 replied to mr @entity156 , tweeting : ' show me [ a ] few more pics of him dressed like that over the past couple months , years and i 'll consider that pov			0
' @entity3 , who faced a maximum of six months in jail on charges of ' public insults based on origin , religious affiliation , race or ethnicity , ' blamed work - related stress and multiple substance addictions for his @entity12 outbursts , which he says he can not remember			1
he was stripped of his @entity185 and ordered to pay suspended fines of 6,000 euros , as well as symbolic damages and costs to each of his victims and to five anti-racism groups who were also complainants			0
fashion comeback : @entity3 was en route to @entity14 's fall 2013 @entity34 show held last night ; which @entity3 spent three weeks helping the designer prepare but two years later , @entity3 , who designed @entity199 ' wedding dress in july 2011 , seemed hopeful to reintegrate himself into the fashion industry after his fall from grace - the first step being a three week stint at @entity14 's studio in the lead up to his @entity122 show			1
' i am an alcoholic , ' @entity3 admitted to @entity208 last month , before explaining his readiness a return to the industry			2
' i have been in recovery for the past two years ... i remain committed to making amends to those i have hurt			0
' several years prior to my sobriety , i descended into the madness of the disease			0
i said and did things which hurt others , especially members of the @entity37 community			1
i have expressed my sorrow privately and publicly for the pain which i caused , and i continue to do so			0
' ' that is @entity3 's hair and how he dresses and certainly not a mockery of others ... lets all take a deep breath , relax and remember it 's just clothes ! ' the @entity232 issued a statement defending the designer today , saying : ' there is no truth to [ the ] accusation that @entity3 was dressed in @entity28 garb , and anyone familiar with the dress of traditional @entity241 should not mistake what @entity3 is wearing in the photograph as ‘ hasidic garb			1
' @entity245 do not wear fedora hats , pinstripe pants , blue jackets or an ascot tie , ' he wrote			0
@entity14 , who called @entity3 an ' immense talent , ' also said last month : ' i think @entity3 is doing all the right things			2
everyone in life deserves a second chance , especially someone as talented as @entity3			2
i think that life is about forgiving and helping people			0
… i think @entity3 is doing all the right things			2
' whether or not yesterday 's outfit constitutes ' doing the right thing , ' is debatable , however			0
one observing @entity261 resident told @entity41 : ' @entity262 is so deluded that he thinks wearing an outfit inspired by the dress of @entity28 is some kind of apology , or it is simply another callous insult from someone who is already known as a drunken anti-semite			0
either way he 's an a * * hole			0
