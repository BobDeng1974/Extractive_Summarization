@entity1 trolls who made rape threats against @entity5 ’s daughter were yesterday warned they face police action			1
her father @entity7 told those tormenting his family over the @entity12 rape case : ‘ @entity13 awaits you			1
’ his daughter @entity15 , 27 , said : ‘ to the trolls wishing rape on me , stop , you are utterly pathetic			1
’ her mother had sparked the storm by saying footballer @entity12 had not physically harmed the teenager he raped in a hotel			1
campaigners said her comments perpetuated harmful myths about rape and the 66 - year - old had to issue an unreserved apology			1
the furore saw vile @entity1 abuse directed at @entity15 , including the threat : ‘ @entity5 ’s given me her blessing to rape you			1
’ another tweet , directed at her mother , said : ‘ hope you discover first hand what rape is like you idiot			2
’ @entity15 said : ‘ my mother was voicing an opinion on the matter of criminals being accepted back into society			2
‘ the comments she made on the case in question were facts , so not opinions			0
while it may anger some that the term “ non-violent rape ” exists , unfortunately it does			0
referencing it and explaining why that was the charge does not mean that you think this category of rape is acceptable			0
‘ to believe that my mother is pro “ non-violent rape ” is ridiculous and i am shocked that many people have jumped to this conclusion			0
to the trolls wishing rape on me , stop , you are utterly pathetic			1
’ @entity12 , 25 , who was jailed in 2012 and will be released next week , has ' served his time ' , miss @entity5 said @entity15 posted a note on @entity1 defending her mother , and revealed she had been threatened with rape mr @entity7 , 58 , yesterday suggested the family would report the trolls to police			1
‘ i have noted every sick troll threat , ’ said the tv presenter			1
‘ do they really think it ’s ok to wish / threaten rape on a woman ? they ’re in deep trouble , trust me			0
‘ thanks to everyone who tweeted support for @entity5 ’s intelligent , clear analysis today			2
trolls who sent sick rape threats ? @entity13 awaits you			1
’ @entity112 has not yet opened an investigation but social media users have been prosecuted before for attacks on high - profile figures			2
miss @entity5 yesterday said it was legally correct to describe @entity12 ’s crime as ‘ non-violent ’			1
‘ but let me add that , to me , rape is rape , ’ she added			0
‘ it is an appalling crime			0
i was simply reporting the legal facts of this case before commenting			0
’ despite calls for her to be sacked from @entity37 , a spokesman for the programme said : ‘ she will be on the panel next week , so that answers the question			0
’ miss @entity5 , right , appeared on @entity37 with ( @entity131 ) @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 trolling : @entity15 ( left with her mother @entity5 and right ) has been called ' deformed ' and ' half - man , half - horse ' the @entity12 case has been fought over on @entity1 ever since he was convicted in 2012 of raping a 19 - year - old girl in a hotel room in @entity142			1
supporters including his cousin breached the teenager ’s right to anonymity by naming her on @entity1			2
@entity12 ’s cousin and nine others admitted breaking the law and were ordered to pay her £ 6,000 in compensation			2
loyal : @entity12 ' girlfriend of two years , @entity153 , 26 , says she is standing by her man detectives in @entity142 have spoken of the difficulty of tracing @entity1 users who post under made - up names , and admitted that only a fraction of those who abused the girl had faced justice			1
she was forced to adopt a new identity and go into hiding			0
@entity12 still maintains his innocence , and – thanks to support from his loyal girlfriend and her millionaire businessman father – has a slick campaign making the case that he was wrongly convicted			2
her father @entity171 has bankrolled the campaign , which has hired private investigator @entity172 and specialist appeals barrister @entity173 to persuade the @entity174 to re-examine his conviction			0
but @entity12 was refused leave to appeal against his conviction and failed in a challenge to his five - year prison sentence			1
last month @entity179 , a 33 - year - old delivery driver from @entity180 , was jailed for 18 weeks for using @entity1 to threaten to rape @entity182 mp @entity181 in response to her backing of a campaign to put @entity187 on the £ 10 note			1
rape in @entity190 is an offence under the @entity192 , which came into force a decade ago , replacing and refining previous legislation			0
one of the key changes under the new act was to define consent			0
a person consents if they agree to have sex by choice , and if they have the freedom and capacity to make that choice			0
therefore in a situation where a victim had sex when they were incapacitated by drink , the law would say that they did not have the freedom or capacity to make the choice , ie did not consent			0
the law does not require the victim to have physically resisted in order to prove a lack of consent			0

tv presenter reveals his daughter has herself been threatened with rape
@entity7 says he 's ' noted every sick troll ' , adding : ' prosecution awaits '
@entity15 , 27 , his daughter with miss @entity5 , says she 's been targeted
she says : ' to the trolls wishing rape on me stop , you are utterly pathetic '
@entity1 users were outraged after @entity239 appeared on loose women
appeared to defend @entity12 , 25 , saying his rape crime was ' not violent '
@entity12 was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19 - year - old and will be released soon
