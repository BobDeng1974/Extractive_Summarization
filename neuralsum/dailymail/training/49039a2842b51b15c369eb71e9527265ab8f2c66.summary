a pioneer of the cryonics movement which advocates freezing the dead in the hope that medical technology will enable them to live again in the future has died at the age of 92			2
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , became the 106th person to be stored at the @entity11 which he founded in 1976			1
the @entity14 veteran , who taught physics at @entity16 , was seriously wounded during the @entity17 and spent years in hospitals			2
legacy : @entity7 , 92 , has been frozen in the @entity11 he founded after his death high tech : the institute , in @entity9 , @entity24 , already has mr @entity7 's mother and two wives as patients bone graft surgery that saved his legs inspired his optimism about the future prospects of preserving life through technology , a statement from the @entity11 said			1
his son @entity35 said he had been inspired by science fiction writings about deep - freezing the dead and expected researchers to make serious progress toward developing the idea			2
but when nothing seemed to be happening , he wrote a book in 1964 entitled ' @entity42 ' , introducing the concept of cryonics			2
he wrote : ' if civilisation endures , medical science should eventually be able to repair almost any damage to the human body , including freezing damage and senile debility or other cause of death			1
' ' sooner or later our friends of the future should be equal to the task of reviving and curing us , ' said @entity7 optimist : mr @entity7 was inspired by successful bone graft surgery he underwent after being injured during @entity14			1
right , the 1964 book he wrote in which he introduced the idea of freezing humans after death cryonics is the low - temperature preservation of humans and animals with the hope that they will be able to be ' brought back to life ' when science is able to do so			2
it is often confused with cryogenics , the study of the production of very low temperatures and how materials react to them			2
the procedure has to be begun within minutes of cardiac arrest			0
cryoprotectants are used to prevent ice crystals forming between body cells , which would then cause irreparable damage if the victim was then ' thawed '			1
the belief is that memories and identity could survive the freezing process			0
only around 200 people have been preserved cryonically since it was first proposed in 1962			0
films featuring cryonics include @entity92 's @entity91 , @entity94 's @entity93 in 1986 and the 1992 movie @entity95 , starring @entity97 ( pictured )			0
he added : ' no matter what kills us , whether old age or disease , and even if freezing techniques are still crude when we die , sooner or later our friends of the future should be equal to the task of reviving and curing us			0
' mr @entity7 promoted his theory in other writings and appearances on television talk shows			1
the @entity11 has 900 members			0
similar facilities for preserving dead bodies operate in @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			0
he also established the @entity117 , a research and education group devoted to cryonics and extending the human life span			0
the institute charged $ 28,000 to prepare a body and store it long - term in a tank of liquid nitrogen at minus 321 degrees @entity126			1
the first person frozen there was mr @entity7 's mother , @entity127 , who died in 1977			1
both his wives , @entity130 and @entity131 , are also patients at the institute			1
his son said he was never bothered by ridicule and was a ' reluctant prophet '			0
' he did what he thought was necessary and appropriate and did n't worry much about what people thought , ' he said			0
' the people who are scoffers are like the people who said heavier - than - air flight wo n't work			0
' @entity7 died at his home in @entity9 after weeks of declining health .			1
