by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:50 am on 29th november 2011 @entity3 will boycott a vital international conference on the future of @entity6 next month , it emerged today			1
the move is a protest against the @entity10 air - strikes that killed 24 @entity3 soldiers at the weekend in an apparent case of mistaken identity			1
a government official told the @entity16 news agency : ' the cabinet has decided not to attend the @entity19 meeting			0
' @entity3 's attendance at the conference had been considered essential to ensure stability in the region stands a chance			0
it was today claimed that @entity10 forces may have been lured into attacking friendly @entity3 border posts by the @entity44 meanwhile , preliminary @entity37 military reports reveal that @entity10 forces may have been lured into attacking friendly @entity3 border posts in a calculated manoeuvre by the @entity44			1
the attack - which @entity3 claims went on for almost two hours and continued even after soldiers had pleaded with forces to stop - marked the deadliest friendly fire incident with @entity3 since the @entity6 war began			1
a joint @entity37 - @entity6 patrol was attacked by the @entity44 in the early hours of saturday morning			1
while pursuing the @entity44 in the poorly - marked border area , the patrol is said to have mistaken one of the @entity3 troop outposts for a militant encampment and called in a @entity10 gunship and attack helicopters to open fire			1
@entity37 officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , claim the reports suggest the @entity44 may have deliberately tried to provoke a cross-border fire - fight that would set back fragile partnerships between the @entity37 and @entity10 forces and @entity3 soldiers at the ill - defined border			1

before responding , the joint @entity37 - @entity6 patrol first checked with the @entity3 army , which reported it had no troops in the area , the military account said			1
some two hours later , still hunting the insurgents - who had by then apparently fled in the direction of @entity3 border posts - the @entity37 commander spotted what he thought was a militant encampment , with heavy weapons mounted on tripods			2
the joint patrol called for the air - strikes at around 2.21am local time , not realising the encampment was apparently the @entity3 border post			0

at the @entity138 , spokesman @entity137 said president @entity139 considers the @entity3 deaths a tragedy , and said the administration is determined to investigate			2
