by @entity1 reporter @entity2 before the @entity3 became an iconic piece of @entity6 engineering , a 1932 proposal called for the center of the structure to be submerged in the @entity10 allowing ships to safely pass above			1
the ' boat tunnel ' idea , as shown on @entity14 , would 've run right through the center of the bridge and was the brainchild of inventor @entity18			2
according to @entity18 's obituary , he 's imagination ' foresaw the tank , the bazooka , and the moving sidewalk , though he failed to win fame from any of them			0
' the ' boat tunnel ' would allow cars to drive underwater as boats glided easily through the bridge 's center @entity18 's plan was attractive as it was thought to cost just a third of the bridge 's $ 35 million budget , the @entity31 reported			1
plans called for regular truss spans at both ends leading inwards into sections floating on pontoons			0
@entity41 ramps not unlike those found in parking garages would crisscross the interior			0
traveling down one ramp would take a vehicle 45 feet below the waterline , traveling to the other ramp then back to the surface would be via a 1,200 - foot - long tube			0
the design is problematic because of the sudden deceleration needed to enter the ramp areas , which could have led to gridlock			1
today the bridge is a marvel of @entity6 engineering , even if boats travel under it the old fashioned way to protect against the currents , @entity18 advised building a resilient chain barrier to be hung from anchored buoys carrying lights and sound warnings			1
what reason the plan was abandoned is lost to time , and today ships pass the @entity69 by simply steering under it , guided by foghorns .			2

@entity73 proposed *alternate* plan that would have let boats pass above bridge over @entity10
would have cost a third of bridge 's $ *35m* budget
but design would have caused gridlock as cars *slowed* to *descend* under water
