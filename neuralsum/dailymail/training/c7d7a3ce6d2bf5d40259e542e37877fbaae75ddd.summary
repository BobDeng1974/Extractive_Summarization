@entity34 took a tough stance with their @entity37 striker after his gesture following a goal against @entity24 provoked an international outcry			1
although @entity5 has agreed not to repeat the gesture he did not apologise			1
this may be due to the @entity44 investigation which could land him a ban of more than five games , according to new regulations governing race - related offences			2
@entity34 caretaker boss @entity51 admitted the club had been shocked to discover the quenelle gesture was considered anti-semitic by many			1
@entity5 was asked about it by @entity51 after the game at @entity57 and told his manager it had been a dedication for his friend , @entity37 comedian @entity61			2

bittersweet : @entity5 performed the salute after scoring the first of two goals in a 3 - 3 draw with @entity24 the quenelle has already caused problems in the @entity96 , where @entity37 - born basketball star @entity97 , of the @entity98 , was condemned by @entity100 groups after using the salute in a photo with @entity61			1
@entity97 ’s behaviour was ‘ disgusting and dangerous ’ , said rabbi @entity104 , associate dean of the @entity105			2
friends : @entity34 acting head coach @entity51 says that the gesture was a dedication from @entity5 ( right ) to his @entity37 comedian friend @entity61 ( left ) , which @entity5 reiterated on @entity13 doubling up : @entity5 ( left ) is on the spot to score @entity34 's second goal of the afternoon @entity112 the @entity114 defender was pictured twice doing the gesture , once with @entity61 , lastmonth			1

’ @entity61 has convictions for spreading race hate , and last week interior minister @entity138 announced that ‘ all legal means ’ to ban @entity61 from making public appearances were being considered , saying : ‘ he attacks the memory of @entity144 victims in an obvious and unbearable way			0
’ the quenelle — touching a shoulder with one hand , keeping the other arm pointed downwards — is said to be an inverted @entity151 salute			0
@entity61 and his supporters claim it is merely an @entity154 , anti-establishment signal and the 47 - year - old has threatened to sue those suggesting otherwise			0
the gesture has gone viral on social media and two soldiers were sanctioned by the @entity37 army in september for performing it in uniform in front of a @entity165 synagogue			2
@entity5 had also taken to @entity13 on sunday night to insist that his gesture had no religious or anti-semitic connection			1

i do not know what the word religion has to do with this story ! ’ support : @entity175 defender @entity174 tweeted a message to @entity5 after his celebration fooled : @entity114 defender @entity112 ( right ) was pictured making the same gesture as @entity5 but later claimed he was tricked into doing it ‘ the quenelle is a dedication to @entity182			1
with regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations they are the ones who create the confusion and controversy without knowing what the gesture really means ! i shall therefore ask the people not to be duped by the media			0
and of course , i am neither anti-semitic nor racist			0
’ @entity61 applauded @entity5 in a post on his @entity20 page			2

we must be clear about our values			0
’ @entity224 president dr @entity223 wants @entity5 dealt with as if he ‘ had made the infamous outstretched arm salute ’ of the @entity226			0
‘ it is sickening that such a well - known footballer would make such an abusive and hateful gesture in front of tens of thousands of spectators			0
we expect that the @entity234 officials as well as the police will give @entity5 the appropriate punishment			0
’ political protest : a man poses with a drawing showing a @entity100 character covering the mouth of an other character with a gag reading ' freedom of speech ' during a protest in support of @entity61 defiant : a group performs the ' quenelle ' salutes in front of the theatre @entity61 's performing at a lengthy ban for @entity5 may signal the end of his career , with rumours of his retirement already emerging earlier this season			1
