by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 14:21 est , 7 august 2013 @entity1 is married with two children			1
she 's 68 years old , and lists herself as a ' homemaker ' on official forms			0
she 's also the owner of a global company with $ 1.8 billion in revenue annually			1
when billionaire @entity8 died at the age of 92 in 1998 , the financial world speculated about his will , but so secretive was the industrialist that no one found out who owned his billion - dollar company , @entity14 , until years later			1
it was n't until 2002 , when his grandson @entity16 took his aunt , @entity8 's daughter @entity1 , to probate court , that the world discovered how @entity16 had divided up his fortune			1
secretly successful : the only photo of enigmatic @entity1 ( pictured with husband @entity23 ) that seems to exists online in a recent @entity26 profile , it was revealed that in 1986 , @entity8 set up a trust for his daughter @entity1 that contained the vast majority of the assets in his estate			1
she would be the only recipient of income from the trust 's assets , and 21 years after @entity16 's death , @entity1 would inherit the entire trust			2
the trustees could , at their discretion , hand the trust over to @entity1 at an earlier date			2
awaiting billions ? @entity1 's son @entity43 ( left ) with his wife			2
@entity43 works for the family company @entity14 , which produces pipe fittings and tubing and other fixtures			1
it also produces billions for the @entity1 family the good life : @entity1 and his wife could be the next beneficiaries of the family billions now that his mercurial mom @entity55 has been given an estimated $ 1.7 billion by a trust set up by her secretive father none of his nine grandchildren were recognized in the will or given any role in the company that made @entity16 's fortune , @entity14 , which makes plumbing products such as fittings , valves and hoses			1
there was one further stipulation : if @entity1 died before she assumed ownership of the trust , @entity16 's grandchildren would inherit what assets remained in the trust			1
founder : @entity8 established his company in 1947 and grew it from nothing into a billion - dollar empire before his death in 1998 it was this condition that prompted @entity16 , one of @entity8 's snubbed grandchildren , to bring a case against his aunt attempting to dismantle the trust in 2002			1
the case was directed at the trustees of his grandfather 's assets , whom he accused of mismanagement			0
however , @entity16 's right to bring the case to court was questioned by the @entity1 's lawyer			2
according to @entity26 , @entity98 wrote a motion to dismiss the case due to @entity16 's lack of standing			0
' if @entity1 survives the 21 years , @entity103 receives nothing			2
if the entire trust is distributed to @entity1 in the trustee ’s discretion , @entity103 receives nothing			2
if @entity1 does not survive the 21 years , and @entity103 does not survive the 21 years , @entity103 receives nothing [ … ] ' the judge at the @entity112 probate court dismissed @entity16 's case			0
however , in 2003 , @entity1 agreed to pay pay each of @entity8 ’s grandchildren , @entity16 included , $ 1.25 million			0
each of his great grandchildren ( including any unborn ) would receive $ 15,000			0
@entity1 , or @entity118 as she is also known , lives by her father 's mantra			0
' she made the settlement with her nephew to avoid further litigation on his part , according to @entity26			0
however , she need n't have bothered bending to her nephew 's willl ; that same year , the trustees decided to hand over all the assets to @entity134 well ahead of schedule , making her an instant billionaire			0
billion dollar digs ? a satellite view shows the densely wooded @entity139 , @entity140 neighborhood that reclusive bilionaire heiress @entity1 is believed to call home unassuming : the 68 - year - old assumed billionaire wo n't go public with her rumored inheritance			1
nor does she live in an ostentatious town			0
pictured is @entity139 , @entity140 , where @entity1 lives @entity14 : the company that made the family its billions makes simple necessities like valves , piping , tubes , and other plumbing equipment			1
at right , the company headquarters in @entity156 , @entity140 extended stay ? the younger @entity1 , @entity43 ( at right with wife @entity158 ) works at @entity14 's @entity160 location @entity26 experts estimate @entity134 's fortune at $ 1.7 billion , but the billionaire has no interest in confirming or denying that figure			1
a @entity26 reporter inquiring as to whether their estimate was accurate was given short shrift by a staffer at the @entity171 and @entity172 , the charitable trust run by @entity1 and her husband , who once worked for @entity8			0
the reporter was told that @entity175 was out of town and that even if she were n't , she would n't care to comment on her fortune			0
