@entity0 , 39 , lost his job in 2011 after his wife claimed he had subjected her to a long campaign of violence which began in 1999 when she was pregnant			1
she told police he was a ' controlling individual ' who became obsessed with the idea she was having an affair			0
but after his conviction - for which he got 180 hours unpaid work - police arrested @entity0 again and accused him of raping two women , allegedly telling one he was a police officer who ' could find and kill her '			1
@entity0 , a father - of - three from @entity23 , @entity24 , faced two trials accused of 14 charges of rape , three of sexual assault and another charge of perverting justice			1
but a judge at @entity32 threw out the case earlier this month following legal submissions			1
@entity0 - who was once one of the youngest @entity36 police inspectors in @entity37 - has now vowed to take legal action against @entity39 and the @entity40 claiming he had been a victim of ' jealousy ' in the force due to his ' meteoric ' rise through the ranks			1
he said he may need counselling after the stress of his trial and added : ' i do not think it should have ever had to come to this and i am going to commence proceedings arising from this court case in terms of the way it was investigated			0
' institutional racism exists profoundly within the police service			1
whatever sense of justice i thought there was in @entity39 does not exist			0
i also rose through the ranks very quickly and there may have been people that were jealous			0
' he told local paper , the @entity66 that whilst awaiting trial he had spent time in prison and added : ' i had to notify the prison staff i was an ex-police officer as i might have come into contact with people i arrested			0
' but the prisoners very quickly found out			0
i was kept behind closed doors 23 - hours a day for protection			0
' after joining the police , @entity0 - a former school governor - was quickly promoted to inspector to oversee neighbourhood policing and was well - known locally			1
he had helped introduce reforms in the constabulary and his performance in police exams was said to among the best in the country			0
@entity0 was cleared of rape and sexual assault at @entity32 ( pictured ) and now claims police failed to fully investigate the claims made against him but his downfall began in 2010 when wife went to police to report a series of incidents			1
he was later convicted of assault after a court heard he attacked her and pulled her hair before her driving theory test and then threw furniture across a room			2
at the time , a then - 33 - year - old @entity0 said he was not old enough to cope with his rapid promotion to his Â£ 50,000 - a - year post and claimed it brought about a ' wholesale change in his character '			1
the original list of charges alleged a decade of violence , but @entity0 admitted the common assaults in relation to two incidents and other charges were dropped			1
after @entity0 completed community service , he was was detained again on his return from a pilgrimage in @entity117 after two women came forward to say he had sexually assaulted them			2
a trial opened last year but had to be abandoned due to legal problems			0
a second trial judge then decided not guilty verdicts should be entered after a week of submissions			0
he says other officers were jealous of his quick rise through the force and the sex charges should never have been brought against him @entity0 's lawyer @entity129 , partner at @entity130 , said ' this has been a challenging and worrying case and my client had completely denied all charges from the first moment , and ultimately has been vindicated			1
' explaining the case , a @entity40 spokesman said : ' after receiving medical evidence relating to the complainant in this case the prosecution applied to the judge to have the evidence given by the complainant in an earlier trial adduced as hearsay evidence in this trial			2
' after hearing legal argument from prosecution and defence about this issue the judge refused the application and the @entity40 decided that in these circumstances it would not be appropriate to require the complainant to give evidence			0
' we concluded that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction against any of the defendants and therefore offered no evidence at court			0
' we take all cases of alleged sexual offences extremely seriously , however the health and welfare of alleged victims remains one of our prime considerations			2
' a spokesperson for @entity24 police said : ' while disappointed with the outcome we of course respect the decision of the court which we recognise has been taken in the best interests of justice and of the alleged victims			2
' @entity39 remains committed to investigating allegations of sexual offences , no matter how historic , and no matter what the role , position and status of the alleged offender , and we would encourage anyone who has been a victim to come forward safe in the knowledge that they will be treated sensitively and professionally			2
