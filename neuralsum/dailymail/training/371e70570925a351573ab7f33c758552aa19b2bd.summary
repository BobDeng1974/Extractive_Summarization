' @entity0 ' : @entity2 real - estate tycoon @entity1 was ridiculed for blaming yesterday 's massacre of journalists on @entity6 's gun - control laws @entity1 has been labelled a moron on @entity8 for suggesting the victims of the @entity11 massacre were denied ' a fighting chance ' by @entity6 's gun laws			1
in a series of tweets , the generously coiffed real - estate tycoon suggested the gunmen were only able to murder with impunity because there were no armed bystanders to shoot back			1
@entity8 users ' responses were mixed , but generally negative			0
the first reply , by @entity24 from @entity25 , @entity26 , said : ' [ @entity28 ] hat a complete idiot			0
more people would have f * * * ing died ! ! ! @entity32 of crossfire ! ! ! ' @entity1 's tweets , posted less than 12 hours after news broke of the slaughter in the @entity11 newsroom , said : ' if the people so violently shot down in @entity39 had guns , at least they would have had a fighting chance			2
' is n't it interesting that the tragedy in @entity39 took place in one of the toughest gun control countries in the world ? ' remember , when guns are outlawed , only outlaws will have guns ! ' by this morning , @entity1 had been labelled a moron in 38 of the replies to his first tweet alone , while a further 44 responses to that same tweet had labelled him stupid			1
about another 80 responses mentioned the word ' idiot ' , although not all were directly critical of @entity1			0
however , @entity1 's pronouncement was chosen as a ' favourite ' by 933 people and retweeted 1,488 times , and many - though by no means the majority - of responses were supportive of his view			0
responding to @entity1 , @entity66 , from @entity67 , wrote on @entity8 : ' [ @entity68 ] ive everyone guns - how can @entity2 murder scenes be wrong ? ' @entity73 @entity72 from @entity74 , @entity75 , wrote : ' [ @entity76 ] one of them would have had a shot ! none ! 2 guys with @entity80 surprised a room			1
guns would have done nothing ! ' @entity84 , from @entity85 , told @entity1 : ' just like the guys in the @entity87 hey @entity1 ? ' another user who identified herself only as @entity89 replied to the tycoon : ' they were journalists			1
not stupid @entity93 red @entity94			0
@entity95 boil your wig '			0
trumps tweets : by this morning , @entity1 had been labelled a moron in 38 of the replies to his first of the three tweets alone , while a further 44 responses to that same tweet had labelled him stupid moreover , gun laws in @entity6 are not so restrictive as @entity1 seems to believe			1
possession of automatic firearms is banned across the @entity107 , except in special circumstances			0
but that law is similar in the @entity2 , where citizens must have permission from the @entity112 to possess fully automatic weapons			1
in @entity6 citizens must have a licence to buy a weapon , but once one is obtained they can use it to buy handguns and even semi-automatic rifles - the kind where all you have to do is pull the trigger to fire			2
both such weapons are banned in the mainland @entity125			0
' @entity126 ' : journalists hold placards reading ' i am @entity126 ' as they hold a minute of silence at the offices of news agency @entity132 in @entity39 despite the law , @entity6 has long had a problem with organised criminal gangs with access @entity137 assault rifles , said @entity139 of the @entity140			1
' there was also a spate in @entity6 of criminals using rocket - propelled grenades for robberies and even prison breaks , ' mr @entity139 told @entity147			2
he said @entity6 criminals ' relative ease of access to automatic weapons raised an important question about the circumstances of yesterday 's massacre in @entity39 , where the gunmen fired in single shots throughout			1
' if they did have fully - automatic kalashnikovs and they opted to use single shots that suggests a degree of military training , because as you use the fully automatic fire accuracy goes down			0
' an injured person is carried into an ambulance after the massacre at the offices of @entity6 satirical newspaper @entity11 in @entity39			2
those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in @entity6 high security : a @entity6 soldier patrols in front of the @entity172 after the attack yesterday seven people have been arrested over the @entity11 massacre , but two ' armed and dangerous ' brothers with links to terrorist groups going back at least a decade today remained on the run			1
as the manhunt for @entity182 and @entity183 continued , their alleged getaway driver @entity180 , 18 , turned himself into police in @entity185 in northern @entity6			2
the fact that two were still at large almost 24 hours after a gun battle in which two policemen died alongside ten others , mainly magazine staff , was also a cause for huge concern			0
@entity6 is today holding a day of mourning for the 12 people killed during the country 's worst terrorist atrocity this century			2
a minute 's silence will be observed at midday across the country and the bells of @entity200 in the capital will toll .			0

@entity2 tycoon labelled a moron 38 times in response to a single tweet
he suggested that if journalists had guns they could have fought back
he seems to have been *misinformed* about *prevalence* of guns in @entity6
