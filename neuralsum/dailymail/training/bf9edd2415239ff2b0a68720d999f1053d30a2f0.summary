but when 58 - year - old @entity5 was doing the washing up she noticed colourful patterns in the bubbles and decided to turn it into art. mrs @entity5 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , has been a keen photographer for many years but never realised she could find the perfect picture as part of her daily routine			1
@entity5 noticed colourful patterns in soapy dishwater as she did the washing up the images were created using a macro lens , a remote control shutter and an angle poise lamp instead of flash such a chore : @entity5 noticed the beautiful patterns in the soapy water when she was doing the dishes mrs @entity5 said : ' i leaned in very closely and saw that there were tiny patterns swirling about so rushed off to find my camera and try some experiments			1
' i 'm a very keen photographer always looking for unusual subjects			0
there are none more so than the strange and fantastic patterns in soap - the flat film in a child 's ' bubble wand ' before it is blown into bubbles			1
just a few millimetres at a time are photographed by @entity5 in order to create the stunning images blu tack , children 's bubble mixture , a bubble wand and an angle poise lamp were used to set up each photograph true colours : different soaps create different effects depending on their thickness ' the liquid swirls around and colourful shapes can be seen and will amaze you if you look very closely			1
' i like to photograph them with my @entity60 camera and @entity62 macro lens			0
i do n't use flash , just a small office angle - poise lamp , and i use a remote control shutter release cable in my left hand while i focus with the right			0
' technically speaking , the patterns arise naturally from the interference of reflected light rays from the front and rear surface of a thin film of soapy water in the tiny frame or ' bubble wand '			2
forever blowing bubbles : the effects occur naturally from the interference of reflected light from the film of soapy water soaps of varying levels of thickness were used by @entity5 to create different effects former teacher @entity5 says she is a keen photographer and she looks for ' unusual ' subjects ' the inner circle which i use for most of these photos measures approx 18mm			1
most of the shots are of very tiny areas - just a few millimetres - within that ring			0
' it 's almost impossible to photograph the whole area because only small parts are in focus at any one time			2
' i have since experimented with lots of soaps , especially the commercially available ' bubble mixture ' that comes in little pots for children but also shampoos and different washing up liquids			2
' the thicker the better because the patterns last longer			0
' wave of colour : no flash was used to produce the images of the soapy effects photographer @entity5 creates the art from her home in @entity11 , @entity12 , where she lives with her husband @entity116 home made : @entity5 created the swirling images using soap and a bubble wand at her home in @entity122			1

@entity5 , 58 , noticed patterns when doing the dishes
she used children 's ' bubble wands ' to *recreate* effects and photograph them
