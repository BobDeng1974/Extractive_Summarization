@entity0 today hit out at the ' complete idiot ' tv pundit who claimed @entity3 was ' totally @entity4 ' and ' non-muslims just simply do n't go in ' , @entity6 made the bizarre comments on @entity8 in the @entity9 - also claiming there were religious police squads roaming the streets of @entity13 who ' seriously wound ' people in @entity17 dress			1
it sparked bafflement on @entity20 under the hashtag # @entity21 , with users suggesting his theory was about as likely as @entity25 tv presenter @entity25 being a radical cleric			1
mr @entity0 said he thought it must be @entity27 , adding : ‘ when i heard this , frankly i choked on my porridge			0
this guy is clearly a complete idiot			0
' he added : ‘ now , he started with an apology – that ’s not a bad place to start			0
but what he should do is actually look at @entity3 and see what a fantastic example it is of bringing people together of different faiths and different backgrounds and actually building a world class brilliant city			2
he has now pledged a donation to the city 's children 's hospital @entity0 said when he heard the comments he ' thought it must be @entity52 ' , adding : ' i choked on my porridge ' in reality , 22 per cent of people from @entity3 are @entity4 , according to the 2011 census , fewer than half of the 46 per cent who regard themselves as @entity61			1
@entity3 is the area with the ninth - highest @entity4 population in @entity63 , beaten by four @entity13 boroughs alongside @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			2
mr @entity6 has now apologised to @entity3 's 1.1million people , insisting the city is ' beautiful ' and pledging a donation to the @entity72			1
but he stopped short of offering any sort of apology directly to the city 's @entity75 , who he appeared to lump into the same category as extremists in his rant			1
the ' expert ' has run a group called the @entity84 for 20 years and written books with titles such as ' @entity87 ' and ' @entity88 '			0
critics have accused him of inaccuracies and encouraging @entity91 , yet he is still called upon regularly by news networks and congressional committees in the @entity9 pundit : mr @entity6 ( right ) made the claim in an interview with @entity8			1
he has run a ' project on terrorism ' for 20 years and is regularly called on by news outlets , though his critics accuse him of inaccuracies slight : in fact , @entity3 has twice as many @entity61 ( 46 per cent ) as @entity75 ( 22 per cent )			1
mr @entity6 stopped short of apologising to the city 's @entity105 population , who he appeared to lump in with extremists his blunder came in a wide - ranging @entity8 interview about how to react to the @entity112 attacks in @entity113			1
' in @entity63 , it 's not just no - go zones , ' he claimed			2
' there are actual cities like @entity3 that are totally @entity4 where non-muslims just simply do n't go in			1
' as the interviewer 's eyes widened in surprise , he added : ' and parts of @entity13 , there are actually @entity4 religious police that actually beat and actually wound seriously anyone who does n't dress according to @entity4 , religious @entity4 attire			1
' mr @entity6 initially seemed happy with the factual accuracy of his performance , posting the entire interview on his website			2
but once told of his fairly significant error , he apologised			0
' i have clearly made a terrible error for which i am deeply sorry , ' he told @entity135			0
@entity136 : in time - honoured fashion , an ironic hashtag about the gaffe was soon circulating on twitter ' my comments about @entity3 were totally in error , and i am issuing an apology and correction on my website immediately for having made this comment about the beautiful city of @entity3			1
' i do not intend to justify or mitigate my mistake by stating that i had relied on other sources because i should have been much more careful			0
' i intend to make a donation to a @entity3 charity called the @entity72			2
' thousands of @entity20 users were suggesting alternative ' @entity8 facts ' - with a similar level of factual accuracy - within hours of the gaffe			1
one suggested @entity158 had dispensed with cars and was now known as @entity160 , while another said all the walls in @entity163 were made from corn			0
jokes : commenters on @entity20 said the theory was about as likely as tv presenter @entity25 being a radical cleric , or @entity169 bingo halls being a substitute for the holy city of pilgrimage because @entity3 was ' totally @entity4 ' it would have to remove ' ham ' from its name , suggested other users			1
factual accuracy aside , many defended the city against what they took to be a crude islamophobic attack			0

and school deputy head teacher wrote : ' i live in a multicultural city			0
i work in a multicultural school			0
@entity3 is vibrant because it is diverse			0

@entity8 really are beyond a joke ! ' .			2
