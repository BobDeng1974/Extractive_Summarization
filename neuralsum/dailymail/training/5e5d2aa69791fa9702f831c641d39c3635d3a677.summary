your perspective on the immediate situation at @entity3 probably revolves around how you view sleight of hand and misdirection in magic tricks like find the lady , three - card - monte or the shell - game			1
it takes great confidence and skill from those who shuffle cards around to hide where the @entity14 is , or to whizz the cups about so that the one with the shell under it is undetectable			2
‘ @entity21 ’ could n’t exist without it			2
however , it ’s usually just a con — aimed at robbing you of , at least , your attention , probably your common sense and , at worst , all your cash			0
@entity28 ( left ) looks to advance past @entity31 's @entity30 defender @entity29 on thursday night @entity28 scores from the penalty spot at the @entity33 during the @entity35 last - 16 match against @entity31 @entity28 celebrates after scoring @entity3 's third goal against @entity31 at the @entity33 on thursday night thus it is that all attention is centred on the farcical did he / did n’t he ? mini-drama concocted by a @entity42 television station when they announced that @entity3 ’s greatest - ever footballer @entity28 demanded the removal of current coach @entity45			1
by late on friday night , @entity42 journalists were running around in a frenzy			0
the rumours ranged from @entity49 , @entity28 staging some sort of putsch for power — to a decision for him to move to @entity54 already being taken			1
all of which has served to neatly divert eyes away from the fact that this is very nearly the situation which the football vandalism of the @entity60 era has been on target to create from the outset			0
in case his name has slipped your mind , @entity60 is the man who has always wanted to reinvent the wheel			0
a vice-president when @entity69 came to power in a footballing renaissance fuelled by @entity73 - ist philosophy back in 2003 , @entity60 always detested the @entity75 ’s manner , legacy and influence at the @entity33			0
smack bang in the middle of @entity3 ’s @entity81 vision and painstaking construction , @entity60 walked away from the club in 2005 , contending that everyone was out of step except for him			1
he wanted big , athletic , preferably @entity88 footballers — he wanted physical power and powerful spending			0
@entity3 were producing intelligent , balletic , technical geniuses like @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity28 while scouting , training and developing to a @entity73 / @entity98 / @entity97 template			1
former @entity3 president @entity60 is the man who has always wanted to reinvent the wheel @entity3 's ex-manager @entity100 ( right ) shakes hands with then - @entity3 president @entity60 it yielded football which has taken its place in the all - time pantheon of excellence in this sport			1
@entity69 ’s personal hedonism left a vacuum at the end of his final mandate into which @entity60 stepped — winning a landslide presidential victory			0
but , from 2010 onwards , there has been a steady drive towards this point when , having been nearly unstoppable as recently as the middle of 2012 , @entity3 are now unravelling dramatically			1
under @entity60 ’s direction , a director of football @entity118 was appointed who has singularly failed to guide the club to an appropriate coaching appointment following the illness and death of @entity126 , who repeatedly failed to re-stock @entity3 ’s back four or midfield and who was a party to the rule breaking which has caused @entity131 to ban the club from two transfer markets			1
from the beginning of his regime , i predicted @entity60 would dedicate himself to finding ‘ his ’ @entity28 — an iconic footballer who would , in theory , give @entity60 his place in the history books and allow @entity3 to edge the @entity140 towards a vastly lucrative transfer to fund the vanity project of a new stadium			1
@entity145 is probably the guy who is now closest to @entity28 in the squad			1
however the at - any - cost pursuit of the @entity88 did two key things			0
firstly , @entity3 ’s board became blind to the obvious need to reinvigorate the first - team squad with the kind of power , height and pace lost via the departures of @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160			1
secondly , given the club ’s vomit of half - truths , the process via which @entity60 dashed @entity167 ’s equally determined pursuit of @entity145 cost him all credibility and also his position at the club			0
throughout @entity28 ’s emergence as a true genius of football , @entity3 had repeatedly chosen to cosset and reassure him			1
' @entity28 drives @entity3 to despair ' ran the headline on the front of @entity177 after he followed @entity54 on @entity178 ' @entity3 fall apart ' ran the headline on tuesday 's edition of @entity181 after @entity28 failed to attend training @entity183 devoted plenty of pages to dissecting the growing crisis at the @entity33 @entity187 , now in charge at @entity189 , was part of a strategy , formed with fellow vice-president @entity192 and director of football @entity193 nearly 10 years ago now , to ensure that the player ’s contract would be spruced up every 12 - 14 months			1
the idea was firstly to ensure the @entity28 entourage would keep @entity3 abreast of which club was sniffing about this or that year			1
secondly , it emerged that improving his terms and his ‘ sense of wellbeing ’ regularly began to be wholly in step with the improvement in his performances , worth , and importance to the club ’s trophy winning			0
@entity60 ’s era became so different that his finance director felt free to moan publicly about having to increase @entity28 ’s salary so regularly			1
why on earth break a successful formula ? why make sentiments like that public ? but here is the key thing which the recent media misdirection has helped keep in the background			0
@entity3 were a repeat - @entity223 winning franchise with an almost perfect playbook — and @entity60 burned the formula			2
he launched an offensive against @entity73 so malignant that the club icon handed back his entitlement to be honorary president and has n’t been to the @entity33 since			0
@entity54 boss @entity230 has previously played down speculation linking his side with a move for @entity28 @entity28 fuelled speculation he could be keen on a move to @entity54 by following the club 's @entity178 account here 's what @entity28 would look like if he was to seal a move to the @entity242 's west @entity241 outfit the @entity73 ideology becoming verboten inevitably coincided with @entity244 beginning to feel a cold and distant relationship with president @entity60			1
it all caused @entity3 to prematurely lose a tired , burned - out coach in whose hands lay the right way to progress and renew this era			2
the abandonment of the ideals which had guided and created almost unparalleled footballing excellence gradually led to an erosion of the kind of daily intensity , hard - nosed competitiveness and crystal - clear philosophy of positional play upon which this squad depended			0
so , admittedly , it is a legitimate news line to pursue whether @entity28 did or did n’t demand the removal of @entity45			1
but it is n’t the real issue			0
the central problems include the fact that @entity60 , who quit in disgrace , is n’t around to take the criticism for the horrendous botch he made of what he inherited			0
the next key issue is that , while no player can be allowed to hold a club hostage and dictate their decision - making , @entity28 is wholly within his rights if he a ) chooses to express his unhappiness and b ) finally opts that he wants to leave			2
@entity28 started @entity3 's defeat against @entity280 on the bench before coming on in the second half @entity3 manager @entity45 future at the @entity42 club is in doubt after a fall - out with senior players @entity3 president @entity288 is reportedly already looking at candidates to replace @entity45 @entity290 beat @entity28 's @entity3 on sunday night it was as if @entity290 had borrowed some of the magic of the @entity293 on sunday as @entity280 became giant - killers and took the scalp of @entity3			1
click here for the full report aged 27 , it is feasible that the best is yet to come for him			0
some will tell you that his best is in the past but such opinions are based on the performances of a genius in a declining team and at a club which has been turning wine into water			0
if @entity45 , who faces @entity311 champions @entity310 at the @entity33 on sunday night , is going to get things right then it will be a dramatic turnaround			2
he ’s given few signs thus far			0
irrespective of how many years of his contract he has left , @entity28 could justifiably demand a summit with the incumbent president and assess the direction in which the club is headed			2
to assess whether presidential elections in the summer might put @entity3 back on course			2
right now , i ’m guided , his intention is to catalyse positive changes and stay			0
but leaving has never been so high on his agenda			0
the financial behemoth of obtaining @entity28 ’s registration via a forced buy - out , using the € 250million recision clause and paying the € 100m + @entity331 , is unimaginable under current football regulations			2
thus , should @entity28 feel that he needs to leave then he ’ll have to demand a transfer			2
if he were to do that what would it tell you about his club ? the club to which he owes a lifelong debt , the club via which he has become an all - time great , the club where he has been immensely happy and settled ? precisely what the player did or did n’t say to a president whose days are numbered about a coach who is not up to the task is of less overall significance than how and why the perfect marriage of @entity3 , scintillating football and @entity28 is on course to end in the divorce courts			1
@entity3 's main player @entity28 has been linked with a move to @entity242 club @entity54 in recent weeks			1

@entity28 has been linked with a move from @entity3 to @entity54
the @entity3 and @entity358 star followed @entity54 on @entity178
there have been reports @entity28 told @entity3 to get rid of @entity45
