paedophile : @entity1 , 21 , was sentenced to prison after a court found that she had slept with a child 50 times a female paedophile has been jailed for having sex with an eight - year - old boy more than fifty times			1
@entity1 , 21 , was 16 when she first slept with the schoolboy , who can not be identified , and continued until he was ten years old			1
@entity1 , who has a child of her own , would have regular intercourse with the boy , now 14 , and was only found out after he was overheard bragging about it at school			1
a judge today gave @entity1 a two - year prison sentence at @entity19 , following a trial last month where she was convicted of three counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 16			1
she could be seen smiling and smoking outside the court today as she awaited her sentence			1
the judge in the case told @entity1 that he would be lenient with the sentence - which will see her released from jail after one year - because she ' realised it was wrong ' and stopped having sex with the boy			1
@entity34 police said they started investigating @entity1 in march last year after the boy 's school told them that he had been heard bragging about having sex with her			1
judge @entity39 said : ' i make no secret of the fact your case has given me cause for much consideration			0
' i have come to the conclusion that due to the concern and embarrassment caused to both you and your family that you will not be offending again , let alone committing sexual offences			2
' i am also aware of the effect this will have on your baby			0
i am pleased to hear your parents have started to build bridges with you			2
' that does not stop the fact though that you had full sexual intercourse with a child when he was eight to 10 years old - by his evidence it was upwards of fifty times			1
' it seems to me that i am bound to pass an immediate custodial sentence			0
i take into account what has been said to me and the fact that you stopped the activity yourself			0
' you realised it was wrong rather than being caught and forced to stop			0
therefore my sentence is one of two years			2
you will serve 12 months in prison before being released on licence			0
' repeated : the court heard that @entity1 slept with the boy , who can not be named , more than 50 times defence lawyer @entity84 had told the court @entity1 was struggling to accept the facts of the case , and asked judge @entity88 to spare her a prison sentence altogether			1
he said : ' her immaturity at 21 means she can not accept the facts yet			0
she accepts her conviction but with time will accept more			0
' her parents have stepped in and are building bridges , i understand she has met with some of her family			0
' this could be stifled by a custodial sentence so i urge your honour or try and suspend it if possible			0
' @entity1 , from @entity104 , will serve two years each for the three counts to be served concurrently			1
her sentence included a @entity108 , banning her from contact with a child under 16 without permission of a parent			2
she was also ordered to sign the @entity113 , where her details will remain for ten years .			2
