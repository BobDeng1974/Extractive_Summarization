by @entity0 last updated at 11:07 am on 2nd january 2012 @entity1 was said to be furious at being fined £ 250,000 and dropped from @entity4 's @entity3 match after being ' lethargic ' at training			1
the 26 - year - old striker apparently incurred sir @entity8 's wrath by going out for a @entity10 dinner with wife @entity11 and then arriving for training looking worse for wear			1
he was described as ' bemused and upset ' at his treatment by the 70 - year - old manager over the past week			2
sitting it out : @entity1 watched from a corporate box at @entity17 as his team - mates slipped up against lowly @entity20 on saturday wayward star : @entity22 drives @entity1 away from training yesterday after his run - in with boss sir @entity8 @entity1 and @entity11 were joined by team - mates @entity25 and @entity27 and their partners in a celebration of @entity4 ’s 5 - 0 win over @entity31 on @entity10			1
good life : the @entity4 star with wife @entity11 on holiday in @entity35 earlier this year the @entity4 and @entity37 star and @entity38 is missing through injury - were said to have been in a bad state at training the day after			1
@entity8 was infuriated at their behaviour , sources said , because he had warned them to rest and ' not be seen out and about '			1
although it was suggested that the players had only been for dinner , insiders said @entity8 would not discipline players just for going out five days before their next game			1
it was apparently the unacceptably poor physical condition of the players at training that so angered their manager			1
@entity1 was said to think he had been treated unfairly			0
the father - of - one was apparently horrified at @entity8 's ' complete over-reaction			1
' @entity1 was reportedly summoned to his boss 's office for a telling - off , and the players were given one of @entity8 's famous ' hair - dryer ' rants after apparently discussing what a good night they had had			1
he was forced to watch his team 's @entity3 humiliation against @entity20 - a 3 - 2 defeat - from a corporate box at @entity17			2
the players were initially ordered to do extra training on wednesday , which had been supposed to be a day off			2
then , on friday night , @entity1 was informed he and @entity25 would be dropped for the game against @entity20 , and that he had been hit with the huge financial penalty			0
glam : @entity1 and @entity11 will need to keep a low profile after their ill - advised night out on @entity10 the confrontation between sir @entity8 and @entity1 has its roots in an earlier upheaval			1
in october 2010 , @entity1 publicly alleged that @entity4 were not serious about winning trophies and suggested that they did not share his own ambitions			0
the striker hinted that he wanted to leave the club , with many believing he was about to be lured by the offer of a bumper contract from big - spending @entity86			2
but @entity8 took to the airwaves to voice his disappointment - not anger - at @entity1 's apparent desire to leave			1
speaking to a group of journalists , he affected shock : ' i could n't understand it at all			0
he said he was at the biggest club in the world and he wanted to stay for life			2
' he added : ' this is a club which bases all its history and its tradition on the loyalty and trust between managers and players and the club			0
that goes back to the days of sir @entity108 's what it 's founded on			2
' he wanted to go			0
i said to him , " just remember one thing : respect this club			0
i do n't want any nonsense from you , respect your club "			0
' the upshot was @entity1 stayed - with an improved contract - and @entity8 reserved his ire for agent @entity121 , who he blamed for turning @entity1 's head			1
but it seems the rift may not have healed completely			0
yesterday afternoon , @entity1 told his followers on @entity126 : ' my resolution - to start the year as a champion , and finish it as a champion ... ' sources insisted @entity8 's strict punishment of @entity1 will not have a long - term impact on the working relationship between the manager and a player @entity4 can not afford to do without			1
@entity1 is expected to take his place in the team at @entity139 this wednesday night			2
but the episode is a serious lapse at a time when the striker is needed to lead a team struggling under the weight of injury , illness and poor form			2
@entity1 and the @entity4 manager have been involved in previous major bust - ups			0
now , speculation is growing that the latest row could put the player 's future at the club in jeopardy			0
@entity1 and @entity8 ’s relationship looked beyond repair 14 months ago after the @entity160 star told his boss he no longer wanted to play for @entity4			1
@entity1 released a statement , saying his decision was based on ambition and it seemed certain he would leave @entity17			0
but within days , @entity1 had made a dramatic u-turn and agreed to a contract extension that tied him to the club until 2015			0
the club has not yet responded to questions about this week 's argument			0
@entity171 , centre , looks miserable as @entity4 crash to a shock defeat against @entity20			0

striker apparently went out for meal with wife @entity11 and two team - mates
he was ' lethargic ' at training the next day
