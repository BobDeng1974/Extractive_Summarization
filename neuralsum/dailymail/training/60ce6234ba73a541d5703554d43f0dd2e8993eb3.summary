@entity1 military has called off the search for a ' @entity4 underwater vessel ' thought to have been lurking in the @entity6 archipelago , after admitting that it was ' definitely not ' a submarine			1
@entity9 top brass has today been forced to concede that although ' underwater activity ' is confirmed , the military has ruled out the possibility that it could have been a @entity4 sub			1
this comes after @entity14 blasted the hunt as ' groundless actions by the @entity1 military , based on a @entity18 - rhetoric '			1
no @entity4 winter : a @entity1 minesweeper and a guard boat in @entity22 , as the military calls off the search for a suspected @entity4 submarine in the @entity25 the week - long hunt has involved more than 200 troops , stealth ships and helicopters which have been scouring the waters off @entity6 since last friday			1
the @entity1 military 's search for a ' foreign underwater activity ' in the @entity25 has been the country 's biggest military mobilisation since the @entity18			2
at a press conference this morning , the military confirmed that there had been some form of underwater activity , but that a submarine has been ruled out as the water where the activity took place is too shallow			1
the military has not been able to prove ‘ type of vessel , nationality or activity , ’ rear admiral @entity45 said			0
' there has been a suspected underwater action which is completely unacceptable			0
' calling it off : rear admiral @entity45 , pictured earlier this week , said today that the military has been able to confirm underwater activity but that it was definitely not a submarine protecting borders : more than 200 troops , stealth ships and helicopters which have been scouring the waters off @entity6 since last friday in search for the ' @entity4 submarine ' rear admiral @entity45 added : ' it is our conclusion that remaining in the archipelago would not give us more information			1

' the vessels were unidentified , but during the 1980s the @entity1 navy from time to time hunted suspected @entity119 submarines in its waters the incident heightened tensions in a region where governments are increasingly worried about @entity4 assertiveness since the @entity127 crisis			0
