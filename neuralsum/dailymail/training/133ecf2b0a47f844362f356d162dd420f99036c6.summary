by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 04:14 est , 18 september 2013 the ancient fossil of a 40 million - year - old ‘ walking whale ’ has been unearthed by @entity4 palaeontologists			0
the fossil , which has legs that resemble its land - based ancestors , could provide a link between how today ’s sea mammals evolved from amphibious to aquatic creatures			1
the discovery was made in the vast @entity12 in southern @entity4 - an area famous for being a treasure trove of ancient marine discovery			0
‘ we already knew about the paleontological richness of @entity25 dating back 10 - 12 million years , ’ palaeontologist @entity21 told @entity22			0
‘ now we can say that the most important primitive sea mammal deposit in @entity20 is at @entity25			1
’ up until now , evidence of ancient sea mammals such as this had only been found in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
this artist 's impressions shows what the ancient animal , which belongs to a group called @entity38 , may have looked like the 40 million - year - old fossil in @entity4 , belongs to a group called @entity38			0
these are ancient sea mammals that still show some of the characteristics of their land - based ancestors			1
in the past 30 years , fossil finds have shed light on the sequence of evolutionary transformations			1
it is thought that the first whale ancestor was a furry , four - legged omnivore that evolved into a range of amphibious species 50 million years ago			2
over time , whales lost the connection between their backbone and hind legs , then gradually lost the hind legs completely			1
whales are thought to have evolved into fully aquatic species around 45 million years ago			2
the whale belongs to a group called @entity38 , which are ancient sea mammals that still show some of the characteristics of their terrestrial ancestors			2
@entity68 finds over the past 30 years have shown how a sequence of evolutionary transformations , between 52 and 40 million years ago , led to today ’s whales living in the oceans rather than on land			1
the first whale ancestor was a furry , four - legged omnivore that evolved into a range of amphibious species 50 million years ago			2
over time , whales lost the connection between their backbone and hind legs , then gradually lost the hind legs completely			1
whales are thought to have evolved into fully aquatic species around 45 million years ago so far , fossilised remains of over 15 of the majestic marine mammals have been discovered in the @entity83 desert some 310 kilometers ( 190 miles ) south of the capital @entity85			2
' there is probably a greater number of fossils in the sand but it takes high - tech equipment to locate and recover them , ' said @entity93 , who heads a team during a tour of the site , which spans 45 square kilometres			0
this is the first time that such an old sea mammal has been found in @entity20 up until now , evidence of ancient sea mammals such as this had only been found in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 it is thought the bodies were preserved by the low level of oxygen in the substrate , which delayed decay caused by bacteria			1
in february last year , experts located the remains of a minke whale believed to be 3.6 million years old			0
' it is a species known only in @entity4 , ' mr @entity93 said , estimating that the whale weighed about 500 kilograms ( 1,100 pounds ) and measured six meters in length			0
in 2008 researchers found remains of a sperm whale ( @entity118 ) that were 12 million years old			0
a decade ago , mr @entity93 also came across the jaw and three - meter skull of a giant shark , considered a mega predator , that lived off the @entity4 coast			0
so far , fossilised remains of over 15 of the majestic marine mammals have been discovered in the @entity83 desert some 310 kilometers ( 190 miles ) south of the capital @entity85			0

@entity68 had more developed legs that resembled its land - based ancestors
this may shed light on how whales went from being amphibious to aquatic
it is the first time such an old sea mammal has been found in @entity20
