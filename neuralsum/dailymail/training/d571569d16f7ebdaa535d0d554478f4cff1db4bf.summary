the video of a @entity2 officer appearing to racially profile two @entity4 men because they are wearing traditional @entity6 clothes has been exposed as a hoax			1
shamelessly seeking to exploit recent tensions sparked in @entity10 by the choking death of @entity12 in july , the video was created by two filmmakers hoping to create and profit from viral content on @entity16			1
@entity18 residents @entity19 and @entity20 , who produce shareable content under the name ' @entity23 ' released the video entitled , ' @entity25 ' over the weekend - duping many media outlets around the world			2
scroll down for @entity28 fight : @entity19 and @entity20 begin brawling on the street while what appears to be an @entity2 officer with his face blurred just watches however , some were not quite so eager to throw yet more allegations of racism at @entity2 and quickly realized that despite being viewed more than 140,000 times , the video was fake			1
@entity23 boasts more than 60 million @entity16 views and they count more than 661,000 subscribers on the video sharing site - raking in tens of thousands of dollars from advertizing revenue from commericials that play before their content			2
they generally post comedy videos and prank the public and in the ' @entity48 ' the scene opens with @entity19 and @entity20 arguing loudly in the street			0
they are wearing jeans and t - shirts and push and shove each other and look like they are about to exchange punches			1
all the while , just visible in the frame is a what appears to be a @entity2 officer , with his face blurred , standing , passively watching			1
hoax : @entity19 and @entity20 appear to be immediately approached by the same officer 20 minutes later wearing @entity6 clothes according to their debunked video the argument was staged , the video gives the impression the police officer is real and was filmed by a friend in a parked car			1
the video then claims to jump forward 20 minutes and sees @entity19 and @entity20 wearing traditional @entity6 garb			1
they describe these garments as their ' cultural clothes			0
' quickly , they begin arguing again , but this time the cop , with his face still blurred approaches them immediately , asking , ' what ’s all the arguing about ? why are you dressed like this ? ' the officer then rams @entity19 against the wall and frisks him and demands , ' what is this ? what ’s in your pocket ? ' it is his phone , but the officer yells , ' is this a gun ? is that a knife ? ' the officer does not seem to remove the item nor appear concerned that @entity20 is standing near to him			0
friends : the two are from @entity18 and run their viral @entity16 video content channel @entity102 humor : they usually make comedic videos that pole fun at social issues - the purported @entity2 hoax is a departure for them the two then make their ' reveal ' and tell the cop they were the same guys arguing 20 minutes before and that he has been caught out racially profiling them			1
the now chastened officer seems to want to leave the scene and then the video ends with a request for a thumbs up and to subsribe to their @entity16 channel			2
the @entity119 showed the clip to a @entity2 source who works at the 110th precinct nearby to the @entity124 neighborhood where the clip was filmed			0
he said that an officer would never be standing idly on a deserted street corner and said his uniform and utility belt were incorrect			0
he also questioned the officer 's frisking			0
' that ’s not how they teach you in the academy , ' he told @entity137 and also poured scorn on the idea that an officer would ask a @entity4 man why he was dressed in a certain way			2
a second source told @entity137 that this was an ' obvious hoax ' designed to ' smear the police '			0
@entity19 and @entity20 have been sent messages asking to respond , but have not yet done so .			0
