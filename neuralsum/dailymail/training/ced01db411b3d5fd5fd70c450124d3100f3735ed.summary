@entity0 defends his @entity2 championship @entity3 describes @entity5 appointment as a ' joke ' tennis is part of a sporting landscape in which only 31 per cent of coaches are women by @entity12 follow @ @ laura_mail the most remarkable aspect of @entity0 beginning the defence of his @entity2 gentleman ’s singles title is not that he is the first @entity17 man to do so for 77 years , but that there will be a female coach in the players ’ box on @entity22			1
@entity23 , is n’t it ? you wait all this time for a @entity17 men ’s champion and then he turns out to be a groundbreaker in more ways than one			2
in 2014 , an elite male tennis player ’s decision to hire as his coach a ‘ lady ’ , as we women are so politely called at the @entity36 , is considered trailblazing			1
trailblazer : @entity0 appointed @entity5 as his coach - a groundbreaking move in tennis up and away : @entity0 puts in some practice on his serve during his session on sunday @entity3 , maybe still slightly irked that her 1977 @entity2 triumph has been overshadowed by a @entity17 man doing the business , thinks it ‘ a joke ’ , while others resort to pig - headed sexism when considering @entity0 ’s revolutionary act			1
@entity0 ’s decision to appoint @entity5 should be celebrated			1
tennis is part of a sporting landscape in which only 31 per cent of coaches are women			1
how many can you name off the top of your head ? only one of the eight clubs in the top tier of the @entity65 , for example , has a woman in charge and not one of the world ’s top - 20 female tennis players has a full - time female coach			1
men are apparently expected to coach other men because , of course , they have ‘ played the game ’ themselves			2
and yet there is no barrier to them coaching in women ’s competitions that would have been alien to them as players			1
no daft , old - fashioned arguments about entering locker - rooms or whether late - night tactical analysis might lead to an altogether different type of relationship			2
no problem : @entity0 , who hit the @entity36 practice courts on sunday , defended his appointment of @entity5 following criticism from @entity2 legend @entity3 ( r ) there is a valid argument in tennis for wanting your trainer to also be your hitting partner but a sport such as athletics has no such get - out clause			1
at a time when many a coach ’s beer belly provides a useful shelf for his stopwatch , only three female coaches had athletes competing for @entity17 at the weekend ’s @entity106 in @entity107			1
@entity108 , who coaches @entity109 and @entity110 — two of the country ’s most talented young sprinters — quickly provides an insight as to why that might be			1
@entity108 is married with two children , aged six and eight , and is also a part - time pe teacher working in sprinting , with all of its macho , testosterone - fuelled connotations			1
her admission that it can be ‘ very , very challenging ’ is clearly something of an understatement			2
‘ at some points it has n’t been a labour of love , ’ she says			2
‘ there were times that , because of the sexism in the sport , of not being recognised or valued for the contribution i made , i did think “ what ’s the point ? ” ‘ but then i ’m not in it to be put on a pedestal			0
what motivates me is seeing athletes achieve what they want to achieve , on whatever level that might be			0
and if i give up , it wo n’t get any better			0
sealed with a kiss : @entity17 no 1 @entity0 will be hoping to successfully defend his @entity2 crown this year ‘ you have to be a certain type of character to survive			1
you have to be strong because coaching is hard			0
’ it is hard , as well as being time - consuming , unsociable and voluntary for more than three - quarters of the @entity17 ’s coaches , none of which are exactly conducive to bringing up a family			2
there are therefore scarily few role models for female coaches , while stereotypes about women offering better emotional support but less authority seem to persist			1
‘ it ’s great to see a female like @entity5 in the limelight , ’ says @entity108			1
‘ it ’s amazing she ’s doing it			0
when you see another female coach it ’s so exhilarating but we have to be good at what we do , too			0
‘ there ’s still a hangover from the past			0
you ask all athletes , male and female , whether they would like a female coach and i think 90 per cent of them would still say “ no ”			2
‘ that wo n’t change until more female coaches bring more people through , so it ’s about staying professional and pushing yourself			2
‘ i have to be different from what they expect			0
i do n’t need to be testosterone - driven to be a good coach and if i do a good job then my athletes will keep winning , simple as that			0
’ @entity186 accused @entity187 of a ‘ lack of respect ’ after seven @entity191 players were drug - tested following friday ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity193 , showing yet again just how out of touch football is when it comes to drugs in sport			0
even more disrespectful is @entity187 ’s claim they are setting a ‘ benchmark ... in the fight against doping ’			0
no positive tests at a @entity203 since @entity186 ’s in 1994 , so therefore nobody ’s cheating ? give over			0
hitting out : @entity206 legend @entity186 accused @entity187 of a ' lack of respect ' after seven @entity191 players were drug - tested after their win over @entity193 performance of the @entity211 's 2 - 0 win over @entity212			0
this was largely about the demise of @entity212 , but the joy , work ethic and energy of @entity218 , the so - called ‘ minnows ’ , were a pleasure to watch			0
performance of the week : @entity218 celebrated an unlikely win at the @entity223 to eliminate champions @entity212 from the @entity203 in the group stages			0
