global temperatures last year were the highest since records began in 1880 , according to @entity3 scientists			0
but as well as the increase of the planet ’s average temperature , climatologists are particularly concerned about melting sea ice in the @entity9			0
now a time - lapse animation has been created to show how fast the world 's oldest ice is vanishing			1
this still shows old ice ( in white ) and ice under a year old ( in blue ) in 1987 , since when amounts have declined made by the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) the annimation is based on @entity9 sea ice data that has been collected over the last 27 years			1
each winter , sea ice expands to fill the @entity9 basin , peaking in volume in march			0
every summer , the ice pack shrinks and is at its smallest in september			0
the ice that survives one summer melt or more becomes thicker and is more likely to survive over a longer period of time			2
each winter , sea ice expands to fill the @entity9 basin and every summer , the ice pack shrinks			0
the ice that survives one summer melt or more becomes thicker and is likely to survive over a longer period of time ( shown in ever lighter colours in this image )			1
the oldest ice - over nine years in age - is shown in white here the animation also shows how the @entity9 sea ice moves continually and escapes the @entity9 via the @entity47 , east of @entity48 ( pictured ) scientists at @entity51 and the @entity23 have both claimed that global temperatures last year were the highest since records began in 1880			1
temperatures across the world averaged 0.8 ° @entity56 ) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years			1
the @entity58 has also announced that 2014 was the hottest year for the @entity59 in records dating back to 1910			0
since 1880 , @entity61 ’s average surface temperature has warmed by about 0.8 ° @entity56 ) over the 20th century average , which @entity51 ’s scientists said is a trend that ’s largely driven by the increase in carbon dioxide and other human emissions into the planet ’s atmosphere			0
the majority of that warming has occurred in the past three decades , they claim			0
@entity73 , director of @entity51 ’s @entity74 ( @entity75 ) in @entity76 , said : ‘ while the ranking of individual years can be affected by chaotic weather patterns , the long - term trends are attributable to drivers of climate change that right now are dominated by human emissions of greenhouse gases			2
but since the 1980s the amount of old , hardy ice , known as perennial or multiyear ice , has declined			2
the animation charts the vanishing of this ice from 1987 to november 2014			1
the dark blue areas in the video depicts first year ice that formed in the most recent winter , while the oldest ice , which is older than nine years old , is shown in white			1
dark grey areas indicate open water			0
by showing how the colours – the types of ice – change in the region , the animation emphasises how quickly the @entity9 is changing as the planet warms up			2
it also shows how the @entity9 sea ice moves continually and escapes the @entity9 via the @entity47 , east of @entity48			2
ice lost through the @entity47 used to be replaced by ice growth in the @entity107 , northeast of @entity108 , where perennial ice used to last for years			1
but this changed at the beginning of the 21st century when warmer waters made it less likely that ice would survive its passage though the south of the gyre			2
from 2008 onwards , the oldest ice has diminished to a narrow band along the @entity119 and in 2012 , the ice melt broke all previous records			1
after that worrying year , the melt was less severe in 2013 and 2014			0
data collected in march 2014 revealed that first year ice decreased from 78 to 69 per cent in 2014 , suggesting that a portion of @entity9 ice survived the 2013 melt , with the amount of second - year ice increasing from eight to 14 per cent			1
from 2008 onwards , the oldest ice diminished to a narrow band along the @entity119 and in 2012 , the ice melt broke all previous records			1
this screenshot from the animation showing peak 2014 pack levels , shows how little perennial ice there is fourth year ice also increased in quantity from just over seven to 10.2 per cent			1
overall , the amount of perennial sea ice recorded last spring was enough to meet the approximate 1981 - 2010 median			1
however , experts worry that the increase was a blip and that the long - term trend will continue to be downward			0
this is because in the 1980s , ice four years and older make up a quarter of the ice pack and as of march 2014 , this was just 10 per cent			2
ice over seven years old has also become increasingly rare			0
conservationists are concerned that polar bears ( stock image ) may one day become extinct because sea ice is melting earlier each year			0
this makes it difficult for the bears to hunt , mate and raise their young			0

*researchers* from the @entity160 - based @entity23 made the animation , based on data from 1987 to 2014
time - lapse video shows how fast old ice over nine years old is vanishing
in the video , new ice is shown dark blue , and old , perennial ice in white
from 2008 onwards , the oldest ice diminished to a narrow band along the @entity119 , with the band at its *slimmest* in 2012
