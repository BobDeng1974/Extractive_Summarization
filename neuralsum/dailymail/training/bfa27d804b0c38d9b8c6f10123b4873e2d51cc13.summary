by @entity0 published : 06:19 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 08:11 est , 6 august 2012 the oak is one of @entity4 's most recognisable emblems - and this could could be the greatest specimen			0
a 200 - year - old tree growing on the @entity10 ’s @entity9 estate in @entity11 has been named the tallest in @entity12			1
oaks usually oak trees grow upwards for the first 50 years of their life , then outwards			1
@entity17 view : @entity10 worker @entity19 by the enormous tree , left , and the tree from a distance , right this one , however , has grown thinner and higher , thanks to the other trees that crowd the same ancient copse , with which it must compete for light			1
the surrounding trees also mean the oak does not need to grow anchorage for itself			2
it stands on a north - facing slope that also boasts excellent soil and leaf mould for the perfect level of moisture			2
@entity10 experts have measured it by laser at a height of 131ft ( 40 metres ) but its official height will be confirmed when experts from @entity44 climb it and drop a tape measure from the highest twig			1
@entity9 boasts arguably the finest collection of trees in the country and already has the fattest @entity50 and the tallest @entity51			1
@entity52 , a @entity10 gardener and arboreal specialist , said : ' we ’ve measured it with a laser from various angles and it is between 39 and 42 metres high			1
@entity59 shoots : the tree has grown thinner and higher than most because it is surrounded by other trees and has fought for the light ' the highest oak at present is 40 metres but we think that will have to be re-measured and we ’re confident this will be the tallest			1
' it will be officially measured by someone from the @entity44 who will climb to the top and drop a line from the highest branch			0
' this has grown so high for a number of reasons , one of which is because it is surrounded by other trees in an ' oak stand '			2
' this means it is drawn to the light but also the other trees protect it so it does n’t need the strength of anchorage that it would if it were on its own			2
perfect conditions : the soil in the area is excellent , the conditions moist and the anchorage already in place thanks to other plants ' those types of oaks tend to be short and stumpy			1
it is also in a natural , mixed woodland and nothing is taken away from it			0
' the soil is excellent and there is a good amount of leaf mould as well as green - sand and clay			0
' the leaf mould help retains the moisture so it never dries out even in a drought			0
and it is on a north facing slope so it is shaded			0
' it has been completely untouched and you can see broken branches and things			0
' we do n’t know if it was planted deliberately or whether it just grew naturally from an acorn			0
' back when the tree sprouted , the country had almost run out of good oak wood , which was in great demand to build boats for the @entity124 .			0

*incredible* growth is thanks to the perfect conditions in the ancient copse
@entity130 has shot upwards as it competes with other trees for light
@entity10 estate already home to the fattest @entity50 and the tallest @entity51
