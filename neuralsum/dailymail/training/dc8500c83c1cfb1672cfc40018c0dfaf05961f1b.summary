when he discovered he had run up a £ 3,700 bill on his father ’s credit card playing games on his @entity5 , @entity0 expected a very stern telling off at least			2
the 13 - year - old was mortified by what he had done – but worse was to come			0
for instead of punishing him , his father filed an official police complaint effectively accusing him of fraud			1
@entity11 , 48 , said he was horrified when his credit card company informed him of the amount his son had spent on the games in @entity17 ’s online @entity16			1
charges : mr @entity0 claims his son was unaware he was being charged for the in - game purchases and wants @entity17 to scrap the charge @entity0 could now face arrest and questioning by detectives			1
but that is not the reason the teenager was shopped			0
if mr @entity0 had wanted him to feel the force of the law he could have done it himself – he is a pc with @entity32			0
he contacted the national @entity33 in the hope of getting his money back from @entity17			1
he says @entity0 was unaware he was being charged for the purchases and wants @entity17 to refund the cash			1
but the technology giant has so far refused , so mr @entity0 believes that by reporting the purchases as fraudulent his credit card company will have to foot the bill			1
mr @entity0 , of @entity42 , @entity43 , said yesterday : ‘ i am sure @entity0 had no intention to do it , but i had to have a crime reference number if there was any chance of getting any credit card payments refunded			0
‘ in theory the local police station would contact me and ask for @entity0 to come in to be interviewed			2
i could make it difficult , of course , and refuse to bring him in , and they would have to come and arrest him			2
’ games : @entity0 racked up more than 300 purchases on games such as @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 3 on the @entity5 mr @entity0 logged the details of his @entity66 credit card with @entity17 when he used his son ’s device to download music			1
@entity0 then racked up more than 300 purchases on games such as @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity70			2
many of them are free to download but users can buy in - game extras			0
in one game @entity0 had purchased a virtual chest of gold coins costing £ 77.98			0
he would have had to key in a password before each of the purchases was processed			2
when his father confronted him , @entity0 quickly confessed but said he did not know it was costing money as the games were initially free			1
plants vs zombies : one of the games @entity0 purchased on the @entity5 mr @entity0 said : ‘ there was no indication in the game that he was being charged for any of the clicks made within it			2
‘ he innocently thought that , because it was advertised as a free game , the clicks would not cost anything			0
’ @entity17 has refused to cancel the charges , citing parental responsibility and pointing out that @entity5 contain password locks to prevent accidental or unwanted purchases			1
aid : @entity0 has only owned the @entity17 tablet computer since december after he and other pupils at his school were bought them to aid them in class but mr @entity0 said : ‘ i am a father of a studious , polite and sensible 13 - year - old who has been duped after uploading free children ’s games on his @entity109 and @entity5			1
‘ our son is mortified to think that this has happened			2
i wonder how many others there are in the @entity115 that have suffered at the hands of these apps ? ’ of his decision to report @entity0 to @entity119 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ really i just want to embarrass @entity17 as much as possible			1
morally , i just do n’t understand where @entity17 gets off , charging for a child ’s game			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity124 , which runs @entity119 , said last night : ‘ it sounds like this would be a matter to resolve with @entity17			1
it does n’t sound like a fraud has taken place			0
’ @entity0 could in theory end up with a criminal record as he is over the age of ten			0
but a legal source doubted whether the @entity134 would think a prosecution was in the public interest			0
@entity137 has declined to comment on the case			0
with more than half a billion active accounts , the @entity16 is the most popular online marketplace in the world			0
mr @entity0 is among a growing number of parents caught out by their children ’s unauthorised spending on apps			0
earlier this year , five - year - old @entity146 spent £ 1,700 buying weapons and ammunition in the @entity5 game zombies vs @entity150			0
@entity17 refunded the money to his parents @entity153 and @entity154			1
in the @entity155 , @entity17 is paying £ 66million in compensation to parents whose children ran up huge bills			1
the case is unlikely to affect @entity115 families this is by no means the first case of a parent being shocked to find their child had run up a huge bill on their computer by playing games			0
earlier this month @entity170 reported how @entity171 had racked up a £ 980 bill by buying virtual doughnuts while playing a @entity175 game			0
and just last month five - year - old @entity146 ( pictured right ) , from @entity176 , made 19 purchases totalling more than £ 1,300 for extra software to help him play the game zombies vs @entity150			2
by pressing a shopping trolley icon on the screen , @entity146 was offered the chance to buy extra animated ‘ ammunition ’			0
he bought dozens of in - game ‘ weapons ’ and ‘ keys ’ which cost up to £ 69.99 a time			0
his parents were refunded after they contacted @entity17			1
customers who accidentally rack up large bills on @entity190 do not have an automatic right to a refund , although @entity17 does appear willing to return the cash on a case - by - case basis			1
but in the @entity155 , the company is paying out £ 66million in compensation to parents whose children ran up massive bills while using its free apps			2
now , as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund			0
however , the decision is unlikely to affect @entity115 families			0
a @entity155 legal case was triggered by a nine - year - old girl from @entity206 who bought $ 200 ( £ 132 ) of ' virtual money ' from three free @entity17 games			1
in a lawsuit brought by her father , the games were described as ' highly addictive ' and designed to ' compel ' children to buy game currency			2
under the terms of the case settlement , @entity17 has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $ 100million ( £ 66million ) .			1

father claims teenage son was unaware he was being charged
wants @entity17 to scrap the charge but company has so far refused
only way to recoup money is to report purchases as fraudulent
son could now face arrest and questioning by police
