@entity0 , 63 , allegedly started abusing the boy in 1993 when she gave him wine and stripped down to her underwear to sunbathe during a tutoring session at his home , a jury heard			1
the alleged abuse continued until 1996 , when the boy was 15			1
@entity19 @entity18 heard how ms @entity0 , then in her 40s , started touching the teenager through his shorts and the pair later had sex after she had fetched a condom from her car			1
prosecutor @entity29 said that for the next two years the pair regularly had sex at the boy ’s home while his parents were out			1
she claimed that at other times they had sex at ms @entity0 's home and at local hunt meetings which she attended			1
the pair would often drink and smoke cannabis together , she said			0
ms @entity0 from @entity42 , near @entity19 , has pleaded not guilty to six charges of indecent assault , all against the same boy , when he was aged between 13 and 15 from september 1993 to september 1996			1
she was said to have had an ' otherwise glowing career ' and ' has never been in trouble '			0
the alleged victim , now aged 33 and a father - of - three , at first thought their relationship was ' brilliant ' the court heard			1
but he said that having two teenage boys of his own made him realise that what had happened to him when he was younger was wrong			2
mrs @entity29 said that the boy , who lived in @entity57 , had been excluded from school when he was 12 and mrs @entity0 was one of the home tutors appointed to teach him			1
the court heard that she would visit his home two to three times a week and was given her own key to the house to let herself in			1
she would sometimes go into the boy ’s bedroom to wake him - even though he slept naked , mrs @entity29 said			2
mrs @entity29 said that when ms @entity0 initiated the relationship the boy threw himself ‘ wholeheartedly ’ into it			1
she said : ' this case is about a distorted relationship between an adult teacher and a child that was in her care			0
' it is an unusual case and you may think that immediately because there is a woman in the dock			0
' he was excluded from school and that is why he came into contact with her			0
he was using drugs and had been in trouble with the police			0
' in her police interview she talks about him in terms that are relatively affectionate			0
she talks about him as someone with potential			0
@entity19 @entity18 heard how ms @entity0 , then in her 40s , started touching the teenager through his shorts and the pair later had sex after she had fetched a condom from her car ' she smoked cannabis with him on occasions and on occasions they drank together			1
' she saw him in circumstances that were inappropriate and the two of them had regular sexual intercourse			0
they would spend a great deal of time together			2
' it was a relationship that developed over time , but in reality it was abuse because she was a woman in her 40s and he was a child			2
' the relationship ended when the boy ceased education at the age of 15 and said he did not want to take any exams , said the prosecutor			2
he had sex twice more with ms @entity0 when he was in his early twenties after he went back to his former tutor asking for a job reference			1
but , said the prosecutor , he realised that the teacher did not have the same interest in him as an adult mature male as she did when he was an immature boy			2
' she said , " do you mind if i make myself more comfortable ? " i said " whatever " and she ended up taking her top off ' in 2012 he felt troubled about what had happened in his youth and he told his partner and his mother			0
that led to him going to a sexual abuse referral centre and , as a result , calling the police			0
mrs @entity29 said that when ms @entity0 was arrested , she denied that anything untoward had taken place and insisted their relationship was entirely innocent			1
in evidence , the alleged victim said it was when his own sons reached the ages of 12 and 13 that he realised what had happened to him as a boy was wrong - even though he had thought it was ‘ brilliant ’ at the time			1
he told the jury of the day when ms @entity0 seduced him as they sat on his patio on a ‘ blazing hot day ’ when he was 13			1
' she said , " do you mind if i make myself more comfortable ? " i said " whatever "			0
' she ended up taking her top off			0
she was in her bra			0
then she took her trousers down and was in her underwear			2
@entity0 , pictured outside court today , said that her relationship with the alleged victim was innocent ' i was thinking a few things			1
i was a young boy and i ’m not saying i was n’t			2
' i did find myself getting aroused			0
i tried to hide it basically			0
but she cottoned on and she sort of giggled a bit			0
' she said " do n’t worry about it , do n’t be embarrassed			0
any man would in this sort of situation			0
" he said that at that point he reciprocated her advances , adding , ' it does n’t take much to develop the situation from there , does it ? ' he said that ms @entity0 then retrieved a condom from her car before they had sex for the first time outside on her patio			1
he said : ' i thought it was brilliant - i was 13 years old			2
' he told the jury that despite what had happened to him he felt bad about ms @entity0 being prosecuted because she had been a good teacher and a friend and he would not be able to read and write as well as he does if it had not been for her teaching			2
but he added : ' i have got children now and if the same sort of thing happened to them at that age i would not be a happy person			0
' as i get older i realised it was not right			0
i did n’t look at it as abuse at the time , but now as a man in his thirties i know if i touched a 13 - year - old girl i would expect the full force of the law			2
' he told the court that at the time of the alleged abusse , however , he thought the teacher , whom he called ‘ mrs k ’ , was as ' cool as a cucumber ' because of the way she dressed , her music tastes and the fact she got cannabis for them to smoke together			1
earlier , mrs @entity29 had told the jury that during the first sex session between ms @entity0 and the boy the condom split			1
