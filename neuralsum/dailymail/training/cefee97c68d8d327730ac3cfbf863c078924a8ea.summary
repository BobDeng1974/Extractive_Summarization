two more police forces have been caught asking @entity2 newsagents which sold copies of satirical magazine @entity4 for details of the customers who bought it			1
officers from @entity10 and @entity11 police have approached shopkeepers and demanded personal information on readers of the magazine , according to reports			1
it comes after police in @entity19 caused outrage by demanding similar details be handed over in the wake of the @entity24 attacks			2
it appears that @entity26 ( @entity27 ) was handed a list of @entity4 's @entity2 stockists by @entity30 , one of the the magazine 's @entity2 distributors			1
@entity27 then alerted forces who had shops selling @entity4 in their area , saying that officers should be aware that the magazine was on sale			1
according to an @entity27 spokesman , the alert suggested that police may wish to visit the shops involved , but only if there were signs of rising tensions			2
a @entity19 police officer visited a small newsagents and post office in @entity19 and requested the personal details of all subscribers to the @entity4 magazine ( pictured ) , which was the subject of a terrorist attack			1
now it has emerged that officers in @entity10 and @entity11 have also approached shopkeepers the @entity27 advice did not recommend visiting each shop , and did not mention taking down the details of customers who had bought the publication , according to the spokesman			1
it would appear that the three forces concerned either misunderstood the advice , or acted on their own impulse when they decided to ask for information on customers			2
@entity30 initially denied leaking information to the police , but since @entity27 issued a statement to the contrary , they have refused to comment			0
@entity74 , another @entity4 distributor , has also refused to comment			1
the move has been branded ' entirely unacceptable ' by privacy campaigners			0
an @entity27 spokesman said : ' @entity30 , as the distributor for @entity4 within the @entity2 , provided the police service , through the @entity80 , with a list of outlets which were stocking the edition of @entity4 released following the @entity24 atrocities			1
' this was done so that local officers could be aware of any potential tensions on their beat arising from the sales of the magazine , given the situation following the killings			1
' at no point was any guidance given from a national level to forces asking them to act on the information passed over by @entity30 , and no national advice was given to forces that they should visit stockists or ask them for further information			1
' some newsagents may have been visited by officers seeking to provide reassurance to business owners but decisions on doing so will have been made at a local level			2
' the police service ’s duty in this matter is to protect the communities it serves and defuse tensions where they exist			0
' @entity115 , 57 , owner of a newsagent in @entity117 , @entity10 , said a detective and a police community support officer arrived at his shop and started to question his wife about the people who bought them			1
he said : ' they wanted to know where we had got them from , and did we know who we had sold them to			0
@entity130 has since apologised for the incident and said the officer 's motivation was ' purely around enhancing public safety '			2
the force said that information obtained during the visit had been ' disposed of ' ' [ my wife ] said she was n't prepared to give any names			0
she thought we were in trouble for selling them originally , but they said we were n't , and they just wanted to know who bought them			0
' we did n't give them any details			0
it was all very strange			0
there were a couple of customers in here at the time , so it soon got around town			0
' a @entity158 police spokesman said : ' as part of ongoing community engagement and following recent terrorism incidents globally @entity162 have been undertaking an assessment of community tensions across the force area			0
' as part of this assessment it was decided that it would be prudent to visit newsagents who maybe distributing the @entity4 magazine to offer proportionate advice and reassurance due to the heightened publicity surrounding the publication			1
' it was not the intention to gather any personal information of those who purchased the magazine and we can confirm no purchaser details were asked for or @entity184 can confirm the visits were only made to enhance public safety and to provide community reassurance			2
' the @entity188 reports that in @entity190 , @entity11 , a police officer also called a newsagent that had sold the copy , and asked for information on the customer			1
but @entity11 police denied this was the case			1
a spokesman said : ' officers were asked to call into local newsagents in their area to provide visible reassurance around the time of publication and were not asked under any circumstances to make enquiries as to who was purchasing or preordering the @entity4 magazine			1
' each area endeavored to visit as many newsagents as possible however we can not provide an exact figure			0
' @entity211 , 77 , was among those who ordered a copy of the publication and said she was ' baffled ' by police wanting the names of those who bought it @entity219 , director of @entity220 , said : ' the @entity4 attack brought millions of people worldwide together to condemn those who seek to silence free speech through threats of intimidation and violence			1
' this move by the police is entirely unacceptable			0
this sort of investigation would be understandable if a crime was being committed , but the fact is that they have requested information about people who have purchased a perfectly legal publication			2
' it is far from clear why the police thought it was acceptable to request this information or what it is that they actually intend to do with it			0
considering the comments made in the aftermath of the attacks in @entity24 by world leaders , that free speech should be celebrated and encouraged , the moves by the police in the @entity2 completely undermine that			1
' @entity19 officers asked at least three newsagents for people 's details			1
the force apologised after admitting that an officer had taken down the names of four people in the town of @entity261 who bought the magazine featuring a cartoon of the @entity265 on the front			1
earlier this week @entity267 , 63 , was told by his local shop in @entity269 , @entity270 , that an officer had asked for his name after he bought a copy for his 21 - year - old son , who studied @entity275 at university			2
he said : ' i am astounded that this intrusion has occurred and wonder what right the police have to check up on what i and others are reading			0
' surely their time would be better spent hunting deranged people who want to behead citizens on our streets			0
' he said his newsagent told him that anther stockist in a nearby town had also been asked about @entity4 customers			2
' i can not fathom out what link they think exists between a local person in a small town in @entity297 , a satirical @entity275 magazine and some terrorists , ' he said			2
' trust in the police is low and this type of official or unofficial snooping on private individuals will not improve the situation			0
they are acting like the @entity307			0
' grandmother @entity308 , 77 , was also told by her newsagent in @entity261 that police had asked for her name , and the names of others who had ordered @entity4			1
the retired nurse said : ' i was cross – what 's wrong with me wanting to buy it ? it 's an intrusion , and in terms of free speech it 's worrying really			0
' hundreds of @entity2 queued for a copy of the £ 3.50 souvenir edition of the magazine , published following last month 's attack by @entity326 extremists on its offices which left 12 people dead			1
@entity219 , director of @entity220 , said : ' the @entity4 attack brought millions of people worldwide together to condemn those who seek to silence free speech			2
twelve people were killed when gunmen ( pictured ) stormed the office of @entity4 in @entity24 on january 7 the @entity24 massacre led to an outpouring of support around the world , including the ' @entity341 ' message ' it is therefore alarming that overzealous police officers are attempting to find out who has bought a perfectly legal publication			1
we have to hope that these are isolated cases			0
' @entity348 , director of human rights organisation @entity349 , said the officers ' may have had good intentions , but the road to oppression is paved that way '			0
@entity130 said it had carried out an ' assessment of community tensions ' after the @entity24 attacks			0
as part of this , officers were asked to be ' mindful ' of newsagents that were stocking the magazine			2
a spokesman said : ' a police officer visited a local shop and post office in @entity261 to make an assessment of community tensions ... during this conversation the officer requested information about subscribers to the @entity4 magazine			1
' @entity130 would like to apologise to the members of public who may be affected			0
[ this information ] has been permanently and securely disposed of			0
' a spokesman for @entity377 said they were ' not currently aware of anything regarding the incident ' .			0

@entity130 requested details of people who bought @entity4
now officers in @entity10 and @entity11 have also approached shopkeepers
@entity2 distributor passed details of shops stocking the magazine to police
police chiefs then told *specific* forces where magazine was being sold
but chiefs say they never advised officers to take down names of buyers
local officers may have understood advice or taken the guidance too far
