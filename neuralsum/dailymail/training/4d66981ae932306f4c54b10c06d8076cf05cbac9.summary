by @entity0 published : 14:33 est , 30 december 2012 updated : 07:20 est , 1 january 2013 anger : @entity3 justice minister @entity2 said today the attempted murder of a police officer in @entity6 was an attack on all of @entity8 a second viable pipe bomb - type device has been discovered near a police station in @entity8			1
elderly residents were evacuated from their homes in @entity14 , @entity15 , but have been allowed to return as the security alert has ended			1
@entity18 technical officers examined the object close to the gates of the town 's @entity21 ( @entity21 ) station , a short distance south of @entity25			1
@entity26 and @entity28 assembly member @entity27 condemned those responsible			0
' this is a very concerning incident especially in a rural town like @entity14 and it is especially concerning when so many residents , many of whom are elderly , have had to leave their homes whilst this suspect device is dealt with , ' he said			1
' no one in @entity14 wants this type of disruption and indeed considering the threat to our police officers remains so high at the moment , having devices left at police stations is extremely reckless and totally abhorrent			1
' young families also go for walks out the @entity15 road and pass the station gates , which only adds to the risk this suspect device could have posed			1
' it comes after a booby trap device was discovered under an officer ’s car in east @entity6			1
police have said the unexploded but viable bomb , which was discovered by the off duty policeman on sunday afternoon , was clearly intended to kill him			1
the constable was about to take his wife and two young children out for sunday lunch yesterday when he checked under his car outside his house in the city and discovered a viable device			1
assistant chief constable @entity68 said : ' if that officer had not checked under his car we would have been looking at a murder or multiple murders			1
' let us be clear			2
this was an attack not only on a police officer and his family but on our whole community			1
the officer was serving the community ; he was working for all of us			2
' the people responsible for this and other recent attacks have no mandate and speak for no - one			2
they need to recognise the futility of their campaign and respect the wishes of the vast majority of our community who want an end to all violent acts			0
' the car was parked off @entity118 is one of the busiest arterial routes into @entity6			1
the officer 's home is close to @entity21 headquarters at @entity3 and the @entity124 at @entity3			1
residents of nearby homes were evacuated to a local church while army technical officers worked to make the scene safe			0
assassination attempt : police evacuated residents and closed @entity133 whilst army technical experts dealt with a ' viable bomb ' found under the police officer 's car outside his home police believe the murder attempt is the work of rebel republicans who ' do n't care who they attack and do n't care who they kill , ' @entity68 said			1
' they are simply anti-peace and determined to carry on bringing pain and devastation to families and communities by maiming and killing			0
' he said it was very fortunate that the device was detected in time so that no - one was killed or seriously injured			2
dismantling : it is believe the policeman discovered the viable bomb himself around 2pm yesterday afternoon after which security forces were called ' initial investigations would indicate that this was a viable device placed below an officer 's car sometime in the last 48 hours			1
' it was clearly intended to kill the police officer			2
his family and neighbours in the vicinity were also put at risk of serious harm			0
' obviously there are people out there who are still intent on causing murder and mayhem			0
' @entity176 , chairman of officers ' representative body the @entity179 , said the device was planted by ' cowardly thugs '			0
‘ this was an attempt to murder an off - duty police officer , ’ he said			1
‘ but this attack is no great surprise			0
scores of police officers have been forced from their homes in the last 12 months because of terrorist incidents			2
this is just the latest of many			0
‘ it reinforces the need for officers to be extra vigilant			0
’ @entity196 @entity195 member for @entity6 @entity197 condemned those responsible			2
‘ those who placed this potential bomb have nothing to offer the community except heartache and sorrow , ’ he said			2
‘ the thugs who carry out this type of an action are rejected by the vast majority of the community as being wicked and evil ... who care nothing for innocent life			0
‘ i pay tribute to the @entity21 officers and the bomb squad officers who risked their lives to make the area safe not only for the intended victim but all who live in close proximity			1
’ moving in : after police evacuate the street , an army bomb disposal expert prepares to examine the bomb on @entity118 in east @entity6 breathing out : the bomb expert examines and secures the booby trap bomb found underneath the car @entity230 mla @entity229 said : ’ my immediate thoughts and prayers are with the officer and family directly affected by this cowardly and futile act and the people working to restore safety to all residents in the area			1
@entity8 dissidents have repeatedly targeted security force members in recent years in a bid to destabilise the peace process			0
in november long - serving prison officer @entity245 , 52 , was shot dead in a motorway ambush in @entity15 as he drove to work			1
the attack was claimed by a group styling itself the ' new @entity250 ' which was formed in the summer when a number of splinter groups joined forces			0
in april 2011 newly qualified police officer @entity255 ( top right ) , 25 , died when a booby trap car bomb exploded under his vehicle at his home in @entity259			1
‘ those behind this incident have absolutely nothing to offer the local community and are only intent on taking @entity8 back to a time of deep division through violent attacks			0
‘ anyone , from whatever background , considering an attack on the @entity21 should remember that officers have the full support of the vast majority of people across @entity8			2
' any attack will only serve to risk misery to families and resolve the will of this community to reject violence in favour of peace			0
’ @entity283 policing board member @entity282 said the murder bid was a ' cynical and deplorable act '			0
‘ those seeking to target police officers are undermining not only the stated will of the people of @entity8 who have long since rejected violence , but also the desire for a new beginning for policing in the @entity293 , which is shared by the majority of citizens , ’ he said			0
chief constable @entity68 appealed for anyone with information on the latest murder bid to come forward			0
' attacks on police officers are attacks on the entire community and can not be allowed to continue , ' he said			0
' we know there are people within our communities who know who did this , we know there are people out there who know exactly what is being planned			0
double threat : the bomb was discovered yesterday afternoon close to the policeman 's home which is located near the @entity21 @entity316 ' the community can be assured that the @entity21 will do everything possible within the law to bring those responsible to justice			1
' however it is very important that we get information about this incident quickly			0
we need support from members of the public in bringing those responsible to justice			0
