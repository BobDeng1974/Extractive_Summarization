by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 14:00 est , 15 january 2013 she may not look like your average crime - fighter , but great - grandmother @entity4 has been keeping the streets of her hometown safe for the last few months with her lone nightly patrols			1
mrs @entity4 , 87 , forgoes an early night with a cup of cocoa to patrol the streets near her from 11pm until 3am to help drunks in distress and prevent fights before they happen			1
the retired postmistress thwarts potential trouble by handing out jelly babies and chocolate to feuding yobs to calm them down and has even been called @entity19			2
fighting crime with sweets : @entity4 volunteers as a @entity22 with her local church , offering @entity24 to revellers to prevent drunken fights on friday and saturday night in @entity27 , @entity28 good samaritan : @entity4 has five grandchildren and three great - grandchildren - some of whom she sees on nights out while acting as a ' street pastor ' she also has a stash of flip - flops in her backpack to hand to women who can no longer manage walking home in their high heels so they do n't have to go bare - footed			1
the kind - heated even phones taxis for party - goers who are too drunk to call themselves			2
the five - foot - tall widow , who worked as a nurse in the @entity46 , is part of a team looking after weekend revellers falling out of the pubs and nightclubs in @entity27 , @entity28 , as a @entity22 with her local church			1
she said : ' i love every minute of my role and we are well received on the streets by all the pub and club goers			2
rewarding work : mrs @entity4 says she loves ' every minute ' while out on the streets helping people make their way home ' my five grandchildren said it was too dangerous to be on the streets at that time of night - but i have never been frightened and many of the people we meet tell me i remind them of their own grandmothers			1
' she added : ' the police say that they could n't do what we do because we go out as friends rather than as an authority figure with armour			0
' we are meeting with people and talking to punters , bar managers and doormen all night and i have always got a little stash of jelly babies to keep me going			0
' i can only recall a couple of unpleasant arguments between people when they come out of the pubs			2
' i will go over and hand out some chocolate and jelly babies and start chatting to them and by the time they leave they 've calmed down and the good news is they 've probably forgotten what they were arguing about			2
' i sometimes bump into my grandchildren in the early hours and they still tell me off saying i should be at home in bed at that time - but i think they know now i 'm independent enough to handle it			2
' mrs @entity4 , who has done various types of voluntary work in the community , became a @entity22 after her church group got involved in dealing with problem locals on the streets			1
she added : ' i am the oldest in the team and we patrol the streets from 11pm to 3am looking for people who need help after their night out			2
' we are all volunteers			0
there are people from different churches and we have a rota of who does which weekend			0
we start in the town centre and split up into different directions but never go further than where the bars and clubs are			0
' mrs @entity4 , along with the other volunteers , help pub and club goers who may be a little worse for wear when they leave to go home			1
taking no nonsense : as well as handing out sweets , mrs @entity4 hands out flip - flops to female revellers who can no longer walk in their high - heels , and even books cabs for those too drunk to do so she said : ' on a friday night there are three people who are out and on saturday we have four out because it 's the busy night			1
we have a break in between so we are n't out for four hours straight			0
there 's a rest and rescue room that we can go to for a cuppa			0
' we help people by putting them into taxis so that they get home safely			0
they come to us for flip flops because by the end of the night their feet might be hurting and we do n't want them to walk on glass			1
we also sweep up the smashed glass and put it all in the bin			0
brave : @entity4 , pictured on her wedding day in 1945 to her husband @entity158 , was also a nurse during @entity46 ' we have a nurse in the rescue room who tends to injuries , which happen quite often			1
some girls slip and fall in their high heels and hurt themselves on the floor where there might be smashed glass			1
that usually happens when they have had too much to drink			0
' despite the dark streets , mrs @entity4 says she feels safe			1
she added : ' there are cameras all around and we have phones so that we can contact each other throughout the night			0
' we had to do first aid training and go to various talks about what kind of problems we may come across , but that was very helpful because it prepares you for what might happen			0
' during the war i was a nurse though so i have a good background in first aid			2
' mrs @entity4 lived in @entity188 , @entity28 , with her late husband @entity158 where they ran a post office together until they retired			1
they retired to the seaside at @entity194 in 1985 , but her husband died just months later and mrs @entity4 returned to the @entity27 area			1
she added ' people always tell me i remind them of their grandmother , which is nice			0
i have one son , five grandchildren and three great grandchildren			0
' i remember one girl was really drunk and slumped on a bench and could n't speak			0
we had to stay with her and try to find out where she lived so that she could get home safe			0
it worries me how much young people drink these days			0
' i was once shouted at by a drunken man that i was like @entity19 but i suppose that 's not a bad thing			2
' the @entity22 started in @entity215 and @entity216 in @entity217 with just 18 volunteers and is now in 18 of @entity217 's 32 boroughs and over 20 other @entity221 locations with over 700 volunteers			1
a spokesman for the @entity27 group said : ' over the time we have been operating we have been informed by the police and @entity227 that they have noticed a remarkable decrease in the crime rate due to the ' over exuberance ' of some of our young people			1
' we have been involved in mediating between arguments , helping with first aid , alwaysensuring young people are safe whilst they are out enjoying themselves			0
@entity4 is a great asset to the team and very popular with the locals			1
