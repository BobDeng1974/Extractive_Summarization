by @entity0 published : 16:06 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 06:06 est , 10 december 2012 it may sound like something out of a sci - fi film , but reading text messages off contact lens in the eyes could soon be a reality - bringing a whole new meaning to the term ' instant messaging '			1
scientists have developed a new technology that allows electronic messages sent from mobile phones to be directly projected on to contact lens placed in the recipient 's eyes			1
the spherical curved lcd display , created by @entity19 researchers at @entity20 , handle projected images using wireless technology			1
they say it could one day be used to show emails and other information - and even lead to ' @entity32 glasses ' without the glasses the lens ' capability were demonstrated by scientists who showed a dollar sign being projected on to the lens			2
it is a step towards ' fully pixelated contact lens displays ' with the same detail as a tv screen which could completely transform the way we communicate			2
' normally , flexible displays using liquid crystal cells are not designed to be formed into a new shape , especially not a spherical one , ' said @entity48 , the main researcher on the project			0
' thus , the main challenge was to create a very thin , spherically curved substrate with active layers that could withstand the extreme molding processes , ‚Äù he said			0
' moreover , since we had to use very thin polymer films , their influence on the smoothness of the display had to be studied in detail			0
' by using new kinds of conductive polymers and integrating them into a smooth spherical cell , we were able to fabricate a new lcd - based contact lens display			0
' not far off : the lens that can receive text messages could be ready to go on sale in just a few years the new technology means the entire surface of the contact lens can be used to project images and messages			1
researchers are also looking at the possibility of also using the lens as sunglasses which adapt to the level of sunlight			2
@entity48 , the chief researcher on the project , added : ' this is not science fiction			0
' this will never replace the cinema screen for films			0
' but for specific applications it may be interesting to show images such as road directions or projecting text messages from our smart phones straight to our eye			1

text messages and images can be projected directly on to the lens using wireless technology
researchers at @entity20 believe the lens could be available to the public in just a few year
