@entity0 does n't want to talk about his best - selling ' @entity2 ' book , but everybody else does â€” including his own charity			1
three years ago , ' @entity5 ' and author @entity6 alleged that @entity0 fabricated much of the book and mismanaged the charity he co-founded , @entity8			1
the allegations pushed @entity0 to lock himself in his bedroom			1
he fought off depression and eventually underwent heart surgery			0
the @entity8 lost most of its donors , with contributions plummeting from a high of about $ 22million in 2010 to $ 2.7million last year			1
pictured above on tuesday in @entity22 , @entity23 @entity5 revealed that @entity0 made up large parts of his best - seller @entity2 , and its sequel stones into schools the organization 's new leaders have slashed the budget and cut school construction programs , but they still had to borrow from savings to meet expenses			1
board chairman @entity33 is worried about the organization 's long - term financial health			0
so @entity33 and the other board members are calling on @entity0 to help reverse the skid by appearing in promotional videos and resuming the speaking engagements he put on hold in 2011			1
@entity0 , who said he 's feels healthier than he has in 18 years , has reluctantly agreed			1
' there 's a lot of pressure on me to go out and start talking to the public and the media , which i was reluctant to do			0
not only because things kind of quieted down and i 'm kind of liking my life , but i also do n't want to have to open up all these cans of worms again , ' he said at his @entity22 home on tuesday			0
' i feel like a criminal coming back , ' he added			0
he knows the questions that will dog him			0
did he make up the story about how he decided to devote his life to building schools ? was he really kidnapped by the @entity59 when visiting a remote part of northwestern @entity61 ? did he lie to sell books ? @entity0 does n't relish the prospect of having to answer those questions , but that 's exactly what @entity8 wants			1
the organization wants @entity0 to tell his side of the story in hopes that it can move past the ' @entity5 ' piece and get back to educating children			1
@entity6 said wednesday that @entity0 must come clean before the public will forgive him			2
he believes that @entity8 will not prosper as long as @entity0 is its public face			1
' @entity0 needs to go , right now , ' @entity6 said			2
' until @entity0 is gone , there is no hope for having an honest organization			2
' @entity33 , for his part , said @entity0 must be involved in any effort to bring the institute back to financial stability			2
' @entity0 needs to go , right now ' : @entity84 - based author @entity6 revealed @entity0 's lies as well , and says he needs to step down from the foundation			1
pictured above on wednesday in @entity87 scrutiny : the book follows the adventures of co-author @entity0 , pictured in @entity91 , northeastern @entity92 in 2009 , as he set up schools in @entity61 and @entity92 ' @entity0 is recognizable , he commands an audience and people want to hear what happened , ' @entity33 said			1
' people are going to be wondering , so he has to be a part of it			0
' it 's a risky gambit , and @entity0 is not sure if the public will give him a second chance			2
but he said the @entity8 is doing good work by supporting the education of children , especially girls , in @entity61 , @entity92 and @entity106 , and it 's up to him to raise funds to make sure it can continue			1
' you wish the past could just be done with , but there are still a lot of questions			0
so i 'd like to answer those questions ( and ) let the public decide , but then let me move on and help those girls and kids overseas , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity0 apologized for letting people down			2
he insists the stories in ' @entity2 ' are true , though he has changed the telling of some of them since they were published			2
he also disputes the @entity23 attorney general 's findings that he enriched himself by taking charter flights on @entity8 's dime , and by keeping all the speakers ' fees and the royalties from books the organization bought and gave away			2
@entity0 's best - selling book ' @entity2 ' came under intense scrutiny after 60 minutes , author @entity6 and some people in the book said some of the stories were fabricated			1
here is a glance at some of those stories , what is being disputed and @entity0 's response in a recent interview with the @entity141			2
@entity143 's descent from @entity144 : @entity2 : @entity0 stumbled upon the @entity61 village of @entity146 in fall 1993 after trekking from the base camp of @entity144 , the world 's second - highest peak			1
he spent days in the village recovering from the descent			0
the dispute : @entity0 could not have wandered to @entity146 on that trip because it is on the opposite side of the @entity156 , which could not be crossed without reaching @entity0 's original destination on the opposite shore , the village of @entity160			2
author @entity6 says no bridge crossing existed			0
@entity6 says he interviewed a climber and others who confirmed a bridge was at that location before and after that period , but not at the time @entity0 was there			1
@entity0 's response : @entity0 insists he went to @entity146 over a narrow footbridge , and disputes @entity6 's assertions to the contrary			2
@entity0 has acknowledged that he spent only a few hours there , not days as was depicted in the book			1
@entity143 's promise to build a school : @entity2 : @entity0 promised the villagers of @entity146 that he would build them a school , after they nursed him back to health			1
that promise forever changed his life , and he dedicated himself to building schools in @entity181			0
the dispute : since @entity0 never went to @entity146 , he could n't have promised to build them a school			1
however , he did promise the villagers of @entity186 to the southeast that he would build them a school , but he reneged on that promise and instead built it in @entity146			0
a fundraising plea written by @entity0 in 1994 backs up the claim that he wanted to build the school in @entity186 , and it makes no mention of @entity146			2
@entity0 's response : @entity0 now says he visited both @entity146 and @entity186 villages during that 1993 trip , and promised the residents of both that he would build schools for them			0
he says he planned to first build the @entity186 school but then switched to @entity146 after finding a lack of local support and corruption in the first			0
@entity143 's kidnapping : @entity2 : @entity0 was kidnapped and held hostage by militants in the remote @entity61 region of @entity208			1
they took his passport and money , kept him under armed guard and monitored his every movement			0
he won his freedom after asking for a @entity215 and telling his captors that his wife was expecting a child			0
the dispute : people who were there described @entity0 as a guest in @entity208 , not a hostage			0
a photo shows him with his supposed captors , with @entity0 brandishing an @entity226			0
@entity0 's response : @entity0 stands by his story , though he says he regrets the unflattering descriptions of his captors in ' @entity2			1
' an attorney general 's investigation resulted in @entity0 reimbursing the organization more than $ 1.1million , removing him from any financial decisions and making wholesale changes to the organization 's leadership			1
@entity0 said he plans to eventually leave the organization			0
first , he wants to help raise contributions so they match expenses			0
then , he wants to see the graduation of the first wave of girls who entered @entity8 's schools built in @entity92 about a decade ago			1
he still is the highest - paid employee of @entity8 , drawing $ 169,000 in salaries and benefits last year			1
charity : @entity0 with local businesswomen in @entity247 , in @entity61 - where his charity worked to improve the quality of life for people there			1
however , the @entity5 report found that what school she @entity0 's foundation did build , many were repurposed or left without support if he left @entity8 , @entity0 said he would go on a long trip overseas before pursuing new projects advocating for girls ' education			1
he said he has been quietly helping groups working in @entity264 and @entity265			0
he also has not shelved his writing career			0
he said he has written enough during the past two years to have material for three books , all about empowering girls and women			0
but he said he is under pressure to write a book in response to @entity5 and @entity6			0
he said he wo n't do it			0
' some people like to make themselves look good by making others look bad			0
it 's not in my nature to make others look bad , ' he said .			0

@entity0 *co-wrote* the best - seller ' @entity2 '
three years ago , it was revealed that @entity0 made up several key points of the book and its sequel - including his ' capture ' in 1996 by the @entity59 which did n't exist in the country at that time
@entity0 was also *accused* of receiving an *excess* of funds raised for his charity , the @entity8
contributions to the charity have since plummeted from a high of $ 22million in 2010 to just $ 2.7million last year
now , @entity0 will return to promoting the charity in homes of raising donations for the *flailing* foundation
