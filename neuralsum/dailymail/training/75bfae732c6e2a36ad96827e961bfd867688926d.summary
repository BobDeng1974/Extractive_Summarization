these stunning photographs are not just colourful depictions of city life - they are also part of a visionary attempt to capture the passage of time in still images			1
artist @entity7 was keen to invent a way to show how scenes change over time , without resorting to a video camera or time - lapse photography			1
so he captured multiple pictures of the same sites over the course of a day , before splicing them together into a single image taken over several hours			1
the series is entitled ' time is a @entity19 ' , and aims to prove that skilled photography can show the passage of time just as easily as a video			1
innovative : these photographs show cityscapes pictured over the course of several hours and then spliced together to show the passage of time glow : the pictures were taken at sunrise and sunset , and mostly focus on a point of maximum light or maximum darkness surreal : the photographs are an innovative attempt to show the passage of time - the ' fourth dimension ' - using just the two dimensions of photography mr @entity7 was inspired by the way that photographs can summon up a three - dimensional scene even though they only have two dimensions themselves			1
so he started to think about how it would be possible to display time - sometimes called ' the fourth dimension ' - using only a static @entity51 picture			2
' most paintings and photographs are an instance of time , ' he said			2
' that 's not the way the world works			0
we experience a sequence of time , and that 's why a video is somehow more compelling than a freeze frame			2
' i work in the confines of a photographic print , because i like to do so			0
but in a way , i wanted to break out of this restriction of a single slice of time in photography			2
' @entity72 : landscapes around @entity74 which could be considered monotonous become glowingly colourful thanks to @entity7 's techniques dazzling : mr @entity7 's methods allow him to capture all the different phases of a sunrise or sunset in a single image @entity82 : some of the images capture more pastoral scenes bathed in a variety of coloured lights mr @entity7 , who works in @entity74 , said he regards video as an unsatisfactory replacement for photography , because it requires an electrically powered device to operate			1
the solution he hit upon involved taking a number of photos over a two - to four - hour period , usually during sunrise or sunset to get the greatest possible contrast in light within a single image			0
he then uses digital technology to cut the individual photographs together , creating composite images which usually centre on the point of maximum light or maximum darkness			0
standalone : mr @entity7 is able to show the passage of time without relying on electrically powered video equipment or blurry timelapse through the blinds : mr @entity112 creates slats of colour distributed across the face of his images seashore : mr @entity7 's images are particularly striking when they capture the sun moving across the face of the water the basic structure of a landscape is present in every piece , ' mr @entity7 said			1
' but each panel or concentric layer shows a different slice of time , which is related to the adjacent panel / layer			0
' the transition from daytime to night is gradual and noticeable in every piece , but would not be something you expect to see in a still image			0
' similarly , our experience of a scene is more than a snapshot			0
we often remember a sequence of events rather than a still frame full of details			0

@entity7 aims to show the passage of time in a still image by cutting together multiple photographs
