by @entity0 published : 07:27 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 10:17 est , 17 december 2012 thousands have claimed the most watched @entity2 for 20 years was tainted last night as they could not vote because the @entity4 's phone system crumbled			1
after a vintage year of sporting achievement for @entity6 , @entity9 winner and @entity10 gold medallist @entity7 won the prize with nearly a third of all the 1.6million votes			1
almost 500,000 backed the cyclist - more than the total number of people who voted last year			1
but some of the 14.5million viewers have complained they had to call 100 times to vote once or failed to get through at all			1
star : winner of @entity2 2012 , @entity7 , kisses the trophy after a landslide win - but thousands complained they could not vote instead they were forced to listen to an engaged tone or an error message			1
@entity7 492,064 ( 30.25 % ) 2			1

@entity37 28,626 ( 1.76 % ) 12			0
@entity38 10,342 ( 0.64 % ) total votes : 1,626,718 others complained the 35 - minute window for voting was far too short - which caused the logjam - and argued the format should have included text and online voting			1
one voter claimed he tried 100 times to vote for @entity29 but could not get through , while another claimed she tried 61 times to vote for @entity34			1
another said it took 12 attempts for her vote for @entity28 to register - although the problem calls probably would not have changed the result in the end			1
@entity60 tweeted : ' tried voting for @entity29			0
100 attempts but ca n't get through			2
' @ @entity63 tweeted : ' just tried voting for @entity2 & @entity64 announced network is too busy			0
they need more lines available			0
' @entity68 tweeted : ' what a joke , 1/2 hour to call vote for spoty and the lines are engaged			2
who decided on this method of voting , why not text ? ? ? ' @entity75 tweeted : " well that was ridiculous , voting lines only being open for 30 minutes			0
why could n't they have been open all show			0
' @entity81 tweeted : ' great show by @entity4 - but telephone voting failed			1
did n't get through once in 30 mins ' while @entity84 said : ' if the voting just closed , how did they get a trophy to @entity88 and tee up @entity29 and @entity89 ? bit odd			0
' anger : just one of the examples of the thousands frustrated because they could not get through pressure : as more than 1.6 million voted the @entity4 system creaked because of the volume of calls but the @entity4 played down any problems today			1
' we have had confirmation by the network operators that there were no reported problems with the telephone system , ' a corporation spokesman said			2
' any issues around not being able to get through to the telephone numbers may have resulted from temporary congestion caused by the unusual number of callers dialling the same number at the same time			1
any issues should have been temporary and resolved by redialling soon after			2
' the 14.5 million viewers last night made it the most successful sports personality for at least 20 years			1
celebrated : the @entity115 ( right ) and runner up @entity28 during the @entity116 last night crowning moment : @entity115 hands over the famous trophy to @entity7 one in three people watching tv tuned in and it had an an average audience of 10.6 million viewers			1
as mr @entity7 received the prestigious award from the @entity115 at 10.30pm 14.5million watched			1
last year the show was panned after it was moved to a thursday night where only 4.3million saw it			0
the previous record was in 2003 when @entity128 had won the rugby world cup but that was still only 8.3million			0
@entity131 : @entity133 drinks in the acclaim as @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity28 and the @entity115 all cheer him on			0

many tried to vote up to 100 times but got an engaged tone , error message or could not get through at all
@entity4 phone line crumbled as sports personality 2012 was the most watched for two decades
14.5m tuned in and 1.6m voted as @entity7 took the top prize
the cyclist received almost 500,000 votes - more than the total number who voted in 2011
@entity4 say there was no problem with their phone system - only ' temporary congestion '
