by @entity0 the 12 - year - old girl who was mauled by a raccoon as a baby is back at home after successfully undergoing surgery to create a new ear			1
@entity8 of @entity9 , @entity7 was just three - months - old in 2002 when her young parents left her at home with the pet and she lost her right ear , nose and part of her lip in an attack			1
two years ago , doctor @entity17 repaired little @entity19 's nose and now he 's focusing on giving her a new ear			1
going home : @entity8 , 12 , of @entity9 , @entity7 was released from the hospital monday after undergoing a seven - hour surgery to implant cartilage into her arm @entity26 surgery : the lung cartilage was molded into the shape of an ear and inserted into @entity19 's arm during the april 15 surgery growing : the cartilage will continue to grow in her arm for the next few months before doctors will attach it to her ear			1
pictured above on monday one last surgery : little @entity19 will return to the hospital in june for her surgery , which will hopefully be her last			2
pictured above on monday ' the raccoon pretty much ate the right side of her face , all the way back to the ear , ' @entity43 € ™ s adoptive mom @entity42 told @entity49			2
' now , all she wants is to wear two earrings			0
' that dream of pierced ears came closer to reality on april 15 , when she underwent a seven - hour surgery to embed lung cartilage , shaped into an ear lobe , into her arm where it will continue to grow until june			1
that 's when @entity19 will go under the knife for hopefully the last time as dr @entity61 attaches the cartilage to her ear			1
brave : @entity8 was just three months old when a raccoon chewed off her nose , ear and lips			1
pictured above just before she underwent the surgery on april 15 but this last procedure will be the most complex yet , as it is claimed it has only been performed twice before			1
[ dr @entity17 admitted the procedure is not easy and he will only have one chance to get it right , so he has been practicing on a potato			2
dr @entity17 , of @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity7 , told @entity76 : ' as plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit - what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her			1
' i 've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template			0
' mauled : @entity19 @entity90 as a baby before and after the attack			2
her adopted parents say she is still a happy girl he said he could not guarantee success , but would try his best			0
@entity19 's adopted mother @entity42 said people from as far as @entity99 and @entity100 had contacted the family to tell them what an inspiration the girl has been			0
she was just a newborn when her 18 - year - old mother and 23 - year - old father left her home alone with the pet			2
the raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left open when food had been dropped in , and no one was there to save the baby when she was attacked			0
her great - aunt @entity42 and great - uncle @entity115 only found out about the attack with horror when they watched that night 's news bulletin			0
they gained custody of @entity19 and her brother @entity122 , who was then 15 months old , and they and their friends raised more than $ 10,000 to help pay for her trips in and out of hospital			0
@entity42 had to quit her job at a daycare center to look after @entity19 after doctors said she would need full time care			0
although ears have been made out of ribs before , the method of ' growing ' the ear inside the forearm is extremely rare			0
remarkable : @entity19 with her adopted mother @entity42 and dr @entity139 after he built her a new nose in a 2012 operation			1
he said this next surgery will hopefully be the last major work she has done attack : it has been a slow recovery for @entity19 , who lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose intact : @entity19 as a baby with her brother @entity122 before she was attacked in late 2002 happy family : @entity19 now lives with ( from left ) her great - uncle @entity115 , great - aunt @entity42 and brother @entity122 it has to be done because @entity19 's ear was so badly damaged that the foundations of an ear structure no longer exist inside her head			1
@entity19 previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable			0
yet despite the enormous damage , there is one miracle			0
even before the extensive surgery which will grant her a new quality of life , @entity19 's hearing has been largely unaffected .			0

@entity8 from @entity9 , @entity7 , left *disfigured* by 2002 attack
on april 15 , she underwent *radical* surgery to implant lung cartilage in her arm where it will grow until it can be attached to her ear
the surgery to attach the ear in june will be conducted by dr @entity139 , is same plastic surgeon who gave her a new nose
