@entity1 's controversial appointment as a tourism ambassador for @entity3 has been defended by legendary musician @entity4			1
the 24 - year - old singer faced a huge backlash after being installed as the @entity7 for @entity3 in october after it was revealed she has only been living in the city for little more than 12 months			1
critics dismissed her suitability for the role , questioning how much she knew about the city given that she was born in @entity13 and launched her career in @entity15			1
@entity4 , pictured with his daughter @entity16 , is a @entity3 and was born in the @entity17 but long - time @entity3 @entity4 , who was born in @entity17 , grew up in @entity18 and now owns a house in @entity20 near @entity21 , said that the city 's residents should ' let her in '			1
the 65 - year - old said : ' i see the @entity26 going , " @entity1 is going to be the new @entity3 representative ? '' the singer told @entity29			1
that 's what @entity3 is all about			1
i say , ' welcome '			0
' @entity4 also praised @entity1 's songwriting talents			1
' she catches a lot of junk , maybe because she 's so popular with young girls			1
but i like what she 's projecting			0
i respect what she 's doing			0
' @entity41 heart @entity3 : @entity1 , pictured enjoying the sights in august , is a passionate @entity3 fan it was last month that @entity44 announced she had been appointed as an ambassador for the city during an episode of @entity48			1
she said at the time : ' i 'm still learning , but i 'm so enthusiastic about this city that when i love something , i 'm very vocal about it			0
' @entity3 was a huge landscape for what became this album			1
it 's affected my life in ways i 'm not even aware of fully			0
' the singer , who recently bought a £ 12million apartment in the trendy @entity61 area , also penned a song called welcome to @entity3 , which provided the opening track to her new album , 1989			1
giving the thumbs up : @entity1 is excited about her new role as @entity3 's global welcome ambassador she added : ' i started the album with @entity69 to @entity3 because @entity3 has been an important landscape and location for the story of my life in the last couple of years			1
' it 's like an electric city , and i approached moving there with such wide - eyed optimism			2
i saw @entity3 as a place of endless potential and possibilities , and you can hear that reflected in this music and in this song			2
' as part of her role , the singer presented a series of videos for @entity3 's official tourism agency , @entity90 , including one in which the singer explains some common slang words , such as ' stoop ' ( commonly known as a porch ) and ' bodega ' , the 24 - hour corner shops which sell ' almost anything '			1
the singer grew up in @entity18 and now owns a house in @entity20 near @entity21 , has defended @entity1 's appointment as ambassador for @entity3 ' a lot of heart ' : the singer explains that @entity3 are friendly to tourists and the city is easy to get around in another video , she assures visitors that in @entity3 , ' people are very friendly and there 's also a lot of heart here			1
and it 's easy to get around			0
people will help you if you ask for help			0
' but the move provoked a furious reaction from @entity3 were shocked that she was selected to represent the city			2
head of tourism : @entity121 is ceo of @entity122 ' i 'm incensed ! it 's insulting , ' said @entity125 singer @entity125 , who was born in @entity126			1
he told the @entity128 : ' she does n't have any life experience here , or connection to the town			0
' there 's so many others — @entity138 , for instance , if you want a big name , ' @entity125 added			0
' but @entity1 is the pop culture queen , so she moves into town , and she 's the ambassador			0
' the @entity141 page was flooded with negative responses			0
' @entity1 has nothing to do with @entity3 , she is a bad representation			2
get a real @entity145 instead , ' commented @entity146			0
' seems like a truly ridiculous ambassador , ' wrote another poster , @entity149			0
but @entity150 stood by their decision , saying : ' we could n't have asked for a better synergy between @entity1 and @entity122 to tell our story about what makes @entity3 , @entity3			2
' ' this is a campaign targeting visitors to @entity3 rather than locals , ' they told @entity161			2
' there 's a separate campaign encouraging locals to explore their own city that celebrates the views of locals			0
' ' what makes @entity3 @entity3 is that it is unlike anywhere else in the world			2
' it 's almost like this city has its own heartbeat			0
you can find fashion that inspires you , art that inspires you , humanity that inspires you			0
it 's impossible not to fall in love or be affected by something in @entity3			1
' i think what brought me to @entity3 is still a little bit of a mystery to me			2
' every day i would wake up with this feeling , like i need to be in @entity3			2
it pulled me here like a magnet			0
' i was intimidated by the fact that it was bright and bold and loud , and now i know that i should run towards things like that			0
' i should run towards things that are absolutely overwhelmingly electric			0
' there 's so much happening right in front of me , so many stories playing out that for my writing it definitely helped inspire an album that is by far the most proud of in my career			0
' the head of @entity3 tourism also waded into the row , saying the pop star was a suitable choice given that it is a ' city of immigrants '			1
@entity121 , president and ceo of @entity122 , the official marketing and tourism organisation for the @entity3 , said that @entity1 was chosen because of her newcomer status , not in spite of it			2
' @entity3 is a city of immigrants , not many of us were born in @entity3 – we 've all followed our dreams there			1
' @entity121 revealed that @entity1 's new role came about after he met her manager by chance , which led to an invitation to the singer 's recently - purchased apartment , where he first listened to her song dedicated to @entity3			1
' @entity1 's song @entity69 is written from the perspective of a newcomer , that starry - eyed optimism and overwhelming energy you feel when you first come to @entity3 , and she wanted to share that , ' @entity121 added			1
' it 's like we wrote it for our own brand , ' he said , adding that @entity1 's reach on social media and her ' authentic ' engagement with her huge following is something that money ca n't buy .			0
