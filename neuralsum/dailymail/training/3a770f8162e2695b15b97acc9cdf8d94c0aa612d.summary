almost a year since her victory she has n’t released an album or been on tour – calling into question the credibility of a programme that boasts it is a springboard for musical success			1
members of the former holiday camp entertainer ’s management team told the @entity40 she appears to be a reluctant star who has refused to co-operate with publicity opportunities to boost her profile and failed to work as hard as @entity10 runners up @entity44 and @entity45			2
no impact : miss @entity12 , who still lives in a semi-detached bungalow in @entity27 , @entity28 , failed to enter the top 40 with her first single a source said : ‘ @entity12 is wary of fame and does n’t aspire to be a massive star			1

’ miss @entity12 ’s only release to date , a cover of @entity76 by @entity77 , was a flop , selling just 7,000 copies last june and reaching number 45 in the charts			1
