a @entity4 ‘ super spud ’ claimed by scientists to be healthier to eat , cheaper to grow and better for the environment could be field tested in @entity2 next year			1
but plans for the trials were condemned last night by critics who argue that genetically modifying crops to create ‘ frankenfoods ’ could threaten natural ecosystems and human health			1
scientists at the publicly funded @entity14 in @entity15 are hoping to develop the potato using eight genes from other varieties			1
scientists claim to have be close to engineering a @entity4 ‘ super spud ’ which is healthier to eat , cheaper to grow and better for the environment			1
a stock image of non @entity4 potatoes is pictured they claim this will reduce the risk of potentially harmful acrylamide chemicals forming when potatoes are fried – a problem that has been linked to cancer			2
the added genes will also protect against potato blight , which costs @entity2 farmers £ 60million a year in losses and use of fungicides , and nematode worms			1
professor @entity36 , who is leading the project and is already in negotiations with the @entity40 firm @entity39 to commercialise the potato , said @entity4 technology is the only way to achieve such results			2
but field trials , which the scientists hope to begin in 12 months ’ time , will first have to be approved under tough @entity49 regulations and are likely to attract protesters , requiring them to be conducted behind high fences			1
anti-gm groups said last night the project was a waste of taxpayers ’ money and even if the scientists ’ claims were proven , consumers would never want to buy the resulting food			0
critics say that tampering with the genes in crops to create ‘ frankenstein foods ’ could damage natural ecosystems			2
a stock image of a protester is shown professor @entity36 and his team have previously developed a potato which , after three years of trials , was shown to ward off blight and increase yields			2
they sold the results of that research to @entity39 and are looking to develop the idea by introducing further genes			0
@entity78 , of the @entity79 , said : ‘ a previous @entity4 potato , launched in 2009 , was claimed to be the answer to the blight disease common in the @entity2 potato crop			1
‘ now we ’re told that wo n’t work , and a @entity4 potato needs up to eight different @entity4 characteristics to be useful			1
‘ as with other @entity4 research , this is a complete waste of time , money and scientific expertise			1
’ @entity93 , of the campaign group @entity94 , said : ‘ @entity95 is very good at evolving – this might just force a faster evolution of the disease			0
’ although there have been field trials in the past , no @entity4 food has ever been commercially grown in @entity2 because of @entity103 regulations that make it difficult to get licences			1
it means that although @entity2 researchers are leading the way in developing @entity4 technology , the end results are usually snapped up by foreign firms			1
professor @entity36 said @entity4 ‘ has been shown to be safe ’ , and before the potato could be sold , it would need extensive testing and authorisation from @entity49 bodies such as the @entity116			1
he added : ‘ some people have concerns about us partnering with industry , but as research scientists we … need commercial partners if the public are to gain the benefits of our research			0
’ professor @entity36 , who is leading the project said the new potato ‘ aims to be better for the environment , reduce production costs , reduce waste and also be healthier ’			1
he hopes to conduct field trials in just 12 months time			1
a stock image of a field of potatoes is shown suspicious research : professor @entity136 , who authored a study claiming @entity4 gives you cancer , is backed by a homeopathy group the myth : food that has been genetically modified may be harmful to humans			2
and that does n’t include many more made with milk or meat from animals given @entity4 feed			0
there has yet to be one case of any ill - effect			0
the myth : trials show @entity4 feed may cause cancer or stomach problems in animals			2
the truth : the author behind the ‘ bogus ’ research fuelling this claim , prof @entity136 , is closely linked to and funded by leading members of a homeopathy group which believes bone cancer can be cured with water and minute quantities of magnesium			0
the research has been attacked by every major scientific institution in the field , including the @entity169			0
the myth : @entity4 strains will cross-pollinate and so ‘ contaminate ’ other crops and man will have irrecoverably interfered with the stuff of life			2
others like potatoes are cultivated via tubers , so pollen is not an issue for them either			0
as for rice , it ’s also mostly self - pollinating			0
the myth : organic food is safer			0
the truth : the @entity169 says there ’s no evidence – and furthermore , germs from manure create risks of their own : an e. coli outbreak in organic beansprouts in @entity193 killed 50 people in 2011 and last month in the @entity40 100 people contracted the serious liver disease hepatitis a from organic berry yohurt			0
the myth : @entity4 will lead to a stranglehold by multinationals like @entity201			0
the truth : many @entity4 crops have been developed by universities and are not patented			0
the full cost of developing @entity206 , which will remedy the vitamin a deficiency which kills and blinds millions of children per year , is being met by the charitable project behind it .			0

@entity2 team has agreed *government* funding to develop a @entity4 potato
it will have beneficial genes from other varieties to make the perfect crop
super potato ' aims to be better for the environment , reduce production costs , reduce waste and also be healthier , ' researcher says
@entity15 - based team hopes to conduct first field trials in 12 months ’ time
critics say taxpayer should *n't* be funding development of ' frankenfoods '
