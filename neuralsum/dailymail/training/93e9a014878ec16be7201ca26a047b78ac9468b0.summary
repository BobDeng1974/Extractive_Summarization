by @entity0 last updated at 7:38 am on 16th february 2012 a new robot from @entity2 is a metal ' avatar ' that is controlled via a virtual reality suit - letting users remote - control the robot and see through its eyes			1
the @entity10 mimics the movements of its pilot - and is so realistic it can even pick up objects			1
scientists hope similar robots could venture into dangerous areas such as contaminated reactors			0
the controller dons a @entity20 head display that covers his whole vision and can ' see ' through a robot 's eyes			1
wheenever he moves sensors replicate that movement on the robot			1
it can also feel the shape of something as small as a lego brick - with corresponding impulses being sent back to the controller			1
the robot ’s makers believe it could be extremely useful in situation like the @entity65 disaster when radiation levels are too deadly for humans and the current wheeled robots are not responsive enough			1
it could also have applications for bomb disposal , space exploration or for surgery. , the @entity10 has been developed by @entity2 researchers at @entity75 and has been made as life - like as possible			2
it has eight joints on its neck and seven on its arms , like like humans do			0
pressure simulators within the control suit 's gloves allow the ' driver ' to feel what the robot is touching the pilot simply moves their arms fingers and head to pilot @entity10 the screen on the top right shows what the ' pilot ' is seeing through her @entity97 helmet - the same pink teddy that is directly in front of the robot , bottom right the body can also move in seven different directions and it has video cameras in its head that are linked up to the 3d head display so the user can ‘ see ’ what it is looking at			1
sensory data is sent back via gloves fitted with semiconductors and motors which mimic touch , pressure , texture , heat and cold			0
@entity118 of the @entity10 team said the aim was to ‘ make it really feel as if you are in another place ’			2
he said : ‘ what you can do with this telexistence robot is you can see things you normally see , even in a remote location			2
‘ if you are a physician , for example , to examine a patient you need to extend your hands			2
‘ with this system you have hands that you can move just like your own			0
‘ you can also hear what ’s going on around you			0
those are the first things that we achieved with this system			0
‘ now we have added sensors that communicate what the robot ’s fingers are touching and a system to feed the touch sensation back to the operator			0
‘ the technology makes it possible to operate the robot as your avatar and feel what you are touching , even if you are a long distance away			1
’ @entity151 @entity150 of @entity75 ’s graduate school of media and design added that the research could allow humans to go into areas that are too dangerous for them but ‘ require human skills ’ .			0

suit lets ' pilot ' see through robot eyes and feel with its hands
@entity97 - controlled robot could be used in @entity65 - style disasters
robot controls are so *sensitive* it can pick up objects
