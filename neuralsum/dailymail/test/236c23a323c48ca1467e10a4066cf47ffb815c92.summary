thursday 's commemoration in @entity9 , @entity10 , included a reenactment of @entity1 's last clash with @entity3 's troops and of the @entity2 surrender in a @entity10 farmhouse on april 9 , 1865			1
ahead of the battle reenactment , the boys of the @entity2 11th @entity10 were a seemingly pretty cool bunch as those portraying @entity4 troops gathered several fields away at @entity22 amid the rolling farm country dotted by neat brick buildings and white picket fences			1
in april 1865 , however , the troops were n't as calm			2
@entity1 's forces were in a state of growing disarray in the hours before @entity1 formally called it quits			2

@entity1 's forces , seeking an escape route , had crossed the @entity63 while burning bridges			2
union forces ' attacked them vigorously ' in the hours before the official surrender , convincing @entity1 the fight was over			1
the last days accounts were cited as saying ' the road for miles was strewn with broken down wagons , caissons , and baggage of all kinds , presenting a scene seldom witnessed on the part of @entity1 's army			2
' but in 2015 , a stoic @entity78 could n't contain his excitement when asked about his role in the 150th commemoration of @entity1 's surrender here , effectively ending the @entity7 150 years ago on thursday			1
' this is an awesome place to be , ' said @entity78 , a @entity85 resident			0
' we 're all excited to be here			0
' the @entity2 re-enactors were a ragtag , mismatched group of heavy wool coats , ill - fitting trousers and more types of hats than a haberdashery			1
dozens stood along a rough wooden fence , their muskets stacked at the ready			0
@entity99 @entity7 re-enactors portraying @entity2 artillery fire several of their cannons during the re-enactment @entity2 artillery re-enactors appear to work in threes to fire off each cannon			1

the outline of @entity4 troops in formation could be seen in fields as visitors approached the park			2
@entity153 of @entity154 , a re-enactor with the @entity118 28th from @entity154 , explained the strategy succinctly : ' we 're trying to break through the @entity4 lines			2
' @entity158 , a park ranger on loan from @entity160 to @entity9 , went down the line of re-enactors for a quick briefing before battle			2
' this is part of what i like to call the armistice that was signed on april 9 , when gen. @entity1 surrendered the @entity42 , ' he said			1
in a place where historically accurate fashions abound , the @entity170 of @entity171 stood out			0
cousins by marriage , @entity174 and @entity175 carefully stepped through soaked turf and muddy roads at @entity9 to keep their hoop skirts mud - free			2
the two also wore bonnets as they watched @entity4 and @entity2 reenactors clash			1

the re-enactors spent the night camping in tents at the @entity202 amid the hundreds if not thousands lined along a fence watching a battle re-enactment , the two women drew attention as they posed for photographs			0
' it just enhances the experience for us , ' @entity208 said amid the startling booms of cannon fire and the crackle of muzzle fire			0
' it makes it more alive			0
' it 's an important part of history that we need to remember			0
' ' we 're just having fun , ' @entity175 added			0
asked if the reproduction outfit had hampered her travels , @entity175 said , ' well , it is muddy			0
' she modestly lifted the hem of her hoop skirt , revealing laced black boots that were slightly muddied			0
@entity175 's husband @entity228 joined the two wearing a formal waist jacket and coachman 's hat			0
he finished off the look with a cravat			0
the @entity170 have been to other @entity7 commemorative events , but @entity9 was the first in period costumes			1
' this is a big deal , ' @entity175 said , adding ' we wo n't be around for the 200th			0
