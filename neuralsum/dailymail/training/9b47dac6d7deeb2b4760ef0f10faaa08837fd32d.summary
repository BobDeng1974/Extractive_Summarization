by @entity0 published : 00:00 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 13:02 est , 25 february 2013 for the first time in decades , the @entity1 is making steady gains in the number of high school students earning diplomas , putting it on pace to reach a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020 , according to a new analysis released monday			1
but the good news comes with a big asterisk : students with learning disabilities and limited fluency in @entity16 face long odds to finish high school , with graduation rates for those groups as low as 25 percent in some states , the analysis found			1
minority students also continue to fall well behind their white peers , with about one - third of @entity25 students and 29 percent of @entity27 students dropping out before graduation			1
for the first time in decades , the @entity1 is making steady gains in the number of high school students earning diplomas , putting it on pace to reach a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020 the ' building a @entity34 ' report - which was co-authored by @entity35 , a leading scholar of dropout rates at @entity38 - found strong improvements in graduation rates in a diverse collection of states including @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
the national graduation rate jumped from 71.7 percent in 2001 to 78.2 percent in 2010 , with the pace of improvement accelerating in the past few years			2
' for the first time in 40 years , we have seen significant , sustained improvement , ' said @entity54 , a co-author of the study and the chief executive of @entity57 , a public policy group in @entity59 @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 lead the nation with graduation rates close to 90 percent , according to the report , which used data from 2010 and 2011			1
at the bottom of the heap : @entity69 and @entity70 , where barely six in 10 high school freshmen can expect to earn a diploma within four years			0
@entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 did n't use the same formula for calculating rates as other states and thus were not included in the report			0
' increasing the graduation rate has to be a purposeful exercise , something you 're driven to do every day , ' said @entity83 , superintendent of public schools in @entity85 , @entity46 , where the graduation rate has jumped from 64.3 percent to 78.5 percent since 2007			0
' more and more , you 're seeing people across the country get it			0
' yet the report 's authors warn that the momentum could still stall			0
nearly every state will soon be rolling out curricula tied to the @entity96 standards , which aim to bring more rigor to math and language arts instruction			0
many will require students to pass exams tied to those higher standards to graduate , which could push lead to more failures and higher drop - out rates , the report suggests			2
minority students continue to fall well behind their white peers , with about one - third of @entity25 students and 29 percent of @entity27 students dropping out before graduation the authors also warn that some states , such as @entity74 , @entity70 and @entity115 , plan to grade high schools in large measure by student test scores and participation in advanced courses , with the graduation rate accounting for less than 20 percent of the school 's grade			1
that could give principals an incentive to push out failing students and focus on high - achievers , rather than helping the stragglers work toward their diplomas			0
another concern : some states , such as @entity46 , do not count students as dropouts if they say they are leaving to be home - schooled or to transfer to a private school			2
the report notes that thousands of those students are significantly behind in credits and suggests that many may be dropping out without admitting it			0
perhaps the biggest threat to momentum , however , is the lagging performance of disadvantaged students , the report 's authors said			0
in @entity69 , for instance , just 23 percent of students with disabilities , 29 percent of those with limited @entity16 skills and 43 percent of @entity25 students earned their diplomas in 2011			1
even generally high - performing states such @entity62 , @entity153 and @entity154 have strikingly poor records with some minority students			1
@entity157 has the biggest gaps : the graduation rate for @entity25 and @entity27 students hovered around 50 percent in 2011 , compared to 84 percent for white students			1
' we need to look at these disparities head on , ' said @entity163 , @entity157 's education commissioner			0
@entity157 governor @entity165 , a @entity166 , has proposed $ 640 million in new education funding , including an effort to better integrate schools in hopes of boosting performance for minority students , @entity163 said			2
elsewhere , state officials plan to bring down the dropout rate by fundamentally rethinking the way school works			0
in @entity178 , where the graduation rate was 68 percent in 2011 , chief education officer @entity177 aims to stop measuring student progress by credit hours and start focusing on how kids can demonstrate mastery of key concepts - whether or not they 've sat through a full year of classes			2
the state 's graduation rate - and the poor performance of minority students - ' is untenable , unsustainable , and frankly highly dangerous , ' weakening the economy by leaving so many students unprepared for college or career , @entity177 said .			1

study shows graduation rates are *climbing* for first time in decades
but minority students are still falling behind peers with one - third of @entity25 students as well as 29 percent of @entity27 students dropping out before graduation
graduation rates among students with learning disabilities are as low as 25 percent in some states
