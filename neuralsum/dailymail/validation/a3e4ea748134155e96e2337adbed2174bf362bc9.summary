ever wondered what the football world would be like without @entity2 and @entity3 ? well naturally we 'd miss their stunning goals and dazzling trickery , but it seems erasing them would shake up the order of things in @entity12			0
stats gurus @entity14 have calculated what the @entity16 table would look like if the goals of the divine duo were taken away - and there 's quite a dramatic change at the top			2
@entity16 would look very different if the goals of @entity3 and @entity2 were taken away the deadly duo have scored 57 goals between them in @entity16 alone this season - @entity3 30 , @entity2 27 @entity27 currently enjoy a two - point advantage over their rivals @entity29 in the @entity16 standings how the @entity16 table would look if goals by @entity3 and @entity2 were taken away ( @entity14 ) in real life , @entity27 currently enjoy a two - point advantage over their @entity35 rivals , thanks in no small part to the 30 league goals of @entity3 this season			1
but if they and @entity2 's contribution of 27 goals were subtracted , it 's @entity29 who would enjoy a slender one - point advantage at the summit			1
@entity14 went through every match this season in which @entity2 and @entity3 have scored and took away their goals from the final score			0
@entity3 celebrates his goal in @entity27 's 1 - 1 home draw with @entity52 at the weekend the @entity53 was also on target in @entity27 's 2 - 0 victory at @entity56 last month @entity3 celebrates one of his hat - trick of goals in @entity27 's 3 - 0 home win over @entity61 in december with @entity2 , @entity29 would still win all but one of the matches in which he has scored			1
that is the 3 - 2 home win over @entity52 last month , which would end in a draw			0
but taking away @entity3 's goals affects @entity27 's season more dramatically			2
the @entity53 scored four in the 5 - 1 home win over @entity56 , meaning they would only draw 1 - 1			0
@entity2 claims the match ball after his hat - trick in @entity29 's 5 - 1 rout of neighbours @entity73 @entity2 's 27 league goals this season have seen him surpass the all - time @entity16 scoring record @entity2 celebrates with team - mates @entity77 and @entity79 after scoring in the 5 - 0 rout of @entity81 last month removing his hat - trick against @entity61 would see them claim one point rather than three , and subtracting his goal against @entity52 last weekend means they would lose instead of draw			1
it does prove to an extent that @entity27 are more reliant on the goals of @entity3 than @entity29 are on the goals of @entity2			0
but in such a nip and tuck title race , who 's to say that wo n't change again by the end of the season			0
@entity3 's @entity16 goals 2014 - 15 @entity2 's @entity16 goals 2014 - 15			1

@entity3 has 30 @entity16 goals this season , @entity2 27
while real table shows @entity27 with a two - point lead over @entity29
removing the duo 's goals would give @entity29 a one - point advantage , regardless of @entity2 's 27 goal *influence*
