by @entity0 this is the incredible moment that a mystery group of parachutists launched themselves off the top of a church spire - and landed in a market place just 210ft below			1
the five daredevils , some of whom came from as far as @entity10 , jumped from the spire at @entity12 , @entity13 , after weeks of planning the elaborate stunt			1
and the jumpers - who have all been jumping for at least five years - even used cameras to film the scene as they plunged down to the square below in the middle of the night			1
the acronym stands for building , antenna , span and earth - the four places from which a base jumper can leap			1
as with the more traditional jumps , the participant uses a parachute to break their fall			0
police have criticised the ' dangerous ' jump and have now launched an investigation			1
but one of the parachutists , who did not want to give his name , said the group spent two weeks analysing the area to ensure they jumped at a safe time			2
he said : ' this was base jumping at its most difficult because the height was very low and it was very technical			1
the five jumpers said they spent two weeks analysing the town , including what time the pubs closed , to ensure the jump took place at the safest time the jumpers filmed the move - which took place in the middle of the night - on hand - held and helmet - mounted cameras one of the jumpers , who has not been named , said the view from the top of the spire , looking down onto the market place , was ' fantastic ' the 200ft jump was said to be on the of most technical base jumps - which involves jumping off a static object - because of the low height of the spire the phrase base jumping was coined by a filmmaker @entity75 - often seen as the father of base jumping - in 1978 , when he filmed himself doing a jump in @entity79 , @entity80			1
the acronym stands for building , antenna , span and earth - the four places from which a base jumper can leap			1
once a person has made a jump from each of the four categories , they can apply to have a base jump number , which are awarded in sequence			1
the first people to be awarded a base number were @entity97 and @entity98 , who jumped together from a @entity100 skyscraper on 18 january 1981			1
as of march 2014 , more than 1,700 base numbers have been issues			2
the world record for the highest base jump was recorded in april this year			1
@entity105 and @entity106 jumped 2,717ft from the @entity107 in @entity108			2
other people had previously jumped from the building , but the duo jumped from a 500m platform to enable them to break the record			2
@entity115 competitions , where the jumps are based on landing accuracy , have been held since the early 1980s			2
the heights of the jumps vary between competitions , but a recent competition involved participants jumping from the 1,483ft high @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124			2
' we ’ve all been jumping for five or more years			2
we all come from experienced skydive backgrounds and lots of us also having climbing or mountaineering experience			0
' we spent two weeks visiting , studying the movements of the town centre itself , what times the pubs closed , wind directions and studying turbulence around the tower			0
' with the spire just 210ft from the ground , the parachutists had very little time to erect their parachute - making it an extremely challenging jump			1
but the unnamed man said the jumpers were determined to complete the stunt because the spire is ' unique '			2
so when they heard the spire was surrounded by scaffolding , as part of work being done to replace a weather vane , they decided to start arranging the jump			1
the man said : ' we have military laser range - finding equipment so we know how high something is and the distance we ’ve got to fly to get to safety			0
' it does get very scientific and it takes hours and hours of planning			0
we were mindful not to do any damage to the fabric of the church			0
' we are the first people ever to do it and for us that was part of the attraction because it was a unique object to jump from			0
it was spectacular up there and the view of the town was fantastic			0
' inspector @entity177 , from @entity12 police , said the force had received calls about people being seen parachuting near the church			1
he said : ' obviously this is very dangerous and we strongly advise people not to do it			0
' it ’s also trespassing on church property , which is potentially going to cause damage to the church			0
the jumpers say they are the first people to complete the jump			0
they said they wanted to jump from the spire because it is a ' unique object ' the parachutists were seen landed in the market square directly below the spire			1
it is one of the most technically - difficult base jumps , according to one of the team base jumping , regarded by many as an extreme sport , involves participants leaping from a fixed object , rather than planes			1
it stands for building , atenna , span and earth , indicating the four places from which the person can jump ' it ’s likely those who have done this are very experienced and if people think they can do something similar and come away unharmed that ’s very unlikely			0
' people should n’t try this			0
it is dangerous and could result in serious injury			0
' according to an online ‘ base fatality list ’ , 228 people have died doing base jumping since 1981			1
churchwarden @entity230 said : ‘ it ’s disappointing they have trespassed on church property			0
' although they have n’t done any harm , it could encourage others to climb the scaffolding			0
we are obviously concerned and not very happy about it			0
' work is now being carried out to make the scaffolding more secure , he said .			0

@entity245 jumped from a parish church spire in @entity12 , @entity13
they used hand - held cameras to film themselves doing the 200ft jump
the film shows base jumping at its hardest because of the low height
police said the move was ' dangerous ' and have launched investigation
