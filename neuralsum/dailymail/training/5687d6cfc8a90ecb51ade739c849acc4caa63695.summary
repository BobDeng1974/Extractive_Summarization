by @entity0 whistleblower : @entity3 constable @entity2 , who described how ' massaging ' crime figures was common practice police are failing to properly record crimes as serious as rape to hit performance targets , a damning report has revealed			1
a target culture within policing has created ‘ perverse incentives ’ and driven officers up to the most senior level to ‘ misrecord ’ crime , mps said			1
the public administration select committee called for local @entity19 to abolish all targets to help restore public trust in crime figures			2
they also called for an investigation into treatment of a police officer who blew the whistle on corrupt recording practices			1
former metropolitan police officer @entity2 described how massaging numbers to hit targets had become ‘ an ingrained part of policing culture ’			1
he exposed how crimes were routinely downgraded , with robberies logged as theft and burglary reclassified as criminal damage – or even ‘ no - crimed ’ – to make them ‘ disappear in a puff of smoke ’			1
he resigned last month after an investigation into misconduct was launched			0
the report was published as a new @entity45 poll for @entity46 found 40 per cent of @entity47 think crime has gone up in the last decade			0
this is despite police figures and the national crime survey showing sharp falls in crime levels			2
@entity54 , the committee chairman , said it was ‘ depressing ’ how the officer was treated by the @entity3 and claimed most forces were ‘ still in denial about the damage targets cause , both to data integrity and to standards of behaviour ’			0
the report found crime figures recorded by the police vastly exaggerated the extent of genuine decreases in recent years			2
national targets for crime figures have been abolished by the @entity71			0
but the report found targets , and a target culture , remained at a local level , set by @entity19 or senior officers			2
most national targets for crime statistics have been completely abolished by the @entity71 , but they still remain at a local level , set by @entity19 these , it said , ‘ drive perverse incentives to misrecord crime , tend to affect attitudes and erode data quality ’			1
it went on to warn : ‘ the attitudes and behaviour which lead to the misrecording of crime have become ingrained			0
’ in particular , the report pointed to ‘ strong evidence ’ that sex crimes such as rape were under - recorded in many areas , with mps concluding that officers were failing to comply with national crime recording rules			0
the report also found ministers and statisticians have been ‘ too passive ’ in failing to confront concerns over the quality of police statistics			1
@entity101 , director of the @entity102 , said : ‘ it ’s encouraging that this issue is being investigated by @entity105 but the findings are damning			0
‘ there should really be only one way the police make crime figures look better : by catching more criminals and bringing them to justice			1
anything else is fiddling the figures			0
’ @entity116 police minister @entity115 said the credibility of the government ’s crime statistics now ‘ lies in tatters ’			1
earlier this year , police crime figures were stripped of their national kitemark by the statistics watchdog – official recognition of the fact they could no longer be trusted			2
however chief constable @entity127 , chief executive of the @entity128 , pointed to the new @entity129 for officers			0
he said : ‘ in terms of crime recording , the code specifically highlights the importance of accurate and honest record - keeping			0

@entity138 culture within the police called ' perverse '
@entity141 @entity2 said massaging numbers was ' part of policing '
the whistleblower exposed how crimes were routinely downgraded
the crimes were *demoted* to make the statistics ' disappear '
