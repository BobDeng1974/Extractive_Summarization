@entity49 , @entity40 , recommends using it for five to six minutes to achieve a machine - quality wash but it can be used for just 30 seconds for light loads mr @entity40 , 34 , from @entity53 , @entity54 , said : ‘ i came up with concept for the @entity13 wash bag in the lead up to a six week trip to @entity42			1
‘ my mate and i were both taking tents , sleeping bags , sleeping mats and cold weather gear , and we only had enough room in our packs for a couple of days worth of clothes			0
‘ this would mean doing laundry every day or couple of days in some really remote parts of @entity42			0
‘ after a couple of weeks mulling over the problem , my mind was led to the concept of washboards			0

the @entity13 was invented by @entity40 when he was packing for a holiday in @entity42 and realised he only had room for a few changes of clothes as clothes are rubbed along the washboard , the bumps create friction and water movement though the clothes , which assists in dislodging oils and dirt from the clothes ‘ the @entity13 wash bag works using the same principles as the old fashion washboard , but with the advantage that you do n't have to get your hands wet			1
