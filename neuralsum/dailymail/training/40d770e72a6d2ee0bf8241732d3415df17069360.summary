@entity0 is set to agree a move to @entity2 wednesday after holding talks with the @entity5 club and their @entity7 rivals @entity6			1
wednesday matched @entity6 ’s £ 800,000 bid for the player in midweek and they appeared to have won the race for @entity13 ’s talismanic striker			1
the 21 - year - old ’s decision will delight @entity15 strike partner @entity16 , who enjoyed a happy stint with the @entity18 between 2004 and 2007 — and had already informed may that the chance to follow in his footsteps there is one he should n’t pass up			1
‘ @entity22 would be a great move for @entity0 , i ’ve told him that , ’ said @entity16			2
‘ the decision is his , of course , but i told him the fans there will love him			2
they love a goalscorer and a player who gives their all — he ’s ideal for them			2
if he progresses the way he has , he ’ll become a top player			2
’ the term ‘ sleeping giant ’ may be something of a cliche but @entity16 believes may will be blown away by the sheer size of the @entity5 outfit			1
‘ they get 20 - odd thousand on a bad day , and over 30,000 on a decent day — the club ’s just huge			2
‘ it ’s a @entity49 club playing in the @entity7			1
playing there was the best time of my career			0
we took over 40,000 to @entity55 for a @entity57 play - off final			1
‘ the potential is massive , they need to get to the @entity49 again and , once they do , it will take off			0
’ @entity15 boss @entity61 has already tied up a loan deal for former @entity64 youngster @entity63 but there will be a collective need to replace may ’s goals			1
‘ the lads are going to be sad to see @entity0 go , ’ admitted @entity16 ahead of tomorrow ’s league opener at @entity69			0
‘ he ’s a much better player than i ever was and i scored a few in the @entity7 in @entity73 , so he ’ll do really well			1
great potential : @entity0 should thrive in the championship ‘ nobody will pretend we ’re not going to miss him because he ’s been such a massive player for us			0
but it ’ll be up to us to help @entity63 when he comes in and also spread goals around the team more			0
’ may netted his final @entity15 goal in thursday ’s 1 - 1 @entity83 draw with @entity84 in @entity85			1
that creditable display was rendered futile by the preceding 2 - 1 home leg defeat , a performance that still irks @entity15			1
‘ we were well in the game in @entity85 and if we ’d played them first out there we would have won , ’ said @entity16			0
‘ you ca n’t take your foot off the pedal in @entity94 because as soon as your standards dip then teams will punish you			0
‘ we salvaged a bit of pride in the second leg but we ’ve beaten a really good @entity101 side ( @entity102 ) and came up short against a decent @entity104 team			0
’ saints ’ domestic season begins with a trip to @entity108 tomorrow , a test that requires rapid recovery			0
‘ people used to wonder why @entity112 and @entity113 struggled after playing in @entity94 but now we can see why , ’ said @entity16			0
‘ it ’s tough on your body , especially for the older players , but you have to just rest up and try to recover the best you can			0
