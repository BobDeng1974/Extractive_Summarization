they said mrs @entity22 should find another travel companion			1
mrs @entity22 , a retired support worker for a women ’s refuge , told portsmouth.co.uk : ‘ it ’s really appalling that they still have n’t sent a letter of apology			1
‘ i have n’t had the time to chase the company up on it because @entity13 went downhill very quickly , and my concern was n’t about the travel operator at that time			1
‘ they did reimburse some money , but it ’s not about that			2
it was about the way they spoke to my daughters when they called to cancel the holiday			0
' mrs @entity22 said the couple ( pictured on a previous holiday to @entity16 ) go out to the destination about four times a year every year to see friends mrs @entity22 also claims one of her daughters was told to ' shut up ' - and said she has not had an apology			1
@entity25 have so far paid back £ 538 for the holiday in june , which cost £ 1,900			1
refunds for the october holiday have still not been sorted out			0
mr @entity12 told @entity74 in may , after her husband 's diagnosis : ‘ ' i am so angry about this			1
it ’s not about the money as we are sorting it with our insurance			2
' i want an apology for the way we have been spoken to			0

' their daughter @entity91 , 36 , called @entity25 with the news in may and was warned that not all the money would be refunded			1
the couple had booked and paid for a trip to @entity16 next month to celebrate their 38th wedding anniversary ( file picture ) she said ' the attitude of the person on the phone was appalling - i was told to " shut up " at one point			1
' there was no empathy to my dad ’s situation			0
he did n’t want this to happen			0
' @entity111 and dad have used @entity25 for the past four years and thought they would show more compassion			2
' instead they suggested my mum should go on holiday with someone else			2
' @entity74 has contacted @entity25 for a comment			2
according to @entity25 's website , customers who have travel insurance with @entity120 may be covered if they were unaware they had a condition at the time of booking			1
the company does say however the insurance does not cover those who knew there was a possibility they may have to cancel			0
in more general circumstances , the @entity131 says under package holiday regulations , customers ' only have the right to cancel if your organiser has made major changes to your holiday			0
' it goes on to say : ' if your organiser has n’t made any changes to your holiday your right to cancel will depend on the terms and conditions of your holiday contract			0
you may be able to cancel your holiday but your organiser might charge you a cancellation fee			0
' you will normally be able to find information about your organiser ’s cancellation policy in your holiday brochure or with your booking information '			2
in may , a spokesman said : ' @entity25 is very sorry to hear that @entity153 and mrs @entity22 were unhappy with the service they received when cancelling their holiday			1
' we sympathise with their situation and understand this must be a very difficult time			0
' our customer service and retail teams always aim to offer the best possible service to all customers and this includes providing them with details of all the options available to them			0
' we would like to reassure the couple that we never intended to cause offence or undue upset by providing this information			2
' as their holiday has now been cancelled we have advised mr and mrs quick to contact their insurance provider to settle their claim			1
' in february this year , @entity74 reported on grandfather @entity178 who won a full refund from @entity25 in a landmark case			2
mr @entity178 , 66 , launched his battle with parent company @entity182 after he was forced to cancel a holiday when his wife @entity184 , 63 , fell ill. instead they charged him the full £ 2,256 for the two - week break the couple were due to have last may in @entity187 at the luxury @entity189			0
but the retired civil servant managed to prove the company was not out of pocket after the flights and hotel room vanished from the @entity25 website before the departure date			2
he argued this meant they had managed to sell the package on			0
in february , he became one of the first holidaymakers in the @entity202 to be awarded damages from a tour operator for a cancelled holiday			0
the pensioner , who represented himself at @entity207 , was awarded a full refund as well as £ 300 court costs			0
