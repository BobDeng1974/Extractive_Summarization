we did 8 nails in one base plain colour , and the nail on the ring finger of each hand in a @entity10 design			1
to do all 10 you 'd need about a day and infinite patience ! we used seven colours on each skull nail ( if you 're counting the white base ! ) , eight tiny gold balls , a couple of @entity268 fimo flowers and 2 gems			2

file and buff nails , then apply base coat 2			2
paint the nail all white 3			0
start with the triangle on the forehead , then the nose , then the teeth : create a straight line near the edge of the nail , then create the scallopedgnashers 4			0
use fimo 3d flowers for the eyes and stick gem in centre ( you can get these on @entity283 ! ) 5			0
finally , be creative ! add beads , swirls , dots and hearts with a nail art pen 6			0
seal with top coat cheeky tip : if you have a gel kit , leave the flowers off , apply a coat of clear top gel , pop the flowers and gems on , and cure the nail			0
