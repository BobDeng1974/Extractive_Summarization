by @entity0 published : 16:17 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 : 16:17 est , 29 november 2013 the astonishing greed of bankers was laid bare last night as it was revealed their salaries soared by more than a third last year			1
while the rest of the nation coped with an unprecedented squeeze on incomes , @entity7 workers were enjoying the high life , with the top 2,700 taking home an average of £ 1.6million each			1
the figure – which makes @entity17 ’s financial elite the highest paid in @entity18 – flies in the face of the banks ’ repeated claims that they have scaled down enormous pay rewards in the wake of the financial crisis			1
allegations : last night there were claims the sector had learned nothing from the financial crash last night there were claims that the sector had learned nothing from the greatest financial crash for decades – a crisis that their own greed and incompetence was in part to blame for			1
the figures also follow a string of scandals at the country ’s lenders over mis - selling , failing to help struggling small businesses , and rigging lending rates			0
campaigners said that while @entity7 salaries have soared , ordinary families are still facing the worst squeeze on household income in living memory			0
average workers saw wages rise by a minuscule 0.8 per cent last year , well below the rate of inflation			1
but figures from @entity62 - based watchdog the @entity59 show that last year 2,714 ‘ high earners ’ received salary , bonus and pension packages worth at least £ 830,000			1
soaring salaries : the average pay reward for workers in the @entity7 was £ 1.6million , up from £ 1.2million in 2011 this is 12 times the number in any other @entity72 country			1
the average pay reward was £ 1.6million , up from £ 1.2million in 2011			1
by contrast , there are just 212 euro - millionaire bankers in @entity77 , and their average pay was £ 1.3million , almost a fifth less than their counterparts in the @entity17			1
@entity80 , chairman of campaign group the @entity81 , said the report made a mockery of the banks ’ claims to have reined in lavish payouts			1
‘ this goes to prove that the idea that banks are cutting back is a lie , ’ she said			2
‘ they claim they are showing restraint – but everyone else is suffering from cuts in living standards while bankers are living the high life			0
’ @entity98 , the @entity100 mp and member of the @entity102 , said : ‘ the banks are failing to lend and giving themselves staggering increases in pay			1
this is despite the fact that the reason they are doing well is because of quantitative easing – in other words taxpayers lending them money			0
’ the @entity7 watchdog has begun an industry - wide inquiry into banks ’ lending to small businesses , after claims of ‘ unscrupulous ’ practices at @entity119			1
the @entity120 said it will look at claims that state - backed @entity119 forced some business customers into collapse to seize their assets			0
the regulator said it will also write to other banks ‘ seeking confirmation that they are satisfied they do not engage in any of the poor practices ’			0
the @entity132 said net lending to business fell by £ 1.2billion in october – reversing a £ 714million rise in september			2
@entity136 of @entity137 said it showed that fictional @entity141 villian @entity139 was ‘ alive and well and living in the @entity62 ’			0
the huge pay rises come despite bank bosses repeatedly insisting they have cleaned up their culture in an effort to win back the public ’s trust			0
@entity119 chairman sir @entity149 said last year : ‘ @entity150 is falling in this industry and has been falling in recent years			0
’ and addressing shareholders at its annual general meeting earlier this year , @entity153 chairman sir @entity152 said : ‘ it is without question that in @entity153 , and more widely in the banking industry , pay became excessive			2
’ but critics say the figures show that behind the scenes bankers are intent on carrying on paying themselves just as much as before the crisis , if not more			0
experts said the generous increase in bonuses was partly fuelled by the government ’s money printing stimulus – quantitative easing – which has helped push up share prices			0
bonuses are typically paid partly in bank shares , which rose sharply last year			2
the six and seven - figure banker bonuses have also put the @entity7 on course for a showdown with @entity178 because the awards breach strict limits on payouts which will be introduced next year			2
the highest earners in the @entity17 have been bagging bonuses averaging 3.7 times their basic salary			1
that is well above a new @entity72 - wide cap that will limit them to a maximum of one year ’s annual salary , or an upper limit of two years ’ salary if shareholders approve			0
criticism : @entity194 , a @entity100 mp on the @entity102 ( left ) , said bankers were giving themselves pay rises while taxpayers lent them money and @entity119 chairman sir @entity149 claimed last year that ' pay is falling in this industry and has been falling in recent years ' despite public anger over boardroom greed , the government has lodged a legal challenge against the @entity59 bonus cap with the @entity206			1
it fears the banks will respond to a cap by pushing up basic pay for top staff			2
banks have complained they will lose staff to non @entity72 and @entity215 rivals which do not have similar pay restrictions if the bonus cap is introduced			2
industry lobby groups defended the pay rises			0
@entity219 , chief executive of @entity220 , said : ‘ @entity221 is the world ’s leading financial centre			0
that means we attract the best people around the world to the @entity17			2
it would be unfortunate if the @entity7 were to lose this mantle , because we ’d lose the tax that companies and individuals pay			0

the figure make **'s** @entity17 **'s** financial elite the highest paid in @entity18
these bankers also had pension packages worth at least £ 830,000
average workers saw wages rise by a minuscule 0.8 per cent last year
