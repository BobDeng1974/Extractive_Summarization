the image of @entity1 sat on the bench at @entity3 , four days after the pictures of him sat in the stands at the @entity6 , will have had more than one @entity8 manager thinking : ' what a waste , what i would n’t give for the chance to play him in my side			2
' @entity15 , about whom @entity1 tells the story of being pushed over by as a teenage apprentice at the @entity6 , and being told he was n’t strong enough to be a defender by the boisterous then - @entity20 manager , will know that @entity1 has more experience and defensive know - how in his locker than the sum total of the @entity27 ’s current @entity26 resources			1
@entity28 , fresh from seeing his defence surrender a three - goal lead against @entity31 will be similarly puzzled as to why someone who has so much of the composure and vision to turn defence into attack quickly , something he loves in a defender , is currently not good enough to play for @entity20			1
as things stand there would be two main obstacles to him returning to @entity42			0
the first is his own desire to make things work at @entity20 and the second is @entity20 ’s current transfer ban			1
@entity1 told @entity67 before the @entity68 : ' i left a lot of friends at @entity43 and i was really happy there even though i did not play as much as i wanted to			1
but i always said that i want to retire here ( @entity20 ) and if it is possible i want to stay here all my career			0
' @entity1 shares a joke with @entity77 during training at the @entity78 on tuesday the loyalty to the club his grandfather was a director of and who he helped lead to two @entity84 cups under @entity85 is genuine and persuading him to walk away would not be easy			0
what he also said in that frank and open interview ahead of the visit to the @entity89 was : ' at this moment i am not thinking about leaving , ' adding : ' i am really happy if it is true that @entity43 want me but i want to stay			0
' he always speaks warmly of @entity43 and joked about how frustrating it was to be in the shadow of @entity95 and @entity96 , two players who he said never seemed to get so much as a red card that would at least give him the chance to play			0
@entity1 celebrates scoring for @entity43 against @entity99 with @entity95 in 2007 he is also in contact with @entity101 who knows what it is like to feel unappreciated at the @entity6 and forced to find a first team berth somewhere else			2
in an ideal world @entity101 would still be living up the coast from @entity20 in @entity107 , close to his family and would be ever - present in the @entity20 team but players must go where best suits their career and seeing how @entity101 has rejuvenated at @entity113 will have at least made him think			0
the other major obstacle to something happening as soon as january is the transfer ban hanging over @entity20			1
they can not sign anyone until the end of the season at the earliest so why would they weaken their defensive resources by losing @entity1 without being able to sign replacements ? in december they will find out if the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) is going to allow them to sign players at the end of the season – reducing the current ban on two transfer windows to just one			2
if @entity125 does come down in their favour then @entity8 suitors might begin their enquiries			0
@entity1 's loyalty to @entity20 and the club 's transfer ban could stand in the way of him moving back to @entity42 the other option open to the defender is to wait out @entity141 ’s reign			1
@entity20 are in the midst of an unstable period when coaches staying for four seasons as @entity85 did seem long gone			0
the @entity20 coach could also change his mind about @entity1 and bring him back in to the fold			1
with his personal favourite @entity150 injured on wednesday night and the @entity20 board ’s other summer signing @entity153 still nowhere near fitness , @entity1 ’s absence from the starting line - up seemed even more bizarre			2
most @entity20 fans want @entity156 moved into a midfield weakened by @entity159 ’ drop in form and @entity1 back alongside @entity161 , but for now @entity141 does not agree			1
@entity1 has time for a smile in the stands despite being dropped by @entity141 asked after wednesday ’s game what exactly it is he is looking for from @entity1 : ' a change in attitude or performance ? ' the @entity20 coach hesitated over his answer , buying time by asking for the question to be repeated , and ultimately side - stepped the issue by saying he did n’t speak about individuals and just wanted the ' maximum ' from everybody			1
@entity1 may not be the player he was four years ago when @entity179 and @entity20 were in their pomp , but he remains good enough for @entity20 ’s current defensive options and comfortably good enough to walk into most @entity8 defences			2
as it becomes increasingly difficult to understand him being left out in the cold , those who would welcome him with open arms will continue to be encouraged			0
@entity141 ( centre ) has preferred @entity150 , @entity156 and @entity161 at centre back			0

@entity1 dropped by @entity20 for games against @entity46 and @entity190
@entity43 would be *interested* in bringing him back to @entity26
@entity193 boss @entity28 may also look towards the @entity194
however , @entity20 's transfer ban and @entity1 's loyalty could stand in the way
