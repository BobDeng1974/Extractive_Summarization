in a letter to other @entity18 leaders last night , the prime minister said businesses had to do most of the work to kick - start growth , create jobs and foster innovation - and pointed out the @entity75 had agreed that removing unnecessary red tape was essential to help them thrive			1

he added : ‘ it ’s vital that business can take full advantage of the @entity18 ’s single market			1
' but all too often @entity18 rules are a handicap for firms , hampering their efforts to succeed in the global race			1
' business people , particularly owners of small firms , are forced to spend too much time complying with pointless , burdensome and costly regulations and that means less time developing a new product , winning contracts or hiring young recruits			2
' i ’m determined to change that and to get the @entity18 working for business , not against it			1
‘ at next week ’s @entity75 , i ’ll be calling for a clear commitment to sweep away unnecessary bureaucratic barriers and to unleash private sector growth - helping to secure the economic recovery for all			0

@entity7 should also fast - track measures to set a maximum cap on the fees that can be applied to card , internet and mobile payments , reducing costs for retailers and consumers			0
