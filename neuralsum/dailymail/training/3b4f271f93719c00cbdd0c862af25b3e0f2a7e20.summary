@entity6 , 34 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , visited the studio in @entity10 , @entity11 , with her husband @entity12 , 33 , and daughter @entity13 , seven , but there was n't a wizard cloak big enough to fit around her size 24 figure when she posed for a fancy dress snap			1

determined to return for a better photo opportunity , @entity6 went home after the incident in october 2012 and immediately set to work shedding the weight she had gained since giving birth to a stillborn son in 2008 and comfort eating through the grief			1
she proudly returned to the studio last month with her family and niece , @entity32 , 10 , to show off her new size 14 figure			1
@entity6 now weighs a healthy 14st 6lb and posed for the same photo and this time needed just one gown @entity6 and daughter @entity13 on their first visit to @entity53 in october 2012 @entity6 , pictured with daughter @entity13 , began gaining weight seriously after her son @entity55 was stillborn in 2008 remembering the incident , @entity6 said : ' i decided to go for the first photo even though i was insecure			1
' we queued for ages and when we finally got to put on the wizard robes , i said to a worker jokingly : " have you got one big enough for me ? "			0
' ' he said yes of course , but came back and said he did n't			2
' so he got two and pinned them together on my back in front of absolutely everybody in the queue and i had to put an arm in each robe with the spare arms hanging behind me			0
' my daughter and husband looked so embarrassed and i was absolutely mortified			1
she hugged my leg and said ' mummy it 's ok ' but she had gone bright red			0
' i smiled for the photograph but i wanted to cry			0
you could also get photos of you on a broomstick and i really wanted one done but i did n't because of how silly i 'd look as such a large lady on such a small stick			0
' it was just a horrible day that left me feeling anxious and upset			0
' @entity6 , after losing six and a half stone in weight , with her daughter @entity13 @entity6 said : ' i 'm so much happier now , and i know it 's made my family happier			1
my husband is very supportive and that 's really helped ' @entity6 had always been overweight and as a child hid chocolate under her bed , but her weight really spiralled out of control after her son @entity55 was stillborn in 2008			1
but in 2013 she lost 6st 4lbs in just over a year with the help of her local @entity101			0
she added : ' i have just always been an emotional eater , but as i ate more i became more depressed			0
' losing @entity55 was so hard that i did n't even realise how big i was getting			1
i 'm so glad i have finally lost all the weight			2
it felt so good to go back there and have none of the problems i experienced before			0
' i 'm so much happier now , and i know it 's made my family happier			0
my husband is very supportive and that 's really helped and he 's obviously pleased that i can have days out without feeling embarrassed and insecure			2
' my arthritis has also completely eased up which has made me more active			0
' @entity6 , who joined her local slimming world in order to lose the weight , says her arthritis has cleared up since going on a diet @entity116 , when she was also celebrating her dramatic weight - loss			2
