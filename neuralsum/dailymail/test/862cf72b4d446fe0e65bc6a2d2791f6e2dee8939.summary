a once in a lifetime shot , they said , but it appears @entity4 has done it before			2
the @entity7 midfielder has been the talk of football this @entity10 weekend after his incredible 66 - yard goal against @entity12			2
@entity4 's sweetly struck left - footed strike gave goalkeeper @entity14 absolutely no chance			0
scroll down to watch video of @entity4 scoring from the halfway line in 2009 @entity4 picks the ball up inside his own half during a reserve match against @entity21 @entity4 knocks the ball out in front of him before spotting the goalkeeper of his line and shooting the @entity28 keeper tries desperately to stop the ball as it sails towards the goal the goalkeeper is left sprawled on the floor as the ball hits the back of the net and that is not the first time the @entity39 has had a goalkeeper frantically back - pedalling before picking the ball out of his own net			1
back in 2009 , @entity4 scored a similar effort for @entity45 reserves against @entity21			1
he was in the opposition half this time though was out wide before hitting an effort that draws similarities with @entity50 's famous goal against @entity51 in 1996			0
the stage , it has to be said , was far smaller too , though it 's easy to see why @entity4 backed himself at @entity54 on this evidence .			0
