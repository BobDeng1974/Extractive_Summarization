unwilling : the @entity0 also found nearly two - thirds of @entity2 were not willing to join into larger groups to ensure one surgery in an area was open on saturdays and sundays @entity2 are in revolt over @entity8 plans for them to offer patients appointments seven days a week			1
almost all family doctors polled in a new survey said they do not think their own practice should open on weekends			2
and nearly two - thirds are not even willing to consider forming groups with other surgeries to ensure that at least one in the area is open to patients on saturdays and sundays			1
the government has tried to encourage @entity2 to offer out - of - hours appointments through a scheme known as the prime minister ’s @entity24 , launched in 2013			0
surgeries have been urged to form into groups of 20 to 30 to ensure that between them at least one stays open in the evenings and at weekends			0
the results of early trials published last month showed that among 34 practices taking part in the scheme in @entity38 , the number of patients going to @entity34 dropped by between 8 and 10 per cent			1
but a survey of 15,560 gps by their union , the @entity0 , found 63 per cent were opposed to forming networks with other surgeries to open seven days a week			1
some 94 per cent were against their own practice opening every day			0
just 2 per cent were in favour , while the remainder did n’t know			0
the survey also found that 67 per cent want to make the standard ten minute appointment longer to give them more time to properly care for patients			2
and 93 per cent said their heavy workload has negatively affected patient care			1
this is mainly because they do not have the staff or the resources to provide appointments to the increasing numbers seeking them			0
dr @entity60 , chairman of the @entity0 ’s @entity61 , said : ‘ gps want to provide better services and spend more time with their patients , especially the increasing number of older people who often have a range of multiple health needs that require intensive , coordinated care			2
' unfortunately , this landmark poll highlights that @entity2 ’ ability to care for patients is being seriously undermined by escalating workload , inadequate resourcing and unnecessary paperwork			0
drop : a trial period opening @entity2 surgeries seven days a week found the numbers going to @entity34 fell ‘ while there is a willingness from @entity2 to look at offering extended hours , more than nine in ten gps do not feel that their practice can provide blanket seven day services when gps are struggling to provide even basic care to their patients			1
‘ gps also feel it is more important to provide longer consultations			0

two thirds are also not willing to consider joining into a group to ensure at least one surgery in an area is open on saturdays and sundays
but weekend trials show numbers going to @entity34 fell by 8 to 10 per cent
survey by @entity0 also found most felt 10 minute appointments to short , while heavy workloads meant patient care suffered
