@entity0 is taking on the whole of @entity2 on tuesday , although his local hero opponent actually has ambitions to become an @entity6 man			1
@entity7 , carrying the hopes of a nation as he tackles @entity0 in the @entity11 quarter - final , is house - hunting around the @entity14 area as he plans the next step in his blossoming career			1
although his clash with @entity0 has been built up along the lines of the @entity21 , the 19 - year - old from @entity18 has quite a few @entity23 connections which are likely to get stronger as he plans his career			1
@entity25 's @entity0 marches on at the expense of @entity27 after a tough game in @entity2 @entity0 had to dig deep to see off the challenge of @entity27 ( left ) at @entity30 the heir apparent to the likes of @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 knows that having a base outside @entity2 is essential , and @entity6 seems to fit the bill			1
known as ‘ @entity39 ’ due to his animated on - court personality , which includes a tendency to swear and smash his rackets , there are some mixed feelings about @entity45 in his home country , rather like there were with @entity34 and @entity35			0
‘ he ’s not won anything yet has he ? ’ harrumphed one veteran @entity2 @entity50 champion , before adding that he nonetheless believed @entity7 to be ‘ the real deal ’			2
this ambivalence among some partly explains why @entity7 has yet to play on the main @entity55 , the venue of the match against @entity0 starting at 8.15am @entity23 time			1
@entity7 has a penchant for shouting , gold necklaces and snazzy hair now a tall , lean athlete , @entity7 was not quite so trim in his youth imagine a @entity23 teenage sensation getting to the @entity66 quarter - finals without having played on the @entity67			1
his absence from there has been partly because @entity2 ’s tennis hierarchy do not want him to get too carried away with himself , and they have handed @entity0 a small advantage due to his familiarity with the arena			2
it could be that , like @entity34 , @entity7 finds himself being able to relax more in @entity76 , where he enjoyed his finest hour by beating @entity78 at @entity66 last year			0
his associations include having a @entity23 manager and training occasionally at the @entity81 in @entity82			0
he is also a @entity83 supporter and his sister @entity84 , a singer and actress , has lived in @entity86 for several years			0
@entity7 falls to the ground as he celebrates winning his fourth round match against @entity89 the @entity2 media are somewhat divided on @entity91 , admiring his extravagant shot - making and fighting instincts , but unsure what to make of his blingy persona , stripy haircut and emotional outbursts			1
his manager @entity98 knows him better than most , having signed him up to his company @entity99 as a 15 - year - old			0
‘ basically he is a great lad with a big heart , ’ @entity98 said			0
‘ of course he is still young and there has been a lot for him to handle in a short space of time			0
‘ the sunday before the tournament started we were not even sure whether he was going to play due to back problems , so really he does not have much to lose against @entity0 — he can go out there and enjoy himself			2
’ a fired up @entity7 came from behind to to beat @entity111 player @entity89 ( pictured ) on sunday @entity7 , whose painter - decorator father is of @entity114 heritage and whose mother is originally from @entity116 , loves the big occasion and is a player you can not take your eyes off			1
during his five - set comeback win against @entity89 on sunday he spotted three fans sneaking out of the stadium and shouted : ‘ @entity126 ! where are you going ? ’ he told another spectator making a surreptitious call : ‘ get off your f * * * ing phone ! ’ @entity7 , who showed plenty of promise as a basketball player before concentrating on tennis , also shows his fondness for the big time in his results since emerging from the @entity137 circuit to make such a splash at @entity66			1
he made the quarter - finals at @entity140 and the third round of the @entity142 before his run here , but strangely has won only one match on the regular @entity145 apart from that			2
@entity2 's @entity147 takes a shot in the fourth round of the @entity11 tennis tournament it is still enough to have propelled him to what will be a minimum ranking of 35 , regardless of how he fares against @entity0 — far ahead of any other teenager			2
his natural power is something uncoachable and , going into the last eight he had hit 97 aces , more than any other player in the tournament			0
in @entity2 they also know that he is in the vanguard of a young generation who are set to revive the country ’s proud tennis heritage , which for too many years has been over-reliant on the fading force of @entity35			0
along with @entity45 there is the mercurial @entity147 and 18 - year - old @entity169 , with all three having genuine top - 10 potential			0
@entity0 sees something of his younger , more tempestuous self in today ’s opponent and understands the pressures of performing at your home @entity50			0
provided @entity0 is able to reproduce the outstanding form he showed in dismissing @entity27 from the fourth round , it will surely be enough to subdue the explosive power of the young @entity2 , and the huge support he will enjoy			2
@entity27 of @entity182 celebrates a point in the second set in his fourth round match against @entity0			1

@entity0 and @entity7 go head - to - head in last eight match
@entity0 beat @entity27 on sunday to *progress* to the next round
@entity7 beat @entity111 player @entity89 to set up clash with @entity0
@entity7 has @entity23 connections and is looking to move to @entity6
