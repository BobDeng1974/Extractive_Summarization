by @entity0 published : 12:20 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 19:17 est , 14 january 2013 president @entity1 warned republicans on monday against failing to raise the debt ceiling , saying the move would withhold money from @entity7 troops and @entity9 recipients			1
' they will not collect ransom in exchange for not crashing the @entity7 economy , ' @entity1 said of @entity2 , many of whom have vowed to delay raising the debt ceiling until @entity1 commits to steep spending cuts			1
' @entity7 can not afford another debate with this @entity19 about whether or not they should pay the bills they have already racked up , ' @entity1 continued			1
he piled pressure on @entity2 , pointning out the consequences of @entity7 failing to pay its bills			1
' we are not a deadbeat nation , ' he said repeatedly			0
' if congressional @entity2 refuse to pay @entity7 ’s bills on time , @entity9 checks and veterans ’ benefits will be delayed , ' @entity1 said			1
' we might not be able to pay our troops or honor our contracts with small business owners			0
' threatening the safety of @entity7 at home and abroad , @entity1 also warned that food inspectors , air traffic controllers and specialists who collect loose nuclear material would not be paid			2
' markets could go haywire , ' he said			0
' interest rates would spike for anybody who borrows money - every homeowner with a mortgage , every student with a college loan , every small business owner who wants to grow and hire			0
' the move would slow down the recovery and ' might tip us into a recession , ' he said			0
' to even entertain the idea of this happening - of the @entity7 not paying its bills - is irresponsible			2
' responding to @entity68 calls to offset increases in the debt ceiling with an equal amount of cuts , @entity1 said the two issues should be considered separately			1
' the debt ceiling is not a question of authorizing more spending , ' he said			1
' raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending , it simply allows the country to pay for spending that @entity19 has already committed to ... these are bills that have already been racked up and we need to pay them			1
' meanwhile , house speaker @entity85 , @entity86 , released a statement insisting that @entity88 accept new spending controls			2
' the @entity7 people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing government spending at the same time , ' @entity85 said			1
' @entity93 will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending , meets our nation 's obligations and keeps the government running , and we will insist that the @entity88 majority in @entity102 do the same			0
' @entity1 rebuked the cuts that @entity2 have proposed and challenged them to bring the proposals to @entity19 for a vote @entity1 rebuked the cuts that @entity2 have proposed and challenged them to bring the proposals to @entity19 for a vote			1
' if they think that they can get that through @entity19 , then they are free to go ahead and try , ' @entity1 said , calling out @entity85 and @entity111 minority leader @entity110 , @entity112 , by name			2
he said he refused to accept that @entity19 would risk a default to make a political point			2
@entity1 held the press conference , the last of his first term , as it was revealed that more than half of @entity93 @entity2 are prepared to allow the @entity7 to default on its debt unless he commits to steep spending cuts			1
' we always talk about whether or not we ’re going to kick the can down the road , ' @entity122 chairwoman @entity121 told @entity126			0
' i think the mood is that we ’ve come to the end of the road			0
' while the results of a default would be dire for the economy , most @entity2 agree it 's a better option than allowing additional debt to pile up without an equal - or - greater offset of deep spending cuts			1
if @entity93 @entity2 choose not to force president @entity1 's hand on spending cuts with the threat of a default , they are planning to shut down the government in march when a six - month temporary funding measure expires			1
' i think it is possible that we would shut down the government to make sure president @entity1 understands that we ’re serious , ' @entity121 said			2
@entity19 has been repeatedly authorizing temporary funding measures to pay for government operations over the last three years , since lawmakers have been unable to compromise on an annual budget since 2009			2
the last temporary measure was passed in september and it expires on march 27			0
republicans threatened a shutdown over budget negotiations in the spring of 2011 but a deal was eventually reached ( albeit an hour after the deadline ) to avert a suspension of operations			0
the government has shut down a total of 15 times since @entity161 was president , with most of these episodes lasting only a couple days			0
one of the most famous shutdowns in history was in 1995 , when the government was left without funding for 21 days due to a budget standoff between president @entity168 and then - house speaker @entity169			0
during that time , from dec. 16 , 1995 to jan. 6 , 1996 , roughly 800,000 federal workers were furloughed and ' nonessential ' government functions were suspended , including the processing of visas and cleanup at toxic waste sites			0
the episode also closed national museums , monuments and hundreds of national park sites .			0
