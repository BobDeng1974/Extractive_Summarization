he ran up to his bedroom and was later found hanged by his nine - year - old brother @entity16			1
the coroner at his inquest said he believed the teenager had hoped his younger brother or father would follow him and find him in time			1
@entity2 , from @entity22 , @entity23 , was a ' typical teenager ' who was described as ' cheeky and mischievous , ' his parents said			2
in a statement his 31 - year old father @entity24 told the hearing in @entity27 : ' he was a typical teenage lad			1
he pushed the boundaries as may be expected and got into trouble at school on a few occasions - but nothing terribly serious			2
' we had no problems with him , nothing gave us huge cause for concern			0
' but the inquest was told mr @entity2 and @entity2 's mother @entity38 , 32 , decided to ground their son and his mobile phone was taken away from him for a week			1
in the day before his death he was allowed to go out and see his grandmother who lived close by , before watching films with his younger brother @entity16 , nine			1
on the day of the tragedy on july 7 , @entity38 left for work as a kitchen assistant at a care home at 11.30am and @entity50 was at home with the two boys			0
bereft : @entity54 ( left ) and @entity55 ( far right ) , the parents of @entity2 , outside @entity57 following the inquest into their son 's death upset : @entity2 's family home , where he was found hanged by his nine - year - old brother after a row with his father he said : ' it was a hot day and they were in and out of the house , they came in and out , watched tv with me and went out again			1
at 5.30pm @entity2 asked if he could have his phone back			1
' the @entity27 inquest heard mr @entity2 told his son it was n't due back until later and he said @entity2 ' was n't happy about it ' and got up and left the room			1
he added : '' he was due to get it back on the monday , the day after			2
he got up and left the room			0
' i heard the front door to the house open and close and presumed he had simply gone out			0
i thought he accepted it and made his way outside			0
' grief : outgoing @entity2 's death shocked his family and friends and led to graffiti tributes like this one shocked : the 13 - year - old , pictured with a puppy , was a happy young man and his death could not be predicted , his inquest heard @entity16 later went to the room he shared with @entity92 to find the body of his brother			1
mr @entity2 alerted by his youngest son ran upstairs and tried to revive his eldest son but in vain			1

he added : ' there was nothing days or hours beforehand that made me think for even one minute that anything was wrong			0
i still find it so difficult to believe			0
there were no signs he was depressed or wanting to hurt himself in any way			0
' recording a verdict of misadventure , the coroner @entity119 told the family : ' i 'm sorry you have had to relive this today but we have to do it to make it as straightforward for you without ignoring the importance of an inquest			1
' i can not imagine what you have had to go through over these last few months , my sympathies are with you all			0
whether @entity2 deliberately took his own life i can not come to that conclusion for a number of reasons			2
' whilst he has done a deliberate act , i would have to conclude that his intention was to end his life by doing that , and that is a step too far			2
' i can not believe that is what he wanted to do , a happy - go - lucky teenager showing no signs of him ever considering something like this			0
' i feel the appropriate conclusion i should draw is one of misadventure			0
it is the unexpected outcome of a deliberate action , yes he has done something , but i do not believe for one moment that he actually intended to end his life			2
' this is why i asked the question about the front door being open and shut , he may have expected someone to come upstairs after him			0
' @entity2 's family were too upset to comment after the hearing , at the time of the tragedy they told how he would enjoy fishing , magic tricks , bmx biking and skateboarding and had been about to try out for the athletics team at school			1

in an interview at the time of his death mr @entity2 said : ' when he was at home he was quite outgoing , but when he was out and about he was a bit shy really			2
he was always playing games on his mobile , you 'd think it was glued to his hand			0
' @entity2 's grandmother @entity184 said : ' he was very loving , there are no words to describe how much he will be missed			2
i did n't realise how many people knew him			0
lots of people have passed on their sympathies , he had a bit of mischief to him			0
' you only had to look at that face to wonder what he had been up to			0
