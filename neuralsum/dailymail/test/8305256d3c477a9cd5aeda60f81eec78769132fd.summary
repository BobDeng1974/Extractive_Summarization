that 's what they used to say about the @entity31 and more recently @entity5 and @entity6			1
the propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing , and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image			2
' they see their own lives as poor by comparison , and do n't realise they are being used			0
the extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers – they manipulate them , distance them from their friends and families , and then take them			0
' mr @entity0 added that a community - led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the ' stale ' strategy used by the police and security services			1
the prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young @entity8 role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised , the country could face ' another 7/7 ' terror attack			1
he believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures			0

we need to stand up and say that very , very clearly , rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols			1
' hundreds of young @entity92 are thought to have travelled to @entity93 to join @entity3 , but mr @entity0 believes there are far more ' ticking time bombs ' still in @entity2			1
his comments came as it emerged that the @entity100 councillor 's son caught trying to cross from @entity101 to @entity93 with his family may be part of an extremist group			0
