@entity0 is tired because of the pressure of trying to fill @entity3 's boots at @entity4 ... not playing for @entity5 if @entity6 leaves @entity7 for @entity8 he will be considered an expensive @entity10 flop true measure of a top coach like @entity13 or @entity14 is to find a lower - league gem and make him into a world beater like @entity18 or @entity19 the two recent qualifiers for @entity5 did n’t exactly get the pulses racing did they ? two routine wins in the end			1
but one thing that did excite me a lot from both games was the link up play between @entity30 and @entity31			2
there ’s an understanding which is on the brink of being telepathic and it ’s something special that @entity5 have rarely had			0
when @entity35 was in charge of @entity5 , @entity31 linked up with @entity37 in an equally exciting way			1
they instinctively knew where the other was			0
go back and check out a 3 - 1 win in @entity43 – @entity31 and @entity37 made @entity45 magic that night			1
in fact that whole qualifying campaign for the @entity47 2010 saw @entity5 play some of their best football of recent times with @entity31 and @entity37 at the heart of everything good			1
@entity31 celebrates his goal against @entity54 on sunday with @entity30 ( right ) and @entity55 @entity31 ( left ) and @entity30 worked tirelessly in @entity5 's qualifying win in @entity57 @entity31 curls home the winning free - kick as @entity5 made it three @entity61 qualifying wins from three @entity30 carries the ball forward for @entity5 against @entity54 and has drive and imagination @entity5 's record with their dynamic duo is better than when they are missing ( source @entity67 ) sadly , @entity35 lost his nerve and seemed to lose his mind with team selection , tactics and pretty much everything else about managing a team at a @entity47 , once they pitched up in @entity75			1
this time it could be different			0
@entity77 seems to understand what makes @entity31 tick			2
the @entity5 captain can make some great runs , peeling off a defender , finding time and space - even in the box			0
@entity30 loves to play a killer pass			0
i ’m not one for checking pass completion statistics – if i make 50 two - yard passes back to my keeper as a centre half per game my pass completion stats will be amazing			0
@entity31 embraces @entity37 after scoring for @entity5 in their 3 - 1 win over @entity43 in 2008 rooney scores the second of his two goals in @entity5 's @entity47 qualifying win in @entity45 i suspect his stats suffer because he tries to play difficult balls sometimes			1
but that ’s what you want from top players – adventure , trying the spectacular , having that imagination and creativity to go for something amazing			0
it was only @entity108 last week , and only @entity54 on sunday – i get that			0
but i saw the signs of a link up between @entity30 and @entity31 that might not win @entity5 the @entity112 in 2016 , but it will definitely make us pleasing on the eye			1
@entity77 seems to have an understanding of how to get the best from his captain @entity31			2

@entity31 and @entity30 linked up *brilliantly* for @entity5 in sunday 's 1 - 0 qualifying win over @entity54
they have an *excellent* understanding of each other 's game
it was *reminiscent* of @entity31 and @entity37 in @entity43 back in 2008
@entity77 must harness this when @entity5 head to @entity61
