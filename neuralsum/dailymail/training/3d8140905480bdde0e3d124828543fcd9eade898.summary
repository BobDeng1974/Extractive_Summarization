by @entity0 for the @entity1 on the last day of @entity2 , a revolution of sorts took place			1
for the first time ever , plus - sized clothes were shown on the catwalk			0
you heard me right , sister			0
fashion for fat birds , being paraded as if it was something to be proud of , rather than a collection of sludge - coloured , tent - sized garments to be hidden away in a dusty corner of a department store , never to be spoken of again			1
here , there were togs for the tubs , dresses for the messes ; most of them bright , floaty , lovely things that a woman of a certain size and age might actually want to buy and try			2
rather than buy and cry over because there was nothing else in the shop that fitted her , except a hideous tarpaulin that once might have kept a van dry in the rain but was now masquerading as a party frock			0
or perhaps that was just me ? catwalk revolution : looks from the @entity42 show in @entity43 this week proving plus size clothes can be colourful and fashionable on the catwalk for @entity50 brand @entity42 ' inaugural show , models in silver sandals and peep - toe booties showed cleverly cut bustiers with matching palazzo pants ; plissé dresses in fondant colours ; wafty cardigans that floated down to the floor ; lots of lovely shifts with sequinned straps ; a metallic , pleated skirt that fluttered like gossamer and oyster satin blouses , alongside a number of hugely flattering , all - terrain , bulge - bustin ' , hip - skimming skirts and dresses			1
true , there were some frocky horrors , too , but the @entity70 was a clever collaboration between six high - end designers and the plus - size specialists , which will be in shops next spring			2
in an innovative and mutually beneficial association , the fashion teams reworked designs from their own collections into plus sizes using the @entity42 in - house expertise			1
successful plus size is all about sculpting and cutting , not just adding more and more fabric and hoping for the best - although tragically , that seems to have been the template for about half a century			1
the new designs from @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 use an enticing range of fabrics and really are fresh and covetable			0
well , almost all of them			0
i ca n’t be the only blub tub who is not quite ready for a laser - cut silver pleather skirt , or a bright green evening gown or getting my belly button out , as some of the two - piece combos and slash front tops encourage			0
shape specialists : @entity42 have taken the latest trends and made them flatter larger women bold and beautiful : some more of the @entity42 collection on the catwalk including sequin embellished tops and floaty skirts the show was the brainchild of clothing magnate sir @entity117 , whose @entity120 empire owns @entity42 along with @entity121 , @entity122 and other @entity50 - please do n't take this personally , ladies - giants			1
@entity117 staged the show at the @entity126 in @entity127 on tuesday evening , just as @entity2 ground to a close for another season			1
inside the hall , the fashion @entity132 packed on to white benches to see , with their very own eyes , perhaps for the first time , what anything above a size six might look like			1
as the lights dimmed , the atmosphere was similar to those @entity142 freak shows , when crowds gathered , consumed with equal parts revulsion and fascination , to view bearded ladies and midgets or perhaps a combination of both			0
on the front rows , there was a noticeable lack of the kind of high - velocity celebrity big names that have garlanded other fashion shows this week			2
no @entity157 , no @entity158 or @entity159 , no @entity161 girls , no @entity162 , for no big ( famewise , not shapewise ) star ever wants to be associated with the taint of tub ; the fashion world equivalent of the black spot			2
there was not even a glimpse of @entity171 , the fat - shaming , burger - munching controversialist who has put on four stone to show fatsos how simple it is to lose it again			1
you 'd think she could have had the decency to come and heckle , or to throw chocolate biscuits at the models			0
who , it must be said , did n't look much over a size 16 anyway			1
and in the @entity187 , that is an average size , not a plus size			2
for the more daring : crops tops and belly button flashing outfits meeting demand : the @entity42 show was the brainchild of clothing magnate sir @entity117 who hopes it was the first of many at @entity2 those who did turn up for this momentous moment in the calendar of chub include swimwear designer @entity202 and @entity203 - but she 'd go to the opening of a powder compact			1
still , she crossed her slim ankles and tried to look interested			0
the models were traditionally grim - faced and everyone sipped water in that oddly self - important way			0
apart from that , we were in uncharted waters , with shapely women sporting busts , curves and even the occasional cankle on the catwalk			0
why is this deemed so unusual ? perhaps it is because fashion and fat , like a squirt of astringent lemon on to a pool of double cream , have always separated and reacted badly to each other			1
they are natural enemies , not allies			0
since for ever , fashion has been designed exclusively for tiny , doll - girl women with rosebud breasts and chihuahua hips			2
the rest of us have just had to suffer in silence , while wearing rather too many jersey separates in various shades of @entity238 and @entity239 , kidding ourselves that a glimpse of chiffon shirt tail takes about a stone off and no one will notice we ’re overweight if we wear noir layers and a jaunty scarf			0
star support : @entity247 was on the front row for the @entity42 show well , according to our new saviour @entity117 , those dark days are over			1
after his plus - size show , he said : ' you can not ignore the [ plus - size ] market place			1
and you ca n't be defensive about it , or apologise about it			2
why should the category be any different from petite ? ' why indeed ? a cynic might suppose that plus fashion was never economically viable before , but now that so much of the population is so overweight , all of a sudden the numbers add up			2
for decades , @entity50 plus fashion has been - with a few honourable exceptions - not much more than a jumble sale of shapeless cardies and endless black leggings			2
fat fashion did n't have a season or a theme or a message , it was just a sea of black polyester from spring to spring , an ocean of baggy sacks and waterfall cardigans and peasant smocks that no peasant would ever willingly wear , 45 per cent of @entity187 women are size 16 or over , yet the bestselling dress size is a 12 , followed by a 14 nice clothes and pretty things ? they were for the thin girls			1
the looks we had to choose between were limited and brutal , including @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , and my personal standby , @entity297			0
yet when i visited the @entity42 flagship store in @entity43 's @entity300 this week , it was clear that change was in the air			1
yes , there are still yards of black leggings and all - weather wraps , but @entity42 has quietly rebranded itself as ' shape specialists ' who ' embrace the curve ' in a shop that sells ' reworked designs for fuller - figured ladies			1
' items given pride of place include dresses from designers such as @entity318 and @entity319 , with prices ranging from around £ 30 to £ 70			0
there are also cheery assistants who are knowledgeable , helpful and encouraging			0
they know that if anyone is going to have a plus - size breakdown in the changing room it is going to be us			2
a wonderful lady called @entity329 encouraged me to try a pansy print frock that i would have run a mile from , but which actually looked very ... nice			0
back at the show , @entity117 suggested that @entity42 , which has more than 180 stores in the @entity187 and @entity336 , may even have a catwalk show every season			1
' this is day one , ' he said			0
so is it just a gimmick or genuine change ? eyeing up a lovely @entity89 purple dress on the catwalk , the one with the scarlet ribbons and divine neckline , i do hope , hope , hope it is the former			0

' fashion for fat birds ' is finally being celebrated
@entity42 had a show at @entity2
showed plus size is all about sculpting and cutting
it does n't have to be ugly and boring
