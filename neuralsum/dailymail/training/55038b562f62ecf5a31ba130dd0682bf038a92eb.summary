@entity0 had put herself on a short list of @entity10 seeking their state party 's endorsement to succeed retiring 40 - year rep. @entity15
now she 's running for a state senate seat instead of entering a tougher race for @entity7
she made national headlines two years ago with a ' war on women ' complaint about birth control and @entity58
@entity0 *insisted* that the @entity342 should add contraceptives to its health insurance plan despite @entity346 teachings
a losing @entity349 mayoral candidate and an @entity163 lieutenant colonel are also running in a district that has *swung* to the center
new age author - guru @entity225 may also enter the race despite the *rightward* - shifting politics of the congressional district
