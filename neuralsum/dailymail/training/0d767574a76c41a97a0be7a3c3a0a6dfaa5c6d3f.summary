by @entity0 published : 10:19 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 15 october 2013 with its friendly face and welcoming greeting , a @entity3 fridge manufacturer 's new mascot was supposed to amuse visitors to the firm 's website			0
but the egg - shaped character has caused an online outbreak of the sniggers for all the wrong reasons			1
@entity13 says it is now considering rebranding its cute but somewhat awkwardly named mascot - ' fukuppy '			1
oops : @entity13 is reconsidering the name of its mascot - @entity17 the bizarre character , which has wings and red shoes , has become the source of much ridicule on @entity3 social media sites since he was unveiled in april			1
he greets visitors to the company 's website with a friendly ' i 'm @entity30			0
' but rather than intending to amuse or offend , the unusual moniker , which is unlikely to inspire confidence among consumers regarding the reliability of the firm 's products , is meant to reflect the company 's ethos			0
the name blends the first part of the company 's name - @entity44 - with the last part of the word ' happy ' - reflecting @entity13 ' claims that it is a ' happiness creating company '			1
and while @entity17 claims to be the ' scatterbrained ' one , company bosses are probably regretting not putting more thought into his name			0
the company said in a statement that the name was mistaken for ' an inappropriate word among people in @entity57 - speaking places or its meaning was misunderstood on the @entity59 '			1
no link : the company 's unfortunately named mascot bears no relation to the @entity65 nuclear plant which suffered a series of catastrophes it added : ' we sincerely apologise for worrying many people and creating misunderstanding among them			1
' we will look into the name , including a rethink of it			0
' the firm , which makes industrial cooling systems and has offices in @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , said its name was nothing to do with the stricken @entity65 power station - though many people commenting on the mascot 's unfortunate title said that such an association would be apt following the string of catastrophes suffered by the prefecture			1
unusual custom : @entity94 , unveiled @entity95 as its mascot in a bid to soften the image of the jail the clean - up at the site , where reactors flung radioactive substances into the air , soil and sea in the days and weeks after it was hit by the march 2011 tsunami , has been beset with problems , and continues to come under the spotlight			2
a series of leaks of radiation - contaminated water over recent months came on top of a power outage caused by a stray rat , adding to the widely held impression that the plant 's operator is hapless			2
it is common for companies and organisations in @entity3 to have a cuddly mascot character that they use as part of branding			2
many are brought to life by adults in full - size costumes who wander around sponsored events posing for photographs with children			2
in september , @entity135 in @entity3 's far north unveiled ' @entity137 ' , a 6ft 6ins humanoid with a huge square face and an enormous purple flower for hair , which bosses hoped would soften the image of the jail			0
@entity145 has had its own crime - fighting mascot since the 1980s who is now well - loved across the nation			0
the use of @entity57 , or @entity57 - derived words , is also very common in @entity3 , where despite many years of compulsory language schooling , standards remain relatively low			0
this leads to occasional hilarity among visitors to the country , who struggle to understand why someone would drink the unappetising - sounding @entity159 or the off - putting @entity160			0
bizarre phrases born of poorly understood @entity57 lessons frequently make their way onto t - shirts , stationery and into advertising copy .			1

@entity13 apologised for ' worrying ' customers with the name
the bizarre egg - shaped character became an unlikely *internet* star
