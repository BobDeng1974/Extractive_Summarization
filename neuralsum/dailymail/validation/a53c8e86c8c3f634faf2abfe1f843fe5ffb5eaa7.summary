traditional @entity2 cooker manufacturer @entity0 , favoured by tv chefs @entity4 and @entity5 , has today launched in @entity6 with a brand new feature : a wok burner			1
taking the leap into the new market is arguably the biggest gamble the firm , which has been selling ovens in @entity2 since 1929 , has ever made			1
most @entity15 kitchens have just two gas hobs and , if they have an oven at all , it is usually cheap and the size of a microwave			1
@entity21 : @entity0 has been selling cookers in @entity2 since 1929 and launching in @entity6 is seen as a big gamble			1
@entity24 ( front ) , @entity0 ’s director of business development in @entity6 , said shifting eating habits among the country ’s rich influenced the company ’s decision to launch there @entity2 staple : @entity0 is a favourite of @entity33 and @entity5			1
even the @entity34 has one of the firm 's cookers in his kitchen but @entity0 is targeting the country 's new middle class and chief executive @entity41 told @entity42 he was confident he could convince people to spend between £ 5,400 and £ 27,000 on the @entity2 favourite			1
the launch was announced in 2012 , but due to @entity6 ’s unfamiliarity with ovens and laws about accreditation for them , it was derailed			2
accreditation rules have been re-drafted by authorities and now , three years later , @entity53 are finally available to order			0
mr @entity41 , speaking in @entity55 ahead of the official launch event , conceded that the cookers could just become popular with a ‘ small niche market connecting with expats in @entity6 ’			1
however , he said that it was worth the risk because if they prove popular with the country ’s 1.35 billion population it will be a ‘ game changer ’ for the firm			0
‘ we ’re quietly confident , and that comes from talking to people in the industry as well as consumers , ’ he said			0
‘ the answer to whether it ’ll work seems to be , “ it ’s definitely worth a go ”			0
but nobody is saying this is definitely going to work			0
’ @entity0 products are synonymous with cosy comfort food such as sunday roasts and @entity78 sponges			1
the @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and even @entity82 , who was dropped by the @entity83 this week , own one			0
despite the company 's rich @entity2 history , it has teamed up with @entity6 - based firm @entity87 for the rollout and mr @entity41 said he ’s hoping that families in @entity6 will use the cookers to make traditional @entity15 food			1
@entity0 chief executive @entity41 ( pictured ) denied that succeeding in @entity6 was essential for the company but added : ‘ we want to win some away games ' cooker model : @entity2 fashion model @entity97 was enlisted to advertise the popular cooker , which has not launched in @entity99 as such , the @entity0 models being launched in @entity6 resemble those available in @entity2 but with a crucial difference : a wok burner on top			1
@entity6 ’s new moneyed middle class has a huge appetite for western luxury brands , from @entity109 clothes to @entity110			2
@entity24 , @entity0 ’s director of business development in @entity6 , told @entity42 that shifting eating habits among the country ’s rich also influenced the company ’s decision to launch there			1
‘ five years ago in @entity6 , when people got money they just dined out in expensive restaurants , ’ he said			2
‘ but affluent people have started cooking at home more , showing off to friends , saying : “ i can cook ”			0
we ’ve seen a rise in cooking schools and sales of cooking magazines			0
’ @entity131 - winning physicist dr @entity130 invented the world 's first heat - storage cooker in 1922			0
after a failed experiment cost him his sight , the doting husband wanted to make a better appliance for his wife @entity138			0
according to the @entity0 website , dr @entity130 created a cast - iron cooker capable of every kind of cooking simultaneously , with two large hotplates and two ovens			1
the @entity0 was invented and by 1929 , manufacturing was underway at the @entity148 factory in @entity149			2
agas are now made at the company 's @entity152 foundry in @entity154 and are still made by pouring molten iron into moulds			0
however the modern cookers contain state - of - the - art technology			0
@entity0 's history dates back to 1929			2
this picture , taken in 1968 , shows two children at the @entity162 can you really do every kind of cooking that there is ? this advert was published in a 1955 edition of @entity168 a cascade of recent high - profile food safety scandals in @entity6 has also contributed to a rise in home cooking , as confidence in restaurant standards has dropped			1
although @entity0 sales were up in 2014 in the @entity2 , the company is reaching near saturation point in the country – after all , you ’re only likely to buy an @entity0 once			1
last year the company , which produced its millionth @entity182 cooker this month , released a slimline @entity184 model aimed at @entity2 city dwellers in an attempt to find new buyers			1
mr @entity41 denied that succeeding in @entity6 was essential for the company but added : ‘ we want to win some away games			2
' @entity6 and @entity192 , where we ’re also expanding , are fascinating because they ’re outside of our comfort zone			2
’ consumer analyst @entity195 recently told the @entity196 : ‘ in @entity6 , if you have the kind of money to spend on an @entity0 , you generally have someone who cooks for you			1
’ but mr @entity24 and mr @entity41 said that the @entity0 is billed as a family - orientated product and this would chime well in the country			2
the @entity0 models being launched in @entity6 resemble those available in @entity2 but with a crucial difference : a wok burner on top @entity2 : @entity0 has been selling these popular ovens in @entity2 since 1929 but hopes to break into the @entity99 market ‘ now , in @entity6 , the generation that earns money does n’t just leave behind their parents , ’ mr @entity24 said			1
‘ they bring them back home			0
so we see families with one kid , two kids , together with grandparents , and @entity15 love family gatherings			2
’ another potential pitfall for the @entity0 is the risk of copycat manufacturers ripping them off and undercutting them			0
trademark , copyright and patent abuse in @entity6 is often flagrant , and it seems inevitable that if @entity0 takes off , knock - off products with similar names will start popping up			1
‘ we ’re just going to concentrate on pushing our brand really hard , ’ said mr @entity41			0
‘ we know those stories [ of rip - off products ] are a concern for everyone , but you ’ve got to go with what you know			0
this brand has stood for 90 years because it stands for something			0
’ while it ’s hugely ambitious to try to get a generation of @entity15 to ditch cooking traditions that stretch back generations , mr @entity41 said that if the gamble pays off , he ’ll set his sites on conquering the rest of @entity99			2
‘ @entity6 could be an entry point to @entity99 , ’ he said			0
‘ if it works here it ’d obviously follow on to look at other markets here			0

@entity2 manufacturer @entity0 has launched a cooker with wok burner in @entity6
taking leap into new market is arguably the biggest gamble made by firm
most @entity15 kitchens have two hobs and an oven the size of a microwave
chief executive hopes families will use it to make traditional @entity15 food
