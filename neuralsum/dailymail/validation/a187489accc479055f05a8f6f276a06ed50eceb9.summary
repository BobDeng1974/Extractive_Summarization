a documentary maker who embarked on a high - sugar diet for 60 days to demonstrate the dramatic effect of sugar on the body has weighed into the debate about controversial new coke product , ' @entity7 '			1
health experts have accused @entity9 of ‘ health washing ’ consumers with the launch of its new ‘ lower - calorie ’ soft drink as it still contains the full amount of an adult ’s recommended daily allowance of sugar			1
@entity19 spent two months eating so - called ' healthy ' foods such as juice , cereal and sports drinks for a documentary called that @entity25 - exposing the prevalence of ' hidden sugars '			1
@entity28 actor @entity19 reintroduced sugar into his diet after three years with shocking results @entity7 ( left ) comes in a green can and although it has less sugar than regular @entity7 ( right ) it still contains six teaspoons of sugar dr @entity35 highlighted research carried out in the eighties where rats were given a sugar solution , a saccharin [ artificial sweetener ] solution and only drank a certain amount			1
but when the rats were given both sugar and saccharin mixed together they drank more than they normally would			0
‘ it ’s called a super mix , a little bit of sugar and sweetener drives over consumption … if this translates to the human population then that is fantastic for @entity7 ’s profit line , ’ dr @entity35 said			1
@entity7 has its very own ‘ super mix ’ of both sugar and @entity61 - a type of sweetener			1
‘ @entity7 will be pushing more products but we will be doing more detriment to our health , ’ dr @entity35 warned			1
when it comes to the green colour of the @entity7 packet it can give off a ‘ healthy vibe ’ , dr @entity35 said			1
he noted @entity7 would have done a great amount of market research before they launched the product			1
@entity78 launched @entity7 - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - back in @entity83 in september in documentary ' @entity85 ' he aims to highlight the sugars that are often hidden in ' health ' foods ‘ there would have been some work that went into the association of green with health			1
i can understand how on some superficial level at least that it is seen as a healthier product			0
‘ but people should be aware that a sugar sweetened beverage is still an excessive calorie product with no nutritional benefits , ’ he said			1
dr @entity35 explained that ‘ liquid calories ’ are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food			2
‘ if you are looking to improve health the very first step is to remove your liquid calories , ’ dr @entity35 said			2
the best drinks to consume are water and milk , he advised			0
and when it comes to @entity7 ’s claims that they are trying to help battle the obesity epidemic , dr @entity35 said it is ‘ disingenuous , duplicitous and highly inappropriate for @entity7 to frame their products as healthy			1
’ dr @entity35 said it is ' disingenuous , duplicitous and highly inappropriate ' for @entity7 products to be marketed as healthy @entity7 uses a mix of sugar and natural plant @entity61 , which has been in @entity129 as a sweetener for over 30 years sugary drinks do not just cause weight gain they rot teeth , increase fat on the liver and fat around the waist , he explained ‘ i think it is deceitful and they are sitting there saying the only health worry is weight , which is absolutely wrong			1
’ dr @entity35 explained that ' liquid calories ' are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food professor @entity150 of @entity151 , and former chair of the @entity154 's @entity153 , told the @entity155 the launch of @entity7 is an example of ‘ greenwashing ’			1
‘ it reminds me of the stage we were up at 30 years ago when manufacturers were making healthy cigarettes			0
i 'm worried , it 's trying to make a product that 's intrinsically unhealthy , healthy , ’ she said			2
‘ there 's a high risk that many consumers could be confused , thinking that it 's a low - energy option when it 's not			1
’ the product , which hit @entity28 shelves on monday , has more natural ingredients than @entity172 because it does n’t use artificial sweeteners like @entity174			2
@entity175 , @entity7 @entity176 marketing director , said : ‘ @entity7 truly is another example of us keeping in step with consumer demands			1
‘ we ’re confident that the new product is what consumers have been looking for			2
we ’ve achieved the taste you ’d expect from @entity7 with 35 % reduced sugar and kilojoules , compared to @entity7			2
’ ‘ @entity7 is n’t simply a new product from @entity7 – it ’s another great choice for people who want a delicious @entity7 to fit their lifestyle			1
there is a @entity7 option for everyone , ’ she said			2
it is only the fourth drink to be launched in the @entity199 ’s 128 - year history			0
peach flavour @entity200 has over eight teaspoons of sugar , while @entity202 has seven @entity203 which promise to give you ' energy ' have 13 teaspoons of sugar in them the new addition to @entity7 's range of 3,500 beverages , should also not be mistaken for @entity210 , which is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men who do n't like the word ' diet ' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic @entity7			1
@entity7 is roughly inbetween @entity172 and classic @entity7 when it comes to calories – you will still find 27 in a can			2
however , it has 35 per cent less sugar than classic coke because it uses the natural plant @entity61 and sugar as sweeteners , rather than just sugar			1
@entity174 is a man - made sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages			1
the safety of aspartame has been the subject of several political and medical controversies			0
however , the @entity234 concluded in its 2013 re-evaluation that aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure			0
people with the genetic condition phenylketonuria are however told to avoid it			0
@entity210 ( left ) is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men because they are shown to associate ' diet ' drinks with women			1
unlike @entity172 ( right ) , which is completely sugar free , @entity7 still has sugar nutritionist @entity250 from @entity252 said that @entity61 is not known to have any health risks but that does n't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink @entity7			1
' @entity252 would still say that while it 's safe it 's still encouraging people to want to eat sweets			0
@entity61 is the name of the plant from which stevia sweetener ( steviol glycoside ) is obtained			2
you can buy stevia in a powdered form as a sugar substitute that you can add to food and beverages at home – or you may find it in icecream , water - based beverages , brewed soft drinks , plain and flavoured soy beverages			0
it can be used in cooking and baking according to the @entity277 website , excepting that it does not caramelise like sugar			0
it has been used in @entity129 as the main sweetener for over 30 years and safety reviewed by both @entity283 and many other national food standard agencies in other countries e.g the @entity234 and @entity286			0
@entity283 has concluded that the use of steviol glycosides at proposed levels does not raise any public health and safety concerns			0
' the problem with all these artificial drinks is they still have high acidity levels and dental erosion			0
' the other thing is there is some research that suggests that cola based colour drinks , whether sweetened naturally or artificially , are potentially impact negatively on insulin resistance meaning you are more likely to gain weight , ' she told @entity305			0
' it is not proven or definite but there is some concern around it			0
no matter what , the best drink is water and that ’s we ’d still agree			0
' if you ’re wondering what the need for another low - calorie @entity7 drink is , the global brand which is worth an estimated $ 74 billion @entity315 dollars reportedly wanted a product for the growing number of people who are worried about artificial sweeteners like @entity174 , one of the most intensively scrutinised food additives			1
@entity174 is ingested every day by millions of people around the world in more than 6,000 well - known brands of food , drink and medicine			0
however , it has been the subject of a number of studies that appear to show harmful effects on human health			0
one study linked diet drinks containing @entity174 to premature births , while another suggested it could cause cancer			0
however , in december 2013 , the @entity234 ( @entity234 ) reviewed aspartame and confirmed it as safe , so @entity7 has continued to use it			0
@entity345 has over eight teaspoons of sugar and @entity347 has nine teaspoons @entity7 does not contain @entity174 so may be seen as healthier – but it does contain more sugar than @entity172			2
' i guess with the other artificial sweeteners there is not a lot of evidence unless they are in very high doses that they are harmful			0
but because research has n’t been done checking @entity61 it seems to be quiet safe in those respects , ’ ms @entity357 said			0
@entity7 is meant to taste similar to classic @entity7 but some have noted a slightly aniseed taste to the beverage			2
rival soft drink brand pepsi have also brought out a drink that uses @entity61 as a sweetener in some markets			2
they have named it @entity370 .			0

a *330ml* can of @entity7 still has *22g* of sugar and *89* calories
