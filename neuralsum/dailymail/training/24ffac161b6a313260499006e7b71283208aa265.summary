by @entity1 reporter published : 11:45 est , 3 august 2012 updated : 17:04 est , 3 august 2012 a photo circulating online is claiming to show that 15 @entity4 officials racked up a £ 44,660 bill for a business lunch - including a staggering £ 19,000 on one bottle of @entity9 cognac			2
the service charge for the meal - apparently enjoyed at a restaurant in @entity14 's exclusive @entity13 - came to £ 4962.26 alone			1
the partial view of the bill shows relatively modestly - priced dishes - such as portions of spiced chicken for £ 15 apiece , vegetarian fried rice for £ 5 and sorbet platters at £ 7 a time - alongside the costly cognac			0
the receipt : this was the image posted on @entity26 of a lunch bill allegedly run up by 15 @entity4 officials the extravagant lunch may have been enjoyed at the @entity31 restaurant ( above ) at @entity13 on @entity14 's @entity32 , according to website @entity33			1
the cocktail menu there does indeed offer a 35cl bottle of @entity39 cognac for £ 19,000 ( file photo ) the receipt was posted on social media site @entity26 by a user who claimed to know a worker at the unnamed restaurant			1
it was then reported on @entity48 news site @entity46 with an appeal for more details about the pricey meal			0
a further report by @entity48 website @entity33 suggested that the extravagant lunch had been enjoyed at the @entity31 restaurant at @entity13 on @entity14 's @entity32 , where the cocktail menu offers a 35cl bottle of @entity9 cognac for £ 19,000			1
@entity57 approached @entity31 but the restaurant responded : ' no comment '			0
and @entity57 's calls to @entity61 , the organising committee for @entity62 , have gone unreturned			0
the man 's @entity26 account has since been closed , but when posting the picture he wrote mischievously : ' my friend 's a waiter and this is a receipt for an official lunch for 15 @entity70 in @entity14			2
' now we see where all the money 's going			0
' the person who first posted the receipt online claimed to know a worker at the unnamed restaurant , believed to be at the @entity13 ( above ) a giant set of @entity4 rings stands in the @entity4 village a bottle of @entity83 cognac sold for £ 956 at @entity85 's auction house in september 2004			1
@entity33 's @entity86 said : ' we called the restaurant to see if it had hosted a 15 - person @entity4 luncheon ; the hostess told us that it " probably " had — apparently @entity4 officials have been in and out of the restaurant over the last few weeks — but she could n't specifically confirm this one			2
' so we do n't know for sure that it was , as some @entity26 commenters suggest , a group of @entity4 bureaucrats spending taxpayer money on an obscenely priced bottle of @entity9 ( taxpayer money does n't directly fund the @entity4 , but taxpayers are generally left to foot the bill for the large indirect costs )			0
