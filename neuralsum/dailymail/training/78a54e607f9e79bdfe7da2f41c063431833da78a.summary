by @entity0 twisting her skirt nervously in her hands , it is clear that life for @entity5 , from northern @entity6 , has n't been easy - and that talking about it is harder still			1
aged 11 , she doused herself in petrol and set herself ablaze in a bid to avoid an arranged marriage to a man more than 20 years her senior			1
now 36 , she remains terribly scarred and was forced to flee to @entity12 to escape her father - a man so violent he beat his daughter in hospital as she recovered from her burns			1
' the people who should have loved me did not protect me			1
they hurt me for life			2
' growing up in a remote village , @entity5 says her childhood was a relatively happy one although she , her mother and her three brothers were all terrified of the family patriarch			1
' my mother was my father ’s fourth wife , ' she explains			2
' he did n't have children with his other wives			2
my mother told me that all three of his previous wives ran away because he beat them			2
' and his all too busy fists were n't just directed at his wife			2
' i remember once he tied my hands and feet with rope to a piece of wood and he and my mother beat me with another piece of wood , ' she remembers			2
' they were angry with me because i had gone to the gate at the front of our house to watch a wedding procession and they did not like the families holding the wedding			2
' despite the violence , @entity5 says she was a happy child who enjoyed her studies at the village school and loved playing with her brothers			1
scarred : @entity5 was badly scarred by her suicide attempt and was reluctant to be photographed as a result shocking : @entity5 's friend @entity63 was , like this girl , aged just nine years old when she died the area she grew up in , close to the city of @entity67 , was , she says , ' beautiful ' and she had plenty of friends with whom to enjoy it , among them a girl named @entity63			1
with both of her parents working in the fields , @entity5 was expected to take on the bulk of household chores and shared cooking duties with her mother			1
but the peace of her childhood was about to come to an end when @entity63 , then just nine years old , was asked for by a much older man			1
' she was very beautiful and tall , ' remembers @entity5 , her voice cracking slightly and tears welling up in her eyes			1
' desperate to escape the marriage being forced upon her , @entity63 resorted to extreme measures			1
' she burnt herself , ' whispers @entity5			1
' @entity63 's death would prove to have chilling consequences for her friend			2
less than a year after her friend 's suicide , @entity5 's father announced that she too had been found a husband - despite the fact his daughter was just 11 years old			1
' my mother came to me at home and told me that the next afternoon a man would come and ask me for my hand in marriage , ' she explains			1
' i asked her who it was and she told me the name of a man who lived in our village , who was married and had two children			2
i was only 11 years old and he was 35			2
' i was crying , ' she says as tears well up in her eyes once more			2
' i told my mother that he already had a wife and children			0
' i said i was only 11 years old			2
i told her i wanted to be a teacher , because i loved my teacher			0
but she insisted that i would get married to this man			2
' the girl ran to her teacher , hoping for help , but was told nothing could be done			0
@entity5 then ran to hide in the mountains but , fearful of being eaten by a wolf , returned home and hid in an outbuilding			1
' my parents found me and assumed that because i had returned home i was agreeing to the wedding , ' she says			0
remote : @entity5 grew up in this remote part of northern @entity6 , the child of a farmer and his wife home : @entity5 's family live in a village near the city of @entity67 in north western @entity6 1			1
@entity159 source : @entity161 ' i still could n’t really believe that it was actually true , that it was going to happen			0
but when i saw my family preparing food and setting out tables , i knew really it was going to happen			0
' desperate to avoid marriage and with her friend @entity63 's example in mind , @entity5 ran into the kitchen , took out a bottle of paraffin , doused herself in the contents and set herself ablaze			1
' i was panicking , ' she explains			0
' i just wanted to escape so i tried to kill myself			0
my father had lots of weapons and i considered using them but i chose fire because i was following what my friend @entity63 had done			2
' i poured some paraffin on my skirt and i lit a match			0
when i saw the fire , it was intense and very real			0
i tried to put the fire out with my hands			0
' i tried to get out but i had shut the door and it was difficult			0
the flame was raging and was burning my face			0
' i could see flames in my hair			0
i managed to get out into the courtyard			0
a neighbour was on the flat roof next door			0
he saw me and jumped down			0
i do n’t know what happened after that			0
' @entity5 spent the next three months unconscious in hospital in @entity67 , although even that was n't enough to spare her from the wrath of her father who was furious that his plans had been foiled and fearful for the family honour			1
' i was screaming constantly every day , ' she remembers of the months that followed			0
' i had open skin when they changed the bandages			0
' on top of that my father beat me for what i had done whilst i was at the hospital			1
also once i wet myself and my mother punched me in the face			0
they were so angry with me			0
' when @entity5 left hospital , it was to return to her parents ' house after her former fiance rejected her because , as she reveals , he now saw her as ' dirty ' and ' ugly '			1
at home , things went from bad to worse with her father becoming increasingly aggressive and even telling her that he wished she was dead			2
at risk : @entity5 says she and other scarred women were attacked with stones and shunned in @entity6 help : @entity5 eventually fled to the @entity6 capital @entity235 where she was taken in by a kindly surgeon source : @entity238 ' my father was very aggressive , ' she remembers			1
' he told me i shamed the family and he was embarrassed because of how i looked			0
' i overheard my father saying he wanted me to be taken to a hospital and killed with an injection			1
' unable to bear the abuse , @entity5 , by then aged 13 , stole some money from her parents and escaped to @entity235 where she went straight to hospital			1
a plastic surgeon there took pity on the child , eventually helping her to escape @entity6 and her violent father for good			1
now living in @entity12 , @entity5 remains terribly scarred but is starting to move on with her life , helped by the @entity6 and @entity254			1
her family , however , remain in @entity6 and she has n't spoken to them for more than 20 years			1
' it was dangerous for me to stay in @entity6 , ' she adds			1
' as burnt , scarred woman , i was vilified			0
they insulted me , pulled at my clothing and children threw stones at me			2
i had to run away			0
' in @entity12 , at least , she has found some measure of acceptance and says she would even contemplate a relationship , even though her view of men remains coloured by her father 's behaviour			2
' i was so surprised when i first arrived [ in @entity12 ] because people did not point at me or throw stones at me , ' she remembers			1
' it was such a relief			0
' since being here , i have been trying to come to terms with what happened to me			0
i want to study , which i did n’t have the chance to before			0
' then i want to help girls and women at risk of early and forced marriage , so they do n’t end up like me			1
' as for her family , @entity5 says she will never contact them and never wants to see @entity6 again			1
' i can never return , ' she continues			0
' i ca n’t bear to			0
everything bad that has happened to me happened there			0
i could not have a moment of peace there			0
even thinking of @entity6 means i can not even have peace			1
' the @entity6 and @entity254 @entity254 helps @entity292 women affected by honour violence and campaigns against @entity295			1
