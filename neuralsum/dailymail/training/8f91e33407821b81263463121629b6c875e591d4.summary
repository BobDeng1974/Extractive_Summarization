they are often the subject of ridicule and laughter among females - the whinging , whining men who are forever complaining about having a cold			0
but new research has shown that man flu is not a myth , as a lack of female sex hormones actually leaves males with weaker immune systems			1
scientists from @entity16 believe that a lack of oestrogen makes men more likely to succumb to pneumonia and other respiratory diseases			1
professor @entity36 , of the university 's @entity37 , found females were naturally more resistant to the condition			2
their increased resistance was linked to the enzyme nitric oxide synthase 3 ( @entity43 ) - activated by the release of the female sex hormone oestrogen			1
scientists then took another set of male and female mice and removed the gene responsible for the production of @entity43			2
they found that deleting this gene meant that the female mice were no longer more resistant to infection			2
by administering a simple dose of oestrogen to both males and females , they were able to cure both of serious lung infections - clearing the bacteria from their lungs far more rapidly than normal mice			1
the team hopes that , in the future , this knowledge could be used to enhance resistance to common and serious lung infections and prevent flu developing into more serious pneumonia			1
professor @entity36 said : ' ultimately , this work could be especially useful in reducing risk of secondary bacterial pneumonias during seasonal or pandemic influenza			0
' we were quite pleased that the work led us to nos3 - targeting drugs that are already available and that can indeed improve resistance to pneumonia in our mouse model			0
' the @entity16 study is not the first to provide evidence offering an explanation for man flu			1
research conducted at @entity86 last year suggested that men suffer more with coughs and colds because they have extra temperature receptors in the brain and so experience worse symptoms			0
and dismissing the idea that males are prone to whinging when they are sick , a 2013 survey suggested that it is in fact women who are more likely to complain about having flu symptoms			0
researchers from the @entity100 found that on average , males would play down illness more than females .			0

@entity16 scientists conducted ' man flu ' study using mice
found female sex hormone oestrogen helped fight off respiratory infections
when male mice were given dose of the hormone it *boosted* immune system
it 's hoped results could be used to enhance resistance to common and serious lung infections
