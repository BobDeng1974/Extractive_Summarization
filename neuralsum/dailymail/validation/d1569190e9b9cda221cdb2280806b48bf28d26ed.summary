the latest twist in the alleged cover - up of former secretary of state @entity3 's private emails involves a former senior diplomat who said @entity7 officials conspired to prevent investigators from seeing documents related to the 2012 @entity12 , @entity11 terror attack			1
some of those documents may have been emails that went through the now - infamous private email server @entity16 kept at her @entity17 , @entity19 home			1
if they still exist , they could shed light on @entity16 's actions following the deadly @entity12 raid by militants acting with @entity26 , an @entity27 terror faction linked to @entity28			1
ambassador @entity29 and three security personnel perished in a hail of gunfire , grenades and mortars			0
@entity37 claimed he was scapegoated for objecting to the secret boiler - room operation , which he said was organized in order to keep damning documents from the prying eyes of an internal @entity72			1
on a weekend in a basement room , @entity37 recalled to @entity60 journalist @entity75 , employees were instructed to sift through boxes of documents and separate out anything that might make @entity16 or her close associates look bad in the wake of the terrorist murders of four @entity41 including the ambassador to @entity11			2
' i was not invited to that after - hours endeavor , but i heard about it and decided to check it out on a sunday afternoon , ' @entity37 said			0
inside , says @entity37 , employees – including an employee who reported to him – were busily covering up information that suggested higher - ups were responsible for the lax security at the @entity41 diplomatic outpost in @entity12 , @entity11			0
@entity94 ? the image of @entity16 working her @entity96 while on a plane en route to @entity100 , @entity11 took on new significance with her admission that she never used a ' state.gov ' email account , one that would have automatically archived all her correspondence @entity37 claimed @entity7 higher - ups close to then - secretary @entity3 worked over a weekend to scrub boxes of documents , before giving the remainder to investigators a senior adviserto @entity16 's office explained the operation to him			1
' she told me , " @entity115 , we are to go through these stacks and pull out anything that might put anybody in the [ @entity119 ] front office or the seventh floor in a bad light " , ' @entity37 remembered			0
the seventh floor of the @entity7 is the showplace level that houses @entity16 's office and those of her closest aides			2
' i asked her , " but is n’t that unethical ? " @entity37 said			0
' she responded , " @entity115 , those are our orders " , ' minutes later , he said , @entity43 came into the room and demanded to know , ' who are you ? ' ultimate insider : @entity43 has been part of the @entity16 inner circle since the 1990s , defending @entity16 against impeachment proceedings and even the ' bimbo eruptions ' that once threatened to derail the famous womanizer 's presidential ambitions a month after the deadly military - style assault , the @entity72 's leaders demanded to see documents that could help explain what happened			1
top officials in the of the @entity7 ’s @entity148 were instructed to gather anything and everything that could help			0
those were the documents , @entity37 told @entity152 , that were boxed up and put in the basement room where @entity16 insiders would later screen out the most damaging information before giving the @entity72 the rest			1
the current controversy over @entity16 's emails – she exclusively used a private address instead of one hosted at ' state.gov ' – now suggests that emails to and from @entity16 may have been among them			2
@entity16 conceded last week that she deleted more than 30,000 of those emails , calling them ' personal ' and not ' work - related			1
' her attorney claimed sunday that every deleted email was reviewed by someone			0
@entity171 rep. @entity170 , who chairs a special congressional committee tasked with investigating the @entity12 attacks , insists that @entity16 and her inner circle ca n't be trusted to vet the material on their own			2
@entity178 linked the @entity37 episode with @entity16 's ' email-gate ' on monday , noting that @entity43 – along with @entity16 deputy chief of staff @entity181 – had email addresses on @entity16 's private server			1
devil horns : @entity3 's reputation has taken a hit over her handling of emails during her tenure as @entity41 's top diplomat – leading to more chuckles than outrage at the inadvertent @entity195 treatment on a @entity197 cover @entity170 , a @entity199 @entity198 congressman at the helm of a special @entity12 investigative committee , is outraged that @entity16 and her insiders took it upon themselves to decide which emails were turned over to the @entity7 for archiving @entity37 called the review board investigation ' at best a shoddily executed attempt at damage control , both in @entity209 and on @entity210			1
' @entity7 spokesman @entity211 has called his accusations ' totally without merit			0
' @entity209 is the @entity214 neighborhood that hosts the @entity7 's sprawling headquarters			2
ultimately , @entity7 's review board cleared @entity16 of any wrongdoing , perhaps aided by the absence of incriminating emails – even though it never interviewed her			1
the september 11 attack more than two years ago followed a separate bombing of the facility 's outer wall four months earlier that left a giant hole			0
days later , @entity26 held two days of open - air rallies and parades including 30 fighting battalions in the city 's main square			0
speakers at the event warned of ' assassinations ' that would come			0
@entity16 – the @entity235 's front - runner in the 2016 presidential sweepstakes – and others at @entity7 have been criticized for denying repeated requests from ambassador @entity29 for more security officers , including some that came after these events			1
. @entity26 , the terrorist group that laid waste to the @entity41 diplomatic outpost in @entity12 , held two days of threatening parades and rallies a few months earlier and called for ' assassinations ' -- leading to questions about why security at the compound was lacking @entity37 was one of four officials officially saddled with the blame			0
he was later cleared of wrongdoing			0
he was , however , placed on indefinite leave , with pay , while the @entity7 investigated			0
struggling to clear his name , @entity37 met with an agency ombudsman who he says told him , ' you are taking this all too personally , @entity37			0
... it ’s not about you ; it ’s about @entity3 and 2016			2
' @entity263 president @entity262 , whose organization has dented the @entity267 administration 's @entity12 armor with a series of @entity270 lawsuits , told @entity271 that ' @entity37 ’s disclosures are no surprise to those of us who know the @entity277 ' penchant for illicit secrecy			2
' ' the @entity12 cover - up was and is about protecting two presidential campaigns – @entity267 ’s 2012 reelection campaign and @entity3 ’s nascent 2016 campaign , ' @entity262 said			1
' our ambassador and three other @entity41 personnel die in a terrorist attack and the number one concern at @entity288 is protecting @entity3 ! first we have the supposedly missing @entity290 emails and now we may have missing @entity12 documents ? ' in may 2013 the @entity292 interviewed @entity294 president @entity293 , who said disciplinary action meted out to diplomats like @entity37 creates ' a feeling that foreign - service officers often end up as scapegoats when scandals rise to congressional or public attention			1

an @entity72 demanded documents related to the 2012 @entity12 terror attack but *important* details were kept from them
former deputy assistant secretary said a weekend boiler - room *scramble* ' separated ' papers that might *reflect* badly on @entity3
he was scapegoated , he claims , and told by a @entity7 's ombudsman : ' it ’s not about you ; it ’s about @entity3 and 2016 '
allegations have new *importance* as @entity16 admitted destroying more than 30,000 ' personal ' emails on a private server at her @entity17 , @entity19 house
