by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 27 june 2013 updated : 04:00 est , 28 june 2013 many women will admit that they have been dreaming of the perfect fairytale wedding since they were little girls			0
but some , it seems , are so enamoured by the idea , that they have even gone so far as to purchase any wedding related products they can get their hands on			0
according to the latest research , 11 per cent of single women in the @entity10 have already picked out their wedding @entity12 of these keen women , an additional 37 per cent have even gone as far to already purchase a gown , with no proposal on the horizon			1
now that 's keen ! one in 10 single @entity10 women have already chosen their wedding dress , even though they do n't even have a partner yet and it is n't just the perfect dress that avid brides - to - be are dreaming up			1
59 per cent have already planned other elements of their big day , such as make - up , bridesmaids and a venue , despite not having any immediate plans to marry			2
and only 41 per cent of respondents who had planned elements of their wedding day admitted that they had told a prospective partner about their plans , whilst 36 per cent claimed that their wedding plans had scared members of the opposite sex in the past			1
furthermore , a canny 34 per cent of respondents admitted that they had already started saving towards their wedding ; 76 per cent of which claimed that they already had a budget in mind			0
@entity45 : of these keen women who have already chosen a wedding dress , an additional 37 per cent have even gone as far to already purchase it a spokesman for @entity49 , who carried out the survey , said : ' whilst i have heard of people who have had some ideas about their wedding day , i have never heard of any who have purchased a wedding dress despite no plans to get married in the near future ; but it seems that the majority who have keep it a secret , so this is probably why ! ' whilst it is good forward planning , parting with a lot of money for something you do n’t need there and then is never advised - particularly as you might change your mind when the big day comes around			1
' planning a wedding can be expensive and if you do not have to spend the money right away , what is the rush ? ' the best bet is to wait until you have decided what type of wedding day you and your prospective partner would like to have			2
' @entity81 , wedding style consultant for @entity83 , added : ' i think if you know what suits your body shape and you fall in love with a wedding dress on first site , it 's quite safe to assume you will still love the dress when your wedding day arrives			2
' i have brides who want me to work on their dress selection with them over a year before the big day and only once has the bride not gone with her original choice			0
