by @entity0 as the height of summer approaches , many beachgoers may not realise that a hidden threat lies in the sand and water			2
seagull droppings have been linked to rising levels of @entity10 bacteria found on beaches , and to solve the problem a team of scientists have turned to an unusual source - border collies			1
last summer , the dogs were employed to walk up and down the beaches in @entity19 to chase the gulls away , and following tests , bacteria levels were found to have ‘ significantly ’ dropped			1

to reduce the risk to beachgoers , @entity19 scientists are using patrol dogs			1
the border collies , pictured , walk up and down the beaches chasing gulls away and following tests , @entity10 levels were found to have ' significantly ' dropped @entity10 , also known as @entity10 , is the name of a germ , or bacterium , that lives in the digestive tracts of humans and animals			1
there are many types of @entity10 , and most of them are harmless			0
but some can cause bloody diarrhoea , while others , in particular a strain called @entity47 : @entity49 , may also cause severe anaemia or kidney failure			0
there are also strains of @entity10 that cause urinary tract infections			0
people can get an e. coli infection by coming into contact with the faeces of humans or animals			0
this can happen by drinking or eating contaminated food			0
source : @entity63 researchers from @entity65 reported the findings at the annual meeting of the @entity68			0
@entity70 faeces was named as one source of the bacteria , which in recent years has led to beaches being closed and people advised not to swim			0
in addition , gull droppings may contain other bacteria that have the potential to cause human disease , according to researcher @entity80 at the beginning of last summer , 656ft ( 200 - metre ) sections of beach were assigned to be either dog - treated beaches , or control beaches			2
half way through the summer , the beach sections were swapped - so the dogs were moved to the control beaches and the previous ‘ dog beaches ’ were left untreated			2
during the summers of 2012 and 2013 , researchers recorded the number of gulls at each beach section			0
during the dog tests , samples of beach water and beach sand were collected once a week , and the numbers of @entity10 in the samples was counted			1
in early summer , samples from beaches where dogs had been used to get rid of the gulls had significantly lower e. coli counts compared to control beaches			2
‘ border collies are intelligent dogs that love to work and could be used by beach managers as part of a comprehensive management strategy to reduce bacterial contamination at public beaches , ’ said @entity80 at the beginning of last summer , sections of beach were arbitrarily assigned to be dog - treated beaches , or control beaches			1
