by @entity0 published : 10:15 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 12:11 est , 4 september 2012 a leading economist has thrown the popular ' @entity3 ' theory into doubt , suggesting that the research behind it is based on ' over-generalised gender stereotypes '			1
the well - known phenomenon suggests that women buy less - expensive luxury goods , such as cosmetics , in tough economic times in a bid to increase their attractiveness to mates			1
but now @entity16 , from the @entity17 , @entity18 , has stated that the ' overly general ' findings only serve to reinforce ' stereotypes about women 's lives - and social value - centering on questions of their attractiveness to men			1
' finishing touch : an economist has questioned the so - called ' lipstick effect ' suggesting that it has less to do with human nature and more with over-generalising gender stereotypes she told @entity33 that the theory is ' a gross over-generalization ' adding that recent studies aiming to give it scientific status came from a narrow sub-class of women - young university students within the @entity42 also that the phenomenon only applies to ' women who reported themselves to be highly motivated to attract a male romantic partner , but not among young women with low motivation '			1
she added : ' along with young women not looking for a partner , it is not at all clear that older women , married women , lesbian women , or women from other educational and cultural backgrounds would share this so - called ' women 's psychology			2
' opposition : @entity16 , from the @entity17 , @entity18 , has thrown the popular ' @entity3 ' theory into doubt @entity62 said it is ' plausible ' that the purchase of beauty products and make - up is an evolutionary outcome of competition for mates , but it ' is a far cry from it being scientifically demonstrated			1
' she pointed out the study 's results suggest that maintaining one 's appearance in the face of adversity , might be a stronger motivation than the desire to attract a mate and it would be valuable to repeat similar research with older married women			2
in the paper boosting beauty in an @entity85 : @entity86 , and the @entity3 , which was published last month researchers from @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 at @entity91 and @entity92 , presented five studies			0
following evolutionary theories , @entity94 , co-author of the study said : ' we may not consciously think we ’re buying them to make ourselves more desirable to men			0
' but our lizard brains go after these things even when we think we ’re too smart to be lured in by manipulative advertising claims like , ‘ these jeans will help get you a man			0
’ for the study 154 university students including 82 women and 72 men were presented with fictitious articles highlighting the recession			0
the participants were then asked if the content caused them to think there were fewer physically attractive suitors available with a steady job and income and the majority answered ' yes '			0
the participants were then asked , based on their gender , about their desire to purchase six products			2
three products enhanced physical appearance including two fashion items and a lipstick for women and facial cream for men			0
the other three products were a wireless mouse , stapler and headphones			0
while men 's purchasing desires were not effected , women in the recession condition demonstrated a ' significant interaction between priming condition and product type ' opting for products that would enhance their appearance			2
defending the findings @entity144 , one of the co-authors of the paper from the @entity89 argued that the work was ' grounded in theory about universal human nature rather than cultural stereotypes ' , although he admitted that further research is needed .			1

leading economist @entity16 says theory reinforces gender stereotypes
phenomenon still ' a far cry from being scientifically demonstrated '
