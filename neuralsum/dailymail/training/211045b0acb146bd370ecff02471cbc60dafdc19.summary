if you ’re the type of person who drives around looking for a space big enough for your not - quite parallel parking skills , then help may be at hand			0
a robot named ‘ @entity7 ’ has been developed to help spatially - challenged drivers fit into tight spaces by automatically parking their car for them			1
the technology , currently being used at @entity12 , claims to be able to park 60 per cent more vehicles in one area compared to a human driver			1
a driver leaves their car at a @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , which uses laser scanners to measure the precise height and width of the vehicle			1
the system then calculates the position of the vehicle ’s wheels and measures other key parts such as the wing mirrors and the bumper			2
once this is done , the driver is issued with a ticket from a terminal where they can leave their vehicle in @entity7 ’s mechanical ' hands '			1

the technology , currently being used at @entity12 , claims to be able to park 60 per cent more vehicles in one area compared with a human driver the system calculates the position of the vehicle ’s wheels and measures other key parts such as the wing mirrors and the bumper ( right )			1
once this is done , the driver is issued with a ticket from a terminal where they can leave their vehicle in @entity7 ’s hands ( left ) @entity7 has four wheels that can turn a full 360 - degrees , allowing it to manoeuvre into extremely tight spaces			1
approaching from the side , @entity7 picks up the car by sliding one set of its forks each under its front and rear wheels			2
the car is then transported to the parking spot selected by the system ’s software			1
when a driver wants their car back , they pay the ticket and their vehicle will be brought to a nearby @entity71			1
the technology has been developed by @entity74 transport systems , a company based in @entity76 , alongside the @entity77 in @entity78			0
automated parking systems are nothing new , but @entity81 company says its product is more efficient			2

the car is then transported to the parking spot selected by the system ’s software software divides up the area to make sure cars make the best possible space , for example by parking cars of a similar size together			1
@entity7 can reshuffle the arrangement of cars at any time if it realised that a different arrangement would make more efficient use of the space			0
the system is already being used in the parking of @entity12 alongside a smartphone app that tells drivers if their car is ready to be collected			1
‘ this technology is especially handy during peak times , ’ dr @entity110 , managing director of @entity111 told @entity77 magazine			0
‘ instead of spending millions of euros to extend our garages , we could simply make better use of the space we already have			0
’ it ’s happened to all of us : faced with a busy car park , you suddenly have a sinking feeling that you have no idea where you have left your car			0
but instead of wandering the endless rows of identical vehicles , you can now let your smartphone track down your ride with a simple push of the button			0
@entity133 recently announced that smartphones using its @entity136 service will be offering something known as a ‘ parking detector ’ the intelligent personal assistant , available within the @entity141 mobile application for the @entity143 and @entity144 operating systems , lists the address of the place where you last left your car			0
it does this on a @entity136 ‘ parking card ’ on your phone , that also provides a map which shows how far you are from that location			0
if the card gets it wrong the first time , the service will also offer alternative places that you can check .			0

the system is currently being used at @entity12 in @entity81
it claims to be able to park 60 *%* more vehicles in one area than a human
a driver leaves their car at a @entity21 to be measured
@entity7 then scoops vehicle up by placing its forks under each of its wheel
car is then transported to parking spot selected by @entity7 *'s* software
when a driver wants their car back , they pay their parking ticket and their vehicle is brought to a nearby transfer station
