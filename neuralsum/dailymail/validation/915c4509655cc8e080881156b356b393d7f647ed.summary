while @entity2 was using a private email address hosted on her own home - based computer server to conduct @entity7 business , her agency forced out an ambassador who was doing the same thing overseas			1
retired air force general @entity10 was @entity11 ambassador to @entity12 for 13 months between 2011 and 2012 , departing after a scathing performance report blasted his leadership style and determined that he created security risks by running his own one - person it department			1
the report determined that @entity10 ' assumed charge of the mission ’s information management operations , ' in @entity21 , and ' ordered a commercial internet connection installed in his embassy office bathroom so he could work there on a laptop not connected to the @entity7 email system			1
@entity10 , the @entity7 's @entity50 wrote , ' continued to use commercial email for official government business ' even when investigators were digging into his conduct			1
the report noted that he seldom logged on to his official @entity7 email account ; the @entity56 later reported that he ' preferred to use @entity57 for official business			0
' @entity59 , the odds - on favorite to be the @entity63 's presidential nominee in 2016 , came under fire this week for using a private email account – not a @entity7 ' state.gov ' address – to conduct government business			1
her aides , and @entity71 administration colleagues – including @entity73 personnel – reached her at ' hdr22@clintonemail.com ' for the four years she was @entity11 's top diplomat			1

additional questions have swirled around potential national security risks posed by having sensitive material flowing through unsecure channels			0
@entity10 lasted just 13 months as an ambassador before his management style and data security breaches ended his @entity7 career @entity59 helmed the @entity7 through the entirety of @entity10 's tenure as ambassador			1
the @entity7 did not respond to a request for comment about parallels between her case and @entity10 's			0
but the 2012 @entity98 report spelled out a policy that it appears @entity59 herself failed to follow			2
' it is the department 's general policy that normal day - to - day operations be conducted on an authorized information system , which has the proper level of security controls , ' the report read			0
' the use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss , phishing , and spoofing of email accounts , as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information			0
' ' the use of unauthorized information systems can also result in the loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions , ' the inspector general added			0
' conducting official business on non-department automated information systems must be limited to only maintaining communications during emergencies			0
' secure ? @entity11 's embassy in @entity21 , @entity12 where @entity10 had a commercial internet line installed in his office bathroom so he could communicate out of reach of @entity131 @entity59 's emails were never publicly leaked , but some messages sent to her by a close adviser were			1
