however , the latest advice from @entity2 ’s , which has been the social authority on etiquette for almost 250 years , comes with one condition			2
anyone too busy to cook or surprised by the arrival of unexpected guests must always serve food on china plates - and that the plates have been warmed up			1
the new guidance appears in the forthcoming @entity29 to @entity4 and represents a major concession to custom and practice in ‘ polite society			0
