@entity1 defender @entity0 has denied a @entity3 charge of violent conduct for standing on @entity6 goalkeeper @entity5			1
video evidence was used to charge the centre - back , currently away on international duty with @entity10 , after television pictures highlighted the incident - missed by referee @entity13 - in the last seconds of sunday 's 2 - 1 defeat at @entity15			1
@entity0 chased a through - ball as 10 - man @entity1 searched for a late equaliser but @entity17 slid in to get there first and the defender continued his run and stood on the goalkeeper 's right shin			2
@entity0 's foot lands on @entity5 's leg in the incident which saw the @entity3 charge the defender @entity0 will fight the violent conduct charge , claiming the alleged stamp was not intentional @entity28 : @entity29 away , april 4 @entity30 sixth round : @entity32 away , april 8 @entity28 : @entity33 at home , april 13 a three - man panel of former elite officials were asked by the @entity3 to review the footage independently of each other and there was unanimous agreement the offence warranted a red card			1
@entity0 was given until 6pm on tuesday to respond to the charge and has decided to contest it			0
the 30 - year - old will argue the incident was accidental and not intentional			2
if he fails in his challenge , @entity0 will receive a three - match ban - which covers league games at @entity29 and home to @entity33 either side of the @entity30 quarter - final replay at @entity53 side @entity32			0
@entity6 keeper @entity17 takes exception to the contact from @entity0 at the end of sunday 's match a three - man panel of former elite officials reviewed the footage after it was n't seen by @entity13 ( right ) coincidentally , @entity0 could argue a precedent was set back in january when @entity62 striker @entity61 was charged for a stamp on @entity1 's @entity64 but escaped punishment for one on @entity0 himself			1
the @entity68 international stood on the defender as he slid in to make a tackle in a similar incident to @entity0 's coming together with @entity17			2
the incident was looked at retrospectively using television evidence after both the @entity0 flashpoint and the stamp on can were missed by referee @entity76			0
@entity0 could argue a precedent was set in january when @entity62 striker @entity61 escaped punishment for an alleged stamp on him that was reviewed on video after referee @entity76 missed the incident @entity61 was however suspended for this contact with @entity0 's team - mate @entity64 in the same match ' following a review of an incident during the game involving @entity61 and @entity1 's @entity0 , the @entity3 will not be taking any further action , ' a statement from the @entity3 said at the time			1
however , @entity0 's hopes of succeeding appear slim			0
@entity61 appealed his charge for the offence against can - with manager @entity94 insisting both incidents were ' absolutely accidental ' - but was found guilty and banned for three matches			0
it led to @entity94 claiming there was a ' clear campaign ' against @entity62 .			0
