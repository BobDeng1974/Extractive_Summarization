by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 after an inspirational manager lead them to a fine finish at the @entity6 but since left for @entity8 , these could be seen as challenging times for @entity10			1
but morale is still high in the squad under a new boss ahead of the friendly against @entity15			2
here , @entity16 looks at what the @entity17 have to offer in life after @entity20			2
new era : @entity10 prepare for thursday 's friendly with @entity15 with @entity22 at the helm tough act to follow : @entity20 , now of @entity8 , lead the team to a third - place finish in @entity27 so , what 's new ? @entity10 have turned to the steady hands of @entity22 as they look to continue progressing with a talented group of players			1
the vastly experienced boss has enjoyed a 27 - year managerial career , including with national teams @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
he has even taken charge of the @entity10 before , guiding the likes of @entity42 and @entity43 to a @entity6 quarter - final in 1998			1
some believe they would have been deserving winners with their brand of football			0
@entity22 rarely gets things wrong when it comes to coaching a side ( he 's often brought in when club side 's face crisis ) so it 's no wonder he was picked for the job following a low - key spell at @entity57			1
he 's not changing too much , either ... happy to be here : @entity22 is preparing for his first match in charge of his second spell with the @entity10 how things have changed : @entity22 was the @entity17 coach from 1994 to 1998 who 's in , who 's out ? out of the 23 - man squad travelling , only six did n't go to the @entity6			1
@entity66 was due to take part but has since picked up a knock ( he was recalled after missing the trip to @entity27 through injury ) , though @entity72 's @entity71 has been brought back into the fold			0
@entity74 , now of @entity75 , and @entity76 are dropped from the set - up , as is @entity78 , but @entity79 gets a chance to shine again			0
goalkeeper @entity81 , @entity83 's @entity82 , @entity86 ad @entity84 all win call - ups , but all in all @entity22 has n't made any drastic changes in terms of personel , he has simply made changes due to injuries			2
that does n't mean he 's sticking with @entity95 's system , though ... back in business : @entity86 and @entity84 have been recalled so , no more 3 - 5 - 2 ? why fix it when it 's not broken ? i hear you say			1
@entity95 's system , deploying @entity101 as a free - roaming left wing - back worked wonderfully in @entity27 , thrashing @entity103 in the group stages on the way to a third - place finish			1
however , at times of desperation the new @entity8 boss did in fact change things , to 4 - 3 - 3 to be exact			1
and that 's what @entity22 has opted for as he begins his reign			2
' i had a discussion with the important players and we 've decided to go back to 4 - 3 - 3			1
there was no surprise about it , ' said @entity22			2
@entity120 is out of the game in @entity122 but the system would presumably mean a place out on the right - hand side for the winger			1
@entity127 , @entity128 or @entity101 will be the main candidates to partner @entity130 against @entity15			0
@entity132 man : @entity130 will play the no 9 in the new 4 - 3 - 3 system , rather than with a partner in a 3 - 5 - 2 4 - 3 - 3 has been popular for @entity22 over the years			1
when appointed at @entity140 after @entity137 's attempt at introducing @entity138 at @entity139 , @entity22 kept things simple			2
@entity142 on one side , @entity144 on the other , @entity145 through the middle			0
it 's safe to say it worked			0
@entity140 won 11 out of 13 @entity150 games with the @entity17 at the helm			0
@entity22 favoured 4 - 4 - 2 during his first spell with @entity10 and tried out a bizarre 3 - 6 - 1 with @entity37 in 2006 , but there 's no doubt 4 - 3 - 3 is his preferred method			1
more conservative he may be , and you may not be getting the same @entity95 fireworks , but the @entity17 are on the right path for @entity159 and beyond			0
will it get the best out of the star men ? as mentioned above , @entity130 will surely be the lone striker in this system			0
@entity10 have used it in the past with the 30 - year - old impressing , while he scored 31 @entity150 goals as the main man at @entity169			0
@entity170 will still have the freedom to create in his no 10 role , and he should have quick wingers to provide through the flanks			0
in that sense the formation suits the @entity17 perfectly			0
however , one worry could be the defence			0
despite the attacking talent , @entity10 have never really been blessed with world class players at the back , none more so than now			0
passion : @entity120 will operate from the right - hand side , though he is a doubt for the game on thursday blow : @entity188 will miss out in @entity122 , but would probably be second choice behind @entity190 @entity191 is a solid individual and had a superb @entity6 with two centre halves supporting him , but doubts will remain about his suitability in this formation			1
@entity196 is another who had a fine tournament , though it is not yet clear whether he will operate best at left back , midfield or centre back in @entity22 's team			2
he played in all three positions in the @entity6			0
verdict ? it 's hard to improve from a third - place finish in the @entity6 , lead by @entity95 , but @entity10 have hit the jackpot here			1
@entity22 is the perfect man for this job with the same star players you associate wearing the orange shirt			2
the mix of youth and experience should see this side kick on in the next few years .			0

@entity22 took over at @entity10 after third - place finish at @entity6
@entity20 left to take on the manager 's job at @entity8
@entity22 says it was ' no surprise ' to players that the formation has changed
experienced boss will *revert* to 4 - 3 - 3 system , not 3 - 5 - 2
the @entity17 play @entity15 in a friendly in @entity122 on thursday night
