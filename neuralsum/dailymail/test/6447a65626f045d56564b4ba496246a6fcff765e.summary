for @entity1 , the memories of may 11 , 1985 will never fade			1
as @entity2 celebrated promotion from the old @entity4 , a day of joy quickly became one of devastation as a fire ripped through the timber main stand at @entity11 towards the end of the first half , claiming 56 helpless victims			1
just 21 years of age , @entity1 returned to his car , only to find the door handle was burning hot because it had been parked so near to the blaze			1
upon learning his father , @entity20 — one of a large group of @entity1 ’s relatives at the game — had been badly burned and was missing , the young midfielder set off frantically through the streets of @entity2			1
the fire at @entity2 's @entity11 claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on may 11 , 1985 the 30th anniversary is approaching since the tragic fire that killed 56 people at @entity2 's ground in 1985 still wearing his boots and kit , he was finally reunited with his father in @entity35 in @entity36			1
those hours represented the worst of his life but given that other families lost loved ones that day , @entity1 has always declared himself and his father the fortunate ones			1
so how would the @entity45 manager — who donated money from his 2002 testimonial to the @entity2 burns unit that cared for his father and so many others — react to bombshell claims this week that mere bad luck had perhaps played no role in the disaster ? a book written by @entity56 , a @entity2 fan who lost three generations of his family in the blaze , says the incident was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned or associated with the club ’s then chairman @entity64 , in the previous 18 years , resulting in huge insurance claims			1
in his book @entity68 , published on thursday , @entity56 believes the fire was not an accident and says he and his family are no longer willing to ‘ live the myth ’			1
fire engulfs @entity11 on a day nobody can ever forget as 56 were killed at the football stadium a police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the stand on fire from @entity1 ’s annual visits to the club ’s memorial services , he knows @entity56 , who lost brother , @entity86 ( 11 ) — the youngest victim of the tragedy — as well as his father @entity89 ( 34 ) , uncle @entity90 ( 32 ) and grandfather @entity91 ( 63 )			1
he also knows @entity64 and attended the funeral of the ‘ great chairman ’ in 1995			1
to @entity1 , the verdict of inquiry judge sir @entity95 , who declared the fire had probably been started by a stray match , cigarette or pipe tobacco slipping through gaps on the floor on to a build - up of litter , remains the most likely cause of the tragedy			1
‘ i get so caught up in this job managing @entity45 that i do n’t always see the news but someone told me the other day that the @entity2 story had been on @entity110 , ’ said @entity1 on friday			1
‘ and then my missus mentioned it to me later that night when i got home			0
‘ i know the ( @entity56 ) family			2
i go to every memorial that i can and you meet the same people at these things			0
so i know the lad , who was very young at the time ( of the disaster ) , has brought out this book			0
then - @entity2 chairman @entity64 ( left ) with mr @entity123 in front of the burned stand a 12 - year - old @entity56 is comforted by his mother @entity126 in 1985 after the @entity128 disaster ‘ but i also knew @entity64			1
he was a great chairman and , not for one second , do i believe it was deliberate			2
he has passed away now and i was at his funeral			0
‘ but i saw ( sir @entity95 ) @entity95 said the actual stand was n’t even insured , so they did n’t get any money for it anyway			2
for me , that just blows the theory out of the water			0
’ @entity1 , who spent six years from 1982 to 1988 at @entity11 , recalls one of his jobs in his early years was to clean the main stand			1
and he finds it hard to accept any foul play was behind the inferno			0
‘ i used to sweep that stand , ’ he said			2
‘ there were little holes and as you swept up ( bits of rubbish would fall down ) but you never gave a thought to what was underneath			0
but , over the years , all this rubbish has built up and it needed one cigarette			2
it has gone down a gap and then tragedy has struck			0
’ former @entity2 player @entity1 does not believe the fire was anything other than an accident on saturday , @entity1 takes @entity45 to @entity159 where victory would leave the @entity162 side four points ahead with two games remaining			1
should they win , @entity165 , who play @entity167 in the @entity169 semi-final at lunchtime , would travel under pressure on wednesday to face a @entity173 side who are bottom of the table but enjoying a recent resurgence			0
and the @entity162 boss insists he is not overly concerned by statistics which show that @entity45 have just one win in five on the road			0
‘ it ’s all about the result at @entity159			0
it is a game we have to win , simple as that			0
it does n’t matter how we do it			0
it is about the three points			0
@entity1 prepares his players for saturday 's @entity191 clash with @entity192 ‘ i saw a stat that we have won only five games out of 15 , which is true			1
but we have lost one in 12 and won four out of the last six			2
and one of those wins , at @entity165 , was our best performance of the season away from home			0
so you can use stats in different ways			0
’ @entity1 also backed his captain @entity205 , who has been the subject of criticism from @entity45 fans in recent weeks			2
he was red - carded for elbowing @entity210 striker @entity209 and , on his return to the team after a two - match ban , @entity45 dropped two points at @entity215			2
but @entity1 said : ‘ since i ’ve been here , i would say the criticism has been unfair because he has not done a lot wrong			2
he is good in the dressing room and he is an important player for us			0

in 1985 the main stand of @entity2 's @entity11 caught fire , killing 56
@entity225 found the fire had probably started via stray match or cigarette
@entity1 was playing that day and his father was badly burned in the blaze
@entity2 fan @entity56 claims the fire may not have been an accident
@entity56 's father , uncle , brother and grandfather lost their lives in the fire
@entity56 claims chairman @entity64 may have been to blame
but @entity1 *refutes* those claims insisting it was just an accident
