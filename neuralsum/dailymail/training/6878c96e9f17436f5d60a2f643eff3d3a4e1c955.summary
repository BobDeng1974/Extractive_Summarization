by @entity1 reporter published : 11:01 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 12:09 est , 14 june 2013 a @entity4 television ad targeting @entity6 west virginian senator @entity5 for his work with president @entity8 and @entity9 mayor @entity10 to draft new gun control legislation uses a shaded photo of the @entity15 - @entity14 president that makes him appear darker and , according to some critics - like @entity19 's @entity18 - more sinister			1
in the ad , @entity21 's face appears to be shaded , as well , but much less dramatically than the president 's @entity8 's darker appearance in the ad is being compared to a controversial 1994 @entity26 cover that shows a shaded image of former @entity29 running back @entity28 - who , at the time , was on trial for the brutal murders of his ex-wife and another man - that makes his skin seem much darker than it actually is			1
scroll down for watch commercial made in the shade : the @entity4 shaded this photo of president @entity8 to make him appear darker than he actually is notice anything different ? the @entity26 cover came at a time when racial tensions across the @entity14 began heating up as a result of the @entity28 trial , which divided the country along racial lines for a variety of reasons			1
specifically , those skeptical about the state 's case against @entity28 charged that the lead investigator on the case , former @entity53 detective @entity52 , was racist and had planted evidence to frame the @entity58 winner			0
critics contend that the @entity26 cover was racist , and was designed to make @entity28 look more sinister , and - as an @entity15 on trial for murder - guilty			2
others claimed that the altered image was designed to make it appear more dramatic in an effort to sell more copies of the magazine			0
@entity69 : pundits are comparing the @entity4 's ad with this controversial @entity26 cover , where @entity28 's skin is shaded to make him appear darker @entity74 , the managing editor of the magazine when the now - infamous cover was published , later posted an explanation online			1
' it seems to me you could argue that it 's racist to say that blacker is more sinister , but be that as it may : to the extent that this caused offense to anyone , i obviously regret it , ' @entity74 said in his message			0
the @entity4 did not respond to @entity90 's request for comment , nor has it responded to any of the criticism that the ad is racist			2
the @entity4 dropped more than $ 100,000 on the ad , which will start airing in @entity95 in two weeks			2
the ad quotes one of @entity5 's videos from his 2010 @entity99 campaign , in which he says ' as your senator , i 'll protect your second amendment rights			2
' a voiceover in the ad then says , ' that was @entity5 's commitment			0
but now , @entity5 is working with president @entity8 and @entity9 mayor @entity10			0
concerned ? you should be			0
tell sen. @entity5 to honor his commitment to the @entity110 and reject the @entity8 - @entity21 gun control agenda			0
