a sinister airborne surveillance camera gives the @entity2 military the ability to track movements in an entire city like a real - time @entity6			0
the @entity8 array can be mounted on unmanned drones to capture an area of 15 sq / miles in an incredible @entity11 - that 's 225 times more sensitive than an @entity13 camera			1
from 17,500ft the remarkable surveillance system can capture objects as small as 6in on the ground and allows commanders to track movements across an entire battlefield in real time			1
the aerospace and weapons company developed the @entity8 array as part of a $ 18.5million project funded by the @entity42 's @entity41 ( @entity41 )			1
in @entity50 mythology , @entity43 , guardian of the heifer - nymph @entity45 and son of @entity48 , was a primordial giant whose epithet , ' @entity43 ' , ' all - seeing ' , led to his being described with multiple , often one hundred , eyes			0
like the @entity57 of myth , the @entity42 's @entity8 ( a backronym standing for @entity56 @entity55 ) works by stringing together an array of 368 digital camera imaging chips			1
an airborne processor combines the video from these chips to create a single ultra-high definition mosaic video image which updates at up to 15 frames a second			1
all - seeing : this graphic illustrates how the @entity2 military 's argus - is array links together images streamed from hundreds of digital camera sensors to watch over a huge expanse of terrain in real time what it looks like : the @entity8 ( a backronym standing for @entity56 @entity55 ) strings together an array of 368 digital camera imaging chips into a single unit that tremendous level of detail makes it sensitive enough to not only track people moving around on the ground thousands of feet below , but even to see what they are doing or carrying			1
the argus array sends its live feed to the ground where it connects to a touch - screen command room interface			0
using this , operators can zoom in to any area within the camera 's field of view , with up to 65 zoom windows open at once			1
each video window is electronically steerable independent of the others , and can either provide continuous imagery of a fixed area on the ground or be designated to automatically keep a specified target in the window			2
@entity105 : the system tracks all moving objects in its field of view , highlighting them with coloured boxes , allowing operators to track movements across an area as and when they happen the system automatically tracks any moving object it can see , including both vehicles and individuals on foot , highlighting them with coloured boxes so they can be easily identified			1
it also records everything , storing an approximate million terabytes of data a day - the equivalent of 5,000 hours of high - definition video footage			0
' so you can go back and say i 'd like to see what happened at this particular location three days , two hours [ and ] four minutes ago , and it will actually show you what happened as if you were watching it live , ' said mr @entity32			0
ipad next ? the feed from the argus is transmitted to a touch - screen command and control interface windows : operators can open a window to zoom in to any area within the camera 's field of view , with up to 65 open and running at once total surveillance : the view of @entity142 , @entity143 , highlighted in the @entity36 film for the @entity36 programme reporting the technology , mr @entity32 showed reporters a feed over the city of @entity142 , @entity143 , that was recorded in 2009			2
the technology has been in development since 2007 but authorities are staying tight lipped about whether it has yet been deployed on the battlefield			0
dr @entity155 , director of optical sensor systems at @entity33 , said : ' @entity158 - is system overcomes the fundamental limitations of current airborne surveillance systems			2
' very high - resolution imaging systems required for vehicle and dismount tracking typically have a " soda - straw " view that is too small for persistent coverage			0
' existing wide - area systems have either inadequate resolution or require multiple passes or revisits to get updates			0
' @entity33 are now said to be working on an infra - red version of argus that would allow commanders total surveillance of an area even at night .			2

the @entity8 can view an area of 15 sq / miles in a single image
its zoom capability can detect an object as small as 6in on the ground
developed by @entity33 as part of a $ *18million* @entity41 project
