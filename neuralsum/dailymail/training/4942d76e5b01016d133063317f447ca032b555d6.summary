by @entity0 actor @entity1 has denied saying in interview his throat cancer was caused by oral sex , claiming instead he was discussing the causes of cancer			1
the @entity8 actor was recently quoted saying that his throat cancer was caused by the human papilloma virus ( @entity10 ) , a sexually transmitted disease that he contracted after performing oral sex on women			1
a leading sexual health doctor questioned @entity1 ' claim that his throat cancer was caused by oral sex			1
and now the mr @entity1 has retracted his comments			1
the actor 's spokesman @entity17 said that mr @entity1 never said that @entity10 was the cause of his cancer ; he said @entity1 was discussing what causes oral cancer during the interview			1
his remarks were quickly questioned by dr @entity35 , medical director of sexual health charity @entity36 , who said while oral sex could have contributed to the cancer , it was very difficult to pinpoint a single cause			1
dr @entity35 pointed out that mr @entity1 had been a smoker and a drinker - two factors that he said are the most common causes of oral cancer			1
dr @entity35 said : ' there are often a number of factors , genetic , environmental , viral , that could be playing a role			0
' the star , who fought a six - month battle with the disease from august 2010 until january 2011 , had initially believed that it was his years of smoking and drinking that had lead to the illness			1
however , in a new interview the 68 - year - old said that the particular strain he had suffered with was caused by human papilloma virus ( @entity10 ) , the most common sexually transmitted disease in the @entity63			1
@entity1 made the frank admission about how he developed the illness during an interview with @entity28 newspaper when he was asked if he had regretted smoking and drinking in the past			1
@entity1 candidly replied : ' no. because without wanting to get too specific , this particular cancer is caused by @entity10 , which actually comes about from cunnilingus			1
' @entity1 , who is married to @entity73 actress @entity72 , was diagnosed with cancer in august 2010 after a walnut - sized tumour was found on his tongue			1
@entity35 said there are hundreds of different types of hpv virus and that in most cases it does not cause damage			2
the risk is so low , he said , that he does not believe people should worry or change their sexual practices			0
fighting back : @entity1 in november 2010 , when he was battling cancer his health troubles started just a few months after his eldest son @entity88 - from his first marriage to @entity90 - was jailed for drug possession and dealing			1
the actor admitted he initially believed his disease had been triggered by the stress over his son 's legal troubles			2
he explained : ' i did worry if the stress caused by my son 's incarceration did n't help trigger it			0
' but yeah , it 's a sexually transmitted disease that causes cancer			2
and if you have it , cunnilingus is also the best cure for it			0
' @entity1 was diagnosed with stage four of the disease and underwent an intense course of chemotherapy and radiation			2
eventually , he was given the all - clear , although he still has to undergo check - ups with doctors every six months			0
however , the actor is optimistic he has conquered the disease once and for all			2
' with this kind of cancer , 95 per cent of the time it does n't come back , ' he said			0
family man : @entity1 with his wife @entity72 and their two children @entity125 and @entity128 more than 20 years ago , @entity1 was hospitalised for an addiction , which many reports at the time claimed was to sex			1
however , he has since denied that he was a sex addict , insisting that he was being treated for alcohol abuse			0
last year @entity134 said that the rising rates of @entity10 - positive cases of oral cancer could be linked to oral sex			1
@entity140 figures have also linked @entity10 to more than 5 per cent of cancers worldwide			0
@entity10 can be passed between men and women by genital contact , most often during vaginal and anal sex			0
it may also be passed on during oral sex and genital - to - genital contact			1
it can be passed on between straight and same - sex partners - even when the infected person shows no symptoms			0
last year , professor @entity151 of @entity152 said boys must be given the vaccine for hpv as well as girls			0
the jab has routinely been given to 12 and 13 - year - old girls since 2008 and protects against the virus			0
she said that to not protect them against a host of cancers , including tumours of the tongue , tonsils , head and neck , would be unethical , unfair and socially irresponsible			0
professor @entity168 explained : ' obviously cervical cancer is the big one but in @entity171 and the @entity63 and @entity172 , places that have got cervical cancer screening programmes , cervical cancer is very well controlled			0
' but the other cancers - cancers of the anus and increasingly the tonsil and tongue - there is no screening for them and no way of detecting them until they are proper cancers and they are more common in men than in women			0
' the professor said that boys , like girls , should be vaccinated at the age of 12 or 13 , before they are sexually active			0
human papilloma virus ( @entity10 ) is spread through sexual contact and is more usually associated with cervical cancer in women			1
it is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the @entity63 @entity10 can be passed between men and women by genital contact , most often during vaginal and anal sex			2
it may also be passed on during oral sex and genital - to - genital contact			1
it can be passed on between straight and same - sex partners — even when the infected person has no signs or symptoms			0
the cervical cancer jab given to 12 and 13 - year - old schoolgirls aims to cut their odds of the cancer by protecting them against the virus			2
although most mouth and throat cancers are normally blamed on drinking and smoking an increasing number of cases that occur around the tonsils and back of the tongue are due to @entity10			2
although the cancer is not contagious , the virus is			2
in the @entity63 , @entity10 is blamed for up to 80 per cent of these tumours of the tonsils and the back of the tongue , which experts say could be due to increasing popularity of oral sex			1
the typical patient is described as an otherwise healthy man in his late 40s or early 50s who has never smoked or smoked very little			0
in @entity232 , the number of mouth and throat cancers have increased by 40 per cent in just a decade , to 6,200 cases a year			2
@entity134 says the hpv virus may be key to the ‘ rapid rise ’			0
symptoms include persistent mouth ulcers , pain , discoloured patches and difficulty chewing and swallowing			0
men are advised to check their neck for lumps when shaving and both sexes to look at the back of their throat while brushing their teeth			0
treatments such as chemotherapy , radiotherapy and surgery are often more successful in mouth and throat cancers caused by the virus than those caused by tobacco and alcohol			2
although mouth cancer can be caused by @entity10 passed on by oral sex , doctors say @entity1 ’s claim that oral sex is also a cure does n’t make any medical sense .			1

actor believed it was years of smoking and drinking that caused disease
then said he discovered his cancer *stemmed* from human papilloma virus which is commonly spread via oral sex
@entity232 doctor says *impossible* to pinpoint cause to one factor
now mr @entity1 has retracted his claim oral sex was to blame
