by @entity1 reporter published : 19:51 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 19:51 est , 12 may 2013 innocent : @entity3 , 77 , was prevented from sending the card because @entity5 thought she was being rude when @entity3 went online to create a personalised birthday card for a 90 - year - old friend called @entity9 , it turned out his common name of yesteryear has been banned as a modern profanity			1
after typing in her message to her friend of 50 years , 77 - year - old mrs @entity3 was turned down and warned by the @entity5 website against using bad language			1
horrified , the tech - savvy grandmother closely checked the e-card for typing slip - ups , but still could not get approval for : ‘ many happy returns on your significant birthday			1
’ but after complaining to the store , she was told her card had been banned simply because her friend ’s name was @entity9 – the shortened version of @entity29			2
mrs @entity3 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , said yesterday yesterday said she was ‘ completely surprised ’ by @entity33 and @entity34 ’s ban			1
‘ when it came up with , “ your message can not contain profanity ” , i did n’t get it			0
i ’m obviously too innocent			0
i thought it must be the word “ significant ” that it thought was dodgy , but it still would not accept it			0
i tried various ways , taking out bits of text , but it still said no. ‘ after i wrote to @entity5 to ask what i had done wrong , i could not believe it when they sent me a prissy letter saying it was because my friend is called @entity9			1
‘ it is political correctness gone absolutely mad			0
’ @entity5 told her in the letter that the card had been banned ‘ to avoid the system being used to harass by containing profanity ’			1
it added : ‘ sadly the word showing as profanity in your card is @entity29 ’s name			0
’ the firm ’s only suggestion was that mrs @entity3 called her friend @entity29			2
instead , mrs @entity3 sent @entity9 - a friend of more than fifty years - a card by post			1
mrs @entity3 regularly sends e-cards because of their convenience			2
she said : ‘ i send e-cards because it is a nice and easy way of doing things			0
i usually use an @entity71 site , but none of their cards were sober enough to send to a 90 - year - old			0
they were all far too brash and lively			0
‘ i picked an innocuous card on the @entity5 website			1
it ’s the first time i have used them			0
i do n’t mind them weeding out profanities – i ’m glad for my grandsons to be shielded from the horrors of the internet – but it should not be beyond the wit of man to have a system that knows @entity9 is a name			0
’ mrs @entity3 , a former interior designer , who has been using the internet at home since 1995 , and browses using her computer , @entity93 and smartphone added : ‘ it is amazing how fast things have changed and advanced , but obviously too fast for @entity5			1
’ a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ we must ensure out system is robust to protect our content standards			2
’ rules : @entity5 also said : ' we understand that the customer did not intend to cause offence '			2

tech - savvy @entity3 , 77 , who also owns an @entity93 , often shops online
stunned to discover that @entity5 would *n't* let her *buy* birthday card
