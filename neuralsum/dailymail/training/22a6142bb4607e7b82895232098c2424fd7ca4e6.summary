but it appears that humans are not the only species with a discipline problem , as this lion cub 's insouciant reaction to his father 's bellowing shows			1
the grumpy lion gave the playful youngster the hairdryer treatment for blocking his path as they wandered a trail in @entity22			1
no respect : despite the fierce roars of this pride 's alpha male , this young cub seems to be completely unruffled the cub remained unruffled , however , giving him a look as if to say , in the words of spoof terror - teen @entity32 : ' am i bovvered ? ' the pride had been enjoying a stroll following an afternoon nap in the the @entity38 area , which straddles the border between @entity22 and @entity40			1

' it was afternoon and the pride was slowly waking up after the midday rest			2
the last member of the pride to wake was the alpha - male named @entity44 , who was sleeping apart from the rest of the pride , ' he said			1
' as soon as he woke up the pride went to the river area , for hunting			2
the zebras and impalas were occupying that area , mainly			0
we were interested and carefully started to follow them			0
' before entering the high - grass @entity44 had a little fun with two lion cubs			0
afterwards the glad cubs were running in front of @entity44 and behind the two lionesses			0
' straight before the high - grass area with narrow path , one of the cubs ran after the lionesses while another one stopped as he was waiting for his father			2
' not a morning person : following the parental castigation , the pride went on to do some hunting mr @entity71 went on : ' @entity44 did n't really appreciate that			2
he thought that the cub was blocking the way and he decided to castigate the small lion			1
' @entity44 bent closer to the cub and roared at him angrily			2
' the cub was so scared that he jumped a bit in panic and run away to the open space			1
' @entity44 grumbled a bit on the way to the rest of the pride , but calmed down quite quickly			0
later the pride continued the hunting			0
' the two lionesses did n't react at all			0
i think they preferred not to interfere in the educational process			0
