@entity0 agreed to plead guilty to smuggling £ 1.5m of cocaine in the hope their term would be reduced to six years and eight months the two @entity8 drug mules held in @entity2 face being handed 15 - year sentences this week as their hopes of a more lenient jail term crumble			1
@entity0 and @entity1 , both 20 , agreed to plead guilty to smuggling £ 1.5million ’s worth of cocaine in the hope their term would be reduced to six years and eight months			1
but with sentencing due to take place in a closed court in @entity21 on tuesday , the girls ’ lawyers have so far been unable to agree a plea bargain with prosecutors			1
@entity0 revealed her despair in a prison diary			1
she wrote : ‘ i have prepared myself for the worst			0
i think of how i will be in 15 years			0
and yes it does still scare me			0
‘ i would really like to have this over with by @entity28 because the fear of the unknown makes me more anxious			0
i ’ve been waiting four months already and the delays and changes are annoying			0
’ the diary displays @entity0 ’s fears about being transferred after sentencing to the prison @entity36			1
it is miles from @entity21 , making it much harder for her family to see her			2
she is also terrified that she will be separated from @entity1 , with whom she has shared a cell since their arrest			2
she added : ‘ i am consistently aware of my immediate transfer to @entity36 after my sentence and would much rather stay in [ @entity46 for the @entity28 period because of the fear of the unknown in @entity49			0
‘ [ it is ] really far from @entity21 making visiting much more difficult for my family when they come and it ’s over populated so i could possibly be separated from @entity1			1
( that ’s something i have not prepared myself for )			0
’ @entity0 revealed her despair in a prison diary			1
she wrote : ' i have prepared myself for the worst ... i think of how i will be in 15 years ... and yes it does still scare me ' last night @entity0 ’s distraught family were praying for their daughter to receive the minimum sentence			1
@entity0 ’s father @entity63 said : ‘ this is a really tense time for us – we ’ve been told sentencing is going ahead on tuesday			1
@entity0 has done everything she can , we just have to hope and pray for the best now			2
’ writing from her cell , @entity0 , from @entity70 , near @entity71 , also described her devastation at being told that under current @entity2 law she does not qualify for the benefits that allow some prisoners to get out after serving only a third of their sentence			1
the girls had hoped that by working or studying they could use the privilege to cut a six - year jail term to just over two years			1
she wrote : ‘ all this time the idea was i would be sentenced to six years eight months but then serve a third of that if i worked or studied [ in prison ] – so roughly two years three months – but now i will have to serve the full sentence			2
‘ i have never been someone to 100 per cent believe something someone tells me without evidence but of course being told i would be doing two years three months gave me somewhat of a rough guide when realistically it ’s actually miles off what i will be doing			2
’ she added : ‘ apparently things regarding the law in @entity2 change so much that anything could happen			0
who knows , the president might give a pardon and want all of the @entity101 chucked out of @entity2			0
’ the @entity102 on holiday several years ago			2
@entity0 is second right beside her mother the pair have served more than four months in the squalid @entity107 prison since being arrested in august trying to carry 24lb of cocaine on to a flight to @entity110 from @entity21 ’s international airport			1
the girls initially claimed they were kidnapped on the party island of @entity115 during a summer of partying and forced at gunpoint to traffic the drugs			0
although they subsequently declared their willingness to plead guilty , the @entity2 authorities have yet to officially accept the pleas , which means they could still be given the maximum of 15 years			1
sentencing has already been delayed twice as @entity2 judges strike for higher pay			0
although it has been set for tuesday , a last - minute delay is still possible			2
if the girls are given seven years or less they are eligible to apply for transfer to the @entity8 , though this must be agreed by both governments			1
the girls will also be required to pay a civil fine before release , likely to be several thousand pounds each			0
on tuesday , a day @entity0 described as ‘ one of the worst yet ’ , the women were driven to a court for sentencing – even though their lawyers had already told them that it would be postponed			1
she wrote : ‘ i was marched to court for nothing			0
i was transported all day from @entity143 to @entity144 [ prison ] then to other places			0
i kept wondering what was taking so long but i guess i will never know			0
finally i was brought back to @entity143			0
