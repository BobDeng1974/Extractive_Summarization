two million years ago , a massive eruption in the @entity1 caused gases to bubble out into the universe at two million miles per hour ( 3.2km/h )			1
now , astronomers are beginning to see the aftermath of the explosion : billowing clouds of gas towering 30,000 light - years above and below the plane of our galaxy			1
dubbed ' @entity14 ' , these mysterious structures should n't exist according to current astronomical theory – and scientists are still unable what caused their outburst			2
@entity19 probed the light from a distant quasar to study the so - called @entity14 , the quasar 's light passed through one of the bubbles			1
imprinted on that light was information about the bubble 's speed , composition , and mass. the outflow was produced by a violent event that happened 2 million years ago in our galaxy 's core the enormous structure was discovered five years ago as a gamma - ray glow on the sky in the direction of the galactic centre			1
using the @entity19 telescope , @entity41 is attempting to find the mass of the material being blown out of our galaxy , which could help determine the cause of the outburst			0
' the outflowing clouds we 're seeing are only 25,000 light - years away in our galaxy			1
we have a front - row seat , ' said @entity52 of the @entity53 in @entity54			0
the giant lobes of @entity14 glow in nearly uniform gamma rays and appear like two 30,000 - light - year - tall incandescent bulbs screwed into the centre of the galaxy ' we can study the details of these structures			1
we can look at how big the bubbles are and can measure how much of the sky they are covering			0
' there are a number of theories attempting to explain why the @entity1 is blowing these enormous bubbles			0
some scientists believe they could have been created by huge jets of accelerated matter blasting out from the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy			1
or they could have been formed by a population of giant stars , born from the plentiful gas surrounding the black hole , all exploding as supernovae at roughly the same time			1
another theory is that they are the result of collisions between dark matter particles that result in their annihilation , emitting charged particles in the process			0
' there are several models that explain them , but none of the models is perfect , ' said @entity97 , a postdoctoral researcher at the @entity98			0
the giant lobes of @entity14 glow in nearly uniform gamma rays and appear like two 30,000 - light - year - tall incandescent bulbs screwed into the centre of the galaxy			1
the detection of their high - energy gamma rays suggested that a violent event in the galaxy 's core violently launched energised gas into space			2
to provide more information about the outflows , professor @entity52 looked at the ultraviolet light from a distant quasar - a galaxy with a bright active nucleus - that lies behind the northern bubble			2
imprinted on that light as it travels through the lobe is unique information about the velocity , composition , and temperature of the expanding gas inside the bubble			0
the study found silicon , carbon , and aluminium , indicating that the gas is enriched in the heavy elements produced inside stars and represents the ancient remnants of star formation			1
it measured the temperature of the gas at approximately @entity139 ( 17,500 ° c ) , which is much cooler than expected			0
' we are seeing cooler gas , perhaps interstellar gas in our galaxy 's disk , being swept up into that hot outflow , ' professor @entity52 explained			2
a giant gamma - ray structure was discovered by processing @entity14 all - sky data at energies from 1 to 10 billion electron volts , shown here			2
the dumbbell - shaped feature ( centre ) emerges from the galactic core and extends 50 degrees north and south from the plane of the @entity1 , in the sky from the constellation @entity157 there are a number of theories attempting to explain why the @entity1 is blowing these enormous bubbles			0
some scientists believe they could have been created by huge jets of accelerated matter blasting out from the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy			1
or they could have been formed by a population of giant stars , born from the plentiful gas surrounding the black hole , all exploding as supernovae at roughly the same time			1
another theory is that they are the result of collisions between dark matter particles that result in their annihilation , emitting charged particles in the process			0
because the bubbles are young compared to the age of the galaxy , and believed to be a short - lived phenomenon , they may be evidence for a repeating event in the @entity1 's history			2
whatever the trigger is , it likely occurs episodically , perhaps only when the black hole gobbles up a concentration of material			0
' it looks like the outflows are a hiccup , ' professor @entity52 said			0
' there may have been repeated ejections of material that have blown up , and we 're catching the latest one			0
' the bubbles extend 30,000 light - years across			1
hints of the bubbles ' edges were first seen in x-rays ( blue )			0
the gamma rays mapped by @entity14 ( shown in magenta ) extend much farther from the galaxy 's plane			2

the ' @entity14 ' look like 30,000 - light - year - tall incandescent bulbs
they were created during a massive explosion two million years ago
scientists have been trying to find out how these mysterious bubbles formed by studying the uv light from a quasar close to the structure
the study found silicon , carbon , and aluminium in the bubbles
this suggests they may have formed by a population of giant stars
another theory suggests they could have been created by huge jets of accelerated matter blasting out from galaxy 's supermassive black hole
