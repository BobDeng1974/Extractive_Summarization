by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 23 march 2012 updated : 10:26 est , 23 march 2012 @entity1 has unveiled a new tool which lets you demote ' friends ' to just being ' acquaintances '			1
the tool actually suggests friends who might be ripe for the chop - based on people who you have n't messaged or interacted with for a while			1
once a friend has been ' demoted ' , you see fewer of their posts in your news feed - but they 'll never know of their new , lower status			2
the ' acquaintances ' list has been around since last year - but the new tool makes it easier to demote friends , by suggesting ' victims ' from your friends list ' last autumn , we introduced the @entity25 and @entity26 lists to help you see more posts in news feed from your close friends , and fewer from acquaintances you do n’t know as well , ' says @entity1 engineer @entity33			1
' today we ’re announcing a tool to make it easier to add friends to your acquaintances list			2
' the tool works like a negative version of the ' suggested friends ' the site occasionally offers			0
when you visit your @entity26 list ( next to your friends list ) a new option pops up - ' see all suggestions '			0
the friends on the list are people who @entity1 suggests might belong among your acquaintances instead			1
@entity33 is keen to emphasise that the victims will never know what 's happened			0
' when you add friends to your @entity26 list they wo n’t be unfriended or notified			0
you ’ll just see fewer of their posts in news feed .			0

site now suggests friends to ' demote '
users see fewer posts from ' acquaintances '
victims will never know their new status , says @entity1
