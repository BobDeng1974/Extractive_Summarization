' but @entity9 @entity8 , 20 , from @entity10 added : ' everyone tells me i 'm a very lucky man to have survived			1
' still in intensive care at @entity13 , mr @entity8 has had operations for broken bones and internal injuries - but he has astonished medical experts with his amazing survival			1
survivor : @entity8 survived a fall from the 15th floor of an apartment block in @entity4 high rise : mr @entity8 is lucky to be alive after falling from the 15th floor of the volt building in @entity13 , @entity4 doctors say that if he had not landed on the roof of an adjacent building - which prevented him falling a further two storeys - they have no doubt he would have been killed			1
mr @entity8 , who is on a working holiday in @entity4 , fell from a neighbour 's 15th storey balcony in an impossible attempt to lower himself to the balcony of his own apartment on the 14th floor			1
he had found he was locked out of his high rise apartment and decided to ask his upstairs neighbour if he could go onto her balcony and drop down to his own			1
the neighbour , @entity41 , 28 , said mr @entity8 , who was ' a little bit tipsy ' , woke her up at two o'clock in the morning			1
' i was n't scared of him , ' she told the @entity43			2
' he just requested " can you please let me jump off from the balcony			2
i will not bother you , just let me use your balcony			2
" ' i never thought he would really do that			2
in my mind i thought " ok , i 'll just let you see that it 's really impossible			2
" i did n't think he 'd jump because it 's really scary			2
' lucky : @entity8 , pictured on holiday , was saved by landing on the roof of an adjacent building facebook of @entity8 posing for the camera while on a night out but mr @entity8 was determined to jump - as she soon found out			1
he walked through miss @entity41 's flat and out onto her balcony , which is about 3ft wide and before she could react he had one leg over the railing			2
' i asked him " are you all right ? it 's unsafe to jump over the rail			0
he never said anything â€¦ i grabbed his hand and then at that time he fell down			1
' i thought i was dreaming			0
it happened so fast ; it happened in seconds			0
i could n't even scream for help			0
he was like a paper falling from here			0
' ' he ca n't remember anything about the fall , ' said mr @entity77 , who spoke to his friend briefly yesterday			0
' he 's a very lucky man			0
' mr @entity77 said the two of them had been on a night out with fellow travellers when mr @entity8 became separated from them and went home alone			1
' he 'd had a fair bit to drink , ' said mr @entity77 , ' but i was only 10 to 15 minutes behind him when i headed home			0
' he recalled that when he and a third flatmate reached the front door of their apartment block they were met by police searching for identification for the seriously injured man			1
' this is n't typical behaviour of him , ' said mr @entity77			0
' he 's normally the sensible one out of all of us			0
' medical experts are astonished at mr @entity8 's survival			1
@entity100 medical director dr @entity99 said survival from such a great height was ' extraordinary '			0
party game : @entity8 , pictured right with a friend on a night out , suffered a broken neck , back and wrist ' we 've seen patients in @entity13 who have had their falls broken by awnings over windows , umbrellas , those sorts of things , ' he said			1
' but the roof this young man fell on to would not have prevented serious injury			2
from that sort of height you can have injuries to everything and anything			0
survival from falls of that height are extraordinarily unusual			0
' being under the influence of alcohol would not have relaxed the body to the point that serious injury would not occur , said dr @entity99			0
' it 's like being in a car crash			0
if you 're going to hit something at speed , relaxed or not is not going to make much difference			0
' mr @entity8 's friends said they have been told by doctors that if he continues to make progress he might be able to leave hospital in about a week to 10 days			1
bed rest : @entity8 , pictured right with some friends , will have to remain in hospital for another week while doctors monitor his progress			1
