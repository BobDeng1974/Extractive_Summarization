there was a time when @entity2 was a peripheral figure with @entity4 , seemingly destined to be a nearly man not quite good enough at the highest level with either ball or bat			1
now @entity2 , after taking his chance in @entity11 and in the first match of the tri-series against @entity14 in @entity15 on friday , has become the most important bowling name on @entity4 ’s @entity18 team - sheet			1
that is some achievement when you consider that @entity4 have @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and , as long as he can regain fitness , @entity25 at their disposal for a one - day tour that began with defeat at the @entity29			1
@entity2 poses for a portrait after a press conference in @entity32 on saturday @entity33 has emerged as a key @entity4 bowler ahead of the @entity18 next month matches : 25 wickets : 34 best figures : 6 - 45 average : 30.18 economy : 5.84 strike rate : 31.0 @entity4 showed how valuable @entity33 has become in 50 - over cricket when he took the new ball ahead of @entity21 in @entity15 , returned at the death and responded by being the most successful and quickest bowler on show			1
it was not enough to enable @entity4 to defend the meagre 234 all out that saw the wounds of the traumatic @entity50 tour re-opened by @entity14 but it was a promising sign of what @entity33 can deliver in the @entity18 challenges to come			1
‘ yes i hope so , ’ said @entity2 yesterday when asked if he finally felt established , at 25 , with @entity4			1
‘ @entity11 was good for me and , with @entity25 and @entity54 not being around , it gave guys who have not played as much an opportunity to stake a claim			2
‘ i felt like i did that there and i ’m trying to continue it here			2
it is nice to know that i ’ve performed well at international level now			2
i ’ve been in and out and have n’t known if i was going to play or not			2
it does help if you know you ’ve got a good chance of playing			2
it ’s a confidence booster			0
’ @entity33 celebrates as he takes the wicket of @entity67 during the tri-series defeat by @entity14 on friday the @entity71 all - rounder is congratulated after dismissing @entity72 during friday 's defeat @entity4 travelled to @entity32 on friday to face that other one - day powerhouse in @entity75 on tuesday and it was at the @entity76 four years ago that @entity33 announced himself with a six - wicket haul against @entity14			1
it has taken since then for him to fulfil his obvious potential and it was another six - wicket return against @entity11 in @entity82 before @entity83 – which made @entity2 the first @entity4 bowler to take two six - wicket one - day hauls – that convinced @entity4 he is now the real deal			1
in @entity15 he added another four wickets in the key scalps of @entity89 , @entity72 , @entity90 and @entity67 but , sadly , not before @entity89 had hit the century that confirmed @entity14 as the team to beat in the @entity18			1
‘ i thought we bowled reasonably okay and it would have been nice to have a bigger total to defend but unfortunately it was n’t to be , ’ said @entity2			2
@entity2 took four wickets in the opening match of the tri-series , but it was n't enough as @entity4 lost the 25 - year - old shares a high - five with wicket keeper @entity101 after taking the wicket of @entity89 ‘ they were trying to finish the game in a hurry which gave opportunities and to pick up wickets was brilliant			1
i felt i bowled well with the new ball and got my rewards later on			0
’ clearly , the ‘ yard ’ of pace that the @entity71 all - rounder has added to his bowling , as well as the variety that saw him successfully mix it up at the death in @entity15 , has been the key to his new - found senior status			1
‘ looking at the big screen , i saw i was bowling at around 140 kph ( 87 miles per hour ) , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ probably 18 months ago i was only bowling at 130 , 132 , 134 max. i definitely feel i ’ve put on a yard			0
maybe a bit more than 140 occasionally			0
it ’s good for me to see			0
‘ it has been a gradual process			0
i ’ve been working on it for a couple of years now , starting with @entity125 at @entity71 and @entity126 at @entity127 during my @entity129 period			0
there were a few technical issues to sort out and i also feel now i ’m more energetic in my run up			0
so there has been hard work and it has n’t just happened overnight			0
it ’s good to see the rewards			0
’ @entity33 has his eyes on the ball as he prepares to take a catch to dismiss @entity140 @entity2 , who admits he now feels established with @entity4 , safely holds on to the ball @entity33 is very much a three - dimensional cricketer too			1
he is a dangerous lower middle order hitter and an athletic fielder , even if he did nearly make a hash of a straightforward chance that came his way during @entity4 ’ s tour match win against a @entity149 in @entity150			1
@entity2 juggled the catch on the boundary , went to ground and kicked it up , football style , before pouching it , to his immense relief			2
‘ you ’re not going to believe me but i reckon i meant to do it , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ i misjudged the catch to begin with , so i made a meal of it , then as soon as it was rolling down my leg , i tried to kick the ball to get it up			0
fortunately it came back to me and stuck			0
‘ i thought it was my right foot but everybody says it was my left			0
it definitely hit my boot			0
i ’m a @entity171 fan			0
perhaps they could do with me at the moment			0
’ the emergence of @entity2 , who also played in the last three tests of last summer against @entity75 , has been important for @entity4			1
@entity25 needs to play on tuesday to ease concerns that he is struggling to regain full fitness after missing the @entity11 tour to rest his troublesome knee			0
@entity33 juggles the ball off his feet before taking a catch during the tour match win against prime minister 's @entity149 @entity33 has been working hard on his bowling action over the last two years to increase his pace meanwhile , @entity21 is still easing his way back to full fitness after knee surgery of his own , @entity23 can be erratic and @entity22 sadly still looks a shadow of the bowler who was among the best in the world in one - day cricket barely two years ago			1
he is getting better but , as his clattering into the stumps on friday showed , @entity22 is far from over the problems that forced him to be sent home from @entity32 this time last year			0
add the fact that @entity198 seems to have reservations about the effectiveness of @entity201 , hence his decision to leave him out on a dry , worn @entity29 pitch on friday , and it is clear to see that @entity4 ’s one - dimensional bowling is a bigger worry than the batting which failed them on friday			1
the need for @entity33 to carry on emerging as the unlikely leader of the one - day attack , then , is vitally important here for @entity4 .			1

@entity2 has been a peripheral figure with @entity4 in the past
@entity33 has now emerged as @entity4 's most valuable one - day bowler
the all - rounder , at 25 , now feels established in the @entity4 set - up
@entity2 took four wickets in the first tri-series match against @entity14
