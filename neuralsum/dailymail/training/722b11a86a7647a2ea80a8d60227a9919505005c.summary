' @entity7 added : ' as this chapter ends for us a new one begins			2
i love and cherish her and her boys and we will be close forever			2

' @entity120 reported : ' @entity7 wanted out , and in the fragile state that @entity3 is in , it ’s not like he could have a rational conversation with her about it , so it was really between him and @entity114			1
they decided how the relationship needed to end and how to go about the technicalities , such as removing @entity7 from the conservatorship , when he would move out and how to announce the split			2
@entity3 was left out of everything and really did n’t even know what was going on			2
' @entity7 and @entity114 wanted to make sure that @entity3 did n’t lose it , so they had to water things down for her a bit			1
' keeping close : @entity3 assures fans that she and @entity7 will ' remain great friends ' and added that she will ' always adore him ' rare solo outing : coffee - toting @entity3 and her sons go shopping for pet supplies in @entity142 , @entity55 , in november on her own : @entity3 goes grocery shopping , in a rare pictures taken without @entity7 by her side , in october @entity3 had raked in $ 15 million for her judging role on the @entity6			1

' the former mouseketeer is likely being wooed to star in her own long - running show at the @entity181 at @entity182 since that is where @entity184 and @entity185 also held residencies			0

' we are talking about someone who has documented mental issues , someone who has made headlines for just the number of breaks she needed during tje the x-factor auditions			0
we are talking about someone who lip - sang all through her last world tour despite many of her fans ' outrage			0
' a @entity5 residency must be a huge challenge for any performer and the pressure surely must be enough to break even the strongest of characters			0
' how will a person as mentally vulnerable as @entity3 is said to be , manage demanding shows several nights a week , week after week , month after month , for one , or two or three years in a row ? i am afraid her paying fans shall have to brace themeselves for a huge and disappointment if such a deal is closed , her critics will have a field day and @entity3 herself may be pushed over the edge and onto another mental breakdown as a result			2
' however , a close friend of @entity3 told @entity19 today : ' she is well and has amazing family and friends who love her			1
she is dancing five days a week and is in the studio working on her 8th album			1
