by @entity0 it 's the ideal solution for commuters - a full size bicycle which fits into a bag and is assembled in less than ten minutes			1
commuters struggling to fit their fold - up bikes on trains will instead be able to carry a normal - sized bike to work with them in a small backpack the size of a tyre			2
on arrival , all they need to do is attach the various aluminium hollow tubes together from simple twist joints - including the wheels			1
commuter 's dream : this full - size prototype bicycle fits into a bag and is assembled in under ten minutes and the chain is different to most bikes in that it uses a rubber belt drive system reinforced with carbon , while to brake you simply stop pedalling			1
@entity28 , a creative director at @entity30 creative agency @entity29 , helped come up with the design because he wanted to make a full - size but compact carrying bike			1
the result is the @entity35 - designed to take out the awkward nature of fold - up bikes			2
mr @entity28 , 35 , said : ' conventional bikes are awkward in every way except when you ride them			0

the prototype kit bike is put together by attaching the various aluminium hollow tubes using simple twist joints ( right ) storage : each wheel is stored in a separate section of the bag , separate from the remaining 19 parts a rival design to the @entity35 is the origami bike that can fold into a package the size as an umbrella			1
an @entity66 designed has revealed the bike , which even has folding wheels , and a hub instead of a chain			0
however , despite its tiny size when folded , it still boast full size 26inch wheels and can even be folded in a single move			0
inventor @entity75 says he first came up with the idea after being disappointed with current folding bike designs			0
' the idea of a folding bike has undertaken numerous studies that focus on reducing the weight and dimensions which have led , to too small sized bicycles , ' he said			0
after dozens of prototypes , he developed the current bike , which includes wheels with no spokes , and a design small enough to be used as a backpack			0
' the project may pave the way for a new system of mobility outside the classical schemes , widely accessible and easily transportable , ' he explains			0
' we thought what if there was a bike that was so small , it fit into a bag you could carry as a backpack ? ' what if when you assembled the bike , you got a full - size bike that was comfortable to ride ? ' we felt we could make one simple , minimal and cool - unlike folding bikes that tend to be complex in their engineering and construction			2
' @entity111 was designed to do all these things and make problems of shipping and travelling with a bike a thing of the past			0
' the @entity35 consists of simple twist joints that lock with aluminium hollow tubes using a specially designed key			1
the entire bike can be assembled from the leather bag or dismantled from one side making the process extremely simple and quick			1
each wheel is stored in a separate section of the bag , while the remaining 19 parts caters for the hollow tubing , seat , handlebars and chain			0
mr @entity28 , from @entity133 , @entity30 , said : ' @entity134 and disassembly would take 10 minutes or less			2
' at the moment it 's still a prototype so we are not sure how much it will be to buy but it should weight similar to most aluminium bikes			0
' pedal power : the chain uses a rubber belt drive system made of carbon , while to brake you stop pedalling early stage : designer mr @entity28 , from @entity133 , said : ' at the moment it 's still a prototype so we are not sure how much it will be to buy but it should weight similar to most aluminium bikes ' final design : @entity28 , a creative director at @entity30 creative agency @entity29 , helped come up with the design because he wanted to make a full - size but compact carrying bike			1

the @entity35 was created by @entity133 - based designer @entity28
it is put together by attaching aluminium hollow tubes using twist joints
when dismantled , the entire bike fits into a leather bag the size of a tyre
design is currently a prototype and there are currently no plans to sell it
