to understand why @entity1 is doomed , you only have to stand on a nearby hillside and watch as the @entity4 maniacs tighten their grip			1
a few hundred yards away , the besieged town was in flames again yesterday as the jihadis fired mortar bombs into densely - packed neighbourhoods			0
every explosive thud and pillar of smoke signifies yet more deaths , as the men , women and children of the stricken @entity19 frontier town desperately fight to the last			1
it is a deeply uneasy feeling to witness this life - and - death struggle against a terrorist state while standing in @entity24 , a country that regards itself as @entity25			1
their menacing black flag has fluttered from at least two roof - tops for several days			0
nato ground forces are but half a mile away			0
@entity59 on the hills overlooking @entity1 are rows of @entity24 army tanks bristling with fire - power			1
at first glance , it looks as if this means the cavalry has arrived , ready to sweep into @entity1 and offer protection at last to the wretched townsfolk			1
surely , you think , it is possible for them to drive just a few hundred yards further , into @entity19 , and start to disperse the @entity4 fanatics into retreat ? but the facts are very different			1
although @entity24 , with the second largest army in @entity77 and keen to join the @entity78 , has pledged ‘ to do everything ’ it can to prevent a massacre unfolding on @entity25 ’s doorstep , in truth , it seems to suit the country ’s rulers not to send in their tanks			1
for , unlike every other @entity87 government , @entity24 - with its historic problems with the @entity29 minority - perversely considers @entity4 to be ‘ an opportunity not a threat ’			1
despite there being more than 30 airstrikes on @entity1 ( pictured ) since monday , @entity29 civilians remained trapped inside the city at the border itself , rather than helping the @entity99 in @entity1 , the @entity24 military is effectively contributing to the stranglehold by blocking reinforcements that the town so urgently needs			1
meanwhile , thousands of @entity99 from across @entity24 have descended on the border region in the past fortnight to support their @entity19 kin			1
they want to go across and fight , and their sense of betrayal is palpable as the tragedy of @entity1 unfolds before their eyes on the other side of a wire fence			1
around mid-morning yesterday , a @entity24 armoured vehicle zoomed across the desert , spreading clouds of dust			2
a gunner sitting on top started shouting at the @entity99 , ordering them to retreat because @entity4 militants were shelling the nearby border crossing			1
one man refused to leave , coughing on the dust and yelling back : ‘ we will stay here			0
our friends and cousins and children are there			0
we do n’t believe you			0
we want to fight @entity130 , even if it is just with stones			0
’ crowds of @entity29 refugees and @entity24 residents flocked to the border with @entity19 today to watch the battle unfold in the distance pictured left , smoke from a @entity31 airstrike billows into the air , and right groups of refugees watch the bombing the aerial bombardment on @entity1 continued throughout the day while @entity99 on the @entity24 side of the border could only watch on as they kin were killed in the clashes with @entity149 militants witnesses watched on as the jihadists released mortars into civilian areas of the city during breaks between @entity31 bombings ( pictured ) @entity157 , 42 , a telecoms worker from @entity158 explained the impasse			1
‘ those tanks are not here to help us			0
they will wait and watch , until all the @entity99 have been killed by @entity149			1
’ his view was echoed by @entity164 , 40 , who said : ‘ we are so angry with the @entity24 government because they are helping @entity149 with money and weapons			1
those tanks could help us , but they do n’t			0
’ others , though , are just glad to be out of the battle - zone			0
@entity171 , 35 , a labourer who fled @entity1 to @entity24 five days ago with his family , is devastated as he stands beneath an olive tree and watches plumes of black smoke rise over his home town			1
his four children – twins aged three , a four - year - old girl and a five - year - old boy – cling to his leg			0
they are silent and just stare			0
the black flag of @entity149 is raised on a building situated at the top of the town he says they just ‘ ran for our lives ’ , leaving behind his uncle who was beheaded			2
he says his children are terrified and did not sleep for days			0
‘ i built our house , but @entity149 have destroyed it			2
we are lucky to be alive			0
’ inside @entity1 , under siege for nearly a month , the hideous struggle goes on to prevent it from becoming another @entity149 stronghold			1
men , women and children as young as ten bearing ak - 47s are all that stand in the way of the butchering jihadis			0
images of gun - toting grandmothers , teenage girls in jeans and primary school - age boys , all vowing to fight to the last , have been tweeted around the world			0
some elderly people have refused to leave their homes , preferring to die there rather than be refugees in a foreign land			0
one desperate woman , @entity214 , even turned herself into a suicide bomber to kill a group of @entity149 fighters			2
it must be said that five days of @entity31 - led bombing raids have had some successes , pushing the extremists back to the edges of the town , which was about to fall a week ago			0
the low whirr of tornado fighter aircraft can also be heard in the skies before they drop their bombs			0
we saw two bombs land yesterday , appearing to strike a hospital used by @entity149 as a base in the east of the town , in which they already have a foothold			2
but almost simultaneously , word spread that @entity149 had captured the town ’s prison , enabling them to release inmates to help join their cause			2
@entity149 has been able to use high - grade military kit that once belonged to the @entity31 and were looted from the @entity244 army			1
they include night - vision googles , meaning they can ambush the unsuspecting civilians of @entity1 in the dead of night			1
already at least seven people have been beheaded , with subsequent gruesome displays made of their heads			0
those who escaped watch helplessly from the hillside overlooking the town			0
‘ we all have family and friends in there , but no one knows if they are still alive , ’ said 38 - year - old @entity253			0
‘ we can not contact them and are very worried about whether they have access to food and water			0
’ if @entity149 succeeds in taking @entity1 , the terror group will have seized an unbroken 125 - mile stretch of border with @entity24			1
the town will be subjected to a brutal regime in which anyone disobeying rules will have their head cut off or be crucified			0
as the @entity24 army is accused of standing idly by as atrocities are committed just yards away , parallels have been drawn with the @entity276 massacre in @entity277 during the @entity278 in 1995 , when 8,000 people were massacred			2
despite the @entity31 air - strikes , the @entity99 feel very vulnerable - confronting hostility a range of enemies with different historical reasons for seeking to kill them , control them , or rejoice that somebody else – even @entity4 – might do the dirty work for them			1
@entity290 , 45 , a @entity24 kurd , said yesterday : ‘ everyone hates the @entity99			1
the @entity24 hate us and will never save us			2
meanwhile , [ @entity19 dictator ] @entity293 would be happy to see us crushed			2
and @entity4 wants to turn @entity1 into a medieval caliphate			2
we do n’t have many friends			0
’ so while @entity24 ought to be @entity77 ’s first line of defence against the fundamentalists - and it must be said that most @entity24 are appalled at the savagery of @entity149 , the terror group ’s activities may not be entirely unwelcome to the government which fears encouraging the @entity29 separatist movement inside its own borders			1
the crisis has seen explosive clashes in more than 20 cities as @entity99 protested against the government ’s aloof stance towards the stricken @entity99 in @entity1			1
more than 30 people have died including ten yesterday when gunmen opened fire on police in eastern @entity24			2
fighting in the small border city has raged for three weeks now in the face of determined jihadist advances the airstrikes in @entity1 ( pictured ) have not stopped @entity149 forces from invading the city but have helped delay their advance it 's feared there could be a massacre of civilians if @entity149 takes the city of @entity1 ( pictured ) , with thousands believed to be trapped either nearby or within the town six provinces in south - east @entity24 have been placed under night - time curfew			1
police have been meet the protesters with tear gas , sticks and water cannon , while angry @entity99 have hurled stones and @entity337 cocktails			2
for the @entity99 , the siege of @entity1 has become a rallying cause likened to the infamous atrocity in @entity244 in 1998 when the then @entity244 dictator @entity341 poisoned 5,000 @entity99 at @entity342			1
diplomats believe @entity344 is cynically exploiting the is threat to extract concessions from both the @entity31 and the @entity99			2
he is demanding a buffer zone inside @entity19 , policed by @entity24 , and a commitment by @entity349 to overthrow @entity293			1
writing in @entity353 journal @entity351 , author @entity350 claimed this week : ‘ @entity344 and his disciples view @entity1 as an opportunity rather than a threat			0
’ whatever the outcome of these international power games , time is running out for the benighted people of @entity1			0
caught in crossfire - both diplomatic and deadly real - all they can do is fight , pray and hope .			0
