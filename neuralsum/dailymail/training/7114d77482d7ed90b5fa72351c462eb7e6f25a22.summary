by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 11:36 est , 26 july 2013 out after scandal : @entity2 was seen going to work meetings the day after she made a joint press conference with her husband @entity5 @entity2 has sparked further controversy with the revelation that she was employed by private companies at the same time as working for the @entity9			1
for the first time this week @entity2 is being questioned over something unrelated to her decision to stand by her husband @entity5 during his latest sexting scandal			1
@entity2 has spent almost 20 years working for @entity14 , first while her husband @entity15 was president and then most recently when she was running the @entity9			0
after @entity2 gave birth to her son @entity17 , she returned to @entity19 's side in the @entity9 in june 2012 but her title changed from deputy chief of staff to ' special government employee '			2
the @entity23 reported that little changed about @entity2 's actual role in affair of state , but she also began consulting for private firms			2
her expertise came for a price , as @entity30 is reporting that @entity31 paid her $ 355,000 , which is well over double her $ 135,000 salary from the @entity9			0
she and her husband reported earning $ 496,000 that year , with @entity5 's contributions coming from the consulting business he quietly opened before making his bid for a new political life			0
now one @entity38 is calling for @entity2 to explain what inside knowledge , if any , she brought to the public sector from her dealings in the @entity9 ' i am concerned that the ' special government employee ' designation blurs the line between public and private sector employees , especially when employees receive full - time salaries for what appears to be part - time work , ' senator @entity43 of @entity44 wrote in a letter to @entity2 and sitting secretary of state @entity54			1
on the side : @entity2 reportedly made $ 355,000 from her consulting work that happened as she worked for @entity14 when the former first lady was secretary of state supportive : in 2012 , after her husband @entity5 resigned from @entity59 , @entity2 earned $ 135,000 from the @entity9 and $ 355,000 from her consulting work in response , @entity2 said that the move was approved by @entity9 lawyers			1
she wrote back to the @entity64 senator saying she ' was not asked , nor did i provide , insights about the @entity9 , my work with the secretary , or any government information to which i may have had access '			1
the discrepancy between her work for the government and the private sector first appeared in may as @entity5 began to plot his campaign to become @entity77 's next mayor			0
she did not disclose her work with @entity31 as part of her financial report , which is a standard filing for government employees in order to make known any possible conflicts of interest			0
close connections : one @entity64 senator is now calling for clarification as he fears she may have used classified information to help @entity31 financially no more : mrs @entity2 , seen here telling a coffee server to move during a conference in @entity90 , has worked for mrs @entity14 in various capacity since 1996 though officials are generally expected to report any sources of income , @entity19 's longtime spokesman @entity92 said she did not have to do so			2
her close work with mrs @entity14 has carried on past the @entity9 and @entity2 was said to have gone on a call with the former secretary an hour after she gave her joint press conference with her husband on tuesday where she said she was aware that he continued sexting women well after he resigned from @entity59 .			0

@entity5 's wife was given a special title that allowed her to work for the @entity9 while earning *hundreds* of thousands from private firms
@entity64 senator worried about a conflict of interest
comes after @entity2 *widely* *criticized* for standing by her husband during his latest sexting scandal
