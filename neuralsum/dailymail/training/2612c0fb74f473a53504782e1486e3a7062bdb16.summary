house speaker @entity2 's lawsuit against him is just a ' stunt , ' president @entity0 told @entity5 anchor @entity4 on thursday			1
@entity0 said he 'd already talked to the @entity7 legislator and that he told him , ‘ " if you ’re really concerned about me taking too many executive actions , why do n’t you try getting something done through @entity11 ? " ' ' you 're going to squawk if i try to fix some parts of it administratively that are within my authority while you 're not doing anything ? ' @entity0 said , referring to @entity17 republicans			1
" i 'm not going to apologize for trying to do something while they 're doing nothing			0
' the @entity17 has passed legislation that would curb the president 's power to take executive actions that @entity7 say fall outside his constitutional authority , but @entity41 majority leader @entity40 has declared them dead on arrival			1
on wednesday @entity2 announced he will file a lawsuit against president @entity0 for what he claimed is a series of abuses of power in the executive branch of the federal government			1
' this is not about impeachment , ' the @entity52 legislator insisted			0
' it 's about him faithfully executing the laws of this country			1
' ' what we 've seen , clearly over the last five years , is an effort to erode the power of the legislative branch , ' @entity2 said			2
' i believe the president is not faithfully executing the laws of our country			1
' better things to do : the @entity17 has said it 's not going to let @entity2 's lawsuit consume its attention unphased : @entity0 went about his business on friday , speaking on the economy in @entity73 , @entity28 , before heading back to @entity74 @entity0 's more controversial actions have included raising the minimum wage for companies undertaking new federal government contracts , ordering a long series of changes to the implementation schedule of his @entity83 law , decreeing new fuel - economy standards for trucks , and – most recently – declaring that the @entity87 will enforce a wide - ranging set of rules governing carbon emissions			1
@entity0 's @entity90 , formalized this week , is being called a ' coal - killer ' because it will dramatically increase costs associated with building and running coal - fired electric power plants			1
but most objectionable to conservatives in @entity2 's caucus , according to multiple @entity98 sources , is the president 's 2012 action that deferred deportation for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity104 as children			1
that move , @entity7 say , led directly to the current border crisis that has seen tens of thousands of unaccompanied children – including many toddlers and infants – being brought across the @entity104 - @entity112 border in the hope of an amnesty			1
@entity2 told reporters on wednesday that he has n't yet decided which of @entity0 's executive actions he will challenge in federal court			1
' when i make that decision , i 'll let you know , ' he said			0
he told a closed - door @entity123 meeting on tuesday – and followed up with a detailed memo – that he plans to move ahead with the lawsuit in the coming weeks			2
the whole @entity126 would be the plaintiff , meaning he will need the approval of @entity17 leaders			0
with the @entity7 in the majority , that is n't expected to be a problem			0
the @entity133 , an informal @entity17 leadership panel , will likely make the call			0
it includes @entity2 , newly minted majority leader @entity135 and majority whip @entity136 , minority leader @entity137 and minority whip @entity138			2
a simple majority vote , likely 3 - 2 , will determine if @entity2 can proceed			2
asked in his weekly press briefing on wednesday if he 's committed to moving forward , he replied , ' i am			0
' ' you notice that he did n't specifically say what exactly he was objecting to , ' @entity0 said when asked about the suit by @entity145			2
' right now we ’ve got a @entity7 that seems to only care about saying " no " to me			0
' unphased : @entity0 went about his business on friday , speaking on the economy in @entity73 , @entity28 , before heading back to @entity74 @entity151 host @entity150 , an unlikely ally of the @entity0 administration , bemoaned the @entity7 's latest move as partisan politics on his show wednesday afternoon			1
' where was your rage when @entity159 were going after president @entity160 on the same use of executive orders ? ' @entity150 asked @entity28 rep. @entity163			2
' i think you know in your heart of hearts this is a waste of time now			0
there are far more important things you guys have to be addressing			0
' @entity163 apparently did n't get her caucus leader 's memo that the purpose of the lawsuit was not to impeach the president			2
' what we should do right now is defund the executive branch while we have the option , ' @entity163 said			0
' what we can do further is impeach the elected official			0
' ' think about what you are saying , ' @entity150 told her during the shouting match			0
' the @entity159 would be in their right mind to laugh you out			0
' executive action : the @entity7 says @entity0 's 2012 unilateral policy change on immigration enticed tens of thousands of unaccompanied children to cross the @entity104 border , putting a strain on government resources and creating a humanitarian emergency @entity2 said he has n't yet decided exactly which of @entity0 's executive actions he will challenge in court @entity17 press secretary @entity201 accused congressional @entity7 of obstruction on wednesday , and said they had left @entity0 with little option but to make greater use of his executive authority ' the fact that they are considering a taxpayer - funded lawsuit against the @entity210 for doing his job , i think , is the kind of step that most @entity104 would n't support , ' @entity201 said			1
' this lawsuit is not going to consume the attention of the @entity17			0
' @entity2 spokesman @entity219 pushed back on the @entity0 administration on friday , telling reporters via email , ' the @entity104 people , their elected representatives , and the @entity218 have all expressed serious concerns about the president ’s failure to follow the @entity226			1
' ' dismissing them with words like , " smidgen " or " stunt ’ " only reinforces their frustration , ' he said			0
@entity0 ' has a clear record of ignoring the @entity104 people ’s elected representatives and exceeding his constitutional authority , which has dangerous implications for both our system of government and our economy , ' he told @entity241 earlier this week .			1

the president has taken at least 20 ' executive actions ' this year , including new *global* *warming* rules , a minimum wage hike and changes to the @entity83 law
conservatives in @entity11 are angry about @entity0 's 2012 change in immigration policy which they say led to a crush of unaccompanied children on @entity104 's *southern* border
