@entity4 , who later hinted at issues within the dressing room , admitted : ‘ i ’m not arrogant enough to think i am safe from anything			1
‘ any manager will tell you that you have to win games and get results , particularly after the way we have been developing as a club			2
‘ i have great communication with the owners			2
we ’ve been honest enough with each other and we have to get results			2
‘ you have to perform			2
owners and directors and chairmen have to see development on the field			0
‘ barring this period , our development has been very good and fast			0
but there 's no doubt you have to get results			2
‘ that will support the confidence to the owners , and you take it from there			0
i will only ever do my best			0
‘ the best has seen us develop well			0
now i must fight even harder			0
the full responsibility comes down to me			0
@entity64 ( left ) and @entity65 look dejected after @entity7 again blew a lead in south @entity67 @entity68 and @entity69 celebrate after @entity8 took a lead they would not relinquish the @entity73 boss hinted at issues within the dressing room after another defeat in the league ‘ now i have to fight even harder and take the responsibility			1
as manager , the responsibility comes down to me and any pressure comes on to me			0

‘ no matter the £ 120million spent on players , [ @entity113 ] @entity112 has gone - so what ? @entity112 has gone			2
they are still mentally weak , there is no leadership on the pitch			2
‘ as a @entity7 fan , which i am - i do n't care about being neutral on tv - what i 'm saying is as a fan when you 're watching your own team , the worst thing you can ever be throwing at your own team or think of them is they are being bullied or being weak and that 's what we 've seen today from @entity7 , and not for the first time			1

‘ @entity7 are n't getting beat by quality , they 're getting bullied			1
they 're getting beaten by enthusiasm from @entity8			1

we 've brought in very good players			0
