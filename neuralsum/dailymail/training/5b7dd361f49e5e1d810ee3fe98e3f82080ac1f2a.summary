the end of major roadworks is always a cause for celebration			2
residents on one street , who had suffered disruption and delays for 19 months , were so delighted that the work was finally complete they threw a party			1
they adorned @entity10 in @entity11 with bunting , blew up balloons and set up the children ’s face painting stall , while local businesses stocked up in preparation for a busy weekend			1
but the street ’s jubilant mood soon fell flat – when it turned out the roadworks were not finished after all			2
residents of the street in @entity11 were dismayed to learn the road works would be going on for another month ( file image ) the project to extend the city ’s tram network was already nearly a year behind schedule – with the road originally due to reopen shortly after christmas 2013			1
the work , which was meant to be completed in time for the party on saturday , will now not be finished until the end of november			1
