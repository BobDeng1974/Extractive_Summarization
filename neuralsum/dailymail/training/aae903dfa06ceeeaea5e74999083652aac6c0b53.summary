@entity0 have officials at every @entity0 match and the one at @entity3 ’s meeting with @entity10 at the weekend included hearing the song in their report			1
if the @entity0 reports it to the @entity3 could be fined or even have a part of the @entity6 closed			1
the steps being considered are a result of @entity19 football ’s intention of cutting out all forms of crowd trouble or incitement to crowd trouble since a @entity25 supporter was killed in a pitched battle before a match at @entity30 ’s @entity29 stadium in november			0
@entity3 fans chanted ' @entity4 is a drunk ' about @entity33 star @entity4 at the @entity6 @entity3 could now face disciplinary action from the @entity19 league			1
pictured is their star man @entity37 despite what some might term ' terrace banter ' appearing to have little to do with the organised violence that ended with a supporter being beaten to death outside a stadium last year , the football authorities have included chants and songs in their crackdown on trouble			2
