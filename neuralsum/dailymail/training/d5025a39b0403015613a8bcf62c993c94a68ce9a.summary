and @entity8 from @entity9 has certainly achieved that			1
not only is she now able to run around after @entity11 , 6 , @entity12 , 4 , and @entity13 , 1 , she 's also planning to take part in her first half marathon			1

@entity8 lost 14 stone after becoming a aunty she told the @entity23 she had always struggled with her weight and overindulged daily on crisps , chocolate and takeaways			1
she explains : ' i kept gaining weight because i could n't take control of what i was eating			1
some people may have a pair of jeans and they know they 've put on a few pounds if they become too tight so they cut back on junk foods			2
but i would just get the next size up in jeans			2
' i tried diets but i could n't get to grips with them , i did n't have the will power			0
' @entity8 said it was becoming an aunty that gave her the incentive she needed to lose weight			1
she said : ' i could barely walk and i could n't take them swimming or run after them at the playground because of my size			1
i wanted to be an active aunty so i knew i had to do something to get my life back			2
' after taking up running and ditching the junk food @entity8 now weighs 11 and a half stone and is preparing to run in the @entity56 this sunday she swapped her unhealthy diet for one rich in fruit and vegetables and cut back on carbs			1
multiple slices of toast at breakfast were swapped for muesli and she replaced the fizzy drinks she used to have regularly with water			0
she also plucked up the courage to try running			0
she said : ' running was such a big challenge for me			0
i was too embarrassed to be seen running on public roads so i went to a local reservoir and ran there instead			0
just taking those first running steps was an accomplishment , it was such an unknown feeling , like someone trying skiing for the first time			2
' at first i struggled to run a mile but i kept pushing myself			0
' before breakfast : toast lunch : sandwiches dinner : @entity86 snacks : crisps and chocolate drinks : coke and other fizzy drinks after breakfast : muesli lunch : chicken salad dinner : fish with vegetables snack : fruit and vege such as carrot sticks drinks : water @entity8 's efforts paid off , she became fitter and the weight started to come off			1
two and half years later , she 's now 11 - and - a - half - stone and a dress size 12 - 14			1
@entity8 said she has never felt more confident and now loves being active by exercising six days a week			2

as well as now being able to run long distances , she said her new body shape has made a difference to the simple things in life			0
' now i can put my socks on more easily and tie my shoes laces and i can find clothes that fit , ' she said			0
she 's now the fittest she has ever been and has progressed from completing a 5k race to a 5 miler to a 10k			0
now she 's planning to take part in the @entity128 in @entity129 on sunday to raise money for the charity scope			1
she said : ' if someone had told me three years ago that i would be running a half marathon , i would n't have believed them			2
i 'm not proud of how big i was but i am proud of what i have achieved now			0
' my parents , my sister , my brother and my amazing friends have given me the most incredible support			0
