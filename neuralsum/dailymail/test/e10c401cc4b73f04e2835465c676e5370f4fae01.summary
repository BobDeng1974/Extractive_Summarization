she was the most hated woman in @entity1 , loathed for her role in the break - up of the @entity4 and @entity6 ' marriage and vilified for everything from her dress sense to her looks			2
but 10 years on from the sunny april day that saw @entity12 become the @entity13 , things are looking very different for the 67 - year - old royal			1
indeed , so popular has @entity12 become , a recent poll revealed that not only is the @entity13 loved by 50 per cent of @entity1 , 56 per cent credit her with @entity18 ' own increasing popularity			1
that her relationship with the rest of the firm is so good is due , in no small part , to her ' charm and charisma ' , both of which got an appreciative mention from her husband during a recent interview with @entity45			2
the natural warmth she displays during public appearances has helped cement her place in the @entity28 , with courtiers impressed by her knack of creating an instant rapport with members of the public			1
most recently , she pulled off a tour of the @entity56 with aplomb , charming locals with her approachability and winning admiring headlines at home			2
her relaxed approach to life was in evidence once again during last month 's @entity65 where , accosted by ex-glamour model @entity66 in the paddock , she posed obligingly for a selfie			0
a few minutes later , she was seen engrossed in conversation with author @entity70 , who memorably based the caddish @entity71 , the star of the much - loved @entity73 , on @entity12 's ex-husband @entity74			1
sharing a joke : @entity12 and prince @entity29 share a joke at the opening ceremony of the @entity78 natural warmth : @entity12 's success is due to her charm - on display here during last month 's @entity65 involved : @entity12 's granddaughter @entity83 was a bridesmaid at the 2011 @entity84 ' she is warm , smiley and sincere , ' reveals one @entity87 insider			1
' if you were going to use five words to describe her , they would be funny , down - to - earth , opinionated , family - orientated and hearty			0
' but @entity12 's new - found confidence is hard - won			1
a salt - of - the - earth countrywoman who , given the opportunity , would happily go make - up free and avoid set - piece events , taking on the very public life of a senior royal has n't been easy			2
that she has managed it , apparently without breaking a sweat , has n't gone unnoticed - not least by @entity18 himself			0
' you can imagine it is a real , real challenge , ’ said the prince in the same @entity45 interview , adding : ' but she 's , i think , been brilliant in the way she 's tackled these things			0
insiders say the transformation is less about careful pr work and more about @entity12 herself - in particular , the way she has thrown herself into championing the charities closest to her heart			1
one of the first to benefit was the @entity119 , with whom the @entity13 has been involved for more than 19 years			0
' throughout our association with the @entity13 , she has been unwavering in her support , ' says chief executive @entity124			0
' she is personable , knowledgeable and compassionate			0
' all smiles : the @entity13 enjoys a chat with the @entity127 during the @entity128 all together : the @entity13 in the family photo released after @entity131 's christening close : the @entity13 now enjoys a close relationship with the queen approval : a clear sign of approval is the regularity with which the @entity13 appears alongside the queen shared interests : both @entity12 and the @entity31 share a passion for all things equestrian her interest in osteoporosis comes as no surprise to those who know the @entity13			1
in 1994 , aged 47 , she was forced to watch as her ' beloved @entity147 ' @entity146 died , slowly and in agony , as a result of the disease			0
indeed , the @entity12 's association with the charity pre-dates her marriage , with the @entity13 first getting involved while still mrs @entity74			1
asked to join forces with the charity while at the height of her infamy , biographer @entity157 writes that she was initially reluctant , fearing she might do more harm than good , before agreeing to get involved			0
although her first attempt at fundraising was curtailed by princess @entity6 's tragic death , she never stopped supporting the organisation and still gets involved in events			2
she has also made a name for herself as a champion of women 's rights , becoming deeply involved in the @entity1 's rape crisis centres and making a visit to a local women 's refuge part of every international tour			0
while visiting @entity175 capital @entity173 last november , she cut a sympathetic figure as she chatted to rape victims over a cup of tea at the @entity180			0
having a laugh : @entity12 , @entity30 and @entity127 share a joke on the balcony of @entity184 in june 2013 friendly : the @entity13 enjoys a friendly relationship with the @entity127 all smiles : the pair were frequently spotted together during the @entity189 in @entity191 last month , the @entity190 left prince @entity18 to his own devices for a couple of hours while she met detectives working for the @entity191 's @entity196			1
@entity12 's increasing confidence has also shown itself in the ensembles she wears , with the frumpy get - ups of old swapped for elegant tailored dresses designed to flatter her still - trim waist			1
like the @entity127 , she 's never far from a delicate cream dress and accessorises nearly everything she wears with one of her trademark five - strand pearl chokers			0
in the country , she likes tailored tweed suits by @entity209 , one of her favourite couturiers , cosy coats by @entity214 label @entity212 and flattering hats by @entity217 - based milliner , @entity218 but as the @entity13 prepares to celebrate her 10th wedding anniversary , it is the sea - change in her family life as much as her public image that ought to leave her smiling			0
mirror image : the two also share a similar sense of style - including a penchant for nude pumps cheers ! meanwhile @entity12 's relationship with prince @entity18 has gone from strength to strength charm : the @entity4 spoke glowingly of his wife 's ' charm and charisma ' in an interview last month not only is she close to the @entity31 , who was once reported as wishing she ' would just go away ' , @entity12 is also adored by @entity6 's sons @entity29 and @entity30 - as photos of the trio laughing together at the opening ceremony of september 's @entity78 made only too clear			1
' having initially loathed her , the @entity31 gets on well with @entity12 now , ' adds the insider			1
' she is n't as close to the @entity31 as @entity241 [ @entity241 ] is but that is partly because the @entity31 's relationship with @entity18 is a bit complicated anyway			1
' what certainly is n't complicated is @entity12 's relationship with @entity18			1
despite such quirks as maintaining separate country homes , after 10 years , the royal couple are closer - and happier - than ever			0
born @entity12 on the 17th july 1947 , the @entity13 's 67 years have undoubtedly been interesting ones			1
the daughter of @entity251 and his wife @entity252 , the @entity13 was born in @entity217 but spent much of her childhood in @entity254 along with her siblings , @entity256 and @entity257			0
according to her biographer @entity258 , her upbringing , although not royal , was certainly a grand one			0
' @entity12 is often described as having had an " @entity262 sort of @entity263 " , ' he writes			1
' in fact , it was much grander than that			0
' the @entity268 had position and they had help – help in the house , help in the garden , help with children			0
they opened their garden for the local @entity278 summer fête			0
' after a stint at a @entity214 finishing school , @entity12 burst onto the @entity217 social scene as a debutante on the 25th march 1965			1
but it was n't all fun , with the future @entity13 working as a secretary for a succession of @entity217 firms to pay for her @entity289 flat , which she shared with lady @entity291			0
in the late 1960s , @entity12 met the man who was to become her first husband , cavalry officer @entity74 , with the couple dating off and on for several years - with mr @entity74 striking up a relationship with princess @entity295 at one point			1
@entity12 , meanwhile , had struck up a relationship with prince @entity18 , who was first introduced to her sometime in 1971			2
when the couple split following an overseas posting for @entity18 in 1973 , @entity12 reconciled with @entity74 and the couple announced their engagement and married the same year			2
@entity304 in 1974 and @entity305 in 1978			0
but it was her continuing relationship with prince @entity18 that would come to define her , with the former couple remaining close friends even after both had married other people			2
in 1992 , claims that the two had remained an item throughout both marriages emerged when @entity6 : her @entity315 was published , followed , a year later by the ' @entity317 ' scandal			0
by 1995 , both marriages had come to an end and @entity18 and @entity12 were unofficially back together , with the future duchess often seen attending events with the prince			1
royal acceptance soon followed with the @entity31 making @entity12 part of the @entity326 celebrations in 2002			1
a year later , the @entity190 moved into @entity327 and on the 10th february 2005 , @entity18 and @entity12 's engagement was announced			2
the couple married just under two months later in @entity330 , with @entity12 taking the title of the @entity13 .			2

@entity12 is now one of the most popular members of the @entity28
she is close to her *stepsons* and is often seen joking with them at events
@entity339 has also won over the @entity31 and is said to be ' close ' to her
