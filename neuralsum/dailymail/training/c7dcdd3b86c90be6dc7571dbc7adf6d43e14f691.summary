by @entity0 published : 04:15 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 04:40 est , 8 august 2013 two rhinos have survived being drugged while their horns were sawn off using a battery powered hacksaw by poachers			1
the white rhinoceros , called @entity7 , were darted from the air with a powerful drug which left them paralysed - but still conscious of what was happening and able to feel the horrific pain of the entire episode			1
the poachers escaped with more than 15kg of horn , worth about £ 160,000			1
keepers said it is the first time they known rhinos to survive such an attack where the horns are separated from their skulls in this way			1
the incision was done with an amazing amount of precision and just one cut a centimetre further from the horn would have seen the rhinos bleed to death			2
head ranger @entity50 said : ' the horns were really cleanly cut off			0
' we believe the poachers used something like a hacksaw with a very thin blade which then gets rid of forensic evidence			0
there 's not much shavings or dust left behind			0
' because we 've been monitoring them so well and the police have been so good at what they 're doing , they 've had to resort to being this organised and sophisticated			0
the animals were darted from the air by poachers who then used a battery powered hacksaw to steal the horns @entity16 lost her unborn calf after the ordeal and @entity18 has been left partially blind and has organ problems head ranger @entity50 ( pictured giving medicine ) said poachers are becoming more sophisticated ' they ca n't just run around hacking horns off , it 's not that easy for them anymore so they 're coming up with new ideas			1
' a serious change is needed , if it carries on as it is now , within ten years the species will be extinct			0
that 's the white rhino and the black rhino - the rhino species will be extinct			2
' male rhino , @entity18 , has been left partially blind with severe kidney , liver , heart and lung damage as a result of the incident			1
@entity16 , the female rhino was four months pregnant and the stress of the poaching caused her to miscarry			1
both are now recovering with the help of the medical team at the @entity98			0
@entity98 vet , dr @entity99 , said whoever was involved had advanced knowledge and medical training in rhinoceros anatomy he said : ' when we were first called to the poaching of these two rhino we found @entity18 the bull in a very drugged state			1
the rhinos were left with scars and cuts to their body after they were butchered by poachers the rhinos were attacked as they grazed at @entity29 , in @entity30 , and are now recovering ' he was stumbling around but he was able to walk , he seemed to have use of all his legs which was surprising because the particular drugs that were used to poach these animals are very very potent			1
' i have never been called to living animals that have had their horns so neatly removed			0
' with these syndicates we know that the level of professionalism is very high because of the amount of organisation that goes behind orchestrating a poaching procedure like this			0
' @entity32 is a powerful paralysing agent that tricks the host into reacting to an infection of all of the major organs			0
a darted rhino will produce an extreme amount of white blood cells in a bid to fight the drug			2
this causes all muscles and blood vessels to become so saturated with white cells that they body locks up and can no longer function			0
experts fear this new tactic of shooting @entity32 from the air could spark a new trend amongst poachers .			2

the poachers made off with about £ 160,000 of rhino horn after the attack
white rhinos drugged from the air at @entity29 in @entity30
@entity16 lost her unborn calf and @entity18 left partially blind in ordeal
