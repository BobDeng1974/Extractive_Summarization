@entity1 's top female criminal prosecutor , @entity0 , will not face a scheduled inquiry by corruption body @entity3 due to start on monday , as a judge has delayed her bid to have the probe into allegations of perverting the course of justice halted			1
the corruption watchdog was due to open its three - day inquiry into the silk on monday over allegations she and her son @entity16 told his girlfriend @entity17 to fake chest pains to avoid a breath test after a car crash in may			1
after the allegations were aired , ms @entity0 sought urgent action in the @entity23 to shut the inquiry down			1
but justice @entity25 said on friday that he was unable to hand down a decision before the weekend , standing it over until monday at 2pm			0
@entity3 barrister @entity28 initially said the commission would be willing to hold off launching its hearing until 3pm on monday - an hour after @entity32 's expected decision			2
there should n't be a rush , ' he told the court			0
once the decision was handed down on monday , it was likely either party would appeal it , he said			0
following a short break , mr @entity69 said the commission " would not commence the public hearing prior to 10am on tuesday "			0
meanwhile , it was announced on friday that ms @entity0 had been elected to the @entity75 's governing body , the @entity74			2
in a show of support by her colleagues , the 55 - year - old deputy senior crown prosecutor garnered the second - highest number of votes with 387 nods , behind @entity83 's 441			0
speaking outside court , mr @entity84 said his client ' certainly got good support from members of the bar in terms of the vote '			0
mr @entity84 has previously attacked the @entity3 's pursuit of ms @entity0 , saying the watchdog had gone beyond its jurisdiction			1
but mr @entity69 said the @entity3 had a duty to investigate allegations she had perverted the course of justice because she was a public official			2
on thursday , ms @entity0 's counsel told the court @entity3 had no business investigating her private life			1
ms @entity0 launched the urgent action along with @entity16 , 26 and 25 - year - old girlfriend , ms @entity17			1
under fire : @entity16 ( pictured , right ) , ms @entity0 's 26 - year - old son and his girlfriend , @entity109 , 25 ( above , left ) are parties in the @entity112 action proceeding against the @entity3 , for which a decision has been delayed by the judge @entity84 , @entity115 , that just because she holds public office does n't mean she loses ' the rights of any other citizen when a matter arises in their personal life which has nothing to do with their public function '			1
he said neither ms @entity0 nor any other public official including ' dog catchers and rangers ' should lose their rights as private citizens			1
he said ms @entity0 's role as deputy senior crown prosecutor was ' irrelevant ' in the case of the car crash investigation			1
' you have a state body making a decision impacting on the rights of citizens , ' he said			0
seeking documents : @entity0 , @entity36 , has sought documents tracing the origin of the ' malicious complaint ' which landed her before a now delayed @entity3 hearing since the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) launched action against ms @entity0 last week , the widely respected @entity145 deputy senior crown prosecutor has received a groundswell of support from senior figures in the @entity1 legal fraternity			1
the @entity3 hearing to investigate allegations of perverting the course of justice against ms @entity0 is due to begin next monday			1
the action , which has been described as a ' witch hunt ' , could ' only be the result of a malicious complaint ' , the 55 - year - old mother of three sons told @entity161			2
ms @entity0 launched her @entity23 action on tuesday to challenge the @entity3 's power to investigate the claim , and to seek documents and a copy of the ' allegation or complaint ' which set off the @entity170 's investigation into ms @entity0 , her son and ms @entity17			1
mr @entity84 asked justice @entity172 to eject @entity3 from an active presence in the court proceedings , arguing it ' endangers the impartiality ' of the @entity170 to rule in the looming hearing against ms @entity0			1
' if the @entity170 becomes the protagonist it endangers their impartiality in subsequent hearings , ' mr @entity84 said			0
he said ms @entity0 and her fellow applicants were demanding @entity3 's reasons for mounting the investigation in the first place			1
' they do n't have any get out of jail free card , ' he said , ' they are accountable like anybody else			0
' but counsel for @entity3 , mr @entity69 , said the @entity170 would resist explaining in court as to why the charges of perverting the course of justice had been laid			2
mr @entity84 is seeking an order restraining the @entity3 from taking further steps in relation to the investigation , the reasons why the action was taken , and a declaration that the commission is acting outside its jurisdiction			0
the car crash at the centre of the @entity3 claims happened on may 31 , when ms @entity17 , 25 , was driving ms @entity0 's @entity205 and she was hit by another vehicle in @entity207 , on @entity39 's north shore			1
the @entity205 was knocked onto its side and ms @entity17 was trapped in her seat belt for some time			0
@entity161 understands once ms @entity17 was freed from the vehicle she called her boyfriend mr @entity16 , who called his father @entity214			0
mr @entity16 snr then told ms @entity0			2

she was taken to @entity227 where a blood test showed no alcohol in her system			0
ms @entity17 was not at fault in the accident			0
@entity161 has revealed that @entity3 investigators seized the mobile telephones of ms @entity0 , mr @entity16 and ms @entity17 in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident , on july 30			1
until that day , none of the trio was aware of any investigation into events following the crash , which happened in may			0
mr @entity16 and ms @entity17 were subsequently called to private @entity3 hearings in august			0
since @entity3 launched its action , there has been an outcry from legal figures including former @entity249 cabinet head , professor @entity248 , that the matter should have been investigated by police			2
justice @entity32 has previously ruled against @entity0 , in 2007 when she was prosecuting in the retrial of convicted gang rapist @entity253			2
one of three judges on the @entity255 , @entity32 ruled ms @entity0 should not participate in the retrial because she had made public statements about the case of @entity253 and his fellow gang rapists which would compromise ' appropriate fairness and detachment '			1
