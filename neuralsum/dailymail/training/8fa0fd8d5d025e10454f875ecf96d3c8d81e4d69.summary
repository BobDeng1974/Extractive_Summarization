@entity0 is a happy , healthy newborn			1
but there ’s something special about him – because he gives hope to thousands of women desperate to become mothers			2
his parents are the first in the world to benefit from a fertility test which promises to revolutionise @entity11 – and could be cheap enough for widespread use on the @entity13			1
the @entity15 dna test helps fertility doctors select only the best embryos			1
doing this could almost guarantee some women a baby			1
bundle of joy : @entity23 was conceived using the new fertility test developed at @entity15 his mother and father , @entity27 , 36 , and @entity28 , 41 , had been trying to start a family for five years and feared they would never have a baby			1
then @entity23 was born seven weeks ago weighing 7lb 15oz			2
miss @entity27 told the @entity32 : ‘ the first time i saw @entity23 , i was smashed with emotion			0
@entity28 and i are crazy , insanely in love with this kid			0
’ the couple , who live in @entity38 , took part in a small - scale trial of the test which aims to increase the success rates of @entity11			1
currently as few as a quarter of @entity11 attempts lead to a birth			1
@entity44 : @entity45 and @entity28 were delighted to have @entity23 after taking part in a small - scale trial of the test which aims to increase the success rates of @entity11 the test uses cutting - edge technology called next generation sequencing to find out whether embryos have just the right number of chromosomes			1
the @entity55 ’s annual conference heard that many eggs contain too many or too few chromosomes			0
this stops any pregnancy from taking place or leads to a miscarriage			0
having too many chromosomes can lead to conditions such as @entity65 ’s syndrome			0
examination : the test uses cutting - edge technology called next generation sequencing to find out whether embryos have just the right number of chromosomes therefore the test should also boost the odds of babies born by @entity11 being healthy			1
it would also cut the financial costs of @entity11			2
several tests are already available but @entity15 ’s dr @entity77 believes that his will be half the cost of its rivals			0
couples face paying up to £ 15,000 per course of @entity11 , plus £ 2,000 to £ 3,000 for chromosomal testing			2
the test can also look for genes behind rare diseases and assess the health of the mitochondria – the ‘ batteries ’ inside cells that turn the food we eat into energy			0
defects in these cause around 50 genetic diseases , many of which kill in infancy or lead to miscarriages			0
discovery the @entity15 ( pictured ) dna test helps fertility doctors select only the best embryos			1
doing this could almost guarantee some women a baby when all three features are taken into account , it is hoped the test will boost the odds of pregnancy by around a third			1
used on relatively young women in the best clinics , it could take the odds of pregnancy to almost 80 per cent per attempt			0
it is thought that the main beneficiaries of the test will be women in their 30s			2
the embryos of those aged 40 - plus carry more defects , so too few could be produced for the test to be used			2
a large - scale trial is planned for the @entity126 later this year which , if successful , could mean the test will be available through private clinics in as little as 18 months			0
however , some raised fears that the test could be exploited to give couples ‘ designer ’ babies with a certain eye or hair colour			0
@entity136 , of the @entity55 , warned that the law would have to be amended to limit the genes that could be hunted out by the test .			0

@entity0 was born using a revolutionary new fertility test
dna test helps fertility doctors select only the best embryos for @entity11
currently as few as a quarter of @entity11 attempts lead to a birth
this new test could almost guarantee some women a baby
