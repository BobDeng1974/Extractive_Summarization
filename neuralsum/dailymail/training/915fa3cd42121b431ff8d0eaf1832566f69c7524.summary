with 69.1 per cent of @entity2 adults now classified as overweight or obese according to the @entity3 , fat is becoming an increasingly weighty issue			1
but according to a new book , being overweight or obese might not be the problem most of us believe it to be			2
according to @entity12 cardiologist , @entity10 , it 's not fat that 's killing us - it 's dieting that does the most damage			1
not so bad : according to @entity17 , it 's perfectly possible to be overweight and ' amazingly healthy ' in @entity18 : when @entity19 and @entity20 , @entity10 argues that the key to good health is n't staying slender but keeping fit instead			1
speaking to the @entity23 , @entity10 said : ' fat has been demonised by our society , and our research shows fat is not always the devil			1
' you can be heavy and amazingly healthy			0
fitness is a lot more important than fatness			0
' his findings contradict received medical opinion , which claims that not only does obesity lead to type two diabetes and heart disease , it can also increase the risk of breast and colon cancer			2
while @entity10 accepts that being overweight does make heart disease more likely , he says larger people tend to have a better chance of surviving			2
' this is the obesity paradox , ' he explains			0
'' among the patients who have heart disease , the overweight and moderately obese are actually doing considerably better , sometimes 30 to 50 per cent lower mortality rates , than the lean people who have the same diseases			1
dangerous : according to the @entity3 , being obese can lead to type two diabetes , heart disease and cancer fighting fit : according to @entity17 , being fit makes more difference to heart health than weight he adds : ' in no way am i promoting obesity , but for the people who have been losing the battle of the weight , if they can at least become fit , then they can have a very good prognosis and good overall health			1
' while @entity10 's theories are the result of spending more than a decade treating heart patients at the @entity73 and @entity74 in @entity75 , they are unlikely to sway mainstream medical opinion which emphasises the need to lose weight and the £ 5bn annual cost to the @entity3 of treating the overweight			1
currently , the government is promoting a healthier lifestyle via a five a day eating campaign and is encouraging people to cut their sugar and fat intake			0
and the government is n't alone : a recent report by the @entity88 found that a quarter of @entity2 adults are now obese and warned that the figure looked set to double by 2050 at a cost of £ 50bn to the @entity2 exchequer			1
in contrast with dr @entity17 's findings , dr @entity96 , a cardiologist at @entity97 , @entity98 , told @entity99 that obesity was ‘ the greatest threat to health worldwide ’			2
he said poor diet was contributing to more disease than physical inactivity , smoking and alcohol combined , and accused junk food firms of adopting strategies of ‘ denial ’ and trying to confuse the public to ensure they carried on buying unhealthy products			0
professor @entity115 , chairman of the @entity88 , added : ‘ not only is the situation not improving , but the doomsday scenario set out in that report might underestimate the true scale of the problem			0
' there needs to be concerted action			0
we ’ve seen hard - hitting campaigns against smoking and it ’s time to back up the work that ’s already being done with a similar approach for obesity			0

claims were made by cardiologist @entity10 in his new book
says fitness , not weight , is the key to good health
paradoxically , says overweight patients had better survival rates
says he is n't promoting obesity but fitness - regardless of size
61.9 per cent of @entity2 adults are overweight and cost the @entity3 £ 5bn a year
new research shows 50 per cent of @entity2 *population* could be obese by 2050
@entity2 exchequer would have to spend £ 50bn a year treating health problems
