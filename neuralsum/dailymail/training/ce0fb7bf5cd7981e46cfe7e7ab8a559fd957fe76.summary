by @entity0 , defence correspondent published : 14:44 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 03:13 est , 10 july 2013 a @entity2 - run academy to train @entity4 military officers dubbed ' @entity5 in the sand ' could be axed if the @entity7 pulls all its troops from the warzone			1
some 170 @entity11 troops are set to teach cadets skills and discipline at a replica of the @entity15 being built in the desert at @entity17 , west of the @entity4 capital @entity19			1
the @entity20 , expected to open early next year , will focus on military tactics and leadership to defeat the @entity23			0
withdrawal : @entity25 , pictured visiting troops in @entity4 last month , has committed to pulling all combat personnel out of the country by the end of 2014 tactics : sources in @entity32 say president @entity33 is considering speeding up the @entity7 withdrawal from @entity4 but the centre would be jeopardised if president @entity33 carries out a threat to withdraw all @entity7 forces from the battlefield by the end of next year , experts have warned			1
the @entity42 is committed to ending combat operations on december 31 , 2014 , but planned to keep about 8,000 troops , including engineers , medics and air support , in @entity4 to back local forces			0
but cooling relations with @entity4 president @entity50 means president @entity33 is ' seriously considering ' speeding up the drawdown			1
it could lead to @entity32 taking the ' zero option ' of bringing every @entity7 serviceman and woman home and leaving @entity50 's forces to fend for themselves			1
politics : president @entity33 's relations with @entity4 's president @entity50 have cooled in recent months ' there 's always been a zero option , but it was not seen as the main option , ' a senior @entity62 official in @entity19 told the @entity67			1
' it is now becoming one of them , and if you listen to some people in @entity32 , it is maybe now being seen as a realistic path			0
' a full - scale pullout would have serious implications for prime minister @entity25 over his plan to open the ' @entity5 in the sand '			1
senior sources in @entity79 insisted the @entity11 remained ' committed ' to opening the academy but military commanders will urge politicians to reconsider the plan if the @entity7 withdraws all troops			1
top brass would question whether the safety of 170 @entity11 service personnel could be compromised if only a small number of @entity90 troops remain in the warzone			2
major @entity92 , who edits the @entity2 handbook , said : ' if the @entity7 pulled everything out we would have to pull out in parallel , and so would the @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and other @entity90 forces			0
it would be too dangerous to stay			0
' but he said the prospect was ' highly unlikely '			0
' this seems to be a bit of a kite - flying exercise by the @entity7 to concentrate @entity50 's mind on negotiations over security , ' said maj @entity92			2
the @entity7 and @entity4 have been in talks for months over a long - term security deal involving how many troops and bases the @entity90 - led coalition should leave in the war - torn country and the speed of the withdrawal			1
but the relationship between president @entity33 and president @entity50 reached a new low last month after the @entity7 attempted to begin peace talks with the @entity23			1
this led to president @entity50 suspending negotiations on the security pact , which could be worth as much as Â£ 5.3billion a year to @entity19			0
changes : @entity32 sources say @entity33 is considering leaving president @entity50 , pictured , to run @entity4 's security services himself reassurance needed : @entity79 sources have said if all @entity7 troops were to withdraw , @entity11 and other @entity90 forces would have to follow suit a june 27 video conference between the pair aimed at defusing tensions ended badly , according to @entity7 officials			1
they raised the prospect that the @entity7 could accelerate the drawdown to bring the bulk of the troops home next summer			2
the number of @entity7 troops in @entity4 - now around 63,000 - already is set to decline to 34,000 by february			2
but @entity4 played down the possibility of president @entity33 ordering a complete withdrawal			2
one senior official in @entity19 said : ' both sides understand how to pressure each other			0
but both the @entity7 and @entity4 fully understand the need for foreign troops , especially @entity7 ones , to stay beyond 2014			2
' that it is vital for security here and in the wider region			0
we do n't think the @entity7 will compromise on that , because past experience of abandoning @entity4 was that the country descended into chaos			0
' last month it was revealed that @entity11 was coming under pressure to keep additional troops in @entity4 for up to five years after the end of combat operations in 2014			0
a senior military commander said @entity90 personnel would be needed to provide medical evacuation and logistics , plan helicopter operations and integrate ground combat with air support .			0

around 170 troops committed to opening of new academy in @entity19
military school in desert at @entity17 dubbed ' @entity5 in the sand '
but @entity32 sources say @entity33 is considering speeding up withdrawal
