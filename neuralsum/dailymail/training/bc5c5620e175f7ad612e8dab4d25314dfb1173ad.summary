by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:44 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 05:35 est , 5 august 2013 working away from home can be lonely , especially if you are 220 miles above @entity4 on the @entity5			2
but @entity7 designers have come up with a way to stop the astronauts from feeling isolated - the world 's first talking robot astronaut			1
kirobo - derived from the @entity7 words for ' hope ' and ' robot ' - has been sent into space to keep astronaut @entity16 company			1
although he will be joined by five flight engineers , including two @entity30 , two @entity31 and one @entity32 , researchers hope that being able to talk with @entity20 in @entity7 will keep his spirits up			1
the robot was among five tons of supplies and machinery on a cargo rocket headed for the @entity5 which was launched into space from an island off @entity7 today			1
robot designer @entity40 , of the @entity41 , advertiser @entity42 and car maker @entity43 worked on the robot , which will communicate with another robot on @entity4 while in space			0
he said the challenge was making sure it could move and talk where there was no gravity			0
' @entity30 was the first to go to outer space , the @entity31 was the first to go to the moon , we want @entity7 to be the first to send a robot - astronaut to space that can communicate with humans , ' said @entity56 , the @entity20 project manager			1
lift off : the unmanned cargo rocket carrying @entity20 takes off from @entity58 cargo : the rocket contains five tonnes of machinery and supplies for the @entity5 history : the launch marked the first time a talking robot astronaut has been sent into space humanoid : @entity20 will act as a companion for @entity7 astronaut @entity16 , who will become commander of the @entity5 later this year mr @entity40 said he hopes robots like @entity20 that hold conversations will eventually be used to assist astronauts working in space			1
' when people think of robots in outer space , they tend to seek ones that do things physically , ' he said			0
' but i think there is something that could come from focusing on humanoid robots that focus on communication			0
' because @entity20 does not need to perform physical activities , it is smaller than most robots that go into space			2
it is about 34cms tall and weighs about 1kg			0
ahead of the launch on saturday , @entity20 told reporters : ' one small step for me , a giant leap for robots			0
' launch : the robot was sent into space on a @entity100 rocket which set off at 04.48am local time companion : @entity20 ( right ) will be speak @entity7 with astronaut @entity16 ( left ) at the @entity5 @entity7 boasts the most sophisticated robotics in the world , but because of its ' manga ' culture , it tends to favour cute robots with human - like characteristics with emotional appeal			1
mr @entity40 said sending a robot into space could help write a new chapter in the history of communication			0
' i wish for this robot to function as a mediator between person and machine , or person and @entity121 and sometimes even between people , ' he said			0
@entity7 has an ageing population and there is hope that in the future robots like @entity20 could be used as companions for elderly people in their homes and in nursing homes			2
@entity131 : because @entity20 does not perform physical activities , it is smaller than most robots that go into space			2
