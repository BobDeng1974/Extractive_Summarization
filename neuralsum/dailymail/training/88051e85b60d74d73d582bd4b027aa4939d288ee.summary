@entity6 , who was born @entity7 , joined the macho world of the military aged just 16 in a desperate bid to suppress her feelings			1
as a member of the @entity14 , the 47 - year - old served in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity6 , who was born @entity7 , joined the military aged 16 in a desperate bid to suppress her feelings but always knew she wanted to be a woman during @entity7 ’s military career , he went through many hardships - including witnessing one of his colleagues being blown up in front of his eyes			1
but throughout his time in the @entity39 , the desire to become a woman never left him and when he was discharged from the army in 2005 he finally embarked upon gender reassignment therapy			1
@entity6 had her last operation in 2011 and says now that she is officially a woman , she has never been happier with her life			1
she has even set up her own business specialising in tyre repairs , inspired by her time spent in the army			1
the ex-squaddie , who grew up in @entity48 , @entity49 , but now lives in @entity50 , @entity51 , said : ' from a young age i always knew i was different			2
' but it was the 1980s and where i came from you got strung up even if you were gay			2
' there was n’t the same help and information there is today			2
the young squaddie knew he was different from a young age but attempted to suppress his feelings ' i was not happy with who i was but i did the opposite of what i wanted to do			1
i tried to become a man			0
' it was also the middle of the thatcher - era , there were no jobs and i had a difficult home life			0
i needed to get out			0
' @entity7 had been withdrawn at school , knowing that he was different from everyone else and was bullied by other children because he was small for his age and wore glasses			1
not getting on with his family , who he is still estranged from , he was eager to leave home			0
aged just 16 , @entity7 threw himself into army life and quickly got promoted , but he never felt as though he belonged			1
@entity7 was bullied by other children at school because he was small for his age and wore glasses she added : ' i had always found it difficult in the army			1
some of the lads had massive groups of friends , but i never did			0
' i just stuck to a few acquaintances , not wanting to get too close to anyone			0
' but so much was going on , i managed to push my feelings to the back of my mind			1
it was a very macho , back - slapping kind of environment with a lot of drinking in the bar and towards the end i felt as though i was putting on an act all the time			2
' there was pressure to behave like the rest of them , and to be a man			0
' after i got promoted i tried hard just to get on with things , i was high - up so i gave orders and did n’t mix that much with the other lads			0
' @entity7 was discharged due to an eye infection in 2005 having reached the position of quartermaster sergeant at @entity112 , @entity113			1
in his last few years of his career , he had established the armoured vehicle fleet at @entity112 where he was in command of 72 vehicles and their drivers			0
but the infection had left him needing a corneal transplant and as a result his sight was permanently impaired , meaning he was no longer fit for service			2
it was then that @entity7 seriously started thinking about having a sex change			1
he had never discussed his feelings with anyone before but that same year he visited his gp and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria			2
@entity6 then started having counselling and taking hormone tablets at the start of a six - year process			1
she funded the sex change herself , forking out £ 4,000 for a boob job but says she encountered prejudice along the way			1
while she was going through the transition neighbours she had told were supportive but some locals vandalised her car and house			0
throughout his time in the armed forces , the desire to become a woman never left him and when he was discharged from the army in 2005 he finally embarked upon gender reassignment therapy @entity6 said : ' some people accepted me and some would not			1
i drifted from job to job , it was difficult to get a job in the first place			0
' i worked in call centres , but i finally got fed up when rumours started circulating that i was working as an escort			0
' i had tough times and sometimes turned to drink to escape			0
' over the years , @entity6 has had relationships with both men and women , although she prefers women			1
she says she finds it difficult to meet people and is single at the moment , but is open to dating			0
she added : ' it ’s hard enough to find someone these days when you are straight , so i find it particularly challenging			0
' now @entity6 has completed her transition from a man to a woman and gained the confidence to open her own business she is starting to feel accepted			1
she added : ' i am happier now than i have ever been			0
it has been a lot of hard work , but it has definitely been worth it			0
' i have had a great response , and people appear to be a lot more accepting towards me			0
' i do n’t get many problems now , but there are always going to be people who will have a go , no matter how much you try to blend in			0
' i try not to let it bother me , and as a whole i feel as though i get a positive response from the people i meet			0
@entity7 did n't have many friends during his time in the army and kept himself to himself but feels much happier in his new body ' the only thing i wish is that i had taken the plunge earlier			1
apart from anything else the earlier you start the better the result is			0
' but really i am just happy that i have done it at all			0
' @entity6 ’s @entity50 - based business @entity201 provides a service which permanently fixes punctures			1
she said : ' i got the idea from working with vehicles during my time in the army			2
but also i suffered a lot of tyre damage when i was going through my transition and people kept vandalising my car , putting nails in my tyres			2
' the sealant i use permanently seals punctures as you drive , it maintains tyre pressure and helps save fuel			2
' it ’s early days at the moment and i am hoping the business takes off , then life really will be good			2
