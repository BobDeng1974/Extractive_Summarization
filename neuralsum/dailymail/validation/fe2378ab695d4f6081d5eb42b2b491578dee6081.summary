@entity3 baristas will no longer be encouraged to write ' @entity4 ' on customers ' cups , the coffee chain 's ceo @entity0 has said today			1
the last day workers will write the messages is on march 22 as the initiative , which was accused of using racial tensions to boost its bottom line , will continue more broadly without the handwritten notes			1
@entity3 spokesman @entity14 said the phase out is not a reaction to the push back the chain has received over its campaign			1
' nothing is changing , ' he said			0
' it 's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned			1
' the campaign , announced on tuesday , received much criticism including that it was opportunistic and inappropriate , as it came in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males			2
others questioned whether @entity3 workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks			2
' while there has been criticism of the initiative - and i know this has n't been easy for any of you - let me assure you that we did n't expect universal praise , ' his statement said			1
' the heart of race together has always been about humanity : the promise of the @entity67 should be available to every person in this country , not just a select few			0
the six - time @entity71 champion wrote that @entity3 ' ' race together ' campaign left him in ' shock and awe ' ' we leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most			1
we are learning a lot			0
and will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most			0
' the initiative previously encouraged workers to write ' @entity4 ' on cups and to also strike up conversations with customers about race			1
@entity39 said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was ' just the catalyst ' for a larger conversation			1
he also said this part of the campaign was always scheduled to end on sunday			2
@entity3 will still hold forum discussions , co-produce special sections in @entity99 and put more stores in minority communities as part of the race together initiative , wrote @entity39			1
six - time @entity71 champion @entity105 spoke out in defence of @entity39 and the company 's campaign , saying the concept left him in ' shock and awe			1
' ' @entity3 ceo @entity0 's bold decision to encourage his baristas to discuss race relations with willing customers has filled me with shock and awe , ' he wrote in his time magazine column			1
' i 'm in awe of his courageous and good - hearted attempt to do something to bring about better awareness of racism			0
' i 'm in awe that he 's willing to put morality above profits			0
i 'm in awe that he 's willing to endure the snarky ridicule and lame coffee jokes from pundits as well as the inevitable death threats from clueless trolls			2
all with nothing personally or corporately to gain â€” and a lot to lose			0
' but while in awe of his chutzpah , i 'm also in shock that he thinks this will actually work			0
' @entity105 , who at 67 has expanded his talents beyond basketball to become a celebrated writer , actor and filmmaker quoted @entity148 as he praised @entity3 ' ' noble goal			2
' ' progress is impossible without change , and those who can not change their minds can not change anything , ' he quoted			0
however , @entity105 admitted he has serious concerns with how @entity3 are attempting to bring about change			2
defense : @entity3 ceo @entity0 told @entity158 on thursday that he is simply trying to use the company 's reach for good with its new ' race together ' campaign ' the problem with @entity0 's race together program is that he 's picked the wrong venue with the wrong audience using the wrong spokespersons			1
' most of the customers at @entity3 probably do n't want to have their political awareness challenged by the person foaming their coffee			2
minds are more likely to be changed by someone with some form of expertise in the subject , which baristas generally do n't have			0
' the former @entity71 all - star also wrote that he admired @entity39 's courage and applauded his initiative but worried that such conversations ' could quickly escalate to violence			1
' @entity105 even likened @entity39 to the highly moral character of @entity3 in @entity186 trying to stop the blasphemous actions of @entity188			1
' as another character warns , ' you 're in dangerous waters , mr. @entity3 ! come on over ; come about			2
' support : @entity39 was joined on stage at the annual meeting by rapper common , who also spoke about the importance of engaging with people from different backgrounds in support of the campaign ridiculed : after the campaign was announced , @entity202 users slammed the idea as naive ' do n't stop trying , mr. @entity3 , ' wrote @entity105			1
@entity39 has defended the ridiculed campaign as ' very genuine '			2
during @entity3 ' annual shareholders meeting in @entity44 on wednesday , @entity39 said the company is simply trying to use its massive reach for good			1
' some in the media will criticize @entity3 for having a political agenda , ' he said			2
' our intentions are pure			0
' speaking on @entity215 on thursday , he added : ' this is a highly charged , highly emotional issue , we understand that			0
a letter from @entity0 to @entity219 regarding race together : dear partners , i want to offer my heartfelt thanks to every one of you for your fearless and energetic support of the race together initiative			1
our objective from the very start of this effort -- dating back to our first open forum in @entity44 last december -- was to stimulate conversation , empathy and compassion toward one another , and then to broaden that dialogue beyond just our @entity3 family to the greater @entity240 public by using our scale for good			2
after a historic @entity243 that focused on diversity and inequality , and an initial push for much - needed national discussion around these difficult topics , it is time for us to take stock of where we are , what we have learned from our efforts so far , and what is next			2
this phase of the effort -- writing ' race together ' ( or placing stickers ) on cups , which was always just the catalyst for a much broader and longer term conversation -- will be completed as originally planned today , march 22			1
but this initiative is far from over			0
we have a number of planned race together activities in the weeks and months to come : more partner open forums , three more special sections co-produced with @entity99 over the course of the next year , more open dialogue with police and community leaders in cities across our country , a continued focus on jobs and education for our nation 's young people plus our commitment to hire 10,000 opportunity youth over the next three years , expanding our store footprint in urban communities across the country , and new partnerships to foster dialogue and empathy and help bridge the racial and ethnic divides within our society that have existed for so many years			1
while there has been criticism of the initiative -- and i know this has n't been easy for any of you -- let me assure you that we did n't expect universal praise			1
the heart of race together has always been about humanity : the promise of the @entity67 should be available to every person in this country , not just a select few			0
we leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most			0
we are learning a lot			0
and will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most			0
i want to thank those of you who took time this week to share what you were seeing , hearing , feeling and thinking as we rolled out race together across the country			2
an issue as tough as racial and ethnic inequality requires risk - taking and tough - minded action			0
and let me reassure you that our conviction and commitment to the notion of equality and opportunity for all has never been stronger			0
take care of yourselves and each other			0
i am proud to be your partner			0
with great respect , @entity0 source : @entity3 ' we 've tried to be very thoughtful , very genuine , very authentic and recognize that by leveraging our stores , potentially , we can elevate the conversation and make a positive difference			1
' he said that he was not surprised by the backlash but that if the company 's workers can ' elevate the understanding and the empathy with one customer per day ' , he will be satisfied			1
after the campaign was announced , @entity202 ruthlessly mocked @entity3			2
one user tweeted : ' i do n't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train			0
' another added : ' # @entity348 is what happens when a 1 % - er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life ' white man 's burden ' crisis			0
' controversial : the new campaign encourages workers to write ' @entity4 ' on customer 's cups and to strike up conversations about race			1
pictured , customer @entity361 shows off one of the new stickers an executive on @entity3 ' communications team , @entity365 , even blocked people on @entity202 before temporarily taking down his account after being bombarded with criticism over the campaign			1
@entity370 later said in a post on medium that he felt he was being ' personally attacked in a cascade of negativity ' and that he had gotten overwhelmed , but later reactivated the account			0
when @entity158 asked @entity39 about some of the scathing criticism on thursday , @entity39 responded : ' well , you know what i say to that - no good deed goes unpunished			1
' he has explained that workers do not have to participate in the campaign , and that stores can make customers another drink or cover up cups if they do n't like the message			0
inserting itself into national issues is not new territory for @entity3 in late 2012 , the chain asked workers to write ' come together ' on cups to send a message to lawmakers about stalled budget negotiations			1
and in 2013 , the chain placed newspaper ads saying that firearms were not welcome in its cafes after they became the site of gun rallies			0
but the company stopped short of an outright ban			0
@entity39 said at the time that @entity3 was neither for nor against guns , underscoring that even a company that wants a voice in national conversations has to be careful about alienating customers			1
questions : another @entity202 user pointed out the lack of diversity in the campaign material			0

on sunday , @entity3 ceo @entity0 sent out letter saying that baristas will not write the messages on cups after march 22
coffee chain 's ' @entity426 ' campaign , was slammed on social media and was accused of using racial tensions to boost its bottom line
