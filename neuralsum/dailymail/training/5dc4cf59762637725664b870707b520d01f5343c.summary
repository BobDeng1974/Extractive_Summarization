gov @entity17 announced @entity19 ’s resignation on tuesday in a news release while stating no mention of the investigation nor any admitted wrongdoing			0
' she was concerned that she had become more of a focus than the children the department serves , ' @entity17 said in the release			0
he was n't immediately available to comment			0
the @entity29 governor last week defended @entity2 's leadership , even after the agency told a federal judge it could n't say with any certainty how many children died while in its custody			1
the department previously reported the deaths of 151 children in their custody between january of 2009 and july of 2012 but retracted that number after a third party reported that number to be less than exact			1
they now say they are not sure how many have died			0
according to the @entity45 in the first six month of 2012 there were 31 deaths among children , ranging from newborns to teenagers			2
the deaths originally reported by @entity3 included infants , toddlers , grad - schoolers and teenagers			1
the causes of death included bodily fractures or injuries , gunshot wounds , natural causes and drug exposure			0
@entity3 had since been sued by @entity45 , the @entity62 and 10 other news organizations to obtain case records of those 151 children and had been the subject of state investigations of abuse or neglect			1
' it ’s something the public has a right to know about as it pertains to the safety of children , ' @entity70 managing editor @entity69 told the @entity45			0
@entity19 previously said that the names are being kept secret ‘ not to protect @entity3 , they ’re really to protect the families , ’ according to the newspaper			1
chancellor @entity80 ruled last month that @entity3 , which had claimed it was keeping the records closed to protect the children 's privacy , had to release hundreds of pages from four cases to the news organizations after identifying information was redacted			1

numbers : the department , pictured , admitted to the deaths of 151 children in their custody between january of 2009 and july of 2012 before redacting that figure that was later accused as too low attorneys for the agency last week said it would cost at least $ 55,584.55 to make all records publicly available			1
they tallied costs including extra administrative assistants for filing and copying , extra paralegals , hand transportation across state , and enormous supplies of white out			0
@entity3 has been under federal court oversight for more than a decade over problems in @entity12 's foster care system			2
less than two weeks ago @entity3 told a federal judge that it could n't accurately count how many children have died in its custody , saying its tracking system had missed nine deaths in 2011 and 2012			1
in december a quarter of the state ’s child abuse hotline were also found going unanswered , the @entity45 reported			2
the revelation and increasing calls for @entity3 to improve its performance have threatened to derail more than 10 years of work to resolve a long - running lawsuit over the agency 's handling of foster care			2
thus far , officials have not been able to explain how @entity3 overlooked the nine deaths except to say that it was the result of human error			2
@entity3 ’ operations are currently being monitored by a third party which was the first to discover the additional unreported deaths according to @entity138			0
the department is now trying to get out of that consent order			0
@entity17 has named commissioner @entity141 , the head of the @entity143 , to serve as interim commissioner of @entity3			2

before that she was president and chief executive officer of @entity12 in @entity148 .			0

@entity2 has served as commissioner of state 's @entity3 since january of 2011
