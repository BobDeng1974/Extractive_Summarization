online auction site @entity0 has been blasted for an ' inexcusable delay ' in taking action after it was revealed that its servers were hacked three months ago - compromising the personal details of 15 million @entity7 users			1
the email , home addresses , passwords , phone numbers and birth dates of every @entity0 account holder - 233 million worldwide - are now in the hands of the hackers			1
the company has told users to urgently change their passwords amid the biggest criminal raid ever carried out online			0
@entity0 is requesting that all users change their passwords			2
earlier today , a message was posted under the headline ' @entity0 to ask all @entity22 to @entity23 '			2
the only text in the body of the post was ' placeholder text			0
' it was taken down within hours the @entity0 database was hacked between late february and early march			1
it gave hackers access to encrypted passwords and other non-financial data			1
this included @entity0 customers ' name , encrypted password , email address , home address , phone number and date of birth			1
however , the database did not contain financial information or other confidential personal data			0
cyber attackers accessed the information after obtaining ‘ a small number of employee login credentials ’			2
the online market place added that it had no evidence of there being unauthorised activity on its members ' accounts			0
but security experts are warning hackers could still use personal details to commit identity fraud			1
@entity0 became aware of the hack a fortnight ago but is still unsure exactly how it happened			0
it is unclear why it has taken @entity0 so long to make users aware of breach			2
it has been revealed that hackers accessed @entity0 databases by using the accounts of company employees as long ago as february			1
@entity69 have rounded on the @entity71 company for the ' inexcusable delay ' in informing its customers			0
@entity74 , the chairman of the @entity75 home affairs select committee , told the @entity78 : ' we have urged companies to take much more seriously the threat of hacking			0
it is inexcusable that a company as important as @entity0 has failed to inform its customers immediately that this has occurred			2
we need a full explanation			0
' we will be writing to them to ask how this happened and whether this problem has been resolved			0
' in a statement on their website , the @entity71 auction site said it was asking all its users to reset their passwords after an attack ‘ compromised a database containing encrypted passwords and other non-financial data ’			2
often consumers use their @entity0 password for a host of other websites , including their banks , so they may also need to make changes to these to protect their accounts from being hijacked			1
@entity106 , the chief executive at @entity107 , said that the online auction site was the ' golden goose of hacking targets ' due to the sheer amount of information which is held			0
he said that the damage could have already been done and warned that while hackers may not be taking money or goods out of @entity0 - they may be using personal information to target other sites			1
an @entity0 spokesman said : ' we discovered unauthorised access to our corporate network earlier in may and immediately began a forensic investigation which discovered this issue leading to yesterday ’s announcement			1
' @entity0 is a global marketplace and this thorough investigation worked as quickly as possible			0
' the company owns and runs the internet payment system @entity131 , but claimed that this was not involved in the raid , saying : ‘ @entity131 data is stored separately on a secure network , and all @entity131 financial information is encrypted			1
’ the firm has 128million active users and accounted for £ 126billion worth of commerce in 2013			0
shares in the web giant , which has more than 14million active users in the @entity7 , fell by 3.2 per cent in early trading yesterday amid fears that the company will lose the trust of their customers , leading to a downturn in trade and profits			0
a spokesman added : ‘ working with law enforcement and security experts , the company is aggressively investigating the matter and applying the best forensics tools and practices to protect customers			1
‘ information security and customer data protection are of paramount importance to @entity0 , and @entity0 regrets any inconvenience or concern that this password reset may cause our customers			1
’ the auction site added that it had no evidence of there being unauthorised activity on its members ' accounts			0
but security experts are warning hackers could still use personal details to commit identity fraud the cyber attack was made between late february and early march , giving hackers access to @entity0 customers ' name , encrypted password , email address , physical address , phone number and date of birth			1
the firm said it will be emailing users later today to inform them of the breach ‘ our customers are our highest priority ; and to ensure they continue to have a safe , secure and trusted experience on @entity0 , we will be asking all users to change their passwords			1
‘ there is no evidence that any financial information was accessed or compromised ; but we are taking every precaution			0
’ but @entity199 , independent security expert , said : ‘ obviously they ’ve got hold of names , addresses and dates of birth			0
all of this can be used to commit identity fraud			1
‘ if they have your password , and you have the same password for other websites , hackers could access your email , your @entity215 account and who knows what else			1
’ and internet security expert @entity106 said : ‘ @entity0 users must act and follow the advice to change their passwords			1
but the damage could have already been done , as the time lag is months between the cyber breach and the discovery of the breach			0
‘ it could well have been viewed as the golden goose of hacking targets			0
its popularity means that it holds personal details , making its a potential gold mine			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity231 may not hit the obvious target of siphoning money or goods out of @entity0 ; they may take the personal information gained from the database and target other popular sites			2
’ the internet is still recovering from the @entity240 bug , a flaw in the @entity243 encryption on computers that protects user information when someone is online			0
the flaw had been present for two years undetected , and offered hackers a way into personal accounts across the web			2
@entity7 parenting website @entity252 was the first to admit they had been a victim of the bug			0
fixes , or ‘ patches ’ , have since been applied across the web as sites recover from the breach in security			0
what personal details were stolen ? hackers gained access to @entity0 customers ' names , encrypted passwords , email addresses , physical addresses , phone numbers and dates of birth			1
it is unclear whether all , or any , of the details were taken but security experts are warning people to assume the worst			1
are my credit cards details safe ? the firm said that the infiltrated part of the network did not contain any financial details , so in theory , yes			2
will changing my password solve the problem ? changing passwords will stop hackers from being able to use any login details that were stolen			2
however , they could still use names , addresses and birth dates to commit identity fraud			1
it ’s a good idea to change passwords following any attack such as this			0
it ’s also important to update login details on any sites that use the same password			0
if a hacker has your password and email address they could use it to attempt to access other sites that use the same combination			1
as a rule , the same password should never be used across different sites			0
should i change my @entity131 password as well ? @entity131 , which owns @entity0 , has confirmed its accounts and customers have not been affected by this cyber attack			1
however , as a matter of course , it ’s good practice to change all related passwords across different sites , including @entity131			0
which countries are affected ? at the moment , we can assume that all @entity0 customers worldwide will be affected by this breach , until @entity0 says otherwise			1
is this hack a result of the @entity240 bug ? when @entity240 was exposed , @entity0 announced its customer ’s account were secure and had not been affected			2
this suggests the latest hack is a separate attack			0
how did hackers steal the information ? it is unclear how the hackers got hold of the information but @entity0 said it is working with forensic teams to get an answer to this question			2
why did it take so long for @entity0 to inform customers of the breach ? @entity346 has contacted @entity0 for an answer to this question			2
it is unclear what caused the delay			0
typically , following cyber attacks , a firm will investigate the breach to try and determine how many people are affected , and the severity of the attack , before issuing advice			2
early reports claimed the password change on @entity0 could be as a result of the worldwide @entity240 security breach last month , but @entity131 said at the time its servers were n't at risk and had not been affected			1

attack made between february and march and affects 128 million users
hackers infiltrated the corporate network after stealing employee logins
this gave hackers access to @entity0 customers ' name , encrypted password , email address , home address , phone number and date of birth
firm said there is no evidence to suggest @entity131 accounts were affected
but security experts are warning hackers could still use personal details to commit identity fraud - even after the password has been changed
