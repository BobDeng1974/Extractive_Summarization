controversial ‘ @entity1 ’ crops could be grown in @entity3 fields from next year after the @entity4 yesterday voted for a new approvals process			2
the system will allow each country to decide for itself whether or not to grow a @entity9 crop – once it has been ruled safe by @entity10 , which is the @entity12 ’s food safety body			1
most of @entity14 , including @entity15 and @entity16 , wants to ban the crops amid concerns over their impact on the environment , food and human health			1
however , the governments of @entity3 and @entity24 support the technology and are keen to see the crops in the fields and on dinner plates as soon as possible			1
@entity4 voted that each country should decide for itself whether or not to grow a @entity9 crop - once it has been ruled safe by @entity10 , the @entity12 's food safety body ( file photo ) the conservatives , @entity34 and @entity35 in @entity36 all support the growing of @entity9 crops , despite widespread public opposition			1
by contrast , the administrations in @entity41 , @entity42 and many local councils oppose the technology having seen the problems that have emerged in the @entity47			0
there , superweeds have developed that are difficult to control , leading to the need for ever more powerful chemical weedkillers , while important species like the monarch butterfly are under threat			0
critics fear that pollen from @entity9 plants will spread to other conventional and organic crops , as well as honey , so polluting the entire food chain			2
the first @entity9 crops to be grown here could be varieties of corn or maize created by the labs of @entity68 and @entity69 , which are modified to give them protection from the weedkiller glyphosate , also known as @entity73			1
the idea is that these crops can be blanket sprayed with the chemical which will kills off any weeds but allows the corn to grow			0
once a @entity9 crop is approved by the @entity12 and @entity3 government as safe , any farmer in @entity81 will be allowed to grow it , regardless of any objections from people in the area			1
the only restrictions will surround the need to minimise the spread of pollen from the crop to neighbouring farms			0
this will involve setting official ‘ separation distances ’ between the @entity9 and other crops , which will differ depending on the plants involved			2
the government has not decided what these separation distances should be			0
any farmer where pollen does spread to pollute crops belonging to another person is at risk of being sued for the resulting loss in value			0
an organic farmer whose crop became contaminated may find it loses its status and value if contaminated with @entity9 genes			0
advocates claim that – in the future – @entity9 technology could ‘ feed the world ’ by allowing crops to be grown in areas of drought or create plants that are high in beneficial nutrients			2

critics fear that pollen from @entity9 plants will spread to other conventional and organic crops as well as honey , which could pollute the entire food chain ( file photo ) professor @entity135 , professor of molecular genetics at the @entity137 , welcomed the decision by @entity139 , saying it would speed the commercial cultivation of @entity9 crops			1
he said : ‘ devolving decisions down to national level will allow each country to make up their own mind and thereby free up @entity9 technology from the pressure of intense @entity150 lobbying at the centre of the @entity12			1
‘ farmers and consumers across the @entity12 will be more accepting of gm technology when they can see its benefits across their borders			0
’ @entity158 campaigner @entity157 said the new rules ‘ could open the door to @entity9 crops being grown in @entity81 ’			1
she said : ‘ successive @entity3 governments have consistently championed @entity9 crops and food - despite the fact that this technology has been hugely over-hyped and delivered little			1
’ @entity167 , @entity168 for @entity169 who voted against the proposals , said that despite giving @entity12 countries new powers to ban @entity9 in their territories , the move would mean more @entity9 crops for the @entity3			1
‘ this is because our pro-gm government are now able to give the go - ahead to more authorisations , ’ he said			0
‘ i remain convinced that @entity9 organisms cause contamination of crops , are bad for our health and that small scale sustainable agriculture is the answer to solving future food shortages			2
’ the new arrangements are largely the work of the @entity191 campaigner and former @entity194 food and farming secretary , @entity195 , who was sacked last year			0
he , along with ministers from @entity24 , led the drive in @entity199 to speed the commercial growing of @entity9 crops			1
the policy sprang out of a series of secret briefings between ministers , their civil servants and the @entity9 industry ’s @entity207 , which began in the summer of 2012			0
ministers subsequently promised incentives for investment , a strategy for biotech and , most significantly , efforts to reduce regulation and speed up @entity9 crop approvals , which came to fruition yesterday			0
@entity217 , policy director at the @entity218 said : ‘ the @entity12 proposal fails to require countries to ensure that any @entity9 crops grown will not contaminate @entity9 free farms			1
’ he added : ‘ the commercial @entity9 crops currently in the pipeline for @entity14 are not those with traits associated with " feeding the world "			1
they are crops engineered by @entity9 companies to be resistant to weed killers that they too have manufactured			2
‘ the use of these in the @entity47 has led to huge problems with resistant weeds , and an increase in the use of pesticides			0
yields from @entity9 crops are lower than @entity241 , and in the @entity47 @entity9 crops are damaging wildlife			2
the monarch butterfly , one of the wonders of the world , is at threat thanks to these crops			0

the @entity12 's food safety body will have the power to rule @entity9 crops safe
each country will decide for itself whether or not to grow ' *frankenfoods* '
most of @entity14 wants to ban the genetically modified crops amid concerns over their impact on the environment , food and human health
but @entity3 and @entity24 are keen to see @entity9 foods on dinner plates as soon as possible
