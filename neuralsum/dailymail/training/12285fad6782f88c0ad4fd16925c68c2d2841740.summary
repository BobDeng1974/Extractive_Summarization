by @entity0 attacked : @entity1 wants her attacker charged with attempted murder a female diver claims she was attacked thursday while 50 feet underwater off the coast of @entity7 , and has the video to prove it			1
@entity1 , 53 , of @entity9 , is calling for the man who ripped the air supply out of her mouth to be charged with attempted murder after an altercation that she says almost killed her			1
‘ this man needs to be arrested , ’ she told @entity18			0
‘ i think this man needs to be arrested immediately for attempted murder			0
’ @entity1 claims she encountered her attacker – who is named in a separate article , but @entity24 is withholding his name because he has yet to be charged – while documenting damage to coral reefs just off the coast			1
video of the incident shows a diver quickly swim towards her and rip out her oxygen line			2
she eventually got it back in again , but then he came back for more			0
‘ i got up on the boat and i said oh my @entity40 , someone just tried to kill me underwater			2
’ the environmental activist says she has taken more than 10,000 dives in her life , and that experience is what kept her from dying			1
‘ an inexperienced diver would likely panic			2
@entity49 panic from the stress of the situation and shoot for the surface , she explained			0
‘ they may panic because their air source is missing and they ca n't find it			0
any of those things causes a diver to shoot for the surface and those incidents often lead to death			2
’ terrifying : @entity1 is approached by another diver while underwater suffocating : her air supply was ripped out , leaving her unable to breath for almost half a minute @entity1 appears in the video to find her oxygen in under 30 seconds			1
going to the surface too quickly causes divers to die of a condition called ‘ the bends , ’ which results from oxygen decompressing in the body and forming bubbles in different parts of the body			0
the oxygen bubbles can cause symptoms ranging from joint pain to paralysis and seizures caused by brain damage			0
‘ never in a million years			0
never in a million years did i think that someone would attack like that , especially from such a distance , ’ @entity1 lamented			1
‘ it 's not like we were close up or in their face			0
’ coming for her : the divers saw @entity1 from a distance away and swam at her not near to them : this shot from the beginning of the video shows how far they were from the other divers , there appears to be no provocation she believes the man , and another diver he was with , were reef fisherman skimming the area for fish to take back to land and sell for use in aquariums – which she says damages the ecosystem			1
‘ the greater issue is that @entity7 's reefs are being emptied by these commercial operations , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ @entity7 's reefs are suffering incredibly from this unlimited collection			1
’ reef fishing is legal in @entity7 provided the fisherman has the proper permit and adheres to seasonal , territorial and quantity rules , @entity18 noted			1
it is not clear if the aggressor was breaking any of those rules			0
@entity1 insists she will press charges against her @entity127 have yet to be filed			2

@entity1 claims she was attacked last week by another diver while underwater off the coast of @entity9 , @entity7
she says the only thing that saved her life was her experience in over 10,000 dives
