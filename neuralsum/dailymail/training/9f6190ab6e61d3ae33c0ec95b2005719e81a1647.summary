by @entity0 teachers are said to be uploading information on their pupils up to six times a day onto a council database a huge ' @entity8 ' style database containing details of around eight million schoolchildren is being compiled without the knowledge of their parents			2
it systems specialists are creating the database - including such information as a child 's age , sex , and academic records - which can be shared among officials from other agencies such as the police , @entity23 and charities			1
teachers are uploading information on pupils as often as six times a day to the database , created by @entity30 , one of the @entity33 's largest contractors to both central and local government			2
the database is said to be already being used by as many as 100 local authorities , according to @entity37 , with 22,000 schools nationwide uploading to the service to provide a ' thread ' of data that is accessible to all those working with children			0
it is thought that youth offending teams , which include police officers , will also be offered access to the information			1
as well as basic details such as the child 's address and attendance records , information about special needs and behavioural records are also included			1
the majority of parents are not informed that the data is being gathered and can be held on file indefinitely			2
director of civil liberties and privacy campaign group @entity8 , @entity63 , said : ' parents will be shocked that they are being kept in the dark about how their child 's information is being gathered and exactly what it is used for			1
' although the firm has provided information management systems to schools for many years , teachers could now upload files to the central one database			0
local councils then collate the information and can add information from other authorities to the file			0
although councils upload the information , they do not use the children 's pictures			2
under the @entity84 system information about children held on a council database could potentially be shared with other local authorities such as the @entity23 , police and youth offending services ( file picture ) a separate software program called @entity92 can allow external officials such as social workers to access a child 's information			1
@entity96 already shares the details of more than 48,000 pupils on its database with youth offending teams and @entity101			1
the authority said that the data is held within data protection laws and only provided to those who need to see it			0
but the @entity107 has confirmed that it will investigate whether use of the one system falls within data protection guidelines			0
@entity30 confirmed that local authorities using the system take data protection laws seriously and confirmed that only a few councils were using the software that allows external agencies to view children 's information			1
a spokesman told @entity37 : ' each local authority holds and manages permission and access to its own information held in its @entity84 database			0
' @entity84 is not a centralised database for the whole country			0
' according to the @entity128 there are currently no plans to centralise the information available through the @entity84 scheme .			0

the databases contain information such as the child 's age , sex and academic and behavioural records
@entity30 's one system can potentially share the information to external agencies such as social services and youth offending teams
the majority of parents are *unaware* that the information is being gathered or how it is used
