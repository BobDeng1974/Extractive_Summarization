this is the terrifying moment two carriages on an amusement ride at @entity4 's @entity3 collided while spinning almost 200ft up in the air			1
footage of the heart - stopping moment when the two carriages hit each other was captured by spectators filming the ride at ground level			1
the attraction , called the @entity15 , can be seen spinning in circles as expected , before a gust of wind appears to begin heaving two carriages towards each other			1
after initially joking about how close together some of the carriages were swinging , those filming the incident reacted with shock when they witnessed the collision			1
one said : ' it looks like its going to hit her			2
see that ? it him them			2
' his friend then responds : ' @entity47 it 's hit them			2
they 've stopped the ride			2
' the video was posted on @entity52 by a woman named @entity54 , who offered a stark warning to those visiting the attraction			1
the carriage was seen swinging wildly moments before it collided with people sat in a separate carriage after the close encounter , the ride stopped spinning and the carriages were dropped to the ground she wrote : ' just a warning to any one who goes to @entity3 ( @entity4 ) be aware of this ride			1
' watch and see what happens			0
scariest moment of my life			1
' onlookers said operators of the giant @entity15 ride were making sure every carriage was filled today to avoid a repeat of the collisions which terrified passengers 200ft above the ground			1
passengers who paid £ 5 each to enjoy the ride waited for as long as 20 mins before each of the two - seater carriages had someone sitting in them			1
if there were not enough paying passengers then workers sat in an empty carriage to stop it swinging wildly in the strong winds			2
