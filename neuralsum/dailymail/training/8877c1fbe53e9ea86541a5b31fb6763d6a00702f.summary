this is the amazing moment a heroic hippo saved a gnu from certain death			2
after being bitten by a crocodile , the large antelope is seen being dragged slowly under the water			0
but just in time , a nearby hippo is seen making its way across the water to help the animal in its hour of need			1
the jaw - dropping moment stunned onlookers including @entity36 photographer , @entity35 , 34 , who managed to capture the rare moment on camera			1
captured whilst on safari in @entity20 game reserve in @entity21 , the exhausted antelope later managed to escape to safety			1
@entity35 said : ' it was an incredible moment , the hippo actually tried to push it out of the water and then guarded the gnu to prevent the crocs getting close			1
another hippo notices the struggling animal and makes its way through the water watch out : the hippos group round the struggling gnu as the croc clings on more hippos join and the herd scare away the crocodile as it slips beneath the murky water in its panic the gnu ends up swimming further back into the water , with the crocodile holding on tightly , it is now the hippo begins to intervene the gnu struggling to get to the bank of the river is dragged back by the crocodile , a hippo is also seen strafing both animals ' i have heard of cases where the animals instinct is to protect the other species , i think the hippos parental instincts took over			1
' the hippos are probably the only animal not afraid of the crocs and i would even say the hippo is the only animal the crocodiles are afraid of			2
' i was shooting the scene from our vehicle for more than two hours			0
the hippo is seen in this video nudging the gnu on the to bank of the river one of the biggest hippos protects the gnu as it makes its way back to the shoreline , guarding it from any further attacks thanks bud : back at shore , a hippo eyes the gnu it helped save you 're welcome : one of the biggest hippos is seen guarding the gnu , encouraging it to leave the water ' we saw the gnu escape the water but it stood there for quite a while as i think it was in shock			0
' when we left the animal was still ashore and seemed uninjured but we had to leave as it was getting dark			0
' even our safari guide was stunned by the hippos behaviour , he said he had never seen anything like it before			0
' it was certainly an unforgettable moment , i feel honoured to have seen such a spectacle			0
