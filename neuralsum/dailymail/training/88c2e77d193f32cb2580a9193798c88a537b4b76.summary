@entity0 in the 21st century is synonymous with upheaval and uncertainty , but even by this once proud club ’s recent standards , @entity3 has ratcheted things up to another level			1
the convicted fraudster , as ruthless as he is charismatic , has swept into @entity9 and not so much taken an axe to the mess he inherited but a machine gun — obliterating waste and leaving plenty of collateral damage			0
@entity3 sees himself as the saviour of a club losing £ 1million a month			1
‘ @entity21 , ’ is how others familiar with the @entity20 ’s ways describe him			1
our findings include : hard bargain : @entity3 is n't afraid of pulling out of deals for players if they are n't right for the football club @entity51 and serious business acumen are mangled together when it comes to @entity54			1
in a 90 - minute telephone conversation , the @entity20 only highlights and heightens the contradictions that make up his character			1
he is disarmingly candid and yet deviously secretive ; he can produce quiet charm then explode in anger ; he can reel off numbers like a maths boffin and also swear like a trooper			2
some questions and challenges bounce off him no matter how insistent ; others result in an unstoppable 10 - minute answer			0
and he has expert timing with comic one - liners			0
while there is much speculation about the finances and running of @entity0 , it is @entity3 ’s comments about @entity77 , plucked from obscurity having been sacked as manager of non-league @entity80 , which prove most interesting			1
the squad are believed to be supportive of an amiable man who is implementing a passing style that has seen steady improvement in pre-season form			0
and he 's gone ! @entity0 sold star striker @entity87 to @entity88 at the beginning of the summer but @entity3 , known in @entity20 as a mangiallenatori — a manager eater — after dismissing 36 in 22 years in charge of @entity91 , will not hesitate to act if things are not to his liking			1
@entity3 said : ‘ i had more or less 50 coaches in my existence , they are all the same			1
i used to have a boat , i used to pay the captain of the boat			0
you know what my strategy was ? if he does n’t do what i like to do with my boat , then i can drive my boat on my own			0
‘ i put myself always in a position to be free and to run a company the way i like , because i use my face , my name , my credibility			1
if they do n’t do what i like to do — i do on my own ! ’ it is clear player recruitment is out of @entity77 ’s hands			1
consultant @entity117 , the former @entity119 compliance officer , and sporting director @entity120 assist @entity54 in spotting potential signings			2
it ’s a complicated recruitment structure , and some connected with the club have reservations			1
@entity127 centre back @entity126 , for example , was chased after @entity120 watched him play just once , in a pre-season draw against @entity0			1
then negotiations broke down over money			0
@entity77 , paid between £ 80 - 90,000 compared to the £ 750,000 salary his predecessor @entity132 had earned , wanted a 31 - year - old defender available on a free , but @entity3 refused			1
‘ he has asked me about five or six players , ’ said the @entity20 before unintentionally damning his new manager : ‘ do n’t forget where he came from ; league five			1
‘ talking with managers of @entity143 clubs , @entity140 clubs , is a new thing			1
he ’s like a baby , who is in a toy shop			2
’ thanks for coming ! @entity3 sacked @entity132 shortly after taking over at @entity9 deals on the brink of completion are prone to collapse as @entity54 applies a tough stance with agents and players			1
@entity154 ’s @entity153 looked set to join , but is understood to have then made too many demands of the club ’s straight - talking owner			1
five players have , however , joined from @entity20 and there is some excitement about their potential			1
@entity3 prefers to agree to smaller fees initially before paying in full if moves are a success			2
forward @entity164 cost £ 500,000 for this year , but will cost an additional £ 1.5m to buy next summer			2
player contracts are heavily incentivised			0
but there would appear to be one substantial barrier to any player signing for @entity54 : a birthday on the 17th of the month			0
@entity3 has thought the number unlucky since suffering a car accident in his twenties that came on friday 17th and involved a vehicle with 17 in the registration plate			2
saving money is @entity54 ’s prime focus			2
‘ i did n’t sleep for six months , ’ @entity3 said			1
‘ this club cost £ 125,000 per day — 365 bloody days a year ! every day i find a new surprise			1
we do n’t own even one bloody chair ! ’ his biggest financial saving to date , however , has been in renegotiating with former majority owners @entity184 over how much the @entity20 would ultimately pay for his 75 per cent share			1
under the terms of the contract , @entity3 agreed to buy the club for £ 11m and also service debts of £ 24m , much owed to @entity184 or associates of the @entity193 bank			1
but after studying the accounts , @entity33 can reveal , @entity3 threatened to take legal action against @entity184 before convincing them to restructure the deal			1
in our conversation , he declined to go into exact figures , but did say : ‘ the issue was very strange			0
the numbers , they were not true			0
@entity184 were not able to understand what they were talking about			2
they were not even able to run a fruit shop			0
‘ when i bought the club it was technically bankrupt			2
i met @entity184 and told them , “ we need to stop fighting			2
if not , we go to war with the lawyers			0
respect ? new manager @entity77 does n't seem to have much say when it comes to @entity54 ‘ i do n’t like to see the blood			2
it ’s better if you get what you want without fighting			0
in six months i spent £ 1.5m on lawyers			0
now @entity184 have 25 per cent of a company worth 10 times what it was before			2
’ in a dark and mysterious sideshow , the former @entity0 managing director @entity222 is spending his third month in a @entity225 police cell without interview by investigators , having been arrested on suspicion of embezzlement during his time at @entity184			1
he denies all charges and friends are concerned there is a link between his statements about possessing damaging evidence against @entity184 and his incarceration			2
@entity3 promised to purchase @entity9 as soon as he took over but was swamped by unforeseen payments elsewhere and the wrangle with @entity184			1
the £ 11m sale of @entity87 could be used and he has pledged to pay £ 16m before november			0
@entity3 ’s sale of the club ’s best player has enraged fans , but he has a different view of events			1
he explained : ‘ @entity87 is a beautiful player			0
i did n’t come to @entity0 to sell @entity87			2
but for him i was nothing , a new owner , he ’s got a lot of money from @entity88 , the chance to live in @entity250			0
what can i say ? i love you @entity87 , stay with me ? ‘ he does n’t give a f * * *			0
he did n’t show up to training			0
he did n’t fly with the club to pre-season			0
i was so p * * * * * off that when @entity88 called me i asked them for £ 10m to make them not buy the player			2
they said yes ! bloody hell			0
that 's a long time ago now ! @entity0 were in the @entity261 semi-finals back in 2001 ‘ @entity77 , the first day he heard @entity87 wanted to go he said , “ i do n’t want him in pre- season , sell him ”			1
i told @entity77 , “ did i ask your f * * * * * * advice ? @entity268 shut the f * * * up ”			0
’ @entity270 , chairman of the @entity271 with some 10,000 members , says surveys showed @entity54 is popular among fans for his uncompromising attitude and approach to sorting business			0
he is also a frequent visitor to nearby pubs and will happily chat to locals			0
but @entity126 is concerned that recent attempts to engage in serious dialogue on important issues have been met with silence			0
he said : ‘ if @entity54 does n’t fulfil that november deadline then more and more of the fans will question his credibility			0
’ @entity3 also predicts a battle to get out of the remarkable contract on the club ’s @entity290 training facility , locking @entity0 into total payments of a further £ 9m			1
because of the cost - cutting , only around six staff attend @entity290 daily , including @entity295			0
it has been described as a ‘ ghost town ’ by regulars			2
the chef has been dismissed , and food is driven up from the restaurant at @entity9			0
some players prefer to bring their own supplies to training			0
despite the chaos and uncertainty , morale among the squad is understood to be positive			0
the match at @entity310 on saturday is a daunting task , particularly for those new boys from @entity20			1
he is a man who likes numbers and none more so than the three points on offer in the season ’s opener .			1

@entity3 took over the club from @entity184
the @entity20 sacked @entity132 and brought in @entity323
@entity0 start the @entity140 season against @entity310 on saturday
@entity3 has saved the club £ 10.5m by renegotiating his deal to buy @entity0 from former owners @entity330 , after finding ‘ untrue numbers ’ in the accounts .
new manager @entity323 has *replaced* @entity132 on approximately one tenth of his predecessor ’s salary .
but @entity3 does not trust him to identify new talent and has cast doubt on his position before the season even starts .
new signings are forbidden from staying at the @entity344 in the city centre because the hotel ’s colour scheme is purple , a colour @entity3 believes is bad luck .
