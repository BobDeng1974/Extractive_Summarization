it is one of the most famous lines in cinema history , but the legendary introduction , ' @entity4 ... @entity4 ' , might never have existed			0
an early draft from 1952 of @entity8 's first @entity4 book , @entity9 , reveals the author had originally intended his hero to call himself @entity12 when on undercover operations			1
' @entity8 's first idea was to give @entity4 an assumed name as his cover , ' revealed his niece @entity17 , whose family owns the draft			1
what 's in a name ? author @entity8 ( left ) had originally intended his famous spy hero to call himself @entity12 in the first 007 book @entity9 ' @entity8 typed it up that way when he [ @entity4 ] first met @entity26 , the @entity27 agent , in the casino at the @entity29			1
' in the typed manuscript the @entity27 operative introduces himself to 007 with the words : ' my name 's @entity26			0
' rare : @entity8 's first draft of @entity9 is owned by his niece he replies with the disappointingly long - winded : ' @entity39			1
' but thankfully , @entity8 later crossed out @entity12 and handwrote the catchier ' @entity4 ' above it , to make it simpler for his readers			2
@entity17 said : ' @entity8 must have realised it would cause confusion if he had @entity4 known as @entity4 to friends and the security services in @entity47 , but as @entity12 for his cover name to strangers or people he did n't want to know he was a spy			2
' the ' @entity4 ... @entity4 ' line appeared a decade later in the first @entity4 film , dr no. the hero spy , then played by @entity55 , uses it to introduce himself to one of the women he later seduces			0
this draft extract from the novel was made public for the first time this weekend , to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the publication of @entity9			1
@entity17 believes that the name @entity12 comes from the 19th century @entity66 philosopher , @entity65 , who @entity8 would have studied while at @entity67 and when he went to universities in @entity69 and @entity66			1
' i 've no proof but i do know @entity8 was interested in philosophy , ' she said			2
' he also often chose names from people he knew or had heard of — sometimes an amalgam of more than one person			0
' cinema history : the ' @entity4 ... @entity4 line was first used on the silver screen by @entity55 in dr no @entity26 came from an @entity82 friend called @entity83			0
and @entity4 itself is generally acknowledged to derive from the the @entity82 ornithologist of the same name , who was an expert on @entity88 birds			0
@entity8 who was a keen birdwatcher himself , was known to draw on his own encounters and interests in his work			2
in the draft of @entity9 , he initially called @entity94 's secretary in @entity47 ' miss @entity95 ' or ' @entity97 ' for short			1
the name and character were based on @entity100 , personal assistant to @entity101 , the then director - general of @entity102			0
' but @entity8 again had second thoughts and changed it to @entity105 , ' @entity17 said			1
inspiration : the name is thought to come from @entity65 , who @entity8 studied at @entity67 in another letter released to the public this weekend , @entity8 complains to @entity110 , the publisher of @entity9 , that the suggested cover price is too low			1
he said in october 1952 : ' i am not in favour of reducing the price of the book to 10/6d			0
' hardly a novel is published today under 12/6d , and i think it would be a mistake for your first thriller to seem to be given away			0
' he added : ' moreover it [ the lower price ] would whittle down still further my already meagre financial expectations from the book			0
' @entity8 lost the battle : the price stayed at 10/6d .			2
