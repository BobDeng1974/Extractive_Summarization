bounding into the world weighing as little as 10lb , there are human babies that have been heavier than @entity4 the pygmy hippo calf			1
she was born at @entity7 three weeks ago and has since enjoyed romping around her enclosure with her father @entity9 and mother @entity9 - who is ferociously protective			0
there are fewer than 2,000 of the rare beasts in the wild and when they are born , their mothers keep them concealed in thick vegetation and visit to breastfeed			1
just 2,000 of the beasts are left in the wild with their west @entity29 habitat facing destruction miniscule : the tiny hippo barely measures up to the bottom of the metal gate she is walking through , and weighs as little as some human babies glurgh ! once fully - grown @entity4 will spend much of her life in the water , but for now it looks the heated pool in her enclosure will take some getting used to			1
pygmy hippo mothers are extremely protective of their calves , and in the wild they keep them hidden in thick undergrowth where they visit periodically to nurse them to full growth mum 's the word : the tiny hippo calves are almost completely helpless for the first three weeks of their lives and can only eat vegetation after three months a leaf out of mum 's book : @entity4 weighs between 10lb and 14lb			1
early explorers thought pygmy hippos were sweating blood because glands emit a clear reddish fluid at @entity61 has the luxury of a heated pool , a plentiful supply of food and no predators , but her mother is still keeping a watchful eye			1
@entity70 , assistant curator of mammals at the zoo , said @entity9 is proving ' very maternal ' with her newborn			1
' @entity4 follows @entity9 a lot , ' she added			0
' @entity9 is very protective and does n't let her stay in deep water for too long			0
' @entity76 easily and @entity9 will quite often guide her baby into shallow water or bring her out of the pool			0
' @entity4 is doing brilliantly , she 's putting on weight really well , she is starting to get a bit chunky			1
feeling shy ? @entity70 , assistant curator of mammals at the zoo , said @entity9 is proving ' very maternal ' with her newborn adding : ' @entity4 follows @entity9 a lot ' gone swimming : @entity4 tests the water , right , with her mother			1
once fully grown pygmy hippos can close their ears and eyes underwater , where they spend long periods conservation : @entity7 is one of several zoos across the continent taking part in a captive breeding regime by the @entity96 dwarfed : while @entity4 's mother @entity9 weighs up to 275kg ( 43st ) , that is still only a tenth the weight of the more widespread common hippopotamus pygmy hippos are hard to study as they are secretive , live in dense forest and females usually breed only once every two years			1
they ovulate for two to three days a month , similarly to humans , and call to males and leave pens messy when they are in the mood			0
calves are born after six months and are helpless at first , unable to walk far or eat vegetation for three months			0
pygmies are much smaller than the common hippo , from whom they split off as as separate species several million years ago			2
they have proportionally longer legs , a smaller head , less prominent eyes and ears more towards the side of the head			1
the nose and ears can be closed underwater			0
early explorers thought the animals were sweating blood because glands emit clear reddish fluid to keep their skin moist			0
in captivity pygmies live for about 30 years , breeding for themselves after five			0
' i think people are quite surprised when they see how small she is because mum and dad are quite big			0
' while @entity137 weighs between 4.5kg ( 10lb ) and 6.2kg ( 1st ) now , she will grow in adulthood to be as heavy as 275kg ( 43st )			2
that pales in insignificance to the size of the more widespread common hippo , however , which are the third - heaviest land mammals on earth			2
fully - grown adults reach between one and a half tonnes ( 236st ) and three tonnes ( 472st )			2
@entity7 is part of an international breeding programme for the tiny hippos , which also includes zoos such as @entity150 and @entity151 , as fewer than 2,000 of them are thought to exist naturally in the wild			1
it is impossible to know how many are still alive because their habitats in @entity156 , which includes @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 , have been blighted by unrest and big business			2
deforestation of the area around the @entity165 in @entity157 , carried out by logging companies , is threatening one of the pygmy hippo 's last known strongholds			0
scientists have been using camera traps - live video feeds disguised in rocks , vegetation or trees - to monitor the patterns of how the naturally reclusive animals move through the dense forest			0
the captive breeding regime is taking place under the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) , with participating zoos across the continent			0
@entity183 and @entity9 will have completed a long wait for a baby - as they are the only pygmy hippos currently living at the zoo , and females only breed in the wild once every two years			1
ms @entity70 said : ' the @entity191 programme is a well - established and very successful programme and our male , @entity183 , is a genetically important animal ; by default , so will be his offspring			1
' ' mum ... i think someone 's here to see us ' : visitors will soon be able to flock to the pygmy hippo exhibit to see @entity4 enjoying her heated bathing pool too cute for words : female pygmy hippos breed only every two or so years , though they are similar to humans - they become fertile for two or three days every month and pregnancies last for six months			2
like humans and unlike other @entity29 wildlife such as buck , pygmy hippo calves are more or less helpless for the first stages of their life			0

fewer than 2,000 of the tiny hippos survive in the wild after deforestation and war in their native @entity156
the girl calf weighs as little as 10lb - while adult common hippos can reach three tonnes
the rare breed has proportionally longer legs , smaller eyes and a smaller head than its *mainstream* *cousins*
