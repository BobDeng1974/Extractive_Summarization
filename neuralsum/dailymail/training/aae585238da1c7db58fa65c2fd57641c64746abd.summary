by @entity0 a @entity2 tourist resort is trying out the idea of using dogs as lifeguards - and the idea is working so well it could catch on elsewhere			1
the experiment in the coastal town of @entity9 , in the southern province of @entity11 , began when a human lifeguard started taking his pet @entity14 out to sea with him , and found he was not only an incredibly strong swimmer , he was also able to pull a very large weight			1
since then ' @entity18 ' has been employed full time as a lifeguard , assisting his owner @entity20 on rescues and convincing the local coastguard to recruit more dogs to help patrol the area			1
on patrol : @entity18 's webbed feet and ultra-buoyant coat make him a natural swimmer			2
he also boasts an ability to swim up to three miles without tiring and can drag a load of up to one and a half tonnes when mr @entity20 first purchased @entity18 as a two - month - old puppy weighing only 15lbs , he did n't expect him to be anything more than a much - loved pet			1
but after taking him to the beach one day and allowing him to swim in the water , the lifeguard realised that his rapidly - growing canine friend might just have the potential to become a colleague			0
' i just wanted a dog as a pet and had not really thought about working with him in my job as a lifeguard , but after i had him two weeks i took him with me to the sea and realised what a fantastic swimmer he was , ' mr @entity20 said			0
@entity18 's thick double layer of fur and webbed feet make him a natural swimmer , adding to his buoyancy and allowing him to cut through the water with ease			2
and in the searing heat of the @entity2 summer , there is nothing black - furred @entity18 loves more than to cool off with a dip in the sea			0
hit : @entity18 regularly accompanies @entity20 ( yellow t - shirt ) on rescue missions in @entity9			1
he has proved such a success that officials are now considering hiring more @entity14 lifeguards although @entity18 is making front - page news in @entity2 , he is actually following a long tradition of @entity14 dogs being used for water rescue work			1
in 1995 a 10 - month - old @entity14 named @entity72 saved a hearing - impaired man from drowning in the @entity74 in @entity75			0
@entity72 noticed the struggling man while he and his owner were walking by the river			0
he instinctively jumped into the water , dragging the drowning man to shore by holding on to his arm			0
according to @entity82 , the @entity14 's breeder , @entity72 had received no formal training in water rescue and simply showed a natural ability for both swimming and saving lives			2
it 's not just his talent for swimming that makes @entity18 an ideal lifeguard			2
his incredible strength and stamina means he can easily swim three miles before getting tired and needing a rest			1
mr @entity20 has also given @entity18 a few strength tests and was shocked to discover he could quite happily drag water - filled plastic containers weighing up to one and half tonnes back to shore			1
with him showing all the assets of a natural lifeguard , it was n't long before @entity18 started accompanying mr @entity20 on rescues - testing whether he could do in a life - or - death situation what he was easily capable of while fooling around with his owner			1
the results were unsurprisingly positive , with @entity18 easily capable of dragging a drowning - and often panicking - person back to the shore with the minimum of fuss			0
' if i rush out to rescue someone and there is a second person with them , then @entity18 can carry one of them and pull them to shore			0
or if i get tired , he can pull us both or we take turns at pulling the other person , ' mr @entity20 said			0
' i was n't sure if my employers go for it but after trials they really love the idea , and now i think they are planning to get other lifeguard dogs , ' he added			0
@entity18 may be the first lifeguard rescue dog ever to be used in @entity9 , but it now looks as if he is unlikely to be the last .			2

@entity18 the @entity14 has incredible strength and swimming ability
owner @entity20 noticed dog 's natural *skills* during visit to the beach
now he regularly helps the lifeguard on rescues in @entity9
@entity18 's incredible stamina means he can swim three miles without tiring
can also pull plastic containers weighing one and a half tonnes to shore
officials in @entity2 resort now plan to hire more @entity14 lifeguards
