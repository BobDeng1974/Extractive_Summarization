the battle over the @entity10 bill has seen leading web firms square off against @entity13 media companies in a trade - off between internet freedom and intellectual property rights			1
now it could burst into the open as technology giants are planning to ' censoring ' their own homepages , according to a leading internet lobby group			0
blackout ? sites including @entity24 are planning drastic action to protest against the @entity10 sites such as @entity24 , @entity27 and @entity28 could temporarily replace their usual homepage with a black screen and a message asking users to contact politicians and urge them to oppose the @entity10			1

opposition : @entity50 , founder of @entity51 , is one of many tech pioneers hoping to defeat @entity10 @entity53 , the world 's largest domain registration company , had been a rare example of a web firm which supported @entity10 , but was today forced to reverse its position after thousands of users deserted it over its political stance			1
a boycott campaign which involved giants such as @entity51 as well as a network of individual users and small companies led to @entity53 announcing today that was no longer in favour of the bill			1
the firm 's chief executive @entity69 said in a statement : ' @entity53 opposes @entity10 because the legislation has not fulfilled its basic requirement to build a consensus among stake - holders in the technology and internet communities			1
' the unorthodox campaigning methods used by opponents of @entity10 are a response to their being heavily outspent by @entity13 firms			1
author : representative @entity83 ( @entity84 ) , sponsor of the bill media companies are spending ten times as much as technology firms on lobbying in relation to @entity10 , which they hope will crack down on copyright theft around the world by allowing the government to remove links to piracy websites from search engines and social networks			1
