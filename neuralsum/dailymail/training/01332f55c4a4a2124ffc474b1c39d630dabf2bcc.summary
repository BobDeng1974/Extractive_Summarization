most women who socialise in pubs or clubs will have experienced some kind of unwanted attention on a night out whether it 's heavy breathing down their neck at the bar , a grope on the dance floor , crass comments , bum pinching or aggressive ' banter '			1
sadly , being hassled on a night out is now seen as the norm and as such often goes unchallenged and unreported			0
but one @entity15 council is taking a stand against harassment by working with local pubs , clubs , bars and restaurants to introduce a women 's safety charter			1
@entity24 council have introduced a women 's @entity22 in a bid to help women feel secure on a night out and stamp out harassment in the area @entity24 council is asking local businesses to sign up to a set of commitments designed to give women the confidence to report incidents to venue managers			1
the borough in south east @entity15 is home to almost 500 licensed venues and wants to send a clear message to customers that any level of harassment will not be tolerated			1
thirty venues , including the famous @entity46 nightclub and @entity47 and @entity49 ’s @entity48 , had already signed up when the charter was launched on tuesday			1
they say : ' @entity52 takes this type of harassment seriously and believes it is an issue that reduces women ’s quality of life			1
' so , we carried out a large scale consultation with the public , council and partner officers , elected members and licensees to hear about their experiences and understand what can be done keep women safe from harassment on a night out			1

' championing the campaign is councillor @entity84 , the country 's first deputy cabinet member for women 's safety			1
she said : ' typically , harassment is seen as " normal " and goes without being reported or even spoken about			0
as a council we believe it is time this trend was reversed and that women are made to feel confident enough to speak out against incidents that make them feel uncomfortable , intimidated or threatened			2
' everyone deserves to enjoy a night out without the fear of harassment or intimidation			0
we want to show harassment to women and girls is n’t acceptable			2
' the charter was created after speaking to female @entity24 residents , and @entity84 told @entity109 : ' there ’s a kind of ubiquity of harassment and groping that happens in clubs			0
we need to help women get home safely			0
women in nightclubs still feel men are quite predatory			0
' i think harassment of women is all about the idea that women are occupying men ’s spaces			2
they ’re either not welcome or need to be controlled in some way			0
that kind of feeling underpins how women feel in public spaces and nightclubs			0
