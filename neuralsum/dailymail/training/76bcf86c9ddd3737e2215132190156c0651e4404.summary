by @entity0 foreign chefs , bricklayers and tilers will no longer require a sponsor to work in @entity6 come july in a bid by the @entity8 to fill labour and skills shortages			1
the three professions have been added to the @entity12 which means workers do not have to be sponsored by employers for a permanent visa			1
but the move has been slammed by unions who say the government should be looking out for domestic workers instead of encouraging more overseas workers to come to @entity6			1
foreign chefs will no longer have to be sponsored to come work in @entity6 from july 1 the changes were made following advice from the @entity25 and @entity26 based on labour market , education and training , migration and general economic and demographic data , and stakeholder submissions			1
assistant minister for immigration and border protection @entity34 said @entity6 residents would always come first			1
' the @entity39 believes that where there is an @entity6 who is ready , willing and able to do the job , they should always be considered first , ' she said			1
' however , it would be simplistic to say that there is always an @entity6 willing and available to fill a particular position in various geographical locations within @entity6 , and it is the role of the skilled migration program to fill the gap where such shortages exist			1
' it is important to remember that a business that is forced to close due to an inability to source vital skilled labour is a business that employs no - one			2
' a @entity57 spokesman said figures indicated chefs have been in shortage for the past 10 years , which threatens the sustainability of the hospitality and tourism industry			0
he also said the vacancy rate for the sector was more than four times the national average , according to industry experts			0
the union who represents chefs is @entity71 and its acting national secretary @entity72 said he was ' very concerned ' about the move			2
' we do n’t think labour issues within the industry need for this to occur , ' he said			2
' the hospitality industry is very good at and easily able to attract staff through the industry			0
' mr @entity72 said instead of going overseas for jobs the government should be investing in training and furthering career paths			0
' in the era of @entity87 are you telling me there are n’t people who do n’t want to become chefs ? it just does n’t make sense , ' he said			0
tilers and bricklayers have also been added to the @entity12 that currently has 188 jobs on it bricklayers and tilers have also been included on the list because of a predicted increase in demand coupled with a fall in apprenticeship completions			1
based on 2012 projections by the @entity106 , there will be a 13.4 per cent increase in the number of people employed as bricklayers over five years to november 2017 and a 17.3 per cent increase in the number of people employed as tilers occupation over the same period of time			0
@entity34 , the assistant minister for immigration , hopes it will help address the skills shortage in these industries but @entity120 's @entity119 said the @entity39 's reasoning for adding the three occupations to the list were unfounded			1
' in particular the building trades that the government intend to put back on the list are trades where there are no shortages and even the @entity130 have acknowledged that , ' he said			2
' it seems that the @entity133 again is putting the @entity6 workers ' interest last			1
' rather than ramping up migration in these areas they should be addressing the collapse in apprentice numbers in these trades			0
' it ’s extraordinary the government would do this would do this based on the evidence and to the people who pay their wages			0
' the number of skilled workers to be taken in under the program has been capped at 43,990			0
to ensure these industries are not dominated by overseas workers , a ceiling cap of six per cent of the workforce is enforced for all industries , but the chef workforce will be dropped to three per cent for six months from july 1 and will then be reviewed			0
the department 's spokesman said it would increase if no ' adverse behaviour ' was identified			0
currently there are 188 jobs on the @entity12 - including accountants , social workers , psychotherapists , fitter and turners , stonemasons and teachers			2
@entity119 of the @entity120 says the government was not looking after @entity6 workers by introducing the move			2

the three professions have been added to the @entity12
it means they can come to @entity6 without an employer 's sponsorship
the @entity8 says it will address labour and skills shortages
but construction union says no evidence that there is a employee shortfall
