by @entity0 published : 19:31 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 03:26 est , 19 march 2013 together for 21 years : @entity2 front man @entity1 and @entity3 are at war over the £ 10m mansion they once shared @entity3 was once again on top form at a press conference last week , tossing out snappy quotes and posing in a leopard - print skirt and size eight @entity13 heels			1
her wide , red smile , painted on for the cameras , never faltered as she plugged her forthcoming theatrical run in @entity18 as mrs @entity19 in @entity20			0
but , 10,000 miles away from that sunny @entity23 photocall , storm clouds are gathering as she faces up to what , at 56 , might be a rather tricky third act in her life			0
all but one of her four children have flown the nest and her two - year romance with billionaire property tycoon @entity32 has run its course ( they split up last september )			0
meanwhile , her beloved mother , @entity36 , a strong - willed @entity37 matriarch , died following a stroke and heart failure earlier this year at the age of 88			0
like many divorcees of a certain age and with an uncertain income , @entity3 is looking to the future with nervous eyes			1
but what , you may ask , has she got to be nervous about ? was n’t she once married to @entity1 , one of the most successful and wealthy men in showbusiness ? surely , a lonely retirement spent in penury is the last thing she needs to fear			1
in the midst of these major changes in her life , friends say @entity3 is turning her attention to her retirement and the eventual fate of her £ 10 million home in @entity65 , south - west @entity66			1
in fact , she is thinking of selling the 26 - room property in order to release funds , a course of action which seems to be putting her on a collision course with her fabulously wealthy ex. for elegant @entity75 is the place where she and @entity1 raised their family , @entity79 , 28 , @entity80 , 27 , @entity81 , 20 , and @entity82 , 15			1
the eldest two @entity1 children live in the @entity84 , model @entity81 rents a house with friends in @entity66 and @entity82 still lives at home with his mother			1
@entity1 and @entity3 bought the house , which dates from 1780 , in 1991 for £ 2.25 million			1
when they moved in , @entity3 was pregnant with @entity81 , and @entity1 was in the throes of a stormy dalliance with model @entity93 , who is now mrs @entity95			1
@entity75 was the @entity97 ’ home for seven years until one night , in november 1998 , when , during a dinner party , @entity3 was handed a copy of a newspaper alleging that the @entity102 model , @entity101 , was pregnant by @entity1			1
after the baby , @entity103 , was born , @entity1 moved out			2
battle ground : @entity75 , the £ 10m property in @entity65 , south west @entity66 that @entity3 wants @entity1 to sign over to her in the legal wrangles which followed , it was widely believed that @entity1 had signed over the house to @entity3			1
everyone assumed that @entity1 — who is worth around £ 200 million and counting — had wanted at least to give her the family home after cheating on her			2
but the fate of the property was n’t quite that straightforward			0
@entity3 had to suffer the humiliation of having her marriage annulled in 1999 after it was revealed that the ceremony she and @entity1 underwent in @entity120 in 1990 had no legal validity			1
sources said @entity3 had been hoping for a ‘ divorce ’ settlement in the order of £ 30 million , but i can reveal that she walked away with around a third of that			1
and not one of @entity1 ’s many properties dotted around the globe			2
@entity1 permitted her to stay on in the house in @entity65 , but it remained a mutual asset			2
now @entity3 is asking the man who shared her bed for 21 years to sign it over to her			1
she has asked him for ‘ clarity ’ when it comes to the house and his intentions for it			0
cha cha ching : @entity3 's stint on @entity147 last year is thought to have earned her £ 55,000 , and she wrote a tell - all autobiography for @entity150 in 2009 , for which she received a £ 500,000 advance a friend of @entity3 ’s says : ‘ it is a source of increasing concern to her as she gets older			1
’ apparently , she would like to be able to sell the house or leave it to her children , but she ca n’t while @entity1 ’s name is still on the deeds			2
a source told me last week : ‘ i know that she has been thinking about it			0
her mum has just died and all of that stirs up where you want to be			0
it could simply be an exercise in finding out what her possibilities are			0
that said , she will want to sell up when she gets older			0
at the moment , it ’s just her and @entity82 there , and it ’s a big house for two people			0
the upkeep is very expensive , too			0
when the roof goes , it costs thousands			0
’ sources close to @entity1 , however , think it highly unlikely @entity3 will get her way over this piece of prime real estate			1
@entity1 ’s spokesman refused to comment , saying : ‘ this is confidential			2
’ sources close to the initial separation deal say his lawyers at @entity189 put a complex series of conditions around @entity3 continuing to stay there			1
they say @entity1 gave her the house to live in only until she was 65			2
conditions also stipulated that , should she remarry or cohabit , she would have to leave @entity75			2
another provision stated that if @entity1 died before @entity3 , his heirs could enforce the conditions			1
@entity3 , of course , agreed to all this			2
she will have been advised by her legal team at @entity203 that , as an unmarried partner , she had no rights in law			0
@entity1 ’s view was always that she was the one who wanted a permanent split , and that he was just acting on legal advice to protect what was his			2
it is fair to say , though , that bricks and mortar exerted some pull over @entity1 : within a few months of their split , it emerged that @entity1 was refusing to leave @entity75			1
while both of them had moved on emotionally — @entity3 dallied with @entity220 of @entity221 and novelist @entity222 , @entity1 with heiress @entity223 and model @entity224 — they maintained a semblance of family life			1
@entity1 bought a flat next door and an entrance was knocked through between the two properties			2
here 's to you : @entity1 got into the habit of coming and going as he pleased , and looked after the children on the nights in 2000 when @entity3 was playing mrs @entity19 opposite @entity236 in @entity20 @entity1 got into the habit of coming and going as he pleased , and looked after the children on the nights in 2000 when @entity3 was playing mrs @entity19 in @entity66 ’s @entity238			1
perhaps unsurprisingly , this compromise eventually became intolerable			0
by 2002 , when @entity3 was involved with banker @entity240 and @entity1 was dating stylist @entity241 , @entity3 asked him to move on			1
@entity240 was reportedly unsettled by the idea of @entity1 watching him come and go			2
@entity1 moved into a suite at @entity244 in @entity245 which cost him £ 2,500 a night			2
that should have been that			0
but , rather awkwardly , @entity1 ’s girlfriend @entity241 was pictured sneaking out of the @entity65 house on the eve of a @entity2 concert at nearby @entity252 in 2003			2
@entity3 was in @entity253 playing mrs @entity19 at the time , and was reportedly furious			2
fashionable romance : @entity1 is now with fashion designer @entity241 a source close to @entity1 said : ‘ @entity3 does n’t want him parading his new girlfriend in front of their kids and he was happy to respect her wishes			1
‘ but his hotel bill was mounting up and he took his chance to move back in while @entity3 was away in the @entity84 he is going to have a lot of explaining to do now they have been caught			0
’ this was swiftly followed the next year by a row over antiques and paintings at @entity75			0
@entity1 let @entity3 know that the furnishings , ornaments and paintings in @entity65 were his and said that he wanted them back			1
among them were @entity275 and @entity277 originals and several @entity278 , said to be worth up to £ 30 million			0
the valuables were placed in storage , at a cost of more than £ 400,000 a year , and were later moved into @entity1 ’s new property , a house in @entity284 , @entity66 , which he bought in 2006			1
by then , relations between him and @entity3 were at an all - time low , not helped by @entity3 ’s failed romance with explorer @entity287 , and @entity1 ’s continued happiness with @entity241 , who is still his girlfriend			1
the following year , it became clear that @entity75 needed a great deal of maintenance work			0
@entity1 and @entity3 agreed to split the £ 100,000 bill , but were ‘ barely on speaking terms ’ over it			1
since then , however , relations have improved			0
@entity3 said last year : ‘ @entity1 ’s funny , brilliantly talented and quite easy to live with — except for the infidelity			1
‘ we ’re very good friends now			0
’ @entity3 has continued to work on stage , tv and modelling endorsements			0
her stint on @entity147 last year is thought to have earned her £ 55,000 , and she wrote a tell - all autobiography for @entity150 in 2009 , for which she received a £ 500,000 advance			0
but the book was never published after @entity3 failed to dish enough dirt			0
rather than elaborate on @entity1 ’s shortcomings , she chose to return her advance			0
she did , though , say the project was not necessarily permanently shelved			0
‘ i ’m not ready to put it out yet			0
maybe in a few years , ’ she said			0
was this a coded warning to @entity1 ? perhaps if the battle for @entity75 hots up , we may finally get to read her unvarnished account of what life with the @entity322 was like .			1
