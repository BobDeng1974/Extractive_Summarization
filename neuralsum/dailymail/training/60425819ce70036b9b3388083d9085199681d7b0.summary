by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:59 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 21:00 est , 23 february 2013 aviation authorities are investigating a serious incident at @entity4 in which a @entity6 plane taxied the wrong way down a runway on which other planes were about to land			1
@entity6 flight @entity11 , from ­ @entity13 to @entity4 , missed its exit and made a 180 - degree turn at the end of the runway , before heading back the way it had come – causing other flights to abort or delay landings , the @entity22 can reveal			1
dramatic recordings of @entity25 communications , which have been heard by the @entity26 , describe how the @entity6 flight had to ‘ brake hard ’			1
other planes were ordered ‘ go around ’			2
incident : a @entity6 plane caused huge disruption at @entity4 airport after it missed its exit and taxied the wrong way down a runway other flights were about to land on the @entity37 is investigating the incident , in which @entity11 attempted another unauthorised turn before being directed onto another exit			1
after the incident , another @entity6 plane , @entity42 , addressed as @entity44 , asks the tower : ‘ what was wrong with the runway ? ’ the control tower replies : ‘ well what happened was one of your company aircraft landed on runway 28 , appeared to be going to the very end of the runway and just before they got to @entity59 7 [ a runway exit ] , they made a 180 degree turn which , eh , just screwed every ­ thing			1
’ a statement from the @entity37 revealed that the incident was being treated seriously			0
‘ the @entity37 is investigating an incident at @entity4 on february 15 where an aircraft that landed and was cleared to vacate the runway , completed a 180 degree turn back down the runway , ’ said a spokesman			1
‘ there were other aircraft on approach to land on this runway , which were being monitored by air traffic control and as the other aircraft was still on the runway these aircraft were instructed to perform a missed approach			1
’ the authority said that an investigation was an ‘ entirely normal procedure ’ in such circumstances ‘ to avoid any safety issues arising for passengers or aircraft ’			0
the @entity37 is now investigating the incident at @entity4 , pictured , on february 15 the statement continues : ‘ prior to any further landings , an inspection of the runway was conducted by the airport authority to ensure the runway was available for use			1
this again is a normal procedure			0
shortly thereafter , the runway was reopened and operations resumed			2
’ @entity6 confirmed that it was aware of the incident			1
a spokesman said : ‘ this incident was reported by @entity6 to the @entity37 and we are co-operating fully with their enquiries			1
we have nothing further to add to the @entity37 statement			0
’ on the recordings , the control tower is heard instructing an @entity106 flight from @entity107 : ‘ 529 , you ’re going to have to go around too			2
the runway has to be inspected and if you can maintain present heading please and maintain 2,000ft			0
’ in the incident , @entity110 had been cleared to land on @entity112			0
after landing , air traffic control called the crew and requested they ‘ expedite vacating the runway ’ which the crew acknowledged			0
almost immediately , the incredulous ­ - sounding controller asked the crew : ‘ 227 , have you made a 180 ? ’			0
the response from the crew was : ‘ affirm			0
’ the controller immediately alerted the next incoming aircraft , @entity106 flight @entity125 from @entity126 , telling it : ‘ go around			0
’ serious incident : an @entity106 plane was forced to abort its landing when it was less than a minute from touchdown and fly around @entity4 airport to come in from another approach the @entity106 plane – about to land on runway 28 , where @entity110 was now taxiing the wrong way – aborted its landing and flew around the airport to come in for another approach			1
while @entity106 flight @entity139 had not been cleared to land , the flight was less than a minute from touchdown when the crew was forced to abort			2
the controller also advised the crew of the next inbound flight , @entity148 from @entity149 : ‘ possible go - around now , traffic has made a 180 on the runway			2
’ @entity6 227 then called the tower to advise it they were turning off at taxiway @entity151			2
the tower controller told the pilot : ‘ no , you ca n’t make that turn			0
you ’ve got to all the way down the runway to @entity159			0
this meant that the @entity6 jet had to travel almost halfway back down the 2.6km runway			1
no other aircraft could land or take off until the aircraft had cleared the runway			0
soon afterwards , the controller confirmed to flight @entity148 that it too would have to abort its landing and go around			0
the tower next made several attempts at finding out from @entity6 227 exactly why it had made the unauthorised 180 - degree turn rather than continue to the end of the runway and exit at @entity176			1
statement : a @entity6 spokesman confirmed the company was aware of the incident and is co-operating with the investigation the crew explained they ’d had issues with the landing and had had to brake hard			2
an airport rescue vehicle carried out an inspection for rubber or debris left on the runway after the hard braking and to see whether any runway lights had been broken			0
several other incoming @entity6 and @entity106 flights were told to break off their approaches and enter holding patterns over the @entity197 for several minutes until this had been completed			2
the runway was quickly inspected and cleared to allow landings to recommence			2
while the runway was effectively closed for less than 15 minutes , a total of eight flights were @entity204 ’s likely that the incident cost both @entity6 and @entity106 thousands of euro in extra fuel			1
hundreds of passengers were delayed			0
@entity6 came under fire late last year after three of its planes made emergency landings in @entity213 , @entity214 , in just one day			1
the criticism prompted outspoken boss @entity216 to defend the budget airline , claiming its safety record over its 28 - year history was ‘ impeccable ’			0
an air traffic controller told a pilot that a @entity6 plane had ' just screwed everything ' by making a u-turn ( stock image )			1

@entity6 flight @entity11 , from ­ @entity13 to @entity4 , missed runway exit
plane then turned at the end of the runway and went back the way it came
@entity236 was then forced to *divert* other planes and delay landings
