by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 7 october 2012 updated : 02:07 est , 8 october 2012 the @entity3 's first live show of the series was 1.7 million viewers down on last year - while @entity6 was more than a million up , overnight figures show			1
the ongoing ratings woes will be an unwanted present for @entity3 boss @entity9 who celebrates his 53rd birthday today			0
although @entity3 proved a bigger draw than arch rival @entity6 , its 9.2 million average audience was down markedly on the first show of the live stages in 2011 which pulled in 10.9 million			1
the @entity17 : make - overs and troubled tales was enough to stop @entity3 from losing to @entity6 and @entity6 , which screened its first live saturday night show last night , enjoyed an audience of 8.7 million , compared to 7.5 million who tuned in for the equivalent show last year			1
x factor bosses will be comforted that the show was still the most watched show on @entity28 tv last night			0
but its share of viewers was well down on 2011 , accounting for an average 40 % of the available audience last night , while last year it dragged in 49 %			0
and its peak audience was well down too , with 12.7 million for the first live show last year , but 10.3 million last night			2
@entity36 : judges @entity37 and @entity38 did pull in more of an audience than @entity6 , but it was still down on last year 's average chemistry : she fitted in well with the other judges , @entity45 , @entity46 , and even @entity47 , who was being mean to the dancers last year @entity49 started out on top but @entity6 began to race ahead as the competition went on , although the @entity53 show had won out again by the final stages			1
last night @entity3 viewers saw @entity56 given a second chance as he returned to the show as the wildcard entry , spared by viewers ' votes			2
drama : wildcard @entity56 collapsed when he found out he got through and @entity64 's stunning performance all possibly contributed to the ratings win and in @entity6 , @entity66 became a surprise star with the highest score of the night for her dancefloor debut , with notoriously difficult - to - please judge @entity47 declaring simply you can dance , after she showed off her cha cha cha .			0

@entity3 beat @entity6 with 9.2 million viewers , compared to 8.7 million
but first live show was down 1.7 million on last year 's ratings
*strictly* pulled in *1.2* million more viewers than last year but still not enough to beat @entity3
tv *pundits* warn @entity3 always starts with *initial* ratings *advantage*
