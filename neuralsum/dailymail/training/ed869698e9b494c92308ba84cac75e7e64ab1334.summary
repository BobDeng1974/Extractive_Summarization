laws safeguarding journalists ’ sources must be strengthened to prevent ‘ snooping ’ by the police , @entity0 said yesterday			1
he said he was ‘ concerned ’ by recent cases in which detectives used powers to spy on reporters and obtain details of their sources ‘ without clear justification ’			1
the deputy prime minister called for journalists to be given a wider public interest defence if charged with breaking the law in pursuit of a story , saying it was ‘ incredibly important in a free society ’			2
protection : laws protecting journalists ’ sources must be strengthened to prevent ‘ snooping ’ , @entity0 said revelations that police used the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) to access details of reporters ’ phone conversations sparked calls for reform			1
speaking at a press conference in @entity31 yesterday , mr @entity0 said the law should be changed to require the use of @entity24 powers to reveal journalists ’ sources to be signed off by a judge			1
asked about recent cases , mr @entity0 replied : ‘ i am concerned about this			1
it is incredibly important in a free society that journalists should be able to go after information where there ’s a clear public interest to do so without fear that they will be snooped upon or have their files rifled through without clear justification			2
’ he went on : ‘ where the police ask you ( a journalist ) for information which might reveal your sources – privileged information – that should n’t be done on the say so of a police officer , even a senior police officer			0
that should only be done on the say so of a judge			0
' it is a big thing to say to the @entity61 in this country : “ we can demand to know where you got your information from and we don ’ t even need to go to a judge to do so			0
” that needs to change			0
’ police used the powers against the @entity71 as part of its inquiry into @entity74 ( above ) mr @entity0 also signalled unease over the large number of current prosecutions against journalists			1
existing laws provide reporters with only a limited defence that the story they were pursuing was in the public interest			0
mr @entity0 said this defence should now be enshrined in law , with amendments made to a number of major pieces of legislation to make it clear that there are circumstances where journalists can legitimately break the law in pursuit of a story			1
‘ there should be a public interest defence put in law - you would probably need to put it in the @entity101 , the @entity102 , maybe one or two other laws as well - where you enshrine a public interest defence for the press so that where you are going after information and you are being challenged , you can set out a public interest defence to do so , ’ he said			0
mr @entity0 also called yesterday for jail terms for anyone found guilty of large - scale data theft			2
‘ the penalties that exist at the moment are pathetic - a small rap over the knuckles and a £ 100 fine			0
there should be a custodial sentence attached to major data theft			0
’ recent concern has focused on four cases in which it emerged that police forces used @entity24 to spy on journalists			2
in three cases , the powers were used to seize phone records , despite the journalists involved not being suspected of breaking the law			1
in one case involving the @entity71 , the phone records of two journalists were seized as part of an inquiry into allegations that @entity74 , a former judge , had misled the police			1
home secretary @entity135 has promised to publish a revised code ‘ to make clear that specific consideration must be given to communications data requests involving those in sensitive professions , such as journalists ’			0
but @entity141 , assistant commissioner at the @entity142 , has defended the practice , saying ‘ nobody should be above the law ’			0
speaking mast week , mr @entity141 said : ‘ we will keep using the powers to chase down criminals whether they are ordinary members of the public or journalists			2

mr @entity0 *voiced* concern over powers used to expose confidential sources
he said recent examples show *incidents* do not have a ' clear justification '
police can seize phone records without *approval* by a court of law
that is despite journalists having legal protection for freedom of speech
