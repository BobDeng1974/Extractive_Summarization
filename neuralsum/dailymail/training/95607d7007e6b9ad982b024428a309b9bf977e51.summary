despite prosecutors failing to present any physical evidence , he was forced to spend 18 years behind bars and was scheduled for a lethal injection twice before eventually being freed in 2010			1
for 12 of his years in prison , @entity9 was held in solidarity confinement , which saw him spend at least 22 hours a day locked alone in a tiny concrete cell with a metal bed and a toilet			1
above , this photo is believed to show @entity9 ' cell now , the free man , who was released after the key witness in the trial recanted his testimony and a judge ruled the prosecutor had withheld evidence , is seeking what he deems ' life - saving ' reform			1
speaking to take @entity44 , @entity9 , who was also jailed after the prosecutor intimidated witnesses , said long - term isolation can lead to psychological damage that lasts even when an inmate is freed			1
' solitary confinement is designed to break a man 's will to live , ' he said			1
' you 're sitting there , in a little cage , day in and day out , year in and year out , waiting for the state to execute you or release you			2
' while he was on @entity8 's death row , @entity9 said he ' witnessed men just literally , literally losing their minds '			1
some of them resorted to slitting their own throats to escape from the torment , he said			0
those who were released went into the outside word ' with a lot of baggage ' , including ptsd and hypersensitivity , he said , adding that he himself would often burst into tears for no reason			0
' the first three years i was out â€¦ i could n't even hold a conversation with people without crying , ' he said			2
@entity9 also suffered from difficulty sleeping , but his condition eventually improved , he said			2
cal for action : now , the free man ( pictured , left , speaking to @entity80 of @entity8 in 2013 and , right , in his mug shot after being arrested on suspicion of killing six people in 1992 ) is seeking what he deems ' life - saving ' reform release : ' solitary confinement is designed to break a man 's will to live , ' said @entity9 ( pictured speaking to reporters after his release from prison in 2010 )			1
he said it had psychologically affected him after his release more than 6,500 inmates in @entity8 are currently living in solitary confinement , according to a report by the @entity80 of @entity8 and the @entity96 , which was published last week			1
however , this figure does not include prisoners who are on death row			2
inmates typically remain in solitary confinement in the state for nearly four years before being transferred or released			2
but more than 100 prisoners have been in solitary for more than 20 years , the report says			2
the inmates are forced to live in conditions that ' impose such severe deprivations ' that they are left psychologically damaged and more likely to commit crimes again upon release , it claims			0
' we met with people who were profoundly mentally ill. so mentally ill we did n't feel comfortable sharing their stories in this report , ' attorney @entity112 , who helped produce the report , said			0
death row : over 6,500 inmates in @entity8 are currently living in solitary confinement , according to a report by the @entity80 of @entity8 and the @entity96			1
above , @entity8 's death row , where @entity9 was held dire conditions : prisoners in solitary confinement are often forced to use their beds and toilets as tables for meals , can not put up posters and will either have no window or a tiny strip of glass to see out of ( pictured ) @entity112 said that prisoners in solitary confinement are often forced to use their beds and toilets as tables for meals , can not put up posters and will either have no window or a tiny strip of glass			1
he added that these dire conditions mean that correctional officers have little control over inmates - because there are no longer privileges that can be removed for bad behavior			0
' when someone 's in solitary , they have nothing to lose			0
their lives are miserable , ' he said			0
according to the report , the @entity151 holds more than 4 percent of its prisoners in solitary confinement - around four times more than the national average			2
in recent years , other states have started to limit the practice of placing prisoners in solitary confinement amid concerns it can result in damage their mental health in the long run			1
last month , @entity166 's @entity165 , the second biggest prison in @entity167 , banned such confinement for inmates under the age of 21 , take part reported			0
speaking to @entity80 in 2012 , @entity9 said : ' solitary confinement is driving men crazy			1
i do n't understand how someone can subject another human being to this type of punishment and think that it 's justified			0
' it is totally inhumane			0
there 's no way around it			0
you know , you really do n't truly understand the impact of removing someone from human contact for years			0
it has a negative effect on that person			0
' i experienced that so many times , where i 'm shouting , ' i 'm there			0
i want - - i want somebody to just , you know , come talk to me , you know , just shake my hand ' ... and i could n't get it			0
' @entity9 , who has created a foundation for reform of the criminal justice system , added : ' we 're driving people crazy			1
and this is our criminal justice system that 's supposed to serve and protect us			1
raising awareness : @entity9 , who has created a foundation for reform of the criminal justice system , said : ' we 're driving people crazy			1
and this is our criminal justice system that 's supposed to serve and protect us ' ' but we are literally driving men insane			1
and those that are already insane , we 're just putting them in the casket			0
that 's all we 're doing			0
' when @entity9 was released in october 2010 , he blamed his 1994 conviction and subsequent death sentence on lawmakers who follow polls that show enduring support for the death penalty			2
' what has to happen is someone famous , someone that they admire , has to be falsely accused or has to be convicted , to where they say , ' @entity228 , this has become an epidemic , ' because now they can relate , ' he said in an interview at the time			0
but he was also overwhelmingly grateful to the people who had helped to get him out , including local college students , members of the public and his attorneys , @entity240 reported			0
the @entity246 advises that prisoners who are considered ' mentally ill ' should not be placed in solitary confinement because it could exacerbate their health issues .			2
