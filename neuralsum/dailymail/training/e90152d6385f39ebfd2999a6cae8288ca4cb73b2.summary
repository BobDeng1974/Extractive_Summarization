criticising @entity17 ’s promise to claw back powers from @entity19 , @entity1 suggested that his tough line on @entity11 was an insincere attempt to counter the rise of the @entity24 @entity23			1
despite being a supposedly neutral public servant , mr @entity1 – a former prime minister of @entity27 – suggested @entity23 would beat the @entity28 in next year ’s @entity30 elections because ‘ when it comes to being against @entity11 , people prefer the original to the copy ’			1
but a source close to mr @entity17 said mr @entity1 should ‘ respect the views of the governing party elected by @entity24 ’			1
he suggested it might be ‘ more convenient ’ for mr @entity1 if @entity23 did well , because he could ignore them , adding : ‘ the prime minister will continue to stand up for the @entity24 people , fighting to ensure they get the best deal in @entity11 and have a say on it in a referendum by 2017			1
’ mr @entity1 ’s comments came in his annual address to the @entity30			2
in a thinly veiled attack on mr @entity17 , he insisted @entity11 needed ‘ more integration ’ , not less			2
he said : ‘ let me say this to all those who rejoice in @entity11 ’s difficulties and who want to roll back our integration and go back to isolation – the pre-integrated @entity11 of the divisions , the war , the trenches , is not what people desire and deserve			1

it is our duty to preserve it and deepen it			0
’ in exchanges with @entity83 , the @entity28 leader in the @entity30 , mr @entity1 said : ‘ your party is looking like @entity23			1
‘ @entity23 may finish first in @entity24			1
i have some doubts whether you are going to be elected or if it is not @entity23 that will be the first force in @entity24 elections			2
that is probably why they are going to vote for [ @entity68 ] @entity68			0
’ mr @entity83 last night condemned the intervention as ‘ outrageous ’ , adding : ‘ he is effectively a civil servant , but he has turned it into an increasingly political role			0
‘ the idea that the alternative to greater @entity97 integration is a return to us fighting each other in the trenches of the @entity6 is just risible			2
‘ @entity17 has got him rattled			0
he thought he could isolate @entity24 , but there is growing support for the prime minister ’s ideas in @entity106 , the @entity107 and others			0
’ @entity97 residents should pay the same for all international phone calls across its 28 nations , @entity19 said last night			0
mr @entity1 also wants to abolish mobile roaming charges in the @entity97			0
proposed legislation would stop customers paying for incoming calls when travelling in the @entity97 from july 2014			0
it would end all roaming charges two years later			0
the plan , which must still be approved by the @entity30 and all @entity97 governments , also aims to cap @entity97 - international fixed - line call costs the same as domestic long - distance calls .			0
