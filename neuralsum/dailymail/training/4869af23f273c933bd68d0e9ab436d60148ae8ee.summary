this year saw football fans treated to a plethora of enthralling competitions and memorable matches typified by an enthralling @entity4 in @entity5			1
with each calender year that passes , a handful of truly memorable goals are scored by some of the biggest names in sport as well as some of the lesser known talents across the globe			1
from @entity18 's gravity - defying header against @entity19 to @entity21 's 60 - yard strike for @entity23 side @entity22 , there were some beauties			1
here , @entity25 picks 10 of the best goals from 2014			1
@entity27 – @entity29 2 - 0 @entity28 ( @entity4 , 28/06/14 ) one of the most iconic moments of the @entity31 in @entity5 produced by the star of the tournament			1
a neat , cushioned header was played to @entity27 who was facing away from goal			1
the @entity29 set himself , positioned his body to chest - control the ball , before turning and unleashing an unstoppable left - footed volley into the top corner of the net from 25 yards			1
@entity27 fires @entity43 into a 1 - 0 lead against @entity28 during the @entity31 the @entity43 forward was one of the standout performers during the @entity4 in @entity5 @entity18 – @entity19 1 - 5 @entity47 ( @entity4 , 13/06/14 ) this goal gets a place in the list because it really was quite extraordinary			1
in terms of the context of the match , @entity52 ’s header totally changed it in the favour of the @entity58 – who roared back to demolish the defending champions 5 - 1			2
but the technique itself was also exquisite			0
a long , diagonal ball was played in behind the @entity19 defence and @entity52 , after just arriving in the box , arched his back and completely threw himself off the ground to lob a header over the top of @entity70 and into the net from 16 yards			1
@entity18 scored with this memorable header during @entity47 's 5 - 1 @entity4 win against @entity19 @entity52 's header pulled @entity47 level and sent his team on their way to a 5 - 1 victory @entity78 – @entity81 1 - 4 @entity80 ( @entity79 , 09/12/14 ) this goal produced a one of those ‘ oh my goodness – did that actually just happen ? ’ moments			1
@entity89 ’s corner was extremely poor and was headed towards what appeared like relative safety by the @entity81 defence			2
however , @entity78 caught the ball on the half - volley and arrowed an unstoppable effort from 30 yards into the very top left - hand corner of the net			1
the accuracy and precision of the shot was masterful			0
@entity80 players celebrate @entity78 's stunning strike against @entity81 earlier this month @entity104 – @entity105 5 - 3 @entity106 ( @entity107 , 21/09/14 ) many people questioned the logic in @entity106 paying £ 60million for another attacking midfielder last summer when it was their defence they needed to focus on , but @entity112 proved his class in this one goal alone			1
picking the ball up in his own half , he advanced 25 yards before passing to @entity117			0
after continuing his run to the edge of the box , @entity112 received a return ball from @entity117 and , with two @entity105 defenders closing him down , dug his foot under the ball from just inside the area and deliciously chipped @entity126 , who was three yards off his line			0
@entity104 brings the ball towards goal during @entity106 's clash against @entity131 in september @entity112 makes the perfect connection with the ball with his left foot with @entity126 out of his goal @entity126 can only look on as the ball floats over his net and looks set to double @entity106 's lead @entity112 scored arguably his best goal in a @entity106 shirt so far with the delightful chip against @entity105 the @entity143 midfielder has scored three goals since joining @entity106 from @entity145 in the summer @entity146 – @entity148 4 - 1 @entity147 ( @entity107 , 26/04/14 ) @entity149 will not remember this one fondly , but @entity146 certainly will			1
@entity147 keeper @entity149 had thrown the ball out to his defence and certainly did not expect it to be in the back of his net just moments later			2
despite @entity147 ’s deficiencies leading to this goal , nothing can be taken away from @entity146 ’s strike though			1
after controlling the failed clearance on his chest a fully 50 - yards out , the midfielder waited for the ball to bounce back up before belting a shot with the outside of his right foot that swerved and dipped into the top right - hand corner of the net			2
brilliant for @entity146 , embarrassing for @entity147			1
@entity146 chested down a @entity149 clearance before volleying home from 50 - yards the midfielder wheels away in celebration of his wonder striker against @entity147 @entity174 had no chance of saving @entity146 's strike at the @entity177 in april @entity178 – @entity179 0 - 1 @entity180 ( @entity181 , 15/03/14 ) this goal is so unique that it is actually quite hard to describe			1
@entity184 was running forward and was halfway into the @entity185 before a chipped through - ball was seemingly played too far behind him			2
the @entity180 forward was not put off , however , and stuck his right leg behind his body , flicking the ball into the air and it flew over the top of the @entity179 keeper and into the net from 25 yards			0
was it intentional ? possibly not , but it was still exceptional			0
@entity197 – @entity198 4 - 2 @entity199 ( @entity200 , 08/05/14 ) @entity201 will never , ever hit a ball more sweetly than this			0
there seemed to be little danger as the @entity207 goalkeeper cleared the ball to @entity209 ’s @entity201 during this match in @entity211 , but suddenly the ball was in the back of the net			0
with the ball still travelling at some speed in the air after the goalkeeper ’s clearance , @entity201 smashed a right - footed volley from inside the centre circle			2
it went high into the air and then dipped into the left - hand corner of the @entity207 net , with the goalkeeper sent sprawling			0
it seems to have been just a one of those ‘ swing it and see what happens ' shots , but credit where it is due			0
@entity235 – @entity237 3 - 1 @entity236 ( @entity238 , 18/01/14 ) all @entity240 fans will be thinking after seeing this is , if @entity244 ’ cousin can score wondergoals like this , have the @entity242 bought the wrong family member ? after picking the ball up in his own half , @entity244 suddenly decided he was going to have a go against @entity251 he advanced past two players , then another couple , weaving in and out exquisitely , before breaking through the defence and gently chipping a shot over the advancing goalkeeper			0
in total , @entity244 beat seven players and travelled more than 60 yards with the ball before scoring			0
how @entity240 fans long to see that from @entity244 ... @entity262 – @entity263 2 - 0 @entity47 ( @entity264 , 05/03/14 ) sometimes goals are special because they look bizarre , and this is one of those occasions			2
@entity268 had attacked down the right - hand side for @entity270 against @entity47 before playing a chipped cross into the box			0
the ball was slightly behind @entity279 midfielder @entity262 , but the @entity263 arched his body and then jumped into the air , both feet off the ground , before meeting the cross with the inside of his right foot as he feel backwards the other way			0
it flew into the back of the net and was a very unusual example of a bicycle kick			0
certainly not your orthodox , everyday goal anyway			0
@entity262 connects with his unique version of a bicycle kick during a friendly against @entity47 @entity21 – @entity293 1 - 3 @entity22 ( @entity294 , 22/02/14 ) this is surely the finest goal scored in @entity23 in 2014			1
@entity21 was five yards into his own half taking and throw - in and , after a @entity293 midfielder managed to win the header , it flew back towards the @entity22 right back			2
despite being practically on the halfway line and just two yards from the side of the pitch , @entity21 had spotted the @entity293 goalkeeper off his line and decided to launch both feet off the ground and smash a left - footed effort which looped high into the air , before fooling the @entity293 goalkeeper – who could not tip it over – and bouncing in via the post			0
audacious , ambitious and utterly brilliant .			0
