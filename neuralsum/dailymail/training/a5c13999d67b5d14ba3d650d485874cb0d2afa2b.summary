by @entity0 published : 10:32 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 18:39 est , 12 july 2012 according to sister @entity2 , it will stand as a ‘ symbol of hope ’ offering ‘ spiritual protection ’ to all who look at it			1
but the nun ’s plan to put up a 24ft high illuminated cross at the bottom of her 30ft long garden has left her neighbours , well , cross			1
sister @entity2 , 68 , has triggered an almighty debate after lodging a planning application to build the led - lit cross in the back garden of her two - bedroom bungalow			1
she says she plans three hours of prayers at the cross each day			1
backyard worship : sister @entity2 wants to build a 24ft high cross in her backyard ( pictured ) saying it wo n't ' obliterate anyone 's view ' godly garden : sister @entity2 included an example of what her illuminated cross might look like in her application to council the nun says the ‘ @entity40 ’ would be 24ft high , with the cross beam measuring 4ft , lit in blue and white which would ‘ not obliterate anyone ’s view ’			1
she is now ‘ earnestly praying for the money to come in ’ to fund the structure			2
it would be a 1/100th scale replica of the @entity45 which was proposed to mark claims made in the 1970s by a woman from the @entity49 village of @entity50 that she had seen @entity51 49 times			0
although the cross was never built , around 4,000 scale - sized crosses are said to have been built around the world			0
@entity56 , who lives at the rear of sister @entity2 ’s home in @entity60 , near @entity61 , said the structure was not in keeping with a residential area , would be visible from her property and would cause light pollution			2
@entity67 object : nearby residents have objected to the plans saying the shining cross at the nun 's house in @entity60 , @entity73 ( pictured ) will be an eyesore and ' a blight on the skyline ' decision pending : the plans showing the cross ' dimensions ( pictured ) are before @entity80 @entity81 , objecting on behalf of an elderly relative , said : ‘ the light will be shining straight into her bedroom			1
’ others , though , welcomed sister @entity2 ’s plans			2
one resident said an illuminated cross would complement and unite @entity61 and @entity73 with a unique identity			1
sister @entity2 said yesterday : ‘ i have spoken to an architect who has come up with some plans			2
it would be made of steel and we want the light to bring hope and confidence to people			0
i have spoken to the neighbours at the back and they did not have a problem			0
’ sister @entity2 also hit the headlines in 2006 after travelling from @entity73 to the @entity104 to protest at the premiere of the movie @entity106			1
she claims to belong to @entity108 ’s @entity107 in @entity61			2
but the @entity109 has said @entity110 is not ‘ canonically recognised ’ even if she does do ‘ good works ’			0
she is known to have spent three years with a closed @entity113 order in @entity114 , but decided to continue wearing a slightly modified habit despite no longer being a fully - fledged nun			0
a spokesman for the @entity118 , in which she lives , said she was now a ‘ maverick ’ and a ‘ one - woman order ’			0
@entity80 will make a decision on the application following a consultation period which ends on july 21			1
the omens , however , do not look promising			0
sister @entity2 ’s planning application number is 666 – a number widely associated with the devil			0
a council spokesman said it was ‘ entirely coincidental ’			1
@entity106 protest : sister @entity2 made international headline when she protested against movie @entity106 by holding a 12 hour vigil with @entity136 , 31 , infront of @entity137 where scenes were shot @entity139 ( left ) protested about @entity106 which starred actor @entity140 ( right at the film 's world premier at the @entity104 ) because she believed the story by @entity144 to be heresy saying ' when i face almighty @entity147 at my final judgement , as we all will , i can say i did try my best			0
i did try my best to protest '			0

it will provide ‘ spiritual protection for @entity61 and @entity73 ’ according to the application
the local council is yet to make a decision
residents have objected to the plans saying it will be an eyesore
