his comments on space travel came during a traditional sake bottle breaking ceremony , conducted with the help of astronauts @entity13 and @entity15 in @entity16			0
going native : @entity0 obligingly donned a red @entity19 robe for his role in the sake barrel breaking ceremony suits you sir : @entity0 looked surprisingly at ease in the colourful crimson ensemble boost for @entity26 : in @entity16 , @entity0 helped launch the innovation is great campaign ' when i was younger , i dreamed of being an astronaut , but i also wanted to be a policeman or a fire - breather , ' said the @entity0 , adding : ' that might have been a bit alternative			1
' but with his mind now firmly on @entity37 goings on , not least the imminent arrival of his second child , @entity0 confessed that he has since changed his mind			0
asked whether he would still like to go into space , he quipped : ' i do n’t think my @entity42 will make it that far up			0
it seems like an awfully long way from the ground			0
' @entity0 followed that up with a speech , during which he said sorry for not bringing @entity48 and @entity49 , but added : ' i know that she looks forward to visiting @entity3 in the future			2
' the afternoon speech came after a morning spent visiting the @entity8 in @entity53 - precisely twenty years after his mother visited			1

the floral tribute of chrysanthemums included a note written and signed by the @entity56 , which said : ' may we never forget all those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom			2
' more than 1,500 soldiers , sailors and airmen , many of them @entity26 prisoners of war , are buried at the tranquil cemetery , which is a short drive from central @entity86			2
their plots are marked by simple name plates and grouped by nations including sites for @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity95 forces			1
memories : princess @entity62 , seen here at the @entity97 , visited @entity3 in 1995 snap : the scene at the cemetery today recalled the moment princess @entity62 visited 20 years ago @entity100 : the princess ' visit sparked chaotic scenes as @entity3 fell , en masse , for her charms popular : the crowds also turned out for her son , who was welcomed by hundreds as he arrived yesterday welcome : princess @entity62 , like her son , also met @entity4 and is seen here at a state dinner after @entity112 fell in 1942 , prisoners were transferred to a camp in @entity114 , near @entity53 , and sent to work in mines , factories and dockyards			1

speaking after the @entity56 had laid his wreath , captain @entity127 , the @entity26 's defence attaché in @entity3 , gave a short speech			1

' after the ceremony , the @entity56 walked among the graves with capt @entity127 , as well as the @entity158 defence attaché captain @entity159 and @entity160 , representing @entity3			1

paying his respects : @entity0 chatted to some of the local staff who maintain the cemetery during his visit poignant : at the end of his visit , @entity0 was asked to sign a visitors ' book placed beside a photo of @entity62 taking a moment : he stopped to look at the photo and read the caption inscribed on it signing : he then added his name to the visitor 's book before travelling back to @entity86 happy memories : the frame contained a photo of the princess during her 1995 visit to @entity8 @entity186 : the 1,500 @entity26 and @entity143 soldiers at @entity8 occupy a particularly peaceful spot @entity3 boasts the oldest continual hereditary monarchy in the world , beginning with @entity191 who reigned from 660 bc. since then , 125 emperors have come and gone , with the most recent , @entity193 , famous for being head of state during the @entity195			1

the picture , which showed princess @entity62 laying a wreath at the same cemetery in 1995 , was captioned : ' may she rest in peace '			1
@entity62 's 1995 visit to @entity3 had sparked chaotic scenes , with the country succumbing en - masse to her charms , sparking what commentators later described as ' @entity215 '			1
her son , who is adored in @entity3 in part because of his mother , found himself at the centre of similarly sized crowds yesterday			2
explaining the @entity56 's appeal , one well - wisher , @entity221 , said : ' he is cool and handsome			2
and very tall ! ' that height became even more apparent during his meeting with the diminutive emperor akihito today , with 6ft 2 " @entity0 courteously inclining his head as he was introduced to the @entity3 head of state			2
