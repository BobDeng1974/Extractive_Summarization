prince @entity0 is famous for his love of plants but it seems the @entity4 loves flowers just as much as her eldest son			1
according to @entity8 , the monarch adores her garden so much , she has a weekly posy cut and delivered to her on monday mornings when she returns to @entity12 from @entity13			1
the half - dozen blooms are taken from the palace gardens and are a gift from her gardeners , who like to show off the latest fruits of their labours			2
keen gardener : the queen , seen here with the @entity23 , is a keen gardener weekly gift : the queen is handed a posy by her gardeners every week so she can see what is in season ' she has a little posy cut for her every monday , which is placed on her desk when she gets back from @entity13 , ' said @entity8			1
' it will typically have six or seven different types of flowers from the garden to give her a little snapshot of what 's looking good at that time			2
' currently , that means honeysuckle , winter jasmine and blueberries , although the selection changes depending on the season			0
@entity8 made the revelations during an interview with the @entity44 to promote @entity45 , a documentary about the @entity12 grounds which is due to be screened on christmas day			1
the veteran gardener was given unfettered access to the palace gardens for a year and was allowed to place cameras in trees in order to chart its progress through the year			0
the result is a rare snapshot of the @entity4 's 40 - acre private gardens in all their glory - complete with 35 types of mulberry and a rare white helleborine orchid			1
insider : @entity8 is behind a new documentary that explores the @entity12 grounds sprawling : the @entity12 gardens cover 40 acres and are home to 35 species of mulberry bush also captured on the motion sensing cameras is the local wildlife , among them foxes and hedgehogs , although the monarch hardly features at all			1
that , explains @entity8 , is because the royal gardeners are enormously protective of their employer			0
' the gardeners are quite cagey [ about ] talking about what the @entity4 likes , ' he says			2
' but what becomes quite evident is she loves what we would call @entity83 cottage garden flowers - unostentatious flowers , not things that are too exotic			1
' not , however , that the @entity4 is shy of making her feelings on planting clear			0
' if it 's a quick replanting of a bed , they would n't bother her much with that , ' says @entity90			0
' but she is very much involved with major changes			0
' the summer garden parties were always in july but now they have been moved earlier to june , that means adjusting the planting scheme to make the borders brighter earlier			0
' she would be consulted about that sort of thing			0
' wildlife : along with foxes and hedgehogs , @entity12 is also home to several hives of honeybees public : the beautiful gardens are opened to a select group of guests each june			2
