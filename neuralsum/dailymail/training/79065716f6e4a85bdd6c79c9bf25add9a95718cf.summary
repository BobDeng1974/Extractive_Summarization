by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity2 has vowed to undercut @entity3 with his new company @entity4			2
@entity4 will be launched in @entity5 and @entity6 the @entity8 retail baron behind @entity9 and @entity4 has entered the supermarket price war by vowing to undercut @entity3			1
sir @entity2 said @entity4 , which is about to be tested in two stores with plans to open in more than 140 , will be 10 per cent cheaper than the @entity8 ’s largest grocers when it launches			1
the big four supermarkets , which also include @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , are poised for a price slashing drive to take on discount rivals @entity21 and @entity22			2
this was sparked by @entity15 , which earlier this month vowed to spend £ 1billion lowering the price of many basic foods after losing ground to the smaller cut - price competitors			1
the move led @entity16 to pledge a similar sum towards cutting price tags			0
@entity4 , which is loss - making and has struggled in recent years against rivals such as @entity33 and @entity34 , announced plans to start selling food at the end of last year			1
but over the weekend the billionaire retailer behind the group said he would slash food prices to become more competitive than major established supermarkets			2
‘ we know what we ’re getting into - the most competitive food landscape for some time , ’ said sir @entity2			1
‘ there ’s no point opening up and getting torn apart because we have n’t got competitive prices			0
’ the group has planned to cash in on the growing demand for convenience stores , which are the most thriving area of the @entity54			0
around 10 per cent of a large @entity4 store could be devoted to food halls , @entity2 has said			2
the trials , in @entity4 stores in @entity5 and @entity6 , are due to begin imminently and will see branded products such as bread , cakes , fizzy drinks and some frozen items			1
it is thought that he plans to sell these at parity with some supermarkets , but lower than others			0
for example a two litre bottle of @entity70 would be sold for £ 1 - the same as @entity16 but almost half the price of @entity15 and @entity17 ’s			1
a 170g jar of @entity76 gravy granules would be sold for £ 1 , which is in line with @entity15 but cheaper than @entity3 , @entity16 or @entity79 ’s			1
he added : ‘ on the basis that everyone is going into the high street and convenience maybe it ’s an opportunity			0
‘ if you do n’t buy a ticket you ca n’t win the lottery			0
’ sir @entity2 said @entity4 , which is about to be tested in two stores with plans to open in more than 140 , will be 10 per cent cheaper than the @entity8 's largest grocers when it launches he hopes the venture will turn around the fortunes of the chain , which last year posted a pre-tax loss of £ 71 million			1
although industry analysts are sceptical of the potential for @entity4 to make a major dent in the market on its own , it is thought the foray into food might tempt one of the larger players to enter into a deal with sir @entity2			2
with a network of 180 stores across the @entity8 , a tie - up with the tycoon would give any large supermarket instant access to a wide range of locations , analysts say			0
but if the venture fail he could be forced to sell the chain			0
@entity21 and @entity22 , both @entity118 companies , have thrived in the downturn as families look for ways to cut their weekly shopping bills			0
they have been the fastest growing of all the supermarkets , according to industry data.now it is thoughts that everyday items could fall by a quarter as the established grocers try to catch up .			0
