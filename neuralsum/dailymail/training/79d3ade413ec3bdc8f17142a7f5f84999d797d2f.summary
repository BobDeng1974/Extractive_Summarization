by @entity0 published : 08:42 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 01:48 est , 15 may 2013 the dramatic opening scenes of the hit @entity3 film @entity5 has been recreated - entirely out of @entity6			1
every single shot from @entity3 's famous gun barrel pose to the brutal bathroom fight scene starring @entity10 has been perfectly replicated in the three minute 29 second clip			1
the video was produced by 26 - year - old @entity6 enthusiast who runs the online community for ' everything @entity6 ' called @entity16			1
just like in the movie , @entity3 is sitting in a chair in the dark waiting for a @entity26 section chief he has been tasked with killing			0
it even includes the flashback to @entity3 's first kill - a gritty bathroom brawl ending with @entity3 's assailant drowned in a sink - before he kills his current target			0
and despite being made out of @entity6 , the clip - which is all in black and white just like the movie - retains the mystique of the original film			1
writing on www.bricktease.com , the creator of the @entity6 clip said : ' i started work on @entity5 about three weeks ago			1
confrontation : @entity3 accuses the @entity26 agent of leaking secret information for money in the clip which has identical camera angles to actual film attention is in the detail : the clip , which took three weeks to complete , even features @entity3 's flash back of the first man he killed @entity6 art : the 26 - year - old creator of the clip - who founded the website @entity76 - used stop motion animation to make the video ' i spend a fair bit of time going through the video and working out what scenes and camera angels there are , and plan my work to suit , so i do n’t waste any time			1
' i spent about two or three weeks actually filming , when i had a spare hour or two i would find a short scene or shot and do that			2
' i find that planning it all out really helps me work quickly and efficiently			0
' asked how he made the clip , he added : ' practice			2
if you see some of my very first videos , they are pretty amateur			0
wobbly camera , dodgy movement of pieces etc … over the last few videos i have been trying to get as smooth as possible			0
and i still have a long way to go ! ' he added that he always strives to use @entity6 as much as possible - such as the clear bricks representing the water in the sink			1
graphic : @entity6 bricks are even used to represent water as @entity3 attempts to drown his assailant in the bathroom sink set up : when the clip reverts back to the office , the @entity26 agent attempts to shoot @entity3 , but he has removed the bullets from his gun now a 007 : @entity3 then shoots the agent before another quick flashback to the bathroom where he shoots his first ever a kill iconic : the famous gun barrel fills the scene as the @entity3 theme tune starts to play he continued : ' i have a personal preference that i want the videos to be as immersive as possible			1
so you do n’t see anything that is n’t @entity6 unless you absolutely have to			2
' it is really hard to get lips moving that looks realistic , so i am avoiding it for now			0
but i will one day work out how to do it ( and do it well )			0
' the video has greeted with delight by @entity3 and @entity6 fans alike with 364,857 people having watched it on @entity139			2
despite calls for @entity16 to make an entire @entity6 version of the film , he admitted he did n't have enough actual @entity143 to do that			0
but he added he will be making a new clip every single month this year			2
now watch the original scene from @entity5			0
