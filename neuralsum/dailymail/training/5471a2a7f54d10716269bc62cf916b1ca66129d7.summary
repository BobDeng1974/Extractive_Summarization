by @entity0 two councillors who failed to pay their council tax have been granted anonymity – because naming and shaming them in court would violate their human rights			1
the pair owe a total of £ 4,660 but a senior judge said unmasking them risks causing ‘ unnecessary and unjustified damage and distress ’			1
campaigners yesterday condemned the ruling as evidence of a worrying culture of secrecy – saying the public must know the identity of elected politicians who do n’t pay the tax they help to set			2
failure to pay : two councillors from @entity22 ( pictured ) failed to pay a total of £ 4,660 in council tax			1
but they have been granted anonymity - because naming them in court would violate their human rights the councillors , one @entity29 and one conservative , had been summoned to court in @entity22 and arranged to pay their arrears in full for the periods 2011/12 and 2012/13			1
while their names would have been given on the day of the hearings , the cases were not reported at the time			0
the matter only came to light last year when local newspaper the @entity40 made a @entity42 request to @entity22 council			2
but when the @entity29 - controlled authority refused to identify the duo , citing data protection laws , the paper complained to the			0
criticism : @entity50 ( pictured ) , of the @entity49 , said @entity22 taxpayers would find the judge 's ruling ' thoroughly depressing ' the newspaper argued that there was a strong public interest in disclosing the pair ’s names as both could have been standing for re-election in may			1
in his ruling , the commissioner said it was ‘ reasonable ’ for someone in elected office to expect that failure to pay would be made public			0
but he added that council tax was a ‘ private matter ’ between residents and the local authority , and said the personal circumstances given by the councillors as mitigating factors were such that naming them would be ‘ unfair ’			1
a first - tier tribunal , which hears appeals against the decisions of public bodies , later backed the anonymity ruling			0
unusually , the council ’s lawyers even asked if they could contribute to the decision - making process			2
in a written judgment , judge @entity83 said the circumstances of the councillors ’ cases put them in a position where they could ‘ significantly and legitimately have expected not to be named ’			1
citing the @entity90 , he added : ‘ releasing the information could potentially cause unnecessary and unjustified damage and distress to the individuals			0
’ there are now no further appeal stages available , so the councillors ’ identity will remain a secret			1
while their mitigation has not been disclosed , personal information covered under data protection laws includes confidential medical issues			1
@entity50 , of the @entity49 ’ @entity49 , blasted a lack of ‘ transparency and accountability ’ , adding : ‘ @entity22 taxpayers will find this whole episode thoroughly depressing			0
those who have paid their fair share deserve to know which of their councillors are n’t doing the same			0
’ councillors in @entity22 receive a basic annual allowance of £ 11,082 , with additional payments for chairing committees or cabinet duties			1
@entity117 , of anti-council tax campaign group is it fair ? , said : ‘ when they ’re getting allowances of more than £ 11,000 a year , the least people can expect is for them to pay on time			2
’ @entity22 declined to say whether the pair were among the two councillors who lost their seats in may ’s elections			2
it also refused to say how much it spent fighting the case			0
but it said the tribunal ruling was correct , adding : ‘ we take our responsibility to protect personal data very seriously			0
’ the @entity132 said the decision struck the ‘ right balance between openness and accountability and personal privacy rights ’ .			0
