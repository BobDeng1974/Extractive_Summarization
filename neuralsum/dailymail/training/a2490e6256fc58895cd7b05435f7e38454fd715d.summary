@entity8 has not softened his views and he remains an ardent segregationist			2

the bodies were found 44 days later , buried miles away in a red - clay dam			1
in his four - hour interview with the @entity19 , @entity0 is talkative but his mind wanders , a problem he attributes to brain damage from a logging accident a few months before his trial			1
he says he has never and will never talk about the events that became immortalized in the film ' @entity51			0
' @entity0 first contacted an @entity19 reporter 18 months ago			2
in his first letter on march 3 , 2013 , he made clear that no conversation with a reporter would result in a confession			0
' @entity88 is not where i am coming from after 50 years of silence , ' @entity0 wrote			2
' i have never discussed the 1964 case with anyone — an attorney , the @entity47 , local law nor friend — and those who say so are lying			0
' since then , both he and the @entity19 filed repeated requests to have a reporter added to his visitation list			0
the @entity100 , citing a policy of not allowing media to see inmates , denied at least a dozen requests			0
the agency abruptly agreed this month			0
visitors are not allowed to bring pens , pencils or paper into the prison			0
@entity0 often leans in because he has trouble hearing and cups a hand to his left ear in the direction of guests sitting farther away			2
he speaks of associations with hundreds of people during his life — from political figures to friends and neighbors			0
@entity0 is talkative about corruption in the @entity5 prison system , his good times and close relationship with the late sen. @entity127 and his preaching at a tiny baptist church in east @entity5 from which he got the nickname ' preacher			1
' but his wife said no friends visit or write her husband			0
' they do n't come ; they do n't ask about him , ' @entity135 said as she left the visitors ' center at the prison			0
@entity0 said people at @entity20 were well aware of his identity before he arrived			1
they knew who i was , ' he said			0
@entity0 said he had some run - ins with black prisoners and had received threats but nothing ever came from them			1
he wo n't talk about his well - known association with the @entity68 as an organizer			1
he does say he knew some people in the @entity68			1
a question about what he thought of the testimony of friends at his trial drew his anger			0
' friends ? what friends ? you talking about @entity163 ? ' @entity163 testified that he was 10 years old and sitting on his grandfather 's porch one sunday in 1967 listening to @entity0 and his grandfather talk			2
' my grandfather asked him , did he have anything to do with those boys being killed , ' said @entity163 , who was serving a 30 - year sentence for rape			1
' he told my grandfather yes , and he was proud of it			0
' national attention : dr. @entity175 is seen with a photo of the victims in december 1964 during a press conference after it emerged that 20 men were arrested in connection to the slayings big screen adaptation : @entity0 says he has never and will never talk about the events that became immortalized in ' @entity51 ' slayings : this 1964 photo released by the @entity47 shows the uncovered bodies of the victims from an earthen dam southwest of @entity62 , @entity5 tight - lipped : in his recent interview , @entity0 would n't say much about the 1964 killings			1
he said he remains a segregationist who does not believe in race equality but contends he bears no ill will toward blacks @entity0 said he did n't know @entity163 , and never visited the house			1
' i think i would remember if i did that , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity58 's sister , the rev. @entity199 of @entity200 , @entity201 , said she was not surprised @entity0 would n't talk about the slayings			1
' i can only wish mr. @entity0 peace at this juncture in his life			2
... if he can achieve a modicum of peace , i wish that for him , ' @entity58 said			0
@entity0 's first trial on federal conspiracy charges was held in 1967 , but the all - white jury could not reach a verdict			1
one juror said she could not convict a preacher			0
of the seven who were convicted , none served more than six years			0
because many of those who testified in 1967 were no longer available , prosecutors got permission to have others read transcripts of the earlier testimony into the new court record			0
a convergence of factors led to a new trial in 2005			0
there was a new district attorney and @entity5 attorney general , persistent media coverage and advocacy groups urging a closer look			0
in the 2005 trial , attorney general @entity231 acknowledged that @entity0 did not shoot the men himself , but said @entity0 's role as organizer made him just as guilty as those who fired the guns			1
testimony read in court showed @entity0 ordered fellow @entity68 to attack @entity28 , @entity58 and @entity27 and then went to a funeral home to create an alibi for himself			1
@entity242 , a @entity243 who has since died , testified for the prosecution in 1967 that @entity0 showed the killers where the men were jailed and where to wait to hunt them down once they were released			2
as carloads of @entity68 drove off to intercept the three doomed men , @entity242 said , they let @entity0 off at a funeral home			1
' he said he had to go there because if anything happened , he would be the first one questioned , ' @entity242 said			0
@entity0 's only response today to any of that was his often repeated contention that he is not a criminal convict but a political prisoner			2
one thing of which he is certain : ' i could have beat that thing if i 'd had the mental ability , ' @entity0 said , tapping his bald head			2
family : @entity0 is pictured in june 2005 with wife @entity135 during his murder trial			2
@entity0 walked out of federal court in 1967 because the jury could not reach a verdict , but in 2005 he was convicted of manslaughter			2
