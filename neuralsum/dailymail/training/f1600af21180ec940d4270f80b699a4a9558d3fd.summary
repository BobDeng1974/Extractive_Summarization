communication director @entity8 could *n't* contain her anger over @entity10 's article about @entity2 's *faltering* @entity23 mayoral campaign
@entity10 claimed many interns only joined the campaign to get close to @entity83 ahead of @entity87 's expected 2016 presidential run
she said @entity2 *mistakenly* called her and other interns @entity91
@entity8 called @entity10 a series a *expletives* , apparently *unaware* that her rant was ' on the record '
she has since issued an apology and said she *contacted* @entity10 to *personally* say she was sorry
