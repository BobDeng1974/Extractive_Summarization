by @entity1 reporter published : 07:45 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 11:21 est , 21 november 2013 there was sufficient proof that former @entity5 prime minister @entity4 had sex with an underage nightclub dancer in exchange for cash and jewellery a court in @entity5 has heard			1
new documents released to a @entity14 court today show that prosecutors were satisfied that @entity4 had sex with @entity17 knowing she was underage - a consensus which led to his conviction in for using underage prostitutes earlier this year			1
the court handed @entity4 a seven - year jail sentence in june for abuse of office and paying for sex with a minor			1
but although the judgement was made public at the time , the reasons behind conviction have remained secret until now			1
protesting his innocence : @entity4 always maintained he did n't know @entity32 was when he paid her for sex underage : @entity35 @entity34 , nicknamed @entity32 , was 17 when @entity4 paid her for sex but in an explosive document released today it is revealed that the court found ' it is proved that the defendant had sexual relations with miss @entity17 - known as @entity32 the @entity42 - in exchange for considerable sums of money and other items such as jewellery			1
' judges also concluded that the disgraced politician was the director of bunga bunga parties where female guests ' worked to satisfy the desires of the defendant ... staging lap dances and stripteases '			1
following the high profile court case in june the three - time premier was found guilty of having sex with a minor and for abuse of office in trying to cover it up , but he still has two levels of appeal before the conviction and eventual punishment is confirmed by @entity5 courts			1
and the case involving miss @entity17 is just the latest in a long line of scandals that has seen the 77 - year - old former leader rarely out of the @entity5 courts in the last few years			1
in august the disgraced politician lost his final appeal over a fraud conviction which handed him a four - year jail term			1
as a result he faces the loss of his senate seat for 24 months under a ruling by an appeals court in his home town of @entity14			0
under a 2012 law , anyone convicted to more than two years in prison can not hold or run for office for six years			0
it is the second political ban process to be set in motion following @entity4 's failed appeal this summer			2
even before his conviction over miss @entity90 was already at risk of being kicked out of parliament under this law , as a result of a five - year political ban for a previous tax fraud conviction			1
however , the court was ordered by @entity5 's highest judges to reassess the length of the ban after prosecutors admitting errors in sentencing			0
mr @entity4 's legal team have already pledged to appeal the two - year ban to @entity5 's highest criminal court - a move that could be rendered futile if the six - year expulsion is already in place			1
if approved by parliament , the ban will prevent @entity4 from wholly participating in new elections - but he could remain the titular head of his party without holding political office			1
and shockingly @entity5 polls repeatedly show that many would still vote for him despite his outragous personal life			0
but despite losing his appeal the media tycoon is unlikely to see the inside of a jail any time soon			0
his four year sentence has already been reduced to one year - under an amnesty for crimes committed before 2006 - because of his age and he has opted for the cushier choice of 12 months ' community service			2
high flying : the court documents revealed that miss @entity17 was given ' considerable sums of money ' and jewellery to have sex with the prime minister this means that although he will have to join other convicts in carrying out menial tasks , such as cutting the grass in public parks , painting sheltered accommodation or picking up litter he will not be punished with any form or imprisonment or even house arrest			1
but the conviction poses a serious threat to his decades - long political career and @entity4 has threatened repeatedly to bring down prime minister @entity152 's broad left - right coalition government if the @entity154 votes to expel him from parliament on nov. 27			1
it 's not all bad news though as the former premier did eventually find one court on his side a judge in @entity162 has cut his alimony payments in half - to a mere £ 1.2million a month			0
he had previously been ordered to pay ex-wife @entity164 , whom he first met when he saw her topless on stage , a cool £ 2.5million a month			0
@entity4 was famously divorced in 2009 by @entity167 after she saw him photographed at an underwear model 's 18th birthday party			2
at the time she said she could no longer stay with someone who spent time with ' minors ' and pointed out that he had never turned up to any of his own children 's 18th birthday parties			0
earlier in the year the billionaire had been forced to take out full - page adverts in the newspapers to apologise to her for telling another woman - a guest at a tv awards dinner - that he wanted to marry her instead			2
bitter dispute : @entity164 and @entity4 pictured in 2004 before she filed for divorce in 2009			2
in an open letter open published around the same time she said she and her children had suffered through her husband 's affairs ' if i was n't married , i would marry you right away , ' he told showgirl turned politician @entity189			0
@entity4 was married to @entity167 for the best part of 20 years and has three children with her - @entity192 , 29 , @entity193 , 27 , and @entity194 , 25			2
he was previously married to @entity195 with whom he had his first two children @entity197 , 47 , and @entity198 , 44			0
last month he reportedly married his fiancée in a secret wedding at his private chapel			0
the three - time @entity5 premier , who is nearly 50 years older than his bride , wed former tv showgirl @entity204 , 28 , at a church inside his palatial villa near @entity14 in early october			0
the couple , who met when miss @entity204 was a teenage activist in @entity4 's his @entity209 party , wed despite a string of allegations that their relationship is ‘ a sham ’			2
miss @entity204 is seeking @entity215 damages after a tv station broadcast claims by @entity219 actress @entity218 that she is in fact a lesbian			0
she says the comments are defamatory .			0

@entity4 was handed a seven - year jail sentence in june for having sex with the underage dancer whose real name is @entity17
but although the judgement was made public then the judges ' reasons behind the conviction have remained secret until now
new document show judges concluded he was the director of bunga bunga parties where female guests ' worked to satisfy the desires of the defendant '
