sir @entity0 had to settle for second best on his track comeback on thursday , when his @entity4 team were thrashed by @entity5 in the men ’s team pursuit final			1
but on an evening when he effectively confirmed he would never again ride in any of cycling ’s grand tours , including the @entity11 , @entity8 insisted defeat was part and parcel of a process that he hopes will end in @entity18 glory on the track in @entity20 in 2016			1
@entity8 , who quickly removed his silver medal after the ceremony , said : ‘ i ’m disappointed we came second here , but in hindsight we ’ll look back and think this is a start point for us now			1
’ the @entity5 quartet , spearheaded by @entity51 , pulverised @entity8 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , taking gold in a @entity31 record of 3min 54.851sec			1
@entity4 trailed in on 4min 0.136sec			1
@entity8 , a four - times olympic gold medallist , 2012 @entity11 winner and @entity58 of the realm , said : ‘ it takes four people to be on par and firing on all cylinders to succeed ( in the pursuit ) and ( this team ) all had different preparation this year			1
so there ’s a lot of positives to take from it			2
’ he added : ‘ i do n’t want to sound like ( @entity4 manager ) @entity72 , but we ’ve definitely got some work to do			1
’ @entity8 said there was no doubt in his mind that he still has the ability to be competitive on the track at world level			1
‘ i certainly have answered the questions on whether i can still do it or not , but i still think there ’s room for improvement and it ’s going to take a lot of dedication to the track , ’ he said			2
‘ we were all just on different levels			0
and the strategy was that if i could go longer and ease the strain off , that ’s what team pursuit is about , getting the four riders to the finish			0
it ’s not going to be easy			0
the @entity5 set the standard again			2
dejected : @entity8 looks glum after losing out on gold to @entity5 in the men 's team pursuit final out in front : @entity8 leads the way but @entity4 could n't cope with @entity5 's speed in the final too good : @entity5 's @entity105 celebrates after helping his country win gold at the sir @entity35 all smiles : @entity5 duo @entity109 and @entity110 raise their arms in celebration at the end of the race @entity28 off to thrilling start & medal table ‘ we ’ve been in that position before and it ’s not a bad position to be in			1
we ’ve done two world - class rides from four weeks together			0
’ @entity8 has been surprised by the warm welcome the @entity4 team have had north of the border			1
‘ the buzz around the city has been incredible			0
you get free coffees and everything , ’ he said			0
‘ i think it ’s surprised all of us especially being from @entity4			2
’ this was his first and only event of these games and he will not compete in another			0
‘ i rode [ in my first @entity31 ] 16 years ago , so i wo n’t be riding in another , ’ he said			2
‘ but the atmosphere of it			0
’ he revealed further grand tours on the road will be ruled out because ‘ heavier , more explosive ’ road riding will not be compatible with the track regime he will need for @entity20			0
‘ i do n’t think the road will complement it , ’ he said			0
forward planning : @entity8 has ruled himself out of future road races as he prepares for the 2016 @entity18 same again : @entity4 trio ( from left to right ) @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 also won silver in the team sprint after @entity8 silver , @entity4 ’s men ’s sprint team — @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity151 — were also beaten to the gold , by @entity159 — who ended a 12 - year @entity162 gold drought in track cycling in the process			1
but there was some good news for @entity4 cycling as teenager @entity168 took the first para-cycling gold medal of the @entity31 by winning the tandem sprint for blind and visually - impaired athletes			1
the 18 - year - old from @entity173 , riding with pilot @entity174 , 24 today , has a form of albinism that gives her only nine per cent vision			0
the pair were thrilled to top the podium at the @entity35 velodrome by beating @entity182 @entity181 and @entity183 in the final			2
‘ we ’ve only been together three months this time , but we were together for four months before and it has just fallen into place , ’ @entity168 said			0
@entity188 is in the @entity31 for the first time , and she added : ‘ now we ’ve put on a good show perhaps it can feature in future games			0
’ on winning in @entity182 , she said : ‘ i ’m not gon na lie , it feels really good , it feels like a home games			2

@entity5 *emerged* victorious with a winning margin in *excess* of five seconds at the sir @entity35
@entity8 was unable to help @entity4 mount a comeback after a slow start
@entity110 was forced to drop out during the race
@entity53 , @entity52 and @entity54 rode *alongside* @entity8
