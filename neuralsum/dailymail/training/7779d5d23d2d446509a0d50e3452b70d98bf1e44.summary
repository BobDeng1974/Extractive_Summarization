by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:07 am on 9th august 2011 endurance swimmer @entity2 , who attempted to become the first person to swim between @entity4 and @entity5 without a shark cage , was forced to abandon her effort early this morning - roughly halfway through her journey			1
@entity2 was vomiting when she was brought aboard a boat at 12.45am , 29 hours after she jumped into the water on sunday			1
' i am not sad			2
it was absolutely the right call , ' she said			1
@entity2 , who is 61 , struggled through ocean swells , shoulder pain and asthma monday before she was forced to give up the 103 - mile swim			1
@entity17 swimmer @entity2 poses for reporters before her attempt to swim to @entity5 from @entity19 , at dusk on sunday morning the swimmer flashed a victory sign at her well - wishers before performing a rendition of @entity25 on her bugle , ahead of her challenge she was hoping to become the first person to swim from @entity19 to @entity28 without a shark cage			1
the challenge – which she also failed to beat at the age of 28 – would have taken 60 hours			2
tanned and freckled from long hours training in the open seas of the @entity34 , she seemed confident before starting off just before sunset sunday			2
she said the still air and shimmering water flat as a plate were perfect conditions for her attempt to make the epic swim			2
' the adrenaline 's flowing now , ' @entity2 said at a jetty in western @entity19 as she looked at the water			1
' ... this is what i dreamed of : a silver platter			2
' she gave a heartfelt cheek - kiss to the commodore of the @entity52 in @entity19 , who helped arrange logistics of the trip , changed into a black swimsuit and blue swim cap and showed off the goggles she planned to wear : light blue during the night for better dark vision and smoky charcoal tinted to protect her eyes from the blinding daytime sun. after an assistant greased her shoulders and armpits to prevent chafing in the salty water , @entity2 played ' @entity25 ' on a bugle , thanked several dozen well - wishers who came to see her , then jumped feet first into the sea			1
@entity2 said it has been a lifelong dream and she hoped would inspire people to live vigorously during their golden years			1
there she goes : the 166 kilometer stretch between @entity4 and the @entity78 of @entity5 is expected to take three days instead of using a cage , @entity2 will rely on divers and the deployment of an electronic boom to surround her with a current that is imperceptible to humans but is strong enough to keep most sharks at bay ' thirty - three years ago i stood on a beach close by here and looked out at a giant sea			1
... now i 'm almost 62 years old and i 'm standing here at the prime of my life , ' she said			2
' i think this is my day			2
' @entity2 first had a go at this crossing back in 1978 , when she swam inside a steel shark cage for about 42 hours before sea currents hammering her off course put an end to that attempt			1
the following year she set a world record for open - water swimming without a shark cage , charting 102.5 miles ( 165 kilometers ) from the @entity105 to @entity5 , then retired from competitive endurance swimming			0
still , she said the aborted @entity4 attempt stuck with her all these years , and upon turning 60 , she started thinking about a comeback			0
' what if i went back and tried to chase that elusive dream of @entity4 ? ' she said			0
' and i started training and i found it was in my heart and it was in my body			0
... it seems almost like a dream to me , but now it 's real			0
' the sun sets as an assistance boat follows @entity2 on her grueling route the waters @entity2 will spend the next 60 hours in are shark infested in preparation she made 8 - to 15 - hour swims over the last two years off the @entity34 island of @entity126			1
@entity128 swimmer @entity127 successfully swam the shark - filled waters from @entity4 through the @entity131 and to the @entity132 in 1997 , though she used a cage			0
@entity2 's team is deploying an electronic boom to surround her with a current that is imperceptible to humans but is strong enough to keep most sharks at bay			1
whitetip sharks are not deterred by the field , so divers will be standing by to gently discourage any of those who get curious - without harming them			0
for the record to have been considered valid , @entity2 had to make the swim without a wetsuit			1
her crew were navigating , monitoring her health and providing nourishment			0
but she was not allowed to touch the boat , nor can her helpers hold her , until she emerges fully onto dry land			0
five support vessels carried 45 navigators , nutritionists , doctors , shark wranglers and a film crew that has been documenting her story			0
she planned to stop every 45 minutes for 20 - second hydration breaks - water , juice , sports drinks			0
every 90 minutes she 'd rest for two minutes and nibble on bread or a spoonful of peanut butter			0
by day two she was drinking heated water and hot chocolate to ward off hypothermia , a threat after so many hours at sea			0
@entity2 embarked on a northwest course aiming to arrive at a point in the @entity132 a little east of due north , compensating for sea currents			1
she called the attempt a ' symbolic moment ' for increasing understanding between the @entity17 and @entity4 , two nations torn by five decades of animosity and mistrust			0
' i 'm under no delusion that my swim is going to make any new political ramifications , ' @entity2 added			2
' but it is a human moment between the two countries			0

absolutely the right call , @entity2 said
