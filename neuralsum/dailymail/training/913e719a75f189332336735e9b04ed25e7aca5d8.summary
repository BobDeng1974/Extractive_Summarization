a man who matches the description of @entity3 's alleged rapist has set up a legal fund to defend his reputation and prepare for a law suit against the @entity8 creator , a report claims			1
ms @entity3 , 28 , dedicates a chapter of her book , @entity12 , to a ' flamboyant @entity14 conservative ' that she met at @entity15 in @entity16 identified as ' @entity17 ' , who she claims raped her after a party			1
subsequent reports found a man named @entity22 fits the description			2
after numerous failed attempts to get ms @entity3 to remove the passage or openly clear his name , one 's attorney @entity24 reveals a fund has been set up to gather costs to defend his reputation			1
a new media investigation claims there is no proof of the man she describes @entity24 told @entity43 : ' all proceeds will be spent by @entity17 on legal costs and related fees associated with defending @entity17 's reputation including , but not limited to , potentially pursuing @entity3 and @entity48 for harm caused to @entity17 's reputation from the publication and sale of ms @entity3 's memoir			1
' in ms @entity3 's memoir - for which she received a reported $ 3.7 million advance - the writer claims she drank alcohol then took @entity57 and cocaine before inviting @entity17 back to her on - campus apartment			1
but the encounter , she claims , quickly turned aggressive , and @entity17 twice removed the condom during intercourse without telling her			0
' i never gave permission to be rough , to stick himself inside me without a barrier between us , ' she wrote			0
' i never gave him permission			0
in my deepest self i know this , and the knowledge of it has kept me from sinking			0
' @entity3 's description of @entity17 is similarly explicit , explaining him as a ' mustachioed campus @entity14 ' with a ' mustache that rode the line between ironic @entity79 fashion and big buck hunter ' , who hosted a radio show called real talk with @entity84 , worked in the library stacking shelves and ' wore purple cowboy boots '			1
she also said that he once punched a girl ' in the boob ' at a party and , following a consensual sexual encounter , another girl woke to find blood spattered all over the wall ' like a crime scene '			0
scene : it is believed the rape @entity3 describes in her book took place at @entity15 in @entity16 ( pictured ) in the winter of 2005 following a party furthermore @entity3 does not state that ' @entity17 ' is a pseudonym , as she does with other names that appear in her book			1
although a @entity43 investigation found the character to be a ' ghost ' , articles by the @entity107 and @entity108 supported @entity22 's claim that he has a solid libel case against ms @entity3			1
in a statement , @entity22 's attorney said he has already spent two months worth of legal fees defending himself			1
he has been in contact with ms @entity3 's team since october 6 but ' despite multiple requests , ' the statement says , ' @entity3 has not issued any sort of statement clearing @entity17 's name and clarifying the confusion that is happening			1
' any proceeds not used on legal related costs , @entity24 said , will be donated to not - for - profit organizations that assist victims of rape and sexual assault , to be selected at a later date			0
an investigation by @entity134 from @entity135 undertaken at the @entity15 campus , which was published thursday , concluded that the ' @entity137 describes is a ' ghost ' , and that no such person appeared to exist at the college during the years she studied there			2
' in fact , we could not find anyone who remembered any @entity15 @entity14 who matched @entity3 's colorful description , ' @entity134 wrote			1
' under scrutiny , @entity3 's rape story did n't just fall apart , it evaporated into pixie dust and blew away			1
' the @entity43 report followed an attack on @entity3 by @entity152 's hard - right columnist @entity151 , who said she was ' grossly irresponsible ' for publishing the rape claim in the first place			1
@entity151 said he spoke to a @entity17 who was a prominent @entity14 that attended @entity15 and that has been hounded by the media since the release of @entity12 in september			2
this @entity17 told @entity151 he has never met @entity3 and did not have any kind of relationship with her			2
he said the fact his name is @entity17 and that he is a @entity14 who went to @entity15 is ' the ' most unfortunate coincidence of my life '			2
the man , who is married with kids , said he is petrified that his full name is going to be published			0
@entity151 then wrote of @entity3 : ' it is at the very least the deployment of weaponized celebrity without any concern for collateral damage			2
' i have my doubts about whether the encounter @entity3 describes actually happened at all ; in her memoir , she writes about presenting anecdotes from other people 's lives as her own			1
' but , for the record , the man to whom i spoke does not believe that @entity3 intended to refer to him			2
' the @entity43 investigation , which describes @entity3 as ' one of the most powerful and influential women in @entity184 ' , included the account of @entity151 's ' @entity17 '			1
it notes that friends of his laughed at the suggestion of him ever having a moustache and that other details given by @entity3 also did n't fit			1
@entity134 then goes in search of someone else that might fit the description			0
he deduces the alleged rape occurred in winter 2005			0
massive publicity tour : @entity3 meets fans and signs copies of her book ' @entity12 ' at @entity200 in @entity201 on october 29 , 2014 a search of the campus newspaper archives and @entity15 graduation announcements did not find any @entity17 - other than the one @entity151 spoke to - who graduated or attended @entity15 in 2005 , 2006 , or 2007			1
a further search of the campus for someone not named @entity17 but who fits the description given by @entity3 also showed no results			2
there was no proof of a radio show called @entity215 with @entity84 , he said			0
' nevertheless , no amount of digging could verify even a single detail of @entity3 's rape claim , ' @entity134 wrote			1
the report criticizes @entity3 for pointing the finger at this one @entity17 in such a public manner , as opposed to reporting what happened to her to the authorities			1
@entity3 has not responded to the @entity226 piece			2
calls to @entity48 , the publisher of @entity12 , and to @entity3 's literary agent made by @entity230 were not immediately returned on thursday			1
@entity3 did however react to @entity151 when his piece was published last month			2
she took to @entity232 to defend her story			0
love : @entity3 is seen here at the @entity234 with her boyfriend , musician @entity235 ' some men are enraged by stories of sexual assault that do n't have clear cut villains , pimps or men with guns , ' she wrote			1
' that 's because these stories force them to ask hard questions about their history with consent			0
' well , we all have to ask hard questions			0
grow the f --- up			0
' and i have some news for certain ' news ' outlets			0
no matter how much you thump your keyboards with your meat hands we will not stop talking			0
' this is not the only controversy to come from @entity3 's tome			2
the @entity35 native cancelled several appearances on her book tour after being accused of molesting her younger sister as a child			0
in one chapter of the book she describes how , as a seven - year - old , she experimented with her sister @entity270 , who was one at the time			0
' one day , as i sat in our driveway in @entity275 playing blocks and buckets , my curiosity got the better of me , ' @entity3 wrote			0
' @entity270 was sitting up , babbling smiling , and i leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina			0
' the accusations were mostly spearheaded by @entity151 , who said her behavior was child abuse			0
@entity3 came back swinging , writing on @entity232 : ' the right wing news story that i molested my little sister is n't just @entity287 - it 's really f --- ing upsetting and disgusting			1
family : @entity3 was accused of molesting her younger sister @entity270 ( pictured ) by two media outlets following a controversial chapter in her book , where she admits to experiment with her sibling as a child ' and by the way , if you were a little kid and never looked at another little kid 's vagina , well , congrats to you			1
' usually this is stuff i can ignore but do n't demean sufferers , do n't twist my words , ' i told a story about being a weird 7 year old			0
i bet you have some too , old men , that i 'd rather not hear			0
' and yes , this is a rage spiral			0
