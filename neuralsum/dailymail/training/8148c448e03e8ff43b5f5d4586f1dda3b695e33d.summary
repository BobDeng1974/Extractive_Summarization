@entity0 admits he is relishing the prospect of building a relationship with fellow @entity3 forward @entity5			1
the summer arrivals have looked like a well - established partnership in their last two games for the @entity3 , both getting amongst the goals in the draw at @entity11 and saturday 's impressive 3 - 1 victory over @entity13			1
@entity0 , 24 , joined from @entity14 having led the scoring charts for the @entity17 outfit as they gained promotion to @entity19 and has since scored three goals in three starts for @entity3			1
@entity0 celebrates with strike partner @entity5 after scoring in @entity3 's 3 - 1 win over @entity13 his goal on saturday came after @entity27 's opener as he deftly lofted the ball over stranded @entity13 goalkeeper @entity29 and , whilst confirming he meant the audacious effort , the @entity23 international is ready to work on his blossoming understanding with @entity32			1
' i saw the ' keeper off his line , at the near post , and i only had one thing in mind , ' he told @entity39			0
' i tried it and it came off			0
i was n't sure if it was going to go in or not , but thankfully it 's ended up in the net			2
i 'm pleased , pleased for me and for the team			0
i 've dreamed of scoring a goal as good as that , particularly here at the @entity49			2
' @entity0 , chipped in a sublime goal against @entity13 on saturday , has become an instant hit at @entity3 regarding @entity32 , he added : ' we 've trained together for a short while now			1
@entity5 's a footballer who likes to get it down and play , and me , i like to come deep			1
i try to position myself in relation to him and vice-versa			0
i hope that 's going to continue to serve the club well this season			2
' we 're working every day in training for that			0
we 're not going to relax and we 'll carry on working hard at it , because it 's only the beginning of the season and there will be plenty of matches to play together			2
' @entity3 boss @entity69 believes @entity0 has benefited from the spotlight being drawn by the big - money signing of @entity32 , who starred at the @entity73 for @entity74			1
@entity0 competes with his namesake and @entity13 defender @entity76 during the clash at @entity49 the duo will both be licking their lips at the prospect of coming up against @entity83 's shaky defence on saturday but , even if the goals start to dry up for @entity0 , he is ready to do his bit for the team as @entity3 look to build on their win over @entity13			1
' goals are why i 'm here and that 's why @entity3 signed me , ' he added			1
' but beyond that i 'll try to help the team , as much as i possibly can			0
and even if i do n't score , as long as i 'm useful , that 's the important thing			0
i work every day in training to try to be as effective as possible			0
' we deserved it ( the result against @entity13 )			2
on the whole , we lived up to manager 's expectations and those of the staff			0
and if we continue to play like that , work together , united as a group , we 'll do good things in the @entity107			0

@entity0 scored in @entity3 's 3 - 1 win over @entity13 at @entity49
@entity3 new signing has now scored three goals in four games
