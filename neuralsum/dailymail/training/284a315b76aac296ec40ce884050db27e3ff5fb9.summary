by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 is facing humiliation in @entity4 , as @entity5 prepares to hand @entity6 a junior commissioner role			1
a leaked document reveals @entity10 president @entity9 plans to give @entity12 peer @entity11 brief			0
@entity14 scrabbled to insist this would still be considered an economic brief , but is far from the heavyweight role mr @entity2 hoped for and would see @entity18 serving under @entity20 @entity19			1
@entity2 tried to block @entity22 's appointment as @entity10 president , and now faces the paying the price by @entity6 being given a low rank job mr @entity2 caused a major political row this summer when he tried to block mr @entity9 ’s appointment			1
the prime minister pushed the decision to a vote of all @entity32 leaders , and lost after only attracting the support of @entity34			0
mr @entity9 then warned mr @entity2 to send a woman to @entity4 or risk @entity6 forfeiting a top role at the @entity10			1
but the @entity20 instead chose @entity18 , a former @entity12 education minister who was sitting in the @entity37 as @entity38			2
his role in @entity5 could be key to mr @entity2 ’s hopes of securing major reform of the @entity32 , before @entity6 holds an in - out referendum in 2017			1
it now appeared that @entity6 could be punished for the decision , after it emerged the big economic roles look set to go to other countries			1
each @entity32 member state nominates a candidate to become a @entity4 commissioner , but as president mr @entity9 decides which areas they will have responsibilities for			0
the last @entity6 commissioner , @entity54 , held the prestigious foreign affairs brief			2
but according to a report on the @entity58 website , @entity6 will be left with the @entity11 brief this time round			2
in contrast @entity60 is in line for the powerful competition commissioner , a key area for mr @entity2 ’s hopes of overhauling @entity5 ’ powers			2
lord @entity18 had insisted three weeks ago that he did not want the @entity68 job , but weeks later mr @entity2 put his name forward the list has not been finalised , and could yet be open to negotiation			1
in an attempt to put a brave face on the issue , mr @entity2 's official spokesman today insisted that some commentators had considered the energy role to be an economic brief			2
' when the prime minister met the president of the commission @entity9 he made the case for an economic portfolio for the incoming @entity6 commissioner and that has n’t changed , ' the spokesman added			2
lord @entity18 was a surprise choice for the role , after more high profile figures including ex-ministers @entity90 and @entity92 were tipped for the job			1
other countries appear to have responded to the plea for more women in key roles			0
@entity98 has chosen @entity99 as its candidate			0
@entity98 was the last of the @entity32 's 28 @entity32 members to put forward its choice for commissioner , a result of continuing uncertainty on a new coalition government			0
the @entity108 has warned that it might not confirm @entity9 's 28 - strong team if it contained fewer women than the outgoing @entity10 , which has nine			0
lord @entity18 's nomination attracted ridicule coming days after he ruled himself out for the role			1
asked if he wanted to go to @entity5 , he told the conservative home website : ' non , non , non			0
‘ first , i do n't believe i 'm going to be asked			0
secondly , i like it here			0
i quite like it at home , in the @entity118			0
' in a separate interview with @entity120 , @entity18 also confessed : ‘ i am not very good at thinking long term			0
’ yet his role in @entity5 could be key to mr @entity2 ’s hopes of securing major reform of the @entity32 , before @entity6 holds an in - out referendum in 2017			1
it was not the first time the @entity20 appears to have ignored the peer			0
in 2012 , he secured a meeting with the @entity20 to tender his resignation			0
but instead of accepting – or protesting – lord @entity18 ’s decision , mr @entity2 reportedly told him to carry on his good work , and strode out of the room after being told he was late for a photocall			1
as a result , lord @entity18 remained in post			1
lord @entity18 worked in the @entity138 and as special adviser to @entity140 in the 1980s and served in the @entity141 1991 - 2 and as political secretary to prime minister @entity143 .			1
