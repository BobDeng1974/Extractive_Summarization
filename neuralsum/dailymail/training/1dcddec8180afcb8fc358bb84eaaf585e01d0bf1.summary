path of blood by @entity1 and @entity2 ( @entity3 £ 18			2
i do not know a single person who is not appalled and frightened in equal measure by the spread of @entity14 fanaticism , especially the seemingly unstoppable rise of the ragbag gang of murderers known as @entity18 ( @entity19 )			1
in addition it makes most of us rage as well as weep that young people who have known all the advantages of living in @entity26 ( and make no mistake , there are many , no matter how much victimhood - type whinging goes on ) should head off to a pitiless desert in the hope of building a so - called ‘ @entity32 ’			2
oh , and of course , being permitted to have sex with those 72 legendary virgins in paradise — once glorious martyrdom is achieved through murdering ‘ kuffars ’			2
@entity40 ( his adopted name ) and his father @entity42 , who shot and killed the leader of the @entity44 in @entity45 on one level it is pathetic , absurd			1
on another , truly repulsive			2
we may loathe and fear this mind - set , yet we must still seek to be informed about it			2
( i hesitate to use the word , ‘ understand ’ since that seems a step too far			0
) you have to know the enemy in order to wage war – — and is there any doubt that this is war ? that ’s why these two timely books are — each in a different way — essential reading			1
one is a short account of how the son of a terrorist has eschewed his father and now devotes his life to preaching an alternative message			1
the other provides a lucid and vividly written background that reveals much about the @entity14 terrorist mind - set			1
when @entity40 ( his adopted name ) was just seven , his father , @entity42 , shot and killed the leader of the @entity44 in @entity45			1
@entity77 began to ‘ pore endlessly over the @entity80 ’ and attended ‘ mysterious meetings ’ and became withdrawn from his family on november 5 , 1990 the little boy in @entity82 experienced the end of his childhood			0
his father ‘ was the first known @entity14 jihadist to take life on @entity88 soil ’ , and worked with the support of a terror cell overseas that would ultimately call itself @entity92			1
@entity40 ’s mother was a @entity94 who lost her faith , found @entity14 — and very quickly married an @entity98 immigrant to whom she had spoken about two words			1
the couple were ‘ happy for a time ’ , and even though he has repudiated his father , @entity40 does have some joyful memories of time with him			1
for @entity77 began to ‘ pore endlessly over the @entity80 ’ and attended ‘ mysterious meetings ’ and became withdrawn from his family			0
this pattern is one we have read about again and again , when muslims are ‘ radicalised ’			0
after @entity42 ’s incarceration , @entity40 ’s family moved more than 20 times , and the children were bullied mercilessly at school for their father ’s notoriety			1
but life was to become far worse			0
@entity40 ’s mother had always believed in her husband ’s innocence — until after the explosion in the underground car park of the @entity122 in 1993 , which killed six innocent people , including a pregnant woman			1
it emerged that @entity126 was one of those who had organised this , from his prison cell			0
astounded and repelled , his hitherto gullible wife sought a divorce			0
after a deeply unhappy adolescence , @entity40 found a job at a theme park in @entity136 where the racial and religious diversity of the visitors opened his eyes to a world of tolerance			1
‘ from the moment i put on my @entity145 safari suit , i meet tourists and co-workers of every description , which is so liberating that i can hardly put the feeling into words , ’ he writes			0
in one of his infamous video messages , @entity151 urged his followers to ‘ remember @entity42 ’			1
@entity42 ’s adult son has done just that , but not in the way that brainwashed jihadis would like			1
his choice has been to turn his back on the extremism that might have been his legacy and argue against it in public			0
turning someone into a bigot is the first step in turning him into a terrorist			0
you find someone vulnerable — someone who ’s lost his confidence , his income , his pride , his agency			1
someone who feels humiliated by life			0
you fill him with fear and fury , and you see to it that he regards anybody who ’s different as a faceless target			1
’ a children of @entity92 extremist totes a gun now , @entity40 acts as a brave and inspiring ambassador for reason , tolerance and choice			1
you only wish he could visit every school in @entity190 - dominated areas of this country and ‘ offer myself up as proof that it is possible to shut one ’s ears to hatred and violence and simply choose peace ’			2
of @entity77 he says simply : ‘ he chose terrorism over fatherhood			0
my father chose terrorism over me			0
’ another important book in today ’s climate is @entity206 , subtitled , the story of @entity92 ’s @entity207			2
in taking us back to @entity151 ’s aim to conquer his home country , @entity212 , it throws invaluable light on the current situation in @entity215 and @entity216			2
the schisms and divisions within @entity14 can be confusing for the general reader , but with its glossary and ‘ cast - list ’ , path of blood serves to clarify history in the making			1
@entity228 urrently there are 10,000 foreign fighters in @entity216 , many affiliated with @entity92 — which , do not forget , denounced the extremism of @entity19			0
but like @entity19 , @entity92 was able to lure impressionable young men by a mixture of religious rhetoric and a promise of fleshpots in heaven			2
the authors tell a vivid story of how a campaign of kidnappings , shootings and bombings was launched across @entity212 and how the royal family fought back			0
the book is a salutary reminder of how pitifully undisciplined , fragmented and lacking in intelligence and expertise the terrorists were — yet at the same time how ruthless and dangerous			0
for example , a skilled bomb - maker had no compunction about turning his pitiful special – needs brother into a suicide bomber in an attempt to assassinate @entity259 of the @entity212 royal family			0
next year a film with the same title will be released , drawing on extensive research , interviews and video footage captured from @entity92 safe houses — all material which is in this book			0
most important , for me , was the insight gained into the workings of @entity212 society , and the realisation that the country ’s on - going role in ‘ the war on terror ’ has not been fully understood			2
whatever we may think of their authoritarian , conservative and patriarchal customs , we need the @entity280 on our side .			0
