this is the moment murderer @entity0 told police that he had run over and hacked to death @entity3 ' by @entity6 's decree '			1
the chilling video can be shown for the first time today after an @entity10 jury took just 90 minutes to find @entity0 and accomplice @entity11 guilty of murdering the father - of - one and the attempted murder of police			1
the disturbing footage shows the 28 - year - old extremist wrapped in a blanket with a copy of the @entity19 in front of him , offering no emotion or remorse for his terrible crime			2
instead he coldly explained to officers that the @entity28 died just because ' he was the soldier that was spotted first ' in @entity30 on may 22 this year			1
' we decided to wait in the vicinity of the barracks that is in @entity30 , ' he said			0
testimony : @entity0 said he loved @entity47 and said its members were his ' brothers ' ' by the command of @entity6 , by @entity6 's decree , whilst waiting to find a soldier because between us we decided that the soldier is the most fair target because he joins the @entity40 with kind of an understanding that your life is at risk when you join , you know			1
' so we sat in wait and it just so happened that he was the soldier that was spotted first '			2
@entity0 had just been released from hospital after a week of lifesaving treatment , having charged police swinging a meat cleaver before before being shot by armed officers			1
the interview from june 1 , played to the court , shows @entity42 born @entity0 has adopted an accent , although from time to time he slips back into his @entity75 accent			1
‘ when i thought about obeying @entity6 in the past i thought maybe it is possible to kill a man by driving into him , ’ he said			2
‘ when he crossed the road in front of me so casually it was almost as if i was not in control of myself			0
i accelerated , i hit him and i think i also crashed into a sign post			0
’ cold - blooded : @entity11 , 22 , of @entity87 , south - east @entity75 , with a knife in his hand after he had hacked @entity3 to death he went on : ‘ we did not wish to give him much pain - i could see he was still alive			1
we exited the vehicle and i am not sure how i struck the first blow			0
‘ the most humane way to kill any creature is to cut the jugular , this is what i believe , this is how we kill our animals in @entity101			0
he may be my enemy but he is a man - so i struck at the neck and attempted to remove his head			0
’ he said he thought @entity104 was the ‘ non-muslim version of myself and my brother @entity106 ] ’ , adding : ‘ to be killed on the battlefield is not something we shy away from and in fact this is something that @entity6 loves			1
’ ' brutal ' : the two men accused of the murder of fusilier @entity3 , @entity0 ( right ) and @entity11 ( second right ) hacked at @entity3 like ' he was a tree ' , witnesses said earlier in the video , @entity0 insisted that the alleged killing was not ‘ a personal vendetta ’ , and said he would like to speak to the dead soldier ’s family			1
‘ i have never met the family of @entity3 ’ , he said			2
‘ quite possibly i may have walked past one of them in the street			0
i do not hate them			0
i do not hate them , nor does my brother @entity106 , he does not			0
this is not a personal vendetta			0
’ @entity0 appeared to break down for a few seconds as he recalled the events and muttered : ‘ forgive me , ok '			2
