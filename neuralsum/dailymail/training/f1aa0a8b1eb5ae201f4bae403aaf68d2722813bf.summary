@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 were among the stars snubbed at this year 's @entity5 nominations			1
@entity0 had admitted just hours prior to the announcement that she was hoping to be asleep when the @entity8 nods were announced , and hopefully that was the case because she did not receive her first @entity11 nod for her role in @entity13			1
the 45 - year - old actress had received nominations at the @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 but sadly it was n't enough for the @entity5			2
' i 'm not going to torture myself , ' @entity0 told @entity30 news			0
' i 'll be in bed			0
i 'll be in bed with my beloved and my dogs dreaming wild little dreams			0
' @entity2 actually won the @entity16 for her @entity11 performance in @entity38 's @entity24 on sunday night but she was , rather surprisingly , not recognised this year			2
recognised : @entity0 and @entity2 were nominated for @entity11 at the @entity16 but the later won the award on sunday no to unbroken : @entity1 's wartime epic did not pick up a @entity42 nomination or a best director for the actress @entity2 had been nominated five times at the @entity5 ; once for best actress and four times for @entity48			1
instead @entity49 , ( two days , one night ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , and @entity56 ( @entity57 ) are up for the highly - coveted prize			0
@entity1 was also overlooked in both the @entity59 and @entity42 category for her wartime epic unbroken			1
based on the harrowing but inspiring story of @entity63 turned @entity65 prisoner @entity64 , @entity66 seemed set to become an awards season frontrunner but it has been overlooked across the board apart from in the more technical categories			2
surprise : based on the harrowing but inspiring story of @entity63 turned @entity65 prisoner @entity64 , it was thought @entity66 would be an awards frontrunner she was n't the only female director to be snubbed as @entity76 's @entity75 did not get recognised for her work on the civil rights period film			1
the shortlist was all male featuring @entity82 ( birdman ) , @entity84 ( @entity85 ) , @entity86 ( @entity87 ) @entity88 ( @entity89 ) and @entity90 ( @entity91 )			1
also missing from the list were the four time @entity8 - nominated and twice - winning actor / director @entity93 for @entity94 , as well as @entity95 for his epic @entity97			1
it 's a shock for most film - lovers to see the sci - fi blockbuster and @entity66 missing from the @entity42 shortlist , considering there are 10 spots in the field and only eight filled			1
another year for @entity105 : @entity106 did not get a @entity48 nomination for her turn in @entity109 missed out : @entity110 and @entity111 had been celebrated for their performances in @entity114 but neither received nods in the best actor or @entity48 categories elsewhere , @entity118 did not receive a @entity48 nomination for her turn in @entity109 but @entity120 picked up her first ever @entity8 nomination in the same category			1
@entity110 , @entity125 and @entity111 had been celebrated for their performances in @entity114 but not one of them received a nod in the best actor , @entity124 or best supporting actress categories			1
same goes for @entity133 actor @entity132 , who won the @entity134 at last year 's @entity135 for his role as the titular character in mr. @entity138 , but failed to secure a nod at the @entity5 or the @entity140			2
not the @entity5 's cup of tea : @entity133 actor @entity132 won the @entity134 at last year 's @entity135 for his role as the title character in mr. @entity138 but failed to secure a nod at the @entity5 or the @entity140 @entity42 @entity94 birdman boyhood the @entity89 the @entity148 @entity76 the @entity149 whiplash best actress @entity49 , two days one night @entity50 , @entity51 @entity52 , @entity152 @entity54 , @entity55 @entity56 , @entity57 best supporting actress @entity154 , @entity85 @entity155 , @entity57 @entity156 , @entity91 @entity120 , @entity157 @entity158 , @entity159 @entity160 @entity161 @entity162 @entity163 @entity164 @entity165 @entity166 birdman boyhood @entity87 the @entity89 @entity114 @entity169 the @entity89 the @entity148 interstellar mr. @entity138 the @entity149 best @entity171 @entity172 the @entity173 @entity174 @entity175 the tale of princess @entity177 @entity178 @entity94 boyhood the @entity89 the @entity148 whiplash @entity181 the bigger picture the @entity183 feast me and my @entity186 a single life @entity188 @entity94 birdman the @entity190 : @entity191 interstellar unbroken @entity193 @entity94 birdman interstellar unbroken whiplash @entity197 — feature @entity199 finding @entity200 last days of @entity201 the @entity202 @entity203 best director @entity205 , @entity157 @entity84 , @entity85 @entity86 , @entity87 @entity88 , @entity89 @entity90 , @entity91 best actor @entity207 , @entity87 @entity208 , @entity209 sniper @entity210 , @entity91 @entity211 , @entity157 @entity212 , @entity51 best supporting actor @entity214 , @entity215 @entity216 , @entity85 @entity217 , @entity157 @entity218 , @entity87 @entity219 , @entity220 @entity221 birdman – @entity223 the @entity89 – @entity224 @entity161 – @entity225 & @entity226 mr. @entity138 – @entity227 unbroken – @entity228 @entity229 @entity94 the @entity148 inherent vice the @entity149 whiplash @entity232 @entity87 the @entity89 @entity233 @entity234 ' @entity235 , ' @entity236 ' @entity237 , ' the @entity238 ' glory , ' @entity76 ' @entity240 , ' beyond the lights ' i 'm not gon na @entity244 , ' @entity242 … i 'll be me @entity197 — short crisis hotline : @entity246 1 @entity247 our curse the @entity250 @entity251 @entity252 the @entity89 the @entity148 interstellar @entity159 mr. @entity138 @entity254 @entity255 @entity256 and @entity257 @entity258 @entity259 the phone call best visual effects @entity262 : the winter soldier @entity264 @entity233 interstellar x-men : @entity266 @entity267 the @entity89 inherent vice @entity159 @entity269 mr. @entity138 @entity133 actor @entity270 will not be practicing his speech making for the @entity5 either after his turn as @entity273 in @entity76 was not recognised in the @entity275 category			1
