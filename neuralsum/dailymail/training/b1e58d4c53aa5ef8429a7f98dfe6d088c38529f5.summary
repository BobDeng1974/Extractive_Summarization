although @entity6 should have been sent to prison for breaching the terms of his sentence , a judge said jailing him would ‘ ruin his life ’ and freed him			1
free : a judge spared @entity6 , right , a jail term so he would be free to marry long - term partner @entity19 , left , despite a vicious and unprovoked attack on two students judge @entity22 , sitting at @entity21 , handed @entity6 a six - week home curfew , ending in time for his big day and honeymoon to @entity25 next month			1
the judge said : ‘ it would destroy your life in the short term if i was to imprison you immediately – you would not be able to attend your wedding			1
’ @entity6 , who the court heard had also failed to complete the community service element of his sentence , is due to marry his long - standing girlfriend , @entity19 , 39 , on june 24			1
the couple , who have two children together , had already paid a ‘ large amount ’ towards the ceremony and are due to go on an 11 - day honeymoon on june 29			1

they stopped at a takeaway on their way home , when , at around 4am , they were attacked by @entity6 , who had been drinking			0
‘ they were in the takeaway , sitting waiting , when a man they did n’t know , the defendant , approached mr @entity42 , ’ mr @entity39 said			0
‘ he [ @entity6 ] said something to him , which he could n’t recall , grabbed him by the shoulders , then punched him to the face , causing a swollen lip			2
‘ the incident was captured on @entity61 , which shows @entity6 punching him in the mouth without provocation , and then he attempts to hit him again , but misses and hits mr @entity44			2
’ police were called to the scene and arrested @entity6 , who was carrying half a gram of cocaine			2
when questioned , @entity6 claimed the students had been guilty of ‘ offensive behaviour ’ earlier in the evening			2

’ mr @entity44 , who later made a claim for compensation , told police he suffered bruising and pain down the side of his face for three days after the attack , and back pain			0

in 2008 , @entity6 was cautioned for possession of a @entity89 drug and , in august last year , he received a 12 - month jail sentence , suspended for 12 months , for producing a @entity98 drug after police discovered a cannabis factory in @entity101			1
smirking : judge @entity22 ruled that if he imprisoned @entity6 , right , causing the postponement of his wedding to @entity19 , left , it would ' destroy ' his life in the short term @entity6 claimed he had set up the factory , which included 91 plants and 35 seedlings , because he owed money to drug dealers			1
@entity113 , defending , said @entity6 assaulted the students because he thought they were among a group of young men he had seen ‘ bullying ’ a young girl earlier in the evening			2
however , he later admitted being high on drink and cocaine and that it could have been a case of mistaken identity			2
mr @entity113 said @entity6 was trying to find work as a labourer , but that he had not completed unpaid work , part of his previous sentence , because of a bad knee injury			0

he added : ‘ we both feared the worst and @entity19 has been a nervous wreck			0
i was so sure i would n’t be going on the honeymoon i told her to look at taking a friend			0

@entity6 was serving 12 - month suspended sentence for growing a cannabis farm when he *launched* vicious attack .
the 40 - year - old *'s* defence pleads that ‘ drink and cocaine ' were probably a reason for his *aggression*
judge takes pity on the thug because making him postpone wedding ' would destroy ' his life in the short term
sentence allows him to attend wedding and enjoy 11 - day honeymoon
father - of - two @entity6 admitted two offences of assault by beating and possession of cocaine
