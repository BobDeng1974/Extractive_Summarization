by @entity0 published : 15:11 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:12 est , 28 february 2014 @entity3 and her husband @entity4 admitted buying £ 160,000 worth of printer cartridges before selling them on @entity9 a @entity11 administrator who bought £ 160,000 of printer cartridges with public money before selling them on @entity9 was jailed today			1
@entity3 , 47 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , spent years defrauding her own department by ordering printer cartridges and selling them online			1
the £ 160,000 she and her husband @entity4 , 46 , took from the @entity11 would have funded six full - time nursing posts , a court heard			1
the couple made around a £ 90,000 profit from the sales - using the money to fund holidays and buy luxurious items			1
@entity28 was sentenced to 26 months in jail and her husband 13 months at @entity5			1
the court heard how @entity28 , who was based in @entity33 had worked for the @entity11 for 22 years			2
@entity34 , prosecuting , told the court how her plot was uncovered ' quite by chance ' when she sent an email to friend and colleague @entity41 which linked to her @entity9 account			1
her account contained a lot of references to printer ink cartridges being sold and positive feedback from buyers			1
mr @entity34 , said : ' having seen those references ms @entity41 became concerned because she could recall several occasions when there had been a lot of ink cartridges at their office which had either not been required or had been placed for use in printers they did not even have			2
' @entity28 's boss @entity60 also recalled occasions she had been working late and saw @entity3 and her husband @entity4 , 46 , removing items from the office via the fire door			1
mr @entity34 , said : ' when asked about what was happening at the time she 'd given accounts about correcting mistaken deliveries and the like herself , to minimise inconvenience to others			0
' mrs @entity72 had taken that to be commendable and beyond the call of duty			0
with hindsight those incidents take on a very different presentation			0
' an investigation was launched			0
it was found that before @entity28 took over ordering ink cartridges the department spent about £ 2,500 a year			2
after it became her responsibility , the bill rocketed to £ 10,854 in 2008 to 2009 , then to more than £ 27,000 , £ 45,000 and finally £ 60,000 in the following years			2
mr @entity34 said the total cost of the cartridges ordered came to £ 168,420 - although some of that figure would have been spent on legitimate use			1
he said the loss to the @entity11 amounted to between £ 155,000 and £ 160,000 - roughly six times her salary			1
in terms of profit generated through @entity9 and cash payments , she made a total of £ 90,318			1
@entity28 used the money to pay for foreign holidays including trips via @entity101 and @entity102 , as well as being spent on shopping channels , eating out , bingo and bookmakers			2
when arrested she tried to talk her way out of it , saying that she had a contact in @entity109 who built up a stockpile of printers which she then sold on but she had lost contact with her			2
mrs @entity3 was jailed for 23 months while her husband for 13 months today			1
the court heard how the money they spent on the cartridges could have paid for six full - time nursing posts she also suggested that problems with the @entity11 orders were down to the mistakes of receptionists or computer errors , and others may have had access to her accounts , which were all lies			1
@entity28 later pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position and her husband , who admitted taking nearly £ 100,000 of pounds worth of cartridges to a customer in @entity135 , pleaded guilty to possessing criminal property			1
@entity137 , defending @entity28 , said it was a sad but inevitable given her dishonest behaviour			0
he added : ' she finds it difficult to come to terms with the amount of money that 's been spoken of in this case			2
her lifestyle has n't been changed as a result of this offending behaviour			0
' @entity148 , defending @entity28 , said he had lost his career as an account manager , was ' ashamed and remorseful ' and had only got involved to ' placate his wife and keep their marriage alive '			0
he added : ' the family may never recover from this offending			0
' judge @entity156 sentenced @entity28 to 26 months in jail and @entity28 to 13 months			2
he said : ' you and your wife have fallen from a great height			0
greed must have been the driving force for your offending			0
your combined yearly income would have been of a level many many people could only dream of and yet they , unlike you , do not commit the type of crimes which you did			0
' he added : ' you abused your position of trust within the @entity11			0
you did so repeatedly and over a long period of time			0
' you knew from your time within the @entity11 that at the time you were committing offences the service was under financial pressure			0
i can not say any particular front line health service was adversely affected by your actions but it will have put pressure on an already hard pressed service			0
