clasping a stranger 's hand in the basement of a derelict old mansion , the lights fizzle , go out — the room is plunged into darkness			0
i am on the @entity8 , a brand new experience for this year 's @entity11 extravaganza , which promises to petrify punters until 3am every night			1
as well as the usual @entity14 and zombie - filled scare zones strewn across the park , brave souls can sign up to the full overnight experience			1
towers of terror : @entity20 is being haunted by a few frankly unpleasant characters for @entity11 which is how i find myself standing around a bonfire , in the abandoned theme park at 8pm on a cold autumn night ( not feeling particularly brave )			1
the evening starts off well enough with a two - course buffet meal around a bonfire in the park 's gardens			1
do come and join us : a cast of ghastly ghouls and ghostly figures has been assembled for @entity34 the expert team , led by ghost hunter extraordinaire @entity35 and his daughter @entity36 , tell tales of spooks who haunt the premises and ghostly goings on in the grounds			1
then we are escorted to the house			0
the first part of the night takes place in the crypts of the mansion , where the team try to summon some spirits			2
we stand in the darkness , holding hands , instructed not to break the circle - the only sound i can hear is my heart racing			2
not so creature comfortable : guests staying over for @entity34 can look forward to suitably scary lodging as we move to the basement the story of the haunting of the house unfolds , and strange things start to happen			1
@entity36 cries quietly in the corner , the cup on the table starts to move , and @entity35 admits that things have got a bit out of control			0
there 's no rest , either			0
we are led to a dormitory of camp beds and a night of terror ensues			2
until 3am we are haunted , harassed and dragged from our beds by our hosts who have been possessed by the very spirits they were trying to raise ( or so it goes )			0
all aglow : the park takes on a different atmosphere after dark , when most of the crowds have gone home in the morning , somewhat weary , we are woken again for breakfast before being sent off to enjoy a day in the park			0
@entity34 has a certification - you have to be over 16			1
and it should add another - not for the faint - hearted			0
@entity34 at @entity20 ( 0871 222 3330 , www.altontowers.com ) runs until november 2			2
the @entity8 starts from £ 240 per person , and from £ 200 per person when booking a group of six people or more			0
this includes breakfast , two - day theme park entry , one - day scare maze ticket , two - course buffet meal and car parking .			1

the @entity103 theme park has *embraced* the ghostly for @entity11
brave *customers* can *opt* to stay the night - but may not get much sleep
@entity34 involves a ' ghost hunt ' in the old property at the core of the park
