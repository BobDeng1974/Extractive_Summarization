a photographer from @entity1 , @entity2 , has released a series of images of her friend 's c - section in the hopes of demonstrating to the world that the taboo procedure can be a ' peaceful and joyful ' experience for both mother and baby			1
while @entity13 , who specializes in maternity photography , had previously documented two natural births , she had never before been given an opportunity to capture a @entity17			1
so when her friend @entity18 asked whether she - and her camera - would be present in the delivery room , @entity13 leapt at the chance			1
it was , she says , an unforgettable experience			0
bouncing baby boy : @entity13 hopes that her photographs will show a different side to c - sections ' it was very special ' : while she has previously had the opportunity to document two natural births , this was the first c - section that @entity13 had witnessed mother and child : @entity18 could n't wait to meet her newborn son @entity33 ' i could not take my eyes off the surgery site , ' she told the @entity37			1
' there were moments where i almost forgot to take pictures , because i was so caught up in the amazingness of it all			0
' i 've never witnessed any kind of surgery , and this has got to be the best kind out there , so it was very special			0
' the photographer captured every aspect of the birth from the procedure itself right up until the moment when @entity18 and her family were first introduced to the newborn baby boy , named @entity33			1
and while she has had plenty of experience in the delivery room in the past - both during the births of her own two children and while photographing the births of others - the mother - of - two confessed she knew next to nothing about the reality of the c - section procedure before observing @entity18 's surgery			2
' c - sections are beautiful ' : the photographer was captivated by every aspect of the procedure breaking the taboo : @entity13 hopes that women everywhere will realize that c - sections are not necessarily something to be feared @entity76 : mother and son are both doing incredibly well following the procedure @entity13 admits that the experience enabled her to see a completely new side to the procedure and she is eager to demonstrate that c - sections are not always the scary and painful nightmares that they are often described as			1
' most women find themselves with a c - section delivery after not being able to progress with a vaginal delivery , and of course that does bring fear , ' she said			0

i 'd tell them to greet their baby as they would have if the birth plan had gone exactly the way they had envisioned it			2
' c - sections are beautiful too			0
it is still a family , meeting their baby , it â€™s a miracle			0
