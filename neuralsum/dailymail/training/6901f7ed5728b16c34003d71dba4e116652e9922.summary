a nursing assistant who strangled and buried eight of her newborn babies will be tried in @entity3 four years after she admitted the country 's worst ever infanticide case			1

' she has admitted giving birth in secret and then suffocating the babies and disposing of the bodies			0

' she was a good , loving grandmother , and we were happy to leave our children with her			0
' @entity104 : the second house where six more corpses were discovered			0
the case is thought to be @entity3 's worst tributes : candles were laid in front of the house where the newborns ' remains were found in northern @entity3 the tragedy is not the first such case in @entity3			1
