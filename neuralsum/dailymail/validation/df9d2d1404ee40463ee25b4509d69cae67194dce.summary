hundreds of hens who lay unique pastel - colored eggs have been stolen from a family 's farm just weeks before @entity6			1
@entity7 , who hand - raised the chickens on @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , said he has been left emotionally and financially devastated by the loss - which he predicts will cost him around $ 22,000			1
' i miss my birds , ' he told the @entity15			2
' they 're so beautiful ! ' @entity7 , who runs the farm with his wife and their two young sons , said he first noticed about half of his 600 to 700 ' @entity22 ' hens were missing after returning to work following a brief illness			1
the targeted hens are known for laying colorful eggs which are particularly in demand around @entity6 special : the ' @entity22 ' chickens lay pink , blue , green and cream eggs ( pictured ) but owner @entity7 said his family is now collecting just half of the eggs they would expect to have right now he told @entity37 that the birds apparently vanished overnight from their coop , which he had always left closed but unlocked until the theft			1
it came just days after he noticed the coop was wide open and that some of the birds were outside , so he told his sons , aged 11 and 13 , to make sure they secured the door behind them			2
' for someone to come in and do that is a violation			0
it 's a huge violation , ' he told @entity37			0
' i 'm angry they 're taking the food right out of my family 's mouth , but i ca n't carry that anger			0
' he believes someone who knows the farm and knows chickens could be responsible , and that too many chickens have disappeared for an animal to be responsible , the @entity15 reported			2
heartbroken : @entity7 , pictured , runs the @entity10 farm with his wife , sons and brother - in - law and said he is emotionally and financially devastated by the disappearance of the chickens loved : he said he misses his beautiful @entity22 chickens , all of whom he hand - reared from birth @entity7 , who started the business a few years ago , said he is down around $ 75 a day in earnings from eggs and about $ 100 invested in each chicken , for a total of more than $ 22,000			1
@entity22 are a mix of different breeds			2
their eggs may be blue , green , pink , brown , olive or cream			1
each hen will give lay just one egg color - they do not each lay a variety			0
egg colors occur when pigments are deposited as an egg moves through the hen 's oviduct			0
the exact color then hen will lay is determined by their genetics			0
for example , some breeds lay only white eggs ( @entity99 ) or brown eggs ( @entity101 ) , while others lay more colorful eggs			2
an @entity104 lays green eggs because it is the result of cross breeding between brown - and blue - laying chickens			1
likewise , because @entity22 are a hybrid breed , a coop will lay a mixture of colors			1
quite often the color of the chicken 's earlobe ( the flappy piece of skin at the side of their heads ) will indicate the colors of their eggs			0
if a chicken has white earlobes , it will likely lay white eggs , while if the earlobe is pink , the eggs will likely be non-white			1
despite the different colors on the shell , the eggs inside are the same and there are no major differences in flavor			0
instead , flavor is determined by the chicken 's diet			0
@entity22 are kept for their eggs but are not large enough to be used for meat			1
the birds , which he and his family incubated inside their home before hand - rearing , are a mixture of heritage and standard breeds , which allows for their colorful eggs			1
the demand for the eggs , which are blue , pink , grey , green and olive , is particularly high ahead of @entity6 , now less that two weeks away , the family said			1
@entity7 explained they should be collecting around 30 dozen eggs a day , and would expect to be getting as many as 50 dozen a day in a month - but right now they 're only collected 21 dozen			1
' alas , someone else will reap the benefit of our time , money and efforts , ' he wrote on @entity168 as he appealed for friends and customers to share his story			0
but he added that they are committed to rebuilding their business and is offering a $ 250 reward for information leading to their return			2
in the meantime , he is padlocking the birds ' enclosure and asking friends and neighbors to be on the lookout for anyone with new colorful eggs in the area			2
' maybe you have seen someone selling laying hens on craigslist or @entity168 , ' he wrote in his @entity168 plea			0
' maybe the guy down the street just put up a sign			0
' perhaps your local feed store has some really beautiful chickens that do n't fit any variety specifically			0
they could be our birds			0
' he asked for anyone with information about the whereabouts of his stolen hens to contact the @entity207 , which said it is unclear if it will investigate			1

half of the 600 to 700 chickens on @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 were apparently stolen earlier this month
devastated owner @entity7 , who raised the birds by hand , says the theft has cost him as much as $ 22,000
the ' @entity22 ' hens lay pink , blue , green and cream eggs , which are particularly *popular* around @entity6
@entity7 is now appealing for information to get his chickens back
