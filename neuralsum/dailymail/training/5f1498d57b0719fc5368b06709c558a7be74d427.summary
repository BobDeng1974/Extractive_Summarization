rev @entity2 of @entity13 gave the benediction at a prayer vigil attended by leaders from @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20 faiths , as well as by president @entity21 and relatives of the 20 first graders who were killed			2
@entity2 requested an announcement before the event explaining that participating clergy were not endorsing each other 's views			2
but in a statement posted february 1 , the @entity32 president , the @entity31 , said @entity2 's ' specific and commendable ' steps to avoid violating the church 's constitution remained insufficient			1
he said the event constituted joint worship since other clergy wore their vestments and the vigil included prayers and religious readings			1
@entity41 wrote : ' there is sometimes a real tension between wanting to bear witness to @entity45 and at the same time avoiding situations which may give the impression that our differences with respect to who @entity51 is , who @entity45 is , how he deals with us and how we get to heaven , really do n't matter in the end			0
@entity2 does not believe he engaged in joint worship , but has apologised			1
in his own statement , @entity2 underscored the steps he took to avoid any appearance he was supporting other doctrines			0
@entity61 president @entity21 spoke before @entity62 at the memorial service for the victims and relatives of the @entity9 shooting ' to those who believe that i have endorsed false teaching , i assure you that was not my intent , and i give you my unreserved apologies , ' he wrote			0
' i did not believe my participation to be an act of joint worship , but one of mercy and care to a community shocked and grieving an unspeakably horrific event			1
however , i recognize others in our church consider it to constitute joint worship and i understand why			2
' ' i accept his apology , ' @entity31 wrote , and made what he called an earnest request that no one file a complaint against @entity2 under the denomination 's disciplinary system			1
@entity31 declined to comment further , but @entity93 , a spokeswoman for the denomination , told @entity1 : ' we are proud of the work pastor @entity2 has done in @entity9 and how he has served the community in so many ways			1
' the denomination has been struggling for years with this rule , which is currently under a broad review			0
the church constitution requires congregants to renounce ' unionism and syncretism of every description			0
' a @entity32 pastor , the @entity107 , was suspended for a time after participating in a @entity109 interfaith service soon after the september 11 attacks that was held in @entity109			2
about two dozen pastors and a few congregations had complained about @entity107 's involvement			0
the 2.3 million - member @entity32 , based in the @entity115 area , is separate from the larger , liberal @entity116 , based in @entity117			0
