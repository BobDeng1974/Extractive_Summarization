a dental expert has claimed that the effects of gum disease have been exaggerated to sell mouthwash and expensive toothbrushes			1
@entity5 , a senior lecturer at @entity7 's dental public health unit , has insisted that gum disease - or periodontitis - is a normal part of ageing and bleeding when you brush does not mean your teeth will fall out			1
he explained that brushing regularly with a fluoride toothpaste is the best method of protecting your teeth from decay - a more serious problem			1
mr @entity5 told @entity32 : ' it 's an overstated problem			1
if you do n't brush your teeth you will tend to get some inflammation and bleeding , but that will not have the impact that has been suggested			2
' to say it will end with all your teeth falling out if you do n't do something about it , that 's over-egging the pudding			2
' you 're creating a problem and then people will buy something			2
' he explained only 10 % of people need treatment for gum - related problems and dentists should focus on smokers and those with a poor diet			0
he added that people should not ignore bleeding gums because they indicate poor brushing which can then lead to tooth decay			0
mr @entity5 says the problem of gum disease is ' overstated ' to sell pricey products , like mouthwash and electrical toothbrushes			1
' you 're creating a problem and then people will buy something ' but @entity70 , professor of periodontology , @entity72 , said gum disease can be treated by dental professionals to prevent long term tooth loss in more severe cases			1
he said : ' we are beginning to have a much better understanding of the impacts of periodontitis			0
' we learn that periodontitis is not a silent disease , but has significant impacts on patients ' quality of life , not just in terms of tooth loss , but also in terms of function , comfort , aesthetics and self esteem			0
' he added : ' it is clear that we as dental professionals can genuinely do something about the condition			0
' time and time again periodontal treatment has been shown to be highly effective in preventing long - term tooth loss and reversing many of the condition 's other adverse effects			0
