president @entity0 announced his intention today to send up to 300 @entity3 military advisers into @entity4 to help train the country 's military			1
the president expressly stated that the move does not ' foreshadow ' a military intervention and said sending troops back into @entity4 to fight radical extremists would not benefit the @entity3 ' @entity3 forces will not be returning to combat in @entity4 , ' @entity0 said , ' but we will help @entity4 as they take the fight to terrorists who threaten the @entity4 people , the region and @entity3 interests , as well			1
' the president also said the @entity3 was currently ‘ identifying targets ’ associated with the @entity22 terrorist group and that the @entity3 would take ‘ targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it ' - an obvious nod to air strikes			1
@entity3 forces still wo n't be engaging in combat he promised after meeting with national security advisers early this afternoon , the president said in a statement that the @entity3 intended would coordinate with @entity4 security forces , put up joint operation centers in @entity38 and share intelligence with the @entity4 government			1

@entity0 told members of @entity57 during a meeting on wednesday that he did not need their permission to take the actions he was considering			0
however , he said on thursday that he would continue to work with @entity57 to provide additional equipment to the @entity4 military through his newly created @entity62 and that he would consult @entity57 , as well as @entity4 leaders , if he decided to pull the trigger on air strikes			1
@entity4 prime minister @entity66 , a @entity67 , has asked president @entity0 for air strikes against the @entity71 militants who have been carving a wide swath through his country , but @entity0 has been slow to comply			1
the president told congressional leaders yesterday that the @entity3 does not have strong enough intelligence at this time to carry out the strikes , an aide with knowledge of the discussion told the @entity81 yesterday			2
@entity0 also expressed anxiety about the number of civilian casualties that the strikes could cause , as well concerns about instability within @entity4 's government			1
the president said last week that he would not provide @entity4 with military assistance until the country 's leaders made serious moves toward putting their sectarian differences aside			2
standing up for themselves : more than 200,000 @entity4 have volunteered to defend their country , including this group of farmers vice president @entity99 spoke on wednesday with @entity66 , the country 's @entity71 parliamentary speaker and the the president of the country 's self - ruled @entity103 region			1
he praised their efforts to bring together their respective communities in a televised show of unity against @entity22 , the @entity105 said			0
lawmakers have been putting pressure on @entity0 to call for @entity66 's resignation for days , and the @entity113 said reported thursday morning that @entity0 might ask @entity66 to resign as a @entity115 effort to stop the country 's civil war			1
however , @entity0 repeatedly said on thursday , ' it 's not the place for the @entity3 to choose @entity4 's leaders			1
' there is an ' urgent ' need for @entity4 to convene a new parliament that gives all @entity4 the sense that they are part of a unity government , though , @entity0 said			0
' right now what is happening is the fate of @entity4 hangs in the balance			0
' the @entity3 president hedged when asked at a presser thursday after his statement if he had lost faith in @entity66 to lead the country and referred back to his previous statements			2

speaking at a conference in @entity155 , @entity149 said the @entity4 government needed to reach out to the @entity71 minority before the @entity3 got involved militarily			0
he said : ' if the @entity3 is to support the @entity4 government it would have to be a government against terrorism , rather than one side in a civil war			2
' ' this can not be the @entity3 being the air force for @entity67 militias , or a @entity67 on @entity71 @entity167 fight , ' he told the @entity168 on @entity169			0
president @entity0 expressed concern at doing just that on thursday and again called on @entity4 's government to come together to fight the common treat to their nation			1
he also fired a warning shot at @entity178			0
the @entity3 welcome 's the country to play a ' constructive role ' in @entity4 , he said , but ' if @entity178 is coming in solely as an armed force on behalf of the @entity67 , and it is framed in that fashion , that probably worsens the situation			2
' ' obviously what has happened in @entity186 in part is the result of @entity178 coming in hot and heavy ' on one side , @entity0 said , referring to the upheaval in that country			0
@entity0 said he hopes @entity178 will take a ' more promising path ' in @entity4 , ' but old habits die hard			0
' deployment : @entity54 launches off the flight deck of the aircraft carrier @entity47 during flight operations in the @entity198 after the ship was deployed into the @entity198 in response to the crisis in @entity4 @entity203 helicopter lands on the aircraft carrier @entity47 during flight operations in the @entity198 on june 17 , 2014 yesterday 's surveillance missions mark the first declared @entity3 flyovers since @entity3 troops left @entity4 at the end of 2011			1
reports first surfaced on @entity210 from @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 about the sorties , which are taking off and landing on the @entity47 , an aircraft carrier in the @entity198			2
the @entity0 administration had already authorized ' manned and unmanned ' surveillance flights , @entity213 reported			0
but f - 18s are not surveillance aircraft			0
a @entity3 official hinted to @entity213 that part of the strategy is to project strength by rolling out the big guns even on routine video and photo missions			0
' it 's not so much about looking as it is being seen , ' the official said			0
the @entity105 told reporters on wednesday afternoon that the president is still undecided about whether to commit military force to the country that once hosted 143,000 @entity3 servicemen and women			0
@entity0 said on thursday that he would prefer @entity4 's neighbors in the region step up instead			2
on that note @entity0 said he would be sending secretary of state @entity239 to the @entity240 and @entity241 to meet with the @entity3 's allies abroad about working together to quell the violence in @entity4			2
' rather than play whack - a - mole where these terrorist networks pop up , ' the president said , the @entity3 has to be able to build effective partnerships			0
the big picture : @entity22 has taken the red - shaded areas in this map and are making progress in their advance toward @entity38			0
