they may look like ancient aliens , but these strange fossilised creatures are a distant relative of humans			2
more than 100 years after they were discovered , experts have identified the fossils as vetulicolians – blind marine creatures that swam 500 million years ago			1
they believe that the ancient animals are among humans ’ distant cousins because they had a rod through their tail similar to a backbone			1
this 500 - million - year - old fossil has been used by @entity17 researchers to make their discovery about vetulicolians			2
these marine creatures had a rod through their tail similar to a backbone , which places them as distant cousins of vertebrate animals , they claim researchers at the @entity28 in @entity29 , explained that the marine creatures were ' filter - feeders ' shaped like a figure - of - 8			1
their strange anatomy has meant that no - one has been able to place them accurately on the tree of life , until now			0
in a new paper published in @entity40 , they argue that the alien - like animals should be placed within the same group that includes vertebrate animals , because of a ‘ rod ’ structure in their anatomy			2
‘ although not directly related to humans in the evolutionary line , we can confirm that these ancient water creatures are among our distant cousins , ’ said lead author of the paper , dr @entity50 , of the university 's @entity51			1
an artists 's impression of the 500 - million - year - old marine creatures known as vetulicolians , now believed to be distant cousins of vertebrate animals such as humans and fish			1
scientists say these blind ' filter feeders ' were once abundant throughout the world it may seem strange that a blind marine creature shaped like the number eight could be an ancient relative of humans			1
but scientists say vetulicolians , which lived 500 million years ago , are a distant cousin of humans because they had a rod through their tails			1
this rod resembles a notochord , which is the precursor of the backbone and is unique to vertebrates and their relatives			0
this has lead experts to argue that the creatures should be placed within the same group that includes vertebrate animals , such as humans			2
‘ they are close relatives of vertebrates - animals with backbones , such as ourselves			0
‘ @entity92 have a long tail supported by a stiff rod			0
this rod resembles a notochord , which is the precursor of the backbone and is unique to vertebrates and their relatives , ’ he said			0
although the first specimens were studied in 1911 , it took until 1997 for the fossils to be described as a group on their own : the vetulicolians			0
these fossils have now been discovered in countries all across the globe , such as @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity29			0
the latest insights into vetulicolians have come from new fossils discovered on @entity112 off the coast of @entity29			1
‘ @entity92 are further evidence that life was very rich in diversity during the cambrian period , in some aspects more than it is today , with many extra branches on the evolutionary tree , ’ dr @entity50 said			0
‘ they were simple yet successful creatures , large in number and in distribution across the globe , and one of the first representatives of our cousins , which include sea squirts and salps			0
’ in the evolutionary tree , @entity17 researchers have now grouped the mysterious , extinct creatures known as vetulicolians on a branch alongside vertebrate animals			0
although not in the same direct evolutionary line , this places the 500 - million - year - old marine creatures as distant cousins of humans			1

fossils were discovered 100 years ago but *remained* a mystery until recently
creatures have been identified as vetulicolians – blind marine creatures
they were filter - feeders shaped like a figure - of - 8 , living 500 million years ago
scientists at the @entity28 , @entity29 , found they had a rod through their tail , similar to a backbone
they want vetulicolians to be placed within the same group that includes vertebrae animals such as humans and say they are our distant cousins
