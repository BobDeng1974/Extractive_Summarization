drivers across @entity1 be warned - there 's an ' unmanned ' car on the road			0
a driverless car is currently on a cross-country road trip to test the state - of - the - art technology that allows a driver to sit back and relax with no hands on the wheel			1
@entity11 launched the first coast - to - coast test of a driverless car on sunday , starting at the @entity14 in @entity15			1
for the next week , the specially rigged @entity16 will be headed on a 3,500 mile journey to @entity18			1
two people will be in the car at all times to take over the controls in emergencies - or more often , construction zones			2
@entity11 , one of the largest suppliers of automotive electronics and safety systems , is using the long journey in the @entity52 crossover to acquire 2.3 terabytes data from a sophisticated array of cameras , radar and lidar - a laser mapping technology			1
the @entity11 drive kicked off march 22 near @entity15 's @entity14 , with plans to wind up in @entity18 just before the annual auto show opens there on april 3			1
during the coast - to - coast journey in the @entity52 , at least two @entity11 engineers will be aboard , including one behind the wheel			1
the venture informed all of the states it will pass through about its unmanned car , and all of them agreed to let the vehicle travel on their roads			2
the car comes with 20 sensors including four short - range radars , three vision - based cameras , six lidars , a localization system and a driver assistance program			1
the @entity80 - based firm also wants to test and demonstrate its wireless and active safety systems			0
@entity11 's demonstration underscores growing interest and investments by automakers and suppliers in self - driving cars , some of which could be production - ready by 2020			2
@entity90 , @entity11 's chief technology officer , sees the automated driver assistance systems in the @entity52 as building blocks on the road to fully self - driving cars in the next decade			1
@entity11 has been working on automated cars since 1999 , when it split from @entity96 , according to @entity97			2
@entity98 , which has also been working on self - driving cars , has made public statements about having such a vehicle available in five years			0
the tech giant has been testing out its vehicles around its @entity105 , @entity106 , campus			0
@entity107 , the electric car brainchild of @entity109 , also announced last week that new software out this summer will let cars be largely automatic on the highway			0
smart car : the @entity52 is decked out with a range of sensors ( pictured ) that include our short - range radars , three vision - based cameras and six lidars , a laser mapping technology making improvements : @entity11 , one of the largest suppliers of automotive electronics and safety systems , is using the long journey in the @entity52 crossover to acquire data from a sophisticated array of cameras and radars the @entity52 heading to @entity18 will be able to stop and proceed at four - way stops and find the best way to get around cyclists , according to @entity11			1
it can also navigate complicated procedures such as merging on to the highway			0
though commuters may be dreaming of kicking back on the way to work , @entity137 said , ' our view is that the driver is going to be in the seat for a long time ' in case of emergency situations			0
during the coast - to - coast journey , one of two engineers aboard will be behind the wheel			0
@entity11 will now test such functions as traffic jam assist , automated highway pilot with lane change and automated parking and valet			2
all of those systems are expected to be introduced in production cars over the next two to three years			0
the car had previously been tested on the streets of @entity160 during the @entity162 conference and has been on road trips between the @entity164 and @entity165			0
video of the car 's steering wheel moving on its own can be seen on @entity170			0
fully automated systems that may be phased in after 2020 could add about $ 5,000 to the cost of a car , estimates @entity174 , vice president of advanced and product engineering for @entity11 's electronics and safety division			2
car of the future ? development times for self - driving cars ( pictured ) vary , with @entity98 saying it could have one on the road in five years safety first : the firm also wants to test and demonstrate its active safety systems ( above ) designed to prevent crashes and keep the car in its lane the car and its potential human drivers will not travel at night or in difficult weather as they make their way to @entity18 @entity11 is providing some of the components and technology , including vehicle - to - vehicle connectivity , for @entity96 's @entity198 automated driving system , which will debut in 2016 on the new @entity200 sedan			1
during the cross-country trek , the vehicle will be challenged under a variety of driving conditions from changing weather and terrain to potential road hazards -- things that could never truly be tested in a lab. the @entity52 will avoid harsh weather and not drive at night , according to @entity211 it will drive about eight hours a day			1
while states such as @entity106 are just beginning to allow testing of automated vehicles , all of the states the car will pass through are allowing the unmanned car on their roads			0
@entity11 director @entity221 said that once the automation system is tested it will be applicable to any car model			1
an @entity225 company took a driverless van 8,000 miles from @entity227 to @entity228 in 2010 .			0

@entity11 began cross-country test of driverless vehicle on sunday
the car left @entity15 and is headed to @entity18 for an april 3 car show
two people will be in the specially rigged @entity52 in case of emergencies
car includes 20 sensors , including four radars and laser mapping system
