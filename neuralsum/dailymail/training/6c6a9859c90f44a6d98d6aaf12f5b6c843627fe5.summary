the frail mother of a @entity1 mp was subjected to ‘ disgraceful and shabby ’ treatment in a @entity4 hospital and later died in an ambulance delayed by equipment shortages			1
@entity7 says she feels retired hospital worker @entity8 , 80 , was ‘ let down ’ by the @entity9 , for which she gave her entire working life			1
mrs @entity8 was admitted to hospital in may , after showing signs of a stroke , her daughter said			1
but hospital staff initially failed to diagnose the condition and even tried to send her home			2
@entity19 mp @entity7 , left , believes that her mother @entity8 , right , was let down by the @entity9 in @entity4 it was only at @entity24 ’s daughter ’s insistence – because of repeated hallucinations , visual impairment and signs of weakness – that she was re-evaluated			1
a stroke was finally diagnosed after four days in hospital			2
yesterday , mrs @entity7 raised her mother ’s case and her ‘ concern ’ about the state of the @entity9 in the @entity35 during @entity36			1
@entity37 told her : ‘ the @entity9 in @entity4 is in trouble and that is not because of hard - working doctors and nurses , but because of a @entity9 administration which cut the @entity9 and failed to reform it			2
’ mrs @entity7 told the @entity43 : ‘ what happened to my mother was disgraceful			2
without someone advocating on her behalf , nothing would have been done			0
the staff were lovely but they were run off their feet			0
’ the ward on which , mrs @entity8 , widowed from her husband @entity55 20 years ago , stayed was hit by a shortage of basic items such as a water beaker or working television			1
after spilling water on one occasion , she was refused a change of sheets			2
a former colleague of mrs @entity8 also told mrs main her mother had been moved to a bed with dirty sheets unchanged from the previous occupant			1
mrs @entity8 was discharged a week later and her family told it would be another five weeks before an occupational therapist could visit			1
she was looked after for six weeks by @entity72 at her home , before returning to @entity74 to her own home , which had been fitted with a panic button			0
her son stayed with her			0
the day of the occupational therapist ’s visit on july 23 , mrs @entity8 had a fall when her son was out collecting prescriptions , and pressed her alarm			2
it took 15 minutes for initial help to arrive from the council and another 20 minutes for an ambulance			0
there were ‘ substantial ’ delays after the paramedics decided to use an inflatable mattress used to protect patients against spinal injuries			0
there was no valve , so they had to call another ambulance for extra parts			0
mrs @entity8 , who had been drifting out of consciousness as she waited , deteriorated further on the way to hospital and was rerouted to resuscitation but died before it could be carried out			1
mrs @entity7 wrote to former welsh secretary @entity103 before her mother ’s death in july and later to @entity4 parliamentary under - secretary @entity106			1
the @entity19 mp for @entity108 said : ‘ i was horrified when they initially said my mother was going home before a stroke had been diagnosed			2
she was so obviously unwell and in my view unfit to be discharged			0
’ a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death , saying mrs @entity8 ’s head injuries from the fall were so severe that hospital staff could not have saved her			1
but mrs @entity7 said : ‘ my mother spent her working life in the @entity9 , at another @entity74 hospital , @entity122 ’s			1
the hospital where she was treated seems to have gone to rack and ruin			0
’ @entity125 , chief operating officer for @entity74 and @entity126 , said : ‘ we would like to offer our condolences to the family and sincerely apologise for any distress			0
the health board is fully committed to investigating and addressing these issues			0
