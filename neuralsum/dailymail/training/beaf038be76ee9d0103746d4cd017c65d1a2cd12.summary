@entity0 has pulled out of the @entity1 in @entity2 because of a thigh injury and will be replaced by @entity4			1
@entity4 , who has been practising at the @entity5 all week as the first alternate , will take on @entity7 on thursday afternoon in the final round of matches in @entity10 the @entity11 only missed out on a place in the top eight at the very last minute after @entity0 defeated @entity14 on his way to the final at the @entity17 a fortnight ago			1
@entity0 announced his withdrawal from the @entity1 at a press conference on thursday @entity0 lost both of his matches on his debut at the tournament and revealed he suffered the injury in tuesday 's defeat by @entity26			1
' i have a slight tear in my quad and a large area of swelling , ' he said			0
' it would be unfair to fans if i was to go out and play a mediocre match			0
if i was to step out on court i could lose up to six to eight weeks			0
that was a significant factor in my decision			0
' @entity0 's decision potentially has a significant impact on the qualification hopes of both @entity7 and @entity26 , who meets @entity14 later on thursday			1
@entity0 , pictured in action against @entity26 , suffered a thigh injury during defeat by the @entity44 there had been a scenario whereby @entity26 could lose to @entity14 and still make the semi-finals if @entity7 had also lost to @entity0			1
but , instead of a three - way tie being decided by sets or games percentage , as would have been the case , a player playing fewer matches is automatically eliminated from the race leaving the remaining two players to be split by head - to - head			0
because @entity26 lost his opening match to @entity7 , he must now beat @entity14 to stand a chance of going through			2
should @entity7 lose , any win for @entity26 would be enough , but victory for the @entity62 player would mean the @entity44 must win in straight sets and hope his games percentage is better than either @entity7 or @entity14			2
@entity0 's replacement @entity4 plays a forehand during his match against @entity7 at the @entity5 there is no way @entity4 can progress but the @entity11 is a player no one likes facing because of his resemblance to a human wall , and @entity7 will certainly not be expecting anything less than a stern test			1
@entity4 may also have extra motivation from the fact it was his loss to @entity7 in @entity77 that secured @entity0 's place in @entity2 ahead of him			2
the @entity62 player , who has his own injury worries after receiving treatment to his right wrist against @entity14 , has won five of their previous eight meetings , including all three this season , but every one has been extremely close			0
@entity87 expects no more ' easy ' matches			0

@entity0 lost to @entity26 and @entity90 at the @entity5
@entity4 will play @entity0 's final group game against @entity7
