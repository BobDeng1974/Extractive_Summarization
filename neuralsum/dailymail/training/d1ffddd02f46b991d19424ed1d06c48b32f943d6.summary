by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 perhaps the most telling thing about @entity4 ’ departure from @entity5 after just 18 months as their manager , and just one game into the new season , was that it was not a surprise			1
the tale is one typical of the @entity12 in recent years			2
incredibly , @entity13 is the longest - serving manager in the division having been at newly - promoted @entity15 for two years and 124 days			1
that , in times gone by - even recent times - would be considered barely a bedding in period			0
telling : @entity4 departed the managerial post at @entity5 after just one game of the new season servant : @entity15 boss @entity13 is the longest - serving championship manager at 2 years , 124 days @entity13 - @entity15 : 2 years , 124 days @entity24 - @entity23 : 2 years , 46 days @entity26 - @entity25 : 1 year , 302 days @entity27 : 1 years , 292 days @entity28 - @entity29 : 1 year , 283 days yet there are 22 clubs in the second tier with managers who have been in their posts for less than two years - and that was the case even before @entity4 was sacked			1
the only other manager to have been in his job for over two years , @entity24 , is on thin ice at @entity23 having kept them up only in the dying seconds of last season , and following an abject defeat at @entity42 at the weekend			2
@entity13 is only 19th on the list of the longest - serving managers in @entity46 ’s top four divisions			2
ahead of him are four from the @entity47 , eight from @entity48 and six from @entity50			0
and , let ’s not forget , the @entity15 boss was a @entity48 manager until three months ago			0
championship waters are the most treacherous for managers in @entity46 , and it ’s no coincidence			2
relegated teams arrive with the intention of getting straight back up to the @entity47 and increasingly , with foreign investment dripping down in to the lower leagues , teams promoted from @entity48 have the same ambition			0
in @entity63 and two , there are plenty of clubs and fans just happy to maintain their @entity69 status , just as in the @entity47 where the majority are content with staying put			0
runner up : @entity23 boss @entity24 is second on the list at 2 years , 46 days but if you are just happy to be in the championship , as @entity74 were last season , you ’ll come straight back down			1
@entity74 manager @entity76 , ironically , would be the longest - serving manager in the @entity12 had his side stayed up - maybe those trigger - happy owners have a point after all			0
it is its volatility that makes the championship so exciting , just maybe not for the managers			2
three is the magic number the @entity47 season may not have started yet but @entity88 has already had an effect on @entity46 football			0
the @entity92 ’s use of a 3 - 5 - 2 formation at the @entity94 - where the system was also used successfully by @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 - inspired several managers to try it out on the @entity69 ’s opening weekend			1
@entity102 have used the system for the past two seasons in the @entity12 under @entity105 and @entity106 , and @entity108 ’s long - serving boss @entity107 has regularly used three at the back over his lengthy tenure in @entity112			0
advocate : @entity102 boss @entity114 has been using 3 - 5 - 2 like @entity88 but it is in @entity48 where the @entity117 effect seems to have really taken hold , with @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 all trying the formation which worked so well in @entity123			1
@entity119 shocked @entity124 2 - 1 at @entity125 , @entity121 - fielding a side with an average age of just 21 - were very impressive in beating @entity128 3 - 1 , while @entity120 performed well despite going down 3 - 2 at @entity129			1
expect to see more teams try it out as the season goes on			0
talent scout : @entity134 ( @entity135 ) it has been a turbulent 2014 so far for @entity135 , but their 1 - 1 draw at @entity138 on saturday provided hope for the future , not least the performance of 22 - year - old striker @entity134			1
the @entity143 - born @entity142 international who arrived from @entity146 was a powerful threat all day long at @entity148 , and scored the opening with a header from a corner			0
promising : @entity135 's 22 - year - old forward @entity134 looks a useful addition for the @entity154 however , while his performance will have delighted boss @entity156 , too many more like that and parent club @entity158 could come calling in january .			1

*robins* leaving @entity5 after just one game is typical of championship
just two managers in division have been in charge for more than two years
3 - 5 - 2 formation could have a *big* impact in the football league this season
@entity135 forward @entity173 could be a real talent for the future
