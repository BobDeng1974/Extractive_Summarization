former @entity1 head @entity0 is attributing the years - long drought in @entity3 to ' liberal environmentalists , ' whom she says brought on the state 's water shortage with their policies			1
' it is a man - made disaster , ' she told @entity10 during a monday radio interview			1
' with different policies over the last 20 years , all of this could be avoided			1
' the ' tragedy ' of @entity3 , @entity0 , a maybe presidential candidate , said , is it ' has suffered from droughts for millennia , ' and still ' liberal environmentalists have prevented the building of a single new reservoir or a single new water conveyance system over decades during a period in which @entity3 ’s population has doubled			1
' @entity3 is a classic case of liberals being willing to sacrifice other people ’s lives and livelihoods at the altar of their ideology			0
it ’s a tragedy , ' @entity0 , a one - time @entity42 candidate , told @entity10 , on @entity45 station			2
with the drought stretching into its fourth year , @entity3 's @entity47 governor @entity46 last week signed an executive order limiting water consumption			1
excluded from the new restrictions , however , was the agricultural industry , which is responsible for 80 percent of the state 's water usage			0
republicans in the @entity57 @entity56 approved a bill at the end of last year allowing water to be redistributed from the @entity61 to drought - affected areas of the state , but the legislation died in the then - @entity65 - controlled @entity42			1
the measure was opposed by environmental groups , who said the water transportation system would disrupt the habitat of certain fish species , and the @entity72 had said the president would veto the bill if it passed			1
zeroing in on president @entity75 , @entity0 , a @entity29 , said monday , that ' [ he ] goes out to @entity3 a little over a year ago , calls it a tragedy of global warming and hands out money to a food bank			2
' ' this is all about politics and policy , and it is liberal environmentalists who have brought us this tragedy , ' she continued			0
@entity0 , now a resident of @entity88 , was referring to the president 's february 2014 visit to @entity91			0
there he pledged to give @entity3 's food banks $ 60 million in aid , in addition to monies he said the state 's farmers would receive , $ 15 million , and monies that were set aside for watershed improvement measures			0
zeroing in on president @entity75 , @entity0 said monday , that ' [ he ] goes out to @entity3 a little over a year ago , calls it a tragedy of global warming and hands out money to a food bank			0
'' this is all about politics and policy , and it is liberal environmentalists who have brought us this tragedy , ' she continued			0
@entity75 is pictured here in @entity114 during the trip @entity0 referred to one of the so - called liberal environmental groups that @entity0 blamed on monday for the state 's water woes later told the @entity119 that the @entity29 politician 's argument was ' irrational			1
' knocking her as ' a science denier , ' @entity122 said it was rich for @entity0 ' to opine that @entity47 caused the drought in @entity3			2
' that 's ' about as irrational as believing someone who failed at running a business in @entity3 and then failed as a candidate for office in @entity3 has any cause to be running for the highest office in the land , ' the organization 's spokesman , @entity127 , said			0
another group , the @entity137 , took issue with the scientific aspect of her claims			0
' for more than 100 years , environmentalists have failed to stop the damming of nearly every significant river in @entity3			0
and yet all of the hundreds of dams out there have done nothing to produce rain or snow pack over the last four years , ' @entity151 , director of the @entity3 chapter of the national organization , said , according to the @entity119			2
' that 's because you ca n't store what 's not there , ' she said			1
' we simply do n't have rain or snow pack and are suffering the worst @entity3 drought since water agencies and weather trackers started keeping records			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity0 doubled down her boss ' claims in an email to @entity169 , saying , ' it is clear that the radical environmental lobby would prefer to ignore the facts on this one			1
' ' we are n't storing rainfall or building water conveyance systems in @entity3 because they are willing to put fish before people , ' @entity0 spokeswoman @entity174 said			1
taking the argument a step further , @entity174 asserted that ' over 300 billion gallons of water are diverted away from farmers in the @entity183 and into the @entity184 in order to protect the @entity186 smelt , an endangered fish that environmentalists have continued to champion at the expense of @entity3			2
' ' meanwhile , the president is touting the money he is sending to food banks but refuses to do anything about the 70 % of rainfall that is going out to sea , ' she added			0
' those are n't talking points			0

' it is a man - made disaster , ' she said . ' with different policies over the last 20 years , all of this could be avoided '
' @entity211 environmentalists have prevented the building of a single new reservoir or a single new water conveyance system , ' she *accused*
one of the so - called liberal environmental groups @entity0 blamed later knocked her political savvy and said her argument was ' irrational '
another group said hundreds of dams in @entity3 have n't helped with the drought - ' that 's because you ca n't store what 's not there '
a spokeswoman for @entity0 told @entity169 , ' it is clear that the radical environmental lobby would prefer to ignore the facts on this one '
