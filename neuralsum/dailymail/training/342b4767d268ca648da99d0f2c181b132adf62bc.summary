by @entity0 published : 02:16 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 10:39 est , 3 december 2012 the new version of @entity3 's @entity2 has just been released after a series of delays - but some are asking whether the music player may have had its day			1
@entity2 11 is said to be one of the biggest steps forward the software has ever made , and its revamped design and new features have largely received rave reviews			1
however , critics have pointed out that the programme is unable to access streaming music online , and suggested that this could harm the firm in the battle against newer services such as @entity20 and @entity21			1
it is now the hub which controls devices such as @entity39 , iphones and @entity41 , and is used to access @entity3 's huge store of music , video and e-books for sale online			0
previous versions of @entity2 have come under fire over the last few years for being increasingly slow and difficult to use - but version 11 , released on thursday , apparently remedies many of those flaws			2
reviewers at top tech websites praised the software 's overhaul - @entity54 described it as ' lightning quick ' , while @entity56 said it ' feels new and looks great '			0
mode : it is now easier to browse around the music of any one artist multiple devices : but @entity2 11 does not allow users to access music streaming services in the new era of cloud computing , @entity2 11 is closely integrated with @entity3 's online services			1
the programme encourages users to download music instantly from artists they already listen to , automatically uploads files to @entity3 's @entity73 service and enables you to keep your place in any book , podcast or video even when switching devices			0
but it has no capacity to access the nearly infinite libraries of streaming music which millions of web users now depend upon - and some say that could prove a fatal flaw for the future of @entity2			2
services like @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity91 all give users the ability to listen to a collection of music far larger than any single person would ever be able to download , for the price of a monthly subscription			1
their popularity has even led some music fans to dump their own collection altogether - making @entity2 completely redundant			2
multimedia : @entity3 hopes to persuade users not to confine themselves to accessing music with the software new logo : @entity3 has stream - lined the icon it uses to represent @entity2 so the fact that @entity3 provides no capability for users to unite streaming music with a permanent collection could be its fatal flaw , according to some experts			2
@entity54 boss @entity115 tweeted : ' @entity2 11 installed , and			0
uh ... i do n't have any locally stored music anymore			0
all on @ rdio and @ spotify			0
' while web designer @entity120 quipped : ' @entity2 11 installed , opened , closed ... back to @entity20			1
' there are rumours that @entity2 is set to add internet radio stations , which would be personalised to users ' individual tastes , but until they launch them the service could have trouble finding a foothold in the fast - changing media landscape .			0

venerable music player could be beaten by @entity20 and @entity21
*dramatic* *improvement* in design may not be enough to save @entity2
