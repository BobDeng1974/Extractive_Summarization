she established her reputation for calculated malice in a one - line message designed to devastate her love - rival			0
@entity5 , the 47 - year - old girlfriend of @entity7 president @entity6 , caused outrage when she used her @entity10 account to publicly back a political opponent of @entity12 , mr @entity6 's ex-partner and mother of his four children			1
ms @entity12 , 58 , went on to lose her bid to become mp for @entity17 earlier this month , later blaming the hated ms @entity5 for a vicious stab - in - the - back which effectively ended her career			1
cheesy : @entity7 's controversial new first lady @entity5 ( left ) gushed over @entity6 in her new book where she also talks about the mother of the president 's four children @entity12 ( right ) @entity28 : the book detailing @entity6 's rise to power was written by his partner @entity5 and contains photographs by @entity33 now ms @entity5 , a glossy magazine journalist , has twisted the knife even further by supplying the captions for a new book tracing her own career elevation to first lady of @entity7			1
in ' @entity6 , president ' , she writes highly personal – and some would say extremely catty - commentaries beside a range of colour photographs			0
one shows mr @entity6 and ms @entity12 , who lived together for 30 years after falling in love as students , at a political rally in @entity47 , @entity48 , earlier this year			1

lots has been written since the start of the week , the photographers are here en masse			0
' beside a photograph of the two ex-lovers together , ms @entity5 writes : ' are they going to kiss , hold hands ? this is the crucial question my colleagues are asking			2
' as well as ms @entity12 's status as an ex-lover , ms @entity5 points to her status as an ex-presidential candidate who lost to @entity69 in 2007			1
satire : the @entity7 version of @entity72 , @entity73 , has predictably jumped in to poke fun at the love triangle telling off : following @entity5 's ( pictured right ) @entity10 comments , prime minister @entity76 said ' everyone should know their place ' @entity5 on stage after the results of the second round of the presidential election in @entity85 , southwestern @entity7 ms @entity5 continues : ' yes , the man i love had a woman before me			1
and she happened to be a presidential election candidate			0
i have to live with it			0
' ms @entity12 , like mr @entity6 a passionate @entity91 , always dreamed that they would make a golden left - wing couple on the world stage , but instead it is ms @entity5 who finds herself in the @entity97			1
ms @entity12 in fact lost yet another election when she stood in the primaries against mr @entity6 last year			2
recalling the night when mr @entity6 learnt he was victorious , ms @entity5 writes : ' as soon as we heard the result , we went off on our own together for a few moments			2
' he took me in his arms			0
both of us were emotional			0
' there were even more dramatic scenes back in 2011 when – on may 14 – mr @entity112 and ms @entity5 learned that @entity113 , the president of the @entity114 , was arrested in @entity115 for allegedly trying to rape a chamber maid			1
@entity117 : @entity6 initially painted himself as an antidote to the flash previous president @entity69 , who married model @entity122 mr @entity113 had been the hot favorite to become @entity91 president this year , but his humiliation in @entity126 ended all hope of a successful political career , and opened the door for mr @entity6			0
recalling the fateful night , ms @entity5 said : ' i wake up @entity131 up quickly			2
by way of answer he whispers " go back to sleep , all this is bullshit "			2
i check the mail and i insist that the news is already out			0
' the book is full of gushy praise for the president the twice - divorced ms @entity5 calls ' my man '			1
she says ' @entity131 is always online when crisis requires ' and that his election campaign meant moments ' of solitude , moments of tension and of great joy '			0
ms @entity5 has continued to write for @entity149 since becoming @entity150 and , in a review of a book called breaking the charm this month , wrote : ' every family lugs around its share of dramas , secrets , and elephants in the room			1
' despite her apparent confidence , ms @entity5 is known to be upset that the four adult children of mr @entity6 and ms @entity12 have stopped speaking to her			1
she was initially defiant about the malicious tweet , but has now admitted to friends in @entity166 that she ' made a mistake '			0
mr @entity6 , meanwhile , was said to be ' furious ' at what his new lover had done , telling her that ' it can never happen again '			0
in turn , ms @entity12 said she was ' deeply wounded ' by the ' violent blow ' of ms @entity5 's tweet			1
if she had won @entity17 , mr @entity6 was set to appoint ms @entity175 speaker of the @entity176 – the third most important political position in @entity7 after president and prime minister			0
instead she has become increasingly bitter , even accusing ms @entity5 of plotting against her ever since she started a relationship with her ex-partner			2
ms @entity5 met mr @entity6 while covering the @entity182 for @entity149 in 2005 , but their affair was kept secret while ms @entity12 fought the 2007 election campaign			1
