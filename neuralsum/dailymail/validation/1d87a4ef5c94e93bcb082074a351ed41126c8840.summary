dangerous man - eater on the loose in @entity1 ! on closer inspection it turned out to be @entity5 presenter @entity4 interviewing the prime minister for breakfast			1
the @entity10 eyelashes beat like the wings of a butterfly trapped at a window pane			2
she pouted until her lips must have ached worse than @entity16 ’s after a night on the toots			2
then she bit her pen – grrrrr ! shades of @entity20 in one of her leotarded jungle - vamp roles			2
my goodness political interviewing has come a distance since sir @entity26 and his bowtie			2
yesterday morning ’s broadcast was , unintentionally , comedy of a high order			1
it confirms miss @entity4 as heir to the late @entity33			1
the @entity45 - style steel fridge is covered with family photos and magnetic letters while the shelves house a mug collection and gleaming saucepans he had a character called @entity52 , a glammed - up tv dolly who would lift her whole derriere off the chair when she crossed her thighs			1
@entity58 used to scream that it was all being done ‘ in the best @entity61 taste ’			2
oh , @entity4 , we ’ll make a windmill girl out of you yet			1
in that @entity67 and @entity68 publicity still of you and the pm , you owned him , baby			2
and later your puppy eyes would not have disgraced an @entity73 advert			2
mr @entity37 , we will deduce , is on a personal publicity push			1
so are the other party leaders			2
only the quickest - fingered channel - surfers can these days avoid some fresh outrage against taste by senior politicians			2
tidying up : the pm at his fridge with some wine on show			1
there 's another bottle on the bench			2
the larder stores olive oils , condiments and - surprisingly - what seems to be salad a pm 's work is never done : tackling his paperwork among the children 's toothbrushes , a tube of toothpaste and a packet of @entity98 the @entity99 , mrs and clunky mr , popped up on the @entity102 bulletins the other night with their kiddywinks in a saccharine parkland scene			2
@entity105 was giving it full bluster on yesterday ’s @entity108 and had posed for another of his man - with - beer portraits in that pub - bore coat			1
@entity113 nationalist @entity112 was on breakfast telly on monday , giving the nation a fright with its frosties			2
meanwhile , @entity118 and the castanet clacker ( @entity119 ) posed for cheesy shots at their spring conference the other day			0
mr @entity37 , in addition to being grrrrrrilled by sultry @entity4 , yesterday had a soft double - page in @entity125 ’s @entity124 and an astonishing effort in the @entity127 he had given personal access to that red - top for an entire day , starting with @entity131 - style footage of him in his kitchen at dawn			1
what is it with politicians and their kitchens at present ? appearances : mr @entity37 , in addition to being grrrrrrilled by sultry @entity4 , yesterday had a soft double - page in @entity125 ’s @entity124 politics has surely not been so serious for decades yet our party leaders are behaving like teenagers mr @entity37 ’s in @entity1 , by the way , has a fridge as large as @entity147 ’s shoe closet			1
he also let @entity148 attach a camera to his body so we could see what it looked like to walk into no 10 as @entity69			1
for @entity156 ’s sake , you lot , you ’re contesting a general election , not some @entity160 ’s @entity159 beauty pageant			0
thanks to @entity148 ’s intimate web - video we saw a shirtsleeved prime minister licking his @entity165 ’s mayonnaise spoon and concocting a lunch of sardines on toast for the paper ’s political editor , who , when asked , declined to say they were delicious			1
when the @entity165 ’s went back in the enormous fridge we copped sight of a fair few bottles of vino			1
hic ! we heard our head of government go through his diary to convey what terribly busy days he has ( is this news ? ) and we saw him giving @entity181 a telling - off for being late to a @entity184 meeting			0
one actually quite interesting disclosure was that the prime minister calls @entity187 to order by ting - a - linging a little bell , the sort of thing found on the reception desks of small seaside hotels			1
puppy eyes : a flirtatious @entity4 interviews @entity37 in @entity195 for @entity196 yesterday yes prime minister ! @entity4 pulls a mischievous smile ( left ) and chews her pen ( right ) during the interview he yacked away happily with miss @entity4 about his childcare arrangements and how had just been to see @entity203 with his little daughter @entity204 endless , soft - focus shots caught the pm bidding hello to office underlings and doorkeepers , quite the breezy brigadier telling the little chaps what a splendid job they were doing			1
the camera lingered lovingly on the @entity214 ’ cat and on photographs on the walls of no 10			1
this would have been for something like through the @entity219 but it did not exactly elucidate the @entity222 ’s policies			0
how does such a soft - soap sell connect with the blue - collar vote the @entity225 must retrieve if we are to be spared a @entity228 government ? the film ended with the pm retiring at bedtime			0
we did not – phew – see him leaping into his pyjamas			0
@entity234 will have to wait until 2016 for a @entity187 post if the @entity225 win the general election , @entity37 signalled yesterday			1
the @entity125 mayor , who is the prime minister ’s chief leadership rival , is bidding to return to the @entity239 and has been tipped for various posts , including party chairman or head of a new infrastructure department			1
but mr @entity37 suggested that any appointment would have to wait until mr @entity234 steps down as mayor next year			1
‘ @entity234 can do anything , he defies all laws of political logic and gravity , ’ he said			0
‘ but i think he needs to focus on being mayor , strongly			0
being mp and the mayor is quite a lot			0
’ the @entity69 also spoke of how he and @entity254 differed , describing himself as a more traditional @entity222 and the chancellor as a ‘ metropolitan , market conservative ’			0
he added : ‘ we have both had our ups and downs			0
whenever i am down he will offer the hand up and when he is down i will offer the hand			0
’ asked who he would back to succeed him , mr @entity37 declined to name an individual – but identified five potential candidates : mr @entity234 and mr @entity254 as well as @entity266 , @entity181 and @entity267			1
he stopped the camera at the door to his family quarters , saying it could go no further			1
but it may have been a damn close call			0
perhaps such things as economic - industrial strategies and education proposals and political philosophies are no longer considered important by the image - benders and political spin doctors			0
perhaps this really is the way to win votes in 2015			0
but i have my doubts			0
politics has surely not been so serious for decades yet our party leaders are behaving like teenagers			0
the only one to have kept below the radar is the @entity290 ’ woman , @entity288 , but that is probably only because her nerve is shot after her recent mid-interview ‘ dry ’ on radio			0
back on @entity5 yesterday morning , miss @entity4 was unstoppable			1
incorrigible ! she kept touching her blushing cheeks , drew her mouth into sucky pools of winsome doubt , stroked one of her ears , tilted her black - maned head in a come - hither gesture			0
even the thickest @entity304 flag office would have been able to translate those signals			0
there were times , it must be admitted , when mr @entity37 gave her what we might call an old - fashioned glance , plainly wondering what on earth she had put in her tea			1
the thought ‘ who is this madwoman ? ’ flittered across his gaze			0
but hey , there is a general election in the offing			0
prime ministerial dignity was hauled overboard			2
soon he was yacking away happily with miss @entity4 about his childcare arrangements and how had just been to see @entity327 with his little daughter @entity204			1
‘ we try to be a reasonable dad , ’ he said			0
we ? as in ‘ we are a grandmother ’ ( copyright @entity333 1989 ) ? @entity4 cooed			1
her laughter tinkled like the @entity335			0
one of her eyeballs swelled			0
@entity337 , sweetheart , look out !			0

@entity37 *agreed* to have a camera attached to his body for a video
it allowed us to see what it was like to walk as prime minister at @entity195
@entity349 seen him licking mayonnaise off spoon and making sardines on toast
when he opened the fridge we copped a sight of a fair few bottles of vino
he was interviewed in home by @entity4 for @entity5 yesterday morning
