extravagant : @entity0 and @entity1 held one of the most expensive weddings in recent history she first made a name for herself by donating money to the @entity8 party , just as her controversial billionaire father did in the past			1
but there was nothing conservative about @entity1 's multimillion - pound wedding at @entity15 's @entity14 this weekend			2
in scenes that defied @entity20 's austerity policies , the 26 - year - old @entity17 - based socialite staged one of the most expensive marriage celebrations in recent history			2
the lavish affair was attended by senior conservatives including international development minister @entity25 , at the palace that was once home to @entity15 ’s notoriously spendthrift kings			2
miss @entity1 ’s wedding to fellow pr worker @entity0 , 27 , featured a two - hour live performance by pop star @entity31 and a 15ft - high tiered cake			1
aamong the 700 @entity34 guests were the @entity35 and her daughters , the @entity37 and @entity38 , princess @entity39 , sir @entity41 , @entity8 grandee @entity42 , hotelier sir @entity43 and his family , @entity46 ’s mother , @entity47 , and @entity49 ’s boss @entity48			1
it was paid for by 72 - year - old tycoon @entity51 , a close friend of @entity52 and one of the @entity55 ' most prominent financial backers before being linked with a shady arms deal			1
those who accuse mr @entity20 of being an out - of - touch member of the upper classes will also have raised an eyebrow at the presence of his mother - in - law , @entity62			2
her daughter , @entity46 , frequently tries to play down the family ’s privileged background , as does @entity67 - educated mr @entity20			2
mr @entity51 ’s donations were banned during a sleaze crackdown because he was not deemed to be a @entity34 resident , but in 2005 miss @entity1 was recorded as giving £ 47,000 to the conservatives			2
then a teenager , she would not have had enough money for the donation , prompting claims that she had unlawfully acted as a ‘ proxy ’ to her father			0
but the @entity8 said it was a clerical error , and that the money had come from @entity78 , miss @entity1 ’s @entity34 mother			1
an enquiry carried out by the @entity80 found there had been no wrongdoing , and miss @entity1 remains a @entity8 supporter			1
on saturday her family and friends filled @entity14 , the palace most commonly associated with the @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity89 @entity88			0
the monarchs ’ high living cost them their heads during the @entity94 , but this weekend 's guests had no thought of anything spoiling their merriment as they tucked into a cordon bleu vintage banquet in a resplendent state room			1
dressed in black tie and ball gowns , they filed through the world famous @entity104 , where the @entity106 was signed to officially end @entity107 in 1919			0
on saturday evening , the revellers were serenaded in the manicured @entity110 gardens by @entity31 – a singer who is unlikely to provide a private performance for less than £ 1million			1
‘ it was an incredible celebration – one that could n’t be more luxurious , ’ said one of the guests			1
‘ many of the guests were so rich they arrived by private jets , but even they were surprised by how lavish the whole thing was			1
' the whole thing would have cost many millions			0
people came from all over the world , but there were plenty of @entity8 supporters from @entity127			1
’ opulent surroundings : revellers at the @entity14 feasted on a cordon bleu banquet and were serenaded by @entity31 in the manicured @entity110 gardens speaking about her big day earlier this year , miss @entity1 said modestly : ‘ we want to keep it very private			1
it is an occasion just for our family and friends ’ , but this did not stop well - connected friends posting pictures on social media sites which can be viewed by the general public			0
these included pictures of the couple preparing to be married , and a photograph of their huge cake			0
as well as hiring out @entity14 , mr @entity51 organised a pre-wedding celebration and dinner at the @entity149 on friday night , filling it with fresh flowers and dancing ballerinas in honour of his only daughter			0
he had originally wanted the wedding to take place in @entity156 , where he was born , but the ongoing revolution in @entity158 made this impossible			0
the entire extravaganza in @entity15 rivalled the celebrations of another of @entity34 ’s richest men , steel magnate @entity163 , whose daughter @entity165 married at @entity14 seven years ago			0
mr @entity51 , who sold a collection of the @entity168 ’s jewels for almost £ 8million in 2010 , spared no expense for @entity170 - educated miss @entity1 and her new husband , a trainee at @entity173 ’s pr conglomerate , @entity172			0
famous faces : @entity78 and @entity51 , @entity1 's parents , welcomed notable figures including international development minister @entity25 , right , to the high - profile wedding despite this , guests were instructed on wedding invitations : ‘ your presence is enough but if you want to buy us a gift we are registered at @entity184			2
’ the @entity51 family are based in @entity186 for tax reasons , but also divide their time between homes in @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity17 ’s @entity193 , as well as a £ 50million @entity195 estate			0
mr @entity51 admits that he played a ‘ small ’ role in the controversial 1986 @entity198 deal which saw @entity192 buy £ 40billion worth of fighter planes from the @entity34 amid allegations of bribery			1
as well as @entity52 and her son @entity203 , close personal friends include numerous other senior conservative politicians and former @entity206 minister @entity205			0
mr @entity51 gave £ 25million to @entity207 in 1996 to found the @entity208 , and now travels the world in his own @entity210 , making business ' deals behind the scenes ’			0
mr @entity25 confirmed he was at the wedding , while @entity215 said they ‘ were n’t going to deny ’ that @entity47 was there too .			0
