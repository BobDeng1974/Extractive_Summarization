by @entity0 more than 7.5 million children aged under 13 lie to get around @entity3 ’s age restrictions			1
in 2012 , the social network filed a patent that would make this process more legitimate , by seeking approval from , and handing the controls of the account to , the child ’s parent			1
but this application was only made public last week , and has caused uproar among children 's rights campaigners			1
the application went public this week			0
@entity3 told @entity22 ' a patent is not a predicator for future work ' and denied the age limit was changing			1
stock image pictured @entity28 , chief executive of child - advocacy group @entity29 said : ' we do n't have the proper science and social research to evaluate the potential pros and cons that social - media platforms are doing to teenagers			0
according to the files ( pictured ) , if an underage user tried to access the site , @entity3 would ask for ' parental authorisation ' via an existing account ' the idea that you would go after this segment of the audience when there are concerns about the current audience is mind boggling			1
' according to the patent , when an underage user tries to access the site , or ‘ perform actions ’ on it , @entity3 will ask for ‘ parental authorisation from an additional user having a parental relationship to the user ’			2
the child would tell @entity3 who their parents are before the site runs a validity check on the parent ’s account to confirm the relationship , and the age of the user			1
‘ the online service may make these verifications based in part social and transactional information associated with the identified user 's account , ’ explained the files			2
‘ upon successful verification , the online service allows the identified user to authorise account creation for the child user , and / or manage the account and actions of the child user			0
’ this means that once an underage account had been linked to a parental one , the adults would be able to limit and monitor their child ’s behaviour			1
they would also have complete control of the child 's privacy and applications on the site			1
@entity3 has denied it is planning to launch the service , and told the @entity22 : ‘ child safety advocates , policymakers and companies have discussed how best to help parents keep their kids safe online			2
the original age limit was set to comply with the 1998 @entity102 ( @entity102 )			0
any changes would need to be approved by governing body , the @entity105			0
the site was criticised in october for allowing teenagers to make public posts ( pictured ) @entity3 was criticised in october for letting teenagers make their posts public			2
before the update @entity3 prevented under 18s making posts public ; the widest audience they could reach was @entity116			2
in a blog post , @entity3 said : ' teens are among the savviest people using social media , and whether it comes to civic engagement , activism , or their thoughts on a new movie , they want to be heard			0
' so , starting today , people aged 13 through 17 will also have the choice to post publicly on @entity3			0
' ‘ like any responsible company , we looked at ways to tackle this issue , but a patent application based on two - year - old research is not a predictor of future work in this area			1
’ the patent was filed in 2012 , at the same time @entity3 was researching how many underage children access the site			1
this research was carried out after a number of child safety advocates voiced concerns about the number of children using the site			0
a @entity145 at the time found more than 5 million children under the age of 10 were accessing @entity3 and its apps and this figure is said to have held steady ever since			2
the original under - 13 age limit was set to comply with the 1998 @entity102 ( @entity102 )			0
this act requires any companies that handle data of young children to get explicit parental consent			0
any changes to this element of @entity3 ’s terms and conditions would need to be approved by governing body , the @entity105 .			0

@entity3 filed the patent in 2012 , but it was made public on *thursday*
the current age *threshold* on the social network is 13 years old
files *detail* how an underage child could open an account with their parent ’s approval
this involves authenticating and linking accounts held by the parents
parents would then be able to limit and monitor their child ’s behaviour
they would also have complete control over privacy and applications
@entity3 said a patent application is ' not a predicator of future work '
