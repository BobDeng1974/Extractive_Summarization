it comes after his wife , @entity29 was diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth of their third child			2
but after taking up exercising , she won the battle and ' returned back to her former self			0
' the @entity9 man started his own campaign ' 52 events in 52 weeks ' in a bid to raise awareness and funds ' the exercise got her off the medication and it brought her back to normal , ' @entity2 told @entity48			1
' it was a really difficult few years and she tried everything to alleviate but i 'm so glad that by reaching out for support , she was able to begin a long journey of recovery and take back control of her life			2
' for this reason , i felt compelled to do something physical to support beyondblue and promote keeping active and staying healthy			0

' it 's been challenging trying to coordinate everything such as our businesses and not missing out on too much of the kids ' activities but the most challenging part was the 50 kilometre stand - up paddle board			2
' ' i 'm hoping to carry the event on again next year and inspire everyone to get together and help them achieve that goal			0

' @entity2 added : ' my advice to anyone who has experienced the impact of depression that it has on the person , family and friends - all you can do is really support them			1

' for most of us , completing one endurance event in a year , such as a marathon , would be a major accomplishment			0
to do one every week for a year is nothing short of remarkable , ' she said			0
' at least one in seven women will experience postnatal depression , and anxiety conditions are thought to be at least as common as depression during this time			0
' by speaking openly about anxiety and depression , particularly postnatal depression and how it affects families , @entity2 has been helping to break down the stigma surrounding these conditions , which stops many people from taking action when they are struggling			2
