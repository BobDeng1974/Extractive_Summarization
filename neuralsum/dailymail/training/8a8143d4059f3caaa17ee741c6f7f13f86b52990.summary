shoot alors ! a @entity2 assault craft approaches a beach at @entity24 in @entity13 large fleet : hundreds of troops stormed the beach along with 43 vehicles , four helicopters , two landing craft and a catamaran closer relations : the is the first time @entity2 troops have trained using a beach in the @entity5 but far from being a serious assault on the scale of a @entity39 invasion , this was a unique training exercise for the @entity2 military			1

the task force landed at @entity56 in @entity12 , @entity13 , which was part - built by @entity2 prisoners of war during the early 19th century			1
working together : the training exercise comes after @entity5 and @entity2 signed a defence treaty in 2010 training : armoured cars drive on the beach after a catamaran brought them ashore during the exercise ready for battle : this scene would have been a nightmare for admiral @entity17 who spent his life protecting @entity5 's shores the amphibious landing helicopter ship , @entity73 , and its anti-submarine warfare destroyer , @entity75 , conducted exercises out in the @entity77 from 2pm while aircraft buzzed in the grey skies overhead			1
speaking ahead of the invasion , a @entity2 navy spokeswoman said : ' once the vehicles and soldiers disembark , using the landing craft and helicopters , the troops will continue with instruction activities , driver training , live fire exercises and assault course on @entity24			1
' this kind of manoeuvre is a unique chance for the 134 midshipmen of the @entity96 2010 - class embarked onboard the @entity73 and the @entity97 to discover both amphibious and joint operations			0
' after their stay on the south coast , the roving task force will travel to the @entity102 and the @entity103 , where they will take part in an @entity107 anti-piracy operation before visiting @entity109 waters			0
armed and ready : the troops took part in driver training , live fire exercises and had to complete an assault course at @entity24 camp @entity117 le bleu : the naval force spent the day training at the @entity24 camp in @entity12 , @entity13 , which was part - built by @entity2 prisoners of war during the early 19th century the last time @entity2 troops landed on @entity5 soil was during the @entity43 - also known as the ' last invasion of @entity5 ' - in 1797			1
the invasion was the plan of @entity2 general @entity129 , who had devised a three - pronged attack on @entity5 in support of @entity132 under @entity133			2
two forces would land in @entity5 as a diversionary effort , while the main body would land in @entity137			0
while poor weather and indiscipline halted two of the forces , the third , aimed at landing in @entity142 and marching on @entity143 , went ahead			0
the invasion force consisted of 1,400 troops from the @entity146 ( @entity147 ) under the command of @entity150 colonel @entity149 , 800 of whom were irregulars			0

the remaining troops were met by a quickly assembled group of around 500 @entity5 reservists , militia and sailors under the command of @entity170 , 1st @entity171			2
