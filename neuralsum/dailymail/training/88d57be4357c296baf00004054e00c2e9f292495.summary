by @entity0 last updated at 5:59 pm on 23rd september 2011 @entity3 's cities are so polluted they pose a serious health risk to their millions of residents for 135 ' smog days ' a year , experts have revealed			2
@entity10 's worst , the @entity8 area and @entity9 , also had 27 ' red alert ' days in 2010 where air quality was so bad healthy people could develop breathing difficulties or even have a heart attack			1
a new environmental study has ranked every @entity10 metropolitan area by smog and @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 make up the rest of the top five , followed by @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , and @entity27			1
toxic : the skylines of @entity9 , pictured above , and @entity23 , pictured below , both shrouded in a thick cloud of smog			1
the millions of residents in both cities had dozens of days where they were breathing dangerous levels of ozone last year in total the five worst cities , with more than 25 million residents between them , had 274 smog days combined last year			1
as set out in the @entity44 , a smog day is when ozone was within the range of 60 to 70 parts per billion of air for more than eight hours			1
it becomes a red alert day when it exceeds that range			2
controversially the @entity53 administration was going to consider lowering these levels this month to improve standards , but has now shelved it for two years			0
@entity57 , who have published the data , also say 48 per cent of all @entity10 live in areas with unhealthy levels of smog pollution			0
@entity63 ' @entity10 deserve clean air			2
but on far too many days , people all across the country are exposed to dangerous smog pollution , ' a spokesman said			2
' pollution from power plants and vehicles puts the health of our nation ’s children and families at risk			0
' studies show that on days with high concentrations of smog pollution in the air , children and adults suffer more asthma attacks , increased respiratory difficulty , and reduced lung function			2
exposure to smog pollution can exacerbate respiratory illness and even cause premature death			0
' childhood asthma : more than 165,000 children in @entity9 alone have the condition the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) set the national standard for smog based on the latest science on air quality and public health			1
but the @entity92 's own independent scientists say the current standard , set in 2008 , does not adequately protect public health			0
as a result , @entity57 's report says people nationwide have been ' exposed to days of poor air quality each summer without even knowing it			1
' a state by state comparison has also been carried out with @entity3 dominating with 135 days smog days in 2010 , more than a third of the year			0
@entity3 @entity110 @entity109 said the report ' confirms what we already know , ' but that this was unacceptable			0
' in @entity9 , we know that smog is a major threat to the health of our families			1
over 700,000 people in our city suffer from asthma , including 165,000 children , ' she said			0
@entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 each had at least 30 of these days in 2010			0
seventeen states experienced at least one “ red alert ” day for unhealthy air , indicating pollution levels high enough in a particular area so that anyone could start experiencing adverse health effects			1
and only nine states did not record any days in 2010 on which levels of smog pollution exceeded the standard , which were @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 .			0

the @entity8 area and @entity9 have the worst air quality in the country
