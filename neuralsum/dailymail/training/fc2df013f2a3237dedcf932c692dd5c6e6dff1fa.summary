adorable : this rat settles down with some cuddly friends for afternoon tea and cake , in one of a series of cute photographs taken by @entity16 photographer @entity15 say cheese ! this furry friend is off on a little trip in a @entity25 out for a stroll : this rat poses with a pram @entity42 , 54 , said : ' i never used to like rats , but one day i went to a pet shop and there was one left that no - one wanted to buy because it was a funny colour			1
' i felt so sorry for it , i had to take it home			0
i then bought a friend for it and i 've loved the rats ever since			0
' they 're such friendly and intelligent animals and so often misunderstood			0
' doing the maths : this rat has a talent for number crunching ready for winter : in another photo , one of the rats knits something warm sound and vision : one of the rats spends her time in front of the television she then combined her new pets with her passion for photography to get the perfect poses			1
' it seemed only natural to take pictures of my rats			2
i started buying props for the rats and as they 're inquisitive animals , it was n't long before they started picking them up			2
' i have a big imagination so often think of ideas for new photos			0
i use vanilla pudding on the props , on the handle of the knitting needle for example and that helps show the rats how to use the props			2
in the tub : it 's bath time for this little rodent tender moment : a lovely kiss for this cuddly toy papa - rat - zi : the tables are turned in this pic as the rat turns snapper ' they 're so clever , they soon know exactly what to do			0
it 's fun to photograph them as they look really cute			0
' my new favourite image is the one of both my rats eating birthday cake together - they really look like they 're enjoying it			0
