@entity1 's 30th birthday is a day she will never forget but not for the reasons you might expect			1
at 20 weeks pregnant , it was also the day @entity1 , now 31 , discovered her unborn daughter @entity5 had a congenital heart disease and would need open heart surgery as soon as she was born			1
with no history of the condition in the family the unexpected news left @entity1 and her partner @entity12 , 30 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , devastated , and @entity1 vowed to do everything she could to ensure her daughter had the best start in life			1
' none of this affected the baby while it was inside me but once the baby was delivered they would n't be able to get enough oxygen			0
' @entity1 and @entity12 's baby had transposition of the great arteries , a rare heart defect in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed			1
because of the shock diagnosis the couple decided to find out the sex of their unborn baby , which they had planned to keep a surprise			0
' i felt like we needed to know her sex			0
i needed to feel something positive and connect with her			0
we did n't need any more surprises , ' first time mum said			0
the diagnosis meant that @entity5 would need open heart surgery to switch the arteries back to their correct position as soon as she was born			1
@entity5 had open heart surgery when she was just ten days old in an eight - hour operation to swap arteries @entity5 with proud parents @entity1 and dad @entity12 , a tattoo artist ' it 's so easy to take it for granted when you have a healthy baby			1
when you find out there 's a problem with your baby that will require medical intervention you want to do anything you can to make it better			0
' so when @entity1 attended @entity76 's @entity75 in february 2014 and came across stem cell banking company @entity77 , she realised the procedure could prove priceless			1
stem cells are found in the cord blood that remains in the placenta and umbilical cord , which are usually thrown away , after a baby is born			1
the stem cells are an exact dna match to the baby and can help cure many life threatening diseases , such as leukaemia and sickle cell disease			1
although stem cell banking is popular in @entity93 there are currently only four @entity95 hospitals in the @entity96 offering the service			0
new parents – including @entity100 presenter @entity99 who gave birth to her first child @entity102 in january - are using private stem cell banking companies instead			2
@entity1 said : ' we were going to look for a crib and a pram and came away with information about stem cell banking			1
' @entity1 feels comforted by knowing her daughter 's precious stem cells will be there for her until she 's 30 the family poses for a snap , with @entity5 , who wears a pacemaker to regulate her heart , grinning at the camera ' there are so many different things that can be done with stem cells			1
doctors are creating better and new ways of doing things all the time , and we realised this could help our baby when she 's older			0
it could also protect any future children we have			0
' but with a price tag of more than £ 2,000 the procedure was way out of @entity1 and tattoo artist @entity12 's price range			1
luckily for @entity132 was running a competition offering parents - to - be the chance to win free banking by explaining what the prize would mean to their family on the company 's facebook page			0
so @entity1 – who until then had never won anything in her life - relayed her story and was stunned when she was chosen as the winner			2
the couple were given a box containing a special bag in which the cord blood could be stored , and the number of a phlebotomist who would come to the hospital and harvest the blood as soon as @entity5 was delivered			1
' we had to call the number as soon as i went into labour and keep them updated on progress , ' said @entity1 , who was two weeks overdue when she finally went into labour in june last year			2
but because @entity5 's heart rate kept dropping she was born by emergency caesarean at @entity162 in @entity163 after a 36 - hour labour , weighing a healthy 7lb 2oz			1
' the phlebotomist was in the delivery room with us and she collected the cord blood and placenta straight away			2
she went into a separate room , took everything she needed and put it into a special bag			0
then i was given the box back with the bag inside , and we had to call a courier to come and collect it			0
' @entity1 says of @entity5 : ' we do n't know what the future holds for us and the stem cells could help her heart condition in the future ' @entity1 had her daughter 's stem cells harvested through precious cells the courier arrived within hours of @entity5 's birth to collect the stem cells , which have now been cryogenically frozen by @entity77 at their bio bank in @entity76 for 30 years			1
' there are all sorts of certificates and insurance policies in case something happens to the storage facility or the company goes out of business , ' says @entity1			2
@entity5 was immediately transferred to @entity200 where she underwent full open heart surgery in an eight - hour operation to swap the arteries in her heart when she was ten days old			2
' it was a very traumatic , stressful and emotional time , ' @entity1 said			0
' i would n't wish it on my worst enemy			0
' the surgery was a success and 10 days later @entity5 was fitted with a pacemaker to regulate her heart beat			2
at four weeks old @entity1 and @entity12 were finally able to take their daughter home , and although she will require life - long care she is now a happy and healthy eight - month - old baby			2
' babies who have undergone heart surgery can never have a normal heart again			0
they have a repaired heart , ' said @entity1			2
' we do n't know what the future holds for us and the stem cells could help her heart condition in the future			1
' ' sometimes i forget we have the stem cells banked , and then i remember and feel relief			1
it 's an insurance policy for the future , just in case			0
if we do n't end up using it i will find out whether we can donate it			0
' @entity238 presenter @entity99 used a private stem cell banking company after having her first baby @entity102 in january			0

@entity1 's daughter @entity5 was born with congenital heart disease
mum from @entity13 had blood from @entity5 's cord harvested at birth
