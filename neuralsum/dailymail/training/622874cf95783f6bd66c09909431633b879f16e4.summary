some 19 per cent of people now say they will back @entity9 ’s party , twice the level seen early last year			1
mr @entity9 last night said the @entity11 should be told to ‘ get stuffed ’ and said the demand had been a ' gift ' to his party			1
the rise of @entity0 has come at the expense of both the main parties , with @entity18 slumped at the lowest level of support since @entity21 became leader			1
@entity0 has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a @entity27 telephone poll in june the new @entity27 survey for @entity29 puts @entity18 neck and neck with the @entity32 on 30 per cent			1
it means mr @entity21 has dropped five points in just a month , his worst rating ever as leader			0
at the same time backing for @entity0 has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a @entity27 telephone poll in june			1

@entity0 appears to have been bolstered by the huge row over the demand that @entity6 pays an extra £ 1.7billion to the @entity11 by december 1			1
@entity9 said the demand for an extra £ 1.7billion from @entity5 had been a ' gift ' to @entity0 @entity21 has seen support for @entity18 slump to its lowest level since he became leader , and is now neck and neck with @entity50 's @entity32 on 30 per cent @entity50 yesterday insisted he will not meet the deadline , but suggested @entity6 could end up handing over hundreds of millions of pounds			1
he told @entity52 that the row had undermined public support for the @entity11			2

however mr @entity9 said he would tell the @entity11 to “ get stuffed quite frankly ”			2
he told @entity62 ’s @entity61 : ‘ quite honestly politically it 's a gift to @entity0 … the prime minister was very clear			2
‘ we will not be paying this money before the first of december			0
‘ what he really means is they wo n't pay it until after the @entity72 by - election			0
then we will pay it because those are the rules of the club			0
‘ either we abide by those rules or we say the club 's not for us … i would n't pay it today			0
’ budget commissioner @entity78 said it would be ' extremely difficult ' for the prime minister to challenge the @entity11 's demand for extra cash			2
mr @entity78 said the move risked opening a ' @entity84 ' which could put the future of the @entity6 's £ 3billion - a - year rebate in question			0
but in a statement to the @entity89 this afternoon mr @entity50 said : ‘ @entity6 will not be paying two billion euros to anyone on december 1 and we reject this scale of payment			0
