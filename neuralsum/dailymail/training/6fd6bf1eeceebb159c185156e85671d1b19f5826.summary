@entity0 are facing a £ 49million fine from @entity2 and savage @entity4 sanctions that could keep up to four of their stars out of @entity2 next season			1
@entity0 were fighting their punishment for breaching @entity2 ’s financial fair play regulations on tuesday night			1
they are understood to have until the end of the week to accept the ‘ settlement ’ from @entity2 or their case will be passed to a panel which has the ultimate power to kick them out of the @entity4			1
the situation is embarrassing for shock : @entity0 are to be hit with a £ 49million fine and a squad restriction for breaching @entity22 rules limitations : @entity24 may not be able to put all his players in his @entity27 squad due to the salary cap goalkeepers : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32			1
defenders : @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42			0
midfielders : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51			0
forwards : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56			0
business as usual ? @entity35 signs eautographs outside the @entity59 on tuesday city and their @entity62 owners as @entity24 ’s side attempt to take a step closer to the @entity66 title when they face @entity68 at the @entity59 tonight			2
the proposed fine is a significant sum even by the standards of @entity72 but it is the @entity4 sanctions that threaten to hit the club hardest			1
city face seeing their @entity4 squad cut from 25 players to 21 , as well as having a @entity27 salary cap imposed on them next season			1
while their ‘ homegrown ’ quota of eight players would remain the same , @entity2 have proposed cutting their foreign contingent from 17 to 13			2
that could threaten the participation of some of the club ’s big names and even have an impact on @entity24 ’s transfer plans for this summer			0
all five of his signings last summer were foreign , as are his main targets for next season			0
@entity0 might also have to reassess plans to let go of some of their homegrown players			2
@entity101 and @entity37 are expected to leave at the end of their contracts , while @entity34 , @entity48 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity42 and @entity107 face uncertain futures			0
city are one of nine teams being punished over @entity22 breaches			0
club sources last night urged caution , saying reports of the sanctions are premature and speculative			2
@entity2 president @entity117 has said in the past that teams will not be kicked out of the @entity4 , but the possibility remains if @entity0 fight the measures handed down			1
@entity24 said : ‘ when it is official news we can analyse what happens with the team			0
at the moment we do n’t know what happens			0
’ it is understood @entity130 are facing similar sanctions to @entity0 , and their coach @entity132 admitted that the measures would mean the club ‘ wo n’t be able to do everything it wants ’ in the @entity4 next season			1
the issue cast a cloud over @entity0 ’s preparations for tonight ’s game , with @entity0 effectively needing four points from their remaining two games at home to @entity68 and @entity145 to secure the club ’s second title in three years			1
@entity24 said : ‘ we are not thinking about any draws			0
we are thinking about beating @entity68 , then we ’ll see about the next game			0
’ @entity55 will miss the game after limping out of saturday ’s 3 - 2 win at @entity151			0
the @entity22 , first agreed in principle in september 2009 by the @entity153 of @entity2 , were brought in to prevent professional football clubs spending more than they earn in the pursuit of success and in doing so getting into financial problems which might threaten their long - term survival			1
introduced amid concern at the heavy spending of a number of professional clubs across @entity2 , it was hoped that the regulations would eventually lead to a more ‘ level playing field ’ by preventing clubs with very wealthy owners who make substantial cash gifts to their club from gaining an unfair advantage over other clubs who are run on a more sustainable business model , and in so doing encourage lower levels of spending			2
the financial fair play ( @entity22 ) regulations provide for sanctions to be taken against clubs who do not spend within a set budgetary framework over several seasons			1
