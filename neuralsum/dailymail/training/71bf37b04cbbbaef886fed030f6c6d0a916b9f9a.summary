so it came as no surprise to see @entity11 pedalling around @entity12 on a hybrid bike today			1
not for @entity11 the trendy single speed or sit - up - and - beg styles that have become so prevalent among @entity17 and @entity18			0
@entity11 was sure to put safety first as she pedalled around @entity12 today wearing a safety helmet and high visibility band the 41 - year - old prime minister 's wife was riding a @entity25 hybrid - a simple aluminium - framed bike with 24 gears with slender tyres making it suited to road cycling but more robust than a racer bike			1
@entity25 hybrid bikes sell at @entity34 and similar cycle stores for around Â£ 300 , depending on the model			1
and sensible @entity11 was sure to wear suitable clothing for the outing - her navy wool coat , dark jeans and patent brogues were accessorised with a @entity43 safety helmet and high visibility band			0
she 's passed her cycling proficiency test ! @entity11 gave clear hand signals as she cycled around the central @entity48 postcode this morning @entity11 dressed sensibly for the cool autumn morning , wearing a navy wool coat , dark jeans and patent brogues @entity51 carried her essentials in a handy cross-body messenger bag while going about her business @entity11 is a keen exercise fan and is frequently seen jogging or cycling near her @entity3 home			2
she is also said to have personal pilates lessons at @entity5 a @entity25 hybrid , similar to @entity11 's , on sale at @entity34 @entity34 describe a bike in a similar style to @entity11 's as a hybrid			1
they say : ' @entity64 has all the attributes of the tough lithium category with @entity68 v - brakes to reduce overall weight and cost without any lack of stopping power			0
' @entity74 7 - speed gearing is totally reliable and the wheels are proven @entity76 , rims that shrug off rough road surfaces much better than most			0
' for added comfort , a narrower handlebar , shorter stem and cranks and women 's saddle finish off the package ' with big wheels and an attitude , the lithium is a fast and light weight women 's city ride with a heavyweight character			2
it 's based on a rigid 29er @entity68 layout for a confident and comfortable fit for a female rider , designed with handling that suits the cut - n - paste of city short - cuts and emergency manoeuvres			2
' tough tyres , deep - section rims and a steel fork add to the security you 'll feel from behind the wide riser bar , while reflective frame decals help you stay visible in dimly - lit areas			0
' it 's a true hybrid with the best elements of 29 " mtbs and 700c urban genres rolled into one bike			1
