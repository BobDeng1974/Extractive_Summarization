the leaders of @entity2 's seven main political parties went head - to - head in an unprecedented tv debate on thursday as the nation prepares for this year 's general election			2
nobody is expected to win a majority when votes are cast on may 7 in what is being touted as the closest and most unpredictable race since the 1970s			1
prime minister @entity12 , of the @entity13 , narrowly topped the polls assessing who ' won ' the two - hour clash against six other parties in an unusual format for @entity2			1
crucially , 33 per cent of the 7.4 million viewers hailed @entity12 as ' the most impressive ' on the subject of the economy , which lies at the heart of each party 's campaign			1
but pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be @entity12 or the @entity27 's @entity26 who takes the top job in an inevitable coalition after votes are cast			1
it comes six weeks ahead of the general election on may 7 neck - and - neck : @entity12 was hailed as statesmanlike in the debate as he tries to edge out @entity26 ( right ) @entity41 , of the pro-independence @entity42 ( @entity42 ) , was widely touted as one of the victors in the debate , which also featured the environment - focused @entity46 , led by @entity48 , and @entity50 ' @entity49 , led by @entity51			2
deputy prime minister @entity52 , leader of the @entity54 , and @entity55 of the @entity2 @entity56 completed the line - up			1
analysts remarked that none of the leaders managed to deliver a ' killer line ' that would set them apart from the other participants			2
' there was clearly no knock - out blow , ' said @entity66 of pollster @entity67			0
@entity69 , 17 , who asked one of the questions on the night , said afterwards : ' some performed well in answer to certain questions , other performed well on different subjects , but there was no definitive winner			0
' a rare moment of drama came when a female audience member briefly interrupted @entity12 to complain about the number of homeless people sleeping in the streets			0
too close to call ? pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be the @entity27 's @entity26 ( left ) or @entity12 ( right ) in the top job after votes are cast			0
but polls named @entity12 as last night 's debate ' winner ' range : @entity41 , leader of the pro-independence @entity42 , was touted as one of the victors			0
analysts remarked that none of the seven leaders delivered a ' killer line ' to stand out from the rest rare moment of drama : a woman stood up during the debate to heckle @entity12 about homelessness but in a result that will calm @entity106 nerves , a @entity103 / @entity102 poll showed 40 per cent of voters asked afterwards judged @entity12 was the most capable of leading @entity2 , compared to 28 per cent who named @entity26			1
the event was the first and only full tv debate of a campaign that has yet to stir voters , many of whom say they feel jaded despite a rising economy			0
it is the only time @entity12 and @entity26 will go head - to - head on issues of policy before votes are cast			0
in one of @entity12 's more animated moments in an otherwise reserved performance , he pointed to his rivals , one - by - one , and said : ' what i 'm hearing is more debt and more taxes , more debt and more taxes , a lot more debt and more taxes , some more debt and more taxes , and definitely more debt and more taxes			0
' deputy prime minister @entity52 was forced to reference mistakes he made in the last five years in coalition hot topics : immigration divided leaders , as the @entity2 @entity56 leader @entity55 ( pictured ) insisted @entity2 will have to leave the @entity143 in order to have control over the nation 's borders			1

prime minister @entity12 *faced* six other party leaders
none of the leaders are expected to land a majority in the may 7 election
no leader delivered ' killer line ' but he was ' most impressive ' on economy
pollsters touting this election as closest since 1970s , inevitable coalition
