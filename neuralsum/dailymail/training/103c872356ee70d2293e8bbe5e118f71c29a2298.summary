if you have ever walked out of a shop laden with bags of treats that you did n’t really need , you may have fallen for one of many marketing tricks designed to make you part with your hard - earned money			2
rounded prices and shops with ‘ warm ’ scents like cinnamon , encourage shoppers to buy products led by their emotions , according to a group of new studies			1
one of them found that colourful adverts make consumers increasingly likely to spend money on more expensive , frivolous items , than monochrome ones			1
scientists have revealed that subtly changing how a shop smells , rounding up prices for emotion - led purchases such as clothing ( illustrated with a stock image ) and using colourful adverts , can encourage shoppers to buy products , including luxurious items researchers from the @entity36 , the @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 have shown for the first time that the ‘ temperature ’ of scents used in shops affect how much customers buy			1
‘ people smelling warm fragrances such as cinnamon feel that the room they are in is more crowded , and feel less powerful as a result , ’ they said			1
‘ this can lead them to compensate by buying items they feel are more prestigious			0
’ they conducted several experiments to test how warm and cool scents affect consumer perception and decision - making , which were detailed in the @entity56			2
a team of researchers showed that ' warm ' scents such as cinnamon ( pictured ) make consumers feel like they are in more crowded shops and feel less powerful as a result			1
they found that in such an environment , shoppers were likely to compensate for their lack of power by buying more items , including luxury products researchers in @entity72 revealed that rounded numbers such as £ 50 appeal to people who are making emotion - led purchases , such as a camera for their holiday			1
rounded prices encourage shoppers to rely on their feelings , rather than evaluating products , making them perfect for products for holidays , frivolous fashion items and even houses			1
however , non-rounded prices , such as £ 98.76 , make consumers more likely to buy utilitarian items , such as a camera to use for a school project , appliances or cleaning products			1
the experts said that companies should be aware that small changes in pricing can have a big impact			0
when people in a room experienced a ‘ warm ’ scent such as cinnamon , they felt the room was more crowded than when they experienced a ‘ cool ’ scent - even though the room contained the same number of people each time			2
the people in the ‘ warm , crowded ’ room felt less powerful as a result of the perceived crowding , and were more likely to compensate for this loss of power by buying items , which they felt were luxurious and helped raise their personal status , the researchers explained			1
shoppers in the warm - scented shop also bought significantly more items overall			0
this is despite the fact that the temperature was never increased			0
the scientists believe that their study shows how retailers can easily encourage people to buy more high - end items , just by changing fragrance			1
similarly , a study published in the @entity130 found that rounded numbers such as £ 50 appeal to shoppers and make them more likely to buy ‘ emotional ’ products , than if they are priced at £ 49.99 , for example			1
‘ a rounded price - $ 100 - encourages consumers to rely on feelings when evaluating products , while a non-rounded price - $ 98.76 - encourages consumers to rely on reason , ’ researchers @entity137 of @entity138 , @entity72 and @entity139 of @entity140 said			1
‘ when a purchase is driven by feelings , rounded prices lead to a subjective experience of feeling right			0
’ a study published in the @entity130 found that rounded numbers such as £ 50 appeal to shoppers and make them more likely to buy ‘ emotional ’ products such as clothing ( illustrated with a stock image ) , than if they are priced at £ 49.99 , for example five studies revealed that rounded prices make consumers more likely to buy a product when a purchase is primarily driven by feelings , such as buying a camera for a family holiday			1
however , non-rounded prices ( $ 98.76 ) make consumers more likely to buy the same product when a purchase is utilitarian , such as buying a camera to use for a school project			2
the experts said that companies should be aware that small changes in pricing can have a big impact , so that products for holidays , frivolous fashion items and even houses could benefit from rounded prices			2
meanwhile , companies selling practical products such as appliances and cleaning products could benefit from precise prices such as £ 29.58 , for example			2
another study , published in the @entity130 , said that when it comes to getting consumers to part with more of their cash , colourful adverts are more effective than monochrome ones			1
‘ black - and - white images can lead consumers to focus on the abstract , essential , and defining components of a product , ’ according to a group of researchers at @entity198			1
treating yourself to a coveted gadget or luxurious item of clothing after a break - up may seem like a good idea , but a new study claims that so - called retail therapy makes people dwell on their failure			2
a joint study by the @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 found that consumers who buy premium goods after a failure are masking the problem , rather than recovering - and could even make things worse			1
the researchers said : ‘ when consumers experience a psychological threat to how they would like to see themselves , buying products that signal accomplishment in the same area of their life could ironically cause them to dwell on their shortcomings			0
retail therapy woes : a study found that consumers who buy premium goods after a perceived failure , such as a break - up , ( illustrated with a stock image ) are masking the problem , rather than recovering ‘ this can strip consumers of their mental resources and impair their self - control			2
’ the study invited participants to recall a time when their intelligence was undermined and what they did about it			0
it found that those who opted for a form of retail therapy were unhappier in the longer term			0
‘ consumption can sometimes compensate for our blunders and failures , but this does n’t always work , ’ the researchers said			0
‘ consumers who use products to boost their sense of self - worth tend to dwell on their shortcomings and their ability to exert self - control is impaired			0
‘ after experiencing a setback in one area of their life , consumers might be better off boosting their sense of self in a different area of their life			0
‘ for example , a consumer whose intelligence is undermined might be better off signalling their self - worth socially rather than trying to assert their intelligence			0

when it comes to getting consumers to part with more of their cash , colourful adverts ( an example is pictured ) are more effective than monochrome ones , which can lead consumers to focus on practical features @entity287 researchers have shown or the first time that the ‘ temperature ’ of scents used in shops affect how much customers buy			1
' @entity294 ' smalls such as cinnamon make a shop feel more crowded and consumers fell less powerful as a result			2
they explained that this makes shoppers compensate by buying more luxurious items - and more products overall			2
the scientists believe that their study shows how retailers can easily encourage people to buy more high - end items , just by changing fragrance			1
‘ in contrast , colour images can draw attention to the concrete , sometimes unimportant and idiosyncratic features of the product			0
’ in one experiment , consumers were shown either monochrome or colour pictures of four shoes - plain sneakers , leopard print sneakers , plain heels and leopard print heels			0
they were asked to separate them into two groups			0
consumers who saw the black - and - white pictures were more likely to categorise the shoes based on their function – high heels for looking glamorous and sneakers for exercise – instead of separating them by plain versus pattern			0
the study shows that the consumers looking at the monochrome images tended to focus on basic and practical product features			1
consequently , the study suggests that colourful adverts have the power to distract consumers from thinking about practical features , such as a car ’s efficiency , and instead pay more for unnecessary features , such as a flashy stereo			1
‘ colour has become dominant in marketing because it attracts attention and promotes favourable attitudes , ’ they said			0
‘ however , there may be times when companies might prefer to use black - and - white advertising			0
if a product ’s primary features are superior , companies can successfully promote the product by using black - and - white images			0
‘ on the other hand , if a product ’s secondary features are superior , companies should consider using colour images to draw attention to these otherwise easily overlooked features ’ .			0

study shows cinnamon - like scents makes shops feel more crowded and consumers less powerful , so they buy more to compensate
' warm ' smells also cause people to buy more luxurious products
researchers in @entity72 found people are more likely to make emotion - led purchases like clothes , if prices are rounded , such as £ 50
*specific* prices like £ 98.76 appeal to people making practical purchases
colourful adverts are most effective at driving shoppers to spend
@entity198 said monochrome ads make people focus on essential aspects , so they are less likely to upgrade to get frivolous *extras*
