by @entity0 it is the most @entity2 - nominated show of the season			1
but the stars of @entity9 sensation , @entity6 ’s guide @entity4 , have told of their fears the show would close before it won 10 nominations for the prestigious theater awards - including @entity14			1
the musical - which last night dominated the @entity17 , scooping seven gongs - has had a long journey to @entity9 following a string of workshops , out - of - town runs - with the producers even battling a lawsuit			1
and despite winning plaudits from some of @entity29 's toughest critics following its opening night in november , actress @entity25 admits the show soon ' struggled ' to sell tickets , saying : ' there is no @entity35 - we do n't have any huge names			1
she 's pictured with co-stars @entity54 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) on tuesday , may 27 @entity56 - born actress @entity25 , who plays the conniving @entity57 - tells @entity58 : ' we were n't grossing what we needed to , we were struggling until the @entity2 nominations and all the awards			1
' but even then , audiences were going crazy and our producer @entity66 said ' this is going to be a long haul ' , to be honest , the subject matter and the title are a little bit strange ! ' now people are sitting up and taking notice and since our nominations we 've been selling wonderfully			0
' having starred on stage in big hits @entity75 and @entity76 , @entity25 tells how she turned down a show in @entity78 to appear in the workshop for a @entity81 's guide , saying : ' i knew from reading the script years ago i wanted to be part of it , it 's so rewarding to be part of something from the beginning , to see something grow and have this success			2
' i believed in it from the beginning - i knew it had a future or deserved to have one			2
and i decided to take a risk ! ' it took writers @entity98 and @entity100 nearly 10 years to get the show to @entity9			1
it tells a tale set in @entity104 of penniless @entity105 , who upon his mother 's death discovers that he is a long - lost relative of the aristocratic @entity111 family - and is in line to be the next @entity113			2
the only downside is that there ’s eight relatives in front of him , so he decides to murder each @entity120 one by one and claim his rightful fortune			0
the musical is based on the @entity126 novel @entity125 : the @entity127 , published in 1907			0
this book , in turn , was the inspiration for the 1949 film @entity132 , starring sir @entity133			0

pictured from left : @entity144 , @entity54 , @entity43 , @entity25 and @entity135 but in 2010 , the world premiere of @entity6 's guide was delayed because of a lawsuit brought by @entity132 ' rights holders , who claimed the show was based on the film			2

and @entity25 , who plays @entity105 's married , spoiled and narcissist lover , said her husband , sound engineer @entity158 , who is currently working on another @entity9 production if / then with frozen star @entity157 , kept a close eye on the show 's weekly grosses , but said : ' i did n't look ! i wanted to focus on my work			1
' her co-star @entity54 , who plays @entity105 's betrothed , and eventual wife , @entity167 , is nominated for actress in a featured role in a musical			0
last night , she won outstanding featured actress in a musical at the @entity17 , while the show was named outstanding musical			1
and she says she has grown so close to @entity25 that despite the fact they play feuding femme fatales , her first question after being woken up by her husband to learn she had been nominated for a @entity2 was ' what about @entity25 ? ' in the running : @entity183 star @entity182 has received a nod for his role in the revival at the @entity2			2
last night , he shared the prize for outstanding actor in a musical alongside @entity6 's guide star @entity135 most tipped : @entity182 is beloved by @entity2 voters for popularising the awards as the host of the ceremony ( for which he won three @entity195 ) and for his wonderful turn in @entity183 she says : ' we feel like a team - you ca n't have one without the other , so i was very disappointed for @entity25			1
' @entity45 is such a fantastic female role you do n’t see very often , she 's complicated			0
she 's a loveable but devious kind of a women who ’s powerful			0
and @entity54 admitted she had feared the show would close , joking how cast member @entity207 , the second @entity42 in the production , would come off stage every night , sighing : ' well , i do n't think we 're going to be around much longer '			2
' then we started selling out tickets ' , she said			0
now the entire cast have ' all our fingers , toes and eyelashes crossed ' for success at the @entity2 on sunday			1

@entity54 laughed : ' @entity25 and i get the old , slightly lonely dudes waiting for us at the stage door , but @entity43 has all the teenage girls ! ' he has that unique personality of a lot of big sex symbols , so you think he ’s flirting with you ! but he has grown more than anyone in the show and i find that really impressive			2
