it joins the @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 in building its own carrier , which was launched at the @entity13 shipyard in southern @entity15 state			1
however , @entity17 stills needs to be outfitted and extensive trials will be held in 2016 before the carrier is inducted into the @entity1 navy in 2018			2
@entity9 said last november that its £ 280million - a - year aid programme to @entity1 would be halted in 2015 , in light of the country 's booming economy			1
@entity1 has steadily built up its naval capabilities in recent years , spurred by its rivalry with neighboring @entity46 , and the aircraft carrier launch marks another maritime milestone			1
on saturday , @entity1 activated an atomic reactor for its domestically built nuclear submarine			1
the carrier launch comes just six days after @entity52 launched a new ship capable of carrying 14 helicopters at once - although @entity52 officials insisted the giant vessel is an aircraft carrier and said it will not be used to launch military jets			1
the launch marked the end of the first phase of construction			0
the 37,000 tonne @entity17 will now be moved to another dock for further construction			2
@entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 will be able to fly from the vessel when it is complete			0
vice-admiral @entity68 , the vice-chief of @entity69 said the vessel is the ' crowning glory ' of the @entity29 's construction programme			1
maritime giant : @entity17 docked at the @entity74 will be more than 850ft long and have a breadth of 196ft when it is complete @entity77 list : @entity1 now joins a group of just four other countries - the @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 - capable of building an air craft carrier next step : tugboats guide the carrier as it leaves the dock of the @entity13			1
it will be re-docked where it will be outfitted and undergo trials spurred on : @entity1 's rivalry with neighbouring @entity46 has seen it build up its naval capabilities in recent years it is more than five times larger than any other ship built in @entity1			1
once complete the ship will be more than 850ft ( 260m ) long , with a breadth of 196ft ( 60m )			0
the ship 's production work began in november 2006			0
it has been designed by the @entity99			0
vice admiral @entity100 , controller @entity101 and @entity103 , said : ' we have built 6,000 to 7,000 tonnage capacity ships so far			0
' he said they had encountered a number of issues during the first phase of construction			0
vice admiral @entity100 said : ' availability of steel , problems with acquisition of machines were some of them			0
' most of the equipment has gone on board while the weapons have to be inducted			0
it has got ski jump from where aircraft will take off			0
' commodore @entity127 , @entity74 chairman and managing director , said the next phase will include laying of electric cables , ventilation systems and setting up about 2,300 compartments and will take about four years to complete			0
diesel generators and gas turbines , capable of lighting up the whole of @entity13 , have already been installed			0
the @entity1 naval milestone comes amid rising tensions in the region between @entity46 and @entity52			1
warship : @entity52 's new destroyer ' @entity141 ' , which has a flight deck 820ft long ( 250m ) , was unveiled in @entity144 , south of @entity145 , last week @entity141 : @entity52 's naval authorities insist the flat - top destroyer is not an aircraft carrier despite bearing a strong resemblance to the vessel the @entity52 launched its destroyer last week after calls in the country for beefed - up naval and air forces to enable it to enforce its territorial claims against @entity46			1
the 250m vessel , named ' @entity141 ' , is officially labelled a destroyer , although it has a flat top which functions as a flight deck like that on an aircraft carrier			2
the unveiling of the new destroyer - which has been under development since 2009 - also coincides with a dispute between @entity52 and @entity46 over a chain of tiny islands in the @entity169			2
the two countries conduct regular patrols of the waters around the islands , which are called the @entity173 in @entity52 and the @entity174 in @entity46			2
in november , @entity46 took a step towards achieving its ambition of becoming a leading naval power after successfully landing a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier for the first time			1
the carrier is @entity46 's first and was bought from the @entity182 but the country is planning to build its own			2
@entity46 spent ten years refurbishing the carrier , named @entity185 , after buying the unfinished former @entity187 navy ship in 1998			2
@entity9 's @entity188 has four ships which form the core of its amphibious fleet - helicopter carriers @entity193 and @entity194 , and assault ships @entity195 and @entity197 .			0

the @entity17 was launched at the @entity13 shipyard in southern @entity15 state on monday
@entity29 calls 37,000 tonne vessel its ' crowning glory ' after steadily building up its naval capabilities
on saturday , @entity1 activated an atomic reactor for its domestically built nuclear submarine
comes days after @entity52 launched its destroyer and months after @entity46 acquired aircraft carrier
@entity9 said last november that its £ 280m - a - year aid programme to @entity1 would be halted in 2015
