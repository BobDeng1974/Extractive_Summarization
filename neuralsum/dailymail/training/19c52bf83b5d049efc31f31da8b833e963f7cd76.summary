the sight of three suns in the sky is enough to make most of us rub our eyes in disbelief , but centuries ago , the strange sight was seen as a bad omen			1
the unusual spectacle , called a parhelion , was captured on camera in @entity11			1
it is the result of a natural phenomenon in which sunlight passes though snow crystals in a particular way when they are suspended in the air			1
sundogs are created when sunlight is refracted by large , hexagonal ice crystals , such as those in snowflakes			2
they typically appear as two coloured patches of light either side of the sun and though rare , can in theory be seen anywhere in the world in any season			1
photographs of the event show the sun in the centre , with two reflections either side , which can be described as sundogs or ‘ phantom suns ’			1
they are always at the same level of the sun on the horizon , as seen here they are created by the refraction of light passing through flat , hexagonal ice crystals in high , cold clouds			2
the crystals act like prisms so that as light passes through them , it is bent by exactly 22 degrees before reaching viewers ' eyes to make the illusion			1
if the crystals are more randomly located in clouds , a complete ring around the sun is visible , called a halo			2
but if the crystals sink through the air , they become arranged in vertical lines , so that the sunlight is refracted horizontally , to make sundogs , as seen in these images			0
if the phenomenon is seen as the sun is rising , the sundogs gradually move further away from the sun , but always stay at the same elevation , so the three ' orbs ' appear to be the same distance from the horizon			2
they are reddest in colour when they are near to the sun and fade to yellow , orange and then blue as they move away			0
the colours of sun dogs merge into a white halo in some instances			0
the strange phenomenon is first known to have been recorded by @entity103 between 384 and 322 bc. the @entity105 philosopher wrote : ' two mock suns rose with the sun and followed it all through the day until sunset '			1
he noted that they were always to the sun 's side and never rose above or below it			0
the poet @entity114 , who lived between 310 and 240 @entity115 mentioned them in his catalogue of @entity118 , saying that they indicate wind , rain or an approaching storm , while @entity123 , a diviner in the second century , included the phantom suns in his list of celestial deities			1
sundogs were sometimes seen as an omen for bad times ahead , such as war , and observations of them feature in ancient texts by @entity103 , @entity135 and @entity136 , among others			0
this depiction of sundogs appeared in the @entity140 , an early printed book shwoing world history , published in 1493 @entity144 authors @entity136 and @entity135 mention them in their writings too			0
in later works it was feared that sundogs were omens for bad times ahead , such as war			0
an anthelion is said to have occurred before the @entity153 in @entity154 in 1461 - a major event in the @entity156			0
apparently the @entity158 commander , later @entity157 of @entity159 , convinced his frightened troops - who feared the worst - that the event represented the three sons of the @entity163 and they won a decisive victory , as described in william shakespeare 's king @entity165			0
a powerful anthelion in the summer of 1629 is believed to have influenced @entity167 to write his work of natural philosophy called @entity170			0
sun dogs typically appear as two coloured patches of light either side of the sun and can be seen anywhere in the world in any season			2
this image shows a snowy landscape with the real sun on the left and a sundog on the right			1

the strange sight was captured on camera in snowy @entity11
video shows sundogs or ' phantom suns ' on either side of the real sun
phenomenon occurs when light passes through *airborne* snow crystals
