by @entity1 reporter published : 18:42 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 09:27 est , 5 september 2013 funny face : the photo that has sparked a controversy			0
it is believed @entity6 was trying to make schoolchildren laugh this unflattering picture of @entity6 sparked a censorship row yesterday			1
it shows the @entity12 president with a gormless - looking grin at a school to coincide with the start of the new term			1
the image was released by a photo agency			2
and when the agency tried to withdraw it from circulation , the photo quickly hit social media sites like @entity24 and went worldwide			2
the photo shows @entity6 grinning in front of a blackboard on which is written : ' today , it ’s back to school			2
' the photograph was taken on tuesday during mr @entity6 ’s visit to a school in @entity31 , northern @entity12 , to coincide with the start of term for hundreds of thousands of @entity12 pupils			1
it appears he was pulling a funny face to make the pupils laugh			0
the original image came with the caption : ' during a visit to the school @entity41 , september 3 , 2013 , @entity6 smiles , chairing a panel discussion on the reform of school timetables established by the government			2
' @entity46 initially posted the picture on its website as available for downloading but – apparently concerned it was inappropriate for a head of state – both later issued a ' mandatory kill ' notice , meaning the photo must not be used			1
@entity46 wrote : ' due to an editorial decision this photo has been withdrawn			1
please remove from all your systems			0
we are sorry for any inconvenience and thank you for your cooperation			0
' despite the ban , however , the image quickly hit social media sites like @entity24 , and sparked a flurry of comments			0
one wrote : ' here is the new official photo of @entity6			0
please put up in all town halls ! ' another wrote that no amount of @entity71 editing software ' can make the president look more intelligent '			0
photo kill : @entity46 released this image to withdraw the gurning picture of @entity6 ' due to an editorial issue ' a third , in a slightly subtler dig at plans to raise the state pension age , suggested mr @entity6 was thinking : ' how can i tell them they ’re going to have to retire at 80 ? ' once renowned as being one of @entity12 ’s funniest politicians with a knack for the bon mot , mr @entity6 has toned down his humour since becoming president , to accord more closely with the gravitas of his status as @entity12 head of state			1
quizzed by @entity12 media , @entity46 insisted it had come no pressure from the @entity95 to withdraw the photo , which continued to be available through @entity97 on a pooled basis			1
agencies withdrawing photos of public figures is very rare in @entity12 , hence the questions over why a state - funded agency like @entity46 would attempt to withdraw the image at a time when mr @entity6 wants to appear solemn over @entity106 and is commemorating the @entity108 war atrocity of @entity109			1
a bit more statesmanlike : president @entity6 with his @entity112 counterpart @entity111 yesterday			0

picture of @entity6 gurning was released by @entity12 agency @entity46
it was quickly withdrawn , sparking a censorship row
@entity46 is state - funded , but insists it was not asked to pull picture
