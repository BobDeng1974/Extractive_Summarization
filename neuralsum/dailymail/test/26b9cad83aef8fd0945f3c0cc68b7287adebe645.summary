characterised by their long beak and large throat poach used for catching prey and draining water , pelicans are already aesthetically peculiar looking birds			2
but it turns out that watching one yawn is an even stranger visual experience , as an @entity9 man discovered after coming face - to - face with one of the birds			0
capturing the footage in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity12 filmed the back of the large pelican sitting on a post overlooking the water			1

before it began lifting its head all the way back and opening its mouth extremely wide to show off the size difference between the two parts of its beak			2
