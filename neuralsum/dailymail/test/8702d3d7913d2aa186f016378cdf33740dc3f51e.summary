@entity0 says it has changed its policy when storing users ' funds as they will now be federally - insured for those who use @entity0 , their money just became safer with federal - level insurance			1
@entity8 confirmed to @entity9 in a statement that its current policy changed - meaning the company will store the balances for users of the mobile transfer service ( similar to @entity16 and @entity17 ) in multiple federally - insured banking institutions			1
this is good news for people who place large amounts of money in their @entity23 because the @entity24 insures funds for banking institutions up to $ 250,000			1
currently , @entity8 's user agreement says funds are not protected by the @entity24			1
however , a @entity8 spokesperson told @entity9 that the current policy has changed			1
the policy states that ' funds held by @entity33 or its service providers ( including any bank service providers ) in connection with the processing of @entity38 are not deposit obligations of @entity40 , and are not insured for the benefit of buyer by the @entity24 or any other governmental agency ' , according to 9to5			2
as a non-banking institution , @entity0 , along with @entity16 and @entity17 , is not legally required to be federally insured			1
but with the new change to its policy , funds in @entity23 are protected if anything were to happen to the company like bankruptcy			1
for example , for those who use mobile payment services where funds are not @entity24 insured , if a company files for bankruptcy , the user would become their creditor and would be required to go through bankruptcy court to get their money back			1
but for users with @entity24 insurance , they would receive their money from the government in a matter of days , according to @entity9			2
details on when @entity0 's user agreement will be updated were not provided			0
how @entity0 works : @entity0 , launched in 2011 , stores credit and debit card information , and lets shoppers pay for goods by tapping their phones against special terminals at store checkout counters			0
it works with any debit or credit card , on every mobile carrier			0
the service allows users to send money to anyone in the @entity84 with a @entity86 address , or request money on - the - go , directly from their bank account , debit card or @entity23			0
users can spend received money through the service in stores or withdraw cash from atms with the @entity96 , as well as transfer the funds directly to their bank account			0
it comes with 24/7 fraud monitoring , and users can disable their @entity0 app or card from their @entity0 account if they 're ever lost or stolen			0
source : @entity0 earlier this month , a federal judge rejected @entity8 's request to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the technology company of invading the privacy of users of its @entity0 electronic payment service by sharing their personal information with outside app developers			2
the judge said @entity8 must face claims it breached users ' contracts , violated the federal @entity119 which limits disclosure of electronic records , and violated a @entity123 consumer protection law			0
judge @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity123 said @entity0 users may try to show that @entity8 ' frustrated ' the purpose of its own privacy policy by allowing ' blanket , universal disclosure ' of their personal information to app developers whenever they bought apps in @entity8 's @entity135			2
the lead plaintiff is @entity137 , an @entity138 resident who said @entity8 sent unnecessary personal information about her to @entity140 when she paid that developer $ 1.77 for an email app. she said @entity8 raised the risk of identity theft by routinely sending information about @entity0 users such as addresses and zip codes , phone numbers and email addresses to app developers			2
@entity137 said the @entity153 , @entity123 - based company ceased the practice soon after the lawsuit was filed in september 2013			0
her lawsuit seeks class - action status , damages of $ 1,000 per violation , punitive damages and other remedies .			0

with the new change to its policy , funds in @entity23 are protected if anything were to happen to the company like bankruptcy
