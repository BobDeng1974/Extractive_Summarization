‘ they tended to be older but by definition people who have a lump sum to invest tend to be older			0
‘ what you did was put their savings at risk for your ends , when you had told them what you were going to do with their money			1
you told them they would get an immediate 12 per cent return when this was never achievable			0
‘ i find , from all of the evidence , that you knew it was never achievable and that the representation was simply not true			0
