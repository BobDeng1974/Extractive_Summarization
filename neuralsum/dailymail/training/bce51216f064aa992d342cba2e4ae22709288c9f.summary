the engineer whose commuter rail train was speeding when it derailed in the @entity3 , killing four people , went 24 mph over the speed limit on the same run a few days earlier , a federal agency indicated friday			1
charts released by the @entity8 showed the results of tests that used data recorders to look back at the speeds of trains run by @entity15 engineer @entity14 in the week before the accident			1
the chart shows that @entity14 broke the speed limit on four of the six runs tested			1
and at one point his train was going 54 mph in a 30 mph zone			1
more than 70 people were injured			1
the @entity8 would not comment friday on the findings			0
spokesman @entity34 said the charts speak for themselves			0
the agency has not yet determined a cause for the derailment , but reported earlier that @entity14 suffered from sleep apnea and said he felt ' dazed ' right before the crash			1
@entity14 's lawyer , @entity41 , said , ' there 's more information than these tidbits that have been released and i will comment at the appropriate time			1
' the speed charts were among dozens of documents involving several accidents that the @entity8 released friday			0
a report on the condition of the train after the derailment found that blood stained the seats , floors and doors			1
the cars were littered with dirt , rocks and even tree branches and lost almost all their windows on one side			0

' four people were killed when the commuter train went off the tracks			2
subsequent investigations showed it had been travelling at 84mph to a 30mph curve another document listed the crews ' cellphone calls and texts and appeared to confirm that the engineer and conductors were not using phones at the time of the crash			1

@entity102 said he was coming out of a tunnel when he noticed three workers too close to the track			0
he said two got out of the way , but one , later identified as @entity108 , 58 , leaned or fell into the train 's path			2
@entity102 also told investigators that track workers used to stop what they were doing when a train passed , acknowledge the engineer , and go back to work once the train has passed			0

' to me , ' he said			0
' that 's a little discomforting			0
' the other two workers on the tracks that night told investigators they were informed the track they were working on was out of service and were surprised when the train switched from another track			0
