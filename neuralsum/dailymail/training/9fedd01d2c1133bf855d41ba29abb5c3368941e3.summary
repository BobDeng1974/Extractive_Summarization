' it should be noted , however , that in no way does @entity14 engage in or support operations aimed at taking civilian lives , ' said the statement			0
' consequently , @entity14 has not contributed in connection to the military operation that led to the killing of @entity7 in @entity25			0
' @entity10 president @entity19 and defense secretary and former head of the @entity3 @entity91 were allegedly aware of @entity18 existence claims the @entity2 man the @entity3 did not offer a comment on the story to @entity96 , and the @entity97 did not issue a statement either			2

@entity138 , a former @entity3 officer and contributor to @entity140 , said that for the most part , @entity12 's account seems plausible			0
' this story is consistent with how you would infiltrate a terrorist group like @entity4 , ' @entity143 told @entity96			2
' you need someone who 's a plausible recruit ... he 's the perfect kind of infiltrator , perfect kind of plant inside of @entity4			2
' while all of @entity10 's technological lead was important to fight terror , @entity143 said that there was no substitute for a man on the ground			0
' the drones themselves are amazing technical phenomena , but the information that leads the drones to the target is what really matters , ' said @entity143			0
