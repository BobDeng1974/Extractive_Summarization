according to musical myth , the strings of violins were once made from cat guts			0
yet despite this , it seems that playing your pet a piece of classical violin music may be the best way to make them relax , according to new research			0
scientists have found that playing @entity14 's @entity15 can calm cats and may even help them recover quicker after a visit to the vets			1
the scientists played two - minute bursts of classical , pop and rock music to the animals and measured their reaction while under anaesthesia			1
most people will have heard music that sounds a bit like cats fighting - but it turns out that is not far from the kind music our feline pets actually enjoy			2
scientists have created what they say is the first species - specific music for domestic cats by replicating some of the sounds the animals produce themselves			1
they say the music could provide new ways for cat owners to enrich the environments that their pets live in while also helping to calm agitated animals			0
the cat music has been created by psychologists at the @entity68 and musicians at the @entity70			0
the music uses rhythms that mimics the pulsating of a cat 's purr along with melodies that were similar to their high pitched meows			2
in tests against classical human music by composers @entity83 and @entity84 , the cats showed stronger reactions to the feline tunes			2
just like in humans , however , the younger the cat was , the more excited it got about the music - with middle aged cats seeming the least interested			2
they found that the classical music - @entity14 's @entity15 - made the cats more relaxed while @entity96 's @entity95 was slightly less effective			1
listening to @entity98 's @entity97 appeared to increase the stress levels of the animals			1
while listening to music is known to reduce pain and stress in human patients , the study is thought to be the first to show it can also have the same impact in cats			1
dr @entity109 , a veterinary surgeon at the @entity110 , @entity38 who led the study , said : ' after reading about the influence of music on physiological parameters in humans , i decided to design a study protocol to investigate whether music could have any physiological effects on my surgical patients			1
' in the surgical theatres at the faculty where i teach and at the private veterinary medical centre where i spend my time operating , environmental music is always present			0
' during consultations i have noticed , for example , that most cats like classical music , particularly @entity131 compositions , and become more calm , confident and tolerant throughout the clinical evaluation			0
' the researchers played the music to 12 cats while they were undergoing neutering surgery through headphones			1
they attached a heartbeat monitor to the animals ' tongue , measured their respiratory rate and pupil diametre			0
the cats were exposed to two minutes of silence followed by random clips of music			0
the rock music of @entity98 , pictured above , seemed to increase the stress experienced by cats during surgery when listening to classical music , the cats had a lower respiratory rate and smaller pupil diametre , suggesting they were more relaxed			1
previous studies have suggested that cats prefer classical music because it contains tempos and frequencies that match purring for example			0
dr @entity109 and his colleagues suggest that playing classical music during surgery could help make surgery safer and improve an animal 's recovery			2
writing in the @entity168 , said : ' use of certain music genres in the surgical theatre may contribute to a decrease in the anaesthetic dose required , reducing undesirable side effects of anaesthetic agents and thus promoting patient safety			0
' the researchers now hope to look at how music might impact other animals including dogs			0
the strings of a violin were originally thought to have been made from cat 's gut , but playing classical violin music ( above ) , such as @entity15 , may also be the best way to calm your pet say the scientists			1

scientists at the @entity110 , @entity38 , fitted headphones to cats
they recorded the cats ' breathing and pupil size while undergoing surgery
the cats were calmer when listening to @entity14 's @entity15
when played @entity98 's @entity97 , their vital signs showed more stress while pop music like @entity96 's @entity95 gave *intermediate* results
