@entity1 's season continues to stumble from one disaster to the next , with the finger of blame pointed towards many sections within the club			1
the board , the manager , players , fans and even the pitch have come under fire this term but who is really to blame for the decline at @entity17 ? @entity18 looks at the key figures involved at the club and the part they have played in @entity21 ' rapidly dwindling fortunes			1
@entity23 and @entity24 ( right ) react during @entity1 's calamitous 2 - 1 @entity26 loss by @entity27 at @entity17 on sunday - their fourth home defeat of the campaign @entity30 @entity1 's owner may be a billionaire but he has n't exactly dipped deep into his pockets to help the club elevate from the also - rans into @entity26 title contenders			1
that may seem a crazy statement considering @entity21 have had summer transfer windows reaching over £ 100m in expenditure , and they have consistently over the last five years been one of the biggest spenders in the top flight			2
@entity30 hold @entity43 's arm as he watches on during @entity1 's 3 - 0 defeat by @entity45 at @entity17 earlier this season in the @entity26 but they have also raised plenty of funds through player sales , and as a result are bottom of the table of @entity26 net spenders over the last five years in comparison with every other top flight club			1
@entity30 was also on board with the decision to part company with @entity60 over two years ago			0
blame rating 3/5 @entity43 an increasing number of fans are losing patience with @entity43 , who has come under criticism for a range of issues including manager choices , stadium development and club 's managerial set - up			1
the @entity21 chairman has successfully overseen a project to build one of the most impressive training grounds in @entity76 at @entity77 , but his track record elsewhere is questionable			2
@entity43 has come under fire regarding the handling of a new stadium and his managerial appointments @entity83 ( 1998 - 2001 ) @entity84 ( 2001 - 2003 ) @entity85 ( 2003 - 2004 ) @entity86 ( 2004 ) @entity87 ( 2004 - 2007 ) @entity88 ( 2007 - 2008 ) @entity60 ( 2008 - 2012 ) @entity89 ( 2012 - 2013 ) @entity90 ( 2013 - 2014 ) @entity91 ( 2014 - present ) having gone through 10 managers since taking over in 2001 , no consistency is ever put down at the club and during that time @entity43 has favoured a continental approach of using a head coach and a director of football			2
it 's a system that 's never worked			0
@entity60 's tenure that took @entity21 to @entity101 football was a desperate breakaway from the format , with the current @entity105 boss having been originally brought in to clear up the mess left behind by @entity88 and @entity107 in 2008			2
a lack of discussion with fans over a controversial move to @entity113 's @entity112 ( which failed ) and constant delays over the build of the new stadium has made the club look amateurish in planning its future home - especially regarding the temporary move to @entity120			1
meanwhile long suffering fans are paying the second highest ticket prices in the league , with a partnership with ticketing site @entity125 also alienating sections of supporters			2
with the club in regression , many see @entity43 is a constant presence in every false dawn making him accountable to many fans over @entity1 's current plight			1
blame rating 5/5 @entity137 recruited as director of football in 2013 to ' assist ' @entity89 with transfers after @entity60 's managerial replacement had guided the club to their biggest ever @entity26 points haul the season before			2
his challenge was to reinvest the money collected from @entity146 's record £ 86million transfer to @entity148 and bring in a raft of replacements to make @entity21 an overall stronger squad			2
seven high profile signings and a little over a year later , all @entity21 have to show for the £ 100m - plus spend - up is a fairly positive season from @entity155 ( who has faded badly this term ) , and a rather decent rabona goal from @entity23 ( who has done little else as the club 's £ 30million record signing			1
) before joining @entity1 , @entity137 ( left ) was an assistant to @entity162 in the @entity164 set - up from left to right , @entity165 , @entity155 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity23 were the seven players signed to replace @entity146 - but none have consistently starred @entity166 at £ 26m has proven to be one of the @entity26 's worst ever striker signings , while @entity165 and @entity169 at over £ 25million combined are fortunate to even reach a matchday squad such is their poor contribution			1
@entity168 has made little impact while utility addition @entity167 is slowly starting to become the team 's key player			0
this year 's summer signings included @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 , with the latter two struggling to get on the pitch while the former can barely stay on it having already picked up two red cards			0
you had one job , @entity190 ... blame rating 4/5 @entity91 arrived in the @entity26 as an unknown manager on these shores at @entity194 at the start of 2013 and in18 months forged a reputation as one of the brightest bosses in the top flight			2
yet since taking over at @entity1 , that reputation is starting to take a hammering on a weekly basis			2
so what 's gone wrong ? the players appear to be struggling with @entity91 's pressing tactic and the @entity205 is either too stubborn to change it or lacking a @entity207 for his confidence - shot team			0
@entity91 looks on during @entity1 's @entity211 fourth round win over @entity212 earlier this season , the cup competitions have been the @entity21 boss 's highlights in a slow start at @entity17 the constant changing of starting line - ups suggest he still does n't know his best xi and if he did have a say in summer transfers , he appears to already have lost faith in all three of his signings who have hardly featured			1
with a team very similar to last season 's , @entity91 's side are already six points off @entity21 outfit			0
more worryingly will be the level of performances			0
@entity1 have already been rolled over with ease by @entity27 , @entity233 and @entity234 , while relative big guns @entity45 and @entity236 have already stuck seven goals past @entity21 this term			1
the @entity205 deserves more time to lay his blueprint on the squad however - especially with the team progressing well in @entity76 and the @entity211			0
blame rating 3/5 the players every team loses , it 's an inevitable of football			0
so when it does happen , fans can point blame towards tight refereeing calls , ways the team can learn from mistakes or just flat out settle that luck went against them			0
but on many occasions this season , @entity1 fans have been left with none of the above three to call upon			2
@entity1 have lost games showing very little ( if any ) danger in attack while throwing up a circus of a back four on many occasions			0
even the league wins are unconvincing , with the 4 - 0 home win over @entity105 the only time @entity21 have looked relatively comfortable playing in the top flight all season ( draws at @entity269 and @entity270 aside )			1
@entity24 and @entity167 share a discussion on the pitch during the 2 - 1 loss by @entity27 at @entity17 @entity274 infuriated fans after being unprepared to come on as a substitute against @entity27 on sunday after being forced to change his footwear considering the money spent on much of the first - team , it 's a rather poor return from the current squad			1
but with a team containing fingerprints from six previous @entity21 managers , it 's little wonder that the current crop have failed to settle into a cohesive unit			0
another pressing issue is the departure of long term stalwarts and characters in recent years such as @entity293 and @entity294 , leaving @entity21 with very few leaders on the pitch			0
blame rating 3/5 the fans @entity274 may have whipped up a frenzy in speaking about the negative atmosphere inside @entity17 provided by the home support , but he is n't the first to point the finger of blame at the @entity21 fans			1
@entity89 made a similar remark in the last few months of his reign of how he felt the fans were hindering rather than supporting his players with booing at matches			0
it 's a touchy subject , with supporters arguing that having paid for a ticket they have a right to voice their displeasure and that it 's up to the players to give them something to cheer about			0
@entity1 fans have been criticised by @entity274 and @entity89 before over their negative impact at @entity17 having often turned on their team with a chorus of boos when the home side are struggling it makes the opposition 's team - talk a lot easier though when you know a fast start at @entity17 will quickly lead to home fans getting on their side 's backs			1
@entity274 and @entity89 seem to make valid points though , with booing hardly a strong motivational tool to help get behind a struggling team			0
but to blame a section of supporters for a team 's plight is quite drastic			0
@entity1 's home fans need to show more patience and support for the benefit of their side but neither are they the cause of the problem			1
blame rating 1/5 previous managers a rot started under @entity60 when his team went on a disastrous run at the end of the 2011 - 12 campaign to throw away a @entity101 place , but the bounce back the following season under @entity89 makes @entity60 unaccountable for current events			0
blame rating 0/5 replacing @entity60 , was @entity89 and while @entity21 recorded their most ever points in a @entity26 season under @entity89 - many point towards @entity146 as the key reason behind their challenge for a @entity101 place in 2012/13			1
@entity60 , @entity89 and @entity90 have had managerail spells since 2012 at @entity1 after @entity146 's departure , @entity21 struggled to score and started suffering humiliating defeats by @entity236 ( 6 - 0 ) and @entity45 ( 5 - 0 ) leading to the @entity368 ' in december last year			1
the team 's now fragile mentality has n't recovered			0
blame rating 2/5 @entity90 was brought in to replace @entity89 shortly before @entity372 last year , but while @entity21 often beat teams below them in the table , they were often heavily defeated by the division 's best outfits			0
@entity90 promoted youngsters like @entity24 and @entity379 into the line - up but his honest attitude failed to install a team ethic in the squad and he was dismissed as manager in the summer			0
blame rating 1/5 @entity17 's ' small pitch ' not even the turf at @entity17 is avoiding the finger of blame , with @entity91 describing @entity1 's pitch as too small for the way his side like to play			1
@entity91 has described @entity17 's pitch as being too small for his team 's style of play it 's proving easy enough for the opposition to play on though while the same pitch has previously brought success for @entity60 's free - flowing @entity21			1

@entity1 have suffered their worst @entity26 start since 2008
@entity21 ' 2 - 1 defeat by @entity27 at @entity17 their fourth home league loss
@entity274 has criticised atmosphere created by home fans
