by @entity0 published : 10:43 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 11:09 est , 20 may 2013 sunbathers headed to the beach this summer will find new sunscreen labels on store shelves that are designed to make the products more effective and easier to use			1
but despite those long - awaited changes , many sunscreens continue to carry @entity9 ratings that some experts consider misleading and potentially dangerous , according to a consumer watchdog group			2
a survey of 1,400 sunscreen products by the @entity14 finds that most products meet new federal requirements put in place last december			1
warning : many sunscreens continue to carry @entity9 ratings that some experts consider misleading and potentially dangerous , a consumer watchdog group said today the rules from the @entity23 ban terms like ' waterproof , ' which regulators consider misleading , and require that sunscreens filter out both ultraviolet a and b rays			2
previously some products only blocked @entity31 rays , which cause most sunburn , while providing little protection against @entity35 rays that pose the greatest risk of skin cancer and wrinkles			1
despite that broader protection , one in seven products reviewed by the watchdog group boasted sun protection factor , or @entity9 , ratings above 50 , which have long been viewed with skepticism by experts			1
in part , that 's because @entity9 numbers like 100 or 150 can give users a false sense of security , leading them to stay in the sun long after the lotion has stopped protecting their skin			1
many consumers assume that @entity9 is twice as effective as @entity58 , but dermatologists say the difference between the two is actually negligible			2
where an @entity58 product might protect against 97per cent of sunburn - causing rays , an @entity9 product might block 98.5per cent of those rays			0
' the high @entity9 numbers are just a gimmick , ' says @entity68 , professor of epidemiology at the @entity70			0
' most people really do n't need more than an @entity72 and they should reapply it every couple of hours			0
' @entity75 says sunscreen should be used in combination with hats , clothing and shade , which provide better protection against ultraviolet radiation			1
some dermatologists say there may be some rationale for using higher @entity9 sunscreens , since users often do n't apply enough of the lotion to get its full effect			0
' @entity91 numbers are just a gimmick			0
most people do n't need more than @entity72 and should reapply every couple of hours ' ' the challenge is that beyond 50 the increase in uv protection is relatively small , ' says dr. @entity98 , chair of dermatology at the @entity100 in @entity101			1
the @entity9 number indicates the amount of sun exposure needed to cause sunburn on sunscreen - protected skin compared with unprotected skin			1
for example , a @entity9 rating of 30 means it would take the person 30 times longer to burn wearing sunscreen than with exposed skin			1
there is a popular misconception that the @entity9 figure relates to a certain number of hours spent in the sun. however this is incorrect , since the level of exposure varies by geography , time of day and skin complexion			0
the @entity23 itself said in 2011 that ' labeling a product with a specific @entity9 value higher than 50 would be misleading to the consumer			2
' at the time the agency proposed capping all @entity9 values at 50 because ' there is not sufficient data to show that products with @entity9 values higher than 50 provide greater protection for users			1
' but regulators have faced pushback from companies , including @entity137 , which argue that higher @entity9 products provide measurable benefits			2
as a result , the @entity23 says it is still reviewing studies and comments submitted by outside parties , and there is no deadline for the agency to finalize an @entity9 cap			0
it took the agency decades to put in place last year 's sunscreen changes			2
@entity23 first announced its intent to draft sunscreen rules in 1978 and published them in 1999			2
the agency then delayed finalizing the regulations for years until it could address concerns from both industry and consumers			0
the @entity23 is also reviewing the safety of effectiveness of spray - on products , which use different formulations from other sun - protection solutions			1
among other concerns , the agency is looking at whether the sprays can be harmful when inhaled			0
the survey by the @entity14 found that one in four sunscreens sold in the @entity171 is a spray product			1
' people like the sprays because they are quick to put on and cover a lot of area , ' said dr. @entity177 , a dermatologist in @entity178			0
' the downside is that you usually have to apply two coats			0
' more than 76,000 men and women in the @entity171 will be diagnosed with melanoma this year and 9,480 are expected to die from the aggressive form of skin cancer , according to the @entity187			0
the disease , which is often linked to ultraviolet exposure , is usually curable when detected early .			0

a survey of 1,400 sunscreen products by the @entity14 found that one in seven boasted sun protection factor above 50 .
