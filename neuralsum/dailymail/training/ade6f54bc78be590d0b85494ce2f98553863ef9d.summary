by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 published : 03:30 est , 1 august 2013 @entity4 : 12:14 est , 1 august 2013 he was already in a bit of a hole over fracking but , as he tried to make amends , @entity11 's father - in - law only managed to dig himself in even deeper			1
having by his own admission caused a ' great furore ' by declaring that shale gas exploration should take place in the ' desolate ' @entity17 , lord @entity12 corrected himself			1
he said he meant the @entity18 - sparking a fresh round of derision			1
controversy : lord @entity12 of @entity22 said fracking could go ahead in the @entity17 because it was inhabitable , but now insists he meant the @entity18 the @entity25 peer had told the @entity26 that ' beautiful rural areas ' of the @entity28 should be spared from the controversial drilling			1
instead there were ' large , uninhabited and desolate areas ' of the @entity17 where there was ' plenty of room for fracking '			1
his comments in the @entity26 drew gasps of astonishment – and immediate condemnation			0
archbishop of canterbury @entity41 tweeted : ‘ @entity17 very beautiful , rugged , welcoming , inspiring , historic , advancing , not “ desolate ” as was said in @entity26 today			1
’ but the former energy secretary now insists that what was on his mind when he made the incendiary remark was ' drilling going on off the @entity48 coast ' - in the @entity18			1
' it came out of my mouth as the @entity17 , which you can blame me for rightly , ' he told the @entity53			2
deputy prime minister @entity54 urged @entity12 to keep quiet			1
' i have a simple bit of advice for @entity12 , which is when you are in a hole , stop fracking , ' he said on his weekly @entity62 phone - in			1
@entity64 's shadow attorney general @entity63 lambasted the peer for implying it just wanted fracking to happen ' somewhere a long way from @entity67 '			0
journalist @entity68 tweeted a picture of @entity48 , adding : ' oi ! lord @entity12			1
it ’s not # desolate ! but it ’s all “ up there ” to some people eh ? ' @entity76 has drilled exploratory wells in @entity48 which is thought to be plentiful in natural gas - but the activity has been blamed for two small earthquakes in the area			2
lord @entity12 , father of the chancellor 's wife @entity82 , said he had made a ' stupid error ' by mentioning any location , because fracking needed to be ' far away from residences in unloved places that are not environmentally sensitive ' - unlike wind farms which he blamed for ' terrible desecration ' of the landscape			1
however he added : ' it 's odd that they 've decided to do this exploring in sensitive places down in @entity95			0
' @entity96 distanced itself from @entity12 on tuesday when the row erupted			2
@entity98 , the @entity25 energy minister , said there was ' exciting ' potential for shale gas in the ' north , south , east and west '			1
ministers said that the @entity28 could become ' the second biggest area of shale in @entity105 '			2
but mr @entity54 suggested that @entity106 include mr @entity11 and @entity107 were getting ' overexcited ' about its potential benefits			2
he warned it would be ' difficult ' to persuade local communities to accept fracking near their homes			0
mr @entity54 added : ' at the moment we are in a very early stage of all of this			2
my own hunch is that people are getting a little bit overexcited about how much gas is going to be yielded in a short period of time through fracking			0
' yesterday the daughter of singer @entity127 was arrested at anti-fracking protests			0
environmental activist @entity129 , 30 , had ' superglued ' herself to the entrance of a rural drilling site earmarked for potential fracking in @entity133			0
the site in @entity135 has become a focal point for communities concerned about the process			0
but yesterday energy minister @entity98 said that ' towns , villages and countryside ' could all be targeted for drilling if gas were discovered , no matter their location or beauty			0
determined : @entity129 superglued herself to @entity148 ' @entity147 ' @entity146 to create a ' human lock ' by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance removed : ms @entity127 and her partner mr @entity146 were arrested following the stunt at a protest against fracking planned for a site in @entity135 , @entity133 so far , 25 protesters have been held by police in @entity135			0
arrested alongside @entity159 - the daughter of the @entity161 ' @entity160 and the @entity163 star - was her boyfriend , eco-warrior @entity148 ' @entity165 , 55			0
they had glued their hands together in a ' human lock ' by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance at around 8.30am			0
a row of police officers acted as a human shield to hold back protesters while negotiating with the pair for more than two hours			0
they were eventually freed using glue thinner and were still in custody last night			0
they had set up camp opposite the main entrance to the gate			0
fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas for use as fuel			1
mr @entity98 warned the village would not be the only site in the @entity28 that could see drilling , if the country is to benefit from a gas bonanza			0
he added the @entity28 could become ' the second biggest area of shale in @entity105 ' and communities could benefit financially			2
in june , a @entity199 claimed there may be more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the @entity202 alone			1
industry experts claim even if 10 per cent is recovered - more than all of the gas produced from the @entity206 - it will be enough to power @entity105 for 50 years .			1

lord @entity12 branded ' *foolish* and ill - *informed* ' for attack on the @entity17
now claims he got it *wrong* , and meant to say the @entity18
deputy *pm* @entity54 says : ' when in a hole , stop fracking '
@entity105 has enough shale gas deposits to fuel the country for *40* years
archbishop of @entity219 *joined* row , calling @entity17 ' beautiful '
