a @entity1 woman who claimed she cured her cancer using a dietary program where she ate vast amounts of pineapple has pledged to release her medical records after critics questioned claims about her ' magic diet '			1
in the wake of recent controversy surrounding ' wellness warriors ' such as @entity13 founder @entity12 and the death of @entity16 advocate @entity15 , bloggers have demanded ' irrefutable proof ' that modelling agent @entity20 cured her cancer ' with juice '			1
ms @entity20 said she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2011			2
she initially had surgery to remove tumours from her neck that september and she then underwent a course of radiation treatment to ' mop up ' the cancer in december			2
but when a return visit to the doctors revealed cancer cells had spread to other parts of her body , ms @entity20 rejected further conventional medical treatment in favour of a diet and lifestyle plan she discovered online			1
she is planning to release relevant medical records without her personal details ' i was feeling a bit lost , just winging it on the internet myself , ' she said , until she discovered a @entity57 organisation called the @entity58			1
she would sometimes spend weeks on a fruit - only diet , taking up yoga and leaving her stressful job behind to join a positive - thinking dance group called @entity63			1
her diet program involved her drinking ' morning juice ' , dipping into boxes of pineapples each hour and taking vitamins			1
ms @entity20 said when she returned to the doctors months after embracing her new lifestyle , medical staff found her cancer had been radically reduced in size and is now gone			1
' i have got rid of it all ( the cancer ) 100 per cent myself through just hardcore nutrition , loving myself and meditating , adopting all stuff i thought never would have worked , ' she said			2
bloggers have questioned that assertion , demanding medical evidence for her claims and questioning her understanding of her radiation treatment			0
' i am merely requesting that you are transparent about something as serious as being able to cure cancer using nutritional means , ' one wrote			0
' the truth is not negative or mean or bullying in any way whatsoever			0
' in response , ms @entity20 said she was applying to obtain all her relevant medical records , which will take 45 to 60 days to obtain			1
she is planning release them in a @entity93 file , without personal details such as her @entity96 number and contact details			1
ms @entity20 also said she is seeking a trusted independent investigator to examine her claims and insisted she is not promoting her cause for fame or money			0
' i did n't even know about this @entity12 lady , ' she said			2
' i do n't know whether she did have cancer or what			0
' ms @entity20 ( pictured ) has been questioned by bloggers over claims she cured her cancer through a diet as well as meditation as part of the modelling world , ms @entity20 is friends with @entity115 ' i did n't even know about this @entity12 lady , ' she said			1
' i do n't know whether she did have cancer or what			0
' ' all i know is , she 's not me , i 'm not her			2
' my story is so far removed from anybody else 's story because it 's mine			0
' it 's unique , and it 's exactly how it happened			0
' so why am i not allowed to share that ? ' why am i not allowed to help people heal ? i 'm not making money out of this , i 'm not trying to hurt anyone			0
' ' i 'm not a fraud and i 'm not a fake '			1
ms @entity20 said she ' totally understood ' that people were sceptical and that people were concerned her message could discourage people from seeking conventional treatments - but that was n't her agenda			0
' it just seems they 've got this massive agenda to break down my story			0
' i know i can sleep at night and in my heart i am doing what i know to be right			0
' ' i have n't changed anything , i have n't deleted anything			0
' it really did change the way i f * * * ing lived '			0
@entity149 nutritionist @entity148 said maintaining a healthy diet is ' one of the things you can do to support your treatment ' , but dismissed ' magic diets ' as unproven			0
' i think it 's really important for anybody who is facing cancer that they put their faith in medical doctors who are going to be backed up by sound research , ' ms @entity148 said			1
' a lot of the people claiming these cures with special magic diets you need to ask - where 's the scientific studies there to back them up , and they are missing in this case			2
' oncologist dr @entity171 , the director of the @entity172 , said there was evidence a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables with less red meat could prevent cancer			1
but dr @entity171 , from the @entity181 , said there was little evidence to suggest food could cure cancer and that he was concerned about the popularity of so - called ' wellness warriors '			2
' people may be lured into abandoning or not taking up potentially curative treatments because something 's become popular for which there is no evidence			0
' even if someone claimed they were cured by a certain diet , you 'd like to know if that happened one in two ( cases ) or one in 20000 - but these anecdotes get blown up into suggestions for lifestyle			1
' @entity20 ( pictured left ) would sometimes spend weeks on a fruit - only diet , taking up yoga and leaving her stressful job behind to join a positive - thinking dance group called @entity63 .			1

@entity1 woman claimed she cured cancer through her pineapple - centric diet
it involved eating vast amounts of fruit and *ditching* ' toxic ' influences
critics have demanded ' irrefutable proof ' that is how she cured her cancer
she is planning to release her medical records when she *collects* them all
' i 'm not @entity12 and she 's not me , ' she told @entity228
' i 'm not a fraud and i 'm not a fake '
