by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 10:24 est , 21 may 2013 hundreds of autism sufferers are being recruited by a @entity3 software designer to train as high tech it experts			2
@entity5 said it wants to recruit up to 500 sufferers because ' they think differently from others '			1
an autistic person is more likely to be of average or above - average intelligence and possess ' certain skills ' that the company wants to tap into			1
the firm employs more than 65,000 people globally			1
by 2020 the aim is for one percent of these to be autistic , it announced from its headquarters in south - western @entity3			1
@entity17 in @entity18 , a film that first brought autism into the public eye recruitment begins this year in @entity3 , @entity23 and @entity24 , assisted by @entity26 specialists with experience in hiring autistic people for large firms			2
indeed there is a higher than normal proportion of autistic people working in the information technology industry			2
autism as a condition was first brought home to millions by @entity37 in the movie @entity18 in which he played the autistic brother of @entity41 's character			1
some people have no language , intellectual difficulties and are not able engage with others			2
other people may have very good or even advanced language skills but find social behavioural norms hard to grasp			2
the @entity3 firm wants more one per cent of its 65,000 - strong workforce to be autistic by 2020 autism has a strong genetic basis , although the genetics of autism are complex			1
parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child 's life			0
they usually develop gradually , but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress			0
early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help autistic children gain self - care , social , and communication skills			1
although there is no known cure , there have been reported cases of children who recovered			0
autism and asperger syndrome are both part of a range of related developmental disorders known as autistic spectrum disorders ( @entity77 )			0
@entity77 can cause a wide range of symptoms including difficulties with social interaction , impaired language and communication skills as well as unusual or repetitive patterns of thought and physical behaviour			0
some people with autism are low - functioning meaning that they find it difficult to speak , interact and in some cases are only able to process minimal amounts of information			1
however , at the other end of the spectrum is a very high - functioning sufferer , who can in many cases outperform people with no underlying condition			1
studies have shown that these autistic people possess an enhanced ability to process information and remember data			0
this may explain why there is a higher than normal proportion of autistic people working in the information technology industry			0
a @entity111 study carried out last year gave 16 adults with autism and 16 adults without autism a task designed to assess their ' perceptual load capacity '			0
both groups were successful at the task in the easier initial stages , but the adults with autism significantly outperformed those without autism as the task became more difficult			0
this , the scientists said , proved that the brains of autistic people are able to process greater amounts of information			0
previous studies have also linked the trademarks of genius - breathtaking achievement , attention to detail and obsession with a particular subject - to autism .			1

by 2020 , @entity5 wants one per cent of its 65,000 - strong workforce to have the condition
