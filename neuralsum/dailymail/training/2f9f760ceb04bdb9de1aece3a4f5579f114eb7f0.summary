these pictures make for an eerie throwback to a bygone era ; all dusty red bricks , broken fibro walls , torn lino and worn wallpaper			0
it 's akin to popping the top off an 1980s time capsule			0
they are the properties bought up in a frenzy almost 30 years ago , when federal government thoughts first turned to a second international airport for @entity14 , in the far south - western rural suburb of @entity16			1
now these once proud family homes stand idle , unloved and weather - beaten , in what resembles an urban ghost town , only playing host to itinerant rental residents , occasional squatters , brown snakes and marijuana growers			1
this one was gutted by fire just a few months back with the family renting the home ' lucky to escape ' an abandoned swing - set adds to the post-apocalyptic scene in @entity16 , one of the few signs that this property was once home to a family but its future , like many others in the rural suburb , is bleak with bulldozers to move in within months @entity16 has been earmarked as the site of @entity48 's next major international airport			1
work is set to begin in 2016 after the issue was first flagged more than 50 years ago market gardeners in the @entity16 area have all but given up hope			1
here an empty wheelbarrow , dead plants and cucumbers are lying on the floor - an eerie abandoned greenhouse where the owners have been told they will need to vacate in a few months marijuana plants are dotted amongst the overgrown yards - while a rusty old sign gives glimpses of a forgotten community tins of food , coffee mugs and various foodstuffs are strewn across benches in now - empty kitchens the need was first flagged in the 60s @entity16 , @entity71 , @entity72 and even @entity73 have been mentioned as options @entity16 was nominated by the @entity75 over @entity71 in 1986 the buy - up of homes across almost 2000 hectares would cost the government more than $ 170 million a halt was put on the plan in the year 2000 by the then @entity81 @entity82 this year announced it was on again and work is to begin in 2016 the cost is expected to top $ 2.5 billion old toys , books and clothes litter the floors and the only sign of life is when a stray cow wanders up , hopeful for a feed			1
dozens of properties were snapped up back then , perched across almost 2000 hectares of prime real estate ; now those same places can boast only overgrown backyards , pseudo garbage tips , smashed doors and other relics from the past			1
there are the unpaid utility bills for the ' unknown owner ' still stuffed in letter boxes and mature marijuana plants standing proudly amid the rubble			1
other , more traditional plants from market gardeners ' toils have been left to wither on the vine			2
the local primary school has just eight pupils and despite more than 100 years of history at @entity116 , it will close it doors at year 's end			0
work on the airport is expected to begin in 2016 after the commitment to build was made by @entity82 earlier this year			2
the cost is estimated to be upwards of $ 2.5 billion and the first flights could be operating within 10 years - some other sticking points have emerged			2
they include the pledge that there will be no curfews placed on airlines , which means around - the - clock operation of the new airport ( unlike @entity134 ) and then the predicament of just who among @entity48 's most famous will be honoured with the name			1
left behind : remnants of fences , lengths of wire , a television and a stroller make up a collection of random relics in the town piles of old clothes , garbage and an @entity48 flag lie in a squalid kitchen shielded from the outside world by drawn blinds			2
squatters have been making home inside some of the abandoned premises and locals say ' it 's hard to know who 's going in or out ' dozens of abandoned properties are strewn across the once thriving rural suburb of @entity16 , which appears closer than ever than being @entity48 's next major airport site with work scheduled to begin in 2016 do n't get too close : patches of the community have been earmarked as ' @entity169 '			1
some residents have benefited through cheap rent but have been told to pack their bags welcome to @entity16 : the urban ghost town only to plays host to itinerant rental residents , squatters and marijuana growers			1
even the local primary school , with more than a century of history , is to close its doors a road to nowhere : it 's hard to picture today but @entity16 is destined for much greater activity with the building of an international airport in these paddocks ... for now , parts of it , resembles a ghost town @entity190 say some of the abandoned houses should be knocked down to ' stop people going in and out ' some places are inhabited , a few abandoned – but all share the same fate , at the mercy of a bulldozer 's might , to be consigned to history those who 've had the benefit of lower rent costs have been told to vacate by june next year locals tell the tale of one family 's ' lucky escape ' when their rental went up in flames a few months ago			1
this abode is now more ramshackle than renovator 's delight			0
' they should have knocked it down ages ago , ' said neighbour @entity215			0
' it 's too hard to stop people going in and out of it even now			0
' some places are inhabited , a few abandoned – but all share the same fate , at the mercy of a bulldozer 's might , to be consigned to history			2
those who 've had the benefit of lower rent costs for the past decade have been told to vacate by june next year			0
panels of wood and sheets of metal , reduced to nothing more than scraps , strewn among overgrown fields @entity238 councillor and @entity240 president @entity239 says it 's inevitable that an airport will go ahead in the eerily sparse suburb , many backyards now home to overgrown weeds and the odd animal letters to no - one : many mailboxes are stuffed with piles of unread correspondence and unopened bills the only sign of life is when a stray cow wanders up , hopeful for a feed a @entity258 poster and a broken front door ... evidence there has been an occupant but little else @entity239 , president of the @entity240 ( @entity240 ) , said the old neighbourhood has to make way			2
' for the first time in a long time we 've seen that this ( new airport ) is going to happen , ' he said			0
' all signs are that it is full steam ahead and residents have been given their notices			0
' it will be a shame to do all this work and kick the residents out if we do n't eventually see an airport here			0
' overgrown yards are a common site - complete with marijuana plant near the back door and with a decrepit boxing bag pictured hanging from a tree in the background ' a lot of families will be affected by this but in fairness 30 years ago they knew that this was going to probably be a site for an airport so i suppose it 's been that political football as to if and when it was going to happen , now it is , ' mr @entity239 added			1
the @entity238 councillor admitted a rundown neighbourhood was always on the cards			0
' it is government owned land and obviously it does get neglected that little bit more than if it was owned by an individual who would come in and fix them up , ' mr @entity239 said			0
' it 's ripe for people to come in and who knows what is happening in these backyards			0
' rubbish and remnants of life lie strewn across paddocks toys and books lie on the floor - as if the residents of this house were forced to leave in a hurry without notice nothing but a rusty oil drum and a wire fence guard this property			2

dozens of properties were bought by the @entity326 back in the 80s in *preparation* for a second international airport in @entity14
abandoned homes dot the *landscape* in @entity16 , relics from decades past
marijuana plants stand proudly at the back doorstep of one burnt - out house
locals say the pseudo garbage tips among almost 2000 hectares do *n’t* *concern* them as much as the brown snakes
