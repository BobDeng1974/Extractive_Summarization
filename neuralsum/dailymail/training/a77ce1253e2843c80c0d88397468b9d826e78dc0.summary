as maces crash into shields and battle axes cut into armor , knights are left wounded and bloodied on the battlefield			1
but while this scene appears reminiscent of a @entity9 clash , these fights are happening in the @entity10 with the launch of a new extreme sport in the form of a medieval fight club			1
the @entity15 of @entity10 ( @entity15 ) sees knights from different states face each other in battle , armed with maces and swords			1
founding member @entity37 said : ' it is as rough as human beings can be with one another without one of them dying			2
' the acl currently has around 100 people doing battle across @entity10 and was launched to give people enthusiastic about the medieval era the chance to relive it			1
mr @entity37 added : ' it just feels completely natural to us			0
this is what our ancestors did in the 14th and 15th centuries			0
' it 's a medieval fight club but we do want people to talk about it			1
' i ca n't think of any other sport that is more intense			0
we are using real weapons , full force , full speed			1
' i 'm hitting a guy with a battleaxe in the back and other guys are getting hit in the head with a mace			0
' knights from rival factions based in different states meet each other in often fierce armed combat those taking part are often left battered and bruised after facing each other , often with their wives looking on organisers said the club allows them to be as rough as possible for human beings without killing eachother there are around 100 knights in @entity10 but the group hopes that will expand so more people can take part mr @entity37 who is a full time knight and combat trainer said another reason for launching the club was the code of honor that fighters of the medieval era followed			1
he added : ' i try to live by the values of a knight			2
i try to adhere to the virtues of chivalry and justice and honour and truth			0
' in this day and age a lot of people do n't believe in an awful lot			0
' the knights who lived in a very violent time had a code that they had to adhere to - if people held themselves to stronger codes today we 'd all get along a lot better in this world			2
' battles are held with rival factions - with the @entity113 recently taking on the @entity114			0
the club has brought a medieval fight club to @entity117 , with knights taking the subway as they go to training despite the cost of armor and weapons for the battles , there are already more than 100 members of the club the @entity114 of @entity117 decided to practice their battle skills in @entity128 in preparation for combat in preparation for the tournament - two of the @entity114 of @entity117 , @entity133 , 47 , and @entity134 , 35 , took to the streets to practice			1
mr @entity134 , a medieval history student , said : ' i do n't think two medieval knights training for battle is the strangest thing people would see in public in @entity117			2
' enthusiasm for the sport is growing in @entity10 - despite the high costs of taking part			2
a standard suit of armor can cost around $ 1,500 but top of the range protection can cost upwards of $ 15,400			2
organisers said people taking part are from a variety of different backgrounds , often looking for a chance to be a hero than some sort			0
and the sport also appears to take its toll on the wives of the knights , who are forced to watch their loved ones competitors from @entity114 ( left ) recently faced the @entity113 ( right ) in @entity164 competitors talk tactics and ensure all their armor is in place as they prepare for battle in @entity164 @entity170 , 35 , has watched her husband @entity171 do battle as one of the @entity114 of @entity174			1
' he is actually in retail but works for a company that sells building materials , ' she said			0
' when he is out of his armour he 's just like a normal , funny guy , ' in his armor he is pretty much fierce and beastly			0
it 's quite amazing to behold and it is very sexy , very , very much so			0
' however she does admit the weaponry causes some concerns			0
' the extremeness of the fighting is on my mind and i know that they are real weapons and that these guys are really into it , ' she added			1
the group currently has around 100 members but hopes to expand across the @entity10 .			1

@entity15 of @entity10 has *created* a @entity9 fight club
knights from different parts of @entity10 *don* armor to do battle with each other
each ' knight ' uses real weapons and full force in clashes with their rivals
they are armed with battle axes , swords and maces for each battle
around 100 members so far and group hopes it will grow across @entity10
founder @entity219 said it is ' as rough as humans can be ' without dying
