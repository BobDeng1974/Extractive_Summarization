a season - defining injury is not unheard of for @entity2 fans			1
but a Â£ 42.5million signing , out for three months with @entity3 also missing ? alarm bells are ringing			0
@entity6 will miss the remainder of 2014 with a knee injury , the @entity5 confirmed			1
a dazzling player at his best , the top no 10 in the world on his day ; but is his injury all bad for @entity13 ? here , @entity14 looks at three reasons why @entity2 will suffer without @entity6 , and three why everything could be all right ... @entity6 has been ruled out for the remainder of 2014 with a knee ligament injury @entity6 on the ground against @entity19 - but could @entity2 's season take off without their record signing ? against the win percentage @entity2 are no doubt a better team with @entity6 in the starting @entity23 and on form , but the stats suggest @entity13 copes without his record signing			1
the @entity27 score more goals on average with the playmaker around , but have a win percentage of just 56.2 per cent when he 's involved compared to 61.5 per cent without him			1
statistics are n't the be-all and end - all , but are perhaps a reminder to fans that it 's not the end of the world			0
@entity41 fans have seen glimpses of what @entity41 can do during his three years at the club , but too often those moments have been split up by niggling injuries			0
this year ( so far ) seems to tell a different story for the 21 - year - old , who has impressed on the wing in recent weeks			0
a mixture of raw pace and with the confidence to surge past defenders , whether it be out wide or through the middle , an extended run in the team could follow for the @entity57			0
and that wo n't harm @entity59 , either ... are @entity2 really better off without @entity6 ? their record when he is not on the pitch suggests so @entity41 could be granted an extended run in the team in @entity6 's absence big games against @entity69 , @entity19 and @entity70 this season , there has been a common theme for @entity2 ; 4 - 5 - 1 , @entity6 on the wing			1
funnily enough , the natural playmaker has produced his worst performances out wide			0
it 's tough to criticise @entity6 when playing in his best position but he 's almost non-existent when tasked with tracking back and creating from the right or left			2
@entity13 inexplicably failed to substitute the @entity79 man against @entity19 at the weekend despite his struggles , and players who are more suited for the wide areas should start the next crunch clashes			2
@entity84 , @entity70 and @entity85 await in the next three months			0
@entity6 ( left ) struggled on the wing in big games against @entity69 , @entity19 and @entity70 for pass master consistency is key for @entity6 , who was @entity91 's ' top passer ' for the 2013 - 14 season , his first in @entity59 football			2
eclipsing @entity94 and @entity95 , the 25 - year - old 's pass accuracy in the final third was a staggering 84.24 per cent , and put simply @entity2 do n't look the same without him			2
the @entity27 struggled for fluidity when @entity6 picked up an injury against @entity101 , with many players lacking the nous the @entity104 possesses in and around the penalty area			2
the @entity79 playmaker was the top passer in the @entity108 last season @entity2 's speedsters much has been made of @entity110 and @entity111 so far this season , while the soon - to - return @entity113 has hardly been mentioned			1
these three could form the quickest partnership in the @entity108			0
and who better to assist them than @entity6 , who was praised for helping @entity118 flourish at @entity119 ? @entity111 and @entity6 already showed glimpses that they were beginning to click , while @entity110 was also profiting			1
@entity110 and @entity111 certainly would have benefited with @entity6 in the team finishing off lesser teams as much as @entity6 goes missing in the bigger games out on the wing , his impact against the so - called lesser teams in the @entity108 ca n't be questioned			1
he keeps things ticking , not allowing opponents to lose their concentration			0
one slip , and he 'll pick you off with a through ball			0
@entity41 and @entity113 have the pace to hurt defences , but they certainly do n't have the guile of @entity6			1
@entity6 is brilliant against so - called lesser teams , often opening them up with a pass and scoring the odd goal @entity141 out for up to 12 weeks with knee injury			1

@entity6 ruled out for the remainder of 2014 with knee ligament injury
how will @entity2 cope without their record signing ?
@entity13 's side 's win percentage is better when he 's not involved
but who will assist @entity111 , @entity110 and @entity113 ?
