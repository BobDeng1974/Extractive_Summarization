by @entity0 for the residents of a sleepy upstate @entity5 , the @entity3 film it 's a @entity6 has a special place in their hearts			1
those living in @entity10 believe their homely town , with its steel truss bridge and broad main street , is where @entity14 based his classic film			1
and , while a direct connection between the director and the town ca n't be confirmed , it does n't stop its 9,000 residents celebrating the movie every @entity3			1
@entity10 in @entity40 claims to have been the inspiration for @entity14 's 1946 film			1
the town has similar features to the fictional @entity37 , including a steel truss bridge , broad @entity46 , and railroad station			2
characters in the film also refer to nearby towns such as @entity51 and @entity52			2
local barber @entity53 is believed to have cut @entity14 's hair when the director passed through the town in 1945			1
in 1917 , @entity10 resident @entity57 saved a woman 's life after she jumped from the town 's bridge - an act seemingly reflected in the 1946 film			1
a plaque commemorates @entity57 , who died after getting the woman to safety			0
each year bells are run in the town to remember him as ' an angel who got his wings '			2
@entity10 holds a weekend celebration based around the classic film every december			2
every year , members of the community dress as characters including @entity78 and mean mr @entity79 , for a parade down the @entity46			2
they even mark the end of the festival with a ringing of the bells in memory of @entity57 , who saved a woman 's life in 1917 , and to honor ' angels ' nominated by current residents			1
' @entity14 always said @entity37 represented little slices of small towns that he had visited all across @entity91			1
we 're not in a position to dispute that , ' @entity96 , a trustee for the town 's it 's a @entity95 , said			2
' we just think we 're a bigger slice			0
' while there 's no definitive proof that @entity14 ever set foot in @entity10 , local barber @entity53 claimed he cut the director 's hair in 1945 , as he passed through on his way to visit an aunt			1
mr @entity53 , who died in 2011 , did n't initially know the customer he chatted with was famous , but the surname @entity14 stuck in his head because it means ' goat ' in @entity110			2
the 1946 film starred @entity33 as @entity32 , a small - town , frustrated banker who realizes his life 's value after @entity115 shows him what would become of @entity37 if he had never been born			0
the homey town falls into the clutches of the greedy slumlord @entity79 , and his @entity37 becomes a city of sin , with sleazy nightclubs , burlesque halls , pawn shops and neon lights			0
@entity3 spirit : @entity127 dresses as character @entity79 for the annual parade parade : actors dress in costumes inspired by the film for an annual celebration in @entity10 connection : the steel truss bridge in @entity10 , above , is similar to the one in the film , below hero : in an act similar to the film 's plot , @entity10 resident @entity57 saved a woman 's life after she jumped from the town 's bridge			1
in the film , @entity30 jumps in so @entity32 will rescue him if @entity37 - the nice one , not the naughty one - really was modeled after @entity10 , @entity14 never let on before his death in 1991			1
but there are striking similarities			0
@entity10 has a broad main street like @entity37 , and its bridge has a plaque dedicated to a man who lost his life by diving in after a suicidal woman in 1917 - an act echoed in the film			1
@entity159 , who played @entity32 's daughter @entity160 in the movie and is a festival regular , said the similarities were so striking that she blurted out ' it 's @entity37 ! ' during her first visit			0
the film also has references to nearby upstate cities			0

@entity32 's wealthy friend @entity170 talks of building a factory outside @entity51 , and his brother is offered a job in @entity174			0
@entity37 also has a @entity175			0
the word " genesee " is from the @entity177 and is closely associated with the @entity178 that includes @entity10			2
popular : nearly 3,000 people , pictured coming across the bridge , took part in a fun run as part of the town 's festivities on saturday classic : @entity32 with his family in it 's a @entity6 stamp of approval : a festive postmark highlights the town 's claims to have been the inspiration for fictional @entity37 seasonal attraction : the weekend festival celebrating the film brings in visitors including @entity199 , center , the daughter of actress @entity201 , who played @entity202 festive : the holiday classic , starring @entity33 , left , and @entity201 , center , was made in 1946 perhaps fitting for a @entity3 story , the contention that @entity10 is the real @entity37 comes down to belief			1
' there just is no evidence to support it , but @entity216 bless them , ' @entity209 , curator of the @entity210 at @entity211 and author of @entity213 , said			0
ms @entity209 said @entity14 was a meticulous record keeper , yet she has never come across the link in his records , diary entries or script notes - not to mention the many conversations she had with @entity14 over years			1
' i hate being in the role of mr @entity79			0
i 'm sorry , everybody			0
i wish i could say : " @entity226 ! and here it is ! " but the fact is there is absolutely no evidence to confirm this , ' she said			0
it 's also possible that @entity14 might have known of @entity234 , a hamlet in the moneyed community of @entity37 ( think @entity170 ) north of @entity237			1
happy holidays : visitors @entity240 and @entity241 explore @entity10 with their festive - looking dogs gifts : florist @entity244 hands out nearly 1,000 free roses to visitors who come to @entity10 for the parade but @entity249 , executive director of the @entity250 , said that the place is not similar to @entity37 and that a case has never been seriously made			1
it 's also possible @entity37 was meant to be an ideal , not a place			0
ms @entity209 noted that the great thing about it 's a @entity6 is that everyone feels it 's their hometown			0
and that 's just fine to some @entity10 partisans			1
' we 're ok not having proof			0
in fact , maybe having a little mystery behind it makes it even better , ' mr @entity96 said			0
' keeps the magic going			0
