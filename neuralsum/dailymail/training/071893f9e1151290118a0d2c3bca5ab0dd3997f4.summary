by @entity0 published : 12:52 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 16:21 est , 25 june 2012 sitting in the public gallery at @entity3 , civil servant @entity1 grasped her sister 's hand and collapsed in tears as her father @entity7 was jailed for killing her mother			1
yet , the 28 - year - old , who works at the @entity10 , was not just grieving for her 44 - year - old mother @entity11 , who had been strangled to death with her own dressing gown cord			1
she was mourning the fact that her father , who also worked at the @entity10 , would spend the next 11 years behind bars			1
in a remarkable act of forgiveness , @entity1 and her younger sister @entity19 , 25 , even sent a letter to the court begging for their dad 's freedom			1
they described their parents as ' a couple who could n't be apart but should n't have been together '			2
' they had an intense and destructive relationship that brought out the worst in each other , ' they added			2
heartbreaking : @entity31 was jailed for strangling his wife @entity11 to death			1
his daughters @entity1 and @entity19 , are still close to their dad			1
@entity1 , centre , is pictured with @entity19 , left , and their father , right , when they were younger now , speaking for the first time since that day four years ago , @entity1 said : ' a lot of people will struggle to understand how we could forgive dad			1
' but i 've never blamed him for mum 's death because it was not his fault			1
he 's like two different people to me			2
the person who killed my @entity51 was n't my dad			2
he was someone different , who was n't in control of what he was doing			2
' my dad is a really gentle man and it must have taken a lot to push him to do something so awful			2
he lost his rag and saw red			2
that 's how i deal with it in my head			2
i separate the person who killed mum from the person who is my dad			2
' @entity1 's story is told in the @entity68 documentary lifers , which is screened on @entity69 tonight			1
filmmakers were granted unprecedented access to @entity73 's @entity72 , home to 600 men sentenced to life in jail			1
@entity31 , now 51 , who worked for the @entity10 in @entity3 , has been at the prison since he was sentenced to life on november 12 , 2008			1
he had strangled his wife at their home in @entity82 , near @entity3 after she had taunted him about her new lover			1
@entity1 , who is now doing a degree in art history , told the programme : ' i feel i had all the advantages life had to offer me			1
that makes me feel my crime is in some way worse than everybody else 's			2
when you kill the person you love , it 's almost like a double grief			2
you grieve for the loss and you grieve for the fact you 've caused that loss			2
' tragic : @entity7 and @entity11 on their wedding day			1
@entity7 strangled his wife at their home in @entity82 , near @entity3 after she had taunted him about her new lover it had all seemed so different when they got married at the @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 , in the summer of 1983			1
@entity1 was born on @entity109 the following year and @entity19 came along two years later			1
but in 1996 - when @entity1 was 12 and @entity19 ten - the couple , who both worked for the @entity10 , were forced to relocate to @entity3			1
' we were definitely aware they had problems , ' recalled @entity1			1
' they had lots of fights over money and the stress it was causing			2
i think moving to @entity3 made things worse because @entity51 was away from her family and lost her support network and missed her parents			2
' but i have lots of good memories from childhood – going out for day trips to @entity128 and on family holidays			2
when they were n't fighting there was a lot of love between them and things were really good			2
' the couple 's relationship teetered on until their daughters had left school but in 2005 they separated for a year			0
@entity1 moved out to live in a flat in @entity141 while his wife stayed in the family home with @entity1			1
@entity19 was in her first year at @entity143			0
' @entity51 and @entity144 were n't talking at the time , ' said @entity1			1
' i remember her finding a receipt for some furniture he was buying			0
he had rented a flat and had the delivery details on it with his new address			0
@entity51 read it and said : “ oh			0
he must be moving out			0
” difficult : @entity1 and @entity19 visiting a zoo with their mother @entity11			1
the sisters said their parents had ' an intense and destructive relationship that brought out the worst in each other ' ' i was quite relieved at the time because i wanted them both to be happy – and if they were n't happy together i 'd rather they were happy apart			0
the tension was so high – they would fight , not talk for a couple of months and then get back together and then the cycle would start again			0
' but at the same time it 's so hard when your parents split up			0
you feel awful and you are torn in two directions			0
you do n't want to take sides			0
@entity144 was in a serious bout of depression and would n't talk to anyone while @entity51 saw it as a new start			0
' however , about a year later , @entity1 returned home			1
' he wrote to @entity51 saying he was ill and would like to meet up and talk about it , ' said @entity1			1
' she went for a drink with him and he came back with her and sat down in the front room			0
it was all a bit confusing			0
they did n't explain anything to us			0
they just went on as if nothing had changed			0
sadly they did n't have marriage counselling			0
' close : @entity1 and @entity19 with their father on bonfire night			1
the two sisters sent a letter to @entity3 begging for their dad 's freedom before he was sentenced for killing their mother within a year @entity1 had moved out , exhausted by her parents on - off relationship			1
she barely spoke to her mother again			2
' it became unbearable living there , ' explained @entity1			1
' that 's why i moved out			0
we never had any big blow - ups but she would give me the cold shoulder and silent treatment and act like i was n't there			2
' @entity1 did not talk to her mother again until her father had a heart attack in march 2008			1
even then her mum got a friend to call her			0
by then her parents were separated - although they lived in the same house , ate together , travelled to work together and went on trips together			2
@entity1 still did the washing , his wife 's ironing and paid the major bills			1
when he was in hospital , his wife visited him every day			0
' i went out of my way to drive her to the hospital , ' recalled @entity1			1
' but she treated me like a taxi driver			0
she was very short and abrupt and could n't bear to say thank you to me			0
' happy : @entity1 , @entity19 and their father are pictured on holiday in @entity237			1
@entity7 was sentenced to 11 years behind bars for killing their mother but towards the end of the year , @entity11 began dating someone else and @entity1 emailed both his daughters asking to stay the night			1
' it was the first time i had seen him since his heart attack , ' said @entity1			1
' he was very down			0
there was definitely something wrong			0
but he did n't specify what it was and i did n't push him			0
perhaps i should have ? hindsight is a brilliant thing			0
' @entity1 spent @entity254 with her sister and the pair had lunch with @entity1 's now ex-boyfriend @entity258 , a warehouse worker , on december 27			1
when they returned home , two policemen knocked at the door and told them their mother was in hospital			1
the detectives said that their father was in a police cell , having called 999 and confessed to strangling her			2
' i remember thinking there must be a mistake , ' she said			0
' i could n't believe @entity144 had done anything to her			0
i was in complete shock			0
i remember saying : “ are you sure it was him ? ” but they said : “ yes			0
” ' the girls immediately went to visit their mother in @entity279 , where she was in intensive care			2
but four days later , on @entity281 , they decided to switch their mother 's life support machine off			1
' i had mixed feelings seeing her at the hospital , ' said @entity1 , who had not spoken to her mother for ten months			1
she looked very tiny and vulnerable			0
a wave of emotion hit me because it was so sad			0
but we knew she was not going to wake up from the coma			0
' happier times : @entity7 and @entity11 with @entity19 in @entity293			1
the couple 's daughters said they could n't be apart but should n't have been together the funeral was held at @entity298 - on - @entity299 crematorium and the whole family attended apart from @entity1 who was in custody			1
the next time the girls saw their father was in court when he pleaded guilty to their mother 's murder			1
' we had been hoping that he would not plead guilty , ' revealed @entity1			1
' but @entity144 did n't want a trial or to see @entity51 's name dragged through the mud			0
even now he still cherishes her above all else			0
there 's no doubt he 's still in love with her			0
' since their father was jailed , both @entity1 and @entity19 have travelled a 250 - mile round trip to visit him each month			1
' it was such a lovely feeling to be able to see him after everything we had all gone through , ' explained @entity1			1
we just wanted to say to him : “ it 's ok			0
we 're not angry with you			0
” although he was in total shock – his eyes were barely focusing – you could see that he felt relieved			0
' what is surprising is that my sister and i have discovered that we are both a lot stronger than we thought we would be			0
' neither @entity19 nor i have had counselling			0
we talked about it a bit but felt we did n't need it			0
to some people it might seem strange			0
but the bond between @entity144 , @entity19 and me is stronger than ever			0
