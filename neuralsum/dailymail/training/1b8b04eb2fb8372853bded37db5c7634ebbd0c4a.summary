by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 13:09 est , 4 march 2014 @entity3 can be used to track @entity5 outbreaks and could one day help prevent them , scientists claim			1
it may be possible to predict sexual risk and drug use by monitoring tweets and mapping where they come from and comparing them with data on the geographical distribution of @entity5 cases , according to a new study			1
a team of @entity19 scientists examined almost 10,000 tweets with sexual and drug - related themes and found that their locations were a good predictor for statistics on @entity5 prevalence			1
a team of @entity19 scientists examined almost 10,000 tweets with sexual and drug - related themes and created a map of them			1
they found that their locations were a good predictor for statistics on @entity5 prevalence researchers found 8,538 tweets indicating sexually risky behaviour and 1,342 suggesting drug use			1
the states with the largest proportion of geo - located tweets denoting risky behaviour were @entity39 and @entity40 , which both had over nine per cent of the tweets			0
@entity42 had almost six per cent and @entity43 just over five per cent			0
on a per capita basis , the largest raw number of @entity5 risk – related tweets came from @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			2
‘ ultimately , these methods suggest that we can use “ big data ” from social media for remote monitoring and surveillance of @entity5 risk behaviours and potential outbreaks , ’ said @entity52 , co-director of the @entity53 at the @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity54 )			2
other studies have examined how @entity3 can be used to predict outbreaks of infections like influenza			1
‘ but this is the first to suggest that @entity3 can be used to predict people 's health - related behaviours and as a method for monitoring @entity5 risk behaviours and drug use , ’ he said			1
@entity5 is mainly spread by people having unprotected sex or sharing drug - use equipment with someone with the hiv virus			1
substance use can contribute to these risks indirectly because alcohol and other drugs can lower people ’s inhibitions and make them less likely to use condoms , @entity81 ( @entity81 ) said			0
researchers collected more than 550 million tweets between may 26 and december 9 , 2012 for the study			0
they then created an algorithm to pick out words and phrases in the tweets suggesting drug use or potentially risky behaviours , such as ‘ get high ’ and ‘ sex ’			0
the study is the first to suggest that @entity3 ( pictured ) can be used to predict people 's health - related behaviours and as a method for monitoring @entity5 risk behaviours and drug use , the researchers said the scientists plotted tweets identified as risky on a map of the @entity19 to discover where they originated and then ran statistical models to see if these were areas where @entity5 cases had been reported			1
the algorithm captured 8,538 tweets indicating sexually risky behaviour and 1,342 suggesting drug use			0
the states with the largest proportion of geo - located tweets denoting risky behaviour were @entity39 and @entity40 , which both had over nine per cent of tweets , @entity42 with almost six per cent and @entity43 with just over five per cent			0
on a per capita basis , the largest raw number of @entity5 risk – related tweets came from @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			2
when the researchers linked the tweets to data on @entity5 cases , they found a ‘ significant relationship ’ between those indicating risky behaviour and counties where the highest numbers of @entity5 cases were reported			2
this map was generated by using social media updates to pinpoint where people were suffering from flu on christmas day a @entity141 - based start - up called @entity142 created an influenza map of the @entity19 in october 2012 based on people tweeting and posting to @entity144 about their illness			2
the founder of the small firm , @entity148 , discovered that social media reports of the flu spiked 77 per cent between august and october - before the flu season was predicted to begin			0
while an increase in the number of ill people is normal during that time period , the numbers found by @entity142 were 30 per cent up from the previous year			0
social media sickness mentions are one of the few signals that can be tracked in real time as doctors attempt to understand how a sickness moves .			0

scientists from @entity54 examined almost 10,000 tweets with sexual and drug - related themes to map their locations
they found the map was a good predictor for statistics on @entity5 prevalence
other studies have examined how @entity3 can be used to predict outbreaks of infections like influenza
