in my job as a comedienne / impressionist i was lucky enough to land a job on a leg of @entity8 ' @entity7 world cruise - and brought the family along			1
the segment of the cruise we enjoyed was the five - day leg from @entity14 to @entity15			1
i am glad to say that my on - board guest entertainment act seemed to go down well - though quite what the @entity18 passengers made of my takes on the likes of @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 i 'm not too sure			1
but i , at least , really enjoyed it			2
and here 's me during a quick day off : @entity26 and their children hit the beach on @entity32 's @entity31 shoreline the job presented me with the opportunity to bring my husband and our two children , aged 11 and seven , along on a voyage in a very beautiful part of the world			1
my children were also able to see my act - so that they could finally understand what i do for a living			1
we liked the fact that the cruise was very @entity47 : the voyage 's itinerary begins and ends in @entity50 , so the majority of passengers were from the @entity47 - and on - board activities were run largely to satisfy @entity47 tastes			1
my initial pleasure at being on a cruise ship was the realisation that i was to be relieved of my usual domestic chores : it was very nice , for example , to take a break from vacuuming ! islands of inspiration : @entity32 's @entity31 archipelago has some of the @entity65 's loveliest beaches we stopped twice on our short trip , firstly in @entity67 , which serves @entity32 's capital @entity69			1
the following day we got to see a little bit of the beautiful archipelago of @entity31			2
the day we stopped there was my husband 's birthday , so we decided to enjoy it on the beach			2
what i love about cruising is the fact that you get a taster of these different places			2
ever wondered what @entity32 is like ? on a cruise you can find out in a few hours			1
another surprise for first - time cruisers is that the ship is a selfcontained world of its own , with everything you could possibly want to enjoy the perfect holiday			2
the food on board , for instance , is a key attraction			2
dining in the restaurant was a pleasure , not just because of the cuisine but also because of the staff : the waiters were just lovely			0
our kids loved one of them so much they actually said : ' can we keep in touch with him ? ' one of the things you often hear is that people put on half a stone during a cruise			0
not me : i actually lost 6lb in a week			0
i know that sounds ridiculous and it sounds as if i did n't like the dishes served , but i really did			0
i found that there was so much choice and i naturally gravitated towards the healthier options			0
where , at home , i can be a bit lazy and just grab a calorific sandwich , on board the @entity7 i was able to enjoy healthy salads and fruits			0
a big boat for a brilliant family holiday : @entity26 sailed on the @entity8 liner @entity7 the kids also ate well because , again , there was a lot of choice for them , and because it was all so beautifully presented they were willing to try things they had never eaten before			1
it helped that they spent most of their days in the pool and were very hungry when meal times came around			0
we had a few days in @entity15 at the end of the tour and joined some great excursions			1
we really enjoyed our visit to @entity140 , for example			0
i would love to go back to @entity14 , our ' taster ' visit really made us want to return			0
there was an excursion to the zoo which we did n't get to do , and we would have loved to visit the street markets too			0
cruising is like the best showbusiness act - it leaves you wanting more ! like my act , hopefully … @entity8 ( @entity153 ; 0843 374 0111 ) offers fly - cruises in @entity155 and the @entity156			1
prices start at £ 2,039 , with £ 40 per person on - board spend , for an 11 - night adult - only cruise on @entity161 departing march 25 with full board and entertainment			0
return flights and transfers cost from £ 890 per person .			0
