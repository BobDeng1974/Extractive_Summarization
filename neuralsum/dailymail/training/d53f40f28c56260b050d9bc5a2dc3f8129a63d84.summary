by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the omens are not good for @entity3 as they prepare to take on @entity4 in their pivotal @entity6 game on thursday			1
win and qualification is in their hands			0
lose and , chances are , they 'll be on the plane home			0
one slightly unexpected major hurdle for the @entity15 , though , could be the curse of @entity17			0
harrowing : @entity18 and @entity19 will be hoping to beat the curse of @entity17 on thursday night @entity20 : @entity21 and @entity22 will be hoping to bring pain to the @entity15 and , for once , it has nothing to do with @entity26			2
the record shows that , when @entity3 have played at the @entity6 on the commercial broadcaster , their record is significantly worse than it is when they are televised on the @entity32			2
since the 1982 @entity6 , @entity17 have shown 10 @entity6 first round group stage games , of which @entity3 have failed to win seven ( six draws , one defeat )			1
switching channels to @entity32 , however , and @entity3 fare far better with a record of eight wins out of 12 - although one of their two defeats was the 2 - 1 loss at the hands of @entity42 last saturday			0
@entity43 : @entity44 scored against @entity45 the last time @entity3 won on @entity17 in the first round pain : what happened the only time @entity17 have exclusively screened an @entity3 @entity6 knockout ... perhaps most disturbingly , though , @entity17 have shown just one @entity3 first round group stage win in the last 32 years , and that was the 2 - 0 victory over minnows @entity45 in 2006			1
@entity3 did n't play a knockout game in 1982 , due to the thankfully defunct second group stage ( @entity32 and @entity17 both screened a 0 - 0 draw apiece ) , but since @entity57 ' 86 @entity17 have shown just one knockout tie exclusively - which ended in heartache after losing on penalties to @entity61 in 1998			1
it 's a harrowing record to say the least , and it 's a curse that will hopefully be broken against @entity4 on thursday night .			0

@entity3 set to take on @entity4 in *crunch* @entity6 game on thursday
*history* shows that @entity15 have failed to win seven of last 10 first round group games to be shown on @entity17
@entity32 , however , have a far better record of showing @entity3 victories
