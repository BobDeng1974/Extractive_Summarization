seventeen years after @entity1 decided to become the first state to hold all elections with mail - in ballots , it took another pioneering step on monday to broaden participation by automatically registering people to vote			1
gov. @entity8 signed a bill that puts the burden of registration on the state instead of voters			1
under the legislation , every adult citizen in @entity1 who has interacted with the driver and @entity16 since 2013 but has n't registered to vote will receive a ballot in the mail at least 20 days before the next statewide election			1
the measure is expected to add about 300,000 new voters to the rolls			1
eligible @entity24 will get postcards saying they 've been registered and have three weeks to opt out			2
they 'll automatically be registered as ' unaffiliated ' but can select a political party on the postcard and return it to election officials through the mail			2
they can also choose to cancel their voter registration entirely			0
@entity1 gov. @entity8 signed an automatic voter registration bill on monday , march 16 ; @entity1 has been holding elections by mail for 17 years @entity1 @entity36 are already angry about the possibility for voter fraud – millions of ballots will be in mailboxes with limited control over what happens to them – along with the cost of implementing the measure and whether the @entity46 can ensure personal information remains secure			1
information the @entity46 has on file , such as age , residential information , signature and citizenship status , will be transferred to the secretary of state , who will then automatically update registration information			0
but more than anything , @entity1 's new law changes an ' opt - in ' voting system to one where people can only choose to ' opt out			1
' ' it just changes expectations for who 's responsible for making elections work , ' said @entity65 , a professor of political science at the @entity67 in @entity68 and director of the @entity70			2
' in every other state it 's the responsibility for the voters to make sure it happens			2
' some other states have considered such legislation but none has gone as far as @entity1			2
@entity78 nearly implemented automatic voter registration in 2009 before the plan was vetoed by gov. @entity81 , who said ' registering to vote should be a voluntary , intentional act			2
' similar concerns were raised by @entity1 's minority republicans			1
' simply because it makes us unique or makes us first does not necessarily mean that it actually improves on what we 're doing , ' said state sen. @entity89 , a @entity36 from @entity90			0
when it came up for a vote in the @entity94 last week , all @entity36 and one @entity91 voted against it			0
the @entity96 hold a 18 - 12 advantage in the @entity94 so the bill easily passed			0
state sen. @entity99 , a @entity100 @entity91 who carried the bill in the @entity94 , said there were rumblings the measure was a ' secret plot ' to enroll more democrats			0
but she denied that was true			0
@entity1 already has one of the highest voter registration rates in the nation — 73 percent of @entity24 were registered to vote and 70 percent of them cast ballots during the 2014 general election			1
@entity113 , spokesman for the secretary of state , said the legislation is expected to eventually capture all unregistered voters who are in the @entity46 database after taking actions such as obtaining or renewing a driver 's license			0
two years ago , when the measure was first proposed , @entity113 said there were questions about whether the @entity125 records were confidential under federal law			0
the legislative counsel determined the secretary of state and the division could share information as long as it was for legitimate government purposes , he said			0
accidental governor : @entity8 's predecessor , @entity133 , resigned after his fiancee was accused of using her influence with the governor to benefit clients of her eco-consulting company @entity1 's move will result in about 300,000 ballots being sent through the mail to people who will be automatically registered to vote automatic registration is not uncommon in other countries			1
a 2009 report by the @entity145 says nations where the government takes the lead in enrolling voters have much higher registration rates			0
@entity151 has a 100 percent registration rate , while @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 all have registration rates over 90 percent			0
@entity157 , deputy director of the @entity145 's @entity158 , said a state needs to already have reliable agency records of eligible @entity161 who have demonstrated citizenship in order to successfully follow in @entity1 's footsteps			1
@entity1 only grants driver 's licenses to people who can prove they 're in the @entity161 legally by presenting passports , birth certificates or other documents			1
@entity171 , a spokesman for the @entity125 , has said the agency can separate citizens from noncitizens based on those documents			0
@entity24 were the first to see all - mail elections , and the state has since been followed by @entity177 and @entity178			0
' @entity1 is a true leader in accessibility to voting and i challenge every other state in this nation to examine their policies and find ways to ensure there are as few barriers as possible in the way of the citizen 's right to vote , ' @entity8 said			1
@entity8 took office last month after her predecesor @entity133 resigned over ethics allegations involving his fiancee - adviser and a string of government contracts .			1

ballots will be sent to about 300,000 new voters , whether or not they want them
