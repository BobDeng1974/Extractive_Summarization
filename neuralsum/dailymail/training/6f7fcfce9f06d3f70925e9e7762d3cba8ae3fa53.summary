the smiling model in the advert for the @entity3 anti-age cream looked remarkably youthful for her 60 - plus years			2
but for a few crow ’s feet around her eyes and the hint of a crease on her forehead , she might easily have passed for 20 years younger			0
in fact the image had been so comprehensively retouched and digitally enhanced that it bore little resemblance to the real woman			0
before ... @entity18 model @entity17 , 62 , who did not start modelling until she was 49 and has boasted that ' what you see is what you get ' now the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) has banned the print advert on the basis that it was misleading and exaggerated the effect of using the cream			1
the @entity18 model , @entity17 , has been presented as a champion of older women			1
the 62 - year - old did not start modelling until she was 49 and has boasted in interviews that ‘ what you see is what you get ’			1
however , the reality of modern marketing is that virtually no advertising image escapes the digital scalpel to remove imperfections			2
the press ad for @entity44 , which is sold by boots at £ 8.66 for a 50ml jar , included the claim that it ‘ reduces all major signs of mature skin ageing ’ and that it ‘ visibly reduces wrinkles , improves firmness and helps prevent age spots ’			2
... and after : miss @entity54 as she appeared in the anti-age cream advert , which has been banned by the @entity24 alongside the beaming , perfect image of the older woman , the claims went further : ‘ @entity60 ’			1
the pack stated : ‘ reduces all major signs of mature skin ageing ' and ' gives mature skin the extra care it deserves '			0
but an @entity24 investigation following a complaint found the image was created through computer trickery rather than using the cream			1
the @entity24 said the manufacturer , @entity71 of @entity72 , had failed to provide evidence to back up the many claimed effects of using the moisturising cream			1
in a damning assessement of the ad , the authority said : ‘ we considered that the image of the older model , who was in the centre of the shot , had undergone extensive retouching resulting in substantial changes to the model ’s appearance			1
‘ lines and wrinkles on her face , particularly around the eye and mouth area , had been dramatically reduced , and several age spots had been removed			0
misleading : a 2010 advert for @entity96 which was banned by the @entity24 ‘ in the absence of evidence demonstrating that that effect was in line with that which could be achieved through use of the product , we concluded that the ad misleadingly exaggerated the performance of the product in relation to the claims ‘ anti-age ’			1
a @entity44 spokesman said : ‘ we regret the fact that this image has been considered misleading , as this was never our intention			0
’ this was not the first time @entity44 has fallen foul of advertising rules			0
in 2010 the @entity24 banned a cinema ad for ‘ @entity120 ’ for giving the misleading impression that 37 per cent of women using the cream felt more beautiful than they had when they were ten years younger			1
campaign : mp @entity125 says excessive airbrushing puts pressure on women to achieve impossible ideals other beauty brands have been found guilty of manipulating images to exaggerate their anti-ageing effects			0
in 2009 , a magazine advertisement for @entity133 was banned after an image of the model @entity136 , who was 60 at the time , was airbrushed to soften the wrinkles around her eyes			2
two years ago , an ad for ‘ @entity145 ’ foundation by the @entity144 brand @entity143 was criticised by the @entity24 for manipulating of images of the actress @entity147			1
it was banned , along with another featuring @entity149 for a @entity151 foundation on the grounds of excessive airbrushing			2
the @entity154 mp and @entity156 minister , @entity125 , has campaigned against the use of airbrushing in marketing , claiming it puts unfair pressure on women			0
before joining the government , she said : ‘ we believe in the freedom of companies to advertise but we also believe in the freedom of women to be as comfortable as possible with their bodies			0
‘ they should n’t constantly feel the need to measure up to a very narrow range of digitally manipulated pictures			0

@entity24 says ad uses too much digital airbrushing
model @entity17 has boasted in interviews : ' what you see is what you get '
print ad has now been banned
