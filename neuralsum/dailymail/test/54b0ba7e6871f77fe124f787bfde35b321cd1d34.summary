ask @entity0 why he believes boxing to be the greatest sport of all and there is no mention of the $ 120 million or more he will be paid for going toe - to - toe with @entity7 in the most lucrative fist fight in history			1
rather , his mind goes back to when the @entity0 was the @entity11 , a 12 - year - old urchin in the mud of the @entity14 whose mother was eking out the food for the family			1
‘ somebody told me and my friends some fights were being put on in the town , ’ he recalls			2
‘ i did not know what boxing was but they said they you got a prize whatever the result			2
two hundred pesos ( two dollars ) to win , a hundred to lose			2
’ @entity0 was the star attraction as he held an open workout in @entity31 on wednesday @entity0 was in good spirits as he showed off his skills for the gathered crowd at the @entity36 gym @entity0 addressed gathered media and talked about his upcoming may 2 fight with @entity7 @entity39 opened up about his motivation , his belief in @entity42 and journey to the top in boxing @entity39 works out in the ring in front of the world 's media @entity0 does some pad work with trainer @entity51 @entity0 held an open training session at the @entity36 gym in @entity54 the @entity14 star works on his body shots with @entity51 ' so we went and i won			1
i took the two dollars home and gave them to my mother so she could put more food on the table			0
but when she asked where i got the money i did n’t tell her it was for fighting			0
‘ we went back every sunday and i kept winning the two dollars			0
then my uncle came with a stack of videos and i watched @entity73 and @entity74 and @entity75 and so many others			0
’ and so it began			0
‘ boxing is the best sport because it teaches you about life , ’ he says			2
‘ it taught me you will receive if you give back			0
’ it is a lesson he wants to pass on to @entity7			1
‘ when this fight is finished i would like us to sit down quietly together to talk , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i want to speak to him about the @entity87 and how everything we get is a gift from @entity42			0
how we are the stewards of this blessing and should use it for good			0
’ @entity0 and his trainer @entity51 ( right ) do some padwork as the media gather to watch @entity0 showed off his impressive speed - which he will hope will trouble @entity7 @entity0 looked calm and content as he went through his stretching and warm - up routine @entity0 and @entity51 take a break from the workout as they prepare for the biggest fight of their lives twenty - four hours earlier the equivalent story told by @entity7 was of how he told those close to him that he would become the first boxer to earn more than a hundred million bucks in a night			1
and since he is reputed to spend his fortunes on fast cars , fast living and fast women , this may seem an unlikely post-fight reunion			0
but the @entity0 smooths the way to the @entity116 by saying : ‘ @entity7 deserves his money because he ’s earned it			1
he has the right to use it his way			0
but i would like to tell him how good it feels to help people who need it , like giving them plots of land and the houses they build on them			0
’ @entity0 ’s generosity to his impoverished countrymen is as legendary as @entity7 ’s excesses , although it should be stressed that @entity128 is a charitable benefactor himself			1
but there is a difference , also , in their view of their craft			0
@entity7 admits that he has fallen out of love with boxing and regards it now as a business			1
@entity0 says : ‘ boxing is still my passion			1
i do it to please the fans , to give them excitement in return for their support			2
i am not a materialist			0
@entity0 started to warm - up in front of the gathered crowd after first speaking to the media ( right ) @entity0 opened up about his journey from fighting in the @entity14 to the richest boxing bout in history @entity0 says he wants to entertain the fans and has warned @entity7 that his killer instinct is back ‘ now we have one of the biggest fights in history			1
but it ’s not about how much we will be paid			0
whether it ’s two dollars or a hundred million dollars - it ’s what you do with it			0
’ @entity7 suspects that @entity166 determination to give the fans their money ’s worth – especially when they will be forking out huge amounts in @entity170 on may to watch their @entity171 – may be his downfall			1
he describes @entity0 as a reckless fighter , citing his shocking ko by @entity175 as proof			1
the @entity0 responds : ‘ we would be nothing without the fans and this fight would not be so big			1
so we should entertain them			0
yes , sometimes there is a price to pay , but it is worth it			0
’ there is method to what @entity7 regards as madness			1
@entity128 morphed into mr @entity188 by virtue of one of the most clever defences ever erected in the prize - ring			0
@entity0 says : ‘ boxing is about punching			1
’ @entity0 's trainer roach was also much sought after at the @entity36 gym in @entity31 @entity51 had concerns that @entity0 led too busy a lifestyle and it was previously affecting his performances he would like to draw his rival as the best pound - for - pound boxer into an open fight : ‘ if he comes to try to knock me out it would be good for me			1
‘ but whatever happens it should be a better fight than five years ago , when everyone says it should have happened			2
we are fully developed as fighters and the world is watching now			0
’ @entity7 keeps insisting it is ‘ just another fight			1
’ @entity0 says : ‘ i ’m excited			1
no , this fight will not define my career			2
that is done by all my accomplishments in becoming the only eight - division world champion			0
but winning this will be a big additional achievement for my legacy , ’ he did bridle when @entity7 ’s @entity225 insinuated that he had risen through the weights with the help of chemical substances , which was why he challenged his opponent that if one of them tested positive for drugs that man should pay the other $ 5 million			1
it was an offer @entity7 refused			1
@entity0 's promoter @entity235 talks to the media ahead of the fight with @entity7 in may but perhaps , naturally charming though he is and endlessly obliging to all and sundry , a little of that resentment is driving him on			1
his trainer @entity51 had been concerned that in rediscovering @entity42 and purifying his life - style he may have lost some of his bite – and hence the drop in knock - out ratio			2
@entity0 says ; ‘ my determination to win has never been higher than for this fight			1
my killer instinct is back			0
’ at this very moment his pet @entity250 , also called @entity0 and who accompanies him everywhere including the gym , barks			2
loudly enough to be heard above the frenzied clamour of his master ’s media day at @entity51 ’s iconic @entity36 gym in @entity54			2
@entity0 grins : ‘ it ’s nothing personal with @entity7			1
we are just fighting for many things			0
’ @entity7 hit the pads with uncle @entity261 during a media workout at his @entity170 gym on tuesday @entity7 revealed he is no longer enjoying his boxing and sees the sport more as a business now @entity7 works to the body with co-trainer @entity268 in front of a huge crowd at his gym there is no re-match clause in the contract and @entity7 has expressed no appetite for there to be a second fight			1
but for @entity0 one good reason would be for him to even up split of the gigantic purse			2
‘ i am not happy to have conceded 60 - 40 per cent to @entity7 , ’ he says			2
‘ negotiating would be easier for the re-match			0
to make this happen we had to give him everything he wanted			0
if there is a next time it would be a different deal			0
i can not see anyone going hungry and not help them			0
’ once again , his mind is taking him back 24 years to the @entity14 and those two - dollar fights .			2

@entity0 held a media workout at the famous @entity296
he is just over two weeks away from facing @entity7 on may 2
@entity0 will earn more than $ 120m from the richest fight in boxing
but @entity0 says he is not materialistic and fights to please the fans
@entity304 : @entity0 has style but @entity7 ' will find a way to win '
