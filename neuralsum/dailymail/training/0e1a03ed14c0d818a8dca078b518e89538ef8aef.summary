by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 06:54 est , 13 december 2013 if you 're struggling to find a @entity2 present for an avid @entity4 fan , look no further			0
@entity6 , the company set up by @entity4 , is set to release a new 59 - track album next week , just in time for the festive season - and it 's all thanks to @entity10 copyright laws			1
although it will not include some of the more fabled @entity4 recordings - such as @entity13 , or a 28 - minute version of @entity16 - @entity4 enthusiasts will no doubt be excited by the prospect of alternate versions of early classic such as @entity20 and she loves you			1
a new 59 - track album of @entity4 material is to be released by @entity6 next week - thanks to @entity10 copyright laws the new release will include 44 songs recorded for the @entity26 as well as previously unreleased studio outtakes the release has been prompted by copyright laws , which mean that unreleased music loses its copyright – and can therefore be taken for free and even sold by others – after 50 years			1
the album , to be released next tuesday by @entity33 , will include performances recorded for the @entity26 and studio outtakes			1
@entity36 will also include demonstration recordings of two songs that the band eventually gave to other artists			2
this will see @entity42 and @entity43 's @entity44 , which became a number one hit for @entity47 , and @entity42 ’s piano demo of @entity49 , released by the same band , available on @entity51			2
@entity26 sessions of familiar songs such as @entity55 , all made half a century ago , are included on the track list , which has appeared on @entity58 - based @entity4 blog , @entity59			2
the website , which reported the release , suggested that the collection is an effort to give the material copyright protection and stop it falling into the public domain			0
last month , after campaigning led by sir @entity70 , the @entity68 government backed an extension to @entity10 copyright laws			1
this means that the copyright on released music recordings has been extended to last from 50 years to 70 years			1
however , the copyright for non-released music recordings remains at 50 years			1
this , @entity4 fans believe , is why @entity6 has decided to release this bootleg album of 1963 recordings - shortly before the tracks ' copyright would expire			2
the tracks would only be given protection following an official release			0
this latest batch of tracks comes little over a month after a selection of recordings from archive @entity26 sessions hit the shelves			2
the new selection includes multiple appearances for some tracks ( there are three different takes of there 's a place , for example )			0
for music recordings , @entity10 copyright laws were last month extended from 50 to 70 years ’ protection , but this does not include unreleased tracks			1
therefore , unreleased @entity4 recordings from 1963 will legally lose their copyright in 2014			0
it means that @entity4 fans can hope for releases of the 28 - minute @entity16 and their famous performance of @entity13 from 1967 in the next few years			0
the releases of previously unsold music could become a trend , thanks to the @entity10 copyright law			1
last year , for instance , @entity113 released an 86 - song @entity116 album , shamelessly entitled the @entity118 1			0
this was then followed up by the release of the 50th @entity121			0
the release is believed to have been brought about because copyright on unreleased music expires after 50 years the album is to be released next tuesday by @entity33 and will be available on @entity51 only the new album will include 44 recordings from 275 live performances for the @entity26 , all in 1963			1
in addition , there will be four versions of she loves you and three of there 's a place			0
of the five versions of @entity20 , one was recorded for the @entity26 's @entity137 , two for @entity4 and one for @entity138			2
@entity4 blogger @entity139 said on his blog , @entity59 : ' with the new release , @entity6 and @entity33 are saying that they now want to make money from this kind of material			0
' but more importantly , the stuff they are still keeping in the vaults must now still be stuff they do n't want to profit from , and bootlegging of that material could still be defended morally			0

@entity36 includes five versions of @entity20 and four of she loves you
the @entity51 - only album , which will include live @entity26 recordings and studio outtakes , is released next tuesday by @entity33
prompted by @entity10 copyright laws , which state that unreleased music loses copyright after 50 years
