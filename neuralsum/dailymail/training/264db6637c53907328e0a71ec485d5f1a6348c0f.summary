they have seen flaws in the awesome machine			1
the time has come to capitalise			2

but i do n’t get any sense there ’s an aura that ca n’t be broken down by our boys , because preparation and knowledge dispel that type of fear			2
‘ they believe this @entity0 side is their team and they ’re trying to make their own aura			1
of course , that ’s still in the development stage but we ’re going to get there			0
’ the countdown to this momentous fixture has been dominated by profound disruption to @entity101 plans			0

among the tight forwards in particular , the losses have been acute , with @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 among the missing men			2
in addition , @entity0 are without @entity116 and @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			1
others such as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 have been deemed not ready for selection after recent injuries			0

@entity42 , the @entity0 head coach , looks on during training at @entity8 ahead of saturday 's tie @entity0 's @entity63 : ' they believe this @entity0 side is their team and they ’re trying to make their own aura ' @entity133 ( pictured ) and his @entity0 assistants have had to cope with injuries to several key players @entity137 , episode 1 but the management have not lamented the absentees and that is the right tone to set as they still have considerable firepower			1
supported by the world ’s richest union , the national team have so much in their favour which must be translated on to the scoreboard			0
@entity0 have greater depth in many positions than at any time in recent memory			1
the side contain sufficient power , quality and nous to stand toe to toe with the world ’s leading nation			0
but that is not enough			0

so the only outcome this saturday afternoon that would signify progress is victory			0
@entity42 advances the ‘ aggregate of marginal gains ’ philosophy employed by @entity170			1
well , this is the sort of occasion when the gain must be measured in match points			0
two more — based on that 28 - 27 reverse in @entity40 — will do it			0
@entity0 have revamped their changing rooms and shirts in an effort to evoke history and national pride			2
they have engaged the @entity8 crowd through innovations such as the team walk through the car park			2
they have had inspirational guest speakers , an upgrade of their training facilities and good player access — founded on a strong rapport with the clubs			0
that has translated into delayed squad announcements so that form can be considered			0
they have also enhanced their attacking game plan			0
there is no escaping the @entity9 ’ experience advantage but @entity133 is convinced that youthful vigour can prevail			2
there was a nagging sense of @entity54 unrest in june that their revered test team were showing small signs of decline			0
since then , @entity9 have lost to the @entity207 and drawn with @entity208			2
they are mere mortals , and @entity0 can beat them if their mental strength is as robust as @entity63 says and they hit the intense heights of 2012			1
this is a tipping point			0
defeat would be a fifth in a row against these opponents and @entity0 would go into next week ’s showdown against @entity207 with a growing sense of desperation			2
@entity220 would create timely momentum and ignite the hosts ’ @entity15 preparations			0
the next marginal gain @entity133 needs is a famous result			0
@entity226 of @entity9 tests himself during a kicking practice session at @entity8 on friday @entity0 have revamped their changing rooms and shirts in an effort to evoke history and national pride the @entity9 arrive as mere mortals and @entity0 can sense a win is close if they perform like they can everything is in place as @entity0 look to add their name to the prestigious list of those who beat the @entity9			1
