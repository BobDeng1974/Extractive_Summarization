he then claimed he was owed ' about $ 500 million by the communist @entity6 government			2
' ' we 'll be suing them and they 'll be answering the questions			0
we 've had ... an arbitration against these @entity6 mongrels - i 'm saying that because they 're communist , they shoot their own people , they have n't got a justice system and they want to take over this country			1
