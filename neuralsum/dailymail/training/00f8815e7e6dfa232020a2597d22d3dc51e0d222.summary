@entity1 screeners at @entity2 lost a woman who reportedly tested positive for explosives on sunday and only put the airport on lock - down when she boarded a flight to @entity8 , @entity9			1
earlier in the day , the @entity1 at the airport misplaced a piece of checked luggage that had also tested positive for explosives and could n't find it for 45 minutes			1
the bomb squad cleared the oversize bag -- but only two and a half hours after it was discovered			2
the security failures caused more than 100 flights at the busy airport to be cancelled and dozens more delayed as furious passengers waited for hours -- only to learn their planes were not going to take off			1
@entity35 5 @entity34 reported that the woman was flagged in a preliminary test for explosives			2
the @entity1 refused to comment on the report that possible explosives were involved			1
security officials somehow lost track of the woman and allowed her into the terminal			1
that 's when officials put the airport on lock down ' out of an abundance of caution , ' according to a @entity1 statement			2
authorities only realized the woman had boarded her flight once it had already landed in @entity8 , the @entity52 reported			1
the woman was never questioned or screened again and officials do not know her name or identity			0
two hours prior , at 6.30am , a routine screening flagged an over-sized checked bag as possibly containing explosives , @entity60 reports			1
grounded : the security breach brought flights at @entity2 to a halt on sunday -- but this was not the first time this has happened that bag also slipped through the hands of security agents and made it to the tarmac , where it sat for more than 45 minutes before it was discovered			1
the @entity77 bomb squad was called and inspected the bag two hours later and found no threat			0
this is only the latest blunder for the @entity1 in @entity2			0
in june , eight screeners were fired sleeping on duty after photos emerged of a @entity1 employee reportedly dozing in front of a monitor when she was supposed to be looking out for bombs			2
the @entity1 at @entity2 is headed by @entity87 , who has been in the post a little over a year			0

a spokeswoman said only that the agency was going to ' review the situation			0
' passengers on sunday were furious about the cancellations			0
' they should be on their game			0
if we have to go through this massive process -- we have to take off our shoes and go through the possibility of being strip - searched the least they can do is to do their jobs if we 're going to go through all of that , ' said one angry flier			0
