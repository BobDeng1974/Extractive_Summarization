author ] scientists have warned that the collapse of bee colonies could trigger a farming crisis , but why populations are being hit so hard has remained largely a mystery			2
now one group of experts has proved that two widely used neonicotinoids - a class of insecticide – harm honeybee colonies over the winter , particularly when temperatures drop			1
@entity15 revealed that even low doses of an insecticide called clothianidin had an adverse effect on hives			1
although @entity23 / @entity22 was carried to the brain of the honeybee ( stock image ) , it had no effect on the insect , which suggests the highly selective spider venom toxin does not interact with the calcium channels in the bee there are only enough honeybees in @entity35 to properly pollinate a quarter of the country ’s crops , scientists claim			2
destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees , which are vital for food production			0
professor @entity47 of the @entity48 , who led the research project , said : ‘ we face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now			0
’ the research , published in the journal @entity54 , found that @entity55 has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops			1
bee populations have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides			0
previous studies have estimated that the number of @entity35 honeybees have halved over the last 25 years			0
scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination			0
the study by the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) in @entity72 , @entity73 , strengthens the scientists ’ findings from last year that low doses of imidacloprid - another neonicotinoid - are linked to colony collapse disorder ( ccd ) where bees abandon their hives over the winter and eventually die			1
although other studies have suggested that @entity80 - related mortality in honeybee colonies may come from bees ’ reduced resistance to mites or parasites as a result of exposure to pesticides , the new study found that bees in the hives exhibiting @entity80 had almost identical levels of pathogen infestation as a group of control hives , most of which survived the winter			1
this finding suggests that the neonicotinoids are causing some other kind of biological mechanism in bees that in turn leads to ccd , according to the study , published in the @entity110			1
‘ we demonstrated again in this study that neonicotinoids are highly likely to be responsible for triggering ccd in honeybee hives that were healthy prior to the arrival of winter , ’ said lead author @entity111 , associate professor of environmental exposure biology at @entity71			1
the new pesticide , @entity118 / gna , has no effect on bees ' learning , which is key to their foraging for food			2
researchers said that the chemical cocktail has potential as an environmentally friendly ' bee safe ' pesticide and an alternative to those suspected of decimating colonies			0
a stock image of crop spraying is pictured since 2006 , there have been significant losses of honeybees from @entity80			2
pinpointing the cause is crucial to mitigating this problem since bees are prime pollinators of roughly one - third of all crops worldwide			0
experts have considered a number of possible causes , including pathogen infestation , beekeeping practices , and pesticide exposure			0
recent findings suggest that @entity80 is related specifically to neonicotinoids including imidacloprid and clothianidin , which may impair bees ’ neurological functions			1
together with experts from the @entity155 , the scientists studied the health of 18 honeybee colonies in three locations in central @entity73 between october 2012 and april 2013			1
at each location , the researchers separated six colonies into three groups - one treated with imidacloprid , one with clothianidin and one untreated			2
there was a steady decline in the size of all the bee colonies at the beginning of winter , which is typical among hives during the colder months in @entity171			2
the battle bee - gins : since 2006 , there have been significant losses of honey bees ( pictured ) from @entity80			2
pinpointing the cause is crucial to mitigating this problem since bees are prime pollinators of roughly one - third of all crops worldwide beginning in january 2013 , honeybee populations in the control colonies began to increase as expected , but populations in the neonicotinoid - treated hives continued to decline			1
by april 2013 , half of the neonicotinoid - treated colonies were lost with abandoned hives that are typical of ccd			1
while the 12 pesticide - treated hives in the current study experienced a 50 per cent ccd mortality rate , the authors noted that in their 2012 study , bees in pesticide - treated hives had a much higher ccd mortality rate of 94 per cent			1
that earlier bee die - off occurred during the particularly cold and prolonged winter of 2010 - 2011 , leading the authors to speculate that colder temperatures , in combination with neonicotinoids , may play a role in the severity of @entity80			1
‘ although we have demonstrated the validity of the association between neonicotinoids and ccd in this study , future research could help elucidate the biological mechanism that is responsible for linking sub-lethal neonicotinoid exposures to @entity80 , ’ said professor @entity111			1
‘ hopefully we can reverse the continuing trend of honeybee loss			0
’ in a bid to stop the rapid decline , experts fitted ‘ backpack ’ sensors to 5,000 bees in @entity220 in january to unravel why colonies there do not seem to be affected by the ‘ colony collapse disorder ’ that is decimating bee populations in other countries			1
the research aims to improve honey bee pollination and productivity on farms as well			0
scientists at the @entity231 ( @entity231 ) fitted 5,000 tiny sensors , measuring just 2.5mm squared to the backs of honeybees in @entity235 , @entity236 , before releasing them into the wild			0
it is the first time such large numbers of insects have been used for environmental monitoring			0
‘ honeybees play a vital role in the landscape through a free pollination service for agriculture , which various crops rely on to increase yields ’ said @entity231 science leader dr @entity243 , who is heading up the swarm sensing project			0
‘ a recent @entity231 study showed bee pollination in @entity255 beans can lead to a productivity increase of 17 per cent			0
‘ around one third of the food we eat relies on pollination , but honeybee populations around the world are crashing because of the dreaded @entity264 mite and @entity80			2
the research will also look at the impacts of agricultural pesticides on honeybees by monitoring insects that feed at sites with trace amounts of commonly used chemicals			0

@entity278 scientists have proved that two widely used neonicotinoids - a class of insecticide – harm honeybee colonies
low doses of an insecticide called clothianidin had an adverse effect on hives - particularly in cold winters
finding strengthens a previous study that found low doses of imidacloprid - another neonicotinoid - are linked to colony collapse disorder ( ccd )
@entity80 causes to bees abandon their hives over the winter and die
