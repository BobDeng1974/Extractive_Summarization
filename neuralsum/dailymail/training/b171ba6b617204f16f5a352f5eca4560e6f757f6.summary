it sounds like something from a science fiction film , but a pill to counter the ageing process could become a reality			2
scientists in @entity7 are testing a new formula , which they claim can delay the start of the ageing process			1
they hope the tablet , which is being tested on rats , mice , fish and dogs , will allow people to live to at least 120			1
they are testing a new formula on rats , mice , fish and dogs , which they claim can delay the ageing process researcher dr @entity28 , from the @entity27 project , said : ' a lot of aging diseases developed much slower			1
' the scientists are using a ' new type of antioxidant ' , which they hope will impact on on the mitochondria , the energy - producing part of cells , which is seen as triggering ageing			1
' the mitochondria are to be blamed for heart attacks , they are linked to diseases like @entity43 's and @entity44 's , ' he said			1
dr @entity28 , from the @entity27 said if successful , '' t will be possible to postpone old age ' he pointed to the naked mole - rat of east @entity48 renowned for longevity and evidently immune to cancer			0
a realistic goal was to aim for a life span for humans of 120 , and anti-ageing medication was ' technically possible ' , he told @entity56 newspaper			0
' i do n't believe we will be able to live to 800 , ' he said			0
' most probably , some new disease will emerge , let 's say , a typical disease for a 120 - year - old			2
' that was the case with cancer , which was a rare disease when ancient people died much younger			0
' the @entity7 tests have not led to an significant life span increase , but delayed the onset of ageing , he said			2
' if it turns out that diseases develop more slowly , our idea to fight aging through mitochondria is the right one , added dr @entity28 , who has been working to perfect his treatment for decades			0
' it will be possible to postpone old age			0

@entity7 scientists have tested a new formula on rats , mice , fish and dogs
they are using a new type of antioxidant which will impact on mitochondria
these are the energy - producing part of cells , thought to trigger ageing
mitochondria can be blamed for heart attacks and are linked to @entity43 's
