by @entity1 reporter published : 02:15 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 06:03 est , 13 may 2013 @entity2 has sparked an unwelcome debate it was a call for road safety - but pleas for a speed - limit may have damaged one of @entity10 's political parties in their fight to challenge chancellor @entity12			1
the opposition centre - left @entity13 have hit a bump in their campaign trail after its national chairman @entity2 called for a national speed limit			1
but his suggestion - based on his belief that a 75mph limit would reduce accidents and fatalities - has caused outrage			1
@entity10 treasures its unrestricted autobahns that cover the country			0
now the @entity13 's candidate for @entity10 chancellor , @entity27 , is trying to quash the debate , as it could be a potential turnoff for voters			1
mr @entity2 was quoted last wednesday as saying that a 75 mph ( 120 kph ) autobahn limit would make sense because statistics suggest it would reduce serious accidents			2
mr @entity27 , whose party trails in the polls , told @entity38 television there already are limits on most of autobahns			0
he said ' it 's not the time to reignite this debate , ' - perhaps in response to many voters enjoying the unrestricted limit , the @entity42 reported			0
mr @entity2 's only support for the suggestion came from the @entity51 , which backs a national limit , and the @entity53 of @entity10 ( vcd ) , which claims that 70 per cent of fatal road accidents occur on unrestricted sections of the autobahns			1
on the road : some autobahns are unrestricted - and treasured by @entity10 motorists most @entity60 countries would welcome a speed limit			1
the @entity10 's gaffe came after one of @entity66 's police and crime commissioner apologised after saying speed limits on motorways and main roads should be scrapped and skilled drivers allowed to drive as fast they like			2
@entity71 who is independent @entity72 for @entity73 , was criticised in april after saying : ‘ we ought to drive to road conditions rather than set limits			0
' the problem is there ’s so many signs			0
' you are driving along and you get mesmerised by them and you get situations where you get a 50 [ limit ] , to 40 , to 30 and it goes to 20 and back up again			0
' if we 're going to do something about speed and villages , we ought to just take all the signs down and say all villages are 30mph , or whatever it ’s going to be , and you drive on roads – like they do in @entity10 and @entity94 – as road conditions say			2
