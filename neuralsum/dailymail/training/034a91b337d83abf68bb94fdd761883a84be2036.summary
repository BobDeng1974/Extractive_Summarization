while our own moon may be thought of as difficult for man to visit , researchers say @entity4 's has a whole lot more to kill off any unsuspecting visitors			0
researchers have found gigantic polar clouds of hydrogen cyanide roughly four times the area of the @entity11 on @entity12 , the largest moon of @entity4			1
astronomers say the find was ' totally unexpected '			0
@entity18 's @entity17 spacecraft spotted the development of the gigantic polar cloud covering over one million square kilometres – roughly four times the area of the @entity11			1
@entity12 is unique in our solar system because of its dense nitrogen - methane atmosphere , which is very similar to @entity26 's in some ways , but very different in others			1
for example , air temperatures are around 200 degrees colder and , in contrast to the warm salt water seas of @entity26 , frigid hydrocarbon lakes populate @entity12 's surface			1
@entity12 has seasons just like @entity26 , only each season lasts over seven years instead of three months due to its ponderous orbit around the @entity38 after equinox in 2009 , @entity12 's south pole entered the perpetual darkness of polar winter			1
the new study led by @entity44 , the @entity45 and the @entity46 is published today in @entity47			0
@entity12 has seasons just like @entity26 , only each season lasts over seven years instead of three months due to its ponderous orbit around the @entity38 after equinox in 2009 , @entity12 's south pole entered the perpetual darkness of polar winter			1
soon after , instruments on @entity18 's @entity17 spacecraft observed the development of a gigantic polar cloud covering over one million square kilometres – roughly four times the area of the @entity11			1
@entity57 researcher and co-author dr @entity56 said : ' the cloud was first seen in images from @entity17 's cameras taken in 2012			0
' it started off quite small but soon grew to cover the entire south polar region			0
this was totally unexpected and set us puzzling over what the cloud could be made of			0
unfortunately , while the images showed that the cloud was very high up , at over 250km above the surface , they did not allow us to figure out what the cloud was actually made of or why it was there			0
' for the next two years @entity17 gathered more data including infrared spectra of the cloudy region			0
lead author @entity78 said : ' when we looked at the spectra , we saw two large peaks that were n't present in spectra of other places on @entity12			2
@entity4 's biggest and brightest moons are visible in this portrait			0
@entity12 ( 5,150 kilometers , or 3,200 miles across ) is @entity4 's largest moon and appears at the lower left			2
@entity88 ( 1,528 kilometers , or 949 miles across ) is the planet 's second largest moon and is seen above center			0
@entity92 ( 505 kilometers , or 314 miles across ) has the brightest surface in the solar system , reflecting nearly all of the sunlight that falls upon it			1
@entity92 is just above the rings , right of center			0
these peaks coincided exactly with the peaks you 'd expect from ice particles of hydrogen cyanide , or ' blauwzuur ' ( blue acid ) as it 's known in the @entity107 , which is highly toxic			1
this was very surprising to us , since we did not expect @entity111 ice to be able to form so high in @entity12 's atmosphere			1
' this new research suggests that @entity12 's south pole must be extremely cold to allow hydrogen cyanide to condense			1
in fact , the upper atmosphere must have cooled by over 50 degrees in less than a year to reach a blisteringly cold -150c			0
@entity78 concluded : ' this is a very rapid change given @entity12 's long annual cycle and is much colder than previously thought possible			2
it suggests that once the pole is in shadow the upper atmosphere acts as a very efficient radiator of heat , perhaps due to the high abundance of exotic hydrocarbon and nitrogen based compounds , which emit strongly in the infrared			2
this artist 's rendition shows the @entity133 probe floating in a methane / ethane lake on @entity12			2
a probe due to land on @entity4 's moon , @entity12 , could discover a world that looks ' a little bit like @entity139 or @entity140 ' , one of the mission 's scientists said			2
' @entity17 is set to continue observing @entity12 until it takes a dive into @entity4 at the end of its mission in 2017			0
it will be fascinating to see how the cloud will develop			0
