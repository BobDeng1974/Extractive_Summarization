@entity0 expects to keep his place in the @entity3 team for the @entity5 final but admits he has never been involved in a competitive penalty shoot - out			1
it adds another dimension to a familiar selection dilemma for @entity10 , who could opt for @entity11 at @entity12 , the hero of the 2012 @entity15 final when he saved three @entity17 penalties			1
the @entity3 manager could even send on @entity11 as a penalty expert if sunday ’s final against @entity21 is heading for spot - kicks , as his mentor @entity23 did with @entity25 keeper @entity24 in the @entity26			1
@entity0 is expecting to keep his place in the @entity3 goal for the @entity5 final the @entity29 keeper displaced long - serving keeper @entity11 last summer after returning from @entity32 loan 21.4 - @entity11 ’s penalty - saving percentage in the @entity34 and @entity35 — six of 28			1
@entity0 ’ record is one in eight , 12.5 % ‘ we will be prepared if it ’s going to penalties , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we all work with the goalkeeper coach and do our thing in practice			0
i ’ve only been in one shoot - out , in a friendly tournament with @entity32			0
’ @entity0 arrived in @entity45 last year after spending three years on loan at @entity32 and has become @entity3 ’s first - choice goalkeeper , starting 28 games this season to @entity11 ’s 12			1
@entity10 , however , keeps them guessing			2
@entity11 was a surprise starter against @entity52 in the @entity53 two weeks ago			2
he produced a splendid display but was back on the bench for the next game , away at @entity57 in the @entity15			0
he has not conceded a goal in the @entity53 since march when he was beaten by a @entity60 own goal			0
@entity61 smashes the crossbar in frustration after conceding an equaliser to @entity65 last saturday @entity0 , who has been in superb form this season , tips an effort over the bar in last week 's clash against @entity57 ‘ the manager makes up his mind the day before but we find out on the day of the game when he puts the team on the board , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i always said i came here to play			0
it ’s the manager ’s decision , but if you come back from loan , obviously you want to play as much as possible			0
otherwise it ’s better to keep being on loan			0
‘ i think @entity11 and i have both done well			2
we ’ve helped the team every time we could			0
’ the @entity86 was in goal when @entity3 conceded five at @entity88 on @entity89 and was left out of the next three games , before returning to play in both legs of the @entity5 semi-final against @entity93 .			1

@entity3 take on @entity21 in the @entity5 final at @entity12
@entity0 expects to keep his place in goal for @entity10 's side
@entity86 keeper has been preferred to @entity11 for much of the season
but @entity10 keeps the two goalkeepers guessing until match day
@entity0 has never taken part in a competitive penalty shootout
