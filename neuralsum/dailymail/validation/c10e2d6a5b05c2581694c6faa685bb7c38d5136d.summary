a non-league football match had to be postponed after a groundsman demolished the goalposts while mowing and rolling the pitch			1
the groundsman was dragging a heavy roller around the goal - mouth part of the pitch at the home of @entity9 when the bulky contraption firmly struck the left - hand post			1
such was the force of the collision it caused the goal frame to snap at the join of the crossbar , leaving it dismantled on the turf			0
@entity19 's home clash against @entity20 was postponed when the groundsman demolished the goalposts with a heavy roller - the home team were unable to get replacement posts in time the damage to the goalposts was so bad it meant yesterday 's @entity29 clash between @entity19 and @entity20 had to be cancelled			1
@entity30 , chairman of @entity19 , told @entity31 : ' i heard about it on the day itself and at first i did n't believe it			2
' but when i went down i saw the damage to the post and i immediately telephoned the manufacturers to see if they would be able to provide replacements			0
' but they could not deliver new ones until the middle of next week , so we had to call the game off			0
it 's just one of those things			0
' a spokesman for @entity20 said : ' we are disappointed , especially after our midweek win , but it is one of those freak things that can not be helped			2
' @entity19 's home pitch at @entity51 where the goalposts were uprooted by the groundsman @entity20 had been hoping to emulate their mid-week success , when they defeated @entity55 3 - 1			1
their impressive form is in contrast to @entity19 who have lost their previous five matches - so the week off may have been a welcome relief			2
the mid-table clash has been rescheduled for saturday , march 28 .			0
