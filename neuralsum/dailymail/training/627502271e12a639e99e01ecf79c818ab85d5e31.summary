he told the @entity26 that runt lambs are often put down by farmers who deal with them by ‘ smashing them against a wall ’			1
he said : ‘ if they [ farmers ] have a misshapen lamb , they get rid of it			0
they get rid of it			0
’ mr @entity0 said he discussed his previous statements about putting disabled children down with a farmer from his @entity43 constituency			1
he claimed the farmer made it clear he ‘ did n’t see a lot wrong with what i said , because it is something they do every day ’			0
he added : ‘ we are just animals			0
he obviously has got a point - you ca n’t have lambs running around with five legs and two heads			0
it would be put down , smashed against the wall and be dealt with			2
’ when asked if he believed there was not much difference between putting down a lamb and a child with two heads , he said : ‘ i think the cost has got to be evaluated			2
' it is not something i would like to do but there is only so much in the bucket			0
if you are talking about giving services to the community or services to the individual , the balance has got to be struck			0
’ hq : mr @entity0 , who is a councillor for @entity2 ( pictured ) , said he discussed his previous statements about putting disabled children down with a farmer from his @entity43 constituency asked if he believed it might be kinder to kill a child with two heads , he said : ‘ is that one child or two ? ‘ i would hope that , although i do n’t like the idea of it , long before it is born that this problem is [ dealt with ] and it will probably be aborted in some way			1
’ and when questioned if a child with a similar impairment should be killed after birth , he said : ‘ that would be up to the decision of whoever is there at the birth			0
’ asked whether there was a good argument for killing some disabled children with high support needs to save money , he said : ‘ yes			1
that is why i keep as far away from health in the council as i can			0
' there may be a case			0
i have n’t a clue how much they cost			0
’ mr @entity0 first caused outrage in february after telling a member of @entity108 that disabled children should be put down because they cost the authority too much			1

we have had no success as we have been told has been on sick leave and his email does n't work			0
‘ we have asked him what he means by these insulting , demeaning and disgusting comments , and whether he intends to meet local groups representing disabled people to reassure them			1
‘ @entity124 is reluctant to give him further publicity but we now join the thousands of people who have contributed to an online petition calling for his resignation as soon as possible			2
’ @entity148 , 43 , whose six - year - old daughter @entity149 has @entity150 , has been campaigning against @entity116 ’s comments and said he has ‘ brought shame on our community ’ with his ‘ extreme views ’			2
she told @entity155 : ‘ after @entity116 's initial comments and resignation , many of us hoped he would make amends and prove the sentiments behind his apology by working with disability groups			2
‘ @entity163 did not take the time to do this			0
the county was stunned when he stood again for election a few weeks later , making his apologies worthless , his arrogance all too apparent			0
‘ many families were deeply angered and hurt			0
@entity116 is bringing shame on our community , but it must be recognised that he is in a very tiny minority with his extreme views			0
‘ i have been invited to @entity173 to meet ( prime minister ’s wife ) @entity176 next week for the work i do in this field			0
i might just mention the thorn in @entity108 's side while i am there			2
’ a spokesman for @entity108 said : ‘ it ’s particularly frightening these views may be held by those who have the positions and power to make life and death decisions			1
' @entity116 is bringing shame on our community , but it must be recognised that he is in a very tiny minority with his extreme views ' @entity148 , campaigner whose daughter @entity149 has @entity150 ‘ it ’s a sad indictment of our so - called civilised society that disabled children are increasingly discussed within the context of affordability , as if they are goods on a shelf that can be picked up and discarded at will			1
’ @entity202 , project coordinator at the @entity203 in @entity204 , which works with disadvantaged and disabled youngsters said @entity116 's comments could put disabled people off visiting @entity108			1
mr @entity202 said : ‘ we are dependent on tourism and an elected councillor is saying disabled people are not welcome here			2
what kind of message does this send to people ? ‘ the disabled tourism industry in @entity108 is worth around £ 1.5 million and the council is trying to encourage more disabled people to come here			2
it is really damaging on so many levels			0
’ @entity0 is currently on sick leave from his duties as a councillor , because of medication he is taking for a long - term health condition			2
