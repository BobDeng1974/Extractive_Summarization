@entity1 @entity0 has been disqualified from next week 's @entity2 after belatedly calling a penalty on himself in qualifying			1
@entity0 , who qualified in @entity5 , @entity6 on june 2 , was playing his third shot on the 18th hole of @entity10 's @entity9 - his 27th hole of the day - when the penalty occurred			1
out : @entity0 's mistake in @entity5 was a costly one ' i 'm pretty sure i grounded my club in the bunker , ' said @entity0 , who was not disqualified until june 7			2
' i did n't see anything for sure but i felt something and i saw a small indentation			0
' it happened so fast i really do n't know 100 per cent , but deep down i believe i did			0
i could n't find peace about it			0
for five days i practised and i could n't get it off my mind			0
' it 's heart - breaking but what i was feeling in my heart did n't feel right			1
it 's the right decision and i am sticking with it			0
' @entity30 , @entity31 vice president and chairman of the championship committee , said : ' we commend @entity0 for bringing this matter to our attention			2
at this time we have no recourse but to disqualify him under the @entity38 and specifically rule 34 - 1b			0
' rule 34 - 1b effectively states that a competitor must be disqualified after the competition has closed if he has returned a score which failed to include a penalty which , before the competition closed , he knew he had incurred			2
@entity0 is replaced in the field at @entity47 by @entity1 amateur @entity48 , the second alternate from the same qualifying site			1
heart - broken : @entity0 has been forced out of a @entity47 appearance huge prize : the second major of the year is played on @entity47 's hallowed turf this week			1

@entity0 call penalty on himself five days later
the *25* - year - old says ' heart - breaking ' decision was the right one
