your baby needs to know you are there			2
' @entity7 is our miracle			1
he just refused to give up			2
' @entity7 was born at the @entity52 in @entity24 , weighing a healthy 7lb 3oz			1

' after helping me back into bed , doctors diagnosed me with a full pelvic split , which meant all the bones in my pelvis had separated from each other			2
i could n’t even walk			2
' @entity22 had left the hospital about an hour earlier to get some rest after the long night of helping me through labour			2
' he had only just got home when i rang him in tears to say that @entity7 had been taken away because he was sick			1
' @entity22 , 47 , a systems engineer , raced back to the hospital to find @entity7 was in neonatal intensive care , where he had collapsed and had stopped breathing			1

by then , i was determined to go and see him			0
' it took two hours to get me into a wheelchair lined with pillows , but despite my tears , i refused to give up			0
' i ’ll never forget how i felt looking into that incubator for the first time			0
he had more wires attached to his tiny body than i have ever seen			0
' the midwife told us to take a photo and we feared it would be the only one we ever had of our son			0
' @entity21 at eight months pregnant			0
unbeknownst to her , she had @entity117 which she had transmitted to her son over the next week , @entity21 and @entity22 could only watch while their son fought for life			0
they were warned that even if @entity7 lived , he could be brain damaged , epileptic , suffer cerebral palsy and a range of other disabilities.but he refused to give up			1
his breathing slowly improved and a few days later , doctors were able to take him off the ventilator			0
on @entity129 , @entity21 was finally able to hold her son for the first time since he had been ill and @entity7 opened his eyes for the first time			1
over the next few days , she spent up to twelve hours a day sitting in a rocking chair while @entity7 slept in her arms			1
after being fed tiny amounts of milk through a tube for the first few weeks of his life , @entity7 began to breastfeed			1
skin - to - skin contact , also known as the ‘ kangaroo care ’ technique after the way kangaroos hold their young in a pouch next to their bodies , means the mother acts as a human incubator to keep babies warm , stimulated and fed. @entity21 said : ' it was incredibly traumatic to be separated from @entity7			1
it felt fabulous to hold him in my arms			0
' the moment he opened his eyes was incredible			1
i knew that if he was waking up , he would survive			0
' in tiny , baby steps , @entity7 began to grow stronger			1
his seizures reduced and then stopped			1
his first mri came back with some small spots of brightness which appeared to indicate brain damage , but it was too early to tell			2
' @entity21 and her family handover the money raised by the sponsored walk for the hospital that saved @entity7 however , after three weeks in hospital , @entity7 , who has a hearing impairment , was well enough to go home to be with his parents and step - brother , @entity58 , ten			1
a more recent mri scan showed most of the brightness that indicated brain injury had disappeared			2
@entity21 said : ' it ’s been a continuing journey			0
we are so proud of @entity178 recently took his first steps unaided			0
it ’s another tick of the check list			0
everything he does is incredibly amazing			0

@entity21 said : ' @entity87 is very common in the @entity197 as one in four women in the @entity197 are carriers			0
it can be quickly and easily detected with a swab test between 35 - 37 weeks of pregnancy			0
' if detected it can be treated with antibiotics during labour but the @entity196 currently do n’t test for it			0
' by sharing my story , i hope more women know about @entity117 and can therefore prevent going through experiences like ours			0
' @entity213 , head of @entity214 at @entity215 , said : ' @entity7 received intensive care support on the @entity218 ’s neonatal unit after being born and was cared for by our paediatric doctors and nurses until he was well enough to go home			1
' we are grateful for the support his family has shown through their fundraising efforts for the unit			0
' one in three women carry @entity87 ( @entity117 )			0
the majority of babies born to these women will not be affected			0
however , there is a small risk that @entity117 can pass to the baby during childbirth			0
very occasionally this causes an infection in the baby which requires additional care			2
' skin - to - skin contact , or kangaroo care , is a beneficial way of helping a baby bond with its parents , especially if mum is breastfeeding			0
this contact can help the baby relax , improve temperature control and regulate the heartbeat			0
' it must be remembered that every case is different , however , and when caring for premature or sick babies treatment plans are made on an individual basis			0
