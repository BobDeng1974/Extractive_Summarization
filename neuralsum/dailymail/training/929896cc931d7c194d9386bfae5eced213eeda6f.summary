a curious smile playing on his face , the eyes and mouth are unmistakably human while the cheekbones and jutting brow say wild animal			2
@entity8 , probably our earliest ancestor and the ‘ missing link ’ between man and ape – ‘ seen ’ for the first time thanks to this incredible portrait			1
created by paleo - artist @entity16 , it is based on the remarkably well - preserved skeleton of a boy aged around 13 , found in a cave in @entity20			1
link to our past : the portrait of @entity8 is a ' forensic reconstruction ' of the teenage male human - like : skeletal hand of the female found with @entity8 ( left )			1
the skull of @entity29 ( right ) - the animal stood 4ft 4in and lived nearly two million years ago @entity30 – which means ‘ the answer ’ and is somewhat more catchy than his official name of @entity29 – stood 4ft 4in and lived nearly two million years ago			1
when he was discovered in 2008 , the greatest shock for researchers was his human - like hand			1
@entity38 , professor of evolutionary biology at @entity40 in @entity41 , said : ‘ we ’ve never seen that before			0
‘ it really is undeniable when you lay it in your hand that it ’s not a chimp			0
it looks like a hand capable of making tools			0
he shares more with humans than anything else ever discovered but is still so primitive and that ’s exciting			0
’ perfectly preserved : @entity8 's skull was discovered in @entity20 in 2008 just like us : @entity8 and his species walked upright on two legs			1
their small teeth may indicate they had found ways to process food using implements or even by cooking the first bone fragment of @entity30 was found by professor @entity68 ’s nine - year - old son near his father ’s dig site			1
the portrait was released as the skeleton – and the incomplete skeleton of a woman in her 30s found with him , possibly his mother – went on display at the @entity79 in @entity80			2
professor @entity68 said the picture was a ‘ forensic reconstruction ’ of how the boy would have looked , made possible because his skull was found intact			2
he said : ‘ that is probably him			0
normally with early human fossils , they are in such lousy condition , but here the anatomy is pretty much fixed			0
i think it ’s the most accurate that ’s ever been done			0
‘ it ’s a more human - like nose than we have seen before , he ’s just wrinkling it because he ’s smiling , chimps ca n’t smile			2
’ the only guesswork involved the pattern of hair loss and the precise skin tone			0
but even these mysteries could soon be solved as professor @entity68 ’s team believe they have found on @entity30 a sample of the protein keratin , which could lead to an analysis of his dna			0

studies in september hailed him as the best candidate for being a direct ancestor of homo erectus , the earliest modern human .			1
