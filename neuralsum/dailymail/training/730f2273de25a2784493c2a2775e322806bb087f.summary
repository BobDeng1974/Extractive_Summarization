a 22 - year - old has given birth to a healthy baby girl who grew outside her womb			1
the woman , in @entity5 , only discovered when she was 32 weeks pregnant that her baby was developing in her abdomen			1
it is thought that the fertilised egg initially implanted in her fallopian tube from where it was expelled , allowing it to implant again in her abdomen			1
a 22 - year - old has given birth to a healthy baby that grew outside her womb , in her abdomen ( file picture ) the woman was referred to a hospital in @entity20 , @entity5 , after complaining of abdominal pain and noticing that her baby was not moving very much			1
she also reported having difficulty urinating , according to a report of her case in the journal @entity26			0

an abdominal pregnancy is a form of ectopic pregnancy			0
ectopic pregnancies occur when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb - usually in the fallopian tubes , but occasionally in the abdomen			2
abdominal pregnancies usually occur as a result of a fallopian tube rupturing or expelling a fertilised egg that has first implanted in the tube			0
unlike with other ectopic pregnancies , there is a chance that a viable baby will be born following an abdominal pregnancy but there is also an increased risk of the mother dying			2
abdominal pregnancies are thought to account for about one in every 10,000 pregnancies			0
but they are dangerous as they can cause severe bleeding in the mother			0
a woman with an abdominal pregnancy will not be able to give birth naturally and the baby will have to be delivered surgically			1
if this does not happen , the baby will die and can become calcified inside the mother			0
babies born after abdominal pregnancies have a high rate of birth defects because they can be compressed as a result of there being no amniotic fluid as a protective buffer			1
they treated her for these conditions and her symptoms eased a little			0
however , a second scan two days later showed that the woman â€™s baby was actually floating in her abdominal cavity			2
the patient was found to be carrying a viable baby even though it was not in a protective amniotic sac and was not surrounded by the normal amniotic fluid			1
she was also noted to have a normal , but empty , womb and normal ovaries and fallopian tubes			0
the baby was successfully delivered during surgery			2
the little girl weighed 3lbs 7oz ( 1.7kg )			1
the mother had to be given a blood transfusion because she had severe anaemia but she and the baby were both discharged from hospital healthy			1

' i 've seen maybe four or five abdominal pregnancies over the course of 25 years , ' dr @entity143 , chief of ambulatory care , obstetrics and gynecology at @entity147 in @entity148 , told @entity152			0
