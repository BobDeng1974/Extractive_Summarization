by @entity0 published : 08:22 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 09:09 est , 15 july 2013 @entity1 has suspended its contract with @entity3 after the former double world sprint champion failed an out - of - competition dope test			1
' we are shocked by these recent allegations , and even if we presume his innocence until proven otherwise , our contract with @entity3 is currently suspended , ' an @entity1 spokesman said			1
@entity1 ' agreements with athletes give it the right to terminate the contract ' if the athlete is found guilty of the possession or use of drugs or any other prohibited substance by the relevant governing sports body having jurisdiction over the athlete			1
@entity37 sporting goods company @entity36 , which sponsors @entity31 , was not immediately available for comment			1
@entity40 ’s agent @entity39 said that his client was not implicated in the scandal , but @entity44 relay gold medallist @entity43 confirmed she had tested positive for oxilofrine at @entity33 ’s national trials last month			1
unconfirmed reports claimed that 27 - year - old @entity48 , who ran 9.87sec in a @entity49 100m on saturday night , had also fallen foul of the authorities			1
if proved , the three quickest men over 100m this year will have failed drugs tests and will miss next month ’s @entity54 in @entity55 , leaving the sport in crisis			1
star men : gay ( left ) has recorded the fastest 100m this year and @entity31 ( right ) is a former world record holder gay , 30 , the second fastest man of all time , has run the three quickest 100m times of 2013 , but tested positive for an unnamed substance at an out - of - competition test on may 16			1
the triple world champion will have his ‘ b ’ sample tested this week , but has already pulled out of the @entity69 ’s @entity54 team and friday ’s @entity71 meeting in @entity72			1
gay said : ‘ i do n’t have a sabotage story			2
i put my trust in someone and was let down			0
‘ i do n’t have anything to say to make this seem like it was a mistake or it was on @entity81 ’s ( @entity81 ) hands , someone playing games			0
i do n’t have any of those stories			0
‘ i made a mistake			0
i know exactly what went on , but i ca n’t discuss it right now			0
i hope i am able to run again , but i will take whatever punishment i get like a man			0
’ you too : after the news of @entity3 's failed test , it emerged that @entity31 ( left ) also tested positive on a dark day for athletics , it emerged @entity31 was one of five @entity33 athletes to have failed tests			1
@entity31 , @entity43 and @entity48 are coached by @entity98 at the @entity99 and the two confirmed failed tests relate to banned stimulant oxilofrine			1
two athletes who compete in field events , including a junior , are also understood to be implicated			0
@entity31 and @entity43 both insisted they had not taken the drug intentionally , with sources suggesting it was part of a supplement introduced to their training group			1
but if their ‘ b ’ samples back up the findings of the ‘ a ’ samples , they will face two - year bans and may never run again			2
devastating : gay has admitting to using a banned substance @entity118 : the news is a true blow to those involved in athletics @entity31 , 30 , said : ‘ a sample i gave this year has returned “ adverse findings ”			1
the substance oxilofrine was found , which is considered by the authorities to be a banned stimulant			1
i have never knowingly or wilfully taken any supplements or substances that break any rules			0
‘ i am not now — nor have i ever been — a cheat			0
my team has launched an investigation and we are cooperating with relevant agencies and law enforcement authorities to discover how the substance got in my system			1
‘ this result has left me devastated			0
i am reeling from this genuinely surprising result			0
my fault , however , is not cheating but not being more vigilant			0
i want to reiterate that in my career as an athlete i have never sought to enhance my performance with any substance			2
’ pulling out : gay will take no part in the @entity151 next month after the findings a member of @entity31 ’s support team was reportedly detained by @entity156 law enforcement officers last night after a property in @entity156 was raided			1
it is believed the trainer provided the sprinter with supplements that could have contributed to the positive test			2
@entity43 , 28 , also took responsibility			1
‘ as an athlete , i know i am responsible for whatever goes into my body , ’ she said			0
‘ i would not intentionally take an illegal substance			2
i am sorry for any hurt or embarrassment this positive test may have caused			2
’ this is the biggest crisis to hit athletics since the @entity173 scandal at the turn of the century , when a number of @entity69 athletes , including @entity44 champion @entity177 , were found to be taking banned substances			2
@entity179 , a friend of gay and the world 200m champion , was suspended after a positive test for a banned masking agent in june			1
another one : @entity43 ( left ) has also tested positive for a banned substance former world 110m hurdles champion @entity185 said it was an ‘ absolutely awful ’ day for track and field , while @entity190 200m champion @entity189 called it a ‘ disappointing day for our sport ’			1
@entity185 added : ‘ gay is a global star			2
it takes away faith from the public			0
the good side is it does n’t matter what level you ’re at ; if you ’re taking drugs you will get caught			0
’ @entity202 , performance director of @entity203 , said : ‘ i would start with utter disappointment			0
you think of the athletes striving day by day and it must rip the backside out of them			0
’ the banned drug oxilofrine that top @entity33 sprinters @entity31 and @entity43 have tested positive for is a stimulant used to boost the body 's ability to burn fat			1
the substance helps athletes boost their power - to - weight ratio with more lean muscle and less fat , and so increase their speed			2
it may also increase the rate at which the heart reaches its maximum performance during exercise , meaning a greater supply of oxygen can get to the muscles earlier			0
@entity229 is an agent that stimulates part of the nervous system and was previously used to treat low blood pressure			0
more recently , it has started to appear in combination with caffeine in dietary supplements marketed as weight loss products			0
however , the superiority of using oxilofrine over an exercise warm - up to achieve this appears unconvincing			0
there have been no previous findings in @entity190 but competitors in cycling , athletics , weightlifting , rugby union and american football have been banned in the last three years			2
they include the @entity69 's @entity252 , one of the world 's top amputee runners , who received a six - month ban in 2011 and @entity69 cyclist @entity256 who was banned for 18 months in 2009			1
both said they had unknowingly ingested the stimulant via an over-the - counter supplement .			0

@entity3 admits guilt after testing positive for banned substance
@entity33 @entity31 and @entity43 also fail tests
gay ran fastest 100m time this year with 9.75s
