@entity0 is set to make his @entity2 debut at @entity3 on saturday as @entity5 's side take on @entity6 in the @entity7			1
the £ 60million signing from @entity9 has joined a team who has struggled to adapt to @entity13 's 3 - 5 - 2 formation and who are yet to win a game this season			1
@entity17 will be expected to hit the ground running and lift spirits around @entity20 with a stunning debut			2
here , @entity22 takes a look at a selection of previous @entity2 big - money debutants and how they fared			0
and he lived up to this sum with the only goal in a debut win against @entity38 , showing the fans that he could become an @entity20 hero			0
he scored 121 in total before leaving in 2001			0
arrival : @entity30 announced himself to the @entity20 faithful perfectly with the winner against @entity38 clinical : @entity30 went on to score 121 goals in all for @entity2 before leaving the club in the 2001 season @entity49 £ 28.1m and @entity50 £ 19m ( 2001 ) big - money summer signing @entity49 ’s debut was overshadowed by @entity50			1
@entity2 were 2 - 1 down at home to @entity54 , but the @entity57 striker ’s brace secured a 3 - 2 win			0
double debut : @entity50 ( left ) and @entity49 ( right ) first appeared against @entity54 brace : @entity57 @entity50 scored twice as @entity2 ran out 3 - 2 winners against @entity54 in 2001 quiet : @entity49 ( left ) did not make as much of an impact as @entity50 did during @entity2 's win over @entity54 @entity64 £ 27m ( 2004 ) debuts do n’t get much better than this			1
@entity2 beat @entity67 6 - 2 in the @entity68 , and hat - trick hero @entity64 was the star man after his move from @entity71			2
the 18 - year - old scored with a tap - in , a 20 - yard strike and a free - kick			0
glory , glory : @entity64 scored a hat - trick on his @entity2 debut in @entity68 against @entity67 whip : @entity64 's hat - trick goal was a fantastic free - kick that ensured @entity2 won 3 - 0 against @entity67 power : @entity64 showed a glimpse of what @entity2 fans could expect in the following years during his debut @entity89 £ 30.75m ( 2008 ) the @entity90 had an instant impact away at fierce rivals @entity92 , pulling the ball back for @entity94 to score after just three minutes			1
but @entity89 was fairly quiet in the rest of the game , as @entity92 came back to win 2 - 1			0
mercurial : @entity90 @entity89 signed for @entity2 from @entity98 in 2008 for £ 30.75m impact : @entity89 had a quiet debut against @entity92 except this lovely flick back to @entity94 to score @entity102 £ 24m ( 2012 ) the signing from @entity104 had a debut to forget as his new side lost 1 - 0 to a spirited @entity71 team			1
@entity109 decided to start with @entity64 and @entity110 up front , so when @entity112 came on after 68 minutes he did not have much time to influence the game			0
day to forget : @entity102 ( no 20 ) came off the bench against @entity71 but @entity2 lost 1 - 0 at @entity116 disappointing : @entity112 did not score or make much of an impact off the bench as @entity2 lost to the @entity71 @entity119 £ 27.5m ( 2013 ) @entity119 was cheered on to the @entity20 pitch by fans who were relieved that @entity122 had finally spent some money			1
but it was a poor debut for @entity119 despite a 2 - 0 victory against @entity126			2
he looked clumsy and out of his depth			0
poor : @entity119 looked clumsy and out of his depth when he came on against @entity126 in 2013 warm welcome : @entity119 ( right ) received rapturous applause from fans relieved @entity122 had spent money @entity133 £ 37.1m ( 2014 ) the new no 8 got off to a winning start at @entity20 with a 2 - 0 victory against @entity137			2
@entity133 showed glimpses of the class he could offer this side , and after only six minutes he had played a part in a @entity102 goal			2
a steady start for the @entity144			0
winning start : @entity133 made his @entity2 debut in a 2 - 0 victory over @entity137 in 2014 neat : @entity133 provided a nice pass in the build - up to @entity102 's opening goal after only six minutes			1

@entity17 signed for @entity5 's side in £ 60million deal from @entity9
