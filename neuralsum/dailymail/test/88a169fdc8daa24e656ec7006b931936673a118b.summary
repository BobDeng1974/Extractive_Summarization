@entity0 has called for any migrants rescued from the @entity2 to be sent back to @entity3			2
the @entity5 leader said ' millions ' of refugees could arrive on boats in @entity8 over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now			1
mr @entity0 urged prime minister @entity9 to resist pressure at an emergency summit of @entity13 leaders in @entity14 tomorrow for @entity15 to take in large numbers of refugees brought across the @entity2 by people - smugglers			1
his comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants , including 2,500 children , could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled			2
up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of @entity34 on saturday , according to the @entity36 high commissioner for refugees			1
just 28 people are known to have survived the tragedy , described by @entity39 as ' the deadliest incident in the @entity2 we have ever recorded '			0
the @entity5 leader 's comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants , including 2,500 children , could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of @entity34 on saturday , according to the @entity36 high commissioner for refugees @entity8 has been urged to copy @entity47 's military - led ' stop the boats ' policy to avoid migrant tragedies in the @entity2			1
@entity47 pm @entity51 – who sends naval gunboats to turn back asylum seekers before they reach @entity47 – said the @entity13 should ' urgently ' follow his lead			2
his hardline policy has proved controversial but mr @entity51 said it was the only way to prevent disasters such as the loss of 900 lives when a fishing boat capsized on saturday night			2
he said : ' the only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats			0
' that 's why it is so urgent that the countries of @entity8 adopt very strong policies that will end the people - smuggling trade across the @entity2			1
' conservative mr @entity51 won power in 2013 on a ' stop the boats ' pledge , and not a single one has breached his ring of steel in 18 months			0
@entity74 involves the @entity47 navy intercepting boats filled with migrants at sea , and either turning them back or towing them back to where they came from			0
mr @entity51 has previously said he was sick of being lectured to by the @entity36 over @entity47 's obligations to refugees , saying his policy was the ' most decent , most compassionate ' solution			0
in the @entity2 , callous people smugglers have been exploiting a willingness by @entity8 nations to rescue migrants rather than send them back			1
last year , @entity89 scaled back its rescue operations because it feared they were only encouraging migrants to gamble with their lives			1
but the horrific loss of life over the past week in a spate of migrant shipwrecks has prompted calls to urgently reinstate the rescue missions			0
@entity13 leaders including @entity9 are meeting tomorrow in what charities are calling a ' life or death ' summit to solve the problem			0
the death toll from capsizing disasters stands at 1,727 so far this year - 30 times higher than the 56 fatalities by april 21 last year , according to the @entity110 ( @entity110 )			0
at its recent rate the total for this year could reach 30,000			0
the prime minister and other @entity8 leaders are under mounting pressure to come up with a plan to stem the rising number of migrants killed trying to cross the sea for a better life in @entity8			1
mr @entity0 said @entity15 bore a burden of responsibility for the flow of migrants heading out of north @entity3 because of its military interventions in countries like @entity34 and @entity128			1
he said he was happy for @entity130 ships to take part in search and rescue operations in the area , and for funds currently spent on overseas aid and @entity13 contributions to be diverted to help people in the countries involved			0
but the @entity5 leader told @entity141 's breakfast : ' the big message has to come from @entity89 , the big message has to come from @entity144			1
the @entity47 prime minister said it yesterday : unless we send a message that we are not going to unconditionally accept unlimited numbers of people , they will keep coming			0
that 's a decision that 's got to be taken by the southern @entity2 countries			0
' what is the message from @entity89 and @entity144 ? is it that anybody that comes will be accepted ? because if it is , millions of people could be coming over the next couple of years			1
' i 'm suggesting that they should be making sure that those people coming in vessels that are not seaworthy should be put into vessels which are seaworthy and taken back to where they came from			0
' there may be some cases where people genuinely need refugee status and if @entity15 has to give a helping hand and give , for example , some @entity173 refugee status ... then fine			1
' asked how many refugees he would be willing for the @entity15 to take , mr @entity0 said : ' i would suggest a few thousand , because we as a country ca n't take unlimited numbers of people			1
the prime minister is going to be under intense pressure on thursday for us to take really very big numbers and i am afraid we simply ca n't do that			0
' mr @entity9 has faced criticism for cutting funding for search and rescue operations in the area			0
the @entity189 said @entity15 military chiefs were preparing to offer one of the country 's biggest warships to help tackle the refugee crisis			1
@entity195 , a 176 - metre launchpad for helicopters and small vessels which protected @entity199 during the @entity200 , is understood to be among the options being considered by ministers			0
an @entity204 spokeswoman said it was ' looking at options but no decisions have been taken '			0
the charity @entity208 has called on @entity13 leaders to restart search and rescue operations off the coast of @entity89 within 48 hours , on the scale of the previous , and far larger , @entity89 - led @entity214 operation			1
around 1,300 people are believed to have drowned in the past two weeks while trying to reach @entity8 in make - shift boats launched by people smugglers from @entity34 – with up to 950 perishing off the @entity89 island of @entity219 over the weekend alone chief executive @entity220 said : ' @entity13 leaders hold the lives of thousands of desperate people in their hands when they meet tomorrow			1
' with every day that they prevaricate and delay restarting search and rescue operations , the risk grows that more people will die as they try to reach @entity8			1
' we can not allow 2015 to be the deadliest year in the @entity2 yet			0
we must get agreement at thursday 's meeting to scale search and rescue back up to 2014 levels			0
' even one boat that sinks is one too many , but the escalating number of people dying off @entity89 's shores brings home the urgent need to act			2
' @entity239 , chief executive of the @entity240 , said the response to events in the @entity2 was ' inadequate ' and @entity8 had to ' raise its game '			2
two alleged people smugglers , including one believed to have been the captain of the ship which was wrecked at the weekend , have been detained by @entity89 authorities , according to reports			2
it has been claimed the boat capsized after accidentally colliding with another ship which came to its aid			0
@entity253 this morning called for more to be done to help the fleeing migrants @entity15 special forces should be sent into @entity34 to lead @entity8 - wide action to tackle human traffickers , @entity253 has suggested			1
the mayor of @entity199 insisted action was required to ' choke off the problem at source ' to stop migrants being put on to unseaworthy vessels to travel across the @entity2 from north @entity3			0
he said : ' the first thing to do is to stop the people who are trafficking in human lives and i think sending over a warship - or whatever we 're going to do - is entirely right			0
' myself , i 'd like to see a real commitment to getting to grips with these people and round ... ' host @entity273 asked if this involved sending military personnel into @entity34 , mr @entity253 said : ' you need to do something about it			1
' mr @entity273 countered : ' you 're saying special forces into @entity34			2
' mr @entity253 replied : ' i 'm a long way away from the discussions about this but there are clearly some very highly organised and ruthless people who are sending people to their deaths in the @entity2			2
it seems to me that is something that should be the subject of concerted @entity8 response led by @entity15			1
' mr @entity273 interjected : ' we 've got it - the @entity293 and @entity294 into @entity34			1
' mr @entity253 said : ' i do n't see why not , i do n't see why not			2
