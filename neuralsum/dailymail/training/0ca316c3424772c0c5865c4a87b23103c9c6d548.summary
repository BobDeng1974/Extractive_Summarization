but @entity10 , who was living back at home at the time , still refused to finish the relationship and ended up moving to a hostel			1

' i said my goodbyes to her and arranged to met her that friday to go @entity168 shopping and to get maternity clothes			0

that was the last time i saw my daughter			2
' in june this year , @entity11 was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 20 years and @entity6 attended everyday of the trial and witnessed every traumatic testimony			1
' i did it for my daughter			2
no matter how harrowing , i needed to know all that – i did n't want my mind to make it up			0
at some point i 'm going to do the walk to where they murdered her – but not just yet			2
' she added how disappointed she was with the sentence			0

then he had three years knocked off for being " nice " , ' she said ironically			0
' he 's got a life now – he has three meals a day			2
i 've lost my daughter , i 've lost my grandchild , i 've lost a big part of my future and our families future			2
