some things are just better together - working hand in hand to bring the best out of each other			1
take one away , and often what was once a magical combination becomes empty , meaningless and lacks that vital ingredient			2
alive and kicking again : @entity5 is set to explode on to consoles on september 14 all except one ... @entity5			1
a fighting game of such pedigree that not even breaking it from its arcade shackles , and swapping ' insert coin ' for ' press start ' could drag it into mediocrity			1
it kept its identity and it blossomed , punching and kicking its way into thousands of homes			0
this was a tactician ’s beat - em - up			1
a game not bought for its gruesome fatalities or buckets of blood			1
but one that rewarded you to spectacular fist fights for the long hours spent honing your moves , learning combinations and studying your challenger ’s weak points			0
the inevitable sequels , spin - offs and ( lame ) movies soon spawned			1
@entity5 had managed to do what many had failed to achieve			0
it had transcended the world of video games and had become a brand			0
but , like with any good thing , the dream had to end , and slowly but surely @entity5 ’s impact on consoles blunted – swamped by mediocre copycats that cared more about the size of their characters ’ ‘ assets ’ than gameplay			1
indeed , it looked like gamers had been treated to the last taste of true , arcade - style fighting			1
until now ... three 's a crowd : you 'll be able to perform tag throws because like a roundhouse kick to the head , @entity69 is exploding on to consoles			0
its mission … to restore faith in the struggling genre			0
it ’s off to a good start , offering the largest roster yet in the series with 50 new and returning characters			1
along with returning modes such as @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , there ’s a new mode called @entity89 for @entity5 ' noobs '			0
here , you take control of a @entity93 who is taught a load of moves through various stages			0
there ’s even a ( sort of ) story there to keep you playing and to stop it feeling like a boring tutorial			0
but the real reason why you ’d buy @entity5 is for the multiplayer			0
this lets you challenge your friends in a 2 - on - 2 tag - team battle , 1 - on - 1 or 1 - on - 2			1
players are able to switch their fighters at any time , which lets the resting character gradually recover some life they might have lost			0
you can do special techniques such as tag throws , which can be countered if your timing is good enough			0
and there are also loads of different items that can alter gameplay – ranging from weapons such as firearms and hammer hats , to superficial @entity124			0
you can customise your character with some accessories , too			0
graphically , the game ’s looking sharp			1
the frame - rate never slows down , colours are vibrant and character models are full of detail			1
level design is inspired , ranging from the hilarious to the down - right weird			2
one stage , for example , sees you fight in front of rapper @entity137 , while he sits on a glitzy throne surrounded by women – his music ( written specifically for the game ) playing in the background			1
bear - knuckle fighting : the weird world of @entity5 sees you fight massive animals another sees you surrounded by pandas and bears wearing tutus , dancing around like ballerinas while some bizarre light show flashes away			1
but that ’s the aim of this latest @entity5 game – it pulls no punches on creativity			2
it ’s striving to reinvent itself , to be remembered , and re-establish itself as the fighting phenomenon it once was			2
however , in a world where more and more gamers demand depth , story and multi-layered offerings , it ’ll be interesting to see whether the simple beat - em - up genre can hold its own , or if its linear nature is now out - of - date with current gaming expectations			2
come september , we ’ll find out if @entity69 has done enough to get the beat - em - genre alive and kicking again			2
