by @entity0 published : 13:47 est , 28 february 2014 updated : 01:01 est , 1 march 2014 when @entity4 was knocked unconscious by a falling ceiling fan at 22 , her memory was completely erased and she woke up with the mental age of a four - year - old			1
now , 26 years on , the @entity9 - based mother - of - three has discussed the devastating effect amnesia has had on her life and her family 's			1
in an interview with @entity15 to coincide with publication of her memoir , i forgot to remember , the 48 - year - old revealed that she was a completely different person after her freak accident - something which her husband , @entity22 , understandably struggled to cope with			1
coming to terms with memory loss : @entity4 , pictured here with her husband @entity22 , has opened up about the devastating effect amnesia has had on her life and her family 's ' for 20 years he had affairs and would be away traveling a lot			1
' he was n't getting what he needed at home			2
it was years before i was able to have sex again , ' mrs @entity34 said , adding that she does n't blame mr @entity38 for his actions			1
while she was a rebellious free spirit before her head injury , she was ' cold and logical ' afterwards			2
the concept of love and marriage was difficult to comprehend and , before she wrapped her head around that , she still had to re-learn how to read , write and even tie her shoelaces			2
' i was n't the person @entity22 married , ' mrs @entity34 mused			1
indeed , in her new memoir she highlights just how different she was - using ' she ' to refer to her former - self			1
starting from scratch : mrs @entity34 , pictured here at a family gathering , said that it took years to familiarize herself with places and faces and still to this day she has no memories from her youth photographic record : still to this day she can not remember meeting mr @entity38 at college , their first kiss or even being pregnant with their two sons @entity61 and @entity64 , now aged 27 and 26 ' she never knew me , and i know nothing of her except what people have told me			1
' she rebelled ; i conform			1
she broke rules ; i follow them			2
she drank and smoked pot ; i do n’t even know the taste of beer or wine , and the smell of smoke makes me physically ill. ' i like vegetables ; she hated them			2
she loved to swim ; i am absolutely terrified of the water			1
' ' i never fell in love with @entity22			2
in my eyes we never dated			2
i was just assigned to a family ' the music enthusiast says she has absolutely no recollection of her life prior to being knocked out on may 22 , 1988			1
it took her years to familiarize herself with places and faces			1
still to this day she can not remember meeting mr @entity38 at college , their first kiss or even being pregnant with their two sons @entity61 and @entity64 , now aged 27 and 26			1
it was around four years after her accident that mrs @entity34 was able to start forming memories again			1
one of the earliest things she remembers is seeing @entity61 learning to ride a two wheel bike in the driveway at home for the first time			2
' because my scans did n't show anything up doctors thought i was faking it or looking for attention			2
it was very frustrating , ' mrs @entity34 said , recalling what happened after her accident back to school : mrs @entity34 is currently studying for bachelor 's degree in music at @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity9 - she finishes her final semester this may however , one thing that set her back was falling pregnant in 1993			1
despite having the body of a 27 - year - old mrs @entity34 said she still felt like a child			1
' i was totally freaked out , i thought it was disgusting , gross ! ' she exclaimed			2
she said as she watched her daughter , @entity120 , grow she felt more like a big sister than a mother as the two would learn how to do things together - from reading books to mathematical equations			1
' i felt like i grew up with all of my children			2
like we 're siblings , it 's difficult to explain , ' mrs @entity34 laughed			1
' because my scans did n't show anything up doctors thought i was faking it or looking for attention			0
but @entity22 had to live with me			0
he knew it was serious ' in 2007 , almost two decades after her life - changing head injury , mrs @entity34 said her marriage finally reached breaking point			1
part of the reason for this was her inability to keep on top of things at home while determinedly pursuing a music degree at @entity148 ’s @entity147			0
' @entity149 took my attention away from things at home , ' she recalled			0
' when i went back to school i was scared to death and a complete mess			0
i forgot to make dinner , do the grocery shopping or clean			0
' @entity22 felt very ignored during that time and he was ready to leave and had one foot out the door			0
i was just in " going to school mode "			0
' seeing what was going on , mrs @entity34 's teenage children encouraged her to seek help from a marriage counselor			1
i forgot to remember by @entity4 is out now it was during a therapy session that mr @entity38 confessed his infidelities			1
despite the revelation the couple decided to work things through			0
commenting about how things are now between them , mrs @entity34 said : ' i never fell in love with @entity22			0
in my eyes we never dated			0
i was just assigned to a family			0
' we 've had such a rough marriage and it 's just different			1
we have our own ways of doing things			0
' this week mrs @entity34 went on a trip for the first time without a family member or friend by her side			0
she said that she had more than 50 post-it notes dotted around her hotel room to remind her where she was and what needed doing			0
asked what her hope is for the future she replied : ‘ people with @entity189 are often misunderstood and more research is needed into the topic			0
' i 'd love my story to draw more attention to the topic and to help other families who are going through the same			0
' because my scans did n't show anything up doctors thought i was faking it or looking for attention			0
it was very frustrating and they told me i should go and see a shrink			0
' but @entity22 had to live with me			0
he knew it was serious			0
' mrs @entity34 is currently studying for bachelor ’s degree in music at the prestigious @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity9			0
she finishes her final semester this may			0
she concludes : ' i 'm not ever going to be the person that i was			1
i feel like i 'm 20			0
' i have good days and bad days but i 'm stronger than ever now			0
' i forgot to remember by @entity4 , published by @entity208 , is out now on @entity209 memory loss is one of the most common side effects of traumatic brain injury ( @entity189 )			1
even in mild cases , it is still very common			0
the more severe the memory loss after a @entity189 , the more significant the brain damage is likely to be			1
patients are often unable to recall what happened just before , during and after they sustained a head injury			0
this temporary memory loss is caused by the brain swelling as a result of the damage it sustained			2
it presses against the skull and even parts of it that were uninjured by the impact are still unable to function correctly			0
the patient 's memory typically returns as the swelling goes down over a period of weeks or even months			1
however , damage to the nerves and axons ( connection between nerves ) of the brain may also result in memory loss			2
the brain can not heal itself like a limb so a victim 's memory will be permanently impaired unless the brain learns how to perform it differently over a period of time by establishing new nerve connections			1
this can not be predicted but doctors now believe victims may continue to regain brain function many years after suffering a tbi .			2

@entity4 's memory was erased 26 years *ago* when she was knocked unconscious by a *kitchen* ceiling fan
the mother - of - three uses ' she ' to refer to her former - self because she is such a different person today
' she rebelled ; i conform . she loved to swim ; i am absolutely terrified of the water '
