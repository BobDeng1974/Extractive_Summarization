when the economy is bouncing along the bottom anyway , a bout of bad weather can easily tip it into negative territory , ’ he added			1
snowfall over much of the country is likely to hurt the economy because wintry weather deters shoppers from heading to the @entity37 and also affects internet shopping because deliveries can be delayed , @entity19 said			1
but the worst impact is on construction and on supply chains , where companies find it hard to make up for lost ground			2

new governor @entity89 suggested in a recent speech he might favour a target that included growth as well as inflation			0
‘ the inflation target is well past its sell by date , which it reached at the turn of the millennium , ’ @entity19 said , adding that the @entity2 is doomed to at least two years more of sluggish growth if the @entity71 and the chancellor do not take a different approach			1
