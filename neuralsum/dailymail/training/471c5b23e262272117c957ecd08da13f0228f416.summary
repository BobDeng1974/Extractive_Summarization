she re-injured her back cutting the grass in the summer of 2012 and went in for a steroid injection at @entity13			1
she had previous shots that usually brought relief			0
dealing with the aftermath : daughter @entity129 says the worst part is not the money , but that her mother 's physical abilities , self - confidence and independence were taken from her cost of treatment : @entity3 's medications alone cost between $ 400 and $ 600 a day at one point , and her treatment is ongoing , so the bills continue to accumulate , according to her daughter , @entity129 , pictured left with lawyer a fight for her life : meningitis victim @entity3 of @entity170 , @entity75 , says her savings are gone after the hospital billed her for curing the fungal infection they gave her after this injection , however , she started having fevers and aches			1

fungal meningitis is extremely rare and occurs when a fungus , in this case a black mold , infects the lining of the spinal cord and brain			1
most sickened in the 2012 outbreak were infected by a fungus that had never been observed as a cause of meningitis , making it difficult for doctors to know how long to prescribe a potent anti-fungal that can damage the liver and kidneys and have other harsh side effects			1
doctors have warned many patients , including @entity263 , to be aware of any relapse symptoms .			0
