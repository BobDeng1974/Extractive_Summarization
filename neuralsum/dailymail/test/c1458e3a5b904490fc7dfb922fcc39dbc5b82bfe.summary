@entity1 coach @entity0 is expecting a ' boring ' match against @entity3 in the @entity4 on tuesday , believing that both sides will adopt a cautious approach			1
' our target is to get through this round and reach the semi-finals , and if we qualify 1 - 0 or 1 - 1 ( on aggregate ) , that 's all the same to me , ' said @entity0 , whose side are at home in the quarter - final first leg on tuesday			1
' it could be a boring game , the important thing is not to concede a goal at home			2
' @entity1 manager @entity0 strolls in to his pre-match press conference on monday the @entity1 squad look relaxed as they are put through their paces in sunny @entity24 @entity0 warned that @entity3 , who have conceded only four goals in eight games on their way to the quarter - finals , would be a completely different proposition to @entity30 , who @entity1 beat 5 - 1 on aggregate in the last 16			1
' the tie against @entity3 is much more complicated than the one against @entity30 , ' he said			2
' they are two very different teams , the @entity36 side concede few goals and it 's always more complicated to play against a team that does n't go forward very often			0
veteran midfielder @entity39 has returned to training after a calf injury @entity42 looks focused as he engages in a training drill on monday @entity44 ( left ) and @entity45 will both be hoping to start in the @entity4 quarter - final ' it 's tempting to go forward ourselves and there is the risk of leaving spaces for them			1
we need patience , humility and intelligence , and to realise that we are not going to settle qualification in @entity24			0
' i think they ( @entity3 ) have richly deserved to get to the quarter finals , ' added @entity0			1
' they conceded one goal in six games during the group stage , eliminating @entity64 and @entity65			0
in @entity67 , they have the best defence with 22 goals conceded ( in 32 games )			0
these figures do not come by chance			0
' experienced defender @entity73 smiles as he talks to the media on monday afternoon @entity0 said that playmaker @entity39 had been included in the squad after recovering from a calf muscle injury , and he now had to decide whether the 35 - year - old could be plunged into the tie after a seven - week lay - off			2
' @entity39 has n't played for more than 40 days , i 'll decide after the last training session , ' he said .			0
