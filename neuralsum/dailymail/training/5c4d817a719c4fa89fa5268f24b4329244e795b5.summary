the schoolboy went to his gp in january with pain in his leg , and was referred to @entity20 where he was warned by doctors he could lose the limb			0
he was sent to the @entity23 in @entity24 and was diagnosed with osteosarcoma , a form of bone cancer , after numerous tests			1
his mother @entity29 , 51 , said : ' @entity3 's reaction was , ' " t can take my leg but it 's not having my life "			1
' we just went to bits			0
' the brave teenager had intensive chemotherapy before undergoing the operation where his tibia was removed and taken by the surgeon to @entity41 in @entity24 where it was irradiated to tackle the cancer and then re-implanted			0
the bone had to be taken to @entity45 because the paediatric ward @entity3 was being operated in did not have the right equipment			1
his father @entity48 , 42 , said : ' we were relieved they were going to save his leg because the feedback at first was that he was going to lose it			0
' it 's better to have your own bone in there with a metal pin , and it will knit back together			2
' after ten days in hospital , @entity3 returned home and restarted chemotherapy at @entity20			2
x-ray : @entity3 's leg is now held together by a metal pin after his shin bone was removed and replaced source : @entity68 he is due to finish at @entity70 but will carry on being treated with new bone cancer drug mifamurtide , for which doctors had to get specialist funding			1

he 's been as brave as anything			0
' dr @entity88 , @entity3 's consultant at @entity20 , said : ' in @entity3 's case , surgeons used his own bone which was removed , treated with radiotherapy and replaced , which is a technique which has been used for the last couple of years to try to avoid amputation			1
' surgeons were unsure whether @entity3 's unusual operation had worked until they removed the cast from his left leg two weeks ago following the operation on july 6 this year			1
@entity48 said : ' @entity3 had to have a full cast from his groin downwards , completely covering his left leg and it was only when they took it off they said the operation had been a success			2
' the surgeon was so dedicated , he took the bone out then took it himself to the other hospital to make sure everything was fine			0
' the bone was out of his body for about three or four hours			0
' he added : ' they had quite a few options before the surgery - they could have amputated , which obviously nobody wanted - or they could have put a titanium piece in the leg to replace the bone , but there is a greater chance of infection then			2
' @entity3 has been incredibly brave throughout this , we 're really proud of him			2
he 's still having chemotherapy , which we hope will finish on @entity131			0

' it can take my leg but it 's not having my life ' : 15 - year - old @entity3 *refused* to succumb to bone cancer
