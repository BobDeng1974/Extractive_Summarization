by @entity0 published : 13:37 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 02:35 est , 20 september 2013 case : the jury at @entity4 's inquest will hear evidence from a witness who claims she saw police plant a gun at the scene of his death a judge took the highly unusual step of leading his court in a moment ’s silence to commemorate @entity4 , the alleged gangster whose death sparked the 2011 riots which scarred @entity20			1
judge @entity23 , sitting at @entity22 ’s inquest , asked everyone inside the courtroom to fall silent and to acknowledge the ‘ regrettable loss of a young life ’			1
later the inquest heard @entity22 was a member of one of @entity20 ’s most notorious gangs and was shot by a police marksman who believed the suspect was about to fire a revolver in a crowded street			1
judge @entity23 , sitting as a coroner at the @entity36 , led the 20 - second silence by lowering his head and clasping his hands together			1
addressing the jury , he said : ‘ it is right that you should know that present in court today are a number of @entity4 ’s family and friends and to acknowledge the grief of those family and friends and to respect that loss we will together just have some moments of silence as we sit here to recognise the seriousness of the hearing for which we are about to undertake			0
’ the request for a moment ’s silence was understood to have been made by @entity22 ’s family and supporters			1
inquests , by their nature , involve the passing of a loved one , but are not generally used to commemorate someone ’s death			0
the decision to hold a period of silence at the start of an inquest is virtually unprecedented			1
key evidence : a photograph of the gun , shown to the jury at the @entity79 as part of the two - month inquest case : photograph shows a gun in a sock found 10 - 20ft away from @entity4 , 29 , when he was shot dead by police in @entity88 the inquest heard yesterday how @entity22 was shot twice by a police marksman after the officer saw him raise a gun wrapped in a sock towards him			1
one bullet hit the 29 - year - old in his right bicep and the other hit him in the chest , which killed him ‘ in 10 heartbeats ’ , it was said			1
judge @entity23 asked everyone inside the courtroom to fall silent and to acknowledge the ' regrettable loss of a young life ' moments before he was killed , the taxi in which he was travelling was stopped by armed police during the evening rush - hour in @entity88 , north @entity108 , on august 4 , 2011			1
the father - of - four , who had taken the party drug @entity111 , then ran out of the @entity113 minicab holding the gun , the court was told			0
the firearms officer , known only by his codename of @entity117 , opened fire in ‘ self - defence ’ because he thought @entity22 posed a ‘ lethal threat ’			2
when officers looked for the gun they thought he was holding they found it up to 20 feet away on the other side of a wall from where he was killed , the inquest heard			0
counsel for the inquest @entity131 , @entity132 , said armed officers tried to shock @entity22 ‘ into submission ’ by performing a ‘ hard stop ’ on the taxi by blocking it with three unmarked police cars			1
addressing the jury , he said : ‘ regrettably you will hear it did n’t work , in the sense that mr @entity22 was n’t shocked into submission , ’ he said			0
‘ he got out of the minicab and he ran			0
you will also hear , of course , from @entity117 that he was running with a gun in his hand and he started to bring that gun up into the aim ( position )			0
evidence : photograph shows the bullet - holed jacket worn by @entity4 on the night he was shot @entity156 captured the taxi in which the father - of - four was travelling when it was stopped by armed police			2
the jury visited the scene yesterday ‘ that police officer will tell you that the reason he fired was because he saw what he believed to be a gun wrapped in a sock in mr @entity22 ’s hand and that he was presenting it in a way that was threatening and that he fired in self - defence			2
‘ one of the shots hit mr @entity22 on the inside of his right bicep , but did n’t do very much damage			2
‘ the second went through his chest and came out his back going through his aorta , the main artery which pumps blood into the heart , and was fatal			0
’ less than half an hour before the shooting @entity22 had allegedly picked up a gun from @entity183 , who has since been jailed for supplying it to him			0
image shows a dummy in similar jacket to the one worn by @entity4 on the night he was shot and the entry points of the bullets a photograph of the taxi which @entity4 was travelling in on the night he was shot in @entity88			2
the jury must decide if the gun was taken by police and planted aftermath : @entity156 caught this image of paramedics treating @entity4 after he was shot detectives had set up a covert surveillance operation on @entity22 and five other suspects because they believed they were members of the notorious @entity204 gang			2
the criminal network has been linked to dozens of murders since its members started drugs trafficking on the notorious @entity209 in @entity88 from the mid- 1980s			0
mr @entity131 said @entity210 had set up @entity211 to thwart the illegal activities of the @entity214 gang			0
grief : @entity216 , mother of @entity4 ( centre ) outside the the @entity79 family and friends attend the inquest into the death of @entity4 who was shot dead by police in @entity88 ‘ they were concentrating on a gang based in @entity88 called for short @entity214 and they believed that mr @entity22 was a gang member and was going to pick up a gun from a man called @entity229 or @entity183 , ’ he said			1
he also told the jury that @entity22 and @entity183 appeared to speak on the phone several times before the gun was allegedly handed over			0
mr @entity131 told the jury that they will need to decide if @entity22 was holding gun when he was shot , if it was necessary for the marksman to fire twice and if the police operation was planned and implemented in a way that minimised lethal force			1
the inquest , which is expected to last two months , continues			2
