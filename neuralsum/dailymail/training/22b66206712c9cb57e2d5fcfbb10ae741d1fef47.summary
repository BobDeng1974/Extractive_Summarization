psychiatric disorders could be treated with a tiny chip implanted in the skull after a new research programme was announced by a defense agency			1
the @entity5 is funding the research costing $ 26 million with the aim of finding more effective treatments for current and ex-servicemen , who suffer from conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder			1
the project , which will be carried out by @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , is the first research project launched in support of president @entity18 ’s @entity17 and will be called @entity19 for emerging therapies ( @entity20 )			0
the @entity5 hopes to develop devices to stimulate the brain , which will eliminate the symptoms of anxiety disorders it is hoped the research will show the detrimental signaling patterns that are evident in major depression , anxiety disorders and addiction			1
they then hope to develop devices to stimulate the brain and strengthen alternative circuits , which means the symptoms of these conditions can be eliminated			2
dr @entity36 , team leader of the new project explained : ' human brain recording can now reveal aspects of mental illness that have been inaccessible to scientists and doctors			0
once the signalling patterns of conditions such as depression or post traumatic stress disorder are identified , the implantable devices will show the neural circuits , which are common with the disorders			1
the devices will then pick up when this neural activity is occuring in the brain and determine if electrical stimulation should be delivered to correct the abnormal brain pattern			1
source : @entity14 ' by analyzing patterns of interaction among brain regions known to be involved in mental illness we can get a more detailed look than ever before at what might be malfunctioning , and we can then develop technology to correct it			2
' a team at the @entity65 will also work with @entity66 to develop the microchips that could be implanted under a person 's skull			2
electrodes could then deliver tailor made therapy to the patient and record neurological data			0
anxiety disorders , which include post-traumatic stress disorder , cost the @entity76 $ 42billion a year , nearly one - third of the country ’s total mental health care costs , according to the @entity79			1
@entity5 hopes to build on the implants already used to treat parkinson 's disease , including the @entity82 , pictured researchers say existing treatments such as therapy and some medications can help the conditions but they can take many weeks to have an effect			2
@entity89 , an assistant professor of psychiatry at @entity14 added : ' there are millions of people for whom these disorders are not well treated			0
' these patients are not able to keep their jobs or to work at all , because they 're constantly struggling with symptoms of their illnesses and the pain and suffering they cause			0
' this project offers hope because it ’s a totally new way of seeing how the parts of the brain interact in mental illness			0
' it ’s as if we ’ve been looking at still images of actors but will now be able to see the performance of a play			0
' the @entity76 @entity5 last month announced that it is working on restoring memories using brain implants that could reverse the loss in wounded soldiers , and benefit @entity114 's and dementia patients			0
@entity5 added that they hope to build on neuroengineering advances such as implants already used to treat @entity81 , built by @entity119 firm @entity82 .			1

@entity5 is funding the research
hope to establish the signalling patterns of anxiety disorders
they will then use this to develop implantable microchips
the tiny chips in the skull will deliver electrical stimulation when there is abnormal brain activity
could be used to treat servicemen suffering from ptsd or depression
