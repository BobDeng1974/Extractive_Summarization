by @entity1 reporter published : 07:45 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 18:40 est , 19 july 2013 teenagers in one of @entity5 ’s poorest boroughs are hiring expensive supercars to help celebrate the end of their school days			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are being rented by 16 - year - olds in @entity13 , @entity14 , for their national record of achievement ( @entity17 ) ceremony , a prom - like event that marks the end of compulsory schooling			1
many of the cars would cost more to buy than homes in the area			1
the vehicles can cost up to £ 300,000 to buy , yet one bedroom flats in some parts of the borough are worth as little as £ 70,000			1
the group wanted to head to their national record of achievement ( @entity17 ) ceremony in style , and found this spectacular to attend their prom - like celebration			2
' it 's showing off , basically			0
playing music , going from area to area to area , ' said @entity76 , a pupil at @entity51 , who attended the ceremony this year and split a £ 400 fee with a friend to rent an @entity81 for four days			1
' showing off your car , just everyone looking at you			0
it 's like your spotlight , ' @entity76 said			0
' when every @entity17 comes you just feel excited for the kids , ' said @entity88 who went through the rite of passage last year and works part - time at his brother 's car - hire business , which rents out vehicles for the ceremonies			0
' certain people obviously do n't want to spend the money , you can understand that , their parents might be not working			0
but certain kids , obviously , they 're crazy , they 'll save up from young and they just want to hire it , ' @entity48 said			0
tough upbringing : @entity102 , 16 , poses in @entity13 , in front of homes that are worth less than some of the cars on show local residents look at a @entity43 as they stand on a balcony at a social housing estate - an area where at least one in ten are without work admiring : a man photographs this parked supercar while chatting on another mobile phone , with a makeshift washing line to his left sharing a joke : @entity119 , 16 , talks to fellow pupil @entity120 , 16 , next to his hired @entity43 , on the @entity121 during @entity123 graduation day mates : schoolboys ( @entity126 ) @entity127 , 16 , @entity37 , 16 and @entity128 , 16 , stand by a @entity39 , which they hired a police officer holds his bike with ome and and gesticulates with the other next to a classic black @entity134 larking about : @entity136 , 16 , poses in front of a @entity138 hired by friends for a parade of ' supercars ' to celebrate leaving school @entity13 is home to the largest @entity145 community in @entity5 , and the majority of pupils taking part are of @entity145 origin			1
@entity150 , a senior youth worker with the @entity152 youth and community organisation , said the prom - like celebrations probably caught on 14 or 15 years ago , with pupils hiring limousines , but have gotten more lavish - and expensive - since			2
' it was quite small at that time , but obviously now it 's probably the biggest date on their diaries , including @entity162 ( the @entity163 holiday ) and everything else			0
relaxed : school friends jannat and @entity168 chat with their feet up in a @entity170 limousine they hired this year having fun : a student shows off his haircut in the rain as he admires this white @entity55 in @entity13 getting some air : @entity176 , 16 , leans out of a @entity170 limo and yells to friends as they leave a car park for school bragging rights : a student from @entity123 gestures and screams as he drives past boys on bikes during the parade envious ? onlookers gaze at a @entity170 as it passes through the @entity188 cashing up : boys from @entity123 exchange money to pay for the hire of a ' supercar ' , as they split the costs so they can afford one on their graduation day the students , who at 16 are too young to drive , were chauffeured through the neighbourhood either by drivers connected with car hire companies or by friends or relatives			1
clad in evening wear , they pose for pictures before attending the @entity17 ceremony at school , during which awards and certificates are distributed , and then head out for the night			2
many of those in the more expensive rides switch later to ' after - cars ' - saloons or larger vehicles - which they can travel in together , often getting involved in road races			1
videos of the day , set to pounding hip - hop and @entity218 soundtracks , are posted on @entity219			2
good crowd : @entity123 students pose for a group photograph between two super expensive cars on a say they 'll remember forever springing into action : @entity226 , 16 , leaps out of a @entity227 to have fun with his friends at the prom fun times : @entity232 sits in the plush car with his friends , although of course none of them are old enough to drive high - rollers : students and onlookers watch as a @entity138 sweeps into school , with many taking photos om their phones for some teens , the substantial sums are hard to get together			1
@entity226 , a student at @entity244 , said that when he first approached his mother with the price of booking a car , it was too much to take from the family budget			0
in the end , he was only able to go to the ceremony in a showy ride thanks to a friend 's mother , who borrowed a @entity255 for free with the help of a company connection			0
getting the vehicle meant a lot to him : ' just the feeling that you 're actually taking part in the ceremony by having a car , it 's a good feeling , ' he said .			0

a new craze is sweeping through east @entity14 , where teenagers rent expensive cars to celebrate leaving school
youngsters paying at least £ 100 per day for the cars , in area where upwards of one in 10 are out of work
