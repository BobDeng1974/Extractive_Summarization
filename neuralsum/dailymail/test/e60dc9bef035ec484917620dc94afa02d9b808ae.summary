@entity1 trainer @entity0 has favourably compared his 2,000 @entity2 to last year 's fifth - placed runner @entity4 , who landed three @entity7 races in 2014			1
@entity8 was one of 34 colts which remain in the first classic of the season run on saturday , may 2			1
@entity8 won just one of his four starts last season but he has run twice this term , posting a career best on his most recent start when landing the @entity20 by a head			1
@entity1 trainer @entity0 likens his 2,000 @entity2 to charm spirit both the runner - up that day , @entity24 , and the fifth home , @entity26 , could reoppose in the @entity27 to make it a three - pronged @entity1 assault on the @entity27			2
@entity0 said : ‘ @entity8 will run in the @entity27			1
he has done very well since his last race , his work has been good , and i think that he has improved a bit			0
‘ he is on the same sort of level as @entity4 was at this time last year			2
they are similar horses in that they tend to be a bit keen and if @entity8 settles better than @entity4 did last year i think that he has a good chance			1
@entity0 says @entity8 is ' on the same sort of level ' as @entity4 was at this time last year ‘ that is why i have given him two runs already this season , to get the freshness out of him before the @entity27			1
' i was very happy with his @entity20 victory			0
he settled then quickened well and it was to his credit that he won despite being held up at the back of the field when the pace was slow			0
' the undulations at @entity54 wo n’t be a problem for him and although seven furlongs is a good trip for him at the moment i think that he will stay a mile as long as he relaxes			2
’ the @entity59 - trained pair of @entity60 and @entity61 head the @entity27 entries			2
also still in contention are the three winners of last week ’s classic trials – @entity66 ( @entity67 ) , @entity68 ( @entity69 ) and @entity70 ( @entity71 )			0
@entity60 and @entity61 , both trained by @entity59 , lead the entries for the @entity27 @entity76 ’s impressive @entity75 winner @entity74 could still be supplemented to the @entity27			0
connections would have to pay £ 30,000 on monday to add him to the line - up			0
one colt who is looking likely to be supplemented to the @entity27 field is @entity83 , who has pleased @entity85 since winning a @entity20 at @entity86			0
a statement on @entity89 ’s website quoted @entity85 as saying : ‘ @entity90 has come out of his trial very well and has come on for the run			0
at this stage , a supplementary entry in the @entity27 at @entity54 is under serious consideration and we are 90 % certain to take that route , subject to the horse continuing to please me			1

@entity8 is one of 34 colts still in the first classic of the season
the @entity27 will be run at @entity54 on saturday , may 2
@entity8 is a similar horse to 2014 's fifth runner @entity4
the horse landed the @entity110 by a head last start
