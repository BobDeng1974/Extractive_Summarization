by @entity0 controversial : a designer crop has been genetically engineered to produce cod liver oil a controversial designer crop genetically engineered to produce fish oils has received approval to be grown in our fields			1
@entity9 ’s environment department , @entity8 , announced it had rubber stamped the first @entity12 field test in three years			1
scientists will start planting the crop next month in a heavily guarded field in @entity16 , in the first stage of a trial that will last four years			2
@entity19 - the body behind the trial - claim the crop , @entity22 , will create a synthetic form of cod liver oil that could be sold on shop shelves by 2020			1
the scientists developed the engineered plant by ‘ cutting and pasting ’ genes from algae into a tall , spindly flax plant similar to oil seed rape			1
they claim the crop produces the same amount of healthy omega - 3 fatty acids as fish oils			2
opponents of ‘ frankenstein foods ’ are worried about hidden ecological and health risks of the crop , which have not yet been tested			2
they also view the approval as further evidence of the environment secretary ’s unbridled enthusiasm for gm technology			0
mr @entity9 has warned that @entity46 risks becoming the ‘ museum of world farming ’ if it does not embrace @entity12 - and dismissed opponents of the science as ‘ wicked ’			1
professor @entity51 , lead scientist at the taxpayer - funded @entity19 research project , claims the technology will take pressure off dwindling fish stocks			0
' frankenfish ' : the process means you no longer need actual fish , like the mackerel pictured , to produce fish oil speaking to the @entity62 in january he said : ‘ we are interested in producing fish oils in plants because fish oils , and the long - chained @entity68 fatty acids , are known to be very important for human health and nutrition			1
‘ global fish stocks are in decline so there is a problem of the availability of fish for these fatty acids			0
’ laboratory experiments have shown that by inserting up to seven genes from algae into @entity80 , the plant can produce two key omega - 3 fatty acids that are normally obtained from oily fish , eicosapentaenoic acid ( @entity84 ) anddocosahexaenoic acid ( @entity86 )			1
the acids are linked to health benefits for the heart , brain and nervous system and are thought to provide greater protection against diseases such as @entity94 ’s			0
@entity19 said its initial hopes for the new crop is as a feed in fish farms , which consume 80 per cent of fish oil supplies			2
but professor @entity51 said that by the end of the decade , the @entity12 - produced oil could be sold for human consumption as an omega - 3 supplement or as an addition to food products such as margarine			1
he added : ‘ by the end of this decade , there ’s a possibility that people will be able to obtain a @entity12 plant - based source of fish oils			1
’ supporter : secretary of environment , food and rural affairs , @entity118 , approved the test but he admitted none of the oil had so far been consumed by humans and it would need to pass rigorous health checks before it could enter the food chain			2
@entity127 director @entity126 said : ‘ we know that the environment secretary @entity9 strongly favours @entity12 , but rushing a poor trial into the ground just to prove a political point really is n’t going to win the confidence of the @entity46 public or strike most people as a good use of public money			1
’ dr @entity137 , a geneticist at @entity138 , a non-profit research organisation in @entity139 , said genetic engineering risked introducing unintended dna mutations			0
a genetically engineered crop designed to produce a synthetic form of cod liver oil			1
scientists engineered the plant by ‘ cutting and pasting ’ genes from algae into a tall , spindly flax plant similar to oil seed rape			1
the crop produces the same amount of omega - 3 fatty acids as fish oils			2
supporters claim it will take pressure off the world ’s depleting fish stocks			0
opponents worried about hidden ecological and health risks of the crop , which have not yet been tested			2
she said : ‘ there are more risks than are immediately obvious			0
‘ risks arise not only from the new trait and the interference caused by the new genes but also from the many dna mutations that occur during the engineering processes			0
‘ will the plant still produce all its original nutrients ? will it produce toxins ? will it still be safe to consume ? ’ in the last decade only four @entity12 field trials have been approved - three for blight - resistant potatoes and one , in 2011 , for aphid resistant wheat			1
if it passes the tests it would still have a long way to go before it could be commercially developed			0
only one crop has ever been approved for commercial cultivation in @entity186 , an insect - resistant corn variety given the go - ahead in 1998			0
contentious : the plan will enrage @entity191 campaigners , pictured here in a 2012 protest in @entity16 a spokesman for the @entity8 said : ‘ @entity8 has granted statutory consent to @entity19 to carry out a small - scale field trial of genetically modified ( @entity12 ) camelina plants			1
‘ the @entity12 camelina has been modified to produce omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in its seed oils			1
‘ the trial will test the performance and yield of the @entity198 under field conditions			0
the trial is due to start this spring and run until 2017 on the @entity19 estate in @entity207 , @entity16			0
’ ‘ conditions have been imposed on the trial to ensure that it is conducted safely , and the @entity12 plants will not be allowed to enter the food or feed chain			0
’ @entity19 said : ‘ the controlled experiment will be carried out at @entity19 and sowing of @entity80 seeds will take place by mid-may this year			0
‘ the plants will be harvested august / september 2014 , and a small amount of seed will be used to analyse the oil content , with all the rest of the seed and plant material will be destroyed according to the consent ’s conditions			0
‘ the @entity12 inspectorate of the @entity226 will be carrying out regular inspections			0
’ professor @entity228 , acting director of @entity19 said : ‘ we are delighted to be in position to carry out the field trial and to further assess the potential of these @entity12 plants to contribute , as one of many solutions , to the important environmental sustainability issue of providing omega - 3 fish oils			2

the @entity46 *'s* first genetically modified test in three years
crop is genetically engineered to produce synthetic cod liver oil
plant created by ' cutting and pasting ' genes into another plant
the synthetic cod liver oil could be on shelves by 2020
opponents warn the long - term *impacts* of the crop are *untested*
@entity254 says @entity46 ' museum of world farming ' without @entity12 crops
