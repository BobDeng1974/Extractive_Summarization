by @entity0 it could be the biggest photobomb in history			2
@entity4 's solar observing spacecraft had its uninterrupted view of the sun rudely ruined - by the moon			1
on july 26 , the moon crossed between @entity4 ’s @entity8 and the sun , a phenomenon called a lunar transit			1
the high - definition space observatory orbits the @entity21 in a very special way that our planet rarely slips into shot			0
this happens approximately twice a year , causing a partial solar eclipse that can only be seen from @entity8 's point of view			1
images of the eclipse show a crisp lunar horizon , because the moon has no atmosphere that would distort light			1
this is very different to when the @entity21 blocks the solar view and you can see the hazy upper atmosphere allowing some of the brightest active regions penetrate			0
the @entity8 has been continuously watching the sun since 2009			1
the high - definition space observatory orbits the @entity21 in a very special way that our planet rarely slips into shot			0
the moon , however , crosses its path approximately twice a year			2
by blending different @entity8 wavelengths , @entity4 can get an enhanced image of the sun. this image was the blended result of images taken in 304 wavelength and 171 wavelength			1
the same image in 171 wavelength			0
eruptions on the solar surface can clearly be seen , while swirls of gas are ejected during storms			0
@entity61 hot ! the 304 wavelength is emitted from the chromosphere and transition region			0
@entity8 images of this wavelength are typically colorized in red .			2
