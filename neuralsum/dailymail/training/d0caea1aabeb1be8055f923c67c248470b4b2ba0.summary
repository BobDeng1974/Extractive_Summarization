@entity0 has refused to accept the body of terrorist @entity2 in a sudden u-turn the day before he was expected to be buried in the soil of his birth country			1
the gunman who murdered four hostages in a kosher delicatessen as well as a policewoman was due to be buried in @entity10 today ; instead he remains in a fridge in the @entity12 in @entity13			1
@entity0 authorities have reportedly given no reason for the change of heart , which means @entity2 is now likely to be buried somewhere in @entity17			2
@entity2 killed four customers of a kosher supermarket as well as a policewoman ' if @entity0 refuses to bury him on its territory , he will be buried in @entity17 , ' said government spokesman @entity25 this morning , without elaborating			0
the 32 - year - old small - time dope dealer - cum - terrorist was gunned down by police as they raided the @entity30 kosher supermarket in east @entity13 on january 9 , the day police tracked down @entity33 massacre gunmen @entity31 and @entity34			2
a day earlier he had shot dead a policewoman in the street and critically injured a street sweeper			0
the @entity39 brothers , who were @entity17 of @entity41 heritage , were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - @entity43 in @entity45 and @entity31 in @entity46 , a suburb north of @entity13 - last weekend			1
both were interred at night in unmarked graves , as authorities feared their resting places could become places of pilgrimage for extremists			0
the brothers were killed in a shoot - out after hiding in an industrial unit , two days after the attack on the offices of the satirical magazine @entity33 , in which they killed 12 people			0
@entity33 killers : the @entity39 brothers , who were @entity17 of @entity41 heritage , were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - @entity64 in @entity45 and @entity31 in @entity46 , a suburb north of @entity13 neither brothers ' hometown wanted the terrorists , but were forced to find graves for them by a @entity17 law that grants a right to be buried in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed			1
@entity17 media reports that no request for a grave has been made in @entity78 , the impoverished south @entity13 suburb where @entity2 grew up and where his mother and sister still live , nor in @entity83 , where he was registered to vote			2
so it seems most likely @entity2 will be buried in @entity85 , the @entity13 suburb where he had rented a safe house			1
a spokesman for the town 's mayor said : ' if his family decide to bury him here , i do n't think we 'll be able to avoid it			0
but we hope he will be buried somewhere else			0

@entity99 country gave no reason for rejecting the killer 's body
his corpse remains on ice at the @entity12 in @entity13
it seems likely he will now be buried in @entity13 , where he lived
