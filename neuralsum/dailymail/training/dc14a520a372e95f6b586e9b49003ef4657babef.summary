by @entity0 published : 18:50 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 09:40 est , 26 november 2013 @entity1 failed to name the @entity3 winners sports minister @entity1 was left humiliated after she failed to get a single question right in a basic quiz – on sport			1
the @entity14 mp did not know the name of the current @entity10 women ’s champion			2
she also scored an own - goal by not knowing who won this year ’s @entity3			1
mrs @entity1 bungled her way through five questions and got every answer wrong , even when she tried to cheat by seeking help from an adviser			1
she was quizzed in a toe - curling exchange with @entity26			0
asked who won the women ’s title at @entity10 , she replied : ‘ it ’s not one of us			0
‘ i know @entity33 did it for us , which is absolutely fantastic and that ’s the important thing			0
’ the correct answer was @entity4 of @entity38			0
next she was asked who the @entity3 holders were			1
a slightly anxious - looking mrs @entity1 said : ‘ come on , help , ’ before replying : ‘ @entity41 because it ’s my favourite club			1
’ most football fans would know if their team had won such a coveted trophy			0
the correct answer was @entity2			0
mrs @entity1 did not even attempt to name the @entity46 captain ( @entity7 ) simply replying : ‘ what about hockey ? ’ perhaps taking pity on her , the presenter asked her when the football team in her constituency , @entity53 , had left the football league			1
mrs @entity1 conceded : ‘ these are hard questions ’ before adding ‘ last year ’			1
the correct answer was 1992			0
finally , she was asked which paralympian had won the most gold medals at @entity58			0
an adviser whispered the answer which mrs @entity1 parroted : @entity60			1
but the correct answer was @entity62 swimmer @entity61			0
afterwards mrs @entity1 said : ‘ i was n’t told there was going to be a quiz thrown in at the end of an interview			1
if i ’d known i would have done some proper revision			0
‘ my sports pub quiz knowledge may not be encyclopaedic but i completely understand the positive impact that participating in sport has on people ’s lives			2
’ last month , the mp for @entity74 and the @entity75 said that sport was in her dna shortly after being promoted to sports minister			0
she had widely been tipped for the sack in the reshuffle			0
@entity2 beat @entity81 1 - 0 during this year 's final before being demoted out of the @entity83 @entity7 ( left ) carried @entity6 's hopes of a @entity85 through this year 's @entity87 campaign before losing to @entity88 in the final , while @entity4 beat @entity90 to take the @entity10 women 's title during her youth , according to her parliamentary website , she was captain of her school tennis and hockey teams and represented @entity97 at hockey , tennis , athletics , and cross country			1
she later became under - 16 judo champion in the north of @entity6 and southern @entity104			2
mrs @entity1 is not the only sports minister to be left floundering after being ambushed in a quiz			1
@entity109 ’s @entity108 suffered a similar fate in 2001 , when the @entity112 ’s @entity111 asked him a string of questions about sport			2
mr @entity108 did not know that @entity116 was the then captain of the @entity118 rugby team , could not name a single jockey riding in that week ’s @entity120 and could not identify three of the four semi-finalists at the @entity123 tennis tournament			2
he made a gallant stab at naming @entity6 ’s cricket coach , declaring he was ‘ the @entity62 ’ ... but @entity126 was actually from @entity127 .			2

@entity1 was given a *surprise* quiz during an interview
failed to get any of the five questions right
could *n't* name @entity3 winners or @entity6 rugby captain
