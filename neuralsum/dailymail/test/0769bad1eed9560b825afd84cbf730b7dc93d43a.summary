a @entity0 suffered three degree burns from a pad used to keep him warm during a scan which vets had heated up in a microwave			1
twelve - year - old @entity6 underwent a general anaesthetic for an mri scan at the @entity10 clinic in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the pet , who is also completely deaf , had the scan , last month after his owner @entity16 from @entity17 in @entity18 , noticed a lump behind his ear			1
@entity6 's owner @entity16 , said she only realised something was wrong with the pet when he started to refuse food and found puss oozing from his back but when @entity6 returned from the clinic she realised something was wrong when he started refusing food and found puss oozing from his back			1
she then took him to a local vet , where staff clipped his fur and exposed the severe burns in his back			0
ms @entity16 , 64 , then discovered that a pad used to keep her dog warm while he had the scan got too hot after it was heated in a microwave			1
she said : ' i just do n't understand how it could have been taken from the microwave and then put directly onto @entity6 without it being noticed how hot it was			2
@entity6 , who suffered three degree burns after vets place a heat pad on his back that had been warmed in a microwave ' they have told me that they always warm them up in microwave but after what happened they have promised to change their practice			1
' i am glad that they ’ve now said they will do that but it took nearly a week for them to stop the practice			0
' @entity6 is now on medication while his wounds heal , but could face surgery to remove some of the skin around the burns			2
ms @entity16 , an interfaith minister , is now calling on all vets to ensure they heat up the pads correctly and monitor them adequately			1
the @entity10 confirmed their vets are now using an incubator to heat the pads			2
a spokesman said : ' we pioneered the use of @entity75 in animals back in the 1990s and since then we have scanned more than 20,000 animals			0
' in the last five years , around 3,000 of these patients would have had heat pads to maintain their body temperature			0
' to the best of our knowledge , we have never seen anything like this before in any of the @entity10 ’s patients			0
' we understand how upsetting this situation must be for @entity16 and her family , and have carried out a full investigation			0
' we have reviewed , and are updating , our @entity89 for the use of heat pads			0
' we are also standardising the way in which all heat pads are heated at the @entity10			0
' @entity6 , who is also deaf , is now on medication while his wounds heal , but could face surgery to remove some of the skin around the burns			2

@entity6 had a heat pad placed on him during an @entity75 at a clinic
but vets had warmed it up in a microwave rather than in an incubator
after his owner @entity16 then *suspected* something was wrong
the 12 - year - old pet was then found to have suffered three degree burns
