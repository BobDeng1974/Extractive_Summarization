by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 have been announced as @entity7 vice-captains to @entity9 skipper @entity8			1
captain @entity8 named @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 as the final three members of his playing team for @entity15 on tuesday , and the @entity16 has now finalised his back - room staff			1
the big - name trio are synonymous with @entity9 success , with 17 @entity7 appearances between them , and now form a five - strong line - up behind @entity8 , who had already appointed @entity23 and @entity24 as his deputies			1
the 48 - year - old @entity60 also led the team to victory two years ago as captain during the miracle at @entity65 and shed tears in the memory of @entity59			0
' @entity5 's passion for the @entity7 is recognised the world over , ' said @entity8			1
' it was obvious in his legendary partnership with @entity59 and was also so very apparent two years ago at @entity65 , so i 'm delighted he has accepted my invitation to be involved again , once more maintaining that important continuity			0
' @entity3 is a three - time major champion and made six appearances in the match as a player , but he has suffered a slump in form and is now ranked as low as 287th in the world			0
the 43 - year - old @entity16 was nowhere near qualifying for the team this year			0
' @entity3 is my oldest friend on @entity83 and is a guy i have known most of my life , ' said @entity8			1
' we went to school together , came through the amateur ranks together and have been together in many contests for both @entity90 and @entity9 over the years , so i know what he can bring to the team room			0
' on top of the world : captain @entity5 ( top ) celebrates @entity9 's miracle at @entity65 in 2012 captain : @entity8 vice-captains : @entity3 @entity4 @entity5 @entity24 @entity23 @entity3 said : ' i am really looking forward to being part of the @entity7 from a different angle to the playing side			1
that aspect of things is something that really interests me and i 'm therefore delighted that @entity8 has given me the opportunity			0
' @entity4 , the evergreen spaniard , has played in the @entity7 four times and was touted earlier in the year as a genuine wildcard selection following his victory at the @entity111 in may , but the 50 - year - old 's form faded over the summer			2
' @entity4 is someone that the spectators love as well as being very popular with all the players , ' said @entity8			2
' however , he is also a person that i respect very much			0
' @entity8 added : ' i know it 's been common in the past to have three or four vice-captains but i 've gone for five because i feel an extra person is justified due to the additional workload which comes from being the home team , in addition to how well i saw such a system working when we ended up having five vice captains under @entity127 at @entity128 in 2010			2
the opposition : @entity131 captain @entity130 revealed his three wildcard picks in @entity133 on tuesday ' i have complete confidence and trust in all five of my vice-captains and the help they will give me in the difficult quest of trying to retain the @entity7			2
' @entity9 will try to retain the trophy against the @entity131 at @entity15 from september 26 - 28			1
