the bells of @entity1 have been ringing since the first half of the 18th century , when @entity4 composer @entity3 donated them in exchange for the church 's organ			1
they have been a part of daily life in @entity12 near @entity13 , ever since , but they may be silenced after almost 300 years , because one person thinks they are too noisy			1
a petition by local residents urging the church to keep the bells playing has prompted talks between the frustrated resident and the vicar of the 13th century @entity25 church , reverend @entity26			1
threat of silence : the bells of @entity1 in @entity12 near @entity13 may be forced to stop ringing after one resident complained that they are too noisy historic : the church had an organ when it was built in 1250 , but @entity4 - born composer @entity3 swapped it in the 18th century for a peal of bells because he liked the ' mellow tones ' the @entity38 listed church was built in 1250 and had an organ until @entity3 , a @entity40 composer famous for his operas and oratorios , is said to have swapped it for a peal of bells in the 18th century - simply because he liked its mellow tones			1
some of the bells were made by the @entity47 from nearby @entity48			2
an inscription on the smallest bell says : ' i value not who doth me see , for @entity53 casted me , althow my sound it is but small , i can be heard among you all			0
' the petition against the single complaint , which is growing strength , asks the church to take ' no action '			1
it describes the bells as ' a valued local tradition and need to be retained to reach the proposed extensions to the town '			1
@entity66 , who wants to come to an agreement with the aggrieved party , said : ' at the end of the day , we want to be good neighbours to everyone			2
there is a wonderful community spirit here in @entity12 ' he said			1
' our churches are a key part of it and celebrating and enhancing that spirit is very important to us			2
' campaigner , @entity79 , 52 , a sports coach , said : ' i ’ve lived in @entity12 most of my life and everyone i ’ve spoken to likes the bells regardless of whether they go to church or not			1
' the church is 700 years old so bell ringing is n’t new and tends to have a positive association , plus the bells are n’t constantly ringing			1
' @entity92 up : the complaint is said to have been made in the @entity94 , which is 300m away the complainer is said to live near the church in @entity94 , a development of retirement flats 300m away from the church			1
but none of the occupants spoken to have owned up to being the voice of protest			0
@entity104 , 67 , who has lived there for 14 years , said the place used to have a ' nice community spirit ' but recently people had started to disagree over things like parking			2
she added : ' do n’t buy a house near the church if you do n’t like the bells , simple as that			2
' @entity116 , 69 , said : ' they used to go off a lot more - before i even got up in the morning - but they have n’t as much for the last few week since somebody complained			0
' if they were right on top of me i might feel differently , but i do n’t mind them at all			0
' campaign : around 70 local residents have signed a petition urging for the church not to take action retired @entity130 , 67 , added : ' surely there are more important things in this world to worry about than church bells			1
they do n’t just ring them , they play hymns and songs and they really are lovely			0
i do n’t see why they should stop because one person complains			0
' @entity145 said its environmental health department had not received any complaint about the bells			2
two years ago church leaders at the @entity151 ’ @entity150 , in @entity152 , @entity153 , 17 miles away were given a noise abatement notice after a newcomer complained about their bells			1
reverend @entity157 was told by @entity159 environmental health officers not to switch off bells between 11pm and 7am or face prosecution			2
the switching off caused fury among residents , many of whom said they relied on the chimes to know the time			0
messiah composer : @entity3 @entity3 was born in @entity4 in 1685 and , despite being told not to meddle with instruments by his father , he developed a propensity for music in his childhood			1
in 1712 , he decided to settle permanently in @entity174 following a number of visits and popular performances			0
he then became a naturalised @entity179 subject , with the backing of @entity181 , in 1727 and would go on to complete one of his most famous compositions , @entity184 , in @entity185 in 1742			0
when he arrived , he travelled around the country , visiting various schools and churches , including @entity189 's in @entity12 , to perform his oratorios or simply listen to music			2
but his time in @entity174 was mainly based on writing @entity194 opera for the @entity179 stage , which came with a mixed success			0
between 1711 and 1739 , more than 25 of @entity3 's operas were premiered in the @entity198 ( now the @entity200 's ) theatre			0
but after losing money on his productions , he turned his attention to oratorios , an area where he had already received royal approval			0
one of his four @entity207 , @entity208 ( 1727 ) , composed for the coronation of @entity210 of @entity174 , has been performed at every subsequent @entity179 coronation , traditionally during the sovereign 's anointing			0
@entity3 composed more than forty operas in over thirty years , and since the late 1960s , with the revival of baroque music and historically informed musical performance , interest in @entity3 's operas has grown			0
after his death in 1759 , he was buried in @entity220			0
talks : reverend @entity222 , who is believed to be setting up a meeting with the frustrated resident , said : ' at the end of the day , we want to be good neighbours to everyone '			1
