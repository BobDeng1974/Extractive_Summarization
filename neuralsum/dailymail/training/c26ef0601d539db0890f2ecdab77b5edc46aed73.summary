he will have a further assessment on thursday when he is due to see an ankle specialist			1
@entity18 would probably sideline him until march , but even without an operation he will miss up to three months			1
‘ it does not look good , ’ admitted @entity2 manager @entity20			2
‘ there is no bone damage but there is ligament damage			1
it is just how [ long ] it is , which we should know next week			2

the challenge left @entity0 on the pitch in agony as he now faces the possibility of undergoing surgery the 22 - year - old 's ( bottom ) injury adds to a miserable run of luck for the @entity60 the @entity2 manager said : ‘ the tackle caught him from the side , just when he had moved the ball a bit forwards too much			1
then , when he dived to make the pass , @entity9 came in to make the tackle and took him from the back and the side			1
‘ when you see the picture , it is very bad			2
i do n’t think it was a tackle with the desire to hurt			1

it was a bad foul			2

we are the team who has the least shots against us in the @entity86			0

there ’s a lot of positives but , at the end of the day , you either win or lose			0
it depends on very little things sometimes			0
‘ when you are so long in football , you do n’t really understand what crisis means			0
i best get to the dictionary			0
‘ i believe in what i do and i believe especially in my players			0
i question myself every day and i hope you do that as well			0
