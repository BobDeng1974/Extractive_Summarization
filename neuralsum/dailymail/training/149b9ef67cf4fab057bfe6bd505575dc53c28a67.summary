seen here for the first time , @entity8 , 54 , is pictured next to her nephew @entity11 , who arrived in @entity3 from @entity12 just days before mr @entity4			1
now both ms @entity8 and mr @entity11 are in quarantine along with her 13 - year - old son and a friend			2
while 42 - year - old mr @entity4 's life continues to hang in the balance , district attorney @entity16 has revealed that his office is actively investigating whether or not mr @entity4 will face criminal prosecution should he recover			1
a spokesperson for the @entity22 has told @entity23 that he could face the charge of @entity25 – with the ebola virus as that weapon			1
if convicted this carries a jail term of two to 20 years			1
prayer : @entity8 , 54 , the ' wife ' of @entity4 sitting on the steps of her apartment before with nephew @entity11 , who is also now in quarantine with her hope : ms @entity8 told her pastor that she broke down in prayer on hearing @entity4 is getting a new drug @entity37 said , ' we are investigating whether mr @entity4 exposed the public to a deadly virus knowingly which would be criminal intent			1
we are looking at what he said on record at the hospital and to the people he was with and around			2
' ms @entity37 revealed that the @entity22 had received several complaints from members of the public angry at the revelation that mr @entity4 allegedly lied on exit documents which asked if he had been exposed to the dreaded virus			1
meanwhile , it also emerged that a gofundme site set up to raise money for @entity4 and his medical treatment had only seen $ 50 donated ( of a target $ 100,000 ) in the six days it has been active - despite the huge publicity his case has raised and the terrible fight for survival he finds himself in			1
the day before he was due to travel he carried a pregnant woman home when she was desperately sick with @entity5 and had been denied treatment at a @entity12 hospital			1
she later died of the illness			2
ms @entity37 said that this was something the @entity22 was taking ' very seriously '			1
she said : ' it 's the @entity69 ’s role to keep the public safe and you just ca n't have people circumventing procedures and thinking that they can just hop on a plane , lie on documents , from @entity12 and just enter the country here in @entity77 thinking that there are no consequences '			2
prosecution : officials told @entity23 that @entity4 faces a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon if he recovers because he lied on forms to come into the country			1
pictured here arriving on @entity7 soil the @entity22 has previously successfully prosecuted an hiv positive man who had unprotected sex , while knowingly infected , with the charge currently being considered in mr @entity4 's case			1
but ms @entity37 added ‘ on a humane level we 're saddened that somebody is fighting for their life			2
here ’s someone who tried to help a pregnant woman and your heart does go out to him			0
' it would be inhumane to prosecute someone on their deathbed so we 're treading very lightly on this one			0
we 're weighing all of that			0
it 's a very delicate matter '			0
mr @entity4 ’s condition remains critical though his family have drawn hope from the fact that he started receiving experimental drug treatment on saturday afternoon			1
@entity114 , senior pastor at @entity115 , where ms @entity8 is a member , is in daily contact with the stricken woman as she and her family wait out their 21 days of isolation ,			1
he said : ' i can tell you that @entity8 just began to thank @entity123 and broke out in praise when she heard that they were giving @entity126 the experimental drug			1
' she was so deeply relieved that they could begin that			0
it has cheered her tremendously			0
' earlier pastor @entity114 told @entity23 of the family 's relief at having been moved from the @entity2 – which ms @entity8 describes as an ' apartment of sickness ' – to a secret location within city limits			2
ms @entity8 , who has a 19 - year - old son by mr @entity4 , left @entity12 more than a decade ago after a falling out saw the couple split			1

many commentors on the page are angry over @entity4 's false claim that he had n't been exposed to the virus before traveling to the @entity7 care : @entity4 's mother , @entity160 , was driven 15 hours from @entity161 , @entity162 , to be by @entity4 's bedside he said : ' @entity8 has n't been out of the country in a long time			1
when they reconnected it was over the telephone			0
their relationship had never led to marriage in @entity12 but that is what they were talking of when mr @entity4 came here			1
' pastor @entity114 and his congregation have shown nothing but compassion for ms @entity8 and her family during their ordeal with the faith community funding their stay in this new location and providing meals and support			1
but a @entity186 page set up by mr @entity4 's nephew , @entity150 , has shown a different face to this crisis with just $ 50 donated since october 1			1
it reads : ' mr. @entity191 is the first diagnosed case of @entity5 within the @entity7			1
he came to visit with his son and watch him graduate high school			0
@entity126 needs your help to assist with the costs incurred by medical treatment			0
he is fighting for his life in an isolation unit in @entity201			0
please support his cause in donating to this noble charity			2
thanks for your consideration ! ' instead of raising funds it has seen criticism heaped upon mr @entity4 by members of the public angry at the alleged lie that allowed him and his deadly virus , into the country			1
commentors have largely been unkind and lambasted the ' audacity ' of the page			2
one states that mr @entity4 should be ' charged with attempted murder if he survives '			1
for now his survival depends entirely on the treatment he is receiving at @entity220			0
and just who is footing the medical bill that has already run to tens of thousands of dollars remains unclear			2
@entity23 has put the question to @entity220 and is awaiting a response			0
meanwhile , mr @entity4 's mother has traveled to be close to her son as he fights for his life against the deadly virus			1
@entity229 , was driven 15 hours by family members from her home in @entity161 , @entity162 to @entity3 on monday where she hopes to find a way to talk to her son			1
in a video message filmed for her son with @entity235 last week , mrs @entity160 said : ' i love you			0

my whole thinking is on you			0

@entity241 landed in @entity3 this morning having come , he tweeted , ‘ upon request of family # @entity244 … to bring comfort & to seek best humanitarian relief @entity7 has to offer			1
’ he spent the morning with community leaders at the @entity248 and will lead a prayer vigil outside the hospital at 5pm this afternoon			0
a spokesman for the hospital said on tuesday afternoon : ' mr. @entity4 remains in critical condition			1
he is on a ventilator and receiving kidney dialysis			0
his liver function , which declined over the weekend , has improved , but doctors caution that this could vary in coming days			2
he will continue to receive the investigational medication brincidofovir			0
' speaking to @entity23 @entity260 who represents district 13 in which @entity262 is located complained about the negative stigma that the case has brought the area			0
she said : ' i 've had 15 men come to me today , turned away from their jobs			0
i 've referred them to lawyers through legal aid			0
they work at various @entity3 based companies and have been told not to come back for 21 days unless they can provide a note from the @entity277			1
' ground zero : the final clean up of @entity8 's apartment has been carried out			0
@entity4 was staying there safety : @entity8 and three others who were in the apartment are now at an undisclosed location donated by others ms @entity287 stressed that none of these men were being tracked or traced by the @entity290 and that none were considered in any way ' at risk '			2
she said that addressing the fundamental misunderstanding and fear that governs such decisions was her priority in ensuring that an already vulnerable community did not suffer further			0
she said : ' in order to understand what ’s happening you have to understand the community			0
@entity262 is 3 square miles and 25,000 people living in 94 multi-family complexes			0
' it ’s a high - density population and the average income is very low			2
there is a high number of immigrant families and a lot of agencies place refugees there because of the affordable houses			0
' she said that the cultural diversity which meant that an estimated 40 languages and dialects are spoken in this small area presented real challenges when trying to disseminate vital information			0
ms @entity287 was instrumental in pushing for the family at the center of the crisis to be relocated from their cramped and contaminated apartment			2
she said she has spoken to an ' enormously relieved ' @entity8 on friday shortly before she was relocated			0
that apartment has now been decontaminated in two phases and at an estimated cost of $ 65.000			2
ms @entity287 said she did not know whether the family would ever return to the apartment and that the details of what might happen once their ordeal is resolved have not yet been discussed .			2

@entity4 could face the charge - which carries a sentence of up to 20 years - if he survives and is charged
@entity22 said it is something they are ' taking seriously ' after @entity4 lied on forms about his exposure to @entity5 to get on a plane to @entity7
meanwhile , a gofundme set up for him has only raised $ 50 in six days
@entity347 on the page expressed anger that he had been *deceitful*
@entity151 flew into to @entity3 on tuesday to support the family
@entity4 remains in a critical but stable condition with a slight improvement after being given an experimental drug
