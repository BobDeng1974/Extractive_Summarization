by @entity0 it is the vital piece of legislation without which two of @entity5 's killers would have escaped justice			1
the joint enterprise law , also known as common purpose , enables several people to be prosecuted for the same crime , regardless of who delivered the fatal blow , and is hailed by lawyers as an essential tool to use in the fight against gang crime			1
yet the @entity17 spent licence fee money on commissioning a 90 - minute drama railing against what lawyers describe as a ' powerful ' and useful piece of legislation designed to stop criminals getting away with it by blaming each other			1
it told the story of a young boy who drove his friends off to get pizza , only to become involved in a murder when they stabbed another youth to death			0
the boy , @entity58 , played by @entity59 , was then charged with murder under joint enterprise			2
throughout the drama , @entity46 's view - that all should go free rather than one semi-innocent participant be jailed along with the murderer - was hammered home , and the drama was followed by footage of three women ' blaming ' the joint enterprise law for their relatives being jailed			1
the film was followed by brief clips of women talking about relatives they believed had been ' wrongly convicted of murder ' under the joint enterprise law			1
joint enterprise law , which dates back to 1846 , was designed to stop criminals evading justice by blaming each other			1
high profile cases where the law was used included that of @entity5 and @entity5 , who were convicted under joint enterprise for the 1993 murder of @entity5			1
@entity5 was stabbed to death by a gang of youths in a racially - motivated murder at a bus stop in @entity93 when he was 18			2
it was also used in the 2012 case of the murder of @entity97 , a 19 - year - old who was shot dead in a car outside a @entity100 pub in a gang attack			1
@entity47 played @entity102 , the youth who drove his friends to get pizza but got caught up in a murder writer @entity46 , left , used @entity31 to rant against the law that was used to convict two of the racist youths who murdered 18 - year - old @entity5 , right , in south - east @entity108 in 1993 today @entity113 , of pressure group the @entity109 , which campaigns for greater impartiality from the @entity17 and against the licence fee , accused the corporation of failing ' to serve the public interest ' by commissioning such a ' one - sided film '			1
he told @entity117 : ' @entity46 deliberately set out to make a one - sided film , and the scenes at the end left the viewer in no doubt of his intentions			2
' the @entity17 's @entity124 states the the corporation exists to serve the public interest			1
it is not in the public interest to broadcast a drama with such obvious political motivations that do not educate , but instead try to rubbish a law that has helped put many violent criminals behind bars			1
' if there is a debate to be had about joint enterprise , this is not the way to have it			0
' and senior lawyer @entity139 , head of business crime at @entity141 , insisted that the joint enterprise law was a good thing , and that its advantages outweighed its disadvantages			1
he also said the law was becoming even more important as gang crime in @entity148 is on the increase			2
' it 's a controversial law , but the benefit of it is that it provides a deterrent and that is particularly the case with gang - related crime , ' mr @entity139 said			1
' the doctrine in short allows someone to be prosecuted for any offence , though usually it is murder , if they participated in an activity if they knowingly assisted or encouraged the crime and agreed to act together			0
@entity31 , written by @entity164 and @entity165 author @entity46 , attacked the fundamental principle of justice known as joint enterprise ' with murder it may be sufficient that they set out to cause serious injury but not to kill			1
' he added : ' it has been used more frequently in recent years with the increase in gang - related crime			0
' a study released earlier this year showed that in the last eight years , there were 4,500 prosecutions for murder involving two or more defendants , and just under 2,000 prosecutions for murder involving four or more defendants , and those would have used the joint enterprise provisions			2
' it 's a powerful tool that can enable the prosecution to get at people where there is no direct evidence that they pulled the trigger or plunged the knife in			0
' it was famously used in the @entity5 case and that of @entity97 , and that is where it has been deployed to best effect			0
' if it can deter young men or women from joining gangs and using knives , then arguably it outweighs the concerns that the law is too draconian in its reach			1
' a spokesman for the @entity206 said : ' the @entity5 case is perhaps the best known example of the usefulness of joint enterprise to prosecutors			1
despite all of the evidence available , we still do not know for certain who exactly stabbed @entity5 , but the law enabled us to successfully prosecute two men for murder			2
@entity31 looked at the predicament of a boy , played by @entity47 , who got caught up in a murder ' however , our guidance makes clear that prosecutors should give careful consideration to which charges are appropriate and whether a prosecution is in the public interest			2
the suspect 's age and their level of culpability are important factors in these decisions			0
' we never prosecute a person just for being present at the scene of a crime			0
prosecutors look for evidence that a person could have foreseen what might happen – such as knowledge that a member of their party was armed , for example - and that they took an active role in the offence , either directly or by assisting or encouraging it			0
' a @entity248 select committee is currently examining the principle of joint enterprise , which will be discussed on @entity252 tomorrow night			0
a @entity17 spokesman said : ' the @entity17 has a tradition of providing a platform for writers to make dramas about causes they ’re passionate about			0
' the @entity17 is exploring all the views surrounding the debate including a documentary tonight at 10.35pm and a @entity252 debate on tuesday night			0
' @entity117 contacted a spokesman for mr @entity46 for a comment			0
joint enterprise dates back to 1846 , when two drunken delivery drivers decided to race their horse - drawn carts along a busy track on the @entity272 / @entity271 borders			2
@entity273 and @entity274 , both of whom were driving carts laden down with heavy items of pottery , egged each other on and hurled abuse at pedestrians who told them to stop as they tore along the country road			0
eventually , one of them hit an elderly pedestrian , @entity286 , killing him , though there were no witnesses around to say who did it			0
in court , both defendants blamed each other so the judge , lord @entity294 , decided that while only one of them must have hit the man , both of them had been drunk and reckless , and either could have done it			0
so he found both of them guilty of manslaughter and jailed them both , establishing a precedent that still stands in law today , and in other legal systems from the @entity306 to @entity307 .			0

@entity31 , which aired on @entity17 last night , *focused* on joint enterprise law
the drama hammered home a vehement *message* that the law was wrong
the 1846 law stops criminals evading justice by each blaming the other
@entity46 's drama showed one - sided view , but senior lawyer says it 's vital
@entity141 's @entity139 says it 's often used in gang crime
he says ' powerful ' law is a useful deterrent to stop young men joining gangs
the @entity109 said @entity17 had failed to serve the public interest
pressure group 's @entity113 said corporation should not ' rubbish the law that has helped put many violent criminals behind bars '
used to convict @entity5 and @entity5 in @entity5 murder
law was also used in the 2012 murder of @entity97 in @entity100
@entity206 spokesman says : ' we never prosecute a person just for being present '
