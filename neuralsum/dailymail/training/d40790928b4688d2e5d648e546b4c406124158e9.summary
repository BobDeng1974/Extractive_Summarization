by @entity0 @entity1 is convinced that @entity2 will be a resounding success at @entity4			1
the 62 - year - old will assume his position as @entity8 boss next week after taking charge of @entity10 in their @entity11 third - place play - off against @entity13 on saturday			1
@entity14 had hoped to sign off with a @entity11 winner 's medal around his neck , but those hopes were extinguished by @entity19 , who beat the @entity21 4 - 2 in a penalty shootout at the @entity23 on wednesday			1
@entity4 we stand : @entity2 will be a roaring success at @entity4 , says @entity1 @entity10 failed to test the @entity19 goalkeeper until the 98th minute , but @entity14 should take credit for the way he kept @entity29 quiet in @entity30			1
@entity4 's new manager also achieved a spectacular 5 - 1 win over reigning champions @entity34 in the group stages , so things are looking good for the 20 - time @entity38 champions next year			1
' there was only one thing for this coach - he just wanted to win this cup , ' @entity1 said			2
' that is the type of coach he is - he just wants to win things			2
' he is desperate to be successful and i am sure he is going to be successful in his next job			2
' any visitor to @entity10 's training ground in @entity50 during their stay at the @entity11 will have been impressed by the relaxed and friendly mood in the camp			1
in action : @entity1 ( right ) , tackling @entity29 , has faith in the new @entity58 boss the players laughed and joked during training ; their families were welcome , as were the media			2
in the dressing room , @entity14 has brought harmony too			1
' the team spirit is amazing , ' former @entity65 man @entity1 said			1
' the coach was leading us and the 23 players were really important			2
' everyone played apart from ( third - choice goalkeeper ) @entity72 , and that says a lot about this team			0
' we are not 11 players , we are 22 players and an enormous staff of 26 people and everyone played their part in this success			1
' @entity1 brands @entity10 's run to the last four a success , but there was still a huge feeling of disappointment as the players trudged off the pitch after @entity90 had saved from @entity91 and @entity92			1
crunch time : @entity19 's penalty hero was goalkeeper @entity90 , seding them through to the final ' to lose on penalties is very hard , ' the 33 - year - old said			1
' we were so close to reaching the final			0
' now it does n't feel like a good achievement			0
but you look at the team , and the young players we have			0
' five or six of those players today are in the @entity21 league and are in the semi-final of the @entity11			1
we can be very proud of the team			0
' we believed in ourselves and surprised many people			0
we had a lot of critics in the beginning but beat some very good teams , and against @entity19 we defended like lions			0
' the pain of exiting the tournament was enhanced by the fact that @entity19 were far from at their peak in @entity30			0
@entity121 's team only registered two shots on target in normal time , and @entity29 floundered after being man - marked by @entity126			2
slammed : @entity1 , battling @entity127 , was not impressed with @entity19 ' i do n't think we were impressed by them , ' @entity1 said bluntly			0
' if you watch the game defensively , our defence was playing against @entity29 , ( @entity90 ) @entity134 , ( @entity135 ) @entity136 and more players who are at the top of the game			0
' in attack we wanted to give some harder times to them but they had two defensive lines of four			0
' much to @entity14 's dismay , @entity10 must now play @entity13 on saturday for the dubious honour of finishing third , rather than fourth			1
@entity1 did not sound too enthused by the prospect of a third - place play - off either , but he would still like to end the summer with a win			0
he added : ' we did so well			0
we came so far that it would be a shame to go home with two losing games			0
