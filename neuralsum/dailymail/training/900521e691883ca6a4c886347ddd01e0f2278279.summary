it was one small step for little @entity1 … but a giant leap forward for him and his family			2
the three - year - old was born with a condition that left him with movement problems and unable to communicate properly			1
but thanks to a special ‘ space suit ’ , he is making great strides towards overcoming his difficulties and learning to make his way in the world			1
@entity1 , who suffers from a condition that left him with movement problems , is able to walk thanks to a special ' space suit ' baby steps : the three - year - old 's parents feared @entity1 might never walk until they found the specialist therapy not offered by the @entity19 his parents @entity21 , 30 , and @entity22 , 28 , a steel worker , feared @entity1 , who has global development delay , might never walk			1
they had almost given up hope until they began researching specialist therapies on the internet not offered by the @entity19			1
they discovered the @entity29 , an assemblage of yellow rubber cords pioneered in @entity32 in the early 1970s to counteract the muscle wastage which astronauts experienced during long trips in space because of the lack of gravity			2
it was later developed in @entity40 by therapists @entity42 and @entity43 , who have a daughter with cerebral palsy , as a way of helping disabled children gain the strength and endurance needed for movement			0
it works by retraining the body to correct movement and reflexes			1
all the elements of the suit are connected with each other through the system of rubber cords and therapists can adjust it to hold the body in proper physical alignment			2
@entity1 had his first block of £ 5,000 - a - month therapy using the suit , which also has knee pads , over the festive period at @entity68 in @entity70 centre in @entity71 , @entity72 - and to his parents ’ delight has now taken 11 steps in a row			1

she said : ‘ when all of this started we had no idea what would happen with @entity1 , but to hear a specialist tell us that she was sure @entity1 would walk - that was just massive for us			1
‘ when he was in the suit on christmas eve he took 11 unaided steps			2
it was the best @entity98 present we could have ever hoped for and it really was a miracle			0
’ miss @entity21 , also mother to @entity99 , one , and @entity100 , 12 , added : ‘ @entity1 ’s condition affects all parts of his development so the therapy has been targeting all areas			2
‘ it ’s all through play therapy so he does n’t realise he ’s doing any work			0
‘ wearing the specialised suit is the equivalent of running a marathon			0
after he has been in the suit for a few minutes , connections have been made in his brain so he knows what muscles to use			0
’ @entity1 had his first block of £ 5,000 - a - month therapy using the suit over the @entity98 period @entity1 's mother said just to be told by the therapists there was hope her son would walk was ‘ amazing ’ @entity1 began the therapy last month and has been doing four days a week for three hours a day			1
