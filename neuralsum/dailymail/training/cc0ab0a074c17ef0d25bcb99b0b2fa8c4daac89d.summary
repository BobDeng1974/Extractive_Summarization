by @entity0 published : 16:50 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 01:37 est , 3 october 2013 @entity1 who has campaigned for prisoners to win the right to vote			1
he murdered his landlady with an axe clamour for @entity6 to leave the @entity7 intensified last night , after the only @entity6 judge on the panel called for axe murderers to be given the vote			1
the remark from @entity13 , a bureaucrat who has never sat as a judge in this country , shocked mps			1
‘ if you are killed by an axe murderer , i would still give him the vote – he would have a say , ’ mr @entity13 told a cross-party group of politicians in @entity19			1
the comment appears to be a reference to @entity1 , who served 25 years in prison after killing his landlady with an axe			1
@entity1 has led the campaign for prisoners to be given the vote			1
mr @entity13 claimed the government should back down over its refusal to accept a ruling from his court that @entity6 ’s blanket ban on prisoner votes is illegal			1
he said the decision was just a ‘ fleabite ’ on the independence of @entity6 ’s judicial system – and suggested that defying the @entity7 would damage the country ’s reputation abroad			1
the comments enraged mps at the meeting , which was held to explain how the court works			0
conservative mp @entity47 said mr @entity13 ’s intervention merely strengthened the case for @entity6 withdrawing from it			1
‘ the idea of giving axe murderers the vote is grotesque and has been rejected by a huge majority in @entity55 , ’ he said			0
‘ they have forfeited the right to vote by their crimes			0
it is outrageous for [ mr @entity13 ] to lecture us that the view of a sovereign parliament is less important than that of his court			2
‘ @entity6 has had enough of this court ’s meddling in our affairs			2
it is not fit for purpose and , in my view , we should come out			0
’ @entity72 , a @entity73 mp who also attended the meeting , said ‘ the idea of giving axe murderers the vote will repel most people ’			0
he added : ‘ if you are the family of a victim of such a crime , how would you feel to hear the highest court in @entity82 accord these rights to your loved one ’s killer ? @entity13 , has spent three decades at the @entity87 in @entity19 ‘ from our experience in @entity89 , we would be very concerned about the idea of people convicted of acts of terrorism being given a vote in the democracy they have tried to overthrow			2
’ @entity97 mp @entity96 said mr @entity13 ’s comments reinforced the case for overhauling the @entity19 court			2
‘ the only “ flea ” is the @entity7 sucking the lifeblood out of our democratic authority , with each bite it takes in cases like @entity1 , ’ he said			2
the @entity7 has repeatedly ruled that @entity6 ’s ban on prisoner voting is illegal under the @entity109			1
however , successive governments have refused to change the law , with @entity112 saying the thought of giving prisoners the vote makes him feel ‘ physically sick ’			0
in 2011 , mps voted to maintain @entity6 ’s ban by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22			2
@entity119 , a career eurocrat on £ 150,000 a year justice secretary @entity121 announced last year that a joint committee of mps and peers would consider three options			0
one would see the current ban retained , while the other two would allow some prisoners to vote ; those serving sentences of less than six months , or less than four years			0
ministers will then allow mps to vote on one of these options			0
mr @entity121 said : ‘ the @entity6 public want decisions taken about our democracy to be taken by our @entity55 and not by an international court			0
that is why the @entity140 want wholesale reform of our human rights laws			0
' a spokesman for the @entity7 confirmed there had been an ‘ open and frank exchange ’ of views when mps met @entity7 officials on tuesday			0
he added : ‘ the question of the right to vote of prisoners and the implementation of the judgment “ @entity1 v. the @entity6 ” was discussed			1
judge @entity13 stated that the judgment – concerning an axe murderer – should now be implemented in the wider interest of the convention system , and asked the members of the delegation to encourage this outcome at their level			1

@entity13 told politicians killers should ' have a say '
he appeared to refer to @entity1 , who killed his landlady with an axe
@entity13 claims @entity6 should back down over prisoner votes refusal
