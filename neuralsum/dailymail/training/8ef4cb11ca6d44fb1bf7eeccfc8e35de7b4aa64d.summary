by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:02 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 02:02 est , 8 june 2012 with a little help from @entity4 , one of @entity6 president @entity5 close aides was admitted into @entity8 's prestigious international affairs program			1
in a string of leaked emails between @entity12 and the celebrated broadcaster , ms @entity4 , 82 , promised to her help the 22 - year - old secure a job on @entity19 's @entity18 show and win a place at @entity8			1
apparently only @entity8 took the bait			1
' ms. @entity22 was admitted based solely on the submitted application materials , ' associate @entity8 dean @entity24 said in response to the controversy surrounding her acceptance			2
ms @entity12 , whose father is @entity6 's @entity29 ambassador , was one of @entity31 's closest advisers and one one of three women revealed in an earlier leak to have sent lovestruck emails to the dictator			1
the young woman responded , writing ' you can never be a better mom to your adopted child ( me )			0
' messages leaked by @entity6 rebels in march show her asking another of mr @entity31 's advisers to tell him : ' i love him so so so much and that i miss him			1
' the leak revealed flirtatious and suggestive emails from three admirers , including a provocative photograph of an unknown woman in white lingerie			0
mrs @entity4 first met ms @entity22 when the young woman 's father hosted a cocktail party in his @entity75 apartment in march 2011			1
' ( ms @entity22 ) was bragging that they had a great relationship after she came to her house for a cocktail party , ' a diplomatic source told the newspaper			0
the @entity82 reports that the two women bonded that evening , and an unidentified diplomatic source said that the then - 21 - year - old ' was bragging that they had a great relationship after she came to her house for a cocktail party '			0
that connection came in handy when the veteran reporter began dealing with ms @entity22 on a regular basis leading up the @entity92 ' exclusive televised interview with the @entity6 leader			0
in the interview , ms @entity4 pressed the president about the thousands of deaths of @entity6 citizens and he denied having issued any formal command for such force			2
ms @entity4 and @entity22 continued to talk via email long after the interview aired @entity102 , who published the most recent batch of hacked emails between ms @entity4 and ms @entity22 , reported that the interview was received poorly by @entity6 government officials because it ended up being more harsh on @entity31 than they originally expected			1
shortly after , ms @entity22 emailed ms @entity4 in a panic , writing that she was ' in so much trouble ' over the interview			2
a few weeks later , ms @entity22 had determined that it was time for her to get out of @entity6 and join her father in the @entity43 - all the while remaining extremely loyal to @entity31 , who she called ' the @entity114 '			1
in other emails obtained by @entity116 in march , ms @entity22 wrote that ' this man is loved by his people '			0
upon her move from @entity6 , ms @entity22 applied to @entity8 's @entity120 , and hope to translate her time working as a press aide to @entity31 into a staff position at a major @entity43 news outlet			1
ms @entity4 immediately dismissed any talk of her working for @entity92 since it would be a breach of journalistic ethics			2
instead , she offered to reach out on behalf of the ' dear girl '			0
@entity4 signed emails ' hugs ' and ' love ' the pair appear extremely close , with ms @entity132 signing her emails with ‘ hugs ’ and ‘ love ’ and ms @entity22 promising to bring back jewellery from @entity6 for her so - called adoptive mother			1
their email exchange was obtained by @entity6 opposition forces who then passed them on to @entity102			0
ms @entity4 emailed @entity142 professor @entity141 , former president of @entity143 and vice president of @entity92 , to sing ms @entity22 's praises			1
' she is brilliant , beautiful , speaks five languages			0
anything you can do to help ? ' ms @entity4 wrote at the end of january			2
mr @entity141 responded that while his position at the @entity142 is unconnected to the @entity120 , he would do his best to help , saying that ' through the @entity153 network , i will get them to give her special attention			0
i am sure they will take her			0
' now @entity8 is saying that while she was accepted , mr @entity141 's intervention - if any - had nothing to do with it			1
' we can not comment on an individual applicant ’s materials , which are confidential , ' ms @entity159 said			0
mr @entity141 's son , @entity163 , is the executive producer of @entity54 , was also the recipient of an email from ms @entity4			1
she told ms @entity22 that she wrote to both @entity163 and @entity19 on her behalf and passed along her resume for their consideration , even though she was unsure if they had any availability			2
that specific email was not released			0
neither ms @entity4 nor ms @entity22 heard back from @entity18 or the younger mr @entity141			1
in the wake of the emails , ms @entity4 released a statement expressing her ' regret ' for the questionable decision			1
' in the aftermath ( of the @entity31 interview ) , ms @entity22 returned to the @entity43 and contacted me looking for a job			1
i told her that was a serious conflict of interest and that we would not hire her , ' ms @entity4 said in the statement			2
during her initial response to the allegations , ms @entity4 did not know that the young woman had , in fact , been accepted to the program , but she still expressed her regret			2
' i did offer to mention her to contacts at another media organisation and in academia , though she did n't get a job or into school			0
in retrospect , i realise that this created a conflict and i regret that			0
