by @entity1 reporter published : 11:13 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 14:53 est , 5 july 2013 a journalist has lost the libel lawsuit she filed against a rival station after they aired footage of her in a bikini at a pool party at the home of a man who is a person of interest in the case of his wife 's disappearance			1
@entity15 was an on - air reporter for @entity18 's @entity17 affiliate when the local @entity20 station aired footage of her lounging at a july 6 , 2007 pool party at the home of @entity25			1
@entity25 's wife @entity26 disappeared in april 2007 and he refused to speak to police for much of the investigation			2
the video : stills show @entity15 in her bikini at @entity25 's house that prompted the lawsuit caught on camera : @entity15 worked for @entity17 when she was seen at the house of a man who was suspected of having something to do with his wife 's disappearance months earlier just days after the pool party , @entity20 aired the footage of @entity15 and her children at the @entity44 's pool ; on july 12 @entity25 was formally named as a person of interest in the case			1
@entity15 was fired after the footage aired , and she filed a libel lawsuit against @entity20 as well as @entity25 's neighbor who filmed the video from their property			1
in february 2009 , a @entity55 judge ruled that he would allow four counts of defamation to be considered by the courts , saying that ' the @entity20 newscaster presented the footage with statement made in the form of insinuations and questions regarding @entity15 activities while at the @entity67 home '			1
' these statements ... suggest that @entity15 used improper methods in cultivating sources and obtaining stories , ' judge @entity68 wrote in her ruling			0
fighting back : @entity15 was then fired by @entity17 when @entity20 aired footage of her at ' person of interest ' @entity25 's house and she has sued @entity20 for defamation , but that was just tossed out of court conflict : @entity25 's wife @entity26 disappeared in april 2007 , months before @entity82 was seen at his pool and a year before @entity15 's husband filed for divorce the @entity86 reports today that a different @entity88 judge threw out the lawsuit , saying that some of the parts of the @entity20 report that @entity15 took issue with are ' constitutionally protected expressions of opinion '			1
judge @entity95 went on to write the @entity15 and her lawyer did not provide enough evidence to prove that the content was fabricated			0
this does not seem like the end of the legal drama , however , as @entity15 seems intent on an appeal			0
' we 'd always figured there would be an appeal before this went to trial because there are too many issues , ' @entity15 's lawyer @entity103 told @entity110			0
since her firing , @entity15 has begun working as a radio journalist and was promoted to co-host for a local station in 2010			0
@entity25 is still missing and her case has not progressed since @entity25 was named as a person of interest			2
determined : @entity15 got a call from @entity25 's sister who invited them over for a meeting to talk about the case and they went for a swim with their children @entity25 's body has never been found , and her relatives - as well as her two children - presume that she is dead			1
she and @entity25 were in the middle of getting divorced when she did n't show up to pick up her then - 10 and 12 - year - old children at their school			0
troubled : prior to her disappearance , @entity25 told friends that if anything should happen to her , look at @entity25 after her disappearance , friends and neighbors told of how @entity26 had inquired about a domestic violence shelter , and said to one : ' if anything ever happened to me , look towards @entity25 '			0
@entity15 was one of the two reporters who got access to @entity44 in the days immediately following @entity26 's disappearance , and he initially claimed his innocence			1
police eventually raided his house in the middle of the night shortly after and found 24 guns			0
according to @entity18 magazine , a media relations consultant that was helping @entity25 's family during the investigation told @entity44 's neighbors to have fully charged video cameras aimed at his house at all times in case they spot anything suspicious			1
on july 6 , @entity15 was driving to the local swim club with her two sons when she got a call from @entity25 's sister @entity163 who was visiting from @entity164 with her family to support her brother			2
she told the reporter that she was upset about some of the other network coverage of the case , and asked if she would like to talk about the case with them at @entity25 's home			2
@entity15 agreed after @entity174 said it would be fine for her to bring her two children with her to the home			0
at one point during the interview , @entity15 , @entity174 , and their five collective children all jumped in the pool			0
she said that she and @entity25 were never in the pool at the same time , and looking back she called the decision to go to a source 's house in a bathing suit ' a horrible mistake ' but maintains that there was nothing improper going on between she and the missing woman 's husband .			2

@entity82 was an @entity17 reporter in @entity18 who was covering the disappearance of mother - of - two @entity25 in the spring of 2007
she was fired after footage *revealed* she swam at the pool of @entity44 's *estranged* husband @entity25 who was later named as a person - of - interest
@entity15 has sued rival station @entity20 for defamation after they aired the footage
a @entity18 court threw out the suit saying she did not prove that anything in the footage was untrue
