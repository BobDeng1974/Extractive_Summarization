think of this as the third and final stage of @entity4 ’s @entity3 career			1
we ’ve had the shy and awkward boy wonder , we ’ve had the fully developed , four - time @entity8 winner , now we are in the age of @entity4 the leader			1
he ’s in charge , and he ’s not very happy			0
the @entity3 board and their chosen coach are the principal reasons why he has started to wonder , since the middle of last season , if his future might lie somewhere else			1
it was in december 2013 when , amid talk of a contract renewal , one of the club ’s vice-presidents , @entity25 , said he saw no reason ‘ why the contract of this gentleman should be improved when it was revised only two years ago ’			0
superstar @entity4 , arriving at the @entity8 ceremony , is the man who drives @entity3 on but @entity3 talisman @entity4 has cast doubt over his future with the @entity33 giants @entity4 had his partner @entity34 with him for the award ceremony in @entity36 on monday it was the sarcastic reference to ‘ this gentleman ’ that particularly riled @entity4			1
it suggested a change in attitude towards a player who previous president @entity44 had always treated as the club ’s favourite son			0
more important than the reluctance to improve his terms was the flippancy of the dismissal			0
the tone fitted the theory that the board would not be wholly against the idea of selling @entity4			1
there is a new stadium to be built at a cost of £ 330million , after all , and what if his best years are behind him ? ‘ @entity61 knows nothing about football , ’ responded @entity4			2
‘ he wants to run @entity3 like a business , which it is not			2
’ @entity4 , celebrates @entity65 ( left ) and @entity66 ( centre ) , scored in the weekend win over @entity69 @entity4 has cast doubt over his @entity3 future , admitting on monday ' i do n't know where i 'll be next year ' the player spent december 2013 in @entity74 recovering from injury and when he came back he could n’t prevent the team finishing the season without a trophy			1
@entity4 feels that this board has neither backed nor protected him			2
he has brought some of the off - field problems on himself by failing to declare the correct amount of tax during a three - year period			1
but when that indiscretion encouraged a campaign against him that even had one newspaper , @entity88 , linking his father to a money - laundering ring connected to a drugs cartel , there was no closing of ranks around the star player as there would have been in the past			2
this season the board has been the lesser evil , with coach @entity99 taking charge of the team in the summer			1
@entity102 with @entity4 during the @entity8 ceremony on monday , which the @entity105 star won @entity3 manager @entity99 ( right ) , arrived as manager this summer , has fallen out with star player @entity4 @entity99 left @entity4 on the bench for the first match of the new year - a defeat by @entity111 the man who managed to fall out with both @entity113 and @entity114 at @entity115 picked 27 different teams for his first 27 matches in charge , antagonising senior dressing - room figures in the process			1
he allowed @entity66 and @entity4 to come back two days later than originally planned from the winter break but then left both out of the first game of the new year , which the team lost 1 - 0 to @entity126 ’s @entity111			1
‘ so now i ’m ok to play ? ’ @entity4 is understood to have told his manager when , 1 - 0 down , he asked him to come on at the break			1
that first match of 2015 was a tinker too far			0
across the great @entity133 divide at @entity134 , @entity131 tends to pick his best players for every game			0
@entity99 ’s rotation has smacked of trying too hard to impose himself on a squad of superstars			2
the 27 - year - old ( centre ) scored 50 goals in 52 appearances for @entity3 last season @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 had also been victims of the chopping and changing and none have adequate replacements in a squad poorly assembled by the since - ousted sporting director @entity154			1
@entity4 rowed with his coach on the friday before the @entity111 game , tensions were strained on the sunday of the match and instead of training the following day , he stayed at home and followed @entity160 on @entity161			2
add that piece of social - network manoeuvering to the decision to name @entity165 — for so long pantomime villain of the @entity167 , not least when he poked the late @entity168 in the eye — as third on his list of top coaches , and it is little wonder the seeds of doubt have started to sprout			2
@entity4 celebrates after scoring for @entity3 against @entity69 during sunday 's victory at the @entity177 the idea that @entity4 would never work with @entity165 was quashed in one fell swoop			1
the @entity160 coach has already rubbished the idea that @entity182 restrictions would ever allow @entity160 to make such a move			0
that is true if @entity4 ’s price were his buy - out clause of £ 195m			1
but if he handed in a transfer request the price would fall			0
the player ’s long - term partner @entity34 certainly would n’t object to being closer to her best friend @entity191 , the partner of @entity192			0
could @entity193 really be calling ? playing the transfer - request card is the only way it could happen and that remains the player ’s very last resort in this power play			0
@entity4 ( right ) celebrates with @entity3 team - mates @entity65 ( left ) and @entity66 on sunday night end - of - season elections will bring change to the club			1
former president @entity44 is poised to stand and @entity4 will back one candidate in june and that candidate will win by a landslide			2
anyone who can guarantee that he stays will be given the electorate ’s seal of approval			0
for that to be the case , however , the possibility of him walking away has to exist			0
hence the occasional ‘ i do n’t even know where i will be next year ’ admissions			0
all great clubs follow the lead of one individual			0
sometimes it ’s a gregarious owner or president , sometimes it ’s a charismatic manager and sometimes it ’s an exceptional player			0
there is a power void at @entity3 and @entity4 is ready to fill it			1
now is the winter of his discontent — if he gets the president and coach he wants , in june it will be a glorious summer .			0

@entity4 has fallen out with @entity3 boss @entity99
