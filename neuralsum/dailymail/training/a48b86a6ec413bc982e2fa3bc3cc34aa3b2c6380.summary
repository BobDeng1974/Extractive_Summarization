sticking false eyelashes on pets is the next online craze , if photos posted by @entity13 social media users are anything to go by			1
the strangely unsettling shots surfaced on the @entity17 blog , which covers the more bizarre end of life in @entity13 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
' allo gorgeous ! someone , somewhere has decided dogs ' faces are n't expressive enough - and would be improved with the use of fake eyelashes			1
the photos emerged on the @entity13 culture blog @entity17 unsettling : once seen , these photos of dogs wearing fluttering false eyelashes can not be unseen recognise this ? one dog bears a striking resemblance to the ' @entity36 ' meme , based on @entity13 @entity37 barking mad : this pet looks as though it is taking its owner to task for equipping it with fake eyelashes some pet owners have gone even further than false lashes , with one giving what appears to be a @entity13 @entity37 a makeover with a silky neckerchief			1
the surprised dog bears an uncanny resemblance to the @entity36 - a surreal meme of an all - knowing dog surrounded by examples of terrible grammar in the font @entity50 it seems the craze has spread to cats , too , who look remarkably stern in their prosthetics			2
but several @entity62 users who tried to affix false lashes to their pets failed completely - when their accessories were mistaken for snacks			2
others were thwarted by less - than - co - operative dogs or snarling grumpy cats			0
woof woof : while some of the dogs look bizarre or unnerving , others are strangely suited to fake lashes here 's looking at you , kitt : the craze appears to have spread from dogs to cats			1
both look unfeasibly scary furry - ous : cats do n't take quite as well to fake eyelashes , it seems			0
this one looks terribly stern the craze is thought to have begun when @entity13 @entity62 user @ 30miomio3030 uploaded a picture of a lapdog with surprised - looking black eyelashes , which has been re-tweeted more than 10,000 times			0
the @entity17 blog , which highlighted the craze , wrote : ' right now , it 's not a huge thing by any stretch - yet			0
but , for better or worse , this does exist ! ' like most creatures , dogs do have lashes to keep grit and pollen our of their eyes , but they are often shorter or harder to notice than those on human beings .			0

photos of dogs wearing fake lashes emerged on a @entity13 culture blog
