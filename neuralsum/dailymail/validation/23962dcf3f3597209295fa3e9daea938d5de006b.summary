@entity0 believes he needs to wise up to recapture his edge after admitting he has fallen below the standards of his dazzling debut season			1
the @entity5 midfielder lit up @entity7 ’s first campaign in charge and was instrumental in helping his side reclaim a place in @entity11 ; his form was so good that he broke into @entity14 ’s squad and went to the @entity15 in @entity16			1
this time around , though , things have not been so straightforward			2
@entity0 began the campaign by damaging his medial ligaments and he has struggled to recapture his swagger , playing in unfamiliar roles out on the wing			1
@entity0 scored @entity5 's third goal against @entity24 during their 3 - 0 win on sunday @entity0 began the campaign by damaging his medial ligaments and has struggled for form but @entity0 looked sharper after he came on as a substitute in sunday ’s 3 - 0 win over @entity24 and he restored some confidence by scoring the final goal			1
he maintains the education has been beneficial and is determined to have a string finish to the campaign , starting in @entity33 on thursday			1
‘ it has been a tough season for me , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’m still learning and i am still a young lad			0
every game is different and because last year was my first full season in the @entity37 and then maybe no one really knew about me			2
‘ maybe this season they know part of my game and it is up to me to learn and adapt			2
if people think they know what i am going to do , i have to come up with something different and have other options			0
‘ our season has n’t been the best and everyone else is still learning , but hopefully this season will be a good experience for me			2
i know i have n’t been at my best but the gaffer will give us confidence in training saying he knows what we are capable of			0
‘ all the backroom staff and the more vocal lads in the team like @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 – all the older lads in the team , the most experienced ones , they help us because they have all been through similar experiences			0
listening to what they say helps			0

‘ i am always going to try and want the ball , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ that is the way i have been brought up through the academy			0
even if i make a mistake , i will keep wanting the ball because i know eventually things will click together and i will create chances and the goals will come			0
‘ i feel like this can be a turning point for me and the team			0
all the lads were buzzing , we got three points and you could see the crowd were happy as well			0
everyone is getting on with each other and we are looking forward to the games coming up , gathering some points and climbing up the table			2
’ before @entity5 ’s next @entity37 assignment against @entity105 , they can book a place in the @entity108 quarter - finals if they preserve the 2 - 1 advantage they secured against @entity111 last thursday			1
‘ we are going to approach it the way we approach every game , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we did well at home and hopefully now we can do that in the away game			0
we have to be positive and give our all			0
