by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:25 est , 5 december 2013 the bizarre six - sided storm churning @entity5 ’s north pole has been captured in unprecedented detail			1
the hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200 mph winds and spans 20,000 miles ( 30,000 kilometers ) across - more than twice the diameter of @entity11			1
scientists believe there is no weather feature like this anywhere else in the solar system			0
the footage captured by the @entity29 spacecraft is the first of its kind , using colour filters , to show a complete view of the top of @entity5			1
‘ a hurricane on @entity11 typically lasts a week , but this has been here for decades - and who knows - maybe centuries , ’ said @entity35 , at the @entity36 in @entity37			1
this animation above shows a view from directly over the north pole , keeping up with the rotation of the planet so that all the motion seen on the screen is the motion of the storms inside the hexagon			1
this older , colour composite image - showing false shades - has been created from raw images taken by @entity29 from a distance of 379,268 miles away the mysterious six - sided hexagon on @entity5 ’s @entity55 has long captivated astronomers is thought to be is nearly 20,000 miles ( 30,000 kilometers )			1
the hexagon is made of a band of upper - atmospheric winds which creates its six - sided shape			2
a polar cyclone can be seen at its centre			0
first seen by @entity63 1 and 2 over 30 years ago the hexagon it thought to be fixed with @entity5 ’s rotation			2
in april , the @entity29 spacecraft provided scientists with the first close - up , visible - light views of a behemoth hurricane swirling within the hexagon			2
thin , bright clouds at the outer edge of the hurricane were estimated to be travelling at around 330 mph ( 150 metres per second )			0
weather patterns on @entity11 are interrupted when they encounter friction from land forms			2
scientists suspect the stability of the hexagon has something to do with the lack of solid land forms on @entity5 , which is essentially a giant ball of gas			2
better views of the hexagon are available now because the sun began to illuminate its interior in late 2012			0
@entity29 captured images of the hexagon over a 10 - hour time span with high - resolution cameras , giving scientists a good look at the motion of cloud structures within			0
scientists saw the storm around the pole , as well as small vortices rotating in the opposite direction of the hexagon			0
some of the vortices are swept along with the jet stream as if on a racetrack			0
the largest of these vortices spans about 2,200 miles ( 3,500 km ) , or about twice the size of the largest hurricane recorded on @entity11			1
the footage captured by the @entity29 spacecraft is the first of its kind , using colour filters , to show a complete view of the top of @entity5 scientists analysed these images in false colour , a rendering method that made it easier to distinguish differences among the types of particles suspended in the atmosphere inside and outside the hexagon			2
‘ inside the hexagon , there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles , while outside the hexagon , the opposite is true , ’ said @entity123 , a @entity29 imaging team associate at @entity125 in @entity126			0
‘ the hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier , which results in something like @entity11 's @entity138 ozone hole			1
’ the @entity138 ozone hole forms within a region enclosed by a jet stream with similarities to the hexagon			0
wintertime conditions enable ozone - destroying chemical processes to occur and the jet stream prevents a resupply of ozone from the outside			0
at @entity5 , large aerosols can not cross into the hexagonal jet stream from outside and large aerosol particles are created when sunlight shines on the atmosphere			0
only recently , with the start of @entity5 's northern spring in august 2009 , did sunlight begin bathing the planet 's northern hemisphere			1
‘ as we approach @entity5 's summer solstice in 2017 , lighting conditions over its north pole will improve , and we are excited to track the changes that occur both inside and outside the hexagon boundary , ’ said @entity156 , @entity29 deputy project scientist			1
this spectacular , vertigo inducing , false - colour image from @entity167 's @entity29 mission highlights the storms at @entity5 's north pole			1
the mysterious six - sided hexagon is thought to be is nearly 20,000 miles ( 30,000 km )			0

footage shows storm on @entity5 's north pole raging with winds of 200mph
largest wind system is 2,200 miles wide - this is twice the size of largest hurricane ever recorded on @entity11
‘ a hurricane on @entity11 typically lasts a week , but this has been here for decades - and who knows - maybe centuries , ’ said @entity167 's @entity35
