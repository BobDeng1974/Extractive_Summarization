the former home secretary said it was unfair for people in @entity12 and the @entity13 to inherit a fortune from their parents simply because of the soaring property market in and around the capital			2
mr @entity0 said the previous @entity1 government 's proposed ' death tax ' to pay for care in old age had ' a lot of merit ' and should be revisited			1

' ' let me be really controversial : why should their sons and daughters or nephews and nieces win the lottery when they die ? ' because that 's what it amounts to compared with people in the rented sector and particularly in low terraced housing , even if they own it , in the @entity55 and @entity56			0
