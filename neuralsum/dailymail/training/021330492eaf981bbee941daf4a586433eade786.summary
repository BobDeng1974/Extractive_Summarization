exclusive by @entity1 planes are involved in potential safety breaches in @entity6 airspace every three days , new figures have revealed			2
since 2010 , 438 commerical and private flights over @entity6 have been flagged up to the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) because they have flown too close together			1
the worrying statistics come after it was revealed that 361 @entity12 planes have been involved in near misses in the last 16 years			2
@entity15 officials had pledged to install new safety equipment in 1998 , but never did			0
since 2010 , 438 commerical and private flights over @entity6 have prompted safety investigations because they have flown too close together if there is a reduction in the space between aircraft during a flight , the incident is required to be reported to the @entity8 under the @entity25 ( @entity26 ) scheme			1
if a pilot or air traffic controller feel that safety may have been compromised at any time , the authorities are also alerted			1
these conflicts are referred to as @entity32 and are investigated by a specialist team that analyses data such as recorded radar and voice communications			2
a serious breach in safety occurred last year when two jumbo jets with around 1,000 people on board were just 100ft from crashing over @entity41 , because pilots confused their flight instructions			0
the two @entity45 747s were 30 miles north of @entity46 and preparing to cross the @entity47 when an air traffic controller spotted they were moving closer together			0
last month an airliner that was coming in to land had a near miss in mid-air with a motorised parachutist at 2,000ft about the ground			0
when air space is reduced between two aircraft over @entity6 airspace , it is reported to the @entity8 the @entity60 missed the flying - machine by only 150ft , causing the pilot to see the parachute canopy flash by the cockpit of the plane			1
in 1948 , 39 passengers died when two planes crashed mid-air over @entity69 near @entity70			0
a @entity8 spokesperson said : ' an @entity32 is a situation in which , in the opinion of a pilot or a controller , the distance between aircraft as well as their relative positions and speed have been such that the safety of the aircraft involved may have been compromised			1
' the majority of airproxes do not involve airliners and serious airprox incidents involving airliners are extremely rare			0
' for example , there have only been two " category a " incidents - where there is a serious risk of collision â€“ since 2005			0
' nevertheless , any incidents that do occur are thoroughly assessed by independent investigators and a panel of safety experts			1
' any lessons that can be learnt are acted on and shared across the aviation industry			2

since 2010 , 438 *commercial* and private *journeys* probed by authorities
aircraft are *subjected* to set of lateral and vertical *arrangements*
distances *approved* by @entity32 , an independent panel of aviation experts
if these are compromised , they are reported to the @entity8
