labour mps are said to be hatching a secret plot to stop the party brokering a coalition with @entity5 's @entity4 @entity0 are hatching secret plans to wreck any deal with the @entity8 by holding an emergency summit after the election			1
a meeting of the entire @entity12 ( @entity12 ) would be convened in order to veto any attempt by mr @entity15 to win @entity16 by brokering a deal with @entity5 ’s @entity4			1
@entity0 say the possibility of forming an alliance with a party which wants to break up the @entity21 is already alienating many of their core voters on both sides of the border			1
@entity26 , chairman of the @entity12 , is understood to have told mr @entity15 ’s aides that his mps will not tolerate a repeat of the situation after the 2010 election , when @entity32 tried to stay in power by striking a deal with @entity35 , but without consulting his party			1
mr @entity15 publicly insists his only concern is to achieve an outright @entity39 majority			1
but plans are being made by senior @entity0 , subject to security arrangements , for the @entity12 to meet inside the @entity42 on sunday , may 10 – three days after the election – if there is a hung @entity45			2
a weekend meeting is highly unusual , but it would be the only chance for mps to gather after all of the constituencies have declared , but before the start of negotiations to form a new government			0
as the polls stand , @entity39 will not win enough seats to form an administration , and its only option might be to try to stitch together a three - way ‘ grand coalition ’ with the nationalists and @entity60			2
the @entity4 – which currently has just six @entity62 seats out of a total of 59 in @entity64 – is on course to win as many as 56 , mainly at @entity39 ’s expense			2
although mr @entity15 insisted on friday that talk of an agreement with the @entity4 was ‘ a piece of nonsense ’ , he has stopped short of ruling it out			2
last night , @entity39 mp @entity73 demanded that the leader listen to his party			0
‘ i do not think there is any way that the @entity12 would support a pact with the @entity4 because it would do such long - term damage to the party ’s electability , ’ he said			0
‘ we need to slam the door on a deal with the nationalists			0
it is not just harming our vote in @entity64 – the prospect of an alliance with a party which wants to break up the @entity21 is also hitting our prospects south of the border			0
’ @entity15 insisted that talk of an agreement with the @entity4 was ' nonsense ' but stopped short of ruling it out @entity39 ’s former home secretary , @entity96 , said on thursday he did not know why his party had not ruled out a pact , adding that it ‘ could n’t possibly do a deal with a party that wants to be out of the @entity21 and give up our nuclear deterrent ’			1
labour nerves have been rattled by the successful launch of a new @entity105 campaign poster , which shows a miniature @entity15 in the top pocket of former @entity4 leader @entity108 , who is expected to win a @entity62 seat			1
one labour mp told @entity111 : ‘ we will not tolerate coalition negotiations taking place above [ our ] heads again , and certainly not if it means getting into bed with the @entity4 ... this has been accepted in principle by @entity15 ’s office			1
’ a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ our focus is on one thing and one thing only : a majority			0
we do n’t need , do n’t want and are not planning for a coalition			0
’ mr @entity26 was not available for comment .			0
