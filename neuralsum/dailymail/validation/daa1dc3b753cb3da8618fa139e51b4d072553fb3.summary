@entity0 insisted that @entity1 can defy history and overturn a two - goal deficit to knock out @entity4 at the @entity5 on tuesday night			1
no team has ever lost by two goals in the home leg and gone on to win the tie in the @entity11 era			1
but @entity0 insisted that @entity1 were capable of producing the mother of all comebacks against the club he managed for seven years of his career , from 1987 - 1994			1
@entity0 was in bullish mood ahead of @entity11 showdown in @entity4 @entity1 boss @entity0 walks on the pitch at the @entity5 on monday night @entity1 stars appeared relaxed as they headed to @entity21 on monday for their @entity11 tie @entity0 said : ‘ it does n’t matter that the statistics are against us , the result is against us			1
we ’re conscious of that			2
but no matter how big percentage is against us , we have to give everything to make the statistics lie and that ’s our belief : that we can do it			2
‘ we ’re here for that			0
@entity4 are in very strong position			1
we have experience , we have the desire and we have the belief that we can do it			0
you can expect us to show different side to miss. ' we totally missed the first leg , which was pretty surprising as we ’ve won 12 of our last 14			2
of course we did n’t play well but in life , if you miss a chance , sometimes you do n’t have a second chance			0
but here we have a second chance			0
’ @entity47 ( left ) and @entity48 prepare to board @entity1 's flight to @entity21 on monday afternoon @entity1 star @entity50 poses for the cameras before boarding the flight from @entity53 @entity0 may have to gamble on attack in the last - 16 tie on tuesday but he admitted he was not a regular at the world - famous casino in the principality			1
‘ i did n’t visit the casino when i was here , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ as in @entity61 , i stayed a lot on football pitches			0
i do n’t think people saw me there ‘ we need to perform well tomorrow and have a great performance			0
before the game what we want is to give everything			0
if we did n’t believe , we would n’t be here			0
‘ ideally you want score early but i believe we have to play with full power but not forget organisation and structure in the team and when the goal comes , the goal will come			1
no - one can predict when that will be			2
@entity78 ( right ) believes it will be ' very important ' that @entity1 score an early goal against @entity4 keeper @entity81 ( centre ) may have to settle for a place on the bench on tuesday night ' football is not predictable but i can predict that desire and belief will be there			1
we ’re in the @entity11 last 16 and anything can happen on a positive front as long as we believe we can do it			0
’ @entity0 does have concerns about the pitch at the @entity5 , with @entity4 engulfed by rain showers at present			1
‘ it is a little bit of a problem if it rains a lot , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ there were two problems when i was manager and one was that the pitch quality was not fantastic			0
' but i just went out on the pitch and it ’s good very good			0
and the second problem was when it rains in south of @entity21 , it really rains			2
they ’ve had to postpone a match here recently – but that forecast is not for heavy rain			0
