in recent years the search for life beyond our planet has focused on finding places with conditions that are ‘ @entity9 - like ’ , so as to emulate our own planet , which we know can support life			2
however , scientists have now proposed that some worlds might be able to host life ‘ not as we know it ’ that thrives not on water , but on other chemicals			1
specifically , they looked at @entity15 , which has seas of liquid methane rather than water , and they it could harbour methane - based , oxygen - free forms of life			1
@entity23 scientists in @entity24 have proposed a new type of life			1
called an azotosome , it would survive on liquid methane rather than water - so it could live on @entity15			1
shown is an illustration of a nine - nanometre azotosome , the size of a virus , with a piece of the membrane cut away to show the hollow interior the fascinating research by scientists at @entity23 in @entity24 suggests that life in the universe may be abundant in more places than thought			1
the life they propose , called an azotosome , would be composed of small organic nitrogen compounds and be capable of functioning in liquid methane temperatures of -180 ° @entity49 )			1
no life on @entity9 is known to be able to survive in similar conditions			2
‘ ours is the first concrete blueprint of life not as we know it , ’ said graduate student @entity52 , first author of the research			1
life on our planet relies on a permeable water - based exterior - a vesicle or liposome - that houses the organic matter of every cell			2
as no life on @entity9 can survive without water , astronomers have been looking for alien life in habitable zones of stars where liquid water can exist - it is not too hot , and not too cold			2
but if cells could be based on methane , rather than water , they could survive in much colder climates , as methane has a much lower melting point			2
a study in november 2014 argued that alien species could exist on planets that contain an exotic substance known as ' supercritical ' carbon dioxide , rather than water			0
this type of @entity85 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds , creating a supercritical fluid that has features of both a liquid and gas			0
carbon dioxide becomes supercritical when its temperature exceeds 305 degrees @entity95 ( 32 ° c ) and its pressure goes beyond 72.9 the standard atmosphere at sea level			0
on @entity9 , it 's increasingly used in application such as dry cleaning or to sterilise medical equipment , but astrobiologists at @entity104 believe it could also be capable of sustaining life			0
study co-author professor @entity107 and his team compared enzymes in carbon dioxide and in water , and found that they were more stable in supercritical co2			0
the life proposed by the scientists would be composed of small organic nitrogen compounds and be capable of functioning in liquid methane temperatures of -180 ° @entity49 )			1
this means it could survive on the surface of @entity15 ( illustration shown ) , meaning more worlds might be habitable than we thought the theoretical azotosome life form is made from nitrogen , carbon and hydrogen molecules - all of which are known to exist in the cryogenic seas of @entity15			1
however , it shows the same stability and flexibility as comparable life on @entity9			0
and interestingly , to create the structures , the scientists also envision the cells could use a compound called acrylonitrile , which is a strong barrier to decomposition			0
@entity140 is a colourless , poisonous , liquid organic compound use in the manufacture of acrylic fibres and thermoplastics on @entity9 - and it is also present in @entity15 ’s atmosphere			0
chemical engineer dr @entity147 said the the next step is to try and demonstrate how these cells would behave in the methane environment			0
this includes how they might reproduce and metabolise with their oxygen - free , methane - based cells			0

@entity23 scientists in @entity24 have proposed a new type of life
called an azotosome it would survive on liquid methane rather than water
this means it could live on the surface of @entity158 's @entity175
and it may also mean more places are habitable than we thought
it 's the first proof for ' life not as we know it , ’ said student @entity52
