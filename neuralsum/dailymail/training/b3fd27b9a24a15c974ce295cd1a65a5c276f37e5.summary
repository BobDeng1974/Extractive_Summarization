@entity0 is best remembered for saving a penalty during @entity4 's famous 1988 @entity3 final victory over @entity5 - yet he was named on the bench for @entity7 a whole 26 years later			1
the 55 - year - old , capped twice by @entity9 , was promoted to the substitutes ' bench for @entity7 's trip to @entity13 to take on @entity14 in @entity15			1
and if he had made an appearance , @entity0 - who is @entity7 's goalkeeping coach but was rushed on to the bench as @entity21 's back - up after his 26 - year - old son @entity22 was injured - would have become the oldest professional footballer in @entity9 history			1
