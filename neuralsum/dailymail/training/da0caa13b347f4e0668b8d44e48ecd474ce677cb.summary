by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has not only reached the second week of the @entity3 , he is also likely to have seen the back of the @entity5 , where he rarely fails to flirt with danger			1
the 2012 champion will hope to be back on the main @entity9 for the rest of the event after nearly allowing a mini crisis to become another drama on @entity15 ' more disheveled secondary arena			2
having started beautifully he suddenly had all the positive energy drain from him in the third set before beating the free hitting @entity19 @entity18 6 - 1 , 7 - 5 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 2 in two hours and 36 minutes			1
these seems little point in looking beyond that to a possible quarter final with @entity21 , who is looking ominously good after faltering badly in his two post-wimbledon tournaments , and has reached the last sixteen for the loss of just eighteen games			1
the @entity51 's performance was a football - style game of two halves that saw him unexpectedly lapse into some bad @entity57 habits in the third set marked by poor body language and outbursts against himself			1
his new coach @entity62 will try and cajole him out of that , and her influence may have been behind his high count of well - judged forays to the net			2
yet it was his traditionally outstanding returning skills that decided a match against a frustrating opponent who enjoyed several hot streaks			2
@entity2 managed to break serve eight times in all , ruthlessly exploiting the relatively weak @entity18 serve			1
there are unlikely to be such pickings on offer in the next round			2
ultimately he survived another visit to an arena he finds tricky , where early in the fourth set he complained about the dangerous proximity of a television camera at the back of the tight arena			0
' i was n't cross , just making the point that i nearly ran straight into the camera with my knee , ' he said			0
' obviously i 've had a couple of bad experiences there			0
last monday was not a great experience			2
that 's hard to put out of your mind			0
' on this court the wind swirls around a lot			0
sometimes you can play four games in a row into the wind because it changes so often			0
also it 's a very tight there 's not much runback compared with @entity108			0
' today the match could have been a bit quicker if i got that breakpoint at 4 - all in the third set			1
but each time i had a slip , i did a decent job of getting myself back into the sets , getting a break straightaway			0
' love game : @entity2 was watched by his girlfriend @entity120 ( left ) from the stands different class : @entity123 96 @entity18 could not keep pace with the former @entity3 champion support act : @entity2 was cheered on throughout the match by four fans wearing his name on their vests from the off the 27 year - old @entity51 looked a lot sharper than he did in the first round , as he tries to gain the full momentum that has been elusive this year , with the run at the @entity135 into the semi-finals the nearest he has come to finding it			1
a second break made it a comfortable first set and all his vital signs were in good working order , with impressive movement and the backhand being manoeuvred with its old metronomic efficiency			0
he was also getting plenty of free points in his last two meetings with the swinging serve into the deuce court			0
the close to ideal mix of defence and attack that he constantly seeks continued with an early break in the second , which was wiped out by a sudden streak of winners from the @entity19 which brought him back level			0
only at 5 - 5 did @entity2 reassert his superiority , again crunching away the short second serves of @entity18 to break handsomely and then serve it out minus any dramas , concluding with a loud ' come on ! ' @entity165 : the @entity166 remains on course to face no 1 seed @entity21 in the quarter finals loss of concentration : @entity2 grimaces after losing a closely contested fourth set that should really have sealed matters , only for the number eight seed to lapse as he is wont to do in a way you rarely see from the likes of @entity21 or @entity178 when they are really firing			1
the positive energy suddenly seeped from @entity2 as @entity18 upped his level and , letting out a tirade of abuse at himself and allowing his body language to sag , he played a poor game against the highly mobile @entity19 to be broken for 3 - 1 , capping with a double fault			1
fortunately he was again able to pull level thanks largely to his ability to punish anything short on the second serve , but it is one of his mysteries how he sometimes manage to tune out of a match without any warning and get so frustrated			0
having restored order and missed two break points at 4 - 4 , one of them lost to flukey net cord , he threw in another poor game to lose the set with a double fault			1
after taking the dreaded toilet break to compose himself he came out and trampled all over the @entity19 's serve to get over the line			0
he and @entity26 have a long rivalry with @entity2 normally coming out on top when it matters			1
monday represents an opportunity , albeit a challenging one , to set himself up for the hardest task of all , the rejuvenated @entity21			2
girl power : @entity2 's coach @entity62 watches her charge from the players ' box court in the act : a general view of @entity222 court at @entity15 in @entity33 lying in wait : @entity21 could meet @entity2 in the last eight after beating @entity225 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 it 's not too late to play @entity227 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there 's £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week …			1
