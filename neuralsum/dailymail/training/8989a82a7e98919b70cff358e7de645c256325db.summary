by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale the highly divisive nature of @entity4 chairman @entity3 ’s @entity2 was demonstrated by the answer an @entity4 councillor received when asking about the conspicuous lack of schools football in the report			1
@entity10 , a former @entity11 consulting executive who has led @entity3 ’s research team , told @entity13 , the @entity4 representative , after a @entity15 presentation : ‘ i did not know they still played football in schools			1
’ this infuriated @entity13 , especially as schools football is seen by many as an area that should have been investigated by @entity3 ’s commission			1
finger pointing : there were surprising omissions from @entity3 's @entity2 proposals , including schools football another strange omission in the report was any mention of the proposed north - south regionalisation of lower - league football that had been championed by @entity32 during @entity2 meetings			1
it is understood that was pulled from the final , hastily - put - together report at the last moment , despite forming part of the original draft			0
the most bizarre aspect of the @entity15 briefing was that @entity3 chose to have @entity43 full back @entity41 , the surprise choice on the @entity2 panel , to his right			1
@entity3 had difficulty getting a word in edgeways , so often did @entity50 and his fellow panellist , former @entity53 manager @entity52 , hijack questions aimed only at @entity3			2
chatty pair : @entity56 ( left ) and @entity41 ( centre ) interrupted @entity3 often in the press conference @entity53 ' former managing director @entity59 was interviewed by @entity60 on thursday over the installation of spy cameras within @entity63 following complaints made by new owner @entity65 alleging misuse of club funds for the purchase of the equipment			1
@entity59 said in a statement that surveillance devices were quite properly paid for by the club and were put in place following reports to him alleging the use of @entity78 drugs within the club			2
however , the police are only looking into the alleged misuse of funds rather than any perceived drugs culture at the troubled club			0
the @entity4 ’s search for a £ 9million - a - year @entity87 sponsor to replace @entity88 next season may end with the @entity91 - owned household appliance giants @entity92 stepping up from their lower - tier supply deal			0
@entity92 have the financial power for a big football partnership , although their sports sponsorships focus on basketball			0
clubs ’ £ 50m vat bill the @entity101 are understood to have negotiated for around 15 of their clubs to pay a total of £ 50million in tax to settle a vat dispute			1
it concerns agents who exploited a grey area in the regulations by claiming they represented clubs rather than players , who never want any avoidable extra tax landing on their bill			0
the vast payments emerged during a court case involving agent @entity117 , who is suing @entity118 and others for being cut out of the £ 1m @entity121 transfer from @entity122 to @entity118 in 2007			0
@entity118 chairman @entity123 told the court his club had paid £ 1.8m to settle their dual representation issue , which was a ‘ relatively small amount compared to others ’			2
it is believed @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 sorted out their tax affairs without @entity101 assistance			0
bombshell : @entity59 , @entity53 ' former managing director was interviewed by @entity60 following complaints from @entity65 ( below ) over the installation of spy cameras within @entity63 the @entity139 autobiography due out in august must be causing publishers @entity141 plenty of angst judging by the extraordinary reaction of commissioning editor @entity144 to a harmless enquiry about the date of publication			1
@entity144 , who is in charge of the @entity139 project , put the phone down while shouting ‘ scum ’			0
when asked later about this offensive attitude to newspapers , he said : ‘ i apologise but i was angry about having to answer so many questions about the book			0
’ it will only add to hostilities between the @entity101 and the @entity4 that @entity3 chose to rush out his recommendations on a day when @entity101 chief executive @entity159 was due to hold media interviews about sunday ’s climax to the season			2
the @entity101 claim their under 21 league , panned by @entity3 in his report , offers a better technical challenge for young players than the @entity4 proposals			1
and top - flight insiders compared him picking off individual clubs for support rather than the @entity101 collective to his predecessor @entity172 ’s tactics when he took on the @entity101 over debt			2
off the record : @entity139 's autobiography must be causing publishers ' @entity141 plenty of problems			0

schools football was strange omission from @entity3 's @entity2 propsal
@entity59 interviewed over installation of spy cameras at @entity53
@entity101 negotiate for 15 clubs to pay £ 50m to settle @entity190 dispute
@entity101 claim under 21 league offers better technical *advantages* than b teams
