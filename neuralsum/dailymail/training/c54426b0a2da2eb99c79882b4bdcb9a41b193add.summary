by @entity0 concept images of @entity4 's @entity3 headquarters only reveal one part of a story which began in 2011 when co-founder @entity7 laid down plans for a futuristic new campus			1
during an interview with @entity12 , chief architect sir @entity10 gave an additional insight into how @entity4 's ' spaceship ' will be built - as well as the inspiration behind its circular and ' organic ' design			1
this includes cars being ' banished and buried ' in underground car parks , tarmac being replaced by greenery and windows that stretch the full height of the four - storey main building that slide open			1
work is expected to be completed in 2016 he also revealed that there will be room for 1,000 bikes and the tricks he is using to make the giant campus seem compact			1
' it 's interesting how it evolved , ' explained @entity10			0
' first of all , there was a smaller site			0
then , as the project developed , and the @entity51 site became available , the scale of the project changed			0
the reference point for @entity7 [ @entity53 ] was always the large space on the @entity56 campus - the @entity57 - which @entity7 knew intimately			2
he would reminisce about the time when he was young , and @entity59 was still the fruit bowl of the @entity61			0
' with this in mind , @entity10 said he wanted to add a series of ' organic segments ' to the @entity3 building - nicknamed the @entity4 spaceship because of its vast circular shape that covers 175 - acre and features a man - made forest of more than 7,000 trees			1
he also wanted the circular building to surround a private space in the centre , designed to replicate the @entity59 landscape , and mimic the orchards that @entity7 remembered fondly			1
as a result , @entity10 told @entity12 : ' the car would visually be banished , and tarmac would be replaced by greenery , and car parks by jogging and bicycle trails			1
' the ring - shaped structure was @entity7 ’ brainchild , yet after his death @entity87 designer @entity86 took the project on with the help of sir @entity10 , and the local council approved their ambitious plans last year			1
@entity10 said he wanted to add a series of ' organic segments ' to the @entity3 building because co-founder @entity7 wanted the circular building to surround a private space in the centre , designed to replicate the @entity59 landscape , and mimic the orchards that @entity7 remembered fondly as a child			1
the plans feature underground parking hidden from view , illustration pictured			2
sir @entity10 told @entity12 : ' the car would visually be banished , and tarmac would be replaced by greenery ' during his initial proposals , @entity4 's co-founder @entity7 said he wanted the building to be covered in 40ft floor - to - ceiling panes of curved glass so that all of the building 's four storeys would be visible from the outside and offer a large amount of natural light , pictured			1
sir @entity10 said these glass panels ' can literally move sideways and just open up into the landscape ' to make the building seem more open this room - sized mock - up of the planned new @entity4 headquarters in @entity3 was released in november last year before executives submitted their final plans to the council @entity4 's @entity128 was designed by sir @entity10 , pictured , and his firm @entity129			1
the architectural experts also designed @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 when @entity7 first submitted the plans back in 2011 the campus was billed as ' the best office building in the world '			1
it has taken since then to get approval from the local council and its likely the campus wo n't be completed until 2016			2
reports in april 2013 claimed the project had already exceeded its budget by around $ 2 billion ( £ 1.32bn ) , pushing the total cost up to around $ 5 billion ( £ 3.14 billion ) and putting it a year behind schedule			0
earlier this year @entity4 was asked to submit new plans with updated landscaping designed , a slightly revised floor layout , renderings , and a bicycle plan , however the overall main design was n't changed			2
under these updated plans , the campus was renamed @entity155 2			0
appearing as a giant saucer , the @entity157 site near the @entity158 will be home to 13,000 @entity4 employees			0
when asked how these employees will make their way around the huge campus , sir @entity10 said : ' the proximity , the adjacencies are very , very carefully considered			1
' remember also that the scale is broken down by cafes and lobbies and entrances			0
you have four - storey - high glass walls , which can literally move sideways and just open up into the landscape			1
so the social facilities break down the scale			0
' sir @entity10 added there will also be jogging and cycling trails , with more than a thousand bikes kept on site at all times , which staff can use to make their way around			1
the spaceship will have 360 - degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000 - seater auditorium , a gym and 300,000 square feet of ' research ' space			1
@entity155 2 will additionally have underground parking hidden from view , meaning 80 per cent of the site can be covered in trees			0
the site was previously owned by @entity51 and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt			0
the new images also show access roads that lead into tunnels that take cars into the underground car park			1
they also show the parts of the car park that will be on show pictured covered in plants and greenery to help it blend in with the natural surroundings			1
this image shows the @entity155 2 from above			0
the site will be surrounded by a man - made forest featuring 7,000 trees			1
it was previously owned by @entity51 and is currently covered in around 80 per cent asphalt among the 7,000 trees that will be planted around the campus , the firm intends to plant species that blossom at different times of the year			1
this includes apple trees , as well as cherry blossoms , plum trees and other fruit trees and bushes similar to the ones pictured inside the third - of - a - mile wide building will be 1,000 - seater auditorium where @entity4 's ceo @entity232 will present the company 's keynotes ahead of product launches , for example			1
this auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion , pictured , that will also be an access point for employees and guests elsewhere underground , the auditorium will be where @entity4 's ceo @entity232 will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches , for example			1
this auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests			0
natural gas will , primarily , provide the building 's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies			0
the glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels			2
‘ you see the energy and the love and the attention to detail that we 've put into this , ’ said @entity4 cfo @entity254 at an unveiling of the top secret spaceship plans			2
‘ we have treated this project just as we would any @entity4 product			0
and this will be a place for the most creative and collaborative teams in the industry to innovate for decades to come			0
’ the circular , four - storey building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the @entity274 as a ‘ massive glass doughnut ’			1
the building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air - conditioning for 70 per cent of the year , low energy led lighting where natural light does n’t reach , and on - site recycling			0
much of the inside of the futuristic building will also be made of glass with stone - coloured walls to add to the building 's natural - looking design , pictured			2
the 175 - acre @entity157 site near the 280 highway will house 13,000 staff not all of the parking spaces will be hidden			2
the parts of the multi-storey car park that will be on show , according to this latest image from @entity4 , will be covered in plants and greenery to help the concrete structure blend in ‘ this will be one of the most environmentally sustainable developments on this scale anywhere in the world , ' ’ said @entity4 ’s @entity300			1
in the centre will be an enclosed arboretum and orchard complete with thousands of fruit , oak , and olive trees according to the @entity312			0
‘ we love @entity59 , and by adding over 2,500 new and indigenous trees that truly belong here , ’ @entity254 said , ‘ we 're bringing back the beautiful orchards that once made up this valley			2
’ campus 2 was designed by sir @entity10 's firm @entity129			1
the architectural experts also designed @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
' the concept of the building , ' @entity254 said , ' is collaboration and fluidity			0
it 'll provide a very open - spaced system , so that at one point in the day you may be in offices on one side of the circle and find yourself on the other side later that day			0
' @entity4 has also factored in a 90,000 - square - foot cafeteria , part of which is pictured			0
it will cover at least two storeys of the predominantly glass building and will feature oak tables and chairs the cafeteria will also feature an outside dining and picnic area , pictured			2
@entity4 's @entity128 additionally comes with a fitness centre in the northern part of the building @entity4 ’s current office building at 1 @entity346 will remain and the new offices down the road will be built in addition to the current offices , which house around 2,600 workers			2
when @entity7 first presented the plans in 2011 , he said his firm was ' growing like a weed			2
’ ' we do have a shot at building the best office building in the world , ’ he said			0
‘ i really do think architecture students will come here to see this			0
' employees will additionally be given a 90,000 - square - foot cafeteria that connects to an outside dining and picnic area			0
this will be a short work from the fitness centre in the north of the building .			0
