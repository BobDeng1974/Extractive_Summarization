by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 21 november 2013 @entity2 : 18:38 est , 21 november 2013 when @entity4 dreamed up @entity5 and his amazing , impossible sweets in the 1960s , he enthralled children of that generation , and in generations to come			0
but while anybody who read @entity13 - or saw the acclaimed 1971 film - will know the products came from a world of ' pure imagination ' , scientists have come close to making one @entity5 - style treat a reality			0
researchers at the @entity20 have created a ' digital lollipop ' , which uses electric currents to transmit virtual tastes straight to your tastebuds			1
the 1971 film adaptation is pictured pure imagination : the device has attributes of the fictional @entity38 and @entity39 the device has echoes of the fictional @entity38 , which never runs out , and the @entity39 , which had several different flavours packed into one piece of gum			1
all of the four major taste groups - sweet , salty , bitter and sour - can be mimicked through a silver electrode which makes contact with the tongue			1
the gadget also makes tiny adjustments in temperature to simulate tastes more convincingly			0
@entity53 , who led the research , told the @entity56 magazine : ' we have found noninvasive electrical and thermal stimulation of the tip of the tongue successfully generates the primary taste sensations '			0
the invention is relatively crude at the moment , but there are hopes to make it small enough that users can almost wholly close their mouth while using it			2
sensational : another tester uses the device , which can also mimic changes in temperature for a more authentic taste control panel : the invention can mimic sweet , sour , bitter and salty flavours there are also plans to make the simulation more precise by simulating the smell and texture of real food , which are important parts of how we taste			1
although at the moment the invention is little more than a novelty experience , ms @entity53 says the lollipop could one day have medical uses			2
she said : ' people with diabetes might be able to use the taste synthesiser to simulate sweet sensations without harming their actual blood sugar levels			1
cancer patients could use it to improve or regenerate a diminished sense of taste during chemotherapy			0
' the same team is also in the early stages of developing a way to transmit tastes from one device to another , in the hope that one day people will be able to ' taste message ' as easily as email or text .			0

' @entity112 ' device can transmit flavours *electronically*
it can simulate sweet , salty , bitter and sour sensations
there are hopes the invention could have medical uses
it was developed by researchers at the @entity20
