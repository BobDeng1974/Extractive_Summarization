the images of @entity2 cities left smouldering and in ruins at the end of the @entity6 have been starkly echoed in new pictures revealing wholesale devastation across eastern @entity9			1
heavily shelled tower blocks , abandoned hotels and airplane noses that look to have dropped from the sky are among the sights depicting the destruction in @entity16 , which in parts equals that seen after the @entity6 in cities such as @entity20 and @entity21			1
it comes as heavy weaponry was today towed away from the front line at the village of @entity26 , north of the government stronghold of @entity28 , in a move that signified a @entity31 and @entity32 - brokered ceasefire may be beginning to take hold 11 days after it was agreed			1
the @entity76 rebels , who committed to the truce after their successful offensive , have been pulling back heavy weapons for two days , but @entity66 had until now held back from implementing the withdrawal , arguing that fighting had not yet ceased			2
however , the army today reported no combat fatalities at the front for a second straight day - the first time no troops have been killed since long before the @entity31 and @entity32 - brokered truce was meant to take effect			1
the withdrawal of artillery is ' point two ' of the peace agreement reached in the @entity93 capital @entity94 , so it amounts to an acknowledgement that ' point one ' - the ceasefire itself - is being observed			1
' today @entity9 has begun the withdrawal of 100 millimetre guns from the line of confrontation , ' the military said in a statement , saying the step would be monitored by the @entity106			1
it said it reserved the right to alter the schedule of withdrawal ' in the event of any attempted offensive '			0
@entity114 trees and a bullet ridden stop sign are all that is left standing in a section of @entity16 airport a partially destroyed church remains standing despite the obvious damage it has received during months of warfare one of the main buildings of @entity16 airport is left in ruins after troops withdraw from the bitterly disputed area @entity9 troops and rebel forces both began withdrawing artillery from the frontline today in a sign the peace plan may be taking hold			1
pictured is the battle worn @entity16 airport the roof of this abandoned administrative building in @entity16 was completley destroyed during the heavy bombing a gutted bus sits in the @entity139 between the towns of @entity141 and @entity28 in eastern @entity9 a part of the airport passengers once used to board flights is left a wreck , with only the frame of the building remaining upright a rebel soldier wanders through part of @entity16 airport as artillery began withdrawing from the area a rebel walks through the remains of the airport amid reports both sides have begun withdrawing artillery from the frontline rebel soldiers force @entity9 prisoners of war to search through the wreckage of @entity16 airport to remove dead bodies and weaponry the airport has been left in ruins , with collapsed roofs and walls burying soldiers after months of shelling and fighting witnesses in rebel - held @entity16 said they had heard no artillery in the night although the occasional distant blast or gunshot could be heard during the day			1
rebels brought @entity9 war prisoners to the ruins of the airport on the north of the town to recover the dead bodies of their fellow @entity9 troops , left buried in the wreckage since the terminal was captured in january			1
rebels also carried out controlled explosions to blast holes through walls inside the ruined terminal and sent the prisoners down a ladder where the floor had collapsed			0
three dead bodies still lay at the site out of five that had been recovered from the debris yesterday			0
prisoners said they were searching for three more they believed were still buried			0
the commander of the separatist ' @entity202 ' battalion , going by the @entity204 ' , said the prisoners had been assigned the task because ' it 's not our job to recover dead bodies , it 's our job to make them			0
' they take their comrades out to return them to their mums and dads			0
did they think we would feed them for free ? ' airplane noses sit partially damaged near @entity16 airport			1
the site has been one of the most heavily fought over pieces of land damage : a commercial aircraft lies destroyed at the region 's airport , which came under heavy bombardment during months of fighting bullet - ridden : a destroyed commercial airplanes sit scattered at the airport , revealing the extent of damage caused by months of fighting shells : burnt out vehicles lie strewn next to a destroyed building in @entity232 village , in the eastern @entity16 region obliterated : an armed soldier of the separatist self - proclaimed @entity236 army stands inside the damaged @entity16 airport rubble : a pro-russian rebel stands guard while @entity9 prisoners of war are forced to search through the wreckage a flimsy building remains standing but covered in shelling damage and bullet holes amid the rubble of @entity16 the twisted remains of a tank lie near @entity16 airport			1
on the left is its base , while metres to the right sits the turret the battle of @entity20 ( pictured ) , which took place during the @entity6 , was a prolonged and entrenched battle which left much of the @entity257 city in ruins @entity16 airport has been a totemic battlefield for both sides			1
@entity9 troops had held out there for months until the rebels assaulted it after abandoning a previous ceasefire agreed in september			1
the separatist rebels initially ignored the new truce last week to launch an advance that led to one of the biggest battles of a war that has killed more than 5,600 people			0
but since capturing the strategic town of @entity141 , where the rebels said the truce did not apply , they have taken pains to emphasise that they now intend to abide by it			0
western countries denounced the rebels and their presumed sponsor , @entity257 president @entity282 , for advancing on @entity141 after the truce was meant to take effect			0
but they have since held out hope that the ceasefire will now hold , with the rebels having achieved that objective			2
in the days after its troops were driven from @entity141 , @entity66 maintained that it believed the rebels were reinforcing for another advance , particularly expressing fear for the city of @entity294 , a port of 500,000 people			2
western countries have threatened to impose new economic sanctions on @entity298 if the rebels advance further into territory the @entity301 '			0
@entity298 , which denies aiding its sympathisers in @entity9 , said today the threats of more sanctions were cover for @entity306 efforts to undermine the truce			2
' it 's an attempt to ... distract attention from the necessity to fulfil the conditions of the @entity94 agreements , ' foreign minister @entity308 said			0
@entity282 and his @entity315 counterpart @entity314 signed an agreement to give @entity257 military ships access to @entity315 ports			0
ties between @entity301 and the @entity320 have plummeted in the wake of the @entity9 crisis , but @entity282 said the ships allowed to dock at @entity315 ports would mostly be used in international anti-terrorism and piracy efforts			2
' i do n't think this should worry anyone , ' he said			0
@entity315 , which is heavily dependent on @entity257 investment , played down wednesday 's deal , saying @entity257 ships had always had access to its ports			0
a government source said it was simply the first time access had been spelled out in a separate accord			0
@entity301 has sought to forge stronger ties with individual members of the @entity340 , including @entity315 , @entity341 and @entity342 , after the 28 - nation bloc , along with the @entity343 , imposed cumulative sanctions on @entity298 for its role in @entity9			2
officials in @entity348 fear this policy is aimed at weakening @entity340 resolve and preventing a further tightening of sanctions			0

new pictures reveal the airport , once used as a *hub* for @entity435 , is a scene of wholesale devastation
