neutron stars are among the densest objects in the universe - just a spoonful of matter from one of them would weigh more than the moon			1
but inside these remarkable stellar objects , which are no bigger than a city on @entity10 , a remarkable process might be taking place			0
scientists have revealed their matter might become so squashed that it turns into ‘ strange matter ’ - and observing so - called strange stars could unlock some of the secrets of the universe			1
scientists at the @entity19 in @entity20 say an undiscovered type of matter could be found in neutron stars ( illustration shown )			1
here matter is so dense that it could be ' squashed ' into strange matter			1
this would create an entire ' strange star ' - unlike anything we have seen the latest theory was proposed by dr @entity31 and dr @entity32 , both of the @entity19 in @entity20			1
they say that some types of neutron stars might be made of a new type of matter called strange matter			1
what the properties of this matter would be , though , are unknown - but it would likely be a ‘ liquid ’ of several types of sub-atomic particles			1
‘ stars , galaxies , planets and even ourselves are made of the so - called baryonic matter , ’ dr @entity46 explained to @entity47			2
quarks are elementary particles , the smallest particles we know to exist			0
when they combine they form compound particles known as hadrons that are grouped in two families - baryons and mesons			2
quarks are said to have six ‘ flavours ’ : up , down , charm , strange , top and bottom ( also known as ' beauty ' )			2
combinations of quarks within these flavours gives rise to the ‘ larger ’ particles			0
groups of three quarks are known as baryons			0
an example of a baryon is a proton , which is made of two ' up ' quarks and a ' down ' quark			0
‘ a baryon , which is a proton or a neutron , is made up of more fundamental particles , known as quarks			2
‘ there are six types ( or flavours ) of quarks			0
they are : up , down , strange , charm , top and bottom			2
‘ depending on how these quarks are combined , different baryons will be formed			0
‘ for instance , two up quarks and one down quark form a proton while two down quarks and one up quark form a neutron			2
’ inside a neutron star , however , dr @entity46 says the neutrons and protons of regular baryonic matter - the stuff that everything around us is made of - can be squeezed so intensely that it turns into a new type of matter - strange matter			1
it would look just like ordinary matter , but would be different to something like dark matter , as it could form physical objects			2
' what differs ordinary matter from strange matter is basically the density , ' said dr @entity46			1
inside a neutron star , dr @entity46 says the neutrons and protons of regular baryonic matter ( protons and neutrons illustrated ) - the stuff that everything around us is made of - can be squeezed so intensely that it turns into a new type of matter - strange matter atoms are usually made of protons , neutrons and electrons			1
these are made of even smaller elementary particles			0
elementary particles , also known as fundamental particles , are the smallest particles we know to exist in the universe			0
they are subdivided into two groups , the first being fermions , which are said to be the particles that make up matter			0
the second are bosons , the force particles that hold the others together			0
within the group of fermions are subatomic particles known as quarks			0
when quarks combine in threes , they form compound particles known as baryons			0
protons are probably the best - known baryons			0
sometimes , quarks interact with corresponding anti-particles ( such as anti-quarks ) , which have the same mass but opposite charges			0
when this happens , they form mesons			0
mesons often turn up in the decay of heavy man - made particles , such as those in particle accelerators , nuclear reactors and cosmic rays			0
mesons , baryons , and other kinds of particles that take part in interactions like these are called hadrons			0
the only known way to find strange matter at the moment would be to confirm its existence within neutron stars			1
on @entity10 , it is currently impossible to directly observe strange matter , even in places like the @entity187 at @entity188 in @entity189			1
pictured is the @entity187 beauty experiment ( @entity192 ) ‘ as its name says , a neutron star is a star made up of neutrons - which are made up of two down and one up quarks , ’ dr @entity46 continued			2
‘ it is a star of very high density and rapid rotation rate			0
most of them have masses close to 1.3 - 1.4 solar masses			0
’ most matter we see comes in two ‘ flavours ’ , made up of just two types of fundamental particles - up and down quarks			2
when the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse at the end of its life , protons and electrons are literally scrunched together , leaving behind one of nature 's most wondrous creations : a neutron star			2
neutron stars cram roughly 1.3 to 2.5 solar masses into a city - sized sphere perhaps 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) across			1
matter is packed so tightly that a sugar - cube - sized amount of material would weigh more than 1 billion tons , about the same as @entity228			2
but in these extreme conditions a rare type of three - flavour matter , made of up , down and strange quarks , could be being created			1
this is what strange matter would be			1
and dr @entity46 says , if the neutron star is massive enough and rotating at a fast enough speed , the entire star could be made of this matter			1
the star would be much smaller and lighter than a neutron star			2
for example , a neutron star with a mass 0.2 times that of the sun would have a radius greater than nine miles ( 15km ) , but a strange star of the same mass would be less than a third the size			1
one of the implications of the theory , if true , would be that there might be more types of matter in the universe than we know of			0
dr @entity46 says , as we can not observe individual fundamental particles like quarks on @entity10 , the only way to prove strange matter ’s existence would be to spot it in a neutron star			1
interestingly , though , proving that strange stars exist could also provide a detection for one of the ‘ holy grails ’ of astronomy - gravitational waves			1
dr @entity46 says the interaction of a neutron star and a strange star ( illustration shown ) could create ripples in space - times , resulting in gravitational waves			1
these are one of the ' holy grails ' of astronomy that have been impossible to detect in other experiments so far gravitational waves are said to be ripples in space - time caused by the interaction of massive objects in the universe			1
however , their existence has been hard to prove , despite numerous attempts to find them			0
dr @entity46 says that , if strange stars exist , they could be interacting with regular neutron stars in binary systems and producing these noticeable effects			1
observing such a system could result in a ‘ gravitational wave detection , ’ said dr @entity46 , ‘ which is one of the most challenging experimental breakthroughs of the century			0
’ for now , just the existence of strange matter and stars themselves would be hugely interesting			1
it would suggest there are objects in the universe that are far beyond our current understanding .			0

scientists at the @entity19 in @entity20 say an undiscovered type of matter could be found in neutron stars
here matter is so dense that it could be ' squashed ' into strange matter
this would create an entire ' strange star ' - unlike anything we have seen
however , the exact properties of strange matter are unknown
if it exists , though , it could help scientists discover ripples in space - time known as gravitational waves
