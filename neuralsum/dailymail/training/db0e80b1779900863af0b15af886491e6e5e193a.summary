@entity43 captain @entity25 has been selected in @entity3 's @entity2 modern era @entity24 @entity25 's ( right ) all action approach in midfield has made him a @entity43 and @entity2 legend @entity20 : little ginger nut was a star @entity20 was playing tiki - taka football when nobody in @entity53 knew what it was			1
he was another of those players , like @entity57 or @entity58 , who at 15 probably looked as if he would n’t make it			0
too small , you would think - ca n’t run , dumpy little ginger nut - but then the ball would come to him and he would dazzle you			0
he was the best footballer in that @entity64 midfield , better than @entity65 and @entity66			0
@entity25 is joined by @entity64 great @entity20 in @entity3 's midfield the former @entity53 midfielder enjoyed a glittering career at @entity70 winning 11 @entity2 titles @entity65 would have solved @entity53 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity74 heralded a change in @entity77 football ... he introduced @entity78 and scouting reports @entity80 has the class of @entity82 but his attitude is holding back his talent @entity85 and @entity66 are warriors ... they were even prepared to do battle while working on tv ! why @entity3 fears that the @entity77 manager is in danger of becoming extinct @entity85 nearly crossed @entity91 to join @entity92 ... and @entity93 was close to signing too pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players ... the @entity2 killed all that ! @entity11 's @entity100 interviews @entity3 about his new book @entity93 : how i missed out on signing him at @entity92 despite all that has happened in his career since , one of the biggest regrets of my life in management is not taking @entity93 to @entity92 when we had the chance			1
‘ you ’ve got to take him , @entity3 , ’ @entity111 told me			2
’ yet all of our scouts ’ reports said that at @entity115 he played wide off a striker , whereas we were looking for a proper front man			2
just when i was on the verge of taking the plunge , the price went up			0
in the end he was sold for £ 22.8million to @entity43			0
we would n’t have paid that			0
@entity93 scored 31 @entity2 goals in a stellar personal season at @entity43 last term @entity3 reveals he had the opportunity to sign @entity93 for @entity92 while he was at @entity129 side @entity115 @entity93 ( centre ) joined @entity43 for £ 22.8million in january 2011 from @entity115 @entity131 : my @entity132 there is no way i can leave @entity131 out of this team because i tipped him at 16 to be the greatest centre - half in @entity138 and i think , for a time , that is exactly what he was			1
@entity141 was a tank , but @entity143 is the @entity132			2
