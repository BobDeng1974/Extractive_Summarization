by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity4 defender @entity3 has returned to training to help ease @entity7 's central defensive concerns ahead of the season - opener against @entity9			1
the @entity10 international was substituted at half - time of sunday 's comprehensive 3 - 0 @entity13 win over @entity14 with an @entity16 problem			1
but @entity3 is back in training and could still be available for the saturday 's clash against @entity20 ' side			0
training day : @entity3 ( left ) has given @entity4 a timely boost by returning to full training cometh the hour ... @entity3 has a knack of scoring crucial goals , and equalised in may 's @entity27 final without @entity3 , @entity7 would face something of a dilemma in central defence			2
his only other established central defender , @entity31 , just started pre-season training on monday following @entity35 's @entity34 success			0
limited options : per @entity31 is only just back in training and @entity38 is a left back by trade @entity40 has played at centre back in all three of his pre-season appearances for the @entity43 since his Â£ 16million arrival from @entity45 and looks set to feature in the heart of @entity4 's defence on saturday			1
@entity38 , who is a left back by trade , could be used as a makeshift centre back if @entity7 decides not to risk @entity3 or @entity31 ahead of next week 's @entity51 qualifier against @entity52			0
mature beyond his years : @entity40 has impressed for @entity4 in pre-season playing at centre back			0

@entity3 is back in training and should be fit for the weekend
the defender came off at half - time of sunday 's @entity13 *victory*
the @entity43 take on @entity9 at the @entity62 on saturday
@entity7 is likely to be without @entity31 for the match
@entity66 leaving to @entity67 has left @entity4 short defensively
