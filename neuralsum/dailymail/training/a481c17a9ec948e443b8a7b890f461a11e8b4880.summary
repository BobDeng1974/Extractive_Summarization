by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 12:19 est , 21 february 2013 a @entity2 inventor has made a ' tsunami survival ' capsule , and is to test it by going over @entity6			1
aerospace engineer @entity7 , 50 , believes his disaster - proof pod will save people from tidal waves , tornadoes , hurricanes , earthquakes and super storms			1
and he is so confident of the life - saving aluminium ball that he will ride it down the world - famous 167ft waterfall			2
survival : former @entity21 engineer @entity20 has designed a pod which will keep people safe during natural disasters including tsunamis and hurricanes he said : ' we can tell people how strong it is , but until you 've proved that it 's saved a life they might not believe you			1
' mr @entity7 claims the sphere will protect him from the massive impact , which will be similar to being rear ended by a car at about 20 mph			2
he believes the capsule will keep people safe in natural disasters , such as the tsunamis which hit @entity40 and @entity41			1
in a tsunami the main danger is not drowning in the fast flowing water but being crushed by the debris which is swept along			2
he said : ' since it 's a sphere , when you do run into something it 's just going to glance off			0
' in most cases , you 're probably going to be a bit lighter than those objects so those objects will just go along their way and kind of move you			0
' drop : mr @entity7 is to prove how strong the pod is by going over @entity6 mr @entity7 was born in @entity57 , @entity58 , but now lives in @entity59 in the @entity60			1
the former @entity21 engineer has taken his prototypes to the @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity41 , and sponsors have commissioned further production			0
now mr @entity7 and his business partners are hoping to sell different models of the capsule for between £ 650 and £ 3,250 disaster : @entity2 search and rescue teams on the ground in @entity73 , @entity41 , where they were flown in to help search for survivors of the county 's biggest earthquake and subsequent tsunami in 2011 he claims the capsule will keep up to six people safe for several hours while it is buffeted by a @entity84 's powerful wave			1
he said : ' after the tsunami in @entity41 , we decided we had to develop it and get it out there for the masses			0
' there are 135 countries worldwide exposed to the tsunami wave			0
' if you can save one life , it would be worth producing it			0

@entity7 invented pod to help people survive natural disasters
capsule is made of aluminium and designed to keep six people safe for hours
will test how much protection it offers by going over @entity6
