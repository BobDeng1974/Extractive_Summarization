a healthy 44 - year - old yoga fan in @entity2 , @entity3 , never knew he would help a renal disease sufferer in @entity5 , @entity6 , four months later			1
but @entity7 and @entity8 , 47 , are the start and end of an astonishing 60 - person chain of kidney transplants , setting a world record			1
mr @entity7 ’s kind donation last august began a chain that saw 30 donors give kidneys to 30 strangers who could have died without one			1
but her blood type did n’t match - so she donated hers to a woman in @entity44 , @entity45 , after mr @entity7 ’s gift , and the chain continued			2
the @entity48 went through rounds of psychological and medical tests before he could donate a kidney , reported the @entity52			0
‘ people think it ’s so odd that i ’m donating a kidney , ’ he told a hospital transplant coordinator			0
‘ i think it ’s so odd that they think it ’s so odd			0
’ the @entity61 man got the idea after a worker at his yoga studio said she donated a kidney to an ill friend she bumped into at a @entity69 store			2
his donation kicked off a widespread four - month chain of 17 hospitals across 11 states that ended with mr @entity8 , reported the @entity52			1
' people think it ’s so odd that i ’m donating a kidney			0
i think it ’s so odd that they think it ’s so odd ' @entity7 mr @entity8 was in terrible pain and facing a five - year wait for a kidney as nobody in his family was willing or able to give him one of theirs			1
but he was saved by the chain from @entity88 that ended at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity6			2
there were amazing stories on the way , such as the @entity93 man who gave his ex-girlfriend a kidney for the sake of their little daughter			0
and a woman from @entity100 gave her kidney to her fifth cousin in @entity103 , after unintentionally meeting him in @entity104 , reported the @entity52			0

@entity107 began in august with @entity7 , 44 , in @entity2 , @entity3
