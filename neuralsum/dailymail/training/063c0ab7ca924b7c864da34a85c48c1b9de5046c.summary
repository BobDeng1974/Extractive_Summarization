a seven - bedroom mansion would normally set you back millions of pounds , but a stately home in the @entity4 borders is going on the market for just £ 1			1
@entity6 , in the @entity7 , is steeped in historical significance , and has been owned by some of @entity11 's wealthiest families			1
the vast @entity14 listed @entity13 home is set in beautiful countryside and includes such luxuries as an ornate music room decorated in @entity19 plasterwork			1
but anybody who decides to take it on will have to work hard before revelling in its luxury - the house has been derelict since 2007 , and is currently in such a state that it is considered dangerous			0
faded glory : @entity6 in the @entity7 is currently on the market for just £ 1			1
but before prospective buyers start digging around behind the sofa cushion , it is so derelict it needs a £ 1.2m refurbishment former glory : the property before it fell into disrepair			1
it has been owned by a number of prestigious @entity11 families throughout the years @entity6 's new owner will have to be committed to returning the manor to its former splendour - any potential buyer will have to prove that they plan to spend around £ 1.2million regenerating it			1
£ 1 will buy : a chicken mayo burger at @entity43 two second class stamps tights from @entity46 a lottery ticket £ 1m will get you : @entity14 listed @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 , has three bedrooms and the beach by the front door @entity55 has launched the world 's largest television			1
named @entity59 , the television is eight metres by five metres , or 370 inches , which is around the size of a football goal			0
upmarket jewellers @entity64 sell an antique rose - cut diamond necklace for £ 1m @entity67 , head of residential sales at @entity70 estate agents , said : ' it is unusual and this is quite a unique situation			2
the house provides a great opportunity for someone to rescue a historic building and create a wonderful home			2
' i appreciate advertising the property at the low price might seem curious but we do n't want people pouring money into a black hole , so we had to peg the price as low as possible			0
' the wings of the house have been demolished while the main structure falls further and further into a state of disarray			0
the property is currently on the @entity91 and in need of a hero			0
it was once owned by the @entity96 family of @entity97			0
@entity96 of @entity6 , who died around 1749 , was one of the principal clerks of the @entity100 - @entity4 's supreme civil court			1
early in the 19th century ownership moved to @entity102 of the @entity104 family , who held it until the 1980s			0
since then the house and its park have passed through the hands of developers			0
this is still far less than you would be spending on a similar sized house in @entity114 however - with some seven bedroom properties on sale now for around £ 40million			2
even the ' cheaper ' ones on the market cost significantly more than it would to buy , restore and immaculately furnish the @entity121 mansion			0
a seven bedroom stately home in @entity124 which resembles the @entity125 is on the market for £ 12million , while you can land yourself a slightly more modern home in @entity130 for upwards of £ 9million			2
@entity6 is within a stone 's throw of border town @entity134 and just 40 minutes from both @entity135 and @entity136			2
it is surrounded by a number of prestigious golf courses and close to the @entity139 - renowned for its salmon fishing , meaning it could make the perfect home for a traditional @entity11 sports enthusiast			1
the advert on property website @entity145 states : ' the property , currently derelict and on the @entity91 requires completed restoration and would be a significant undertaking but when complete would be an impressive country residence			2
' fixer - upper : years of hard work and a significant investment will eventually net the buyer a seven - bedroom house in glorious countryside the wings of the house have been demolished while the main structure falls further and further into a state of disarray			0
the property is currently on the @entity91			0
it includes such luxuries as an ornate music room decorated in @entity19 plasterwork			1

however , they will be expected to commit to spending at least £ 1.2million refurbishing the imposing property
