prosecutor @entity45 told the jury : ' on the evening of friday november 29 last year @entity0 was standing with his friend @entity47 outside @entity48 's @entity49			1
' they were having a last drink outside as were a number of people			0
the atmosphere in the alleyway was good but it was interrupted by a group of approximately seven men and a man named @entity44			0
' faces obscured by hoods and scarves , their conduct was menacing , some were carrying bats and at least one knife			0
' @entity0 had his back to the advancing group until at the last moment he turned			1
