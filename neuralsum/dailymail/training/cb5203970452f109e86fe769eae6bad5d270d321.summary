' i was getting increasingly concerned as the day went on			0
the vomiting and diarrhoea would n't stop and @entity8 was a very private person , and it was horrific to see what was going on			1

i was n't in the physical state to go			0

' the next thing i discovered , they were back at my house , my brother - in - law is a black taxi driver and he brought them back			2
' he continued : ' they did n't take her in @entity83 because i think they were concerned it was the norovirus , even though it was clear - the paramedics said to me : " this looks like salmonella			2
" more than 30 diners fell ill with food poisoning after the meal at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 ' they gave her a shot of something in the ambulance			1
they [ @entity83 ] sort of turned her away			0

the paramedics took over and we went downstairs to let them do their job			0
we hoped for a different outcome , but she had n't breathed now for 45 minutes			0
' paramedics took my brother - in - law outside and i think they was going to say she was clinically gone , and they then felt a pulse and they took her to hospital			2
' mr @entity141 told the court that this time he travelled in the ambulance with his wife , regardless of his own condition			0
he said : ' it did n't matter to me what state i was in			0
' i left with her and my mother - in - law left in a different ambulance			1
' mrs @entity8 was pronounced dead at the hospital on december 27th at around 08:15am			1

@entity18 , of @entity11 , and @entity158 , of @entity159 , @entity12 , also deny perverting the course of justice by falsifying records in a ' daily kitchen due diligence log ' relating to the cooking and cooling of turkey meat			1
the pair are accused of failing to properly monitor the temperature of the turkey as it cooked			0
following the incident , they allegedly falsified their food safety records to hand to health and safety inspectors			1
@entity18 further denies obstructing an officer in the course of their duty by handing the falsified documents to food safety inspectors			1
@entity181 - @entity180 , prosecuting , told the court : ' @entity20 grossly , grossly mismanaged the preparation of the @entity185 turkey			2
' by that act he caused his employer , the company , to place unsafe food before its customers on christmas day			2
mrs @entity8 , who tragically later died , was initially seen at @entity67 in @entity68 , pictured ' @entity191 was in overall charge			1
she knew , she must have known , that mr @entity20 did not follow safety procedures			2
her default is clear , she should have intervened			0
' referring to the charge of perverting the course of justice , mr @entity180 said : ' the actions of @entity191 and mr @entity20 in the immediate aftermath of this tragedy were not those of innocent actors caught up in a tragedy not of their making			0
' news of a possible food poisoning outbreak reached @entity208 sometime in the morning on @entity44			2
@entity209 , a diner , had returned to the hotel to complain			0
' he added : ' @entity191 contacted the company , who by 1pm on @entity44 were aware that six people had reported illness			2
' @entity217 attended on the 27th and , by that time , all trace of the @entity185 meal had disappeared			2
there were no samples for the officers to seize			0
' he continued : ' clearly the turkey breasts were cooked and cooled , otherwise they could not have been reheated and served the following day , @entity185			0
but when and for how long , we simply do not know			0
' mr @entity180 claimed the kitchen logbooks showed ' the kitchen of @entity208 paid lip service only to the systems the company had prescribed but did not enforce '			1
the bacterium @entity17 is widely distributed in the environment and food			1
it is the third most common cause of food poisoning in the @entity237			2
if spores of the bacteria survive cooking , they can germinate to form growing cells			2
spores can not grow in a refrigerator or freezer but thrive at room temperature			0
in optimal growing conditions , the organism has a generation time of 10 to 12 minutes			0
when a large number of the vegetative cells are consumed this will more - likely - than - not lead to gastroenteritis			0
food poisoning from the bacteria most often occurs when foodstuffs , usually red meat or poultry , is prepared in advance and kept warm for several hours before serving			1
the illness , with diarrhoea and abdominal pain the main symptoms , generally lasts for less than 24 hours but elderly people may be more seriously affected			0
the bacteria is also responsible for 80 - 95 per cent of gas gangrene cases , a rare but severe form of gangrene			2

more than 30 diners fell ill after eating at pub in @entity11 , @entity12
one woman , mother - of - one @entity8 , died after the meal
inspectors found bacteria @entity17 was likely cause
former owner , ex-chef and pub 's parent company are now on trial
they all deny serving food that was unfit for human consumption
prosecutors claim kitchen staff ' paid lip service ' to safety rules
