by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 i 'm getting to know @entity3 at this @entity4 while working with him for @entity5			1
in his autobiography he confessed to not being a huge fan of the press and detailed how they had stitched him up as a player			0
in his coaching role with the @entity12 the press regularly laid into him and that appears to have left its mark on @entity3			1
i ’m not sure if his view of the media will ever recover from the pounding it took when he left @entity18 out of the @entity20 squad for the @entity21			2
back in the day : @entity3 was in charge of the @entity12 under 21 side for six years until 2013 so in my position , embarking on any conversation with @entity3 feels like a non-starter – if you ’re a member of the media you have to prove something to him before he starts to trust you			1
it ’s hard for him i guess but he should shake off those pre-conceived notions of people just because of the industry they work in , especially when judging people he has n’t previously met			0
it ’s been hard work at times , talking to @entity3 , but it ’s been worth it in the end			0
i could n’t care less if he likes me or not , as long as we work well together that ’s my priority			0
i do n’t need any @entity45 cards off him			0
but i do want to learn from his vast experience			0
he played in semi finals of major tournaments so of course there are a million questions to ask him			0
and as time has gone on , he ’s eased down the drawbridge and i ’ve been happy to listen to his football knowledge and ask questions			0
i admired @entity3 greatly as a player , and now i ’ve found him to be a good laugh at times			0
it ’s fair to say i do n’t always agree with him on everything though			0
after watching @entity60 ’s @entity4 win this week he made a fantastic point that i ’m going to throw out there , to see what you think			1
safe hands : @entity66 has established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the world defensive duties : @entity71 ( left ) and @entity72 both came through the @entity74 set - up the @entity60 team that beat @entity76 4 - 0 featured six players who started for their under 21 side in the @entity80 final in @entity81 back in 2009			1
@entity66 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 were all victors over @entity3 ’s @entity12 that night in @entity86			1
others from that young @entity60 side in 2009 switched allegiance : @entity90 played for their @entity91 in their win over @entity93 on monday ; @entity94 played for @entity95 at @entity96			1
so let ’s get this right – eight of the 11 who started for @entity60 in their @entity100 under 21 final win over @entity12 in 2009 have gone on to play at a major , senior international tournament and six of them started for @entity60 against @entity76 on monday and won 4 - 0			1
that is how it should be – the junior side feeding the talent to the senior side			2
the @entity12 side from back in 2009 may have lost heavily , but at least made it to the final			1
of that starting line up only @entity114 is at this @entity4			1
@entity116 would have started but he was suspended for the final in @entity81			2
chance : @entity83 played for @entity119 before joining @entity120 for £ 42million last summer progression : @entity82 ( left ) and @entity84 ( right with @entity122 ) also played in 2009 so what of the rest ? @entity126 ’s career ended in near - tragic circumstances			1
@entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 never went on to play for @entity12			1
@entity133 and @entity134 have massively under - achieved in their careers so far and need to work much harder			0
@entity137 has talent , but needs to do more to convince @entity139 he ’s @entity120 ’s first choice left - back			0
and the other was @entity143 who but for injury would have been at this @entity4			2
so only two @entity12 players from that under 21 side have progressed to become @entity12 regulars in the starting line - up – @entity143 and @entity116 while @entity114 is a squad regular			1
compared to the @entity153 side that is pathetic			2
for @entity3 , players and clubs not taking junior international football seriously is a major issue , and those six @entity153 players prove his point			2
only a year ago @entity160 and @entity161 both thought they were too good for the @entity12			2
pulling out of the @entity12 has been a feature of @entity164 football for years now ; who can forget the farce in the summer of 2011 when both @entity167 and @entity168 withdrew from @entity3 ’s squad			1
by now @entity168 should be a certain starter for @entity12 when fit , but his development has been restricted – just ask @entity171			2
as for @entity167 , well a talent that looked effective at @entity96 now looks like a spent force			0
another one who needs to work harder			0
@entity176 survivors : only @entity114 ( left ) and @entity116 remain from @entity12 's 2009 under 21 side who knows if a bigger commitment to the @entity12 and below would have turned @entity12 into more of a force at @entity181 and @entity80 over the years ? @entity3 clearly believes it ’s a major factor in our lack of success			1
last week @entity186 announced his retirement aged just 29 , he even started crying over it			0
back in 2007 @entity186 thought he was too good for the @entity12 and pulled out of the @entity80 squad			1
an extremely talented player , but without the mental strength to realise how to make a success of being a top level footballer , who could make an impact at @entity181			0
back in 2007 , @entity186 said : ' we need strong characters in the @entity12 team '			2
he should have pointed that high - powered perception at himself			0
what a waste of talent			0
whether you like him or not , whether you think he ’s a good manager or not , @entity3 is absolutely right to point out how the commitment to the @entity12 in @entity60 has helped their senior side			1
not pushed on : @entity167 failed to make the @entity12 squad while @entity168 has yet to establish himself			1

@entity60 *fielded* six players from their 2009 @entity210 winning side against @entity76
@entity66 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 all featured
only @entity114 and @entity116 made @entity12 's @entity4 squad from the same tournament
@entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 never went on to play for @entity12
