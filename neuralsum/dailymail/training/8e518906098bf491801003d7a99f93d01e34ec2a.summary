by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:13 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 07:08 est , 31 january 2014 the furore over the government ’s handling of the devastating floods in @entity8 is ‘ irrelevant ’ to the people affected , @entity3 has claimed			1
the senior @entity11 minister dismissed the ‘ lynch mob ’ looking for someone to blame after communities on the @entity14 spent a month under water			1
insisting ‘ this is the winter , it is wet , it has rained ’ , he also defied climate sceptics in his party to suggest the storms may have been may be ‘ made worse ’ by climate change			2
@entity11 minister @entity3 accused the media of whipping up a ' lynch mob ' against the government , which was irrelevant to the people affected by the floods in @entity8 troops have been sent in to as @entity8 is braced for more floods			1
environment secretary @entity31 has admitted it could take 20 years to solve the area ’s problems			2
high winds , torrential rain and a tidal surge are expected to swamp coastal defences and swell already bursting rivers over the weekend			1
this will spell more misery for the @entity14 , which have been under water for a month			1
ministers have come under fire for not acting sooner , and after backlash from local mps @entity46 this week appeared to take charge of the situation personally			2
he announced dredging would resume as soon as is practical and warned @entity53 colleagues that arguments between departments would not be tolerated			2
@entity11 minister @entity3 however , mr @entity3 accused the media of whipping up mock anger about the problems in @entity8			1
he said it was a ' journalistic cliche ' that when there is a disaster ' somebody has got to be to blame '			1
appearing on @entity66 ’s @entity65 , he said : ‘ i do think the present furore about @entity8 , who ’s to blame , somebody ’s got to be summoned , the sort - of lynch mob stuff is slightly irrelevant to the people there and it should be addressed sensibly and professionally			1
’ he added : ‘ this is the winter , it is wet , it has rained			0
it may be made worse by climate change			0
’ he also rejected the idea that the floods proved that the government was failing to address problems caused by global warming			0
‘ i think it ’s ridiculous to take this example and say we ’re ignoring climate change – i ’ve noticed a few windmills , i ’ve noticed a few solar panels , i ’ve noticed energy bills going up and then people in a populist way saying ‘ we ’re going to have a political price on energy ’ when you have an international wholesale market and we ’re trying to reduce the carbon levels			1
’ local people have put up banners and flags in the village of @entity99 demanding the government act to dredge the river to stop a repeat of the devastating floods with more rain forecast , @entity105 staff have brought in extra sandbags to for properties near the @entity109 government sources stressed that mr @entity3 was not criticising those affected by the ‘ real tragedy ’ of the floods			1
but his comments come the @entity105 faces renewed criticism for stopping dredging in the mid- 1990s			0
more than 60 pumps are running at full power to drain an estimated 1.5million tons of water from the flooded area but more storms will only deepen the crisis , which has seen the @entity105 accused of gross incompetence for failing to dredge clogged rivers that have burst their banks			1
@entity127 , deputy chief executive of @entity128 , said the levels could be under water for weeks			1
the @entity131 has sent three military planners – an @entity134 major and captain and a lieutenant commander from the @entity137 – to meet council chiefs to assess the disaster			0
surveying the scene : @entity141 , sergeant @entity142 and @entity143 of @entity128 look at a map in @entity99 high up : the @entity131 has sent three military planners ¿ an @entity134 major and captain and a lieutenant commander from the @entity137 ¿ to meet council chiefs to assess the disaster coming in : at first light , an advanced party of engineers rolled into the drowned villages to scope out the worst - affected areas and work out how to help them mr @entity31 said last night after chairing a meeting of the government ’s @entity160 emergency committee : ‘ we established that we do need a proper 20 - year plan to satisfactorily cover this very specialist part of the country			0
‘ it ’s clear from our forecasts that there is further bad weather coming in , there will be heavy rain and that , combined with significant high spring tides around the coast , mean that i ’m afraid there is real risk of flooding to properties			1
’ he reiterated @entity46 ’s call for dredging to restart for the first time since 2005			0
the prime minister tried to seize control of the situation on wednesday , calling for an end to the arguments that have held up action and insisting that dredging must go ahead			1
the @entity105 has come in for severe criticism for stopping dredging in the mid- 1990s			0
but @entity189 , operations director at the quango , who earns more than £ 160,000 a year , told @entity191 last night : ‘ people are trying to make this an @entity105 - only problem			1
on a recce : 24 commando driving in @entity99 , @entity8 yesterday motoring on : members of 24 @entity197 were carrying out reconnaissance to work out the lay of the land and to identify flooded areas getting through : members of 24 @entity197 ( 54 @entity202 ) drive through flood water in @entity99 , @entity8 trouble ahead : a @entity205 satellite image shows the huge storm over the @entity207 heading for the @entity208 ‘ it is something which is shared by others and must be owned by others so we come to a collective and agreed way forward			1
’ his organisation has pledged only £ 350,000 to dredge the two key rivers in @entity8 – the @entity109 and tone – an operation which will cost at least £ 4million			2
yet it has been willing to spend £ 20million on a bird sanctuary on the @entity8 coast			0
‘ we have a responsibility to ensure that the taxpayers ’ money we are given to invest in reducing flood risk is spent to the best effect , ’ mr @entity189 said			2
‘ we are committed to the dredging , we have put money on the table and that wo n’t change			0
but it is also clear that other parties need to pay their way too			0
‘ we believe that even had the dredging taken place , we would still be seeing very extensive flooding across the @entity14			1
’ mr @entity31 said a plan would be in place within six weeks for a long - term approach to tackling flood risk in @entity8			2
‘ we established quite quickly that we do need to dredge quite quickly the two main rivers , we established that we do need a proper 20 - year plan , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ve given all the local agencies six weeks to come together with a definitive plan			0
’ @entity248 from @entity249 , based in nearby @entity250 , are on standby to assist in the crisis as the fresh storms approach			0
response team : @entity105 staff lay sandbags to protect homes next to the @entity109 in @entity99 , @entity8 more trouble ahead : @entity105 staff lay sandbags to protect homes next to the @entity109 in @entity99 , @entity8 a team of 30 @entity260 volunteers today used a @entity262 rescue vehicle to deliver logs and coal to residents who are only able to leave their village by boat stranded locals on board a rescue boat are transported from the village of @entity272 in @entity8 a specialist @entity260 off - road vehicle trundles past two emergency personnel as it delivers fire wood to the village of @entity272 in @entity8 a @entity260 rescue vehicle delivers fire wood to residents in the village of @entity272 that has been cut off by flooding for weeks they are able to reach stranded communities with rigid inflatable boats or amphibious landing craft			0
they are also preparing to fill sandbags , ferry food , fuel and other supplies , and carry residents from flooded homes			0
a unit of @entity248 serving with 24 @entity197 , based in @entity295 , @entity296 , was also dispatched to survey the damage			0
the fire brigade has brought in hovercraft and the @entity260 is using emergency teams to reach stranded flood victims , who are furious with the way the crisis has been handled			2
@entity305 , 27 , a mother - of - three from @entity306 , said : ‘ when other countries have disasters our government is happy to fund them but when we are in our own disaster they do n’t seem to want to know or care			0
@entity8 firemen set up a pumping station near flood water in @entity99 to divert water from a field into the @entity319 man the pumps : the @entity105 has come in for severe criticism for stopping dredging in the mid- 1990s help at hand : coal and firewood being distributed by the @entity260 in @entity272 , @entity8 i do n’t think anyone is going to be surprised that there is now all this debate about who is going to pay			1
’ @entity332 , whose home in @entity272 has been cut off since @entity334 , said the issue of dredging was vital			0
‘ the dredging will help a little bit but that ’s all we need – a little bit , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity341 would lower the flooding by an inch or two and that ’s all we really need to save those people in the village that have flooded			2

@entity11 minister accuses the media of trying to find ' somebody to blame '
insists the attacks are ' irrelevant ' to people hit by the tragedy of flood
