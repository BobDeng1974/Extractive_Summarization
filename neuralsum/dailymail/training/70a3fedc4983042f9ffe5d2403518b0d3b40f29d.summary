by @entity0 @entity1 , the secretive daughter of former @entity4 pm @entity3 , is said to be behind a £ 3.7m endowment to @entity6 one of @entity4 's most senior political families is bankrolling a professorship at @entity6 , despite the university denying any link with the country 's government , it was claimed today			1
@entity1 , daughter of @entity4 's former prime minister @entity3 , is said to be behind a £ 3.7million endowment from the secretive @entity17 that funded @entity6 's professor in @entity19			1
@entity6 has always denied any links between the post and @entity22 , saying only that the foundation was set up by two wealthy individuals who wished to remain anonymous			2
but the university now faces claims that @entity4 is buying influence at the world famous university after a new report suggests that the foundation is run by ms @entity3			1
the new claims come from a previously unpublished interview with @entity4 businesswoman @entity34 , founder of the @entity36 nursery chain , in which she made a link between ms @entity3 and the @entity17			2
discussing giving a 29 per cent stake in her business to miss @entity3 , the @entity22 entrepreneur said : ' we gave the shares to her charity organisation			0
the charity @entity46 owns the shares ' , the @entity44 reported			0
if the claims are correct , the suggestion that a powerful political family in @entity4 might have bought influence at @entity6 will raise concerns			2
one academic told the @entity44 that it seemed as if a foreign government had appointed a professor at @entity6			0
they said : ' how , if the foundation 's money came from the family of the head of @entity55 for over a decade , and if the foundation was able to name the first occupant of the chair , can @entity6 demonstrate academic independence ? ' the professorship is currently filled by professor @entity67 , who is well - known to the @entity3 family and who has held the post since it was created in 2012			1
an international authority on @entity4 , professor @entity67 has co-written a book on @entity4 with ms @entity3 's husband , @entity74 , and is said to have acted as a tutor to ms @entity3			1
he is said to have identified the foundation as a possible sponsor for the post			0
ms @entity3 belongs to @entity4 's ruling elite , and her family is known for its wealth and power , though she is so secretive , she has been described as ' @entity3 's mysterious daughter '			1
ruling elite : ms @entity3 's father , @entity3 , was @entity4 's prime minister for a decade and is known for his wealth she studied at @entity86 and the @entity87 in the @entity88 , before working on @entity90 's @entity89 using the pseudonym , @entity92			1
she then moved to the @entity93 when her husband began a phd at the @entity6 , where , it is said , she was tutored by professor @entity67			2
her father was @entity4 's prime minister for a decade until march last year , while her mother , @entity98 , is a jewellery expert and leading figure in the lucrative diamond trade			2
when the professorship was created in january 2012 , @entity6 said that the endowment had come from the @entity17 which was registered to a trust in @entity105			0
the foundation has no website , and trusts registered in @entity105 are legally able to keep their details private			0
the new report raises questions over whether @entity4 can be accused of trying to buy influence in academia today , however , professor @entity67 declined to speak to @entity114 , while his university insisted that the donation - which some suggested might threaten the university 's academic independence - was above board			1
a @entity6 spokesman said : ' the donation from the @entity17 was fully verified and approved by the @entity6 @entity122 on @entity123			0
' no more details will be released as the donors , as is common practice , have requested complete anonymity			0
' this afternoon the subject of @entity4 's ' intrusions ' into @entity131 - speaking universities was the subject for discussion at @entity134 think - tank , the @entity135 .			0

@entity6 's @entity137 in @entity19 is funded by £ 3.7m gift

new report says the foundation is controlled by ' mysterious ' @entity1
she is the daughter of former @entity4 prime minister , @entity3
@entity6 has always denied links to @entity4 's political elite
