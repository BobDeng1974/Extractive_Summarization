shocked passengers yesterday described watching as the @entity16 jet ’s port - side engine covering ripped off on take - off from @entity18 , exposing its inner workings			1
just minutes later the plane ’s starboard engine exploded into flames , leaving a trail of black smoke			1
the @entity25 can reveal that passengers had reported vibrations and whistling in the cabin – over the wing area where the engines are located – during the plane ’s previous flight on thursday night			1
alternative routes over countryside to airports such as @entity59 , @entity60 or @entity61 in @entity62 were possible			0
@entity16 confirmed that air accident investigators were looking at technical faults involving both engines			2
the most likely theory at the centre of the investigation is that maintenance crews simply failed to properly lock the metal cowls which protect the engines before take - off			0
if engines are not properly encased by locking the metal cowls , debris can enter the engines			0
this can cause fires , experts said			0
all 75 passengers and five crew were evacuated via the emergency chutes from @entity82 to @entity83 yesterday , with ambulance crews treating three people for minor injuries			1
passengers on the crippled 150 - seat jet told how the cabin ‘ glowed orange ’ after the @entity92 ’s right engine caught fire			1
the drama happened as the flight returned to @entity18 – about 15 minutes after air traffic control had alerted the pilot at take - off to smoke coming from the plane and debris on the runway , possibly from one or both engines			2
passengers said the casing of the left engine started to break away from the plane during take - off			1
a picture taken from inside the aircraft which shows the engine on the port side of the plane			1
passengers have said the fire could be seen coming from the starboard engine the starboard engine appears charred as the plane sits on the runway after making the emergency landing this morning @entity124 , a company director , said : ‘ as the plane started to gather speed on the runway for take - off , the engine casing came loose and started flapping and at the point of take - off it snapped off with a loud bang			1
‘ on the descent back into @entity18 the right engine burst into flames , creating an orange glow visible throughout the cabin			2
‘ people were relatively calm until the engine blew , and then they started to panic			0
’ another passenger , @entity136 , tweeted a picture of the loose left engine cowling			1
he said : ‘ about eight or nine minutes into the flight there was a loud popping sound , not an explosion but definitely not usual sounds			0
‘ the captain came on very calmly , said he was aware of the situation and that everything was running normally and he was going to run some tests			0
‘ then another five minutes after that there was a loud sound , and this time the right engine was clearly on fire			2
' i mean , big flames , very visible from the rest of the cabin and lots of black smoke			0
’ eyewitnesses have described hearing ' a blowout ' and seeing one of the engines on fire while it was in the air the @entity16 aircraft , which was bound for @entity83 , is seen sitting on the northern runway at @entity18 he praised the ‘ outstanding ’ cabin crew and ground grew for bringing the plane down safely			1
passengers had reported vibrations and whistling in the cabin during the plane ’s previous flight returning from @entity178 in @entity179 on thursday night			2
bird strikes can cause huge problems for planes and airports will use a variety of methods to keep flight paths clear			0
commercial pilot and instructor @entity187 , spokesman for the @entity189 , told @entity191 bird strikes can cause ' significant damage ' to engines			2
he said : ' if they have had a bird or a number of birds ingested into the engine then it can cause significant damage to the engine , particularly if the engine is on a high power setting , such as at take - off			1
' there 's nothing definite until the investigation is completed , quite obviously , but if the plane was to ingest a number of birds which hit the front fans in the engine as it rotates at high speed , and it causes damage there , then what that leads to is an imbalance in the engine			1
a source said : ‘ the noises were reported to the flight deck but the crew did not seem to be too concerned			0
the captain even came out to speak to the passengers and reassure them that everything was fine			0
’ @entity226 , of @entity228 magazine , said engine fire was the most serious incident pilots face but also the one for which they practise the most			1
he said two - engined planes such as the @entity92 were perfectly capable of flying on one engine			0
@entity16 said the request to return to @entity18 had been made because it was ‘ the most suitable ’ location to deal with the problems identified			2
the airline confirmed both engines suffered damage but said it would be for accident investigators to determine what caused the damage and determine which engine was compromised first			2
@entity16 said in relation to the jet ’s @entity178 flight , it would be ‘ inappropriate to discuss the previous technical status of this aircraft ’ while it was subject to an @entity251 probe			1
however @entity16 did not deny the testimony of witnesses on that flight made to the @entity25			2
passengers at @entity18 's @entity258 have been forced to endure severe delays following the incident @entity16 cancelled all of its short haul flights until 4pm following the incident the airport has seen 188 cancellations , the vast majority of which were short haul flights the airport was seeing delays of 38 minutes for departures and 23 minutes for arrivals , on average , following the emergency landing @entity273 , @entity274 said : ' incidents like this are extremely rare but the team trains constantly to ensure we are prepared when they occur			1
' i ’d like to thank the fire and airside team , emergency services and @entity16 for their calm professionalism in assisting passengers and making the aircraft safe			1
' we were able to reopen the northern runway within two hours of the incident and we are now focused on returning the airport to normal as quickly as possible			0
' captain @entity290 , chairman of airline pilots ’ association @entity292 , said : ' this was a professional job done by professional people			0
as pilots we spend our whole career training to manage incidents such as this in order to avoid an incident becoming a disaster			0
' @entity292 representatives will be assisting the pilots involved in this incident and providing whatever support they need			0
and , as always , we will all learn whatever lessons we can			0
' the plane was surrounded by emergency vehicles after it made the emergency landing this morning the plane had been due to fly to @entity83 and had been carrying 75 passengers , @entity16 has said passengers at @entity18 have been warned to expect delays of 30 to 60 minutes following the emergency landing the airport has said all of the passengers were ' safely evacuated ' and ' accounted for ' the plane with emergency services surrounding it after it landed at @entity18 this morning an engine fire is the most serious incident air pilots face but also the one for which they practice the most			1
today 's successful landing of the stricken @entity16 plane was another example of just how well cockpit crews deal with such events , said @entity226 , operations and safety editor of flight global publication			1
he added that air accident investigators will have ' a pretty shrewd idea ' almost straightaway about what happened			0
if the plane ran into a large bird or a flock of birds , as has been speculated , then the evidence would be obvious , mr @entity226 said			2
he went on : ' the @entity16 pilots today would have got some kind of mechanical damage which led to some kind of fire			1
' this is the most serious event you can have , but engine failure that leads to a fire is the emergency for which crews practice more than any other event			1
' if you do n't deal with events like this quickly and effectively then it is disastrous			0
thankfully , in nearly every case pilots take appropriate action			0
' in such incidents , pilots go through an engine shutdown drill , with a two - engined plane such as the @entity92 involved in today 's incident perfectly capable of flying on one engine			2
the crew cut off the fuel to the stricken engine and if the fire does not go out they push buttons or pull handles to activate the fire extinguisher system which is in the engine itself			0
mr @entity226 said : ' crews get retrained twice a year			0
one thing that happens in every single simulation exercise is engine fire incident			1
' he said the simulation exercise would often involve an engine fire at the two most critical times - at take - off or landing			1
@entity18 and other airports employ bird - scaring tactics but mr @entity226 said that airports are powerless to cope with , say , a flock of geese which may decide to fly over an airport			0
he went on : ' if planes fly into a flock of birds or a large one such as an adult @entity394 goose , then engine blades can break up and get ingested into the engine			0

@entity399 @entity16 plane was forced to make an emergency landing
all 75 passengers were evacuated safely and accounted for
passenger has described moment flames were seen coming from the engine
eyewitnesses have described hearing ' a blowout ' and seeing engine on fire
pictures from inside aircraft show *inspection* cover loose on port engine
aviation experts say ' damage is *consistent* with a bird strike '
