' out of 92 professional league clubs , there are currently only two black managers			2
' @entity92 was often held up as ' an arena in which barriers have been broken ' but the mp said : ' we rightly cheer the success of our many black footballers ... but take a look off the pitch , where a lot of power is wielded , and you see a different story			0
' television and newspapers also failed to reflect their audience , he said , pointing out that @entity108 , the editor of the @entity109 , is currently the only @entity110 journalist to run a newspaper			0
