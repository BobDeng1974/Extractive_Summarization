by @entity0 a lack of empathy is a common trait among psychopaths , but the complex nature of the emotion has baffled scientists for years			1
now , researchers from @entity9 have not only mapped the areas of the brain affected when we experience feelings of empathy - they ’ve also found a way to increase it			1
using a combination of brain scans and emotional feedback techniques , they were able to help participants focus on , and develop , feelings of affection and tenderness			1
researchers from @entity9 have mapped the areas of the brain affected when we experience feelings of empathy , pictured			1
using these patterns , and a combination of brain scans and emotional feedback techniques , they were able to help participants develop feelings of affection and tenderness it is the first time empathetic feelings across the whole brain have been identified using scans			1
previous studies have only focused on single brain regions related to specific emotions			1
the @entity37 - @entity36 machine was originally referenced in @entity39 's novel @entity38 ?			0
it later appeared , known as the @entity41 - @entity36 machine , in the 1982 screen adpatation of the book , called @entity44			0
the @entity45 is a fictional polygraph - style machine used in the book and film to determine if someone is human , or an android replicant			0
it measures reactions , including respiration , heart rate and eye movement , in response to emotionally provocative questions			0
it is an advanced form of lie detector that measures contractions of the iris muscle and the presence of invisible airborne particles emitted from the body			0
the machine is often called an empathy - detector because feelings of empathy separate humans from androids			2
in @entity72 's 1982 film @entity44 , based on @entity39 ’s science fiction book @entity38 ? ' , a similar empathy - detection device were used to measure tenderness or affection felt towards others			2
called the @entity41 - @entity36 machine , it was used to distinguish humans from replicants , or androids			0
to map empathetic feelings , the @entity9 team began by scanning the brains of 25 participants while asking them emotionally - charged questions			1
each participant was asked to identify a memory that was important to them , in which they felt feelings of empathy			2
they were also asked to think of a time they felt proud , and to have ‘ neutral ’ thoughts without any emotion			1
professor @entity96 , from the @entity97 in @entity98 , then used computer software to identify patterns in the brain activity linked to each of these emotions			1
in the 1982 film @entity44 , based on @entity39 's book @entity38 ? ' , a similar empathy - detection device was used to measure tenderness or affection felt towards others			2
called the @entity41 - @entity36 machine , pictured with @entity110 as @entity111 , it is used to distinguish humans from replicants empathy is the ability to understand or imagine the depth of another person 's feelings			2
it differs from sympathy , which implies pity but felt without considering the other person 's feelings			0
empathy comes from the @entity125 term @entity124 , meaning to ' feel as one with '			0
it implies feeling with a person , rather than feeling sorry for a person			0
once the software was trained to pick up on these patterns , the volunteers were asked to control and hold these thoughts and feelings			1
during tests , each participant was shown a blurry image			0
@entity138 then gave each person feedback about how strong their emotion was , based on the real - time brain scans and activity			1
the more successfully each participant held and developed their feelings of empathy , the clearer the image became			0
the people who were given feedback on their brain patterns were able to strengthen them , @entity138 ’s team reports in the @entity151 journal @entity148			1
‘ this demonstrates that humans can voluntarily enhance brain signatures of tenderness and affection , unlocking new possibilities for promoting prosocial emotions and countering antisocial behavior , ’ they wrote			2
@entity138 stressed that the technique needs further work before it can be used to help people with personality disorders and developmental conditions , such as autism			0
a follow - up experiment will also look at how the brains of psychopaths differ .			0

@entity9 researchers mapped the brains of 25 participants
they used brain scanners to detect patterns of activity created by empathy
it is the first time the complex emotions of the feeling have been *plotted*
once they *'d* established a pattern , they asked people to hold the emotion
scans revealed it is possible to teach your brain to be more *altruistic*
