a tooth belonging to a @entity1 – an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago - has been re-discovered after being lost for decades			1
it was found in one of 40 forgotten boxes at the @entity6 at @entity7 , @entity8 , allowing scientists to re-examine it using modern techniques			1
from wear - and - tear on the canine tooth , they say that the individual it belonged to was quite old when she died and probably gnawed on bones and crunched on hard nuts			1
a tooth belonging to the @entity1 – an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago - has been re-discovered after being lost for decades in an unopened box in a museum fossils , including a number of teeth , were found in caves in @entity26 near @entity27 in the 1920s , but most of the pieces were lost in the chaos of @entity32			1
the tooth surfaced in 2011 in a box that had never been unpacked or studied since it was shipped from @entity35 in the 1920s			1
the tooth indicates that @entity1 ( a bust is pictured ) gnawed on bones and ate nuts two @entity35 palaeontologists , @entity42 and @entity43 from the @entity44 and @entity45 ( @entity46 ) in @entity27 have now examined the tooth and it has at last been described in the journal @entity49			1
they quickly determined that it was a canine tooth from a @entity1			1
‘ it is a spectacular find , ’ said @entity51 , who was one of the team who came across it in the box			0
‘ we can see numerous details that tell us about this individual ’s life			0
‘ the crown of the tooth is relatively small , which indicates that it belonged to a woman			1
‘ the tooth is quite worn , so the individual must have been quite old when she died			1
‘ in addition , two large chips have been knocked out of the enamel , as if hit by something , or perhaps by biting into something really hard such as a bone or a hard nut			0
‘ at least one of the chips was old when the individual died , since it is partly worn down			2
’ dr @entity51 told @entity76 the woman may have been between 30 and 40 years old when she died , which was a ripe age at the time			1
previous studied have shown that the @entity1 used fire to stay warm and wore animal hides			2
the very first samples of the prehistoric ancestor were found by @entity84 from @entity7 in the 1920s and are on show alongside a third tooth discovered in the 1950s , at the museum			1
it became a world sensation in 1927 when crania and other bones were found at the site by @entity94 of the @entity95 of @entity35 and @entity97 @entity96 , who had taken over the excavations			2
@entity1 , an ancient human ancestor lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago			1
the name describes the species , not an individual and around 15 partial crania have been found			2
examination of a tooth now shows that the species ate nuts and meat with wear and tear indicating he gnawed on bones			1
in order to survive the harsh weather , @entity1 would have needed to be able to create and manage fire , and now there is solid proof to back this theory in the form of soil samples			2
it 's thought the @entity1 wore animal hides that had been softened using stone tools			0
belonging to the species @entity122 , the @entity1 was also able to make bizarrely drilled holed objects , but it is not understood why			2
fossils , including a number of teeth , were found in caves in @entity26 ( marked on the map with an @entity131 ) near @entity27 in the 1920s , but most of the pieces were lost in the chaos of @entity32 the @entity1 became a world sensation in 1927 when crania ( pictured ) and other bones were found at the site by @entity94 of the @entity95 of @entity35 and @entity97 @entity96 sadly , the unique collection disappeared during the chaos of the @entity32 and has never been found since , but over the last decades , several fossils of @entity122 have been found in other parts of the world			1
’ ‘ we now know that the species is a direct ancestor to the modern man			0
‘ however , the lost materials of the @entity1 remain one of palaeontology ’s greatest mysteries and most tragic losses ’ , said dr @entity51			2
archaeologists first arrived in @entity26 in 1921 where they were directed to the site by quarrymen			0
first , human teeth were found at the site but it was @entity97 scientist @entity96 who made some of the most significant discoveries , including a skull , despite his initial findings being treated with scepticism by scientists around the world			0
around 200 fossils were gathered until excavation came to an end in 1937 with the @entity170 invasion			0
sadly , the vast majority of the finds disappeared during the chaos of the @entity32 and have never been found since , making the discovery of the tooth especially important fossils were placed in the @entity177 of the @entity178 for safe - keeping , before being packed up for the @entity179 in 1941			0
but the fossils were inexplicably lost as they were being transported through northern @entity35			0
it is still unknown what happened to the fossils with some believing they sank on @entity170 ship the @entity186 in 1945			0
@entity179 financier @entity187 appealed for information on their whereabouts in 1972 , promising a reward of $ 5,000			0
one woman made contact , demanding $ 500,000 , but nothing ever came of the approach			0
the @entity35 government also initiated a committee to locate the fossils to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the end of @entity202 fossils , however , have yet to be located .			0

tooth was found in a box at the @entity6 at @entity7
@entity207 was found in the 1920s but has been lost for decades
it belonged to an ancient human ancestor some 500,000 years ago
@entity1 is the name of the species , not an individual
wear and tear indicates person gnawed on bones and crunched hard nuts
canine tooth belonged to a woman who was quite old when she died
