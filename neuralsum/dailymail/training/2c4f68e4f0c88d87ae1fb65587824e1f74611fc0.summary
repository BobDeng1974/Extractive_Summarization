by @entity0 published : 15:18 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 15:19 est , 6 august 2013 in 18 states , there were at least slight declines in obesity for low - income preschoolers childhood obesity rates in 18 @entity9 states have declined for the first time in decades , according to a new government report released today			1
it 's the first evidence of a national decline in childhood obesity , in a report that targeted low - income preschoolers across 40 states			1
previous national statistics show obesity rates have been rising for decades and recently were essentially flat , although some places have reported improvements , like @entity22 and @entity23 and the state of @entity25			1
but the report from the @entity27 shows signs of a wider - ranging improvement			2
' now , for the first time , we 're seeing a significant decrease in childhood obesity ' nationally , said dr. @entity34 , @entity35 director			2
still , one in eight preschoolers are obese in the @entity9 , and it 's even more common in black and @entity39 kids			2
preschoolers who are overweight or obese are five times more likely than other children to be heavy as adults , which means greater risks of high cholesterol , high blood sugar , asthma and even mental health problems			0
the new study 's data comes from measurements of the height and weight of nearly 12 million low - income children in 40 states			1
the children were ages two , three and four			0
most were enrolled in the @entity59 ( @entity61 ) program which provides food vouchers and other services			0
it 's harder to get national data on preschoolers of more affluent families , so it 's not clear if the trend applies to all young children			2
but experts note that low - income kids tend to be heavier			1
' if you 're going to look at the problem of obesity early in childhood , the group at highest risk are low - income kids			1
' that 's what makes this data so valuable for understanding trends in this major public health problem , ' said dr. @entity85 , a @entity86 researcher who tracks health policy and children 's health issues			2
source : @entity91 , 2008 - 2011			2
* represents statistically significant annual decrease or increase in obesity the biggest declines were in @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			1
each saw their obesity numbers fall at least 1 percentage point			0
despite the improvements , the numbers are still disappointing			0
@entity106 was the best , with about 9 percent of low - income preschoolers estimated to be obese in 2011			0
@entity108 was worst , at nearly 17 percent			0
ten states were not included ; some had changed how they track height and weight			0
one of the missing states is @entity114 , which has one of the largest populations of low - income children and is known to have a significant problem with childhood obesity			1
of the remaining 40 states , 18 showed at least slight improvement and 19 had no significant change			0
three – @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 – increased			1
the last @entity35 study to look at childhood obesity data this way found very different results			0
from 2003 to 2008 , significant declines in preschooler obesity were seen in only nine states and increases were seen in 24 states			1
' we 're seeing great progress , ; said the @entity35 's @entity137 , lead author of the new study			0
the report did n't answer why some states improved while most others held steady , and @entity85 said there 's a pressing need to do more research and understand how some states achieved success			1
@entity35 officials said a change in @entity61 policies probably played a major role			0
the changes – instituted in 2009 – eliminated juice from infant food packages , provided less saturated fat , and made it easier to buy fruits and vegetables			0
breast - feeding rates have been increasing , and kid 's raised on mother 's milk tend to have lower obesity rates , experts said .			1

the biggest declines were in @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100
three states increased - @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125
breast - feeding rates have been increasing , and kid 's raised on mother 's milk tend to have lower obesity rates
