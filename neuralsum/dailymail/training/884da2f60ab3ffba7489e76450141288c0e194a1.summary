by @entity0 published : 14:35 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 10:22 est , 6 december 2013 tragic : @entity1 with her husband @entity2 before he died @entity1 and her husband dreamt of having two children – a boy and a girl			1
but he died of cancer before they could start a family and she has launched a legal battle to give her the chance of realising the dream			2
mrs @entity1 , 28 , wants more time to decide whether to have ivf treatment using sperm that her husband had frozen before his death			1
the couple had been together eight years and married in a hospice six weeks before @entity19 , a ski instructor , died from a brain tumour aged just 32			1
he had agreed that the samples could be used to allow his wife to have their child after his death but , under the law , the samples will be destroyed within months			0
mrs @entity1 admits she may never be ready to have her late husband ’s child			1
but she needs more time to decide whether to have a baby who will never meet its father			2
she is not only grieving for her husband , but also her brother , @entity32 , a policeman who was killed in a car crash just weeks before mr @entity19 ’s death in february 2012			1
mrs @entity1 , who took her husband ’s @entity36 name as her surname after his death , wants to be financially secure before bringing a child into the world			1
the physiotherapist from @entity42 said : ‘ i am still trying to make myself happy again – you do n’t have a child because you are lonely and heartbroken			1
i need to make myself whole again			0
i want to be financially settled as well , so that my child can have everything i had			0
i am just a normal person who loved someone very , very much and lost them			0
’ widow : @entity1 , 28 , has been told by the @entity51 that the sperm can not be stored beyond april 2015 after falling ill just ten months into their relationship , mr @entity19 stored samples of sperm ahead of gruelling cancer treatment that could leave him infertile			1
the storage was time - limited and , over the years , he regularly extended it			2
he also explicitly agreed to the samples being used after his death			0
now , unless the storage period can be extended , the samples will be destroyed in april 2015			1
this gives mrs @entity1 little time to get over her grief			1
or to have @entity67 , a stressful and invasive process that may have to be undergone several times			0
and even if she did have a baby soon , the samples would be destroyed before she could use them to have the equally longed - for second child			0
in a case that will reignite the debate over the ethics of posthumous conception , mrs @entity1 is asking the @entity77 for the storage period to be extended			2
her solicitor @entity79 said that her right to use the sperm in @entity67 is not in dispute			0
the legal issue is how long it can be stored for			0
the lawyer , whose firm is not charging for its work , said : ‘ she would like to be able to make the decision when she is ready			0
’ the fertility watchdog , the @entity88 , said that it had ‘ every sympathy ’ with mrs @entity1			1
however , the storage period can not be extended without her husband ’s consent			0
mrs @entity1 , who put her studies and career on hold to care for her dying husband , said : ‘ we just fell head over heels in love			1
it was a long time ago that we made plans that when we are engaged and married we would have children			2
‘ ideally we ’d have a boy and a girl and we talked about names			0
i am just trying to do the right thing			0
’ mrs @entity1 added : ‘ ‘ i have the full support of @entity2 ’s family in my legal battle and in whatever decision i make , and they have told me how proud they are of how i am dealing with the situation			2

@entity1 , 28 , from @entity42 said she needs more time to think
her husband , @entity19 , died from a brain tumour in 2012
the couple got married in a hospice six weeks before he passed away
his sperm was stored before he underwent *radiotherapy* treatment in 2005
but fertility regulator has said the sample can not be stored past april 2015
