renewable energy firm @entity6 wants to put 135,000 solar panels on farmland near the village of @entity10			2
it would cover an area six times bigger than the @entity3 ’s second largest solar power project			1
the renewable electricity firm has not yet submitted a planning application for the project but has held discussions with @entity17 about its plans			1
big plan : renewable energy firm @entity6 wants to put 135,000 solar panels on farmland near the village of @entity10			2
pictured , photovoltaic celss in @entity21 , @entity22 if approved , the solar farm could generate between 25 and 30 megawatts of electricity			0
@entity25 , 81 , who lives near the site , said : ‘ people always say they want this energy , but to me it is taking a hell of a lot of farmland away			0
’ @entity3 ’s second biggest project is at @entity34 , near @entity35 in @entity36 , which was approved last month			1
it will cover 37 acres and have 28,000 photovoltaic panels			0
@entity6 , which owns and operates @entity39 - the @entity3 ’s first commercial wind farm - is currently in the ' early stages ' of the planning process			1
the firm has requested a ' scoping opinion ' from @entity17 , which will determine the extent of a required environmental impact assessment			2
in documents submitted to the council , the firm confirmed : ' the total optioned landholding comprises 372 hectares ( 919 acres ) of land made up of five separate farms			0
progress : good energy owns and operates @entity39 - the @entity3 's first commercial wind farm ' of this land , 15 fields belonging to four landowners with a combined area of 91 hectares ( 224 acres ) have been identified as suitable for solar photovoltaic development			1
' but @entity61 , 52 , who lives close to the proposed site in the tiny @entity5 town of @entity10 , slammed the plans			0
he said : ' it is about time all these things were not called farms , they should be called factories or power stations			0
' i think it is a bit too much , it is all around the area the whole time now and it has turned into a joke			0
' it is a large size and i think it is going to be about five square miles which is just not good for the area			0
' there are already 12 solar farms and 24 more have permission in @entity17 , with the largest having capacity of around 5mw , enough to supply around 1,000 homes			1
@entity85 , manager of @entity17 ’s natural resources planning team , has said several firms had shown an interest in building solar farms of 20 to 30mw capacity .			2
