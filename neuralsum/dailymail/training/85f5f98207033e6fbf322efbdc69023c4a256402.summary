demonstration : the @entity37 protest is causing a ' risk to the life of the cathedral ' , cathedral officials have warned open on a reduced basis : the cathedral - one of the capital 's most popular tourist attractions - has already had to close the restaurant and gift shop protest : demonstrators have set up camp in the square outside @entity5 , promising to occupy the site indefinitely so unusual is the potential closure that not even staff at @entity5 's were able to confirm if or when it had happened before , when asked by @entity53			1
numbers of protestors who have set up camp as part of the @entity37 demonstration have been growing since the makeshift protest camp was set up on saturday			1

iconic : this image of @entity89 has become a symbol of survival ... but the house of worship could face temporary closure due to the growing number of protestors ' the increased scale and nature of the protest camp is such that to act safely and responsibly the cathedral must now review the extent to which it can remain open for the many thousands coming this week as worshippers , visitors and in school parties			1
