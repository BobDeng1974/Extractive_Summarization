by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 11:49 est , 30 july 2013 one of the most glaring errors in @entity2 - if you move past the minor technicality that various species of dinosaurs were brought back from extinction - is that the mosquito caught inside the famous amber sample is a fraud			1
in the film , blood contained in the gut of the mosquito is extracted by @entity16 's character @entity15 and spliced with frog dna to kick off the dinosaur cloning process			1
however , entomologists have now claimed that the particular mosquito used in the film is the only species that does n't suck blood at all - making the extraction of the dino dna impossible			1
in the film @entity2 , blood is extracted from a prehistoric mosquito encased in a preserved piece of amber by @entity16 , pictured			1
this one action sets up the entire film , but experts have now claimed this to be impossible - mainly because the mosquito used is the only species that does n't suck blood at all toxorhynchites are also known as ' elephant mosquitos			1
they the largest known species of mosquito			2
they also make up the only species that do not suck blood			1
instead , adult t. rutiluss feed from honeydew , sap , nectar and fruit			0
most species live in forests			2
retired entomologist @entity53 told @entity54 that mosquitoes were around during the time of the dinosaurs , dating back 170 million years , and would have ultimately fed on their blood			0
yet , not the one @entity59 used in the 1993 film			0
@entity53 said : ' unfortunately , the species portrayed in @entity2 - @entity63 rutilus - does n't feed on blood			1
it 's actually the only type of mosquito that does n't			2
' the mosquito in the film is also shown with a hairy antennae , suggesting it is a male @entity71 rutilus			2
this further boosts @entity53 's claims			0
only females of blood - sucking mosquito species sucks blood			1
thirdly , the movie shows the mosquito being found in the @entity79 , yet that region has never produced fossils dating back that far			0
@entity59 is believed to have chosen the @entity71 rutilus because it is the largest species of mosquito known to man - so big it has been dubbed ' elephant mosquito ' - and this would have made it easier to film			1
this does n't mean the concept of a real - life @entity2 should be completely disregarded , though			0
scientists spliced the blood extracted from the mosquito with frog @entity94 to clone the dinosaurs seen in all three @entity2 films			2
lead character dr @entity98 , played by @entity99 , is pictured in a scene from @entity101 ( 2001 ) last year , perfectly preserved cells from a woolly mammoth were found in @entity104 , bringing closer the prospect of a cloned comeback for the iconic tusked creature			0
an international team of researchers discovered the unique material in a permafrost mammoth graveyard in remote @entity112 , in the east of @entity114			0
the find included '' soft , fatty tissue , hair , bone marrow of the mammoth ' , said the @entity120 , director of the @entity121 at the @entity122 in @entity123 , who led the expedition			0
the sample is now on display in @entity127 , and scientists are looking at ways in which they could bring the animal back from extinction .			0

expert claims the mosquito preserved in amber is a @entity63 rutilus
it is the only species of mosquito that does n't suck blood
this makes extracting dinosaur dna from the insect impossible
