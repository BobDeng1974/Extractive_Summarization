the ex-professional footballers who planted a pompous flag in the moral high ground this weekend made me laugh			0
some of them claim they never dived or went over easy in their careers but you can guarantee when they were playing they all appealed for a free - kick or a penalty they knew for certain was n't theirs			1
there are levels of cheating , or trying to con the ref , and some may well be seen as worse than others			0
@entity16 midfielder @entity15 goes down during his side 's 2 - 1 win against @entity19 on saturday @entity15 dived and won a free - kick after @entity19 captain @entity21 ( right ) avoided contact with him but the reaction to @entity15 's dive has been totally over the top , and some well - respected football pundits need to have a broader view of the modern game - and not just throw in cliches because they know it pleases the public			1
@entity15 went down without being touched , got straight up , did n't appeal for anything , and carried on playing			1
the referee @entity33 blew his whistle for a foul on the @entity16 player			2
so what exactly did @entity15 do wrong ? those football observers in this country who have an unhealthy obsession with eradicating diving from the game will focus more on young talented @entity44 players , and they do n't deserve it			1
it 's all very worthy , but all so very unrealistic as well			0
for a start , @entity15 does not have a reputation for cheating			0
so why pick on him after one incident ? @entity15 , pictured with @entity19 's @entity51 , is one of the most skilful players in the @entity53 referee @entity33 awarded @entity16 a free - kick after @entity15 's first - half dive secondly , some top players with a reputation for diving – @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and even in the past , @entity62 – are footballers who like to have the ball at their feet and run with it			1
defenders kicked them more than they kicked the ball			0
why wait to be hacked down ? if you 're a skilful player who can skip a tackle , why stay on your feet and wait for your ankle to get smashed if you can avoid the potential injury and go down for a free - kick ? @entity15 is a player who runs with the ball – a rare breed from this country and we should be protecting him			1
he 's not a baby , he will have to put up with knocks , kicks and bumps			0
but there 's a limit			0
of course @entity21 did n't even make a challenge on saturday in that incident , but @entity15 has every right to protect himself			2
@entity90 star @entity59 ( left ) has a reputation for going down easily when challenged @entity92 's @entity61 has been accused of diving to win free - kicks and penalties during his career @entity16 fans will remember a foul from @entity21 that caused an injury to @entity100 , then a toffee , which robbed the @entity102 international of his chance of playing in the 2009 fa cup final			1
in fact it was such a bad foul @entity100 sued for loss of earnings			0
the case was settled out of court , @entity100 receiving a six - figure sum			0
@entity113 is spot - on when he said after the game that @entity15 had every right to ' expect contact			1
' diving is n't something that should be taught or encouraged but it is very much a part of the global game of football and it 's about time @entity123 faced that reality and got cuter in their approach			2
i do n't want to win a fair - play trophy , i want to win a real one			2
if @entity15 is kicked all over the pitch in the final game of the season , and then decides he 's had enough so he dives for a penalty to secure @entity16 a top - four place in the final minute , the same high - principled ex-players - turned - pundits will be wailing and weeping			1
it makes you wonder if they 've ever played the game			0
this challenge from @entity21 ( right ) left then @entity16 striker @entity100 seriously injured in february 2009			2

@entity15 dived to win a free - kick in @entity16 's win against @entity19
but he did n't appeal for a foul and got up immediately to play on
many of the game 's most skilful players go down to avoid getting injured
some ex-professionals act as if they never attempted to con officials
