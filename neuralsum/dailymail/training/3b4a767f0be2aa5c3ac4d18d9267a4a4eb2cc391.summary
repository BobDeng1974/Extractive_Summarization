with a wealth of personal connections to the country and a sense of @entity9 identity ‘ rooted ' in her psyche , @entity1 's latest series for @entity2 was always going to be an emotional affair			1
in a touching scene from the first episode of @entity1 ’s @entity15 , the presenter is shown sampling some frittelle - a type of @entity18 doughnut , which her late grandmother often used to make			1
one bite is enough to transport her back to her nonna ’s kitchen and tears well up in her eyes			0
‘ she was an amazing cook and i ’m really sad that i did n’t take more advantage at the time			0
coming back here has reminded me just how much this city means to me ’ , she says			0
sail away : @entity1 reveals how visitors to @entity18 can escape the crowds on the city 's famous waterways taste of the good life : @entity1 travelled to @entity38 to visit a famous cheese - making business all four of @entity1 ’s grandparents were @entity9 and she considers the show to be a homage to her family and the regions they came from			1
it ’s a heartfelt love letter to the country - one that is littered with superlatives and will have viewers researching their next trip as soon as the credits roll			1
@entity1 , who is best known to viewers as @entity55 , admits that @entity9 is a ‘ well - trodden path ’ but most of the locations that feature in the programme have some sort of personal significance , including the hillside village of @entity62 , which was her late grandfather ’s home , and the @entity65 , which she visited on her honeymoon			1
by ‘ secret ’ she means the side of the country that tourists usually do n’t get to see , including lace - making on the island of @entity75 , a family cheese - making business in @entity38 and a women ’s prison that makes toiletries for luxury hotels			1
going back to her roots : the presenter has a strong connection with @entity18 and has visited more than 40 times her grand tour starts on friday with a visit to @entity18 , which is ‘ achingly , achingly beautiful ’ and gives her ‘ shivers to be back ’			1
the city , she asserts , is one of the wonders of the world and stirs up further emotion : ‘ i feel tearful of the beauty of it , it takes my breath away			0
it ’s places like @entity18 that marks us out as a civilised world and it makes me sad because i do n’t think we ’re creating anything these days that is as impressive			1
’ it ’s a city that @entity1 knows well : her grandmother , who died five years ago , was @entity18 and her mother ’s best friend still lives there			1
she has visited at least 40 times but admits that , while there ’s much to love , there is one thing that detracts : the crowds of tourists			1
‘ @entity18 has become so touristy and it is so crowded , it can be really off - putting ’ , she says			1
‘ lots of people go to @entity18 with a kind of ‘ tick box ’ mentality , you know , ‘ must see the @entity114 , must go over @entity115 , must , must ’			1
and actually , they are so busy doing that that they do n’t really take time to look around			0
’ making a splash : the crew are pictured filming on @entity18 's famous waterways for the new series escaping the crowds : @entity1 got up very early in the morning to avoid the tourists at @entity18 's @entity131 like many people , @entity1 is not a fan of the big cruise ships that sail into @entity135 , which she says dwarf @entity18 and do n’t add enough to the local economy : ‘ people come off with a packed lunch and a bottle of water			1
they might buy a coffee but that ’s all they buy and then they throng the streets like some mad , baying pack all with the same list of things to see			2
' it makes it a pretty miserable experience really			0
i would say that between the hours of 10am and 6pm central @entity18 is pretty impassable			2
’ but , @entity1 claims , escaping the tourist hordes is n’t all that difficult : one way is to get up very early in the morning or go out late at night			2
in the show , she heads to @entity154 in the heart of the city at day break and has only early morning joggers and sweet sweepers for company : ‘ it feels as if it is a stage set , it is so beautiful			2
’ at a deserted @entity131 she realises it ’s the first time in years that she has n't had to fight her way through ‘ six layers of tourists with cameras ’			1
taste of local life : in @entity38 , @entity1 met a family that had been making their famous cheese for generations sweet treat : the series also gave @entity1 the chance to sample some of the cakes she used to eat as a child another of @entity1 ’s tips is to get the number one water bus - or vaporetto - which takes you all the way up the @entity186 : ‘ instead of spending € 80 for 40 minutes in a gondola you get to actually travel in comfort and see these amazing palazzi			1
it ’s really exciting how beautiful everything is			2
’ another drawback to the city is just how expensive it is			0
@entity1 takes the cameras into the @entity196 ’s opulent @entity195 , which once hosted @entity197 and @entity198 and costs a regal € 15,000 a night			2
and the world got a glimpse of how extravagant life in the city could be when @entity202 married @entity203 at the seven - star @entity204 last month			0
‘ i know the @entity206 and it is unbelievably beautiful , it really is ’ , @entity1 says			1
‘ but i think what ’s sad in @entity18 , even to stay somewhere really pretty nasty costs € 250 to € 300 a night			1
there ’s not much option			0
you either stay on the mainland and come in very early in the morning or you come on a cruise ship			0
otherwise , most people just ca n’t afford it			0
‘ every time we go i ’m just astonished at how expensive it is			0
it ’s the only place in the world that my husband has ever refused to let me touch the mini bar			0
it ’s € 10 for 30ml of coke , it ’s really ridiculous			0
’ fashionable destination : @entity1 headed to @entity225 to discover what makes the city so chic rising to the occasion : @entity1 discovered how to make the perfect panettone in @entity225 another highlight of the series for @entity1 was returning to @entity232 , where she lived for three years in her twenties			2
her father , count @entity235 ( he was killed in a car accident when @entity1 was nine ) , was @entity238 and his family still live there			0
@entity1 lived with her boyfriend in the city ’s @entity241 which she says felt like a little village and boasts the best ice cream in @entity232			2
the quarter also has one of the city ’s oldest bakeries , which is known for its excellent kosher cakes and infamous customer service			0
@entity251 is run by three formidable sisters and is so famous it does n’t need a name above the door			0
but service comes without a smile : ‘ when i lived there i visited this shop almost every day and every time it was like the first time they had ever seen me ’ , laughs @entity1			1
even in front of the camera , the ladies remain poker - faced			0
her guide , @entity266 explains : ‘ they pretend they are annoyed but inside they love it			0
’ @entity1 cut her teeth as a restaurant manager working for her uncle at the city ’s @entity274 , which is owned by @entity276 ( @entity1 ’s grandfather was @entity278 who founded the @entity280 )			1
the hotel boasts a spectacular garden , which @entity1 describes as a ‘ secret oasis of calm ’ and which the artist @entity285 at one time treated like his ‘ own @entity238 living room ’			1
‘ it ’s very special			0
as far as i know it ’s the only garden in a hotel in the whole of @entity232			0
anyone who is in @entity232 should go there for a drink just for a break from the frenetic pace of life ’ , @entity1 says			2
@entity1 at the @entity274 whose stunning garden ( right ) provides an ' oasis of calm ' in the centre of @entity232 keeping it in the family : @entity1 with her mother @entity304 in the @entity274 's stunning garden but her three yearsin @entity232 were n't a bed of roses and @entity1 describes the period as a ‘ very bittersweet time ’			1
‘ when i was growing up , i always felt very @entity9 when i was in @entity310 and very @entity310 when i was in @entity9			2
i thought i was going to put that to bed when i fell madly in love and moved to @entity9 full time ’ , she explains			1
‘ and i realised when i was in @entity9 that @entity310 is an amazing place to live in just because it has order , there are rules			2
i found the kind of chaos of the @entity9 systems completely overwhelming			0
i was happy to move back actually			0
’ famous bakery : @entity1 visited @entity251 in @entity232 with her guide @entity266 ( right ) @entity1 may not want to live in @entity9 but she returns to the country several times a year and is keen to introduce her two small children to their heritage			1
the show allowed her to spend more time in @entity328 , which she says people avoid because it is big , chaotic and associated with the mafia , but which she found to be fascinating			0
she also advises sunseekers to head to @entity335 if they want beautiful coastline : ‘ the @entity65 is very scenic but it ’s not the most beautiful sea in @entity9 by any means			1
’ but @entity55 reveals that even she made some bad choices when it came to accommodation : ‘ i 'm just like everyone else , when i was planning this trip i had to stick a pin in lots of hotels			2
i actually walked out of one hotel			0
they knew i had a one - and - a - half year old child and it had an unenclosed staircase in it			0
i could just see him falling to his death immediately ! ’ @entity1 ’s @entity15 is on fridays at 9pm on @entity2			1
