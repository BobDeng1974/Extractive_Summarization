by @entity0 published : 08:22 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 09:25 est , 1 march 2013 space probes have found a hitherto unknown third @entity3 radiation belt around @entity4 , which could help them understand how and when solar storms will wreak havoc on @entity4			1
the @entity3 radiation belts are donut - shaped rings of so - called ' killer electrons ' that encircle our planet			1
they can often swell dramatically in response to solar storms and other space weather , posing serious dangers to communications and gps satellites , as well as humans in space			1
scientists were able to observe the formation of the third belt , which persisted for four weeks before a powerful interplanetary shock wave from the @entity40 annihilated it			1
' after decades of studying the radiation belts , this was a completely new phenomenon , ' said @entity44 of the @entity45 , who is part of the team which operates the probes			1
' with the @entity51 ' instruments we now have the " eyes " capable of seeing such remarkable phenomena			2
' we look forward eagerly to the rest of the mission in order to establish how often such extreme radiation belt structures and dynamics may occur			2
' the @entity3 belts were the first major discovery of the @entity61			1
@entity62 sent back from @entity65 's @entity64 spacecraft , both launched in 1958 and both carrying instruments built by @entity3 , showed the presence of two distinct rings of high - energy electrons			1
at the time of their discovery , they were thought to be relatively stable structures , but subsequent observations have shown they are in fact dynamic and mysterious			0
a cutaway model of the radiation belts with the @entity3 probes flying through them : the radiation belts are two donut - shaped regions encircling @entity4 , containing high - energy particles , mostly electrons and ions on august 30 last year , @entity65 launched the @entity51 mission , later renamed the @entity51 mission , to learn more about the belts			1
they are known to be hazardous to satellites , astronauts and technological systems on @entity4 , so increasing our understanding of them is critical as societies become more reliant on space - based technology			1
a better understanding of belt formation , including the number of belts , will also help researchers refine their understanding of how and when solar storms can wreak havoc on @entity4			2
the discovery of the third belt came somewhat serendipitously , however , as the instrument which spotted it , the @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , was turned on earlier than originally planned			0
' it was a lucky decision , ' @entity65 said in a release			1
' shortly before @entity108 turned on , solar activity on the sun had sent energy toward @entity4 that caused the radiation belts to swell			2
' the data sent back to @entity4 from the @entity108 instruments during the month of september initially showed two @entity3 belts , as expected			1
but after a few days , the outer ring appeared to compress into an intense , tightly packed electron band and a third , less compact belt of electrons formed further out , creating a total of three rings			2
' by the fifth day @entity108 was on , we could plot out our observations and watch the formation of a third radiation belt , ' said @entity130 , deputy mission scientist for the @entity51			0
' we started wondering if there was something wrong with our instruments			0
we checked everything , but there was nothing wrong with them			0
the third belt persisted beautifully , day after day , week after week , for four weeks			0
' energetic electron data gathered by the probes : it shows three discrete energy channels			1
the third belt region and second slot are highlighted , and exist until a coronal mass ejection destroys them on october 1 @entity148 of the @entity149 , whose lab designed and built @entity108 , added : ' it was so odd looking , i thought there must be something wrong with the instrument			0
' but we saw things identically on each of the spacecraft			0
we had to come to the conclusion that this was real			0
' @entity44 , an astrophysicist at the @entity45 , principal investigator for the @entity159 , composition , and @entity162 instrument suite , of which @entity108 is a part , said it was a eureka moment			0
' we watched in amazement as the outer radiation belt disappeared rapidly , but not completely ; a small sliver of very energetic electrons remained at its inner edge , which we dubbed the " storage ring " , ' he said			2
' when the main outer electron belt reformed over subsequent days , it did so at a greater distance than where the storage ring was located , thus creating the transient , three - belt structure			0
' the textbook was being rewritten right before our eyes			0
' solar flare : on august 31 a giant prominence on the @entity40 erupted , sending out particles and a shock wave that traveled near @entity4			0
this event may have been one of the causes of the third radiation belt the middle ' storage ring ' persisted as the belt furthest away from @entity4 began to decay away in the third week of september , until , finally , a powerful interplanetary shockwave traveling from the sun virtually annihilated both the storage ring and the rest of the outer belt			0
scientists have known that the outer @entity3 belt can fluctuate wildly , at times swelling with charged particles before letting them slip away again , depending on space weather			1
however , this type of dynamic three - belt structure has never been seen before , or even theoretically considered			0
in the months since the storage belt and the outer belt virtually disappeared , the @entity3 radiation zones have re-formed into the originally expected two - belt structure			1
' we have no idea how often this sort of thing happens , ' said professor @entity148			0
' this may occur fairly frequently but we did n't have the tools to see it			0
' he added : ' this is the first time we have had such high - resolution instruments look at time , space and energy together in the outer belt			2
' previous observations of the outer radiation belt only resolved it as a single blurry element			0
when we turned @entity108 on just two days after launch , a powerful electron acceleration event was already in progress , and we clearly saw the new belt and new slot between it and the outer belt			0
' danger : the @entity3 belts known to be hazardous to satellites , astronauts and technological systems on @entity4 , so increasing understanding of them is critical as societies become more reliant on space - based technology the @entity51 are two identical spacecraft with a mission to map out the radiation belts , cataloguing the wide range of energies and particles , and tracking the zoo of magnetic waves that pulse through the area			1
the two probes , which are flying around @entity4 in an elliptical orbit , are able to send back observations for the first time from the heart of the two belts as each probe passes through			1
each carries an identical set of five instrument suites that allow scientists to gather data on the belts in unprecedented detail			1
the information sent back by the twin , octagonal spacecraft will help researchers better understand how space weather affects near - @entity4 phenomena by interacting with , feeding and stripping away the @entity3 belts			1
a better understanding of belt formation , including the number of belts , will help researchers refine their understanding of how and when solar storms can wreak havoc on @entity4			2
' these events we 've recorded are extraordinary and are already allowing us to refine and confirm our theories of belt dynamics in a way that will lead to predictability of their behavior , ' said professor @entity44			0
' [ that 's ] important for understanding space weather and ultimately for the safety of astronauts and spacecraft that operate within such a hazardous region of geospace			1
' the scientists detailed their findings in a paper published yesterday in the journal @entity295 .			2

@entity3 belts are donuts of electrons and ions that encircle our planet
first discovered in 1958 , scientists until now believed there were only two
@entity65 space probes sent to investigate the belts saw a third one forming
data could help us to understand how space weather affects our planet
