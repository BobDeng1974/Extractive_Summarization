the strict training methods championed by @entity11 in the 1970s and 1980s might even do more harm than good			0
trainer : when @entity2 famously ordered dog - owners to bark ' sit ! ' at their pets , they all obeyed , but new evidence suggests that a gentler approach might be better experts say efforts to gain the upper hand over a dog could cause it mental trauma and have an impact on its long - term welfare			1
a study claims pets that are trained using such ‘ aversive ’ techniques are far more likely to show symptoms of stress than those trained using more positive methods			2
it found that giving pets a treat as a reward for good behaviour and using a softer voice led to happier animals – and a better relationship with their owners			1
famous : mrs @entity2 , who died in 1988 at the age of 78 , became a household name with her tv series @entity45 the findings cast doubt on the widely used dog - training programme advocated by @entity11 , who claimed there were ‘ no bad dogs ’ – only bad owners who failed to assert themselves over their pets			1
the research , published in the @entity55 , involved monitoring two dog training schools working with a cross-section of breeds and ages			2
one relied primarily on ‘ negative reinforcement ’ , in which pets were encouraged to perform tasks using harsh tactics such as having their collar pulled			2
the other school involved ‘ positive reinforcement ’ , with dogs receiving treats or being petted , praised and played with when they obediently performed a task			2
the two groups were then observed undertaking simple tasks , such as being told to sit			0
sixty - five per cent of dogs trained using the negative reinforcement methods showed signs of stress – such as mouth - licking , shaking or whining – compared with just 8 per cent in the ‘ positive ’ group			0
dogs trained with rewards were also far more likely to gaze at their owner – a sign of a healthy relationship			0
dr @entity86 , from @entity87 in @entity88 , who led the study , told the @entity90 : ‘ what we noticed is that it was bad for the relationship to be trained “ negatively ”			1
‘ these dogs were more likely to show a lower posture and more signs of stress			0
’ but dr @entity98 , an animal psychologist and author of @entity100 , said relying on ‘ positive ’ training could lead to spoilt and badly behaved pets			0

new evidence suggests a gentler approach might be better for pets
experts in @entity88 say *attempting* to gain the upper hand over a dog may cause it mental trauma and impact on its long - term welfare
