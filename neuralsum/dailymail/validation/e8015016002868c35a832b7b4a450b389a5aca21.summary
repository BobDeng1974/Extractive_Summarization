children are suffering damage to their hearts as early as 12 due to poor diets , a study has warned			2
researchers found most people start life with robust heart health , but can lose it quickly through unhealthy eating habits			1
the @entity11 study showed few children under the age of 12 had an ideal diet and almost a third ( 30 per cent ) were overweight or even obese			1
the researchers said the better equipped children are to make healthy choices , the healthier their hearts will be in adulthood			1
study senior author @entity20 , professor and chair of preventive medicine at the @entity23 in @entity24 , said : ‘ our findings indicate that , in general , children start with pretty good blood pressure			2
they said few children under the age of 12 taking part had an ideal diet , and almost a third were overweight or even obese ( file picture posed by model ) ‘ but if they have a horrible diet , it will drive a worsening body mass index ( @entity43 ) and cholesterol levels			1
‘ the better we can equip our children to make healthy choices , the more cardiovascular health will be preserved into adulthood			1
‘ and those who preserve their heart health into middle age live much longer and are much healthier while they live			2
’ researchers examined @entity43 , healthy diet , total cholesterol and blood pressure – four of the seven components of heart health – in children aged two to 11			1
in the sample of 8,961 children , the researchers found that all children had at least one ideal measure , but none had all four			2
an ideal diet score was the least prevalent health indicator , with less than one per cent of children having four or five of the five components of a healthy diet			1
the experts warned people are losing a lot of ' intrinsic ' heart health very early in life , setting them up to be unhealthy adults the five indicators of a healthy diet include low intake of sugar - sweetened drinks and salt , and high intake of wholegrains , fish , plus fruit and vegetables			1
fewer than 10 per cent ate the recommended amounts of fruit and veg of more than 4.5 cups or more per day or fish , and wholegrains were the least frequently achieved component with just three per cent of boys and 2.4 per cent of girls hitting the target			0
ninety per cent ate more salt than recommended , and more than half consumed more than the recommended number of calories from sugar - sweetened drinks			0
around four out of ten of the children had ‘ poor ’ or ‘ intermediate ’ cholesterol levels , according to the findings published in the journal circulation : @entity110 and @entity111			0
researchers found ideal blood pressure was the most common favourable measure of cardiovascular health , ranging from 88 per cent to 93 per cent across sex and racial groups			0
previous studies have shown worsening indicators of cardiovascular health , starting in adolescence and continuing through adulthood			0
dr @entity20 added : ‘ we really need better surveillance data , especially in children			0
‘ information on physical activity , blood glucose and smoking or exposure to second - hand smoke are not available for younger children			0
‘ without knowing how much physical activity a child is doing , and therefore how many calories are needed , we ca n’t scale the diet metrics to a child ’s needs			0
‘ so we used the adult metrics , but understand that it would be difficult for a five - year - old to take in as many fruits and vegetables as an adult			0
‘ the bottom line is that we need even better data , but what we do see is that we are losing an awful lot of our intrinsic cardiovascular health very early in life , which sets us up to be unhealthy adults			2

most people start life with robust heart health , but can lose it quickly
@entity11 study showed few children under 12 had an ideal diet , third were obese
experts said the better equipped children are to make healthy choices , the healthier their hearts will be as adults
