before reading out the verdict , mr @entity42 said @entity0 had been brought to the tribunal by ambulance and had spent the past week in hospital after apparently being given the wrong medication			1
in a statement from @entity0 read out at the start of the court session , he rejected all the charges			2
@entity58 : he was accused of ordering the deaths of @entity10 civilians in @entity4 trial : the court can sit for only 90 minutes each day because of the defendant 's poor health ' i am innocent			0
i never killed , never stole			0
i served my country , ' said the statement read out by @entity0 's psychologist , who added that @entity0 said he returned to @entity8 from @entity46 in 1996 , ' because for him without @entity8 there is no life			1

@entity10 's war crime prosecutor and representatives of the @entity49 attended the session , leaving the courtroom after the verdict was announced			0
@entity98 , who brought @entity0 's case to light in 2006 , earlier described the proceedings as ' one of the last major trials ' of holocaust - era war criminal suspects			1
in 1941 , after the @entity107 occupation of @entity27 , @entity8 forces entered northern @entity10 , which sided with the @entity108 during the war and had been part of @entity8 until @entity111 in early 1942 , those @entity8 forces carried out raids to counter the growing number of partisan attacks			1

@entity142 today became the subject of a new investigation , which accuses him of guarding not only the @entity152 death camp , for which he has already been convicted , but also the @entity154 concentration camp			0
his case was the first time someone was convicted on evidence of being a guard alone , without evidence of a specific killing			0
