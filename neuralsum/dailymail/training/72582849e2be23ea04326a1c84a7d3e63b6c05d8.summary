' the @entity59 players , or those who have been here for many years , are more physically and mentally adapted and prepared to cope with the special incredible marathon of football we face			0
if you do it thinking , “ i should be having @entity5 with my family in @entity6 , @entity68 or @entity69 , ” you ca n’t do it			0
' if you do it with that perspective , then you ca n't do it because the mental aspect is the most important one			0

' the @entity9 boss added : ' @entity3 had a little holiday , with a @entity9 physio , for two weeks so even then he was working many hours per day with our physio			1
