however , he did not have any form of the disease , nor was there any medical evidence to suggest he did			2

i ’m going to have another breakdown			0
' @entity57 would not have survived without me and would have said it was her fault so i have sent her to heaven			0
we have lived together all our lives so we should die together			0
' the coroner heard that @entity6 who had two degrees from @entity64 , had been a keen traveller who ' lived life to the full ' and loved reading , films and going to the theatre			1
but he had taken extended leave from his job to care full - time for his mother , whose physical and mental health had ' rapidly deteriorated ' following the death of her oldest son @entity31 from cancer in 2012 aged 62			1
the death had rocked the family and led @entity37 to worry about the disease			2
he visited his gp but the doctor had diagnosed the disease sarcoidosis , where tissue on the organs becomes swollen			0
@entity85 's widow @entity84 said mrs @entity7 , a former shorthand typist , sandwich - maker and cleaner had struggled since her son 's death in september 2012 from leukaemia			1
scene : investigators were called to the house in @entity17 , @entity18 , which @entity6 shared with his mother ' she thought that she should have died instead of him , ' she said in a statement			1
' her health deteriorated and she became dependent on @entity6			1
she stopped going out on her own and spent more time at home			2
they had never been apart except from when @entity6 was at university			1
' when @entity31 died @entity6 took it upon himself to take a career break to look after her			2
@entity31 ’s death hit them both hard			2
' she deteriorated both physically and mentally			0

' the weapon used was discovered below @entity6			2
if there is no evidence of anybody else being involved - it can only be @entity6 who killed his mother			1
' officially i have got to record that @entity23 was unlawfully killed because she was murdered			1
@entity6 took his own life and i can be satisfied that he killed himself and killed his mother			1
' he might have been struggling with his mental health and had become preoccupied with his own health			0
' he at some point described he had cancer but he did n’t and as far as i could tell from records he was investigated and no - one was telling him he had cancer			0
' i suspect he did have some form of mental health problem			0
obviously that does not give him any right to try and harm anyone else , particularly his mother			0
he may have been doing so for in his mind trying to do the best he could for his mum but that is unlawful			0
