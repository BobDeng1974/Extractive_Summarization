@entity18 , right , is seen upset in the video ' having your child where you are at , when the next bands start coming out , they 're going to be even louder than what was already down there , okay ? ' the officer says to her in the video			1
' you 're child does n't have hearing protection on , ' he continues			2
' the crowd is going to start surging forward			0
where you 're at your child could get crushed , so we 're afraid of your child getting crushed and we 're afraid of your child 's eardrums being hurt , okay ? that is borderline , probably child endangerment			2
' you have two options , okay ? they can re-seat you somewhere else , they can put you in another seat where you can be safe , or you can get a refund on your tickets			0
it 's up to you ; it 's your call			0

' witness : @entity80 , pictured , claims the incident was about other concert - goers in the pit upset @entity18 was in public breastfeeding @entity18 tells police she wants her tickets refunded and turns down the offer to be moved to a different area			1
the officer tells @entity18 that if she refused to leave the pit , she would have been charged			2
he says they contacted the @entity92 - and that she can not receive officers ' badge numbers unless she identifies herself			0
she told @entity95 the incident ' was completely a cop - out			0
' ' they 're trying to cover this up because they know they legally can not remove me for nursing , ' she said			0
the statement from @entity17 police says officers spoke with @entity18 after security had already asked her to move and cited safety concerns			1
witness @entity80 , who also spoke to @entity95 , wrote on the @entity17 police @entity105 page ' i do n't know mom but i stood next to her for 2 hours and saw everything first hand - this is about breastfeeding ! ! they had no issue - security guard was 2 people down from her and never once said anything until breastfeeding which no one could see			1
5 girls tried to cut in front of her and when we all said no they texted a @entity124 security friend - then it became a breast feeding issue			0
