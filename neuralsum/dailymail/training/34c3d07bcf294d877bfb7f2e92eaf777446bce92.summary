from winking about a 67 - year - old sex worker to bringing back the budgie smugglers - it 's been a bumpy year for @entity3			1
the prime minister will mark his first 12 months in office this sunday on @entity6			0
and while it will be a cause for celebration , it also presents the opportunity to reflect on some of mr @entity3 's more memorable missteps since last year 's federal election			2
@entity3 prepares to deliver his victory speech before the party faithful perhaps appropriately mr @entity3 finds himself overseas at the moment , in @entity22 , for he has been lauded for his handling of some international affairs - particularly the tough stance taken with @entity26 over the @entity28 tragedy and most recently the humanitarian involvement in northern @entity30			1
but the former rugby union prop has also been guilty of dropping the ball at home and abroad			0
the list of faux pas ranges from winking when , during a radio interview , a pensioner told him she had to work on a sex line , to effectively telling the @entity40 to pull their heads in , as they seek independence			1
and yes , there was that rather awkward impromptu interview on morning television , in all his budgie smuggling glory			2
but it was when he took to the air - waves to discuss @entity52 matters with @entity53 , where the prime minister was truly exposed			2
one wink is all it took for the pm to be dragged into a public relations disaster when he seemed to make light of @entity53 the @entity63 's predicament she told how the planned $ 7 gp co-payment and increased cost of medication would leave her out of pocket up to $ 850 a year			1
' i would like to ask you if you 'd like your mother or your grandmother to be in my situation , ' she said			0
' i 'm a 67 - year - old pensioner with three chronic incurable medical conditions – two life - threatening			1
' i 'm just surviving on around $ 400 a fortnight once i pay my rent and i work on an adult sex line to make ends meet			1
that 's the only way i can do it			2
' it 's what mr @entity3 did on hearing @entity53 's phone sex admission that put his public standing in a spin - the prime minister clearly winking at radio show host @entity87			1
mr @entity3 has not only butted heads with battlers but the big names have also taken a shot at him			0
the claim he made a few years ago that climate change was ' absolute crap ' has come back to haunt him on an global scale			1
@entity98 actress @entity97 had a very clear message for the @entity101 prime minister on climate change , as she travelled through the @entity102 as part of a @entity105 campaign @entity107 actress @entity97 slammed the @entity54 for failing to act on climate change while travelling through the @entity102 as part of a @entity105 campaign			1
the @entity110 winner appeared in a photograph on a @entity105 ship near the @entity114 glacier , holding a sign which read : ' @entity3 climate change is real i 'm standing on it ! ' a second photograph featuring the 55 - year - old , saw her holding a second sign with the words : ' where i stand should be ice '			1
ahead of becoming prime minister , mr @entity3 had been prone to the most notably shrugging off the death of lance corporal @entity127 in @entity128 by suggesting to soldiers 's * * * happens ' and pointing out the ' sex appeal ' of female candidates			1
a noted monarchist , the pm won few friends in @entity40 last month when he said : ' as a friend of @entity107 , as an observer from afar , it 's hard to see how the world would be helped by an independent @entity40 '			2
the pro-independence @entity40 were having none of it , ahead of their september 18 poll			0
' @entity3 has a reputation for gaffes , but his bewildering comments have all the hallmarks of one of the @entity148 government 's international briefings against @entity40 , a spokesman for @entity40 first minister @entity150 said			2
' @entity151 , including the great number with close @entity40 connections , will look on in bafflement at these remarks - @entity101 is a country that has gained its independence from @entity148 and has never looked back			1
' at least his @entity158 gaffe was little more than an embarrassing slip of the tongue			2
at an @entity163 media conference he said : ' they 're very forthright remarks , and i think that they 're perfectly appropriate remarks for the @entity158 prime minister to make			1
@entity158 , @entity158 , probably has more involvement in the affairs of @entity170 than @entity101 often does			1
' ' @entity3 has a reputation for gaffes ' , so said the @entity40 when the @entity54 bought into their push for independence the relationship with @entity176 was strained , to say the least , when it was revealed @entity101 spy agencies had spied on that country 's president @entity179			1
when details were revealed of how his mobile phone had been tapped by officers , mr @entity3 's reply was not as conciliatory as @entity176 had hoped			2
' @entity101 should not be expected to apologise for the steps we take to protect our country now , or in the past , any more than other governments should be expected to apologise for the similar steps they have taken , ' mr @entity3 said			2
' importantly , in @entity101 's case , we use all our resources including information to help our friends and allies , not to harm them			1
' he went on to say that the surveillance was ' reasonable '			0
@entity179 made his protests known on twitter @entity179 sought a clear public response from his @entity101 counterpart the @entity176 president was clearly very unimpressed by @entity3 's ' belittling ' of the spy scandal on the home front , mr @entity3 struggled to keep the nation 's indigenous leaders on - side during a recent speech , by repeatedly stating that the arrival of the @entity209 ' was the defining moment in the history of this continent '			1
' it was the moment this continent became part of the modern world			2
it determined our language , our law and our fundamental values			0
yes , it did dispossess and for a long time marginalise @entity224 people , ' mr @entity3 said			0
' as @entity225 frequently reminds us , modern @entity101 has an important @entity224 and multicultural character			2
still it 's @entity107 settlement that has most profoundly shaped the country that we are			0
' but @entity230 , chairman of the prime minister 's own @entity231 , fired back that white settlement was in fact ' a disastrous defining moment for indigenous people '			1
@entity237 , head of the @entity239 for @entity240 , also disapproved			0
' i ca n't fathom how a ship or a boat sailed into @entity244 can overtake the 60,000 years before			0
' but it was when the prime minister tried to tackle the issue of home - grown terrorist sympathisers , with a call to arms under the ' @entity253 ' banner , that social media went into meltdown			1
' we do have to be vigilant against it - and my position is that everyone has got to be on @entity253 , ' mr @entity3 implored			1
' everyone has got to put this country , its interest and its values and its people first			0
' @entity265 exploded into action once the @entity54 had made the ' @entity253 ' remark plenty of tweets provided novel ideas of just who , instead of @entity3 , should lead ' @entity253 ' the ' @entity253 ' call was the source of countless satirical tweets @entity151 will no longer have the ' right to be a bigot '			1
this was a back - flip which backfired , as the @entity3 government dropped from its controversial plan to overhaul the @entity281			0
the backlash from ethnic community leaders and from within his own party led to the pm and his attorney - general @entity285 admitting defeat on the so - called ' @entity287 '			0
almost overnight he went from being seen as too hard to being too soft			0
back - flip on the ' right to be a bigot ' laws			0
both the @entity54 and his attorney - general came under fire , externally and internally , over their plans to change the @entity294 and their subsequent backdown there 's been a few wrong turns			1
mr @entity3 chats with treasurer @entity298 in the @entity299			0
mr @entity298 has had a trying 12 months too , including the infamous ' poor people do n't drive ' gaffe , comments which the @entity54 quickly distanced himself from perhaps just as damaging within the party room was the @entity305 trip scandal , which led @entity306 to claim the pm was ' not fit to govern '			0
the prime minister was alleged to have told party colleagues the reason he was late to a meeting was that he had organised a last - minute trip to a cancer clinic to ' justify billing taxpayers ' for the trip			2
and one other broken pre-election promise which has n't gone unnoticed was his pledge not to be caught swanning around in his speedos			0
but there here was in his favourite swimwear , fresh out of the surf and fending off questions , in the most awkward of breakfast television interviews			0
the noted fitness fanatic , insisted in a radio interview that he had the necessary energy levels for the top job			1
mr @entity3 visited a cancer clinic during a trip to @entity305 last month amid accusations he told party room colleagues that it was organised so he could ' justify billing taxpayers ' opposition leader @entity306 claimed that @entity3 was ' not fit to govern ' in the wake of the revelations regarding his @entity305 trip ' i ’m lucky in that i ’ve got quite a bit of stamina , i do n’t need more than six hours sleep a night , ' he said			0
' i can bound out of bed at five o’clock in the morning , i find i can go through the day ' til about ten o’clock pretty comfortably			0
' the opposition pounced , arguing that a prime minister who does n't realise that 10am to 5pm is actually seven hours , ca n't be trusted to balance the books			0
it 's been a tough 12 months .			0

caused outrage when he infamously winked during a radio interview , as a pensioner revealed she had to work on a sex line to make ends meet
*widely* *ridiculed* on @entity265 for his *constant* reference to ' @entity253 '
during his @entity357 trip referred to @entity158 as @entity359
angered indigenous @entity151 by insisting the arrival of @entity209 was @entity101 's defining moment , just weeks after saying the nation was ' *unsettled* ' prior to 1788
