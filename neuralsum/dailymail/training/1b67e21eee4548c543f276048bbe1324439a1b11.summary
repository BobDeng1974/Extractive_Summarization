by @entity0 she 's famous for her relaxed approach to royal walkabouts but even the @entity3 could n't hide her surprise when offered a perch on a well - wisher 's knee during a visit			1
after bursting into fits of laughter , @entity8 delicately took up @entity12 's offer as she took her place at the centre of a group photo with staff at the @entity17 of @entity18			1
mr @entity12 , the business ' managing director , looked thrilled by his usually close brush with royalty , as did the chuckling staff members			0
new throne : @entity8 , @entity3 , perches on the knee of @entity12 ( left ) during a visit @entity8 was visiting the bakery as part of the annual royal tour of @entity29 which kicked off yesterday with a visit to a jazz festival			1
but it was the bakery trip that proved the highlight of the week so far , with @entity8 cheerfully donning a white coat and hat over her pretty navy and white patterned dress for the tour			2
later , she tried on some clothes of an entirely different sort as she visited the @entity41 sporting her favourite taupe coat and white pleated skirt			0
there , she was treated to a catwalk show and inspected pieces by some of @entity29 's hottest young design talent before being presented with a tiny teddy for her grandson @entity50			0
taking her seat : @entity8 giggles as mr @entity12 makes the offer before sitting down on his knee eye - opening : @entity8 gets an eyeful of a risque display at the @entity41 enjoying the show : @entity8 sat front row with @entity59 , the brains behind the event , during the show is that for @entity50 ? @entity8 was given a teddybear for her grandson at the fashion festival stylish : @entity8 wore a white pleated skirt and taupe jacket for her visit to the @entity70 she was also confronted with a set of risqué mannequins but appeared none the worse for the experience			1
@entity75 , however , was nowhere to be seen and instead of joining the @entity3 at the bakery , travelled to the @entity77 in @entity78 where he found himself face - to - face with a huge fluffy red squirrel			1
happily for the environmentalist prince , this one was a toy gifted to him as he was brought up to speed with efforts to save the red squirrel , an endangered native species			2
once common to the whole of the @entity89 , the red squirrel is threatened by the increasing numbers of grey squirrels , with the alien species forcing the native reds north			0
keepers at the @entity77 have hit upon a novel solution to the problem - trapping any greys spotted on the land			0
tasty : @entity8 listened intently as she was told about shortbread before being handed some to try enjoying the tour : despite being forced to don a white cover - all and hat , @entity8 enjoyed her visit to the bakery lovely to meet you : @entity8 is introduced to bakery staff at the @entity17 of @entity18 present for @entity50 ? a delighted prince @entity75 was handed a giant red squirrel toy for @entity50 on the way to @entity108 : the toy , presented by the @entity110 , was placed in the boot meeting : prince @entity75 meets @entity112 veteran dr @entity112 at @entity113 in @entity114 the programme , which has been underway since 2009 , sees @entity116 , the estate 's gamekeeper , trap up to 63 grey squirrels a year - with dramatically beneficial effects for the reds			1
later , the @entity75 attended a reception for the @entity110 's 50th anniversary at @entity123 , near @entity114 before carrying on to @entity113 for a tour of the @entity112 @entity125 , which reopened last year after a £ 3.5 million redevelopment			0
@entity75 is royal colonel of the @entity112 , @entity112 , as well as patron of the @entity128 and of the @entity129			0
the visits to the @entity17 and @entity77 are part of a week of @entity29 engagements for the @entity75 and @entity3 , who are known as the @entity133 and @entity134 north of the border			1
later this week , the royal couple will meet athletes preparing to take part in the @entity139 before joining the @entity140 for the opening ceremony on thursday night			0
so that 's how you do it ! prince @entity75 meets the @entity145 outside @entity113 looking around : @entity113 houses a museum dedicated to the @entity112 regiment			2
