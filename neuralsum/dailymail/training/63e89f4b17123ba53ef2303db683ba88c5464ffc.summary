by @entity0 published : 18:13 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 09:26 est , 24 august 2012 two of prince @entity4 ’s most high - ranking personal protection officers watched him being photographed playing ‘ strip billiards ’ in his @entity6 hotel suite but failed to take any action , it was confirmed yesterday			1
one made only a half - hearted attempt to remonstrate with a group of naked girls – whom the prince had only just met in a casino bar but still recklessly took to his room to cavort with until the early hours			1
the unidentified @entity16 detective took no further action and even allowed the drunken women to dress and then leave with their camera phones and undeleted snaps			1
rumbled : now in @entity22 , this is thought to be the moment the prince learned the naked photos of him had been published he was , claimed one source , ‘ enjoying the party more than protecting the prince from himself ’			1
within days the pictures had been sold to a @entity33 celebrity gossip website and broadcast around the world , causing intense embarrassment to the @entity36			1
two of the royal bodyguards are to be quizzed over accusations that they did not do enough to stop the pictures being taken			0
@entity16 officially refused to comment but metropolitan police commissioner @entity41 is understood to have asked to be personally briefed on the issue			0
today princess @entity44 ’s former royalty protection officer @entity43 said : ' the moment you invite unknown people into your hotel room there is a question of invasion of privacy and as far as security is concerned it is potentially dangerous			2
' if one of these girls had planted drugs or had a knife rather than taken pictures then the officers would be in serious trouble			2
there should have been better security			0
' i always questioned the practice of sending the less experienced protection officers with the younger royals			1
i think it should be the other way round			0
' what happens in vegas ... does n't stay in vegas : the party - loving royal was enjoying himself - but it is unclear as to what sort of reaction he will face on his return home although millions have already viewed the photographs on the internet – indeed ‘ @entity4 , naked ’ is one of the most used phrases on search engines and the images are easy to find – the @entity86 media are still prevented from using them after @entity87 claimed they were an ‘ invasion of the prince ’s privacy ’			1
however @entity93 newspaper has decided to publish them after receiving what is believed to be a first - hand account of the night from a girl who was present in the room			0
further details of the prince ’s sleazy antics on friday last week were already emerging yesterday			1
the @entity102 has been told that within minutes of checking into his suite on the 63rd floor of the five - star @entity106 through a private lobby , @entity4 and two of his friends were out on the town			0
the group started their night at the @entity113 before returning via a private lift to their suite to change			0
the prince and his protection officers then made their way to the @entity120 nightclub , set around a pool and featuring go - go dancers gyrating on stripper poles to the sounds of thudding house music			1
mingling with the crowds are dozens of prostitutes , a common sight in @entity129 , openly approaching single men			0
calm before the storm : @entity132 ( centre ) relaxed with his friend @entity134 ( right ) @entity4 and his friends took over a two - storey cabana – an enclosure by the pool – closest to the private exit to his suite where they downed jaegerbombs – potent alcoholic drinks			0
he stayed chatting to his friends and a group of girls from about 1am until 3.30am on saturday before returning to the suite			2
the @entity102 was told early yesterday that two of @entity4 ’s taxpayer - funded , round - the - clock police protection officers were with him when the pictures of him naked were taken			1
this was later confirmed by website tmz which broke the story after being sold the pictures			2
it said yesterday : ‘ the night of the naked @entity6 hotel party , @entity4 was hanging with two male friends ... after some boozing , the group decided to bring a bunch of chicks they had just met back to @entity4 ’s vip suite at @entity164			1
‘ that ’s when @entity4 ’s people dropped the ball			0
‘ when the girls entered the room , we ’re told the ladies were not asked to surrender their phones ... an epic failure considering @entity4 ’s well - documented wild side			1
‘ as the party fired up , several girls began to snap pics on their cell - phones … and one of @entity4 ’s minders lackadaisically told the women , “ awww , come on … no photos ”			1
‘ sources who were there tell @entity152 the minders were asleep at the wheel , enjoying the party more than protecting the prince from himself			1
‘ after more boozing , the clothes came off … and more photos were taken , in plain view of the handlers , yet @entity4 ’s people did nothing			0
’ the website added : ‘ @entity152 spoke with several people in the @entity6 vip scene who tell us they see situations like this every day and it could have been easily contained , but as one source put it , “ @entity4 ’s team acted like a bunch of amateurs ”			2
’ hours later at least one of @entity4 ’s police protection officers was also photographed with him wearing a straw hat and swimming trunks in a @entity209 at a raucous ‘ pool party ’ at the nearby @entity211			1
one @entity86 newspaper decided to publish the pictures going against the wishes of the palace in a statement @entity87 said : ' newspapers regulate themselves , so the publication of the photographs is ultimately a decision for editors to make ' on his first full day back in the country after the scandal broke , the @entity223 ’s grandson was keeping a low profile yesterday and ordered his advisers not to discuss the incident or reveal his whereabouts			1
he is still officially on holiday until next week , when he is due to report for duty as an @entity233 attack helicopter pilot , and has no planned public engagements until an appearance at the @entity236 at the beginning of september			0
but well - placed sources have told the @entity102 that @entity4 drove to @entity239 , his father ’s @entity240 base , on tuesday afternoon shortly after touching down at @entity242 from @entity243			2
he immediately went in to see his private secretary , @entity244			0
they remained in mr @entity244 ’s office for around 45 minutes discussing how to handle the fall - out from the pictures			2
it was around this time that instructions were given to prince @entity252 ’s personal lawyers , @entity253 and @entity254 who went to the @entity255 to ensure @entity86 newspapers could not publish the photographs that had already been viewed by millions on the internet			1
sir @entity259 , who chaired the @entity255 between 2003 and 2009 , said that it was unclear whether the prince ’s privacy had in fact been breached			2
he told @entity264 : ‘ you could argue , “ sure , it ’s a private place , it ’s his room ” , but if he invites a bunch of strangers to his room , is his privacy already violated ? ’ meanwhile , questions were continuing to be asked how the @entity274 could have allowed the incident to get so out of control			2
moment of realisation ? @entity4 arrived in @entity243 just an hour after the photos surfaced on the internet and spent much of his time on his mobile phone suggesting that the news had been broken to him explaining himself ? the young prince was on holiday after an exemplary performance as an @entity289 ambassador - but his good work might unravel after the publication of photos of his antics tense : in blue shirt , cream panama hat and sunglasses , the prince looked apprehensive as he waited outside a restaurant in trendy @entity299 metropolitan police commissioner @entity41 has dismissed the furore , saying of his officers : ‘ they are there to protect him for security reasons , not regulate his life			1
’ but his casual attitude has infuriated @entity309 , the former head of @entity16 ’s @entity310 , who said ‘ questions should be asked about his judgement ’ , particularly after the @entity102 published pictures yesterday of one protection officer lounging in a @entity209 with @entity4 the following day			1
the former chief superintendent acknowledged the commissioner ’s point that the prince ’s minders were not ‘ guardians of his moral compass ’			1
but he argued that if @entity4 unwisely chose to invite a group of girls to his room and allowed them to photograph him in a compromising situation , then it was an issue for the police			1
‘ we all love @entity4 because he is a bit of a maverick but i find it incredible , knowing what the prince and his friends are like , there that there was not a preordained back - up plan , ’ he said			2
‘ if @entity4 wanted to pop over to my house for tea now it would have to be fully recced in advance and all of those present vetted			0
we would be prevented from taking photographs of him and may even be made to hand over our cameras and phones for the duration of his visit			2
‘ why should this be so different when he is abroad ? ‘ from what we know there seems to have been a fundamental failure to create an adequate contingency plan so that when @entity4 ca n’t turn off , the officers concerned are able to step in with some kind of authority			0
’ he added : ‘ in my day the @entity36 were guarded by more mature officers with actual authority			0
i also introduced tenure which ensured officers were in their jobs for only five to seven years to stop people getting too close			0
it reminded them who was paying them to do their job			0
‘ protecting a member of the @entity36 includes guarding their reputation – and if he ca n’t see that as a commissioner then questions must be asked about his judgement			0
this is a security issue regardless of what the commissioner says			0
‘ if @entity4 had been in his own private , secure accommodation we would all agree that what he does is of no interest of us – but when he picks up a group of girls he has never met before and takes them back to his room , then it is a completely different issue			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity16 said they would not discuss matters of protection .			0
