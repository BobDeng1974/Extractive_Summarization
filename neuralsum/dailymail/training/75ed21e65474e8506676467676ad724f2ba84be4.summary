from the grim - faced @entity3 woman in her patterned dress to the unsmiling visage of photographer @entity6 , the world 's oldest selfies are a surprisingly joyless bunch			1
but while modern selfies are just for fun , for the pioneering posers of the 1800s , photographic self - portraits were revolutionary			0
now @entity13 has rounded up some of the best - and the results are surprisingly impressive			0
stunning : this image , which dates from 1900 , shows a female photographer and her @entity17 along with the woman standing beside her @entity20 , there are group shots and even one taken outdoors in what appears to be the @entity24			1
other shots include a 1930s effort of a beautifully dressed woman posing with what looks like a trophy and a wonderful close - up of a tweed - suited gent taken in 1938			0
like the modern selfie trend , which appeared in the wake of the social media and @entity37 revolution , the vintage version was also the result of a technical innovation			2
the camera - and modern photography - began life in 1790 with a basic model created by the @entity45 's @entity44 , which , by 1826 , had been developed into a device resembling modern cameras by @entity49 inventor @entity48			2
originals : @entity6 in his 1839 selfie ( left ) and snapper @entity51 in an daring selfie taken in 1966 by 1838 , human beings had made their first appearance on film - an event swiftly followed by the first selfie , which was the work of @entity60 photographer @entity6 and taken in 1839			1
but the era of the selfie did n't truly dawn until 1900 , when @entity20 's revolutionary @entity64 appeared on shelves			1
priced at just $ 1 each , the cardboard device took two inch photos on 117mm roll film and sold in the millions			0
the @entity17 was cheap , easy to use , and even helped to introduce the world to the concept of the snapshot			1
and as the image of the @entity3 woman , her @entity17 poised at waist height , proves , it also helped to popularise the selfie			1
@entity78 classic : a @entity80 staff photographer captures his own image in a mirror , circa 1948 launched in february 1900 , the @entity20 was the first mass - produced camera			1
easy to use and , at just a dollar each , cheap to buy , it revolutionised the art of photography - until then available only to a limited number of very wealthy people			0
made from cardboard and in possession of a simple meniscus lens , it look tiny two - inch square photos at the push of a button			0
unlike modern cameras , the viewfinder was perched on the top which meant users had to hold the device at waist height and look down			0
later models included a bakelite version , the @entity20 127 , of which millions were sold between 1952 and 1967			2
there was also a slightly more expensive spin - off model , the @entity107 , which used a more advanced doublet lens and were smaller than their conventional counterparts			0
although the @entity17 is no longer in production , many historical examples are still in existence and , if cared for well enough , can still create wonderful photos today .			2
