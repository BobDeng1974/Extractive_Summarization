by @entity1 reporter published : 08:49 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 08:49 est , 1 may 2013 doctors are warning that an antibiotic - resistant strain of gonorrhoea , now considered a superbug , has the potential to be as deadly as the @entity8 virus			1
gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in @entity11			1
this particular strain of gonorrhea , known as @entity14 , was discovered in @entity15 two years ago in a 31 - year - old female sex worker who had been screened in 2009			1
the bacteria has since been found in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			0
in a bid to avoid contracting gonorrhea , in particular the @entity14 strain , people are encouraged to practice safe sex @entity14 has so far proved resistant to current antibiotic treatment and so it has been placed in the superbug category			1
‘ this might be a lot worse than @entity8 in the short run because the bacteria is more aggressive and will affect more people quickly , ’ @entity28 , a doctor of naturopathic medicine told @entity30			1
nearly 30 million people have died from @entity8 related causes worldwide , but @entity28 believes the effect of the gonorrhea bacteria is more direct			2
‘ getting gonorrhea from this strain might put someone into septic shock and death in a matter of days , ’ @entity28 said			2
‘ this is very dangerous			0
’ in a briefing on @entity51 last week , @entity47 , executive director of the @entity48 for @entity49 , urged @entity52 to target nearly $ 54 million in immediate funding to help find an antibiotic for @entity14 and to conduct an education and public awareness campaign			2
this particular strain of gonorrhea , known as @entity14 , was first discovered in @entity15 two years ago in a 31 - year - old female sex worker although no deaths from @entity14 have been reported as yet , experts say avoiding the disease completely is the best course of action			1

dctors are warning that an antibiotic - resistant strain of gonorrhoea has the potential to be as deadly as the @entity8 virus left untreated , gonorrhea can lead to a host of complications including pelvic inflammatory disease , infertility , and blood stream infections			1
it also raises the risk for @entity102 because the lesions permit the @entity8 - causing virus easier access to the bloodstream			0
gonorrhea is especially common among people between the ages of 15 and 24			1
the disease became curable in the 1940s when penicillin and other antibiotics were introduced			0
since then , the medical world has created more new drugs that killed the ever - mutating gonorrhea bacteria			2
nearly 30 million people have died from @entity8 related causes worldwide , but the effect of the gonorrhea bacteria is more direct on a state - by - state basis , pockets of the @entity121 are seeing giant spikes in the disease			1
@entity125 saw a 74 percent rise in gonorrhea cases in 2012 , with the trend continuing into the first few months of this year			2
in @entity130 , cases rose 35 percent in 2012 , according to the state 's department of health , and according to the latest statistics from the @entity134 , ‘ during 2010 – 2011 , 61 % ( 31/51 ) of states , plus the @entity136 , reported an increase in gonorrhea rates			2
’ @entity139 , the last available class of antibiotics recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea , has been failing worldwide and there is the very real prospect that all types of gonorrhea will soon become untreatable			0
professor @entity148 , head of the @entity149 in the @entity150 told the @entity151 last week : ‘ there is a possibility that if we do n't do something then it could become untreatable by 2015			0
