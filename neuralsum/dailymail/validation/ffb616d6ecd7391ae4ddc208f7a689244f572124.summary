the @entity1 administration has put the brakes on its plans to ban a popular type of rifle ammunition after an onslaught of criticism from both the public and lawmakers			0
' you spoke , we listened , ' the agency said tuesday afternoon on @entity13			0
the @entity14 says the agency received more than 80,000 public comments on the proposal to outlaw some types of 5.56 mm rounds – also known as .223 caliber ammunition			1
the agency said tuesday that comments ran overwhelmingly against the proposal , which it first floated in february			0
the ammunition targeted by the @entity14 is commonly known as ' green - tip ' because of its distinctive appearance			1
green - tip : the popular rifle ammunition is no longer being targeted for extinction by the @entity14 hunters and target shooters use the bullets , primarily in @entity31 - style rifles like this one , but the ammo could travel fast enough from a handgun to pierce a police officer 's body armor @entity37 : the @entity14 decided tuesday that it could n't withstand an onslaught from legislators and the public ' although @entity14 endeavored to create a proposal that reflected a good faith interpretation of the law and balanced the interests of law enforcement , industry , and sportsmen , the vast majority of the comments received to date are critical of the framework , and include issues that deserve further study , ' the agency said in a press release			1
' accordingly , @entity14 will not at this time seek to issue a final framework			2
' that carefully parsed language leaves open the possibility that the government could revive the idea in the future			0
the @entity14 plans to keep collecting comments until march 16			2
hundreds of lawmakers , including 52 @entity64 senators , also objected			2
the @entity14 had proposed banning the ammunition , most commonly used in the popular @entity31 - style rifles , because they could potentially penetrate a police officer 's protective vest if fired from a handgun instead			1
the @entity71 banned armor - piercing handgun ammunition in 1986			1
@entity74 - tip ammo has long been exempt because it 's primarily used in hunting and target - shooting rifles			1
the @entity14 's proposal would have removed that exemption , effectively banning its sale in the @entity64			1
@entity81 @entity80 rep. @entity80 took a rhetorical victory lap on tuesday from his perch as chairman of the @entity85			0
' after much pressure from a large , bipartisan majority in the @entity89 , i am pleased that the @entity90 has abandoned its attack on the @entity92 , ' @entity80 said in a statement			2
' it is entirely inappropriate for president @entity1 to stretch his regulatory authority to implement partisan policies that @entity97 has refused to enact , ' he added			0
' such an abuse of power would impact many law - abiding gun owners and restrict the @entity64 people 's ability to legally and responsibly exercise their @entity92 rights			2
' last week @entity80 and 238 other @entity89 members , including seven @entity105 , sent a verbal stop sign to the @entity14			1
' under no circumstances should @entity14 adopt a standard that will ban ammunition that is overwhelmingly used by law - abiding @entity64 for legitimate purposes , ' the lawmakers wrote to @entity14 director @entity113			1
on monday a group of 53 @entity116 senators complained in a similar letter to @entity113 that efforts to respect the @entity92 to the @entity119 – which protects the ' right to bear arms ' – ' require not only access to firearms , but to bullets			1
' ' if law - abiding gun owners can not obtain rifle ammunition , or face substantial difficulty in finding ammunition available and at reasonable prices because government entities are banning such ammunition , then the @entity92 is at risk , ' they claimed			2
only one @entity116 senator , @entity135 of @entity136 , chose not to sign the letter			0
he faces a brutal re-election fight next year in a blue state where gun control advocates have a strong presence			0
the @entity142 also claimed victory on tuesday			0
' vast majority of the comments ... are critical ' : @entity14 's message to @entity64 admitted that hardly anyone supported them the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) is a @entity148 agency in charge of regulating access to a wide variety of materials rifle owners complained that without the green - tip ammo , their guns could become useless overnight ' today 's announcement proves what we have said all along – this was 100 % political , ' @entity142 executive vice president @entity157 said in a statement			1
' president @entity1 failed to pass gun control through @entity97 , so he tried impose his political agenda through executive fiat			0
but every gun owner in @entity64 needs to understand @entity1 's hatred of the @entity92 has not changed			0
' the nation 's largest gun - rights group is preparing for its annual convention next month in @entity171 , @entity172 , where potential presidential candidates including former @entity175 gov. @entity174 , @entity175 sen. @entity176 , former @entity178 gov. @entity177 and @entity180 gov. @entity179 will rally thousands of the @entity92 lobby 's backers			2
the controversy has also brought a legislative brickbat out of the @entity89 , with @entity178 @entity185 rep. @entity185 introducing the @entity186			0
that bill proposed to generally limit the @entity14 's power to regulate ammunition			1
speaking of tuesday 's resolution , @entity175 @entity190 rep. @entity190 said : ' this was way out of step with reality and i ’m glad it ’s over			0

' green - tip ' bullets were oni the *endangered* list as @entity14 wanted to remove its exemption from a *federal* law that protects police officers
it 's mostly used in hunters and target shooting rifles , but could pierce body armor if it 's fired through a handgun
53 senators and *239* @entity89 members – including seven @entity105 – signed protest letters to the @entity14 's director
@entity14 gave in , saying it would *shelve* the proposal
@entity142 called it a polical plan
