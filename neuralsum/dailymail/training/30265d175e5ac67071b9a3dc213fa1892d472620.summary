' perfect simplicity : @entity1 's s / s14 show , held at the @entity20 , saw clean - lined suits complete with @entity15 collars with its fresh palette of crisp whites set off by injections of navy and solid statements of lemon , @entity10 's latest offering was streamlined in form , colour and pattern			1
there was trompe l'oeil beadwork over sheer layers , whilst skirts were full and featured hand - blocked prints			1

writing on @entity71 , @entity21 said of the collection : ' stunning fresh @entity74 silhouettes			1
' @entity75 was equally impressed , writing : ' was it the rain , the fact it was friday night , or disinterest that meant the @entity1 show was so poorly attended ? ' no matter , it was a return to form with sugary linen shorts and dresses , lots of sheer white gauze over knife or box pleated skirts , graphic zig zag prints and sundresses that were very @entity91 circa to catch a thief			2
seeing stripes : holiday tones of pink grapefruit , sunny yellow , grass green and sea blue brightened up tailored shorts and simple sundresses , whilst graphic @entity69 prints were set against cooling whites ' less successful were the floaty kaftans , and the culottes			2
' @entity18 also had input into the beauty look			0
' beauty ? yes i do that , it 's very very natural			0
it 's very " beach " , clean , very natural beauty			0
no heavy make - up , very soft , ' he explained			0
speaking about the build - up to @entity112 , he said : ' it 's been long hours , the week leading up to it is hell , i wo n't beat around the bush , success : there were lots of sheer white gauze over knife or box pleated skirts , graphic zig zag prints and sundresses that were very @entity91 circa to catch a thief ' i do n't believe that anybody , any designer , will tell you that they look forward to this week			0
' you wait with baited breathe , not with any sense of pleasure			0
' it 's jolly hard work and my favourite thing is when it 's over			0
but i wo n't be going to bed , i will be celebrating by going out to dinner , ' he said			0
