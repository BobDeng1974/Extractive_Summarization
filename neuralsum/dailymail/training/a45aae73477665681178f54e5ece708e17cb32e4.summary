by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 15 february 2013 @entity1 was today facing the prospect of being forced to remove offending posts on the @entity5 website after a judge ‘ opened the door ’ for the firm being required to monitor what users write			1
the @entity12 - based internet giant convinced @entity14 ’s @entity13 in a libel case that @entity5 is the equivalent of a blank wall and it can not be held responsible for what is written there by people			1
but the court ruled in the case involving law student @entity23 that it was arguable @entity1 was a ‘ publisher ’ in defamation law , and therefore responsible for offending comments once told of them			1
court ruling : @entity1 was today facing the prospect of being forced to remove offending posts on @entity5 however the court 's decision will come as little comfort to former @entity32 hopeful mr @entity23 , who was vilified on @entity5 by entirely false allegations of drug dealing and dishonesty			1
his epic legal tangle with @entity1 , which was first reported by @entity37 one year ago , has so far only earned him a huge legal costs bill - £ 30,000 of which he must find within the next two weeks			2
@entity39 , sitting with master of the @entity41 and @entity42 , upheld @entity1 's arguments that @entity5 is a ‘ purely passive wall ’ with no responsibility for internet ‘ graffiti ’			1
mr @entity23 's plea that @entity1 was a primary publisher of the smears was rejected as ‘ misplaced ’ by the judge , who said it only operates as a ‘ facilitator ’ , enabling other people to express their views			1
@entity1 could not be compared to an author or editor and the judge said he was also ‘ very doubtful ’ that it could be viewed as a ‘ secondary publisher ’ , in a similar way to a libellous article ‘ distributor ’			2
however , the judge went on to rule that @entity1 and others do have a responsibility to remove offending material from their sites within a reasonable time of a complaint of libel being received			0
contest : the court ruled in a case involving law student @entity23 ( pictured ) that it was arguable @entity1 was a ' publisher ' in defamation law , and therefore responsible for offending comments once notified he said that if @entity1 failed to act swiftly enough , it might be inferred to have associated itself , or made itself responsible for , a libellous post			1
it would at that point become responsible as a publisher and could be sued			0
in mr @entity23 ’s case the libellous posts had been taken down and - although he argued @entity1 failed to do that quickly enough - the judge ruled that ‘ the game would not be worth the candle ’ if his libel case went ahead			1
' @entity1 's position is that it had no control over the content of the material posed on the “ @entity92 ” blog			2
it was not the publisher of that material but a neutral service provider ' @entity97 @entity96 , for @entity1 during the very brief period in which @entity1 could conceivably have been held liable , the judge said it was ‘ highly improbable that any significant number of readers ’ would have seen the comments prior to their removal			2
mr @entity23 was suing @entity1 over anonymous comments made in reaction to a posting on the ‘ @entity92 ’ blog			1
amongst other things , he was accused - without justification - of being a drug dealer and having stolen from his employers			0
dismissing his claim last year , top libel judge mr @entity113 said : ‘ it is no doubt often true that the owner of a wall which has been festooned , overnight , with defamatory graffiti could acquire scaffolding and have it all deleted with whitewash ’			0
but he added : ‘ that is not necessarily to say , however , that the unfortunate owner must , unless and until this has been accomplished , be classified as a publisher ’			0
search engine : @entity39 , sitting with master of the @entity41 and @entity42 , upheld @entity1 's arguments that @entity5 is a ' purely passive wall ' with no responsibility for internet ' graffiti ' the libel claim brought by mr @entity23 , who in 2011 stood as a @entity132 candidate in local elections in @entity134 , @entity135 , was left dead in the water by the ruling , even though nobody had suggested the accusations made against him were even ‘ remotely true ’			1
on appeal , @entity140 , for mr @entity23 , had argued for an extension of libel laws to police the melting pot of the internet			2
' @entity146 that happens on the internet is genuinely ' automatic ' or ' passive ' ... the notion that the internet runs ' automatically ' or ' passively ' is in essence a powerful myth which has been fostered very successfully and profitably by internet superpowers such as @entity1 ' @entity140 , for @entity154 he said : ‘ @entity146 that happens on the internet is genuinely " automatic " or " passive " ... the notion that the internet runs " automatically " or " passively " is in essence a powerful myth which has been fostered very successfully and profitably by internet superpowers such as @entity1			0
‘ it suits their business model to take and to be seen to be taking a “ hands off ” approach and not really able to do anything about problems that may be generated by their internet - based operations			0
’ however , @entity171 , for @entity1 , argued : ‘ @entity5 is a platform that allows any internet user around the world to create his or her own independent blog , free of charge			2
‘ it is a piece of computer technology ... @entity1 does not create , select , solicit , censor or approve the content of a blog , which is published and controlled only the blog owner or blogger			0
analogy : mr @entity113 said the owner of wall which has been covered in defamatory graffiti could have it taken off with whitewash , but added that the owner should not be classified as a publisher until then ‘ @entity1 's position is ... that it had no control over the content of the material posed on the “ @entity92 ” blog			1
it was not the publisher of that material but a neutral service provider			0
’ his appeal dismissed , mr @entity23 was ordered to pay 50 per cent of @entity1 's legal costs			1
he will have to pay £ 30,000 on account within 14 days , but that is likely to be only a fraction of the final bill he will face			0
' the ruling does open the door for a future case where a court might take up the comments of the @entity13 in this case and run with them			2
but we are not there yet			0
in the meantime , @entity1 and other similar companies will rightly be worried that they may be liable in similar future cases ' @entity222 , barrister and @entity224 editor @entity222 , barrister and editor of the @entity224 , told @entity37 : ‘ the court did not rule that @entity1 is legally obliged to take down offending posts once they are notified of them - in this regard , the judgment has little or no legal effect on @entity1			1
‘ the court did rule that it was arguable that @entity1 was a " publisher " in defamation law , and therefore responsible for defamatory comments once notified of them			1
‘ @entity1 in fact won this case , because even if it had been potentially liable under defamation law , the offending comment only had a " trivial " effect			1
‘ the ruling does , however , open the door for a future case where a court might take up the comments of the @entity13 in this case and run with them			2
‘ but we are not there yet			0
in the meantime , @entity1 and other similar companies will rightly be worried that they may be liable in similar future cases			0
’ a @entity1 spokesman told @entity37 : ' @entity1 helps spread knowledge , enabling people to find out about almost anything by typing a few words into a computer			0
' and services like @entity5 , @entity261 and @entity262 help users to express themselves and share different points of view			0
where content is illegal or violates our terms of service we will continue to remove it			0

@entity1 says @entity5 is blank wall and it is *n't* responsible for writings online
but appeal court hears it 's arguable @entity1 is ' publisher ' in defamation law
legal expert : ' another court could run with these comments in the future '
long - running case involves student @entity23 who was vilified online
