the government claims to have a zero - tolerance approach to the issue			0
but @entity11 has discovered that @entity3 have agreed to : health officials claim the cuts have been made because to allow the hospitals to cope with the superbug one of the most vocal campaigners is @entity18 star @entity17 , 60 , whose mother - in - law died of @entity20 in 2006			1
she said : ‘ this is outrageous			0
my mother - in - law had no dignity at her death			0
‘ she had no control over her bowels			2
the c. diff ate through her bowels and poisoned her blood			0
’ health officials claim the unpublicised changes have been made because many hospitals are doing all they can to beat the bugs			1
details were published in an @entity37 document outlining @entity20 ‘ objectives ’ for 2014/15			1
it says some infections are a consequence of ‘ factors outside the control of the @entity37 ’			1
many hospitals have been hit with fines for having more than 4,477 cases of the superbug targets have been relaxed at 89 of 160 @entity50 hospital trusts			1

@entity76 health officials have made changes to the fines imposed on hospitals
hospitals *affected* by fine *reduction* are those with *presence* of the superbug
officials claim changes been made because many hospitals are doing all they can to beat the bugs
they say infections are consequence of ‘ factors outside control of the @entity37 ’
increase the number of @entity99 *difficile* cases that hospitals can have before being fined ;
cut the fine for each ‘ *excess* ’ case by *80* per cent – from **£** *50,000* to just **£** *10,000* ;
let doctors decide if an infection counts towards a fine , making it easier for hospitals to avoid *sanctions* .
