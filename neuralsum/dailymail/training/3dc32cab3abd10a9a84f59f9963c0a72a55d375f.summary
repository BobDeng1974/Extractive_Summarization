texting and using mobile devices for long periods of time could lead to a lower life expectancy , according to a new study			0
chiropractic experts believe the hunching posture adopted by phone or tablet users can cause breathing problems , leading to cardiovascular issues later in life and a higher risk of death in older age			1
the study , by the @entity18 @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , says that poor posture could pose as big a risk to a person 's health as obesity			1
phone and tablet users tend to hunch over when they use their devices and could be putting strain on their hearts , leading to major health issues in later life the new research could also suggest a link between forward leaning postures that people use while texting , going online , sending emails and playing video games , and hyperkyphosis , which is associated with pulmonary disease and cardiovascular problems			2
the research suggests that when someone drops their heads and rounds their shoulders while looking at a phone or tablet , it is harder for them to take a full breath because of the restriction to their muscles			2
in addition , the ribs can not move properly so the heart and lungs can not function to their full effectiveness			2
more often than not , people do not know they could be doing serious long term damage to their body because the short term effects are not as noticeable , the study says			2
the @entity17 says that it 's only in later life that the effects can seriously affect quality of life			1
the hunched position in some elderly people is a condition called hyperkyphosis , which may become more prevalent in years to come this has increased fears that younger people , who are society 's biggest users of smartphones and tablets , could be knocking years off of their life expectancy			1
elderly people with a slight amount of hyperkyphosis have a much higher risk of mortality when compared with those without it			1
this is similar to the increase in risk of death from having a body mass index greater than 30 , according to the @entity17 's figures			1
@entity17 executive member @entity89 claimed that the forward - leaning posture has a greater negative effect than medical professionals previously thought			1
she said : ' we tend to drop our heads forward which rounds the shoulders and this is what we term forward - leaning posture			2
definition @entity100 is a spinal deformity that looks like a forward - curved posture of the head , upper back or thoracic spine - known as a hunchback			2
it is identified when the curvature of the spine is over 40 degrees			0
the worsening of the condition over time is associated with a higher risk of health problems later in life			0
causes @entity100 can result from conditions such as osteoporosis or thinning bones , as well as fractures of the vertebrae that result from thin bones			0
however , there are several suspected causes for the spinal deformity when vertebral fractures are not present			0
@entity100 may result from poor habitual posture , muscle weakness , degenerative disc disease , ligament degeneration , or hereditary factors			1
effects ' people are now definitely at an increased risk of having problems through the top of their neck and back because of their posture , which is causing a change in the curve of the back			1
' and there is an increased risk that they will develop this earlier on in life because of the length of time they ’ve been sitting at computers or using mobile devices			0
' the @entity17 is now recommending people get their posture checked by a chiropractor to make sure it is correct and not giving them any potential negative health effects			1
@entity155 chiropractor @entity154 has noticed the forward - leaning posture becoming more of an issue in her patients due to the increase in the use of mobile devices			0
she said : ' it ’s something i notice every day and use of mobile devices is a factor			0
' so many of us have structured our lives in a way that means we use computers , mobile phones , tablets and laptops at work and in our leisure time as well			1
' posture has been an overlooked factor in our health but research is helping us to raise awareness of it and people are now beginning to realise that good posture is more than about how it makes you look ; it ’s important for your health on a day to day basis and it can be important in terms of your life expectancy			1
' this is n’t alarmist or scaremongering ; it ’s what more and more research is telling us			0
' and the good news is that it does n’t have to happen because it ’s something we all have a degree of control over			0
' we can change our habits			0
for example , restrict the amount of time you spend on mobile devices			0
' and bring them up to your eye level , so that you ’re not looking down			0
' a lot of people might not even realise anything is wrong with their posture			2

people adopt a hunching posture when they use phones or tablets
position *constricts* breathing and blood flow , making the heart work harder
@entity17 says poor posture is as bad as obesity
risk of death from poor posture is the same as having a @entity233 over 30
