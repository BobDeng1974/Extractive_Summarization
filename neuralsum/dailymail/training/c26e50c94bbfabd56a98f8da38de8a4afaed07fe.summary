action : the neighbourhood watch group in @entity2 , @entity3 , patrol with guns and respond to calls around the clock outraged residents in rural @entity3 have formed amateur armed patrol groups to replace the budget - stricken police department			1
the unusual move comes after @entity2 sheriff announced officials will now only respond to life - threatening situations after losing necessary government grants			1
but county governors , fearful of anarchy , have condemned the organisation , urging citizens to hike their taxes instead			2
the conflict arose after the national government stopped paying the county 's federal timber subsidies - reimbursment for working on the forest - and proposed a tax hike instead			1
however , when residents opposed the bill the state - funded departments were forced to make radical changes			1
with 70 per cent of the town made up of woodland , the grant was essential			0
prisoners being released from jail and crimes operations were limited to weekdays , 9am - 3.30pm			2
finally , the @entity38 released a statement urging residents to move if they did n't feel safe as a new policy to only respond to the most serious incidents was unveiled			2
the statement read : ' @entity45 regretfully advises that if you know you are in a potentially volatile situation ( for example , you are a protected person in a restraining order that you believe the respondent may violate ) , you may want to consider relocating to an area with adequate law enforcement services			0
' defiant , retired law enforcement officer @entity52 united with the neighbourhood watch group to make up for the shortfall			0
armed with guns , the 12 - strong response team have vowed to respond to any situation , even non-life - threatening , around the clock			1
the sheriff urged people who do not feel safe to move to somewhere with a fully - functioned crime department they are part of a 100 - strong community group which meets once a month to discuss crime in the area and debate how to tackle it			1
mr @entity52 has blasted suggestions that the group should concede to raised taxes in a country still coming to terms with the @entity73 trial			0
he also insists the firearms are merely a deterrent to criminals , not meant for practical use			0
he told @entity78 : ' we believe responsible citizens doing responsible things make it hard for criminals to do irresponsible things , ' he said			0
' the county coffers are at the bottom of the barrel			0

12 - strong ' response team ' armed with guns will operate around the clock
follows government cuts , and residents *refusing* tax hike , forcing state - funded departments to scale back operations
@entity2 police dept has had to release prisoners and cut hours
