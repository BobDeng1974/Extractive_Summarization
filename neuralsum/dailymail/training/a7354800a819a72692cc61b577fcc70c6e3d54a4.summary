by @entity0 mother - of - one @entity1 , 53 , trafficked @entity3 nationals to the @entity4 with the promise of work and accommodation a woman who exploited vulnerable immigrants to work door - to - door collecting for charity has been jailed for three years			1
mother - of - one @entity1 , 53 , trafficked @entity3 nationals to the @entity4 with the promise of work and accommodation			1
many of the workers spoke little or no @entity15 and were forced to live in cramped and squalid conditions at various addresses in inner city @entity18			1
they went to work illegally for @entity1 ’s business collecting donations from members of the public across the south west of @entity15 for the @entity25 charity - being paid as little as £ 25 for a day ’s work			1
the charity , which helps terminally ill children , had outsourced the distribution and collection of bags to subcontractors who then used @entity1			2
prosecutor @entity33 told @entity34 : ' between august 2009 and november 2013 @entity1 made a profitable business out of coaxing vulnerable @entity3 adults over to the @entity4 with an offer of work in the charity bag business			1
' the offer to work included a certain rate of pay which seems quite reasonable by local @entity3 standards but was well below the national minimum wage in the @entity4			1
' she told them she would provide accommodation and would pay the cost of their travel from @entity3			2
some victims were told these costs would later be deducted from their wages while others were not told until they arrived			0
' mr @entity33 said the 11 victims - two women and nine men - felt ' totally dependent ' on @entity1 for accommodation , work and food			1
' they had no idea how to interact with the @entity4 authorities and this put them in a position where she could exploit them quite ruthlessly , ' he said			2
the court heard that @entity1 charged them £ 50 a week rent for a shared room in a house she also lived in , with people working six or seven days a week			1
she would also not give them keys to their accommodation and often locked them in , so if they wanted to leave they had to climb through a window			0
some of the workers were alcoholics and were fined if @entity1 caught them drinking			2
' the defendant took it upon herself to impose what she called " fines " on the exploited workers of a further £ 50 - two full days ’ earnings - if for any reason they did not work on a particular day , ' mr @entity33 said			1
' after the deductions for travel costs , rent and fines the workers were still theoretically owed money but @entity1 rarely paid them , save for usually inadequate amounts said to be for food			2
' many of them were reduced to attending soup kitchens for meals			0
promises to pay tomorrow or next week were not kept			0
' if they demanded the money owed to them they were often threatened with eviction or indeed evicted - without the money having been paid			0
' workers were forced to hand out and collect 1,000 clothing bags for the charity @entity110 one victim , @entity111 , told police he was owed £ 3,000 by @entity1 for work he had done for her			1
' @entity111 spoke no @entity15 and so felt totally dependent on the defendant , ' mr @entity33 said			2
' she was the boss , controlling the house , the money and the work			0
on one occasion she threatened to run him over for disobeying her , adding that she did n’t care about anything as she had been to prison before			0
' @entity123 , defending , said that @entity1 had herself been trafficked into the @entity4 from @entity3 to work collecting charity bags for £ 30 a day in @entity126 before moving to @entity18			1
' she accepts entirely that she had a central role and that she was responsible for those under her control , ' he said			0
' if there was loads of money to be made , she did n’t see it and there were others above her in the chain			0
an aggravating feature is that it was purely for financial gain			0
' passing sentence , judge @entity139 told her : ' the evidence reveals a depressing picture of vulnerable people coming from @entity3 in the hope of a better life and getting nothing like it			0
the charity helps terminally ill children and had outsourced the distribution of bags to subcontractors ' once here , they were trapped , certainly economically trapped , and within the context of the belief they had when they came here			0
' they were in a position where it was difficult for them to move on and that made them easy to control , and made it easy for you to profit from their labours			0
' they were n’t prisoners , as sometimes features in cases of this kind , but they were certainly isolated in our society and working and living in a way that civilised people should not be required to do			0
' @entity1 , who will be subjected to the @entity178 , was also issued with a @entity179 indefinitely preventing her from running an unlawful charity bag business			2
other victims included mother - of - one @entity182 , 29 , @entity183 , and 32 - year - old @entity184			1
at an earlier hearing , @entity1 , of @entity185 , @entity18 , admitted 10 charges of facilitating entry into the @entity4 with a view to exploiting labour , 10 charges of trafficking around the @entity4 and one count of forced labour			1
@entity195 , chief executive of the @entity110 charity , told @entity197 : ' we are appalled by the crimes for which ms @entity1 has been convicted , which we were made aware of a few weeks ago			1
' ms @entity1 was for a time a subcontractor of our contractor , @entity202 , to whom we outsource our bag collections			0

mother - of - one @entity1 , 53 , trafficked @entity3 nationals to the @entity4
workers spoke little or no @entity15 and forced to live in cramped conditions
were put to work collecting donations for @entity110 charity - which had no *knowledge* the scam and says it it ' appalled '
@entity1 charged £ 50 a week for a shared room in a house she also lived in
