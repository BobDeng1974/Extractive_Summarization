by @entity0 computer - generated models of individual patients helping doctors map the progression of diseases and test the outcome of potential treatments could revolutionise the @entity9 , scientists have claimed			1
a team of academics at the @entity12 are working on cutting - edge technology to allow medics tailor the use of treatment and drugs to each case			1
the work , due to be showcased at the university tomorrow , is being touted as a potential saviour to the struggling @entity9			1
the pioneering technology could replace clinical trials currently taking place in vitro - in a test tube , and those in vivo - in a living organism			0
new technology , which is being pioneered at the @entity12 and creates computer - generated models of individual patients could revolutionise the @entity9 , helping doctors map the progression of diseases and test the potential outcome of treatments the @entity34 study aims to offer a better healthcare system with more personalised treatment plans , where results of various procedures can be potentially predicted in advance the new method , in silico , allows scientists to build a sophisticated computer simulation model from a patient 's own personal data			1
known as the @entity34 , the study aims to offer a better healthcare system with more personalised treatment plan , where results can potentially be predicted in advance			0
pioneered at the university 's @entity50 for in @entity52 , the technology models and simulates human physiology and disease processes , to improve outcomes in cancer , heart disease , brain surgery and many other conditions			0
the ultimate aim of the project is to build a complete computerised model of the human body with a view to predicting patients ' future health status			2
@entity69 director professor @entity68 of the @entity12 ’s @entity70 said : ' can you imagine weather forecasting without computers nowadays ? more than 0 academics and clinicians are already developing computer simulations of disease processes that can be used directly in clinical practice to improve diagnosis and treatment ' in the same way that computers revolutionised weather forecasting , in silico medicine is bringing computers at the heart of healthcare ; they will make possible to individualise the treatment , improve the care , and reduce the costs			1
' at the @entity50 , more than 80 academics and clinicians are already developing computer simulations of disease processes that can be used directly in clinical practice to improve diagnosis and treatment			2
dr @entity96 who works on the project , highlighted the importance of the research			0
he said : ' candidly , without in silico medicines ( computer simulated ) , organiasations like the @entity9 will be unable to cope with demand ' dr @entity96 who leads business development at the @entity50 said : ‘ what we are working on here will be vital to the future of healthcare			2
‘ pressures are mounting on health and treatment resources worldwide			0
' candidly , without in silico medicines ( computer simulated ) , organiasations like the @entity9 will be unable to cope with demand			2
' we 're delighted that the @entity116 team is leading the way with this research			0
this is a real breakthrough for patients ' - dr @entity121 , consultant cardiologist at @entity122 ' the @entity34 will act as a software - based laboratory for experimentation and treatment that will save huge amounts of time and money and lead to vastly superior treatment outcomes			1
’ dr @entity121 , a consultant cardiologist at @entity131 and a senior lecturer at the @entity12 ’s @entity133 , said : ' heart disease remains one of the world ’s biggest killers , so we ’re delighted that the @entity139 team is leading the way with this research			1
' any patient with coronary heart disease who has an angiogram can , in the future , have a computerised assessment of the significance of their disease			0
' this will enable the cardiologist or surgeon to know where to place a bypass graft or stent , without any further tests , so this is a real breakthrough for patients			2
dr @entity121 , a consultant cardiologist at @entity131 said : ' we 're delighted that the @entity139 team is leading the way with this research ... this is a real breakthrough for patients ' ' the technology will further improve the diagnosis , reducing the need for some patients to have more invasive tests afterwards			1
' it will also help doctors decide which arteries need treatment - even which bits of which arteries - and will guide therapy			0
' a prototype computer system capable of detecting which heart patients need treatment is already in use in the @entity139 region			1
it works by creating a 3 - d model of the coronary arteries during an angiogram - where multiple x-rays of the arteries are taken - and reduces the need for further invasive tests and procedures			0
dr @entity96 , ( pictured ) , added : ' the @entity34 will act as a software - based laboratory for experimentation and treatment that will save huge amounts of time and money and lead to vastly superior treatment outcomes ' when complete the virtual human will be the most sophisticated application of computing technology in healthcare			1
a showcase of the work to date due to take place tomorrow in @entity139 will demonstrate the role the technology could play in treating diseases like @entity210 , pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease			0
the technology could also be used in managing the care of osteoporosis sufferers by using models of the patient ’s body to chart disease progress and predict fracture risk			0
the @entity50 leading the work is a collaborative between the @entity131 and the @entity12			1
the programme is backed by @entity223 funding .			0

scientists at @entity12 are developing cutting - edge software
could map the progression of individual diseases and help tailor treatment
leading heart doctor brands project ' a breakthrough for patients '
scientists say ' software - based laboratory ' could save @entity9 time and money
