by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 12:55 est , 7 march 2013 a schoolboy with an ' extreme ' hair style was escorted home by teachers who told him he would n't be allowed back in the classroom unless he had it cut			1
the teachers at the catholic school even offered to pay for @entity9 , 12 , to visit a barber but his guardians refused			1
@entity9 had his hair cut on tuesday			1
the sides were shaved off but the top and back were left untouched			1
' extreme hair ' : @entity9 , 12 , was escorted home by teachers at the @entity19 in @entity20 , because of his trim when he got to the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity22 , the following morning , after his £ 6 trim , he was told by teachers that he would n't be allowed into class			1
they insisted that he would only be allowed to return if he had his hair cut into a more acceptable style and was escorted home within 20 minutes			2
staff at the school even offered to pay for a new haircut , but @entity9 's grandfather and legal guardian @entity32 refused the offer and said he was ' livid ' with the whole situation			1
but the school says their policy on haircuts is clear and children 's attainment is linked to their appearance			2
mr @entity9 , 58 , accused the school of putting @entity9 's hairstyle before his education			1
he said : ' they wo n't educate him because of his haircut but it does n't state in their rules and regulations what type of haircut is permitted , all they say is it 's not school policy			2
' they say it is an extreme haircut			0
the member of staff explained because it is not level all the way round he wo n't be allowed in school until he gets it cut			1
@entity9 's grandfather and legal guardian @entity32 ( right ) said he was ' livid ' with the whole situation ' if it was a mohican or something i would agree , but it is away from his face and eyes			1
' they have even offered to take him to the barbers and pay to get it re-cut			2
' i will certainly not let them do that			0
it annoys me to death			0
' @entity80 ' guidance says pupils ' haircuts are expected to be ' reasonable ' with no hair dye and adds incorporated shapes and patterns are not acceptable			0
but mr @entity9 , unemployed , of the @entity87 area of town , says they do not specify which styles of haircut are acceptable and which are banned			2
@entity9 's attendance at school has recently dipped to 79 per cent because of health worries including asthma and a condition that makes his feet swell up , and his granddad is anxious the youngster does not miss any more time off school than is absolutely necessary			1
he added : ' i think it is a smart haircut			0
they are putting a haircut over his education , which is wrong			0
if they think a haircut style is more important than a child 's education , they want their heads looking at			0
' if we kept him off school deliberately we will get prosecuted but they send him home because of his haircut			0
he wants to go to school			0
he thinks it 's stupid			0
' @entity116 , headteacher of @entity117 and @entity118 , said : ' the school 's hairstyle policy is in the @entity121 and on our website along with other policies to ensure that parents / guardians are well aware of the standards we set at @entity129			2
' the policy clearly states that hairstyles incorporating shapes / patterns are not acceptable and that any student attending with an unacceptable hairstyle will be unable to access lessons in the normal way until this has been attended to			0
' in an effort to get @entity9 back into school , we did offer to pay for another haircut but unfortunately this was rejected by his family			1
' research by @entity145 shows that there is a clear correlation between high standards of behaviour , uniform and appearance and educational attainment and this view is shared by @entity80			0

@entity9 , from @entity20 , had sides of his head shaved off for £ 6
the following day , teachers told him he would n't be allowed into class
they even offered to pay for him to get it cut but his guardians refused
@entity9 's grandfather and legal guardian @entity32 was left ' livid '
