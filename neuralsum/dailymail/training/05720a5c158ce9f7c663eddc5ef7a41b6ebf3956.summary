two @entity1 sisters have disappeared from their home in @entity3 in what authorities fear could be the latest case of teenagers going to fight for @entity8 in @entity9			1
the girls , named only as @entity11 , 17 , and @entity12 , 16 , due to @entity1 privacy laws , have not been seen since 11pm on saturday , and their mother fears they could have gone abroad to join @entity15			1
if her fears are correct , then the girls will follow in the footsteps of @entity19 , 17 , and her friend @entity20 , 15 , who became poster girls for jihad after going to @entity9 in april			1
sisters @entity11 , 17 ( left ) , and @entity12 , 16 , may have become the latest set of @entity1 girls to escape abroad and join @entity8 after they disappeared from @entity3 on saturday @entity25 , the mother of the latest pair to vanish , said the girls ' father died last year from cancer and they had turned to religion in order to cope			1
she added : ' the two seemed to have been taking some comfort from religion but i was worried lately that they appeared to be getting a bit extreme			2
' they were acting a bit strange but as a single mum i was always so busy perhaps i did n't pay as much attention as i should			2
' i last saw them at the weekend when they said they were going to the shops and they never came back			0
they should only have been gone a few minutes but when an hour had gone past i worried , and when i looked there was no sign of them			0
' she said that her initial concerns turned into panic when she checked the girls ' rooms and found the both of them had taken their passports			1
the 46 - year - old mother added : ' going back over their behaviour now over the last few weeks i 'm convinced and terrified that they may have travelled to @entity9 to join @entity8			1
' if the sisters have travelled to @entity9 , then they will follow in the footsteps of friend @entity20 , 15 ( pictured ) , and @entity19 , 17 , who also fled @entity3 earlier this year @entity64 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) became known as the poster girls for jihad after their social media accounts were used to spread @entity8 propaganda after they fled to join the @entity15 fellow teenagers @entity19 and @entity70 disappeared in april , leaving notes for their parents which read : ' do n’t look for us			1
we will serve @entity74 – and we will die for him '			0
since then their social media accounts have been used to pump out pro-islamic state propaganda aimed at encouraging others to join them			0
the pair are thought to have been married to @entity80 rebels as soon as they arrived in @entity9 , and are both now believed to be pregnant			0
security sources reported earlier this month that both of the youngsters had been in contact saying they regretted their decision and wanted to return home , but were told it may not be possible			0
this claim had reportedly infuriated @entity8 leaders who are waging a constant propaganda war in order to lure young , impressionable people to their cause			2
according to anti-terrorism police in the girls ' homeland , it is almost certain that they would have been ordered to retract anything they had said to keep the flow of recruits coming			0
@entity70 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) , began posting images of their new lives abroad in an attempt to get other girls to join them , and now authorities fear @entity12 and @entity11 may have done exactly that an @entity1 security insider said : ' if they really want it to be believable that the girls are now claiming they do n't want to come home , they should let them give the interview on neutral territory where it 's possible to see that they are n't being threatened by a gun			1
' if the claim they want to come home is untrue , they have the opportunity to walk back into @entity9			0
' meanwhile @entity25 has filed a complaint with @entity1 police to say that her daughters are missing , but police and the @entity1 @entity128 have so - far declined to comment however , an insider said the disappearance was a cause for concern , and was being investigated .			2
