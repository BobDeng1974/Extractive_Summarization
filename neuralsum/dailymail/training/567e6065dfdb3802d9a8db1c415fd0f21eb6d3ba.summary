' it ’s a good job @entity46 was n’t going to @entity47 or he ’d have probably ended up with a hot dog			0
' when i first saw her in there i thought she was bound to be injured or badly burned - but , apart from being covered in oil and a bit shaky , she was fine			0
' now she ’s completely back to normal and playing with the children as if nothing happened			0
i ’ll definitely be keeping the front gate locked from now on			0

' i opened it and the little fella was just there glaring back at me , i could n’t believe it			0
' it ’s not the smallest dog and i still ca n’t quite work out how it managed to get itself there			0
