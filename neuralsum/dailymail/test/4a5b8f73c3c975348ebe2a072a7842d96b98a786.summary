in the end it took a searching ball from the cultured boot of @entity4 to settle this tie , a 70 - yard pass that caught out @entity7 for pace			1
this was far from a masterful performance by the @entity12 midfielder , but he was entitled to ease himself in to this @entity15 tie			2
@entity4 had , after all , been out for seven weeks with a calf injury before he was called upon to start this quarter - final tie			1
his 57th - minute pass , which sailed over the heads of the players in both teams towards the target of @entity24 , led to the controversial moment when @entity27 referee @entity26 awarded a penalty			2
@entity7 , who had been immense alongside @entity29 in the heart of the @entity32 defence , collided with the @entity12 forward as he made his way towards goal			1
@entity12 midfielder @entity35 steps up to score from the spot against @entity32 in tuesday 's @entity15 quarter - final first leg @entity32 defenders @entity39 ( left ) and @entity40 watch on as @entity35 strikes home a penalty to give @entity12 the lead in the second half @entity32 goalkeeper @entity44 can only watch on as @entity35 sends him the wrong way and puts the ball into the top corner the @entity48 international lets out a roar after giving his side the lead from the spot as goalkeeper @entity44 looks on at the @entity54 @entity35 celebrates and punches the air as @entity12 gained the advantage against @entity58 side @entity32 on tuesday night @entity12 fans are rapturous as the team celebrate having taken the lead on 57 minutes after @entity7 gave away the penalty @entity7 keeps his eye on the ball but trips @entity24 to give away a penalty - initial contact was seemingly outside of the area referee @entity26 pointed to the penalty spot after @entity7 and @entity24 crashed to the ground inside the area @entity12 forward @entity72 , pictured with @entity32 defender @entity29 ( left ) , showed off his impressive body art at full - time @entity12 : @entity75 7 ; @entity76 6 , @entity77 6.5 , @entity78 7 , @entity79 6.5 ; @entity35 6 , @entity4 6 ( @entity80 74 , 6 ) , @entity81 6 ; @entity72 7 , @entity82 7 ( @entity83 , 87 ) , @entity24 6 ( @entity84 , 83 )			1

manager - @entity108 : 6.5 referee : @entity26 ( @entity27 ) 5 man of the match : abdennour @entity35 settled it from the spot , putting @entity12 into a lead that they will need to defend when they travel to @entity118 for the second leg of this quarter - final next wednesday			1
it is far from over			0
@entity12 ’s coach @entity92 knows that , saving the legs of @entity4 by replacing him with the defensive mind of @entity80 a few minutes after @entity35 ’s opener			1
this team , who have set the pace all season in @entity130 and are 12 points clear of their nearest rivals @entity132 , were a touch disappointing in this first leg			0
@entity72 , who has scored six goals in the @entity15 , dropped off in search of the ball in to feet from @entity4 , but this was not his night			0
alongside him @entity82 faded after a bright opening and @entity24 ’s contribition was the incident which led to @entity12 being awarded their penalty			1
before that @entity4 had patrolled the centre of @entity12 ’s midfield with his usual classy touches , prodding around without being able to influence the tie in a way that he would have wanted			2
even so they failed to score in the opening 45 minutes because @entity35 , usually so dependable in this @entity12 team , could not find the target			1
everything was wayward , earning a deserved rebuke from @entity72 when he screwed wildly over the crossbar of @entity32 keeper @entity44			0
@entity4 gave him the eyes after he missed another chance , streaking down the left before his right foot shot flew into the stands			0
in many way this was a subdued @entity12 performance , falling short of the standards they set when they beat @entity166 5 - 1 on aggregate in the second round			2
they would dearly love to reach another final , to win the @entity172 for the third time in their history , but it will take something special to beat the best teams left in the tournament after the second legs are played next week			0
there is no guarantee they will survive the second leg because @entity108 ’ s team are an adventurous bunch , playing without fear after their fine run in the competition			0
they had chances here , notably from @entity192 , the man who scored @entity32 ’s third goal at the @entity194 on that memorable night in the previous round			2

after that @entity32 sat back , allowing @entity72 space at the back post to draw a save from @entity44 and giving left - back @entity79 scope to maraud down the flank			0
ultimately this tie was decided from the penalty spot , a complex and strange decision that was made after a long pause by the @entity27 match official			0
@entity35 took the chance , but @entity4 was the undisputed match - winner			0
