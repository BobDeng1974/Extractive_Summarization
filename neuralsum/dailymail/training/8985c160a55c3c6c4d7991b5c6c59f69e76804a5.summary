even for a doctor used to the carnage of war , it was a sight which instilled panic and fear			2
as appalling figures reveal that 3,600 people in @entity8 have been treated for neurotoxic symptoms – and that 355 of them have died – one of the courageous medics treating them has spoken about the horrors of wednesday ’s chemical attack			1
@entity14 , a 38 - year - old @entity8 gp , has described the moment he watched hundreds of dying men , women and children arrive at his makeshift hospital on the outskirts of @entity22			1
there were toddlers and babies gasping for oxygen as their air supply was slowly cut off			2
hell : a man mourns over a dead body after what @entity8 activists claim was a poison gas attack by regime forces in @entity37 , @entity38 paralysis , foaming at the mouth and an inability to control bodily functions were also symptoms , which made dr @entity14 and his colleagues certain they were witnessing the effects of chemical weapons			1
‘ the look of horror in victims ’ eyes was what affected us most , ’ said dr @entity14			1
‘ all of us have been dealing with war victims for the past two years , but nothing could have prepared us for this			2
the situation was quite terrifying			2
’ as the international community argues about the exact nature of the weapons used , dr @entity14 has provided the first detailed testament of life inside a @entity8 civilian community contaminated by deadly nerve agents			1
anguish : a man tries to console a woman as she clutches at the dead bodies of children killed in a chemical attack on @entity70 in @entity38 he told @entity71 : ‘ we want the world to know what innocent people are suffering – for people to share our outrage and to stop this horror			1
‘ this is not about politics or taking sides , this is about stopping the extermination of people in one of the cruellest ways known to mankind			1
‘ not only are children being exterminated by the dozen , but doctors treating them are also succumbing to the chemicals as they go about their work			2
’ reports from human rights activists in @entity38 suggest that at least six doctors have died while treating victims			1
dr @entity14 trained at @entity96 and now works inside the rebel city of @entity37 , about seven miles north - east of the centre of @entity38 and two miles from the suburb of @entity100 , scene of the atrocity			1
he said : ‘ i was woken by a colleague on wednesday soon after 3am			1
the bombing is constant , and we are used to early calls , but this was an appalling escalation in the conflict			2
survivors : this little boy escaped , but 3,600 people in @entity8 have been treated for neurotoxic symptoms after wednesday 's chemical attack , and 355 of them have died ‘ my colleague said that there would be no shifts as we all had to deal with a massive emergency round - the - clock			1
‘ by 7am there were 630 victims , 422 of them women and children			2
sixty - seven had died by this time , with many more close to death			0
‘ all had the classic symptoms of chemical attack , ranging from asphyxiation to that terrible glazed look associated with nerve agents – pupils are contracted and muscles are in spasm			1
’ dr @entity14 said the most disturbing sight was row upon row of young children ’s corpses lying perfectly still and seemingly asleep			1
‘ there had been similar attacks in the past , but our suspicion was that the agents were diluted			1
wednesday ’s attack was a full - blown chemical bombardment , ’ he said			1
destruction : @entity8 army soldiers walk among the rubble in the aftermath of government attacks ‘ those who made it to the medical point were not even the worst affected			1
@entity152 families died in their own homes			0
‘ my friend @entity154 , a doctor , died at home with his grandmother			0
he was only 32 and was solely interested in caring for other people ‘ @entity154 ’s body was only found because one of us from the team went round to scramble him to get on duty			1
‘ people like @entity154 were dying everywhere – simply falling down in the street			1
others simply passed away in their sleep			0
at 5am on wednesday , a mother and her three - month - old baby girl came into the medical point , even though the mother could barely walk			2
toxic : soldiers wear medical masks after chemical attacks that caused victims to suffer asphyxiation , muscular spasms and death ‘ she screamed at us to save her little girl , but we could n’t do anything for her			1
she was too young for her body ’s system to cope			0
‘ another entire family of five arrived later , but each of them died slowly in front of us			0
we are all used to dealing with the classic wounds and other trauma caused by shelling , but not these horror weapons			0
‘ they are utterly inhumane			0
’ the @entity193 attack was concentrated on a heavily built - up area largely controlled by the @entity195 , with at least seven districts hit			0
all are just a short drive from the bunker where @entity200 is said to be commanding the destruction of his own people			2
weapons : @entity8 state tv broadcast these images of plastic jugs , gas masks , vials of an unspecified medication , explosives and other items allegedly seized from rebel hideouts in the @entity214 neighborhood of @entity38 dr @entity14 pointed to @entity217 president @entity216 ’s ‘ red line ’ speech of almost exactly one year ago , when he suggested that the use of chemical weapons would make international intervention in @entity8 inevitable			1
‘ that sounds like a hollow claim now , ’ he said			0
‘ the truth is that @entity200 is taking advantage of the lack of international action to exterminate potential enemies as quickly as possible			0
my patients are the principal victims of this thinking			0
’ by @entity231 , foreign correspondent more than 100,000 @entity8 lie dead			1
one - fifth of a 22 million population has been displaced			0
yet even a few months ago there were still supposed experts who claimed @entity200 , the @entity236 - trained eye doctor turned dictator , was a decent chap trapped by cruel circumstance			0
these deluded fools must surely have been silenced after the hideous deaths of perhaps 1,700 people in apparent chemical attacks last week			1
if confirmed , it will be the worst such incident since @entity246 ’s attacks on the @entity247 25 years ago			2
when there is slaughter on the @entity8 scale it seems almost academic whether people are killed by bullets or poison			1
but last year @entity216 said the use of chemical weapons was a ‘ red line ’ that would ‘ change my calculus ’			2
he was right : if the world is to have any rules of war , there has to be a response to @entity200 ’s latest outrage			0
the question , of course , is what ? this is already a proxy war , with fighters from 25 countries			0
i have spoken to refugees burned out of their homes by @entity275 forces who , like the @entity277 , side with @entity200			0
meanwhile money and munitions have poured into the rebels from @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284 – with a wink and a nod from the @entity287			0
now the contagion seems to be spreading			0
@entity289 suffered two more huge bomb attacks yesterday			2
@entity291 is struggling to cope with a massive influx of @entity8 refugees while @entity294 is again drowning in blood			1
amid all this , the @entity296 looks even more hopeless than ever , given the shameful @entity277 and @entity299 lock on any @entity301 action and a second - rate @entity302			0
yet if nothing is done , what message does this send to other rogue states ? and as the world wrings its hands , the jihadists and extremists grow stronger inside @entity8			1
for months , @entity312 and @entity313 have wanted a bolder stance , encouraged by their action in @entity317 that ousted another despot ( although this aided the collapse of neighbour @entity320 )			0
@entity322 , meanwhile , is haunted by another conflict : @entity324			0
this showed how doing nothing can turn out to be as fateful a choice as taking action			0
@entity330 ethnic cleansing rampaged for three years while a @entity332 government led @entity334 opposition to intervention			0
then came the 1995 massacre of 8,000 people in @entity338 , finally forcing @entity339 into action			2
there are no easy answers to the @entity8 dilemma			1
the easiest move politically is to arm the rebels , although their problem is not a shortage of weapons , and there is no point creating no - fly zones if we can not defend them against well - armed forces backed by @entity277			0
ultimately , we must ponder two profound questions			0
first , are we prepared to become embroiled in war in the @entity356 ? and second , do we really understand the impact of our actions if we do get involved ? the answers could define this decade .			0
