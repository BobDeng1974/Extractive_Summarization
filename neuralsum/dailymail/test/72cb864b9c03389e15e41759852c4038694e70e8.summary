two warring sisters were yesterday stripped of the right to control their aged mother ’s fortune because of the intensity of the hatred between them			1
the hostility between the women – one a 61 - year - old retired gp and the other a 58 - year - old radiographer – meant they would never be able to make rational decisions about how to deal with the 97 - year - old widow ’s property , a judge said			1
senior judge @entity15 said the elder sister could be jailed for attempting to alter a legal document , so she could gain greater control over her mother ’s money			1
the mother , who has dementia , lives in a care home in @entity24 , @entity25			0
she owns a £ 600,000 house , has savings and shares worth £ 100,000 , and has an income of £ 1,200 a month			1
the @entity31 case was brought by the @entity32 ( pictured ) - the regulator of agreements for people without capacity the judge said both sisters were unsuitable to control her affairs ‘ because of the intense acrimony between them ’			1
instead he appointed a court deputy to carry out this role			0
the ruling was made in the secretive @entity31 in which hearings are routinely closed to the public			0
the judge ordered that none of the family be named			2
senior judge @entity15 said the ‘ daughters do n’t see eye to eye			1
in fact , they detest each other			0
’ according to the @entity10 , the judge said , ‘ the two of them have been in the same room together on five occasions during the last five years , and on each occasion her sister has refused point blank either to speak to her or even acknowledge her presence			2
the only communication between them is by email , and this is usually rancorous in tone			0
’ the disastrous relationship between the two sisters and their failure to handle their mother ’s affairs as she slipped into dementia were revealed in a ruling by the secretive @entity31			2
the sisters agreed with their mother in 2007 that they should draw up an agreement to control her money and property if she became unable to do so herself			1
the mother , a widow since 1984 , owns a house in @entity83 worth between £ 550,000 and £ 600,000 , savings and shares worth about £ 100,000 , and has an income of around £ 1,200 a month			1
since suffering from dementia she has lived in a care home in @entity24 that costs £ 940 a week			2
however , the sisters have rowed over their mother ’s care			2
the dispute has involved the younger sister , the radiographer , objecting to her elder sibling ’s choice of care home - which is a two - hour journey away from her own house			2
it has also involved an accusation from the @entity10 that her younger sibling only visits their mother once a week or once a fortnight			0
the document drawn up by the sisters in 2007 to control their mother ’s affairs - an @entity106 - was put into effect in 2013			1
since suffering from dementia the mother has lived in a care home in @entity24 ( pictured ) costing £ 940 a week but senior judge @entity15 said that at some stage the elder sister had attempted to alter the document			1
she attempted to change the attorneys ’ appointment from ‘ joint ’ to ‘ joint and several ’			0
it meant that the doctor could take decisions on her own about the money , without reference to her sister			0
the judge added that when she registered the new document the gp ‘ knew that this statement was false			1
’ the @entity31 case was brought by the @entity32 - the regulator of agreements for people without capacity			0
the @entity32 told the court that there were no witnesses to the alteration of the document			0
judge @entity15 said there were criminal penalties for dishonestly tampering with an @entity106 @entity135 of the @entity32 told the court that ‘ it is more difficult to believe that a professional person with the responsibilities of the @entity10 would misunderstand the difference in appointment types ’			1
miss @entity135 added that the @entity10 said that her late aunt had agreed that the document should be changed , but ‘ while this seems plausible , it is alarming to see an attempt by reasonably educated people at amending an important legal document without any witnessing being attempted or legal advice being taken			0
’ judge @entity15 said there were criminal penalties for dishonestly tampering with an @entity106			1
he said the punishments could run up to two years in jail but any charges were a matter for the @entity157			0
he added that he thought prosecution would not be in the interests of the mother , who would be caused ‘ significant distress ’			0
the judge said of the doctor : ‘ notwithstanding the natural love and affection between them and the undoubted support she has provided to her mother in recent years , i find her unsuitable to be the donor ’s attorney			0

sisters , one 61 and the other 58 , unable to agree because of *mutual* hatred
judge @entity15 said one could be jailed for trying to alter a document
lost control of a £ 600,000 house and savings and shares worth £ 100,000
