for more than half a century they had scoured the world for it , put out feelers to any likely collector , sent its description to international auction houses			2
but there was one place the @entity9 did n’t look in their hunt for the rare antique @entity12 chest			1
it was under someone ’s telly in a house a few hundred yards away			2
money box : the chest was deemed worthless by its owner but has now sold for 63,000 times what he paid for it @entity24 @entity23 with the rare antique chest unknown to the museum and a legion of experts who joined the search , the exquisitely decorated 17th century lacquered coffer , one of only ten left in the world , was being used as a tv stand by an owner unaware of its exceptional provenance			1
yesterday the 4ft 8in lidded casket , bought for £ 100 and also used as a drinks cabinet , became a treasure chest in its own right			1
it sold at auction for £ 6.3million – and once again eluded the @entity9 when it was snapped up by a @entity44 museum			1
the ornate coffer , fashioned in cedar wood , metal and gold lacquer , is believed to have been made in @entity49 by master craftsman @entity50			2
it bears intricate depictions of celebrated @entity12 myths , including @entity54 , widely acclaimed as the world ’s first novel			1
what the illustrations do not reveal , however , is the extraordinary saga of the chest ’s travels from sought - after artwork to makeshift piece of furniture			2
the gold lacquered chest , made in @entity66 by master craftsman @entity50 for the @entity67 , had been sought after by @entity68 's @entity9 since 1941 the story begins in 1640 when the head of the @entity67 ’s @entity12 office commissioned an order including ‘ four extraordinarily fine coffers ’			1
they were sold 18 years later with other lacquerware to @entity77 first minister @entity76 , and added to his extensive collection			0
two were later acquired by @entity81 poet @entity80			0
@entity80 ’s daughter @entity82 married the @entity83 and the coffers would form part of the @entity87 contents sale of 1882 , staged to raise funds for the palace upkeep			0
the @entity9 bought one coffer and the other , a larger one , was sold to collector sir @entity91 , then to @entity93 colliery owner sir @entity92			1
when sir @entity92 died in 1941 , as one expert phrased it : ‘ it disappeared off the radar			1
’ unknown to the art world , a @entity68 - based @entity100 doctor called @entity101 had bought it at a bargain price – and later sold it to a @entity77 @entity107 engineer in 1970 for £ 100			1
at current values it would equate to roughly £ 1,250 – around 5,000 times less than the chest is now worth			2
experts were left stunned when the chest surfaced during a house clearance and was identified as dating back to 1640 @entity114 was , the @entity77 decided the chest would make a fine base for his television			0
and for 16 years , that ’s what he used it for at his house in @entity122 , just a three - minute walk from the @entity9			1
meanwhile the museum and other interested parties continued their search			0
when the engineer retired in 1986 he took it home to the @entity129 , where he used it as a drinks bar and store cabinet			0
it resurfaced only after he died , when his family began a clear - out			0
@entity24 @entity135 and his brother @entity136 recognised the chest ’s likely worth and traced its remarkable history before it sold in @entity77 yesterday			0
delighted @entity44 curator @entity139 , head of @entity141 art at @entity143 ’s @entity142 , said : ‘ the thing to note about this chest is that it is the best of the best : it was the best when it was made and the same still applies today			0
it has an incredible back story which makes it all the more special			0
’ the chest 's detailing has been very well preserved ... despite having had a television sat on it for years ! worth £ 6.3million ? ‘ yes , it was a lot of money , but you have to pay for quality and it is worth every penny			2
’ @entity156 , curator of the @entity9 ’s @entity141 department , said she was relieved the chest had resurfaced			1
she added : ‘ it would have been fantastic for us to have been able to bid for the chest but like many museums around the world we did n’t have the money			0
‘ i was delighted to hear the @entity142 had won the auction – it is a very fitting home for the chest			0

@entity9 had been searching worldwide for it since 1941
but the rare antique was being used as a tv stand just three miles away
the @entity12 antique had been expected to sell for just £ *200,000*
