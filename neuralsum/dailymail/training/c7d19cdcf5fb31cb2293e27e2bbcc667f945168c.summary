covered in blood and mud and clad in a bulky suit of armour with heavy chainmail protecting his head , there ’s nothing measly about @entity10 ’s new role			0
@entity11 , who played @entity14 ’s @entity13 pal , looks unrecognisable in these exclusive pictures taken on the set of his new film @entity17 – an adaptation of @entity20			1
@entity11 plays @entity20 , a @entity21 nobleman and friend of @entity20			1
in @entity24 ’s play , @entity20 is a minor character who serves as a messenger to the major players			0
but if these pictures are anything to go by , the manly 25 - year - old ’s role looks more robust			0
@entity11 , who played @entity10 in the @entity14 films , is @entity20 , a @entity21 nobleman , in enemy of man from @entity35 : @entity11 started working on the @entity14 films in 2000 when he was 12 years old in one shot we see @entity11 riding into battle atop a black steed , while another sees him caked in mud and blood against a background of flames			1
it ’s a far cry from his magical adventures in the @entity14 films			2
@entity11 began playing @entity10 – opposite @entity48 as @entity14 and @entity49 as @entity50 – in 2000 when he was just 12 and went on to star in all eight films			1
he is worth a reported £ 24million thanks to the @entity14 franchise and an expanding property portfolio			0
enemy of man is due out next year , and @entity11 is currently filming on location in @entity58			2
enemy of man , directed by @entity61 , stars @entity62 as @entity20 @entity63 plays @entity64 in the film , an adaptation of @entity20 the film ’s director @entity61 – best known for his acting roles in the movies 300 and @entity71 – said he wanted to make a film that @entity24 would have made had he been alive			1
@entity61 , who also wrote the screenplay , said he was ‘ stripping back the dialogue and cranking up the action for the timeless tale of war , regicide , betrayal and ultimately revenge ’			0
the film also stars @entity63 as @entity64 and @entity62 as @entity20			1
the role of @entity84 is still to be cast			0
it is a running joke among @entity62 ’s fans that the 54 - year - old actor dies in nearly every role he takes – most recently losing his head as @entity90 in the hit tv series @entity91 , which also stars dance			0
and as he is playing @entity20 , it ’s not looking good for @entity62 in this film either ...			2
