@entity7 , paralysed four years ago , relies solely on a specialist alarm system which works through a phone connection to his live - in assistant in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the connection is vital so the former signaller can raise the alarm should he have any problems or even suffer a life - threatening stroke			1
cut off : the ex-marine has been disconnected for almost a week , meaning he would be in serious danger if he suffered a stroke but the @entity22 's life was put at risk when @entity6 left him disconnected for almost a week			2
mr @entity7 , 24 , was cut off when he changed suppliers from @entity25 earlier this month			1
proud : mr @entity7 before his paralysis , which happened in 2008 he has been without the vital phone system since friday , with @entity6 informing him it would be another fortnight before the problem could be fixed , despite him telling them he could die if it was n’t sorted			1
mr @entity7 said : ' i need my phone line for my alarm and when i called @entity6 i explained i need a phone for my health and they were not willing to help at all			1
' i told them i could die as a result and they told me i would still have to wait two weeks			0
' this is why i have the alarm system			0
i can not wait - one day is long enough but to wait ten days or two weeks i can not do it			2
' in 2008 @entity45 commando , mr @entity7 was deployed to @entity46 on an @entity48 warfare training exercise			1

he suffered an injury to his spine leaving him paralysed			2
his only life - line was his specialist alarm system			2
but when he switched providers from @entity25 to @entity6 , he found he had not been connected as promised			0
it took five days for an engineer to visit his home , in @entity11 , @entity12 , on tuesday			0
but he said the connection still was n’t right and would only work for five minutes before breaking off			0
mr @entity7 said : ' it ’s just completely severed my independence - well what was left of it and to me a large company not even trying to accommodate me made me think twice who i will go with			1
' they were completely unwilling to budge trying to accommodate a disabled person			0
' i do n’t know what they would do if this was someone who was more severely disabled and could n’t voice their issues			0
' @entity6 said another engineer would visit him again to restore a full service as soon as possible			0
a @entity6 spokesperson said : ' we are sorry that , because of a fault , mr @entity7 has been without a phone line since friday and we have apologised to mr @entity7			1
