attack : miss @entity6 was walking through a carpark at @entity8 , in @entity9 , @entity10 , on a friday evening in march 2012 when @entity11 , 25 , pounced from the shadows as she approached her car ' it 's just the most powerless thing ever ' : as @entity11 forced @entity48 inside the vehicle and raped her she thought of reaching for the pepper spray in her handbag			1

in the aftermath of the attack , @entity48 became unrecognisable to herself			2

' because it ’s not even my shame to carry			0
' for me , it would almost be dishonest not to come forward and say who i am			0
i want people to know , number one , that i have nothing to hide			0
and it ’s not my fault			2
' she has now become an advocate for rape victims and is soon to train as a lawyer to ' put the needs of victims first '			1
' rape and sexual assault [ in @entity122 ] is an epidemic , ' she added			1
' in order for a victim of any sort of crime to heal they need each step along that process to be the best it can be			0
