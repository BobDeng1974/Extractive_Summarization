the @entity1 final can be the best occasion of a footballer 's life , or the worst if they crumble under the pressure			1
@entity7 and @entity8 contested the climax to the 2014 tournament , with @entity11 scoring a stunning late winner to win it for @entity14 's side			1
here , @entity17 's @entity16 , the ex-england and @entity19 defender , rates all of the players involved in the match			1
presence helped put off @entity37 when through on goal			1
@entity39 - 7 partnership with @entity40 good again			1
intelligent and economical with his passing			1
timed his tackles and interceptions perfectly			1
@entity26 - 8 ... @entity47 did well			1
saw the danger early and put his body on the line			1
only one with real pace in the @entity54 back line			1
@entity56 - 6 outpaced by @entity37 time and time again			1
had a good tournament but struggled against the runners from deep @entity60 - 6 very high tackle and was maybe a tad fortunate just to get a yellow			1
exposed by his side ’s high line			1
also missed good chance with header near end of the first half			1
great chance : @entity60 missed a fine chance to open the scoring for @entity7 with a header leader : @entity75 did a fine job in stemming the flow of the @entity79 attacks @entity75 - 7.5 made very important interceptions			1
crucial role in stemming the @entity8 runs from deep			1
@entity82 - 5 @entity84 appearance			2
unlucky to have that clash of heads			2
did ok before that but was a huge call to pick him			2
not sure i would have			2
unlucky : @entity91 had to go off after picking up a head injury in this challenge @entity94 - 8 @entity96 energy down the right - hand side but delivery needed to be better at times			2
movement , as ever , was incredibly intelligent			2
@entity100 - 7 quite quiet but still had chances to score			1
plays longer balls than the rest of their midfield and that gave @entity7 variety			1
@entity108 - 6.5 looked up for the game , worked hard off the ball			2
however , did n’t do enough in possession in final third			2
@entity113 : @entity19 playmaker @entity108 worked hard for his team on sunday night experience : @entity116 lead the line well at the @entity118 @entity116 - 7 a bit quiet			1
he ’s a finisher and was too reliant on everybody else bringing him into the game			2
did n’t have legs to keep up			2
substitutes @entity126 ( for @entity127 , 6.5 ) impact player normally but did job well on the left - hand side			2
@entity11 ( for @entity116 , 88 ) the best moment of his life			1
manager @entity14 – 7 not the right call to hand @entity91 his full debut			2
you were waiting for his @entity137 but not sure there really was one			2
@entity139 - 6.8 best moment of his life : @entity11 's technique was superb ... it was a superb touch @entity144 : @entity14 has been superb tactically all tournament @entity8 @entity146 - 7 looked very good and made a couple of smart saves , particularly in the first half			1
dealt well with crosses , too			2
@entity152 - 7.5 got forward well and made a few vital interceptions			0
so important for @entity8 and also made decent ventures forward			0
@entity155 - 6.5 was hanging on at times , just about making the right decisions			0
had just enough pace to get by			1
good for him that @entity116 is n’t fast			0
@entity160 - 6.5 much quicker than @entity155 so provides a good balance			0
not really troubled but dealt well with what was thrown at him			0
organised : @entity155 and @entity160 were solid at the back for @entity8 @entity165 - 7 another player with real pace			1
did n’t go forward very much but awkward to beat			0
it ’s not easy marking @entity40			0
@entity169 - 7 no - nonsense performance			0
was around the referee at every opportunity			0
@entity175 - 7 he linked the defence and front players			0
that meant he covered a lot of ground and was very calm on the ball			0
@entity182 - 6 quieter than he was against @entity183 , when he impressed me a lot			0
part of the hard - working midfield			0
was n't his day : @entity37 was encouraging for the @entity190 , but could n't quite lead them to victory @entity37 - 7.5 troubled @entity7 by running at them			1
worked hard and came very deep for the ball			0
poor miss early in second half			0
@entity30 - 5.5 missed such an easy chance — scored a harder one against @entity199			1
should have timed run better for disallowed goal , too			0
opener ? @entity30 thought he scored for @entity8 in the first half , but he was yards offside fluffed his lines : the @entity206 striker also scuffed his shot wide with just the goalkeeper to beat early on @entity209 - 7 has such pace			1
is so direct and made yards every time he got the ball			0
superb cross for disallowed goal			0
blow to lose him injured			0
substitutes @entity217 ( for @entity218 , 6 )			0
looked fired up , desperate to make impact			0
@entity220 ( for @entity221 , 6 )			0
@entity223 ( for @entity224 )			0
manager @entity226 – 8 @entity226 set his team up to be so much better organised than @entity228			0
referee @entity233 ( @entity234 ) — 7 big call not to send off @entity60			0
did n’t notice him too much , which is a good thing			0
was very firm @entity237 , who is difficult to referee as he is so mouthy			0
@entity238 : 74,738 father figure : @entity226 speaks to his players during extra-time off at half - time : @entity8 missed @entity209 's pace			1

@entity26 's pace at the back was crucial for @entity54
@entity11 scores winner with neat volley in 113th minute
@entity7 win fourth @entity1 at the @entity118
@entity30 missed two great chances to score for the @entity190
