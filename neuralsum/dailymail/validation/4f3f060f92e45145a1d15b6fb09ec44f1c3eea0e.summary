@entity1 leader @entity0 said he would use cash raised in @entity3 to fund a spending splurge north of the border @entity1 @entity0 has threatened a new £ 1billion tax raid on @entity3 to fund a fresh spending splurge north of the border			1
mr @entity0 said @entity1 would hit bankers with a new ‘ bonus tax ’ and slash the amount wealthy savers could pay into their pensions tax free			1
he said @entity1 would use this cash , almost entirely raised in @entity3 , for a range of giveaways in @entity17			1
mr @entity0 said he would introduce a ‘ @entity18 ’ , which mr @entity0 says will end long - term youth unemployment			1
about 5,000 young @entity17 aged 18 - 24 will be eligible for the jobs guarantee in the first year of the scheme			2
the £ 1billion package includes a £ 1,000 increase in bursaries for @entity17 students , a ‘ future fund ’ worth £ 1,600 for every 18 and 19 - year - old in work and free university tuition			1
the future fund , unveiled at @entity1 's spring conference , will provide teenagers who do not go to university with £ 1,600 to spend on what they ‘ need to get on in life ’			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ this is an unprecedented investment in our young people , only made possible by harnessing the wealth of the whole of the @entity41 , including the wealthiest in the @entity42			2
‘ it is a guarantee of opportunity that the @entity45 ca n't deliver because they do n't believe in redistributing from @entity46 to @entity47			0
‘ it is a guarantee that the @entity49 wo n't deliver because they do not believe in redistributing from rich to poor			0
’ ‘ this generation of young people has come of age when , for the first time , most parents believe that their children will do worse than they did			0
' mr @entity0 added : ‘ while the living standards of those retiring now are greater than previous pensioners , young people 's living standards have stagnated compared to their older siblings and parents			1
‘ the economic and social costs of a generation for whom the hope of youth has been replaced with pessimism over the chances of a better future may dog us for years to come			0
‘ but it is not too late to turn things around and to make the promise of a better future real			0
‘ it is not too late because this generation of young people have been educated for longer and to a higher standard than any previous generation			0
’ @entity0 said the @entity45 could not match @entity1 's spending pledge because they wanted to break away from the @entity41 on the jobs guarantee , mr @entity0 said : ‘ we will use a new tax on the bonuses of bankers here in the @entity42 and in the @entity41 's other financial centres			1
‘ we will use that funding to guarantee a real job , at at - least minimum wage , and to guarantee training for every young person too			0
‘ we offer the guarantee to all young people who are at risk of falling into long - term unemployment			0
‘ this will be a @entity17 @entity18 , delivered by a distinct contract in @entity17 , in partnership with employers , colleges and the @entity102			0
’ @entity45 work and pensions spokeswoman dr @entity103 said : ‘ given that @entity0 has voted in favour of tuition fees at every turn , @entity17 's young people wo n't fall for his empty attempts to buy their vote			1
‘ and despite @entity114 's disastrous economic record , youth unemployment is at its lowest level for five years in @entity17 as a result of @entity102 action			2
the @entity102 's opportunities for all scheme offers every 16 to 19 - year - old a place in work , education or training - and as a result , 90 % of school leavers are going into positive destinations			0
‘ mr @entity0 's warm words wo n't hide the fact that his party voted arm - in - arm with the @entity49 for £ 30 billion more cuts - at the same time as committing to wasting £ 100 billion on @entity133 nuclear weapons			2
‘ if mr @entity0 really wanted to invest in @entity17 's young people , he would dump this ludicrous policy in favour of nuclear weapons and back the @entity45 in spending the money on education , childcare and health			1
