' victim : @entity23 ( centre ) described the harrowing aftermath of the @entity4 bomb blast killer : @entity5 has admitted killing 77 people in the july 22 slaughter , but insists it was ' self - defence ' with blood soaking through his jeans and t - shirt , he cried for help until two people arrived to bandage his wounds with clothes he was carrying in a bag			1
he said : ' i felt alternately cold and warm			0
at that point i was sure i would die			0

blast : these cctv images show the moment mass killer @entity5 's car bomb exploded outside the @entity14 government building frightening : eight people were killed in the july 22 blast following @entity10 's testimony , @entity5 slammed a psychiatric report that declared him insane , insisting it was based on ' evil fabrications ' meant to portray him as irrational and unintelligent			1
he said : ' it is not me who is described in that report '			0
a second psychiatric examination found that @entity5 was sane			1
the five - judge panel trying @entity5 on terror charges for the attacks will consider both reports			1
@entity5 's mental state is the key issue that remains unresolved in the trial , since he has admitted to a bombing in @entity4 's government district that killed eight people			1

but he claims the attacks were ' necessary ' and that the victims had betrayed @entity14 by embracing immigration			1

that would de-legitimise everything you stand for			2
' @entity5 showed no remorse today as he listened to testimony describing the horrific injuries of the bombing victims , declaring instead if anyone should apologise it was the governing @entity75			1
he said he had hoped they would change @entity14 's policy on immigration after his attacks			2
he added : ' but instead they continue in the same direction , so the grounds for struggle are unfortunately even more relevant now than before july 22			0
' sounding irritated , the 33 - year - old accused the two psychiatrists who declared him psychotic of deciding on the diagnosis prematurely , saying their judgment was clouded by their emotional response to the attacks			1
he said : ' they lack expertise in evaluating violent political activists			0

massacre : police and rescuers recover the last remaining bodies from @entity134 and the surrounding waters three days after the shootings on july 22 last year horrific memories : mourners pay their respects next to flowers and @entity14 flags left in honour of those killed in the days after the killings investigators have said they do n't believe the group exists , and prosecutor @entity147 noted that the second psychiatric report described it as a ' fantasy '			1
' it is a real network , ' @entity5 insisted , saying that police can not conclude that the group does n't exist just because they have n't found it			2
' if you use that logic , then i did n't exist either before july 22 , ' @entity5 said			2
' i would n't want to be the police spokesman when the next attack happens in @entity14			2
' fears were also raised again today that @entity5 's trial is giving a public platform to a mass - murderer and could spawn copycat crimes by others who share his hatred of @entity168			1

col. @entity177 , the head of @entity179 's @entity178 , said security experts believe there have already been violent acts inspired by @entity5 , including an @entity185 extremist 's killing of two @entity187 immigrants in @entity188 late last year			1
he said : ' there is always the potential danger that someone who has n't been exposed to extremist propaganda could become interested in it and could undertake activity that is in violation of the law			0
' describing the confusion following the blast , police chief @entity199 said yesterday initial reports he received suggested there were two suspects , and two other bombs about to explode			0
when he heard about the @entity134 shooting , he started thinking the bomb and the massacre were the actions of the same person			0

but i did n't have any evidence for that , ' @entity199 said			0
turning to @entity5 , he added : ' i could not imagine there being two people with so many crazy ideas			2
' the self - described militant nationalist testified last week that he had expected to be shot by police after the bombing			0
