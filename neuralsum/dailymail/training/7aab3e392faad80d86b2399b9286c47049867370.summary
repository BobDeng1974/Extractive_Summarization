by @entity0 published : 07:20 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 20:18 est , 25 july 2013 a selfless father has won back his partner 20 years after they split – by donating his kidney to her			1
@entity5 , 53 , has rekindled his love with @entity7 following the extraordinary and brave gift that saved her life			1
the pair split in 1993 and lived 135 miles apart but stayed friends for the sake of their son , @entity13			1
when mr @entity5 , a courier , heard his former love was in desperate need of a donor when a chronic kidney condition flared up again , he stepped forward to help			1
together again : @entity5 and @entity19 reunited after 20 years when he donated a kidney to her he offered one of his kidneys and went under the knife when doctors discovered he was a perfect match			1
miss @entity7 , 44 , said : ‘ he did it after all this distance between us for years			2
he risked his life to do it for me and @entity13			2
at first , i did n’t think he would go through with it , but he went through all the tests and when he was nursing his own mother and having a tough time himself			2
‘ he did n’t look back			0
everyone was saying he wanted to get back with me , even the nurses at the hospital , and i completely dismissed it			0
’ she added : ‘ i ’ve heard of couples getting back together after years of separation , but not this way			0
we ’ve put everything that happened in the past behind us			0
’ illness : ms @entity7 received a kidney transplant when she was 19 but later needed another one miss @entity7 had her first transplant in 1988 at the age of 19 when a kidney was donated by her older sister @entity50			1
the pharmacy assistant separated from mr @entity5 shortly after @entity13 was born in the second half of 1993 , but the pair remained on friendly terms			1
in 2004 she moved from her home in @entity56 , @entity57 , to be nearer her sister in @entity59 when the symptoms of her complaint started again			0
she underwent five gruelling years of dialysis until mr @entity5 , who still lives in @entity56 , heard of her plight			1
after undergoing all the necessary tests , he donated his kidney to her in 2009 at @entity66 in @entity59			1
the first signs of their old love returning came as they spent two weeks recovering in hospital , when they would visit each others ’ room every day to talk			0
even after they were discharged the couple kept in more regular contact , and 18 months ago they decided to give their relationship another go			2
mr @entity5 said : ‘ giving @entity19 a kidney was a chance to repay her for all she ’s done for our son , she ’s brought him up all these years			1
‘ one of the strangest things about it was we had been apart for so long , but it definitely felt like the right thing to do			0
i was over the moon i was able to help			0
i had n’t any intention of us getting back together , that was n’t the reason for doing it , but it is a fantastic ending			0
’ miss @entity7 , who now spends her free time raising awareness of organ donations , is planning to move back to @entity56 to be with her old love			0
their son @entity13 , now 19 , said : ‘ it was a really good surprise to find out that dad was giving mum his kidney after all these years			1
i think him giving her a kidney and the time they spent with each other there got the ball rolling and after they were both discharged they started speaking a lot more often			2
‘ we joke about it all the time because it is such a weird scenario			0
@entity119 is really happy now though , i have seen a real difference in her since they got back together after the transplant			2
’ he added : ‘ i just hope other people see their story and sign up to become organ donors			0

@entity5 and @entity19 split up in 1993 after having son together
but when she needed kidney transplant he stepped forwards and donated
the couple have now *reconciled* two decades later after braving the ordeal
