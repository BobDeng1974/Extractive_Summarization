a security expert has published 10 million passwords and their corresponding usernames to shed light on how people pick their pins			2
@entity6 claims his move is for research purposes and is worried that it may incur the wrath of the @entity11 mr @entity6 said in a blog post that his decision to publish the data in full on monday evening - which was gathered from a thousands of global incidents over the last five years , instead of a specific hack - was so experts can better understand how people pick their passwords			1
for example , the data could be used to work out how often people include their usernames within their passwords , @entity31 reported			1
‘ analysis of usernames with passwords is an area that has been greatly neglected and can provide as much insight as studying passwords alone , ’ he wrote			2
mr @entity6 said that his decision to publish the data in full on monday evening , was so experts can understand how people pick their passwords			1
he stripped out necessary data to stop it criminal hackers ( illustrated ) using the passwords for unscrupulous means avoid favourite sports			1
‘ baseball ’ and ‘ football ’ were both in the top 10 worst password list			0
birthdays and years of birth are easy to guess with the help of personal information			0
common names such as @entity58 and @entity59 are insecure , with many making @entity61 ’s top 50 list , too			0
experts suggest using eight mixed types of characters , with seemingly random combinations if possible			0
they say that passphrases – short words with spaces or other characters separating them – are easy to recall and are relatively secure if seemingly random words are used			0
experts also advise having different passwords for different sites , instead of relying on one , which if hacked , could prove particularly serious			2
he said he is concerned that the publication of the data may get him in legal trouble , however			2
‘ recent events have made me question the prudence of releasing this information , even for research purposes , ’ he said , citing the example of the prosecution of @entity83 activist @entity82			1
' the @entity11 took advantage of him linking to a data dump to initiate charges of identity theft and trafficking of authentication features , ' according to @entity6			1
‘ i think this is completely absurd that i have to write an entire article justifying the release of this data out of fear of prosecution or legal harassment			1
‘ i had wanted to write an article about the data itself but i will have to do that later because i had to write this lame thing trying to convince the @entity11 not to raid me			1
’ in his defence , the researcher said : ‘ in the case of me releasing usernames and passwords , the intent here is certainly not to defraud , facilitate unauthorised access to a computer system , steal the identity of others , to aid any crime or to harm any individual or entity			2
‘ the sole intent is to further research with the goal of making authentication more secure and therefore protect from fraud and unauthorised access			0
’ to ensure that the logins could not be used for illegal purposes , he removed the domain portion from email addresses , mixed up data from different leaks so it could not be traced to any particular company and removed keywords such as company names or any data that could be linked to an individual			1
he also removed information that could be a credit card number and any accounts suspected as belonging to government or military members			0
‘ furthermore , i believe these are primarily dead passwords … and this data is largely useless for illegal purposes , mr @entity6 wrote			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ the sole intent is to further research with the goal of making authentication more secure and therefore protect from fraud and unauthorised access			1
’ a report by @entity61 released in january revealed that ‘ 123456 ’ was the most popular credential last year , followed by ‘ password ' ( illustrated ) this means that passwords have already been changed and that all the data is already available online			2
‘ … i have taken extraordinary measures to make this data ineffective in targeting particular users or organisations			0
’ in january , a report by @entity61 revealed that ‘ 123456 ’ was the most popular credential last year , followed by ‘ password			0
’ the most used passwords of last year were also the most insecure , causing security experts to urge users to pick less obvious login details to keep their information safe			2
the remaining top five most popular passwords were ‘ 12345 ’ , ‘ 12345678 ’ and ‘ qwerty ’ according to the firm , which develops password management software			0
the company , which is based in @entity164 , @entity165 , analysed files containing millions of stolen passwords posted online during the previous year			0
trustno1 as well as lazy number and letter combinations that can be entered with a swipe of the thumb , it also noticed ‘ easily guessable ’ passwords such as ' letmein , ' ‘ football ’ and ‘ batman ’ were included in its top 25 worst pins			0
new additions to the top 25 include : ' baseball ' , ' dragon ' , ' football ' , ' mustang ' , ' access ' , ' master ' , ' michael ' , ' superman ' , ' 696969 ' and ' batman '			0
also in the top 100 are swear words and phrases , hobbies , famous athletes , car brands , and film names			0
the firm has advised anyone using any of these top 25 words to change their password to something more secure immediately , because common passwords are easiest for cybercriminals to guess .			0

@entity6 claims his move to release data is for research purposes so experts can find more links between usernames and passwords
data is usually stripped of this connection in exposed hack attempts
mr @entity6 removed details that could be used by cyber criminals
but he still fears legal action and being raided by the @entity11 , a blog post says
