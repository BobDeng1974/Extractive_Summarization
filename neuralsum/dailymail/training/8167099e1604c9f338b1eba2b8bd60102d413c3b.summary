by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 07:57 est , 22 august 2013 the rate of circumcisions performed on newborn boys in @entity5 hospitals dropped 6 per cent over the past three decades , with an especially steep decline in western states , according to @entity5 government data released thursday			1
the national rate declined to 58.3 per cent in 2010 from 64.5 per cent in 1979 , according to the report from the @entity11			2
the tally excludes many circumcisions , including those performed in other places such as religious institutions and those performed later in life			1
all time low : baby circumcisions are becoming less frequent across the @entity5 with a 6 per cent drop over the past three decades broadly , rates fell during the 1980s , increased in the 1990s , and fell again in the early 2000s			1
during the period covered by the data , male newborn circumcision was most common in 1981 , at 64.9 per cent , and least common in 2007 , at 55.4 per cent			2
circumcision is a ritual obligation for infant @entity29 boys and is also a common rite among @entity31 , who account for the largest share of circumcised men worldwide			2
the wider @entity5 population adopted the practice due to potential health benefits , such as reducing the risk of urinary tract infections in infants and cutting the risk of penile cancer and sexually transmitted diseases , including @entity44			1
still , the practice has been the subject of heated debate , including efforts to ban circumcision in @entity50 and @entity51			0
the @entity52 said last august that the health benefits of infant circumcision outweigh the risks of the surgery			0
the @entity11 offered little explanation in the report for the falling rates but said fluctuations over the years followed changes to the @entity52 ' assessment of the procedure 's medical value			1
the center 's findings were based on annual discharge data of between 7,000 and 12,000 newborn boys at between 250 and 550 @entity5 short - stay , non-federal hospitals			2
in western states , the rate dropped to 40.2 per cent in 2010 from 63.9 per cent in 1979 , the center said			1
rates in the @entity75 were flat overall			0
in the @entity77 , they mirrored national trends			0
in the @entity80 , they increased from 1979 until 1998 and then declined			0
a variety of factors could be at work			0
the federal medicaid program for the poor has stopped paying for circumcisions in some 18 @entity5 states , and some insurers have balked at paying for a procedure without a strong medical justification			1
hospitalization lengths over the decades for mothers and newborns have come to be measured in hours , rather than days , prompting more circumcisions to be done in outpatient settings , said @entity97 , a professor of pediatrics at @entity99			1
the margin of error varies across the data in the report			0
the national rate , for example , has a relative standard error of roughly 3 percent to 5 percent .			0

baby circumcisions in the @entity5 have dropped 6 per cent over the past three decades
circumcisions in the western states are at an all time low of 40.2 per cent
*experts* believe the end of @entity117 coverage for the procedure in 18 states may be to blame
some insurers are refusing to pay for the procedure without a strong medical justification
@entity125 hospital stays mean circumcisions are often performed on an outpatient basis
