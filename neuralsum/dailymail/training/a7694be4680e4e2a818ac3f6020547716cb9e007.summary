ice sheets surrounding the @entity2 poles make up 10 per cent of our entire planet ’s surface , and it ’s thought @entity7 contains five million cubic miles of frozen water - so what would happen if it all melted ? @entity12 has created a series of interactive maps demonstrating the catastrophic effect @entity7 ’s ice could cause if it melted and flowed into the oceans and seas			1
this could cause sea levels to rise by 216 feet , devouring cities and even countries all the while drastically altering how continents and coastlines look , and wiping out entire populations			1
@entity12 recently created a series of maps similar to mr @entity29 s , demonstrating the catastrophic effect @entity31 s ice could cause if it melted and flowed into the oceans and seas			1
if these ice sheets melted , the rest of the world would be affected			2
in @entity38 , pictured , cities including @entity36 and @entity37 would be lost underwater , as would the whole of the @entity40 and most of @entity41			0
it would also cause the @entity43 to expand and swell the @entity44 how @entity45 would look if the ice sheets melted			2
a large proportion of the country would be left underwater scientists believe it could take around 5,000 years for temperatures to rise significantly enough to melt all the ice on the planet , but claim the planet is already seeing the beginnings of this			1
over the past century , reports suggest the @entity7 's temperature has increased by around half a degree @entity60 and , according to the @entity62 @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , this has already caused sea levels to rise by around seven inches			1
the largest concentrations of ice on @entity7 are found in @entity66 and @entity67 but it is also found on exposed areas , on mountain tops and in other regions			1
the @entity67 ice sheet , for example , is so large it contains around 80 per cent of all the ice on the planet and its size has protected it previously during warmer periods in @entity7 ’s history			1
this includes during the @entity81 epoch - a period of increased global temperatures that lasted from 56 to 34 million years ago			1
during this period of time , little to no ice was present on @entity7 and there was little difference in temperature at the equator compared to the poles			2
warming oceans are already melting the floating ice sheet in west @entity67 and since 1992 , @entity12 reports the sheet has lost around 65 million metric tonnes of ice each year			1
the ice sheets in @entity66 and west @entity67 shrank significantly during the epoch and if temperatures were to rise in a similar manner again , the ice sheets across the regions could disappear into the sea completely			1
the last time the @entity7 was ice - free was 34 million years ago during the @entity81 epoch			1
if this happened again , the entire @entity105 seaboard in the @entity62 would vanish , wiping out @entity107 and the @entity108			0
while the hills in @entity110 would become islands and @entity112 would be lost forever if these sheets melted , it would create a knock - on effect for the rest of the world			0
in @entity38 , for example , cities including @entity36 and @entity37 would be lost underwater , as would the whole of the @entity40 and most of @entity41			0
it would also cause the @entity43 to expand and swell the @entity44			0
the @entity61 claims that overall ice reduction depends on several factors , including the rate at which levels of greenhouse gases rise and how global temperatures react to this increase in gas			2
the largest concentrations of ice on @entity7 are found in @entity66 and @entity67 , pictured			2
warming oceans are already melting the floating ice sheet in west @entity67 and since 1992 , @entity12 reports the sheet loses around 65 million metric tonnes each year			1
if they melted it could cause the sea levels to rise globally by 216 feet the @entity81 epoch was a period of increased global temperatures that lasted from 56 to 34 million years ago			1
during this period of time , little to no ice was found on @entity7 and there was little difference in temperature at the equator compared to the poles			2
the planet slowly cooled as carbon dioxide from the air locked inside seafloor sediments			0
during this decrease ice began to reappear at the poles , and the @entity155 ice sheet began to expand rapidly			2
this rise in greenhouse gases could be caused by humans , as @entity12 explained : ‘ if we burn all the @entity7 ’s supply of coal , oil , and gas , adding some five trillion more tonnes of carbon to the atmosphere , we ’ll create a very hot planet with an average temperature of perhaps 80 degrees @entity168 instead of the current 58			1
large swaths of it might become too hot for humans			0
’ this would make the @entity7 ice - free for the first time in 34 million years			1
if this happened , the entire @entity105 seaboard in the @entity62 would vanish , wiping out @entity107 and the @entity108			0
while the hills in @entity110 would become islands and @entity112 would be lost forever			0
in the east , @entity179 and @entity180 would both be completely flooded , wiping out around 760 million people based on current population levels.the coastlines of @entity184 would also be reduced			0
whereas in @entity187 , the @entity185 and the @entity186 would both become @entity105 inlets and this would wipe out @entity190 , coastal @entity191 , and some of @entity192			0
the only areas that would survive are mountainous stretches along the @entity196 coast and in @entity197			0
the other continents would escape a little more lightly , but would still be affected			0
in the east , parts of @entity201 , including @entity179 and @entity180 would be completely flooded , wiping out around 760 million people based on current population levels			0
parts of @entity184 's coastline would also be lost and eroded inland			0
@entity12 said : ' if we burn all the @entity7 's supply of coal , oil , and gas , adding some five trillion more tonnes of carbon to the atmosphere , we 'll create a very hot planet with an average temperature of perhaps 80 degrees @entity168 instead of the current 58 ' in @entity221 , for example , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 would be flooded but the continent would n’t lose as much of its land to the rising seas			2
@entity12 claims the @entity7 ’s rising heat ‘ might make much of it inhabitable ’ though			1
@entity227 would gain a new inland sea but it ‘ would lose much of the narrow coastal strip where four out of five @entity227 now live			0

the @entity7 contains around five million cubic miles of ice and 80 per cent of this is in @entity67 ice sheet alone
scientists believe it would take more than 5,000 years for all the @entity7 ’s ice to melt
@entity7 has *n't* been ice - free since the @entity81 epoch - a period of increased temperatures 34 million years ago
if this was repeated , sea levels could rise by 216 feet changing *shorelines* and *engulfing* entire cities worldwide
@entity12 has created a series of maps showing what continents would look like if the @entity7 ’s ice melted
