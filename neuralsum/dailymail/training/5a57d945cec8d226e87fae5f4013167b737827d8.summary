facebook users could unwittingly reveal intimate details about their personal lives by declaring seemingly unrelated information , researchers have warned			2
sexuality , drug use , political views and religious beliefs are all areas that can be accurately predicted by complete strangers monitoring online ‘ inferences ’ , they said			1
the threat to privacy has been created by the social network ’s ‘ likes ’ - the hugely popular system used to show approval of a range of subjects ranging from pop stars to chocolate bars , films , pastimes and interests			1
giving too much away : @entity26 researchers found they could predict the sexuality and race of @entity30 users with high levels of accuracy by looking at what they ' liked ' ( picture posed by model ) although seemingly innocuous , the information can be pieced together like a jigsaw to build up profiles			1
declaring support for human rights , wicked the musical , @entity42 and @entity43 can be linked to provide a strong indicator of male homosexuality , for example			0
drug use is suggested by ‘ liking ’ @entity49 movies , milkshakes and swimming , while high iqs are indicated by showing a taste for curly fries , @entity57 movies and @entity59 ’s voice			1
researchers predicted male sexuality with 88 per cent accuracy and correctly predicted race 95 per cent of the time			0
they also had an 85 per cent success rate with political leanings and 82 per cent with religion			0
campaigning organisation @entity68 said the technology threatened all aspects of people ’s lives			1
executive director dr @entity73 said : ‘ it ’s a nightmare scenario that @entity30 are entirely responsible for setting up			2
‘ this information can be used to pre-categorise people			1
banks could use it to decide who gets a loan			0
@entity68 issue : @entity30 refused to comment on claims that users ' privacy is not being protected ‘ it also creates the perfect surveillance state for governments , who will know what people are reading and their exact political persuasion			2
it is more invasive than @entity91			0
’ the study - private traits and attributes are predictable from @entity94 - was carried out by the @entity26 ’s @entity95 and based on the @entity30 profiles of 58,000 people in the @entity98			1
their ‘ likes ’ were fed into a computer algorithm which was used to predict a range of personality traits			2
accuracy was checked by comparing results with personal information provided by the volunteers , who were mostly aged between 16 and 30			2
few had clicked on ‘ likes ’ which explicitly revealed personal information about themselves			1
for example , just five per cent of homosexuals had clicked on links such as ‘ gay marriage ’			2
@entity95 operations director @entity115 said : ‘ we believe that our results , while based on @entity30 likes , apply to a wider range of online behaviours			0
‘ similar predications would be made from all manner of digital data , with this kind of secondary ‘ inference ’ made with remarkable accuracy - statistically predicting sensitive information people might not want revealed			1
‘ given the variety of digital traces people leave behind , it ’s becoming increasingly difficult for individuals to control			1
’ the findings will be of interest to the burgeoning online direct personalised marketing industry , which already uses ‘ cookies ’ to send tailored adverts to people surfing the net			1
but mr @entity115 added : ‘ i can imagine situations in which the same data and technology is used to predict political views or sexual orientation , posing threats to freedom or even life			0
’ fears about threats to the privacy of @entity30 users have increased since it was floated on @entity151 in a $ 100 billion share issue last year			0
analysts warned it would need to find ways of generating more income from its 901 million monthly users , including 30 million in @entity158			0
