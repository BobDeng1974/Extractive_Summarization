by @entity0 @entity1 may be stripped of assets around the world after an international court ruled it must pay $ 50billion in compensation for the government 's role in destroying the country 's largest oil company			1
yesterday 's verdict by the @entity11 increases the economic and diplomatic isolation of @entity1 at a time when it faces new , potentially painful sanctions from @entity17 powers			1
@entity18 was once @entity1 's biggest oil company , but was broken up after @entity20 owner @entity19 was arrested in 2003 , shortly after president @entity21 warned @entity1 's growing class of oligarchs against meddling in politics			1
@entity44 vowed to fight the decision , raising the prospect of a new round of legal battles as the shareholders seek to enforce the decision by seizing @entity1 state - owned assets in 150 countries around the world			1
they can attempt to seize any assets used for commercial purposes			0
that means that while embassies are safe , planes , art , commercial property , gas pipelines and oil rigs are not			1
' it 's the end of the beginning , ' said @entity66 , executive director of @entity67 , formerly @entity68 , whose subsidiaries brought the suit to the court based in @entity72 , @entity73			0
the court said @entity1 had used tax claims to take control of @entity18 in 2003 and silence its ceo , @entity19 , an opponent of @entity21 who had begun to use his vast wealth to fund opposition parties challenging @entity21 's power			1
@entity18 was broken up after @entity20 owner @entity19 ( left ) was arrested in 2003 shortly after president @entity21 ( right ) warned @entity1 's growing class of oligarchs against meddling in politics @entity19 was arrested at gunpoint as he boarded a plane in @entity87 that year and spent more than a decade in prison as @entity18 's main assets were sold to a state - owned company			1
monday 's ruling , one of the largest commercial arbitration awards in history , adds to @entity1 's economic problems just as the @entity96 and @entity97 are debating further sanctions against the country because of its support for rebels in eastern @entity102			1
though the country has ample reserves , uncertainty over the impact of the sanctions has seen economic growth forecasts plummet and investors are pulling money out of the country at almost twice the pace as last year			0
the court 's three - member panel , chaired by @entity116 , @entity117 's former permanent representative to the @entity118 , determined @entity1 was not acting in good faith to collect taxes when it levelled massive claims against @entity18 , even though some of the company 's tax arrangements might have been questionable			1
the state launched ' a full assault on @entity18 and its beneficial owners in order to bankrupt @entity18 and appropriate its assets while , at the same time , removing mr @entity19 from the political arena , ' the court said			1
broken up : the former @entity44 headquarters of @entity18			2
the court said the @entity29 launched ' a full assault on @entity18 and its beneficial owners in order to bankrupt @entity18 and appropriate its assets ' the blunt verdict accusing the @entity29 of giving the go - ahead to crush one of the nation 's biggest companies contrasts sharply with earlier cautious rulings from other international courts , which were carefully phrased to avoid blaming the @entity1 leadership for destroying @entity18			1
the dismantling of @entity18 and the arrest of @entity19 were a defining moment in @entity21 's rule			1
it was then that his government began to take back control of the country 's energy industry and sought to re-assert itself internationally as a force to be reckoned with rather than a crumbling post-communist shell			1
@entity21 most recently went on to assert @entity1 's claims over @entity155 , annexing the peninsula on the @entity157 in march , and to offer support to rebels in @entity102 's east			1
but the wake - up call for the @entity162 began in the early 2000s , when @entity21 forged a deal with @entity1 businessmen who had created empires by snapping up the jewels of the @entity168 state in oil , gas and chemicals			1
the @entity29 offered its protection for the oligarchs ' often murky deals			0
in exchange , the tycoons pledged to not meddle in government policy			0
@entity19 was the only man who broke this rule			0
after his imprisonment , @entity18 ' main assets were ultimately bought up by state - owned @entity181 , making it the largest oil producer in @entity1			1
in monday 's ruling , which was dated july 18 , @entity1 was ordered to pay the damages within 180 days or begin paying interest			2
if @entity1 declines to pay , shareholders can attempt to seize @entity1 assets abroad			1
' we 're over the first and most important hurdle , ' @entity66 said			0
' it 's now a question of enforcing it			0
' damning : the verdict by the @entity194 ( above ) in the @entity72 increases the economic and diplomatic isolation of @entity1 at a time when it faces new sanctions from @entity17 powers the amount of damages , although half as much as originally claimed , is colossal - nearly as much as @entity1 spent on the @entity202 in @entity203 , the most expensive @entity204 in history			2
@entity1 's options are limited			2
though the arbitration decision is final , it can seek what is called a ' setting aside ' of the award before courts in the @entity73			0
the threshold for review is high , however , and lawyers for @entity67 said they were confident @entity1 had no chance on that front			2
the @entity1 finance ministry said it would take that path , fight what it called a one - sided and political verdict in the other courts in the @entity73			2
foreign minister @entity221 said @entity1 authorities ' will use all possible legal means to defend their position			1
' @entity225 , the top beneficiary of a trust controlling @entity67 that has launched the suit , told @entity228 radio shareholders would search for and freeze @entity1 assets around the world if @entity44 does n't pay up			2
@entity225 pointed at a suit won by a @entity234 company , @entity233 , which claimed $ 1.1 billion from @entity1 and led to seizures of @entity1 assets worldwide in 2008			2
it eventually forced @entity44 to opt for a settlement			0
@entity19 , who had given his stock in @entity18 to @entity225 , said the ruling will make a ' strong impression ' on @entity21 , saying his lieutenants had sought to downplay the likelihood of such an outcome			1
' i 'm sure that they have n't told @entity21 how disastrous the ruling will be , and i 'm very happy today , ' he said on @entity228			0
though the case has been a decade in the making , the timing of its release is unfortunate for @entity1 , experts said			0
between the crisis in @entity102 , the possibility of sanctions and the payment of a massive judgment on @entity18 , investors in @entity1 now face ' the perfect storm , ' said @entity260 , who teaches finance at the @entity262 in @entity263			1
@entity264 said that while @entity1 could probably handle paying $ 50 billion , not paying could prove more problematic			0
' foreign investors are going to be on the sidelines waiting to see how they handle this , ' she said			0
' they will look at this and see if the @entity1 respects the rule of law			0
' the main stock index in @entity44 fell almost 2 per cent on monday			0
@entity181 said in a statement it is not party to the litigation and it did not expect to be affected by it			0
it believes the deals to purchase former assets of @entity18 ' were fully legitimate			0
' shares in @entity181 were down 3.6 percent in trading in @entity281			0
monday 's decision is not the only one facing @entity1 this week			2
the @entity283 is set to rule on thursday on another @entity18 lawsuit - one involving 55,000 shareholders that were not part of the @entity287			2
this group includes $ 6 billion in investments by @entity96 pension funds and other institutions			0
no one involved seems to think this is even close to over , with lawyers on all sides taking up positions			0
' the @entity18 affair is likely to come back to haunt the @entity1 , ' said @entity298 , a senior fellow at the @entity299 in @entity300 and a long - time @entity1 watcher			1
' you do n't steal companies			0
